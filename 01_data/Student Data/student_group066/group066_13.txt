While they didn't have what I was looking for, I needed to take a short break and sit for a few minutes, and the doorman was very helpful, getting me a chair and even answering my questions about another store, Target or otherwise that would have what I wanted.</review>

< Review>
This a very small target with limited items in each department - Starbucks, food and produce market, electronics, home, women’s clothes, beauty, and pharmacy. No toys and I didn’t see any men’s clothes. It’s more like a neighbourhood store so good for everyday items for locals. Because of its size and limitations I’m giving it 3 stars. Outside signage could also be better so some may miss it if they’re not looking.</Review>

<text>THIS IS A GARBAGE STORE!!! FRAUD STORE, SCAMMING PEOPLE ON TARGET STORE ON BLACK FRIDAY !!!!! THIS IS A TRUE STORY!

i was on blackfriday doorbusters, and i was in the first 10 ppl in the line to the entrance! Items i wish to buy at blackfriday where PS4 199$ and TV 55" ELEMENT 199$, just this two items, so i ran into the store pick up the items and have been moved fast to the check out counter, and guess what this ELEMENT TV 55" was 349$ instead of 199$ i started argue with a manager about that, - how it is possible that TV on the MAIN PAGE OF YOUR TARGET DOORBUSTER MAGAZINE was 199$ and you trying to sell me it for 349$ and the manager told me - THERE WAS A SPECIAL TICKETS ONLY 100 of them! , THAT WAS ON INTERNET WHICH ALLOWS YOU WITH THIS TICKET, BUY THIS TV FOR 199$ instead of 349$, (THERE IS NO SINGLE WORD ABOUT IT IN THE DOORBUSTRERS MAGAZINE) and i didnt know about that, and the price of 349$ on black friday was the regular price of any TV with 55" which i can buy, from any store online, with free shipping!!!!!! this situation ruined half of the day! i was standing around 3 hours on cold winds, just for that!

So i wish my story will read a lot of future or regular costumers, and hope you guys choose another store, because this one i don't recommend because of they fraud things, scam things, actually they scammers, i wish my blackfriday was at home with my family! instead i got worst experience in avail and i will never go to TARGET any more, thanks for reading this!

if i could i would rate 0 STARS!

and sorry for my poor English...< /text>< pictures>

This is a great little capsule Target store taking residence on the corner and part of the first floor of an office building--right in the middle of the Financial District near Market Street. It's not a full size Target so, of course, don't expect them to carry everything a suburban Target store has. But they've got a small refrigerated section, fresh produce, and shelves with a small selection of food/snacks, a small selection of clothing, pharmacy/toiletries/beauty items/first aid/medications, etc. It's a Target with the basics needed for a city dweller or worker. It was super easy to swing by this location on a lunch break or after work, and grab the BART train on Market or make the walk down Market to the Ferry Building to catch a ferry out of the city.< /Text>

Who knew this little gem was in downtown. When items are on sale the prices are even better. The chicken in the deli section beats out Safeway and all of those. The fruit is fresh, and the strawberry shortcake is wonderful as well. Such great customer service as well. And a decent selection of sushi as well.</Text>

<Date>1550407167413<//Date><rating>1<//rating><text>Not only is this Target tiny and doesn’t have much stock (aka you are probably better off going somewhere else), customer service is disgraceful when returning items without a receipt. The store is quite happy to take tourist dollars but will not allow said tourists to return items without a receipt, esp. if you originally paid in cash. They do allow returns without receipts only for American citizens or residents as they only recognize US passports or US driver’s license when requiring ID proof. They do not recognize foreign passports or foreign ID cards for ID proof. Very discriminatory treatment, reinforced by the supervisor of this store, who was highly condescending as well. If this is the real corporate policy and she was only implementing it, shame on you, Target. But if this was a discretionary decision on her part, Target needs to have a review of the kind of employees it keeps..

If you are a tourist, stay well away from this store. The other Target on Mission St. is very good though and comes highly recommended. It’s a much bigger store and carries quite a good range of items for a “city” target, and the staff processed my returns with great customer service - go here instead!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Due to its "tiny" nature, this target won't have the full selection of EVERYTHING you would find at a full-size Target, but I find it gets the job done for the essentials. This Target is kept up really well and is clean every time I visit. I find that the staff here tend to be friendlier compared to the Metreon Target, but that could just be due to chance.<//review>< UserId.>

I would like to give this Target 5 stars because I appreciate the convenience of it more than anything. The only downfall is the limited selection. It's not a Target you would do your full shopping trip at. Useful for quickly picking up a thing or two during your work day.<//review>

<text>Mini Target. Central location in FIDI. Quick in and out. Carries a well selected group of merchandise for fill in shopping.  Prepared food and salads with some groceries. Pharmacy and health and beauty aids. Generally lots of cashiers to keep the line moving. The staff is actually cheerful.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Don't forget the customer service, instead of following people of color around the store and making what should of have been, an enjoyable shopping experience, a distasteful one.

Just because people steal, doesn't give you the right to assume I am one of those people.

Gonna file a formal complaint, because I Love Target, and this store needs to improve.

Tact, it's a thing.</review>< date>

Be careful. Much smaller than an average targets. Surprisingly there is a much bigger target just two blocks away. Not sure why they opened a branch here.<//Review>

This Target in patricular I will never return to. Because of the Starbucks employee. She yelled and was absoloutely vile unprovoked. Got the order wrong and was hostile from the start.  The manager did refund my coffee but it's not about the money. He continued to allow the employee to yell across the store.  The experience was one for the books and that type of person does not belong in any Target or Starbucks establishment .<//text>

<review>I was really upset at this store .. the african american lady that works there was so rude to me. She looked so unmotivated to work. She looked at me from the bottom to the top like if i was inferior and rolled her eyes at me.. she was mumbling something about latino people. i think that was because of my nationality or accent.. im gonna think twice before buying on target again.. really dont wanna feel treated like that again.  I was there friday march 15 2019 at night.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

In a space that was fornerly a Wells Fargo branch office, with beautiful high ceilings and windows, is this very smartly stocked Target.  Lots of fresh food, phone chargers, cute notebooks, a couple scarves, a Starbucks, and so on.  I especially like that they have staffed this so there is never a long line.  Nice staff.< /Review>

They have all the daily/office necessities in a perfect  spot. Don't expect the selection of a full target, as this is a much smaller location. However if you need a snack, drink (alcohol included) or items for travel; this store has your back. Always quick and friendly staff here as well.</Text>

This is a smaller Target store. It's located in the middle of the city so it's very convenient. Although it's much smaller than a regular Target store. More like a cross between a large Walgreens and small Target. And the prices are much higher than regular Target store. Points for cleanliness. Take off a point for how expensive.<//Review>

My rating is specific to the PHARMACY ONLY, but I imagine the service elsewhere is good too-

The pharmacist and staff handles client flow well, but their personal customer service efforts, especially interactive dialogue on effects of your prescriptions, is what brings me back. I wish my doctor had this gift-</Review>

<Review>I don't often get to this Target but it is closer to my home. It is not as large as the one in the Metreon but has the staples you might need, supplies, household products, food products, cosmetics etc. I just went there to see if there were any sales on products. They had some sales on salad mix greens and raspberries. I bought an avocado not seeing any prices listed and it was just $1.39. A bargain because they are even more expensive at Trader Joe's now. I will go back to buy more.</Review><name>Kathryn Din</name>< Date>

This is a smaller Target, but I'm thankful to have one in the Financial District AT ALL. Has the added benefit of its mere presence keeping Walgreens on good behavior. Walgreens has no choice but to try and compete with Target, so Target's presence is keeping Walgreens' prices competitive, too.<//Review>

However, I dont like their security, if they suspect you of theft, they will embarassingly confront and interrogate you in front of other shoppers and that is very unprofessional of a publicly traded company.< /text>< GmapID>

Basic Target.  In FIDI so the place is smaller than your average suburban Target.  Selection is decent.</Text>

When Target first came to the city I was totally against it.

I go here three or more times a week because it's clean, fast friendly and they have what I need for less.< /Text>

Great location for when you don't want to walk the extra blocks to the target on mission & 4th. It's really tiny compared to other target stores however they do have the basics milk, eggs, bread etc and the prices are same as the other target.< /Text>

City Target!!! Cosed on Sundays and only open 8am -5pm on Saturdays. It's a smaller Walgreens-esque Target with only the essentials.</Text>

the hours are awful considering this is the 4th Target store in San Francisco. The Metreon Target is open the same hours as most of the larger Target stores in the bay area, and I've had much better luck with The Metreon Target since its not scaled down so much.<//Text>

Not a real Target, more of a mid-sized CVS.  Don't expect to find anything here that' not at the Walgreen's across the street, or the CVS a block or two away.   But, you can pick up merchandise here that is carried at real Target stores.  Don't know how long it takes them to get stuff here, but I'll look into that next time.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Items at a good price, really recommended not to overpay on other sites, the bad thing is that it is not really very big

(Original)
Artículos a buen precio, realmente reocmendable para no pagar de más en otros sitios, lo malo es que no es realmente muy grande<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The target here is small.
However, stationery, clothes, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals are kept compact.

The pizza is amazing all the kids love it, so do we.  The owner and staff go above and beyond to make your experience a great one.  The owner even walked pizza out to our car while we waited outside.  We will be back over and over again.  Great service great people equals repeat buisness wish more places treated customers like this< /review>

<time>1580165424030<//time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>This park should be spotless its in an upper middle class area as I was there playing with my son two city workers came by hosed down the restrooms and checked two trash cans then sat in their truck for what was about 20 minutes scrolling on there phones. I could see in a radius of 20 meters trash that should have been picked up. I don't know if city workers have the authority to keep transits moving but one managed to make them selfs quiet comfy under a table like it was home sweet home. I don't have a problem with the herbs but keep it away from kids and any areas where they play. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME AFTER 20 YEARS OF LIVING HERE WHY ARE THE TENNIS COURTS ALWAYS 🔒LOCKED 🔒< /Review>< pictures>

It's been a place I could go, walk my dog & park in the shade. Am currently homeless & the park was "safe". Suddenly, today 2 police officers said I was "loitering" & if I was still there in next 30 minutes, they would have my car towed! I was unaware of a "time limit" for enjoying peace & quiet...<//text>

<Review>Creepy people around so if you are bringing the kiddos just watch them carefully. I used to take my kids here when they were younger. It was much different back then. I felt very unsafe on the walking path during my last visit.  Just be alert.  Plenty of parking.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>It's fairly close to my house, the restrooms are dark and not in the best condition. The toys in the play area are fun and my 2 and a half year old really enjoys them. The sand is pretty dirty, ok I get it, it's dirt and suppsed to be dirty but there are all kinds of things in the sand it could use a good sifting. There are a couple covered patio areas with tables and trash cans and the grassy areas are nice but people are careless and leave behind their trash.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<rate>3<//rate><text>Went today, apparently someone had a birthday party and failed to clean up afterwards. We did our best to clean what we could but the whole park needed a good cleaning, will return with grabbers and spend a few minutes picking up trash that's just scattered around the park. Restrooms are there. However, there are no doors on the stalls. There was no toilet paper and the floors were covered in urine. There is no soap provided to wash up afterwards and the restroom is very dark, please take your children in there and don't let them go alone. There are two gazebos that cover around 6 to 8 tables with a few bbq grills. There is a basketball court, a baseball field, a small grass area for kicking or throwing a ball around, a playground and a tennis court.</text>< pics>

<Text>The playground area has potential with a wide range of options for kids to choose from. What was lacking during my visit with the kids was cleanliness. The playground area was littered with trash, which was a major turn off as my little guys were running around. At times my kids were more focused with random trash items on the ground then the playground. We did end up cutting our stay short that day and will be researching other parks in the area for a better experience.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Taking our dogs to that park so we can play with frisbee and ball.  Couple bunnies there that get too close to road, at times.  Fun and exercise for us all.  Weekly, if not more, leisure we look forward to.< /text>

More green spaces are needed. Many Bushes and trees are dead. Trash throughout walking path. Graffiti on benches. Spillway littered with trash and debris. It's a great place to walk, wish the landscape could be improved upon.<//Review>

<review>Grrat little Park for the lil ones. BBQ pits, swings for infants, jungle gym, titter totter and a Zipline. There's a baseball field that needs work and a basketball court too. Only concern was with a guy that smokin dope in the little rivean at the back of the park. Guess it should be expected in Hemet/San Jaghetto.< /review></record>

My kids like this park and it's close to home, only thing is the shady people washing their hair and clothes by the restrooms and the cars with people just sitting in them doing who knows what. I wish someone in charge would come by once in awhile to make sure unsavory things aren't going on.< /Text>

<text>I frequent this park often, since I live in the area.  I am disgusted by how this park as well as the majority of the other parks and public trails and public areas are maintained in San Jacinto.  I watch the maintenance crew that supposedly maintains Rancho Park weekly, do a crappy job.  The park is disgusting with trash blown with leaf blowers, from one area to another area weekly.  The covered pergolas and trash containers are filthy with spilled food, vomit, body fluids etc. that are never cleaned or repaired.  Most of the picnic tables and benches are either damaged or completely missing. Complete areas of the grass areas are dead or overgrown with weeds.  All the maintenance crew does weekly, is cut the grass, use weed whackers to edge around walk ways and blow trash and leaves around from one area to another area each week,  The shrubbery, trees etc.  look terrible, or are completely dead.  The dead shrubbery or trees are never removed or replaced.  Squirrels, gophers and moles have destroyed the grass areas and the weeds have taken over.  All but two of the bar-b-que pits are rusted thru and unusable.  This is a newer park and I think it is insanity that homeowners, who pay extra tax assessments must pay for 30 years for maintenance of the public areas of San Jacinto, and it is not maintained properly, at all, or done in a totally inefficient way.  Don't waste your time going to any of the parks in San Jacinto.  There are many other beautiful parks in nearby cities, that are a much more pleasurable experience, than any of San Jacinto's parks and trails.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80db68d0eb45f7c1:0x133d532713de21c7<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Broken bottles were on the walk ways, it wasn't safe for the children and joggers to use.
Normally this park is OK,  I think some teenagers got a hold of some liquor and threw their empty bottles on the pathway.<//review>

Fast and friendly drive through service.  Parked it the lot and then ate on the patio which is nicely maintained.  Though I don't live in this neighborhood anymore, it's nice to be able to come back to places like this that I used to go to over 20 years ago.</Text>

I go to this place quite often! This is my favorite spot to to have a good dinner.  I go there at least once a month. The cooking is just great, the staff members are friendly and the charge is good. I enjoy meeting in this place over a good supper.</Text>

<Text>I just had the best customer service experience ever here! I work as a manager at a local restaurant and got off work late tonight so at 11:00 at night I decide I want Taco Bell. The gentleman working the register was so nice when I changed my mind about what I wanted to order and was very polite and friendly without being too friendly where its obviously fake. This location usually has good service but this was the best by far! My only regret is not getting a receipt so I could fill out a survey so corporate could see it!<//Text>< name>

<UserId.>108214021403448315725< /UserId.><review>Horrible experience here. I ordered through the app and I guess they gave it to someone else accidentally. So I waited like 20 minutes while they made it over. Then I asked for straws and mild sauce and they assured me it was in the bag. It wasn't. I also didn't receive some of the items I paid for. To top it off, my soda was completely tasteless because they hadn't changed the syrup on the machine but they didn't bother letting me know..I would've picked another option if I knew. I had a really long and stressful day working at my healthcare office and just wanted to have a dinner that I didn't need to stress over for my family. It was completely ruined. This was my worst Taco Bell experience in all the years I've been going to different Taco Bell locations. Very disappointing.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< time>

When walking up to the register (I had cash) the staff was so busy they didn't get to me for a while. All the while people using the kiosk got their food within a few minutes. It was 10 minutes before someone was able to get to me, and another 10-15 before my food was ready. I don't blame the staff; they were sorely understaffed.</text>< Pictures>

Taco bell has some nicely priced boxed meal deals. This particular location does have some issues with cleanliness of the floor and table tops as well as not refilling the hot sauce bins at times. But overall, it's a good spot for a quick bite.<//Text>

Excellent service and warmest welcome, they explained questions in detail and did not rush costumers. Everyone at the meeting loved the food, it was exactly as the pictures. Beautiful and delicious.
Thank you Nancy and managers< /Text>

Been eating at this Taco Bell since the 90s. Idk about. Everyone else but it's been pretty consistent since then. Which is good. I don't think enough people who like this place ever review, giving it a low average. So here's my 5 stars to help out. Keep it up Taco Bell.</Text>

I love me some taco Bell! For the price it's very good, only thing is it's got antibiotics:/. Also China owns them and I don't like supporting commies.<//Text>

If you're looking for a cheap, tasty treat, try the $1 Frito burrito. It's a good sized refried beans burrito with Fritos corn chips. Drown it in hot sauce. Yummy!< /review>

Wrist service ever. First time I went, I went through drive through.  I pay to get my tacos supreme and I get regular taco. Second time I tell them I want my tacos supreme and I ask if they were they said no but we can change it. So I get my food and go back to work and I find sour cream on top and on the side of my tacos. Is this how you treat your customers Taco Bell? Never coming back again!< /text>

Worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. The service is way to slow to even consider it a fast food joint. I've spent nearly 10 minutes waiting for a simple taco before when I was the only one in the store<//Review>

I pulled to the drive thru with two cars in front of me, one of them is completing an order. When he pulls forward the next car in front of me rolled down his window Anna waited to be attended to by the drive thru attendant. Sadly he was ignored. And then I was ignored. The employee on duty who was also the manager failed to let us know if the store just closed. Upset, I pulled up to the window and gestured to the young lady and glasses with dark hair to speak with me and she wrinkled her nose at me and ignored me. Now I'm pissed off. I called the store and got an answering machine message about how unprofessional this was and she pick up the phone and barked at me as if I were her father. I told her that the way she handled that situation was improper because she left to customers waiting the drive thru after having immediately taken in order. When she got rude with me I told her that I was going to file a complaint with corporate and she basically said go ahead I don't care. What a crappy establishment that doesn't hold their employees accountable or train them properly. I was so angry at the way I was treated I will likely go back and buy ten $1 items, individually, just so I can use the receipts to call and leave a terrible review for the store.

update 8.21.14: last time I came and got a grilled stuffed burrito and today's visit I got the same thing. Both visits were disappointing because  the burritos I got bin was almost all beans and rice maybe a tablespoon of meat . It is noteworthy that the receipt I received across the top read: for a survey and a chance to win look at the back of your receipt. Well there was a survey code on the front on the back it was completely blank which tells me either they ran out of receipt tape supplied by Taco Bell and we're using something else, or they purposefully replace the receipt tape with a generic so the customer does not have the phone number to call Taco Bell customer service and submit a survey<//Review>

Franklin's had my sons work truck for over a month while figuring out all that was wrong with it after it was sabatoged. They also worked it out with the insurance company for payment. It was great having them patiently working with us.</Review>

Great service.  Unfortunately neither of the two employees in the small office wore facial coverings.  They have signs to ensure that people follow safety protocols but I think the employees forgot to read them.< /Review>

< review>
My Fiancé was told to fix his thermostat to pass his smog check. So he bought the part, and fixed it himself because the quote was expensive (to us) at $300.00. He went in today, in hopes to pass his smog trying to avoid any more costs from the DVM. He told the employee that he had just changed the thermostat. The employee knowing he would fail, took his money for the smog and then told him he failed due to the fact that he has to drive the car at least 30 miles to get the computer to reset after a thermostat change to pass. Why couldn't they have told him this before they took his money for the smog? So basically, they want us to pay them 2 times for a smog check which isn't happening because we have decided to take our business elsewhere. PLUS another issue is that NONE of the three employees in a small cramped space were wearing facial masks. This seems to be a problem with this place if you read some of the other reviews below. The owner claims that the issue will be fixed, but obviously they don't care.<//review>

Had some smog issues with my Tacoma, and they took care of it quickly and for a fair price. Staff was friendly and helpful as well. As soon as the issues were diagnosed I got a phone call with a comprehensive description of the problems. Best place in Humboldt county for auto repair<//text>

I trust these guys with my truck, and my wife's car, but I really wish they would actually wear a mask. I've been in a few times over the last year during the pandemic, and I don't think I've seen them wear a mask once</review>

Best quality service I've ever had on any car I've ever owned. Blatantly honest, impeccable work, and by far the best pricing in town on anything from oil changes and smog checks to real work that they give extremely detailed quotes for. Don't bother with anywhere else, Franklin's is what you're looking for.<//Text>

They aren't real mechanics because if your car is older than a 96 they can't hook it up to run diagnostics on it so they won't even look at it. Lazy. They have refused to work on any car I've tried to bring here in the last 7 years that needed more than an oil change and thats been 4 or 5 cars<//review>

These guy told me that my right rear wheel bearing was what was causing my alignment problem, and my uneven tire wear on my Dodge Journey, and I foolishly trusted them, when it was a missing $100 part called a camber bolts that were left off by a previous mechanic. ( we had recently purchased the vehicle, and were having problems aligning the vehicle) long story short, over $600 , and no fix. There are no good mechanics in Humboldt, so it’s not just these guys. I had to have a Southern California mechanic work on the vehicle for it to be fixed properly.</review>< Pictures>

Don't think a mechanics shop has ever treated me like I drive a Ferrari.... Yet it happens today....fit me in on a full schedule....without an appointment....don't think they do it every time. If they can help they will. I have to say thanks for fitting me in...You really saved the day.< /review>

I went in for an oil change, and the tech accidentally broke my radiator. Franklin's not only replaced the radiator free of charge, they also compensated my oil change. On top of all that, Franklin's provided shuttle service to and from my house. Side note: You can also get a milkshake at Toni's while you wait.< /text>

<text>The technicians here are incredibly nice but I have been here several times and have had problems with the quality of their work each time. For a simple tire rotation they cross-threaded my tire bolts from using an impact drill, causing one to break when I had to change my tire for a flat. The second time I went there for a smog check. If you fail, they WILL NOT retest it for free or offer any sort of discount which is not the norm. In the short time I was waiting, I also overheard them saying that they popped another customer's tire while working on their vehicle.... sloppy service. Despite their friendliness and helpful attitude, I would not recommend.< /text>< Rating>

I came in to get a smog and they told me my computer needed to be reset because the battery was recently disconnected and it needed to be driven a few 100 miles... they charged me for the 5 min obd2 scan and refused to let me come back again when it was ready unless i paid a second time... I would recommend going to johnsons in eureka instead of these guys. Johnsons will not charge you if you don’t pass unlike these guys who charged me for a 5 min test.. i spoke with the young guy at franklins with a brown beard and hat who was sitting at the front desk and when i asked his name he said it was none of my damn business. Poor service and rude. Go elsewhere.</text>

We are delighted that we found Franklin's Service when our van broke down on a trip to Humboldt County. PJ (the best "car case manager" around!) and Jason (the owner who stayed late!) went out of their way to assess and fix our problem so we could get back on the road safely and quickly. And they did this despite being booked up for days! These folks deliver the kind of friendly and competent service we all want more of in our lives. They are honest and reasonable and great to work with--what more could you want?! Thank you, guys--you really made a positive difference for us.</text>

Second time at Fanklin’s and I had the same experience. PJ (or AJ... kinda forgot his name) was super kind and profesional. The guys in the shop were super fast and the price for my oil change was super reasonable. Definitely recommend Franklins for anyone looking for a fast and inexpensive oil change and good costumers service.</Review>

We visited Arcata, CA recently (early August) and on the way from Utah for a week long vacation we ran into some A/C problems in 100+ degree heat. With a little 5-month-old we had to make the repair away from home, in a place I had no knowledge of the repair shops and in the time frame we were going to be in town for our vacation (we had two vehicles). After asking around and getting quotes around $2500 to $3500 dollars we found 'Franklin's Service' close to where we were staying. After explaining our situation and setting up an appointment they said they could get it done the next day—and they did! They put a rush on the repair and charged us much less than what others quoted—by thousands!

All I can say is that I am EXTREMELY grateful for their honesty, quality, understanding, pricing, willingness to help, character and ALL the other good words I can put here. Thank You 'Franklin's Service' for your help when we were in a bind!

I absolutely and without question would recommend 'Franklin's Service' for your car repair needs.< /Review>

According to my neighbors, and the mechanic that i use, they are notorious for failing even new cars. My car isnt new, but it passes the next day at a shop in eureka, without the changes that they suggested.<//text>

<review>This Papa John’s location is very hit or miss. It sometimes takes a long time to get mediocre food, and sometimes the mediocre food shows up very quickly, The consistency lies in the quality of the food, which rarely deviates from average.<//review>< Rate>

Great Papa John's!!!  On 2-14 approximately around 530pm I picked up my food. I can not say this enough. I come here all the time and see the same two girls working there hearts out. They put so much pride into there job. I have tried many papa John's pizzas in my lifetime and this one in particular is the best one. These two ladies deserve way more credit. Customer service is amazing and so is the food. Thank you for providing the best pizza ever. Mad Respect.</Text>

I come here for their wonderful pizza.  It's sooo crunchy and delicious.  Have been coming here for years.  The whole pizza tastes great and most of their specialties are awesome.</Text>

I came here to order, but when I saw the gentleman who is making pizza not wearing a mask I changed my mind. It seems they don't care about the health of customers.< /text>

<Text>Pizza was poor and very expensive by UK standards. As we were tourist they added items to push the cost up unbeknownst to us a Garlic dip and a pepperoncine. I ordered a Philly Steak Pizza which had the most miniscule amount of beef possible for $15 (£11) would cost us half that in the UK for a 10" total rip off avoid this particular branch.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>So I came to glendale to take my cosmetology state board exam. One of the most important teats of my life and like an idiot I ordered papa johns pizza. Instead of getting a good nights sleep and waking up well rested, I had diarrhea all night and have had to get up every 2 hours to use the bathroom. Now I have to go to my test and hopefully not have to use the bathroom to much while I am there. I am so disappointed with papa johns right now. If I fail this test papa johns has ruind my life!!!!< /Review><UserId.>115538988906299400713< /UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures><Name>Diedra Anderson</Name><rate>1< /rate><Time>1405424765581< /Time><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great place for many varieties of high quality dog food and cat food. Small selection for any other pet. Good options for grain free and healthy diets.

Most staff is well trained in their inventory.  Nice array of treats, toys, clothes, carriers, etc. For your four-legged family members.

They have cat trees in several styles as well as the usual line up of collars, harnesses and leashes.

Grooming station is on site in the store with good visiblity.

Prices are okay, better when you use the buy three get one free option.< /Review>

< Review>
There was a dog wash  station that was a hoot.  The shampoo was dispensed with the stream of water (like a car wash), then a switch turned off the shampoo so the dog could be rinsed, then the next switch turned on the blower.  The tubs were clean, and the drying station was raised for easy access to the dog.  The dryer was not so noisy so it might scare a dog,  yet the air stream was able to dry down to the skin.  My medium sized dog left fluffy, with soft fur from head to toe.  Nice attendants and people were there to help show me the ropes.<//Review>

They took time explaining the dog food that is good quality.....my dog got sick on a brand of dog food that was bought by another company, and they changed the formula to save money.
They really know their products and they were so helpful ....I do believe they have guided me to a better product for my beloved pet....
You get a lot of personal care..... I highly recommend Pet Food Express< /Text>< UserId.>

I can't stand to see the poor cat's locked behind glass. I try to get what I need and not look,or I'm sad all day. I would feel better if someone was caring about them. When I asked,the employees said they weren't allowed to pet them. They were crying 😭 and I don't know if I can go back</Text>

Pet Food Express is the only local pet shop that carries both the brand of cat litter and the brand/flavors of canned cat food I buy for my cat.  It's very nice to be able to shop for both items in one place.  The staff is very helpful, and the buy 3, get 1 free deal is great, especially when you're buying large bags of cat litter!< /Text>

James was awesome! He helped us so much with finding the right food, pumpkin for our dog's stomach and was super informative with different food products and treats. He spent a lot of time with us and made sure we were pleased. He even played with our dog which made him comfortable as well. Thanks James! He's amazing and really shows the company morale. We are always going to come here now.</Review>

<Text>I think this is the best pet supply place in town. Staff is always super helpful and they have the best selection of good foods and toys for your pets. They also will take back any food or litter that your cat or dog does not care for. No receipt needed if you are exchanging. I go here for all my pet stuff.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Well, I am probably just as guilty as Stanton Optical. I wanted contact lenses and had been there for an eyeglass order, and thought that it was affordable so "why not"? Well, you absolutely get what you pay for. The prescription was completely useless, the team walked away several times mid-service to help someone else, and I had to wait over 2 weeks to receive the sample pair which was supposed to be provided same day among other things. I didn't dare go back because I did not feel confident that they could do the adjustments properly. Ultimately, I went to an optometrist and spent another $300+ to get them fitted properly.< /review>

Great place for glasses.  The entire staff is very professional and helpful.  I went in for replacement lenses and they helped me find the most economical way to get them.  They even gave me a 50% discount since my Rx was still good.<//text>

Terrible experience, out of every eye optometrist center, I've never been so ignored, I wanted to take an eye exam there since i’ve been needing new contacts, so they offered me dailies. I came back to try out monthly’s since the dailies didn't work out for me. I took them home to try them out and I was somewhat satisfied for the price, turns out they never wrote them down! They completely forgot that I tested out monthly’s. We came back to revisit, I recognized the brand that I was using for it, and they agreed to email the prescription to us. Nothing! It feels as if they just put us to the side, persuading us to beg for the prescription in 2 MONTHS! We have visited the experience at least 3 times already, and they make us wait for an hour for absolutely nothing. Me? Someone to actually leave a review on anything? A MIRACLE.

So unprofessional… chances of me coming back can go lower than my school grades.</text>

What stood out to me the most though was how friendly the staff was and how above and beyond they went. I had my 1 year old son with me and they helped comfort him while I got my exam done since he was scared of the machines and crying. Their patience and kindness meant a lot to me. I will definitely be going back to them for any future needs.<//review><user>103599712062587173087< /user>< rate>

I had a decent experience getting glasses at Stanton. Their selection of designer frames was little bit lacking. Price was just ok. I went in there with a prescription for glasses - progressive frames. I knocked off a star because when I went to pick up my glasses, they wouldn't include a cloth to clean them. I realize that this may seem kind of petty, but after paying close to $300 you can't include a 50 cent cloth to clean them? Really dumb because now I will probably go elsewhere next time. There are so many other competitors out there that don't cheap out.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>This place is a joke. I asked for advice on contacts that were similar to the ones I was already using and the lady had no idea what I was talking about. I had to wait 2 weeks for some samples, they called me to come pick them up and they weren’t even there yet so I had to wait another week. The contacts are so terrible they get dry and blurry so I can’t see anything after a few hours. The glasses frames were so heavy they hurt my head and I had to return them. There isn’t even an actual eye doctor in the office, you get an exam over a video screen??? I wasted so much time here. I’m just glad they approved me using the prescription for another brand of contacts. But seriously this place offers no value for anything.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Don't come to this place. It's absolutely obnoxious the price points this place is charging. Ripoff

I appreciate your reply Stanton, but I was not there for the deals. I would recommend others to Glassesusa.com or site similar to these in order to buy a cheap pair comparable to Stanton without the ridiculous price points.

I would also advise anyone interested in purchasing glasses from here to purchase the deals on Livingsocial.com or Groupon.com in order to save yourself a few dollars for these cheap glasses.

I would also recommend to have your prescription double checked after having your test at Stanton. I am not the only person that had an incorrect prescription provided.

Stanton, please take care of your customers. You are doing a mediocre job and in my case and very poor performance by you and your company.

I don't believe any departments you forward this to will remedy or make the necessary changes so price points are fair. Thank you for not helping. Please don't waste your time.</Review>

I have been to the Escondido location 7 times in the last two months. Why? 1st visit was great I got my eye exam and picked out my frames. Alex was very helpful.

2nd visit: two days after I received my glasses they began to crack at the nose. Completely crack and fall apart. I have never had this happen. My frames ALONE were $119! So they were not cheap so there is no excuse for this manufacturing issue. Take them off your shelves.

3rd: Alex helped me again and gave me a new pair and had my lenses placed. He mentioned sometimes if the frames are not heated enough sometimes that can happen then apologized. I was out in just a few minutes.

4th visit: two weeks late after getting a second pair the glasses did the exact same thing!!! This time below each eye the began to crack open around the lenses.

5th: Alex ordered me a new pair of my choice. This I appreciate especially for my time. However I should have been given some replacements of some sort now that ima waiting again another two weeks with glasses the Lenses pop out of everyone they are adjust on my face.

6th: I arrive in the date I was told to come as they should be ready. The were not delivered yet.

7th : I arrive and I was presented with the wrong glasses. Then they find my ray bands. She offers to adjust my frames. I said, “ no that’s okay every time I get that done they are never done correctly and end up being crooked.” She responds are you sure? “No I’m okay I don’t want them done wrong on accident.” She then responds with, “Well they need to be adjusted because they are supposed to sit higher on your face and don’t slip.” I said “okay” and handed them to her. After 3-4 adjustments because they were crooked. She said if she loosens the left side that will relive pressure on the right side. That makes no sense that will just my them crooked and add pressure on the right. At this point the frame was digging into my right ear. I then gave up and said if I have to come back “again” I guess I will have to.

Moral of the story is yes they are clean, yes they can be nice but some not all employees are not educated on how to adjust or properly communicate to customers and some of the frames are trash they should not be falling apart by wearing them. I should not have had to make that many trips to the store.

If you are reading this, save time and money and just go to lens crafters!!!< /Review>

<Review>I had a bad experience the 1st time I worked with Stanton, they put my left prescription in my right lense and vise vera, I went back to them and they reimbursed my money and asked if they could fix it, I was not going to allow them the chance, my vision is important, I couldn't believe they had made a mistake like that. I was done with them but this time around, although I was a bit nervous they had a good deal, cheaper than Lens Crafters and I needed contacts in a short period of time for my best friends wedding so I gave them a try. The young lady that worked with me had a great personality, she was so patient with teaching me how to put in the contacts and it helped me not feel bad about this place anymore, I figured when you make a mistake you try to fix it which they did, and this experience was a great one so I reccomend giving them a try.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1601499395849, 'text': 'Hello Shelby,\n\nThank you so much for your post!

<Review>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THEIR PSEUDO-EYE EXAM.  I was told when I called in that an eye doctor (Dr. White) would be doing my eye exam. (I specifically asked.)  When I got there, that was not the case.  (The young man did apologize for the mis-information).  As was NOT explained over the phone, a skyped "Refractionist" would be determining my prescription. After quite a few "is the first better or the second?" the skyped refractionist says to me "Now we will examine for reading."  (This is what I came in for).  He shows me a page of letters of shrinking fonts.  He asks if the first or second is better.  I can read both, but when pressed I say, "probably the second." OK, great!  We are done with your assessment.  Really?
Well, their prescription says I need the same magnification in both eyes which I know CANNOT be true because I can most definitely read small print more easily from one eye than the other.  I explained this to the next person to help me.  Also, my current reading prescription also has different magnifications on each eye.  The service-person basically concludes, Great! We have the right prescription!  I feel like I just flushed $45 down the toilet!  I now have to pay to get an optometrist to evaluate my vision.  I do not trust their assessment.  Sure, everyone can read if you make the magnification large enough!  Just err on the side of too magnified.   Also, while I was there TWO different customers were sent home because they were over the age of 80 and they were not allowed by law to give them this pseudo-eye exam (without a doctor present).  Neither women had been accurately informed of this.   They should advertise it for what it is and ACCURATELY EXPLAIN what it is that they do and what they are charging for.  Instead they gloss over it and pretend it is a standard eye exam.  Really, it is the equivalent of going to CVS and trying on the reading glasses from the rack until you get the best ones.
It is fine if you buy your eyeglasses here but do not get your eyes examined here.</Review>< pictures>

<review>They told my gramma they would have her perscription and that she could get them that day so we drove 95 miles to this location to get it done. After all was said and done they told us it would be 2 weeks for her to get her glasses, she had retina surgery and would need to get her glasses redone in 2 weeks this is why we made the extensive trip. Gustavo was a terrible listener and just wanted to push us through absolutely terrible cusromer service. I was going to start coming here for my glasses but this experience makes me reconsider using this compan .< /review>< pictures>

Do not come into this place expecting the truth about your  warranty or proper eye exams. They do not dilate your eyes and the Doctor is via video chat.  The Brand Manager Alexander Sanchez was very Confrontational and wasn't even current with curent situations about my warranty and was very manipulative about what was sold to me by an employee Gustavo.
Go to Eye Glass world or anywhere else this man Doesn't Work..

<text>Buyer beware! I was wondering how this place could offer such low prices. Well, for starters, the $59 deal is for people with simple prescriptions who choose from a limited selection of frames. Then, your exam is done via Skype, which was difficult to say the least. 2 weeks of waiting and my glasses were totally wrong. I had to make another appointment, this time with a “live” Dr. My appt was changed once, but I arrived on time only to find out they were behind, and it would be almost a 2 hour wait! After speaking with the manager, who offered me a free pair of sunglasses for my trouble, I got in after an hour. Another 2 week wait; my glasses were better, but only one pair were ready. That means another trip. I can tell this pair needs adjusting, but the tech said they looked fine. Very frustrating trying to reach them by phone- one guy admitted to me they don’t always have time to answer the calls!! I should have stuck with Costco-they’ve never let me down!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>I have been dealing with this company for over 8 months. The last straw came when the Manager promised to be there we made an appointment and we go in she isnt there her employee says there are no notes whatsoever! So I call today and Deanna tells me she had a family emergency and she leaves extensive notes doesnt offer anyway of making it right. So I have decided to contact an Attorney and file a lawsuit against this company. I believe 8 months is enough! By the way her employee tells me if you have been having problems for 8 months why do you keep coming back! He is right im not im going to sue!</Review>< Pics>

<Gmap_id>0x80dbf5be8f895685:0x2f9e01ebe7f353e5< /Gmap_id><review>Me and my mother came in prepared to buy glasses for both me and her. Initially all the staff was welcoming, except for one girl that was receiving all the eye appointment in the back. She was wearing Blue scrubbs, hair looked like she just rolled out out bed, not presentable at all. Her whole demeanor looked as if she was annoyed with the staff and customers and was pretty unprofessional and being vary loud about how she was being bothered on her "break" when asked by one of her co-worker (who greeted us professionally) If she was busy.. She yells across the sales floor she was on her break... mind you while sitting in the sales floor. Blabbering about how she entittled to her break while making sure everyone heard. She was a turn off and we walked out. She need to work on her customer serive skills and personal presentation and not complain about doing her job, or at least do it so that not the whole store can hear. She looked like she didn't want to be there or bothered or questioned even after she "Clocked in" as she told my mother to "wait since she had to clock in and She just came back from lunch" and definitely made it apparent she was annoyed at my mom while asking your employee questions and voicing her concern . Please Hire somene who does want to be there and is equipped with the customer service skills needed to retain customers & help generate money for a profession business like this. Now we're on our way to buy our glasses else where.< /review>< Date>

This place is an unmitigated disaster!. If you care about your eyesight at all stay away. Eye test is done remotely via a tv monitor, no real contact with doctor. Very deceptive web site as well. Glasses in 15 minutes or less, I've been waiting for a month now and still they can't tell me when they will arrive. 2 pair for $59 excludes len's except for the cheapest plastic. and there has to be 2 identical pairs on their shelf.<//Text>

Overall my experience here was ok. The price advertised can be a little misleading but with the eye exam (95.00) and 2 frames (95.00 for the most expensive pair, second one free) my total was 190.00 for 2 pairs of glasses. You do pay for what you get, the frames quality is ver sub-par compared to the Ray-Ban Wayfarers I had before so don't expect the best quality there, but the prescription was very comparable to the one I received at Lens Crafters and the optometrist did a great job. Even though the consultation was done via skype and she was not actually there physically. I did have a a price discrepency at the end which I had to call corporate about but the store manager came around and fixed it in the end. Overall if your looking for value this is probably your best bet.</text>

< Review>
Brandon made this year’s taxes a breeze. I was nervous about filing, so I reached out and I couldn’t be happier with the service, speed, and knowledge that him and his team were able to provide. I plan on doing my taxes with them every year from now on and regret not finding them sooner!< /Review>

last night was our first time in this fine restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We had great time with the excellent service, with the excellent  meal and fine drinks and with the comfortable price. We will definitely visit there in a short time.<//Text>

They have the best pork sisig. I also love their pork barbecue and silver fish. Good Filipino food all around. The staff are fast and friendly. The only downside is their prices, it's a bit expensive for me.< /text>

First time I came here thinking the sisig dish would taste the same as when you order it in trays, but it was VERY salty, the Adobe dish had more onions than meat, and their combo only comes with 3 little scoops of rice. I was very disappointed. I DO NOT recommend it. $8.21 combo was not worth it. Sadly</Text>

Don't be fooled by the outside , very nicely decorate inside . Service was great , the pancit was on the small side but very delicious. I would not recommend the adobo... the sauce was like gravy and it was cold.  The desserts looked delicious.</review>

This place is great if you like pork. I'm not much of a pork eater. I came to try the goat and it's only made Fri and Sat. The food is fresh and tasty but just wish they had more variety besides pork.< /text>

<review>Really feels like you're stepping into a part of the Philippines. A lot of authentic dishes are served and there is quite the variety.  I had the barbecue skewer, the chicken adobo, and a dish called tinola. All the dishes were quite tasty. It may not seem like a big deal, but they have a specific kind of vinegar that I'm sure they mix themselves, but it's so good! Enough spice and saltiness to compliment the dishes. I really liked it on the barbecue skewer. They also have a small selection of desserts, didn't get to try them, but at least you know you have the option.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Thier Fried shrimp with egg or tiny fish is hard to bite. And the old lady the one who place food on the order lessen the meat so watch her flick your ulam back to Thier trays.
Keep a close eyes on her. Rice is not warm.
The rest is ok.</text>

Palabok has shrimp, pork, seafood balls, hard boiled egg.  Not salty but tasty and yummy. Pork menudo was delicious too with big chunks of soft lean meat .  Not sure whether they put liver on it but it passed my standards and my husband's as well, who by the way is very discriminating with taste. Both were not oily since there were not too much fat so we loved it. Turon was USD2.50 per piece which I thought was expensive considering it did not contain langka. Hopefully they start putting it.<//Text>

They only have calding caldereta on Fridays and Saturdays. They are closed on Sundays. If you want some good authentic Filipino food, the best place in the Carson area is Nita's for sure. If you are from San Diego , this type of cooking compares to Titas kitchenette in national City. Love that place too.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Slightly better than your average turo turo(Filipino cafeteria). They serve a lot of the traditional Filipino stews, soups and grilled items. One of my favorites is the dinakdaan it's a creamier your version of the more well known Filipino dish sisig. Save room for desserts because they do most of them really well here like the: Buko pandan.</text>< Pictures>

Best chicken sandwich compaired to others. But the size of chicken legs are skimpy and family deals are expensive. KFC has better offers and bigger legs. Also my opinion. Burger King original Chicken sandwich with cheese and tomatoes which used to be called the American chicken Sandwich is the best. My opinion.< /text>

The spicy fried chicken here is delicious.  There are many kinds of sauces.  , Is a young and energetic work team.  Warm, friendly, and prompt.  I like it very much.<//Review>

<Review>Some days/nights are good, others are problematic. Incorrect orders, overcooked food, overcharged & rude employees. If you ever come across a problem, don't call them... They won't answer regardless of how many times you call. And after waiting in a long line again, they lie to you about why they didn't answer & why your order was incorrect. I've come to the conclusion things have gone downhill here & it starts with Management.<//Review>< userid>

Arrived to the drive through at 9 pm.  They had no chicken and the fryers were broken.  At this point there are other cars behind me so I ordered the fish sandwich, two chicken sandwiches and a tenders meal because "all they had was sandwiches".  Get to the window and told there are no chicken sandwiches! I asked for three chocolate beignets, no go, they only had ONE apple pie.  So, I was left with half an order.  I was so frustrated I left without realizing they didn't give us the drink for the meal!  I highly suggest in the future they send someone out to the drive through to advise customers they have NO Food prior to us piling up in the drive through with no way out.</Review>

<Text>The food was good. However, the chicken sandwiches are premade, which made the mayo hot and in the process of getting crudely. The service wasn't great; they kept cutting me off and not letting me finish my order. They had a rude tone when I asked for a chicken sandwich without mayo. They're just not respectful to the customer.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>After waiting 5 minutes to order I was informed they are once again out of the chicken sandwich. So I order the 5 piece chicken strip combo. Then waited another 5-10 minutes to get to the window (one car in front of us) to pay- almost $15 for one meal. So I get home (literally all the way across town) and sit down to eat to find out they have given me the wrong meal. Something I cannot eat because I don't eat meat on the bone. I ended up having to go to McDonald's (another bummer) to get my dinner. I am so disappointed and dissatisfied in this Popeyes. I have yet to have a decent meal from there, between them always being out of what I want, to them only taking cash (for whatever reason), and now them messing up my meal. I never want to go back.<//text>< rate>

<Review>Went through the drive thru and went to order Shrimp and 1 wing.

We were told they had no bone in chicken and it would be atleast an hour..... an hour? They are a chicken place?

Pulled up to the window and saw 5 employees standing around talking, including the manager.

When we asked why it would take an hour the manager said because they were slammed. When we asked how long it took to fry some chicken she told us to “have a great night”

We then asked for her name and she covered her badge and walked away..... wow obviously they don’t care about providing customer service nor do they know how to manage a rush hour shift.

Your employees are only as great as your manager.

This Popeyes definitely needs to look into who they have managing their rush hour shift!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Absolutely awful service. Ordered 20-25 minutes ahead of time with the mobile app for drive-thru pickup. After speaking to the order box, I went to the window and was told to pull up to the front of the building because the order wasn't ready yet. Waited 15 minutes there and nobody brought the food out. Went to the door (locked since the lobby is closed) and knocked several times but nobody responded or even looked up even though one employee was sitting at a table presumably on a break. Had to wait through an additional 30 minutes in the drive thru line again to get my food. Was told by another employee that I should have pulled up to the window instead of the front of the building?! Oh, and once I got my food, my receipt clearly had the description of my vehicle written at the top but nobody could've brought out my food after telling me to wait at the front? Never coming back again.< /text>

My coworker and I used to get the chicken sandwich meal every Friday for lunch until one Friday we both got really sick after eating our chicken sandwich meals.
I havent had popeyes since. Food safety is important and often overlooked.
I went from a frequent customer to never planning to return again.</Review>

<review>This Popeyes has very bad customer service. Please please throw the whole Popeyes away. They need to go through and just pick out half of the staff who works here because any body that stays in Vacaville knows that this Popeyes is the worst. Customer service is at a all time low here. Every time I go they are disrespectful and rude. The whole establishment is just really bad all around honestly.</review>< pics>

<Review>Do not even bother with their delivery services.  Ordered a family meal around 5:15pm and it says it'll take about 31 minutes. Checked the status of order around 6:30pm, app says it's being picked up by driver (John R.) with a telephone number (that is not in service).  6:50pm, order says it's in route (but without any estimates given).  6:55pm, the order on the App disappears without a trace or evidence of the order. Tried calling the establishment and nobody picks up. It's my first time ordering using their app.  It will also be the last time using their app or their business with this kind of service.  Very disappointed in them.  They have minors running the facility or something.</Review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Worst Popeyes! Yall have to get it together! I was waiting on my order and I heard the manager(blue shirt) say "5 minutes for chicken sandwich no pickles, unless your just going to take the pickles off, do you want to just take the pickles off?" My problem with that is allergies.  If someone is allergic and the pickle juice is still on the chicken sandwich that causes for an allergic reaction.  This is terrible management! Then I see an employee with gloves on go take a meal to a car come back inside then head right back into the kitchen while never changing gloves. It is a crucial time in America where covid is real. Be safe out there everyone. Popeyes, get it together. The pre-cooked pre made pre wrapped chicken sandwiches aren't good either. They get soggy in that bag!<//review><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

Bad enough to happen once but unfortunately the only consistent thing about this restaurant is their terrible customer service and inability to accurately and timely provide food.<//review>< pictures>

I came here back in March and the food was normal as it always is but one of the employees made my experience top notch. She told me I looked really cool and that I was beautiful. Wish I caught her name. She was young like a teen and I think she had blonde hair. She was also really cool and beautiful. Hopefully she sees this one day <3<//Review>

<text>First moving to Vacaville i had a few issues with this place 1st time we waited forever to get our order but im sure that's what happens when you hire kids and a manager that let his crew tell him what to do.. Alot of orders were being deleted from the board because rhe young crew was overwhelmed and moving in slow motion.

2nd did a online order got there and was told they never got the order but the money had already been took from my account and i would have to call corporate to get the refund.
3rd time is similar to the 2nd time was told i can pull in front amd they would curbside got there was confronted by some lady claiming to be the manager saying they don't offer curbside pick up amd i have to go through the drive thru amd i refused because the line was all the way to the busy street again had to get a refund from corporate and come to find out the 3rd time i was charged twice.
But now i believe it's under new management ( i hope ) because it flows smooth and fast now without a screwup.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>The only way that you can purchase an item is to go through the drive-through this establishment. But mind you please enter this drive through with a lot of time to spare. I guarantee you you will not be out of that drive-thru line in under 30 minutes. Yes I am sad to admit that every time I visit this establishment the wait to get to the window is over 30 minutes. Customer service is not something that you will find at this establishment so please do not go there looking for some. This place has a lot of work to do at least the food comes out correctly that's the best thing I can say< /review><Rating>1</Rating><gmap_id>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Awful service! If I could rate this zero stars I would! Lady at the drive thru tried telling me they didn’t have blackened chicken even though my husband who was in the vehicle in front of me just made that exact order!? Completely disrespectful and unnecessarily rude to me. I will not be going to this establishment again.<//Review>

<Review>This location was very busy at the dinner rush. It took close to 30-45 minutes for us to get our dinner here. We just ordered 3 single serve combos. There was also no ice in the soda machine. There wasn't that many utensils left & we couldn't find ketchup for my fries. The food was good & cashier was nice though.</Review>< pictures>

<text>The manager on duty was incredibly rude. Didn't even give me a chance to ask for sauces. Cut me off several times. No napkins. No cutlery for the sides. The chicken, if you want to call it that, seemed like it was 2 days old and seemed like they fryed pure batter. Won't ever return to this location again.</text>< Pictures>

I dont know how a place that MAINLY sells chicken...can tell a customer there will be a 30 minute wait for chicken...not sure they know how to do their jobs at that point. Although I know it wont matter and nobody will get in trouble so this is more for anyone who goes there. Be prepared to be told they dont have the only things on their menu.<//Text>

< Review>
I’ve been here twice and both times I’ve sat in line for 30 minutes or more . I ordered chicken sandwiches and they said I was a 20 minute wait for it I said ok that’s fine. Butttt I didn’t know they would have people wait in the line for the 20 minutes. I think it’s better if the customers pull around and park and the staff bring the food out when it’s done. Also there’s a lot of standing around of them doing nothing.</Review>

Worst ever service they started laughing at my name
And her name Is Lily and they should teach them to not laugh about people’s names, they were super mean when we were ordering our food and it was our first time going there and I’m disappointed, and the manager should teach them what respect is< /review>

The customer service was awful. I expected a long wait, but I wish I would've never visited and don't plan to ever return. It would have been nice if the place was adequately staffed. Also would be nice for the staff to acknowledge the long wait and to inform all customers they made a decision to stop taking orders for 20 minutes so staff could "catch up". The food was good, but you can't treat customers that way. Staff needs customer service training.<//Text>

<review>Had the spicy chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. Fries were so so. Wait was understandable because it was the beginning of the lunch rush and the drive thru line was long. The kitchen looked decent but the huge  problem was the dining room. It was a pig sty. Literally disgusting. The tables were filthy and regardless of where you walked the floor was sticky. There was no ice in the machine. No lids for the drinks. No napkins. Nobody made an effort to clean anything in the dining room and for that reason alone I won't be going back.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The service was terrible! I went through the drive through...ordered and paid for my food then I was directed to wait out front for 3 to 5 minutes so they could cook me fresh chicken tenders but after waiting 15 minutes I had to walk inside just to see employee's playing around as I hear them talking about my order but still not making it!! I had to get loud with the employee's after waiting another 15 minutes inside just so they would make my order!! An to top it off it was 14$ for a 5 piece chicken strip meal that only came with s handful of COLD fries!!<//review>

Ordered a 3 piece and a 4piece,  on the 3 piece I got 2 wings and on the 4 piece I got 3 wings. I dropped my cellphone in the store  and when I got home called them and they said no one turned one in but I got pings from the tracker in the store till past 9 PM. The next day I got another ping and then the next ping I  got was across the street. I never found the phone.</text>

This is normally my go to Popeye's in Solano County but this time we were told we'd have to wait for chicken strips and for apple pie. They told us 7mins. After sitting out front for 20mins I went in to find out what was the hold up. They all acted like they had no clue then 1 girl says nobody told her the pie was done. ALL the food was cold< /review>

<Text>Usually really good but my visit tonight, we got cold hard fries 1/8 pound of shrimp when we ordered 1/4 pound (we weighed it because it looked small) And got the wrong drink given to us. The employee watched me take a sip and asked for it back and put it on the counter like she was gonna give it to the next car. And my dads "chicken strips" are more nugget sized. (Picture attached) All this after waiting for like 20 minutes after paying for the food. Sending this review to the restaurant as well.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnnaZ0IZNnQ-z7s5iWGKAZEZ7zc2pm0robRsBc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

First their system doesn't want to process a perfectly good card. I return with cash letting them know before hand that I will get cash and to have my order ready please. I have to wait in line twice and when it's my time again turns out the order wasn't made. Why not help out the situation by at least keeping the order ready. They didn't get my money today don't know when they will again<//review>

Dry. They are now charging 20 cents for condiments. They have went up in price recently. $24 for a #6 and a #7... Manager was trying her best to be on top of things, but I saw a few people walk out.  I feel maybe new management has taken over and have no idea on how to run a business. I will not come back. Sorry!</text>< Name>

<Review>So the customer service here is horrible. I waited over 30 minutes to buy a gift card for someone but after waiting found out they dont do giftcards. I would never have waited normally but it was a special gift. The place was vastly understaffed but seem to have the volume during the pandemic to support more staff. I cant comment on the food quality as I never ordered any and based upon my visit I never will.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Food was good, place looked clean. I just didn't like that I ordered a 2 piece meal, and luckily I checked before I left, because the heavy set girl, think she was the manager...had put just two tiny wings in the box. I brought it to her attention and she did add a breast. Had I wanted two wings I would have bought two at like $1.78 each. But I was paying over $8.00... I am unsure as to if it was done on purpose or if it was a genuine mistake. The rice and beans I took as my side dish, I had to dump it because it smelled funky, like it was left over from the day before and was not refrigerated properly, it even looked funky.  The biscuits were nice and warm and tasty.</Review></record>

I spent 51 dollars on chicken in the drive through just to get home and see that my tenders were not put in the bag. I called the place a few times and Answering service says it’s full and to hang up.<//review>

<Text>Tried the sandwich everyone's been talking about and it was very good. The line inside and outside was outrageous so I do believe they could work on being  efficient with their service in that regard. We opted to eat inside thinking it may be quicker but it did take about 30 mins to finally order. Chicken tenders didnt have taste and the shrimp was delicious as usual. Family tried mac and cheese for first time and enjoyed it. Overall decent experience due to most food ordered but the waste of time and other meals purchased gives them an okay rating overall.<//Text>< Pictures>

We arrived at 7:32 (according to my timeline) and we stood in line inside for no less than 21 minutes before an order (which was massive) even left the kitchen. I’m assuming most people waiting inside were delivery drivers for DoorDash or GrubHub (based on the conversations I overheard) and these people would’ve had to wait to fulfill their orders anyway, but I was appalled that none of the employees acknowledged the wait at all for anyone in the lobby. A simple “sorry, for the wait everyone, it’ll be a few minutes,” or even “we have a few large orders, sorry it’s taking us a bit to get everything ready,” but there was nothing! Employees who walked past us to clean the floor and the restrooms avoided eye contact. The other customers and I kept looking at each other in disbelief of the situation. I finally followed suit of some other customers and abandoned ship. I don’t think I’ll be back this location ever again. The so-called best chicken sandwiches in the world aren’t worth experiencing that again.<//text>

<review>Bring your own sauce and order 1 hour early. We decided to have dinner and we repented. We had to wait 55 minutes for chicken order and when we asked for sauce, we are told, sorry pay $0.20 for each packet. For 24 piece of chicken gave 4 packets total.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This used to be a good store but tonight was horrible. They were out of stock on a bunch of things we agreed for. When we finally found food and drinks that they had and we wanted then we get home only to find out they left food out and got orders wrong. Also the food want fresh. The Cajun fries were old and cold. The staff were kinda of rude talked rudely about the company too.</Text>

DO NOT go inside to order unless you just have time to waste,  drive through is faster, because the inside staff is extremely inefficient. The food is pretty good, I mean they are the only fried chicken place around so no competition.< /Text>

<Text>Poor service, cold food, served with a big side attitude. Manager in charge when I visited had one of those kind of attitudes where u order and she is all teeth clenched "yes ma'am", super tension induced interaction mixed with negative vibes all the way. She got half my food ready, and stopped, (assuming the busy team would handle the rest, I guess) and then went on talking ish about customers wanting dipping sauce. Which she ended up just GIVING THEM after all of her drama. Yet, easily charged me 2 seconds after... Not that I mind paying for it. Its just the principle of the matter.<//Text>< response>

<Text>Well, it's no Roscoe's. But it's better then KFC.
Really tho, it was pretty tasty fried chicken, so I can't criticize much.

What do Popeyes and me have in common?

Read online that Popeyes had the best chicken sandwich of all chains. I went yesterday and was told they were out of pickles. That can happen, so I left. Today I ordered a chicken sandwich with extra pickles. After 30mins... received chicken sandwich...no extra pickles? Not 'Impressed'!</review>

< review>
Waited 15 minutes, behind two men who had been waiting even longer and none of us were greeted or got service.  I think they were going through some personal drama. 12 minutes in, the manager apologized, but gave no explanation and no one (including her) stepped up to serve us.  After several more minutes, I bailed and so did several others in line.  Bad, bad, bad.<//review>

Waited in the drive thru today for a chicken sandwich meal with a Medium diet coke. The cashier repeated my order and mistakenly said regular coke. I corrected her twice that is needs to be a diet coke. I get to the window expecting what I ordered, and ended up with a regular coke with cold fries and a chicken sandwich that was poorly put together. This place really needs to step up their customer service big time.< /Review>

That had to be the worst experience ever in a fast food restaurant. 3 people working behind the counter,  at least 8 people in line.  Waited 15 min to have my order taken.  Then almost 30 min later, they never drop the fish in the fryer.  Finally get my food and I'm told the didn't have any tartar sauce.  Told the lady, if it wasn't so busy I would demand my money back.  Everyone in the restaurant was complaining  to each other.   I should know better, this location has always had really slow service.  Always under manned. Probably be quite a while until I return!</text>

<review>I just stood in line for 30 minutes so my family to try this chicken sandwich. Then I was rudely told but I'm only allowed 2 sandwiches.. I got 6 to feed. Both as a cashier and manager were extremely rude. I asked why they didn't notify everybody in line that there is a limit. I realized there's a lot of people wanting these sandwiches. But this has been going on for WEEKS there's no reason that people are standing in line for that long and not being notified  that there's NEW RULES a as to ensure that you're not wasting customer time. There should be a big sign out front that says only two sandwiches per order. Both the cashier and the manager were extremely rude about the situation. Not to mention the staff behind the counter were extremely slow. Putting around and had absolutely no concern that there was a huge line. Not to mention they have the drive-thru closed. And just closed it by putting a car in the drive thru so everybody's pulling in thinking it's a line. The manager clearly has no business managing anything to do with customer service..< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Their new Spicy chicken sandwich was delish, just enough heat to satisfy. The chicken patty was big, too. One was plenty. And it is cheaper than Chick-fil-A, too.</Text>

<Review>Got there at opening to try the chicken sandwich that has been in news all week bcuz it's so popular. Waited at drivethru for 15+ minutes and only 3 cars ordered and moved forward and there was still 5 cars between myself and order speaker. I decided I would go inside and stand in line instead. There were 8 people in line ahead of me and 4 people off to side that were waiting for their order. There were a number of employees working behind counter, including a manager. After 15 minutes in this line, only 3 people had placed their order and they all were for 1 to 3 chicken sandwiches, so I left after deciding that I could not afford to waste as much time in line as it seemed it was going to take. My question is this: if you know that you have a sandwich that is so popular that you are getting nationwide media attention over it, wouldnt you make at least a small batch of them before you open and have them ready? I dont understand how you need 5+ minutes per customer to take each order. Incidentally, each person's order that I saw filled, inside and in drivethru (which i could see through window while i was inside) was only one bag.< /Review>< user_id>

This place surprised the heck outta me!  It was chosen by my date, who lives in San Jose.  They have everything you need for a good night out all in one spot!  Good drinks, good food, good ppl and good music!  Must go again.  They also have an outdoor space and you can watch the games there as well.</text>

LOVE their food! And their $5 daily specials are just the right size to fill you up. This location was severely understaffed to the point that it looked like the employees were having to choose between filling orders quickly (which they weren't, even though the employees were clearly scrambling to fill them) and cleaning tables/maintaining the place. Because of this, they were out of lids at the drink area (which wasn't filled even after we told them within the 45 minutes or so we were there) and there was a huge package of napkins on the front counter that guests were expected to help themselves to. No tables were cleaned during our visit, even though they were used many times.

Despite all this, over all the appearance of the restaurant was good compared to many fast food places in the area.</review>

<gmapID>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20<//gmapID><Review>I was maybe one of the last drive through customers for the night. I ordered my food, staff prepared it, and the person who appeared to look like the shift manager brought my food to the window and turned around to do something else. As I waited for another 5 mins, the person who appeared to be the shift mgr told the person who took my order to give me my food.
I don't understand why she couldn't have just open the dang window and gave it to me?!?!
Other then that, we still enjoyed our meal.

<review>I rarely review, if ever. While the employees were pleasant and cordial, the service was very slow, but this was not the real issue at hand. The real issue was the food. It was not good. Actually quite awful. I don't plan to ever eat at a Popeyes again.<//review><userid>100595347970367817184</userid><Date>1545541826048</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's a Popeye's.  Four starts instead of five because they were out of spicy thighs.  But really, it's fast food, I don't expect perfection.  If you like Popeye's, I recommend this one as much as any other.<//text>

<text>I'm very disappointed in this particular Popeyes. The service at this place is terrible. They are very slow and the chicken is not being served to the standards that I know Popeyes to be. I was born and raised in NOLA and am very familiar with the brand. You take your chances going through the drive thru. I don't know if it's because they're understaffed or not. I was in there the other day and the only one waiting to order. The staff (and someone who appeared to be the mgr) just looked at me as they put other orders together for drive thru and perhaps others. I didn't get a, "We'll be right with you sir," or nothing. One who seemed to be a cashier just looked at me and didn't say a word. After approx 10 min I just left. Maybe because they don't have a financial stake in the business they don't care about customer service. If I buy the place, I'll start off with a whole new crew.</text><Response>None< /Response><Time>1545509432143</Time>< Pics>

They are far and in between where I live. I always enjoy the food but service sometimes suffers. Last time I was there I was waited on and was the only customer. After 20 minutes of no food I went up to the counter, and they forgot my order. It was annoying because the food is already made.<//Text>

<Review>I was really disappointed with my experience. I waited 17 minutes for my meal and got nipped on chicken size. My boyfriend waited even longer and after 19 mins they told us they ran out of fries. And his favorite dipping sauces. It would have been nice to know earlier. But the chicken is still great!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>OK, I've got a Jones for Popeye's spicy chicken. I used to like their catfish, but they took it off the menu years ago. Biscuits and fries are very good too. But don't tell my cardiologist.  I stop here for lunch when I'm driving by, which is once or twice a year. I'd be dead if I did it more often.</Review>< Response>

SO VERY SLOW! I legitimately spent 32 minutes in the drive-thru. I would have left if I weren't blocked in by other cars. But the food is typically fresh so that's a plus.< /Text>

Popular fastfood but workers can be overwelmed, needs a few more employees during peak hours. And needs a bit more cleaning in the restrooms and eating area...which having more employees might be helpful to get duties accomplished.< /review>

<Review>I love Popeye's, but the service at this place was terrible. All the employees looked like they didn't want to be there. I tried to order a special they were supposed to be having, but the cashier said it didn't exist anymore (even though it was posted on the window), and she didn't even apologize for the inconvenience or anything. None of the employees smiled and when I asked for condiments, they threw them at me across the counter. The tables weren't even clean and they even messed up my friend's order. It was just a flat out disappointing experience.</Review>< Pictures>

What kind of primary chicken fast food place. Runs out or chicken sandwiches at 530pm. After waiting in the drive through I was told they would have chicken sandwiches for several hours.  Bad management and planning.  Ended up driving down the street to Chick-fil-A,  they never run out of sandwiches.</Review>

<text>I left without food after 20 minutes in drive thru with only 2 people ahead of me. Why, the spicy chicken strips me and car #1 ordered not ready. 1) you should have said that (I only found out by honking and finally someone came out) and I would've just ordered plain!!! 2) how fricking long does it take to make chicken tenders? After 20 minutes when I left no one had received their food! 3) I would expect Popeyes - A CHICKEN FAST FOOD PLACE would have their most popular menu item attainable at 2:30pm on a Saturday. *SERIOUS INCOMPETENCE*</text>< Pics>

Waited 15 min in line only to find out what I ordered is unavailable (Drive thru window). So I went with the second best option out of hunger, they were out of that too. All I got was a sorry and a third option that I would've needed to pay the difference on. Don't go here. They don't sell chicken.</Text>

They have a worker named “Maddy” and she was an absolute pleasure! She let me take my time to order without any attitude and catered to my needs (i always have a hard time to ordering food for some odd reason its like every thought slips my mind). Nicest worker ive ever met anywhere i swear. I’ll definitely go back. Plus my food was hot not old at all. If i could give 10 stars i would. Thank you Maddy!< /review>

Came here due to the fact that all Vacaville food spots next to the outlets experienced a power outage. Came in and was immediately impressed by Andrea & skyla, very helpful and respectful. Will come back for these type of experiences.</Text>

I've never in my life had to wait 45 mins for 12 pieces of chicken. My grandmother and I watched 34 people get there food before us. Customers in and out. But we had to wait...<//Review>

<review>Went through the drive thru last night and got piss poor service. I ordered the $10 meal they told me they only had spicy chicken and I would have to wait ten minutes. I pulled around and waited. The girl that took the order was high as a kite was the same young lady that brought my order it to me. The order was wrong and she brought out three thighs three drumsticks and a wing (Spicy). I ordered a 5 piece meal  (mild) not 7 piece spicy. Ask for the manager to come out and talk with me, she came out with a wing and biscuit and said she gave you more than what you ask for and put her hands all over the chicken!!! Then went back in and got me a breast. Not knowing that the chicken in the first box was Spicy till I got home after waiting ten minutes for them to cook the mild ones, very disappointed. Called the manager there next day and all she said was what's your address and I'll send you a card to use the next time I come in. I want my 💰 back and I won't ever eat at this establishment again<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20</gmap_id></record>

Chicken and seafood we're all overcooked. Really not happy and won't return. It was not a standard order either which would lend to more attention and paid more for certain pieces...

<text>Got to drive thru at 10:20pm 7/9/17 and was not served. Even though I saw customers inside and employees standing around. If you guys close earlier then change your hours. It saids you close at 10:30pm All I wanted was a side of fries. Not like that would have taken long to make if not already made.  Extremely dissatisfied. Drove across town for nothing.</text>< UserId.>

Long wait in line & from the 12 piece I ordered only 11 was in box & 2 pieces were only 1-2 bites.  Very disappointed.  Always check the food before leaving.  Lesson learned.<//Review>

Every time we go through the drive thru my order is wrong. It's pointless to try. We ordered12 pc tenders and came home wirh legs, thighs and breast last time. Very annoying and a waste of time.< /text>

<text>I like their food, but service can take awhile, at least at this location. I usually leave if there's more than a couple of people ahead of me because of it, but even when it's not busy, it can be a wait. Waited 12 minutes (looked at order time on receipt) today for chicken tenders.<//text>< pics>

Worst customer service I've experienced on drive through, she told me to wait I waited literally 8 minutes with other customers behind me waiting I pulled ahead I no longer wanted their service the car behind me did the same thing, it was only one car in front of us it was all bad still waited 8 extra minutes, that drive through service is bad and don't recommend it..< /Text>

Went through drive thru. Ordered 4 things but was asked to pull around because the biscuits weren't ready. After waiting, food was brought out. No drink that was ordered. No butter for the biscuits. No plastic spoons or forks. No receipt. I don't see even one star's worth of review.</review>
