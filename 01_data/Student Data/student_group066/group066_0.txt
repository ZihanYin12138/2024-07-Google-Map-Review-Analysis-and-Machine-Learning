All-in-all a wonderful meal. The lobster rigatoni was fantastic, and the limoncello cake was amazing. We played it safe with the other dish we ordered, and the lasagna was very good, but I don't think I would order it again next time. The service was fantastic, and they gave us a nice discount on our bottle of wine. The outdoor eating area leaves a little to be desired, but this family-owned business is doing the best that they can with the space that they have.<//Text>

Good restaurant with some serious flaws.  The best part is the bread.  It's prepared and yeast raised the day before, and baked as you sit down at the table, served with oil and vinegar and topped with rosemary.  Superb.  Entrees are reasonably priced.  The bad part is that although some dishes are excellent, some are equally as bad. Look at the picture of the charcuterie board. It looks wonderful. The salami is nice.  Wonderful olives.  It could have used honeycomb, but it was relatively inexpensive so that's okay. I was very impressed. And then look at the picture of the salad but I ordered. Nice dressing, but other than that very plain.  Three quarters of one strawberry and a fat slice of roma tomato with a little Gorgonzola. Very boring. The special that we ordered, a chicken penne, was very dry, needed salt, and boring. Chicken was so hard that it would have bounced. We sent it back and got some alfredo which was fine. My lobster ravioli was pretty good, and made the most of the seafood flavors. The bottom line is that either the food is a hit, or it's a miss, but it's okay because the price isn't unreasonable. Most of the bottles of wine are under $40 which is refreshing to see. Staff is nice.   It's a family run business.  The prices are good. Decor of nice.  Romantic. But some of the dishes are big duds.  I've been here twice and won't come back.< /Text>

Nonno’s you won a forever customer today! The aroma and freshness of the Caesar salad marked with crunchy herbed croutons was more than enough to fill my hunger. The cheese bread was a complete surprise with the crispy crust and perfect balance of seasoning to cheese, to dough balance. The only thing better than their top quality ingredients was their customer service. Lisa was more than accommodating to correct a mis order and her sweetness and genuineness are rarely found. Thank you to the chef and all who put in the work to make Nonno’s food excellent and memorable in a time when others cut corners.</review>

Husband and I went for an early dinner. Lisa was gracious and quick to serve us. She greeted other patrons by name when they entered. We got a glass of red wine each—the Pinot noir and Merlot were both delicious. The chicken parmigiana looked really good and cheesy. The Spicy Shrimp Roma was divine—shrimp cooked just right, vodka like sauce was spicy and flavorful, the pasta was a black linguine and so delicious.  Complementary garlic bread is fresh and garlicky.

Nonno’s is clean and precious. We will be back.< /review>

<Text>Are you tired of homogenized American Italian Restaurant food?  Then get yourself to Nonno's (we came all the way from Ohio, twice). The food here is genuine Old World Italian cooking...just like my grandmother's.  If you live anywhere in the San Diego area, this is a dinning experience you shouldn't  miss...Great service and Fabulous  Food!<//Text><Date>1582762364389<//Date>< user>

<review>There was only 1 waitress in this small maybe 12 table Restaurant. She was extremely on it. She was able to suggest a good wine for my sister in law, she took all 4 of our orders without writing a thing down, and we had substitutions. She kept our yummy garlic bread basket full because that's all my 6 year old would eat. Our dishes came out quickly and were very delicious. This place was awesome. Everyone enjoyed their food.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Nonno's offers a comfortable, casual and slightly upscale dine-in feel. Fancy wine chillers and old world art/pictures fill the walls. The food is fairly priced and quite good. The pizza is very good with a crust that is neither New York thin nor Chicago thick. Pizza toppings are not miniscule shavings, but rather generous chunks of meat or vegetables that are flavorful. Whether dining in or taking out, this is a great place. Our family has been coming here for years as one of our "go to" take-out pizza places.< /text>

The attention to sauces,  which reflected long preparation time and careful selection of ingredients, and the delectable pasta combined to result in an extraordinary meal.

Nonno's is the go-to place for authentic Italian food in San Diego county.</review><gmapID>0x80d9571c919bb17f:0xe9a4cac4270be1c1</gmapID><user>108567145919193445494<//user>< resp>

Nonno's Restaurante is the best Italian restaurant in La Mesa. The chef brings a flair to the food that is unmatched by any. It is small, intimate and about the food. Wine list is like no other with a variety not common for this area. New wines and new food all the time.  Make reservations because they are ALWAYS busy. Lunch or dinner you can not go wrong.<//text>

The owner and his wife cook and serve. Don't let the fact that it's tucked into a little strip mall stop you. After we moved to Palm Springs we still drive back here just to have the fabulous pizza,pasta. I haven't found any place in Palm Springs and environs to compare with Nonno's. . Everything is prepared fresh daily from family recipes.Charming and quiet , it is a treasure. Do yourself a favor and go...you won't be disappointed. The sauce is unbelievable.</Review>< Pics>

My wife and I wanted to try something different. We were told the pizzas were made with all fresh ingredients and are the best in town...boy, we were NOT disappointed!!!

This place is amazing. Food is top notch, service is usually quite fast and personalized. Owner is the chef and usually the server too. Anything and everything you order is going to be delicious. Generous portions and very good prices.</Review>

<Review>My brother and fiancee was looking for an Italian restaurant to take my mom to after a grueling day seeing my dad in the hospital.  What a treat!  They absolutely LOVED the food!  So fresh and delicious!!!!  And they were treated like VIP customers!  Thank you, Nonno's!< /Review>< pictures>

But it's size doesn't reflect the quality of the food.  Anyone looking for a hidden gem would do well to check out Nonno's.  And if you don't feel like dining out, call for take home dinner.  We saw at least a dozen people pick up their orders while there.  An added plus is the friendly, helpful staff.  We'll be going back often.<//review>< rating>

The pizza was delicious. Everything was fresh and tasted great. The kids loved the cheesey bread and the service was friendly and attentive. My glass was never empty and I when I left my stomach was full. We'll definitely be back. It wasn't cheap but great food rarely is.< /Text>

My friend and I had heard about this place from one of our friend's who is from the area, so we decided to give it a try. I am typically really peculiar with my food and this place was great!  The food is worth the price for the quality of the ingredients and the portion sizes are great. I always take food back and eat it later on during the week. I highly suggest trying this place out if your in the mood for good Italian food.</Review>

<resp>None<//resp><rating>2</rating><text>I placed an order for delivery on Amazon Restaurants. "Cheesy Garlic Bread" was more like a thick pizza crust with a layer of cheese. Spaghetti was mushy, and the sauce was tasteless. A $17 order of eggplant parmesan contained a small amount of mushy and tasteless eggplant and a large amount of equally mushy and tasteless spaghetti. Truly one of the worst Italian meals we've had in a long time.< /text>< gmapID>

This is a lovely little hole in the wall that is low-key and delicious as hell. The owners appear to operate this joint and I love them for that. Got a great wine suggestion and everything was amazing. Capers in the Caprese?!?! I'm SOLD.< /Text>

<Review>I was in town for one night with my 5 year old man when I found this place, food is awesome, service is great everyone is very friendly. They feed you bread as soon as you come in ;-) right price. This is the kind of place that makes you feel right at home!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Nice cozy place with amazing food. Nancy welcomed us with an assuring smile and listened to our order very carefully since we ordered vegetarian. She agreed to all of our alterations and additions with an intention to serve us and deliver tasty and quality food. Everything starting from garlic bread, bruschetta, gluten-free pasta, ravioli, lasagna, potato gnocchi was soo tasty and up to the mark. We ended our dinner with desserts which was mango moose, chocolate tiramisu and Oreo cheesecake, which we loved the most. Fully recommend for the people who run it and the tasty food they make.<//review>

<review>I came back on the google reviews of Nonno's to verify if I had said anything already about them.
Because I had been clearing through personal papers in my home.
Finding notes of 2011, about an incorrectly made Nonno's $12.05 pizza transaction. As I still have the Nonno's menu from then. What be different of this/past review vs the '16" meatball sandwich + 8" pastrami sandwich' review:    is that THIS 1-STAR review be for a timeline when menued sandwiches that not listed cheese as an ingredient. Were told to my questioning "All sandwiches have cheese."
As there are those customer who not prefer cheese on sandwiches; or maybe at that one time.

When I said, in slang, of "Every cold sandwich has to have cheese.~"   (my wanting to hear an answer that those who not want cheese can have replaced veggies.) Rather, I got what I expected from such a place:  "Okay." His way of understanding that the menu shows that ALL descriptions have cheese included. He would not speak further.< /review>< pictures>

This place was amazing. Nice little restraunt with only a handful of tables. You may have to make a reservation on the weekends, it was full by time we left. The pizza was really good and the lasagna had the best sauce weve ever had. The bread they give you soaks it right up. I wouldnt recommend bringing small children like we did since its so small and quite. The food took some time but what it lacked it speed the waitress made up in service. She was really nice, friendly and made the dinner more personable by doing little things. One thing we liked was she said "dinners almost ready" instead of the usual foods almost ready, it made it feel like we were at home. They sell their sauces, which we got a small sample to take home. We will definetly be returning minus the children. Perfect for a date night.</review>

<text>* 16" Meatball Sandwich
*  8" Pastrami Sandwich;

Sauce of the Meatball Sandwich was not as strong in taste, as I had hoped. As this was my 1st time of such sandwich @ Nonnos. Temp of sandwich was HOT!
Roll/Bread was toasted a bit overdone, compared to the average Italian eatery. Perfect for me. Toasted in which to be crispy.
I wished the sauce being more heavy; as I have had sandwiches with heavier sauce, than 'pizza' weight sauce.

Pastrami Sandwich had vinegar taste applied, as it should have had; not over nor underapplied.
Actually, the Pastrami was BETTER than the Meatball Sandwich (no sic).
But the Pastrami MEAT was the type that be of the weaker taste. As there is not just 1 'Pastrami' in existence. (without my asking) I was hoping the specific meat that I desire being the one that Nonno's had. But I was wrong.
~I later heard, upon my visiting, that another one has it.~

GREAT customer service, @ counter, as this was a walk-in. (but I told them in advance that my order was gonna be a critique anyway. But that I really came to them for the specific 16" sandwich of Nonnos.)</text>< Pics>

We both had green lip muscles as an appetizer it was wonderful the sauce was delicious.

Then Geraldo served us a Bleu Cheese Strawberry salad with raspberry vinagrette dressing.
.
For a main course I had a delectable chicken picatta.  My wife had the chicken fradiadlo.  We both loved our meals.

Then Geraldo insisted that we have his Trimisu for dessert.  I have had Trimisu at many Italian restaurants but this was best I ever had.  Even beat the Trimisu I had in Venice and Milan.<//Text></record>

We eat here at least once a week for lunch. Gerardo not only offers great service, the food is always spot on.

Please note that I am very hard to please.</review>

Overall a great vibe. Bonus: you can order a pizza before they close and bring it to the bar in the same strip mall.

<Text>My first day here.. Nice and soft place to work... Forget bad reviews... Love work here in overhill farms..

***Update***... Is the worst place to work... Full of bipolar people,.. They think they own the company and wanna treat you like if you were less just for being by agency... Ridiculous people... And the QC department is the worst... SIRA is a witch... 0 stars...< /Text>< gmapID>

<text>The facility is currently infected with people who have the corona 19 virus. I’ve been told by many workers there that no one has reported the issue. Many of the workers are falling Ill due to the company not managing the health of all worker and these workers have no other choice but to work for their families. The workers are put in lines stuck together. It is not a sanitary work space for a person to even work in. Due to that, the company is making many people sick and the food being produced out has been contaminated and there has been no report of it.</text><user>108814928665262238132<//user>< Pics>

Inconvenient layout makes navigating the pumps very difficult during high traffic times. Locals lacking common sense only adds to the frustration. Also, the price was $3.09 today which is not great for Arco. The Arco on SF Rd near the 118 was $2.99.<//text>

Did a great job,  not finished yet.  Need to get colored in,  but that was my request to wait.  Very great, skilled,  friendly artist Javier that was patiently kind to me.  I was a bit of a baby about it.  Lol</Review>

I've gotten several piercings from Adrian and he also stretches my ears. He's really good at making clients feel comfortable and relaxed, and  always guides me through the pain in a calm way. I also have 5 tattoos from here, and each one is clean and beautiful!< /Review>

I got my conch and forward helix pierced yesterday. I called to see if they could fit me in that day and they could which was really nice cause no one else could. When I got there it was quick and I was there for barely 20 minutes. Although it was painful but that’s a given, Adrian was nice and pretty funny.<//review>

Bottom line, I wouldn’t recommended for a piercing. They cant tell you for sure if their jewelry is stainless steel, or what ? He said “I think so”. I got an infection and called and was told to “try calling back tomorrow “. Just horrible quality. You are rushed in and out so they can get the next customer. I was told to clean with hydrogen peroxide which is the ONE thing you shouldn’t use to clean because it’s abrasive and kills the cells that need to help the wound heal.
Don’t make the mistake I made.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>After 17 years of wanting a tattoo, I finally got one. Although it's super small, I love it.

My friend and I have talked about getting one together for a while. She has quite a few. We decided one Saturday night before we were going out that this was the night. I looked online and found a few places that were open past 8pm. Player's Ink had great reviews, was open later and close by. I called and they said AJ would be bale to take us if we could make it in before 9pm. We got ready and headed over.

AJ was super nice and helped me through the process, especially in selecting the right place for my first one. I wasn't nervous since I do have a high pain tolerance, but I wasn't sure what to expect.

Overall, the pain was bearable, I was in and out in 30 minutes and I love my tattoo. I'll def be coming back to this place when I get my next one and would recommend to anyone interested in getting their first one here!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>My experience with Players ink was awesome. My artist name was Everett Medeiros, he was wonderful. He made me feel comfortable and I felt relaxed the whole time. I was very happy with my tattoo it was exactly what I wanted and the color was brilliant. Before I left he handed me his business card and offered a complementary touch up. I was very pleased with my visit here.</Text>< pictures>

The artists are super cool, layed back and they are like a family. Josh Everett did my work and it was an amazing experience he's super friendly and the best part is he does not have a super heavy hand so it did not hurt one bit, in fact I damn near fell asleep.<//Text>

I went in to get a tattoo of a phrase on my wrist. It was very well done. The only problem was it was misspelled accidentally by the artist. In the artist’s defense, when he drafted it, it was misspelled, and when he asked me if it looked good I said, “Yes” not realizing the mistake. When I looked back at the photo I gave him before his draft it was spelled right however. Other than that, the guy did a great job.</Review>

The place was very clean and the staff were friendly. J.T. did my tattoo and was kind to help me out with the design. I was a walk in that came an hour before the place closed, so hats off for them taking me in. Oh and the tattoo came out great!</Review>

Got my first ear piercings here, very happy with my choice. The guy who did my piercing definitely took pride in doing a good job, and took care to mark both positions and used a needle for the piercing. No blood, very little pain afterwards, good price.< /review>

Been going to JT for years now. He does amazing color and lines are always clean. I have a full sleeve from him and a couple others and have never been disappointed. He's straight up and will give you honest and realistic advise..... just know what you want when going. Even when I move out of state I will come back just to get my work done by JT.</Text>

Went as a walk-in for an industrial piercing. Adrian was super nice to talk to and was great at talking through the procedure and aftercare and was careful to consider the placement of the piercing with the glasses I wear. Turned out great, and cost less than any of my other piercings have been. Really glad I came here!< /Text>

My friend and I were walk ins for piercings.  We were helped fairly quickly and our piercer did a great job as far as cleanliness and making sure everything was sanitized.  My piercing did get very very swollen and when I went back 2 days later another piercer took a look and said that the placement of my piercing wasn't the best but he was very helpful and told me to come back in a few days if it wasn't better.  It did end up getting better and my friend never had any issues with hers. Prices are very realistic as well<//Text>

<text>Bad piercing spot, had my nose pierced here, guy put in the wrong size jewelry in the wrong location. Had lots of bleeding issues for weeks and ultimately had to get the piercing removed by other professionals or else would’ve needed surgery to get the jewelry out.

Stopped in to get my ear pierced without an appointment. Adrian took me right away and was extremely nice and professional. He pieced my ear by hand (which I highly prefer to the piercing gun) and it looks great! Very knowledgable and would highly recommend. Great prices too!</Review>

Called earlier in the day to get a piercing done, the piercer stated that he would be there until closing. Waited also 45 minutes with a colleague until we said forget it. The building was starting to get filled with other people that wanted piercings so we went elsewhere...<//Text>

<Review>So my friend and I just got our noses pierced here, with a walk in, after being rejected by another place, but the service was absolutely incredible they were so nice. They do use a needle not a gun so it definitely hurts more but its a lot cleaner and safer. I get light headed easily aftet something like this and they were so nice About it. They let me stay and sit down and brought me water and kept coming over to check if I was ok, and cleaning it. The price was really good compared to my other piercings, and there was no fee or hassle. I 10/10 recommend. And I hear there tattoos are great.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fcca8f5bea0a5:0xd20e41c87062bb09</GmapID></record>

As of late got a Lord shiva tattoo from PLAYERS TATTOO and I am completely fed with my tattoo!! JT I'm happy you completed a marvelous activity and given me a shock. He set aside the opportunity to tune in to what I had as a main priority and concocted a beautiful outline. The representation coordinates the photo gave down to each and every detail and JT included a couple of SHADES of his own to give it a one of a kind look.

We must be said to be alive in those minutes when our hearts are aware of our fortunes. Much obliged to you JT for giving me that. Best tattoo<//Text>

This review is for a piercing experience at Players Ink.

TL,DR: My piercings generally went well, but one was done with too small jewellery and it caused me problems and I had to go back and get it tapered up a size 2 days later. Now everything is good.  So I would reccomend Players Ink if you do your own research on the correct jewellery sizes and techniques for the piercing you want, and can be an informed and assertive customer.  However, if you want high quality internally threaded jewellery and the best sanitation and expert piercing possible, I would go to a specialty piercing shop.

I got 3 piercings done 3 weeks ago by Adrien. My experince was mostly positive and the piercings are healing up pretty well. However, some things from during and after my visit would make me hesitate to reccomend this place for complex or sensitive piercings. I think it is probably fine to get more common piercings like lobes/basic cartilage/lip/nose if you are comfortable doing your own research and know how to practice good aftercare.

Pros:
- My piercer, Adrian, and the staff were professional and kind.
- The piercing room was clean and organized.
- Adrian did a great job keeping everything clean and sanitary. skin cleaned with betadine, used new sterile needles and multiple pairs of latex gloves.
- They use the correct piercing techniques for the piercings which i got (i had researched beforehand and asked about the methods before committing)
- I had no signs of infection after (I also did 2x daily sea salt soaks, the standard aftercare to keep fresh piercings clean and help healing)
- i was a walk-in about 6pm on Saturday evening and it was not busy and i was seen quickly.
- The price was quite reasonable - though to some extent i now feel 'you get what you pay for' was true based on this experience vs a specialty piercing store like Cold Steel in SF.

Cons:
- Jewellery was disinfected in a cup in rubbing alcohol after I chose it - not with an autoclave. The other supplies were all sterile one time use.
- They only had externally threaded stainless steel jewellery - no titanium or internally threaded options.
- No paper of aftercare instructions given - so make sure you do your research and practice good aftercare to prevent your new piercing getting infected (2x daily sea salt soaks with 1/4 tsp salt per 8 oz boiled water).
- Unfortunately, one of my piercings, which was in a very sensitive area, was done with too narrow a gauge of jewellery (16g). This size is risky as it increases the chance of tearing the skin if the jewerly gets caught. It was also very 'sharp' feeling.

I ended up with too short jewerly in this latter piercing because while i initially asked for a 14g barbell, Adrien pressured me into 16g. His reasons seemed logical at the time, but it turned out he was incorrect, when I did my own research later.

Unfortunately, the smaller gauge did not work for me, it was quite painful and irritating.  I actually went back 2 days later and had the fresh piercing tapered from 16g to 14g and a bigger barbell inserted. This hurt, of course, but it was way better than risking the cheese wire effect from the thin jewelry on a very sensitive part of my body. The piercing was immediately much more comfortable, even an hour after sizing up the jewellery, and is healing well now.  The fact that Adrian was misinformed on how to do this piercing means I would definitely not recommend going there for something unusual or really complex - i would reccomend going to a specialty piercing shop for those.< /Text>

<userid>109183242187581096522</userid><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>I’ve known Dr. Usman Javed when he was doing his Residency at the VA Hosp. He was then a very good and caring Resident and then after Residency he was a cardiology fellow.  So when I  needed a Cardiologist, I went to him that was 8 years ago.  I was treated well by him as expected. He was very knowledgeable, pleasant to talk to,  and explained and answered questions very well.But then in 2015, I switched to another HMO health insurance so I had leave his office. This  year  I switched back to my previous health insurance and I am so grateful that I was able to go back to him because I know that he is no longer accepting new patients.
I have multiple health problems but I am confident that I will be treated well by him.
The front and back office personnel are very professional and pleasant to talk to. Everyone is kind and friendly.

I highly recommend him to everyone!< /Text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Dr. Javed was very thorough. He was on time for my appointment. He took time to explain the options for my procedure . He is very personable and cares about his patients. I’m so glad I changed to him to take care of my heart issues. His staff and he are a great team. I feel confident my care is in good hands!!!!<//text>

<Review>Was taken back to the exam room and waited maybe 5 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor listened to everything I had to say and seem to be genuinely concerned about me. He spent at least 20 maybe 30 minutes with me and never seem to be in a hurry. He changed my meds and explained why. I have several test coming up soon I'm very happy with him<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

I’ve known Dr. Usman Javed when he was doing his Residency at the VA Hosp. He was then a very good and caring Resident and then after Residency he was a cardiology fellow.  So when I  needed a Cardiologist, I went to him that was 8 years ago.  I was treated well by him as expected. He was very knowledgeable, pleasant to talk to,  and explained and answered questions very well.But then in 2015, I switched to another HMO health insurance so I had leave his office. This  year  I switched back to my previous health insurance and I am so grateful that I was able to go back to him because I know that he is no longer accepting new patients.
I have multiple health problems but I am confident that I will be treated well by him.
The front and back office personnel are very professional and pleasant to talk to. Everyone is kind and friendly.

I highly recommend him to everyone!< /review>

Dr. Javed was very thorough. He was on time for my appointment. He took time to explain the options for my procedure . He is very personable and cares about his patients. I’m so glad I changed to him to take care of my heart issues. His staff and he are a great team. I feel confident my care is in good hands!!!!<//review>

Was taken back to the exam room and waited maybe 5 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor listened to everything I had to say and seem to be genuinely concerned about me. He spent at least 20 maybe 30 minutes with me and never seem to be in a hurry. He changed my meds and explained why. I have several test coming up soon I'm very happy with him</review>

< Review>
I would like to thank  Dr. Shaukat Ali, Nurse Practitioner Karanvir Kaur and front desk staff for their friendly professionalism and the thorough effort that led to a successful quadruple open heart surgery that has blessed me more than I can express.
Thank you for your patience and explaining to me in terms  I can understand throughout the process leading up to the surgery and thank you for the follow up. Thank you Dr. Khawaja for the gift of your hands and the encouragement of my going forward. A special thanks to Fresno heart hospital, San Joaquin rehab and Clovis community Hospital.

Stop bye at this Fed Ex Kinkos today and I was totally blown away with Lisa's customer service. Lisa went above and beyond in assisting me creating my fed ex account she has tremendous patience and a magnificent attitude. Fed ex should recognize a good employee like her.  Thanks Lisa!</text>

This is my not my local FedEx but I drive out of my way because here they are always fast and efficient. Today especially I had a great interaction with Jesse who went out of his way to fix something I did wrong with no hesitation. I didn’t even expect it I was already planning how I was going to go home and fix it and he took care of it. It’s really appreciated and I wanted to shout him out because it was such a simple gesture but unexpected on my end and I'm really grateful! Thanks Jesse!< /Review>

Karen at Sam's has been so helpful over the years. There were several times when I needed a piece of equipment sent to me overnight to a location and she's never failed to get it there. Great service and so knowledgeable.<//review>

<Text>Very poor customer service.  I'm handicap & not only were they rude but not helpful.  In fact the manager closed the door on me before I can hold my balance.  I almost feel.  I use a cane & her actions could of hurt me by falling on concrete floor. You need to discipline her immediate.  BBB will get a complaint from me<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2c7e79bdad829:0x5ee1ec92e88ba968< /GmapID>< UserId.>

Never go there.! Very bad experience! They always disrespect customers.
I was trying to return my laptop to my employer. with my employer's FedEx account. But the staff charged the packing fee to me instead of receiver's account. They refused to follow the instructions. My other colleagues didn't pay anything for this retuning at another FedEx office.</Review>

Horrible customer service even though there's almost 10 employees on one shift.

Very inattentive and unresponsive staff including the assistant manager who looks like he's 18 years old with a attitude and manners of a 5 year old.

I came in to print a few documents that are time sensitive.

After trying get someone's attention there for about 10 minutes and then explaining to him numerous times what I was having a issue with.

I was put through a run around and whirlwind of stress on top of the broken machines I kept on getting send to.

This location ended up billing me twice once for 10 dollars and another charge for 14.95.

I printed 18 sheets of paper total in black and white.

Requesting a refund is another nightmare of its own because the 1-800 number apparently gets turned off after certain hours.

If that's how you like your bussines handled and your financial and God knows what other informatio used.

This the location to go. It's very popular with the USC students both graduate and undergraduate.</text>

Service is horrible. I went to the FULL SERVICE WINDOW, since I have never been there and they can help print out pictures. The guy directed me to the computers. SO WHY DO THEY HAVE, FULL SERVICE, WHEN THEY DO EVEN SERVICE YOU? So I ended up waisting  30$ trying to figure out how to print. N didn't even print properly.  The lady that I asked for help said she didn't know how too, "just go to file hit print in color" that was her directions. But the picture were zoomed in so u could even see the face of the person in the picture.
I think if ur ganna work at a place at least know how to do the job....I get it ppl work to earn a living but do what you know how to do. Thats like a banker being a firefighter! What does a banker know about putting out fires?< /Review>

I have been standing outside in line in the cold for an 1hr + to ship off a package.  The majority of the time you saw three people working and then finally after an hour another 2 gentleman come out looks like the office to assist. Clearly there’s no sense of urgency here. I wrote this standing in line and I’m still not inside.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>This location has everything you'd want or need in a FedEx office, but my review is directed towards the staff. They're generally helpful and knowledgeable about everything you'd need help with, and my personal experience interacting with them was more than pleasant. This is the first Google review I've ever posted, and the honesty and integrity of the staff at this location prompted me to do so.

I brainlessly left my wallet sitting in front of one of the computers in the workstation... and didn't realize it until around 5 hours later. After stressing out got me nowhere, I retraced my steps and realized this store was the last place I remembered seeing it. Lo and behold, the staff had secured my wallet, and it was returned to me without a single dollar missing. And this SOB was PACKED with cash.. an admittedly stupid amount to carry on me but I hadn't had a chance to deposit it yet. Anyway, it was incredibly refreshing to see a display of honesty like this.. maybe I'm cynical and too focused on all the bad in the world, but I wasn't expecting to see my wallet again, and had completely given up hope that the cash would be in it if it was returned. My faith in humanity has been restored, thanks to a FedEx. Strange but true<//review>< pics>

Lisa, the senior manager, at this here location, is a saint! Who do i get in contact with to suggest a raise in her salary? I mean the display of rude, ignorant, circus freaks carrying on demanding things and insisting the machine must be broken when they simply cant read or write to save their lives. Better woman than myself, my hat definitely comes off to you at the very least somebody please send Lisa a much deserved vacation. Ill pray for you in church.</review>

This FedEx has great costumer service. I went in to laminate a school project and they said it would take a couple of hours. I told them that I needed is as soon as possible and they had it ready in 45 minutes. They also gave me a student discount on top of that. The person who assisted me was the assistant manager and he was very patient and understanding. I recommend this FedEx to everyone.<//Review>

A little understaffed at times, but all in all decent service, even though I've waited in line sometimes up to 20 minutes, when I finally get my turn I get a smile and a hello from Romer or any of the ladies that work there. Even though sometimes they are tired they manage to provide the right information and great service. You come in there with a bad crappy attitude and you will probably get the same returned back to you. Change that energy and you will get back good energy. Great little spot.</Text>

Incompetent. I’ve worked for Fedex corporation for 4 years! And the young Mexican female customer service specialist doesn’t know what she is doing. First off they do not have ANY one rate boxes larger than a small. Then this incompetent woman tells me she can’t give me a rate for a shipment unless it is packed and ready to go. I’ve worked at her exact position for 2 years...that’s exactly what we do all day. Makes the entire company look terrible. Will never come back. And will be sure to tell everyone within the company Fedex express and Office about this particular center.</review>

Usually, I think of FedEx Office/ UPS Store/ Printing and Shipping Places as an unbearable drama of mishaps, but this place proved me so wrong. Had a question about placing my online order for prints, called the store, the employee had me explain what I wanted and then gave me the store email to send the file to and said she would take care of the order from there. Less than 24 hours later I got a call it was finished! Everything was exactly how I wanted, reasonably priced (worth noting other print shops had quoted double for the same job), and the pickup was super easy and friendly. Store was clean and well staffed. Would go back here.<//text>

<Text>FedEx is the worst shipping carrier to work with. Every time I bring in a shipment no matter how well its packaged they say they cant ship it without charging me for them to repackage it with their supplies. Every time. Yet if I take the box to either USPS or UPS they ship it no problem. If I didn't have clients who wanted me to use their FedEx accounts I wouldnt even try with these people anymore. When I call their own corporate offices they tell me the "rules" the employee at their own store just told me don't actually exist. Do these people make commission on the shipping supplies they sell or something? If you want to pay 20 dollars for shipping supplies worth 3 bucks and then overpriced shipping then by all means use FedEx.</Text>< Pictures>

Horrible store!
Been there 3 times!!.
Faxes: i was new to self-service couldn't get to make it work and even there was no customers and CS saw me struggling never helped. Until I lost it and wet to look for someone.
Copies: same experiance as faxes lost $3 trying to make it work until i got someone to help me.
CR they see ppl walking in and struggle with the self-service ALL the time and even if they're not busy they just look at you with the corner of the eye and walk away to the back of the store.
I have seen this all 3 times i was there.
Customers helping each other with the service, classic!! This is one of the services that wonder why they exist or have workers inside if they don't help.<//text>

The supervisor, instead of compensating me for the trouble, he overcharged me. Extremely disappointed with FedEx management.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Haven't had any major issues. I just use the self-service printers there. Occasionally one is unavailable due to repairs, but there's usually another I can use. They can print tabloid size, but I bring my own paper to print on. I also don't have a scale to weigh luggage, so I was able to use theirs (for a very large and bulky bag) to make sure it wasn't too heavy to check.</Text>

<Review>Claudia insisted on charging me for packaging that was the exact same as what my package was on. She was rude and condescending. She insisted I forward my complaint to the manager even though her tag said she was the manager.  Although I have patronized this store previously, for the same service with no issues, I won't ever again. Thanks for the worst customer service and gauging your customers Claudia!

<Review>The worst I had to print out something and then it was charged for $4.50. I needed help the lady helped but I didn't understand so, I asked again. Then I had to print and they kept charging me. The over all total was $8.50, that was very ridiculous!!< /Review></record>

<text>One desk assistant insisted on calling me Big Man, while another incorrectly directed me to the wrong desk for shipping then got rude with me when he was called on it. Service was terribly slow as workers really didn't seem to care that people were waiting in line. I had one pre-paid box to drop off and was stuck in line for 20 minutes. There was only one person ahead of me in line.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Highly recommend! I have LOTS of anxiety about going to the dentist.
They made me feel comfortable and I believe the treatment plan is actionable and has my best interest in mind. The staff is friendly and very professional from the moment you walk in and throughout your appointment. Thank you guys! I will be back.< /Review>< Time>

Incredible. The dental staff treated me like a person, talking me step-by-step throughout the process of getting a cavity filled, instead of silently poking needles into my mouth and treating me like a dead body in a morgue. Really really friendly and welcoming staff. The best experience I’ve ever had in a dental office!< /Text>

< review>
Best dental office ever! Just like the majority, I hate going to the dentist. Thinking about going into an appointment makes me anxious. Since going to this office I can say my perspective has changed. The receptionist Michelle is super helpful and has always gone above and beyond to help me with my appointments, insurance, etc. The hygienist has also been very helpful in answering all my questions and giving me great tips and recommendations on how to maintain great dental health. She even followed up with me a week later after my cleaning! This is not something I have experienced before. From prior experiences at other offices, hygienist come and do their job and leave the questions for the dentist. And definitely never received a follow up from a hygienist. Dr. Arlen Vartanian is by far my favorite dentist. I’ve had two fillings done and I can say they were absolutely 100% pain free!!! I hate fillings and I have always felt some sort of pain and discomfort. Not with Dr. Vartanian. He is gentle and does a fantastic job. He helped me relax and I was able to remain anxious free throughout the entire procedure. I truly didn’t feel anything. Even after the local anesthesia wore off, I felt fine. I didn’t even feel like I had a filling done. Thank you all for the great service, for making me feel comfortable and safe, and most importantly by showing that you truly care about your patients!<//review>

<text>My tooth chipped off Yesterday. Called them in the morning and did not expect a rapid appointment at all. Office staff? very friendly and helpful got me in the next day and got to work.
Arlen Vartanian was the best. He advised a crown procedure, I felt very comfortable knowing that it was going to be a very painful procedure.  It wasn’t at all.
It took couple hours with a temporary crown and I was relieved. Thank you soo very much.< /text>< Pics>

Not once have I experienced any pain during my routine cleanings and x rays. The office is spotless and they have extremely safe and smart protocols in place during these Covid times.

Update: just had my routine teeth cleaning today. The office continues to utilize safety measures that are streamline and reassuring. Each staff member is so professional and I know that I am getting quality dental care!. Thank you all at Dr. Vartanian' s dental office.

My experience from start to finish was reassuring and positive. There is a clear respect for patient and staff safety from the moment one enters the office. This is due to the fact that Dr Vartanian has been proactive in utilizing the best practices and protocols to maintain as safe environment as possible. Thank you to the entire staff for making this venture out during this pandemic so positive!</Review>

As always everyone in the office are very professional. There's no rush time is taken to explain what is being done. When Dr Vartanian does his examination he makes you feel comfortable and again explains his findings so you understand and answers any questions you may have. Good experience start to finish.<//Text>

After being treated by the previous dentist, Dr. Foss, I thought no one could be as wonderful as he was but when Dr. Vartanian took over the practice, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Dr V. is a highly competent and caring dentist.  I travel from the Palm Springs area--a long distance--and will continue to do so.  I feel fortunate to be cared for by such a terrific dentist.
His amazing staff continues to be the cherry on the sundae--professional, friendly, and always helpful.< /Review>

< review>
Was welcomed into reception area, with an open door, (literally, did not have to touch any door knob), sanitizing dispenser, distanced seating arrangement, pens separated into two containers, one clearly labeled "used", and my comfort level enhanced, by the additional precautionary protocols, i.e., antibacterial mouthwash for rinsing my mouth, prior to  my teeth cleaning. Staff is clearly following and implementing COVID-19 precautionary measures. Leaving Dr. Vartanian's office, I felt validated on my decision not to cancel and reschedule, having experienced some ambivalence, prior to this appointment. Excellent service and mindful consideration to the 'new normal.'< /review>

Let me start by saying before coming here, I didn’t have the best experience at the dentist.
Dr. Vartanian and his amazing team have cured this fear!
The entire staff has always been so sweet, informative, and helpful for all dental needs.

< Review>
Dr. Vartanian is truly a master at his craft. His staff is very professional, his office is immaculately clean and his practice seems to run like a Swiss watch. I recently had a crown installed and was beyond impressed with his level of of service and professionalism.< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Vartanian is a rockstar. One of the most down to earth dentists one can have. He is thorough, swift, and highly trained. He gives you exact information as to what is going on with your teeth and gives recommendations based on what he has evaluated. He does not try to get his patients to have any extra work done than what he feels is necessary. He is very personable, and cares about everyone he cheats. A consummate professional</Review>< date>

Dr. Vartanian has done a superb job of taking over the practice from Dr. Foss. He is knowledgeable,  friendly and funny.  It is a pleasure to sit in his chair.  Barbara,  the hygienist has a tender touch and is also very competent.  The front office is (and has been)  ably taken care of by Michelle and Tanya, to make it a dental home run! Dr. Vartanian uses his expertise and time to make sure that everything is done correctly.  He and his staff are very professional and engaging.< /Text>

<text>Feel comfortable knowing I am in good hands and not too fearful of going to the dentist. My hygienist is thorough and great and does a terrific job of cleaning. The lady who took  my X-rays was so good and gentle as I am a gagger. I liked the new technology of digital x rays.Dr. Vartanian checks all the work and does a very thorough job. He offers comments and isn’t pushy to do other work that most doctors insist you need. I will never go anywhere else. I love all the staff.

<review>Wonderful staff with a cool Dr. This was my first dentist appointment in LA and it was a smooth experience; there was no wait, no crazy up-sells and accepted my insurance. The staff and Dr Vartanian were very informative. There is plenty of parking at the back of the building. Glad I found a great doctor on my first try!</review><resp>{'time': 1572368695274, 'text': 'Hi Pat,\nThank you so much for your kind words!

< Review>
I had a molar that turned out to need a complicated solution to save. Dr. Vartanian and his staff coordinated a unique customized solution that involved bringing in an endodontist. The process took multiple appointments over several weeks that  included one day with a Dr. Vartanian appointment and an endodontist appointment, back to back. The procedures were coordinated with the goal of having the most optimal outcome for my molar possible. Throughout the process Dr. Vartanian and his staff ensured that I was comfortable and pain free during the procedures. I am happy to report that my tooth is now fully recovered, and is the most comfortable in my jaw than it has been in a long time. Thank you Dr. Vartanian. Shout out to your wonderful caring staff as well. Tooth #19 and its partner in crime #19.5 send their best. - a grateful patient.< /Review>

Nearest Papa John’s for us. Quite a drive to pick the pizza. But never disappointed with quality. I wish they open one in Evergreen San Jose area as well!< /Text>

<Review>One of the worst experience I had here at the store. I ordered for 5 toppings large pizza. Chicken, green peppers, olives, mushrooms and onions. When I checked the pizza at store, i found only 2 pieces of green peppers, 3 pieces of onions and no mushrooms at all. It had olives and chicken. When I asked the guy (just one was there) he showed me that small piece of onion, and rudely said they will put what ever is in the order. Since I had already paid for the pizza before checking it, I took it home. I thought there will be some buried pieces of missing vegetables, but me and my wife could not find one. Very horrible experience. I would not recommend this place.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Worst customer service ever!!! I have waited over 2 hours the driver said they called they never did! So I finally talked to a manager and asked them to resend it they wouldn’t even offer a price reduction or even any compensation now by the time my pizzas finally get here it will have taken 3+ hours. Absolutely terrible the entire store needs new employees from top to bottom including the manager!!!< /text></record>

Great prices and excellent service.  They actually use the right amount of pizza sauce.  Domino's and Pizza Hut hardly ever uses any sauce if any.</Review>

Really good pizza. Great when hot and fresh. Only thing is location. At night it is kinda sketchy. Lots of vagrants wondering and yelling. Otherwise food is good. Staff is nice< /review>

The specialty pizzas are amazing. Philly cheese steak is my favorite! But it's like they put all the greatness in those pizzas because the basics pizzas are not very good for the price.< /review>

Tommy was great. We came near closing, late at night after a long trip with my hungry kids. He offered to bring my pizza to my car so I could sit in the car with my kids and not get out in the pouring rain. I appreciate him going the extra mile for us. Great customer service< /Review>

< Review>
Called for a pizza at 8:24 p.m. and it's currently 10:19 p.m. and have not received anything. I called to double check on my order and the person was very rude. Was talking all muffled and could not understand what he was saying. I understand that it's a Friday night, but this is your job to provide a decent customer service. I've ordered from there before and they had the pizza ready in 20 min and that was carry out. It's almost 2 hours and nothing. They suggested I just cancel the order to make it easier on them. Giving two stars because the place does have good pizza, but will definitely reconsider buying from there again.< /Review>

<review>The only reason I give a One is because I got  them to bring me another two pizzas.
They are cheap. Everyone there is Indian. The world isn't lying, cheap.  No business making pizza.
Listen. U pay for individual toppings u expect to see that on your pizza. I ordered Papa John's because I figured how bad can you mess up a pizza?  I'll tell u what. I have no reason to go to India and start selling Chinese food...it's not going to be right

Burnt, burnt, burnt. Both cheeses we're brownish-black.  Dry!!!
SAUCE IS WATERED DOWN!  DOESN'T TASTE LIKE PAPA JOHNS sauce elsewhere.

If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it's all ducked up!! Save your love of Papa John's and don't order at this one.

Update: second set of mediums came and they looked just like the first; burnt black spots entire cheese, crust has mostly black color. nothing like Papa Johns' yummy crust I know this veteran deserves and everyone else for $25 a freaking medium 🍕
So I had to not eat again, and sent it back. So far I'm put $28 bucks and I realize I'm never gonna get the pizza I'm looking for. To different standards
I feel sorry for the delivery driver.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Pizza is good but way over priced. I paid $28.50 for a large "The works" pizza witch is basically a standard "combination" pizza. Average customer service. I ordered for pick up at front counter and my pie was ready in about 15 min.</text>

The pizza was not as good as Dominos and round table, therefore I wouldn't come back again. The workers were not attentive becsuse my friend tried to pay a soda and kept trying to call their attention and they kept chattering. They were not friendly and neither were helpful when asking about their menu.< /Review>

This location has great pizza however it seems that the employees and management don't care about walk in customers or aren't trained properly to handle a heavy workload website says they close at 10 including on Yelp but everytime I try to order before 9 o'clock they tell me they're closed this place needs a serious management facelift</text>

<name>Rodolfo Martinez<//name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>(Translated by Google) Very good service I recommend the top three pizzas and you can choose it to your liking and it is very cheap. The service is very fast and good although I recommend calling before to only get to bring the pizza and thus save more time the truth is very good pizza.

Very good variety of gourmet dishes. Pleasant service, a bit confined feeling inside, but partially due to a small space with a popular restaurant. I'd love to see them expand someday!</review>

<Text>That tea leaf salad! SWOON! Really great food, best to get there early to avoid the wait. If you do get stuck with a long wait, they might refer you to their sister restaurant, BStar, which is down the street - just as wonderful! And it also serves the tea leaf salad :)</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>MYANMAR 🇲🇲
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
With a smattering of locations spread out all around town, the cuisine of Myanmar is not the most in-your-face food in and around Los Angeles, but it is also not the rare find that many Daw Yee-only diners make it out to be. This El Monte restaurant, which took over the former site of Little Malaysia at the very beginning of 2017, has quietly lived like many of its peers, without rustling too many feathers in big media.

For anyone who has traveled or lived in Myanmar, some of the strongest sensual memories come from early mornings sitting over spicy bowls of mohinga ($6.99), the fish noodle stew that is ubiquitous on busy streets. Especially on cold winter mornings, pots are steaming well before the sun comes up and tired faces sit together slurping before work.

The other most well-known Burmese dish tea leaf salad ($9.99) is fortunately on the hit list, checking off all the boxes that it must. It is hard to rival the amount of fighting yet balanced flavors and textures that are all at work in this salad, spicy and sour and funky, crunchy and soft and slimy.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2JR7WTF8nnZB8Kf_YRYCr5tgpExQ5-I7HWCcB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG8gT2DSbWlYUywJXIp2B5owYT-QN3XvanjiF0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWdvc9fZXSCONU5jfIOW7C3jQGCW5YFAKwSkeI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPslCO4is0AJ6DeSBqhXMkeJFG8P5AQjUgxnoPV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfLiqhg_QOSRQnmFgI67OX9Ck-KqJA2G8FolWR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2icvWyWVB4E1dUppxeXiugO5AVzuBYGbwQLtZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Long wait on the weekends.

The tea leaf salad is really good. I honestly can't remember what else we ordered, but it was good. Clearly not as memorable as the tea leaf salad though.< /Text>

<Text>We got there on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm;  it took about 5min to get a table.  Tried the tea leaf salad and the Chili pork belly.  The tea leaf salad is ok, but the fired beans in the salad is little hard.  The chili pork belly is a little too fat.< /Text><Response>None</Response><user_name>Rachel Cox</user_name>< gmapID>

Overrated. When I first had tea leaf salad many years ago, it was exceptional - almost a revelation. Either my taste buds have changed over the years, or Burma's quality has gone downhill. I suspect a bit of both. The tea leaf salad is not bad, but no longer a superstar dish.</Review>

<Review>Cetana Mon Myanmar Restaurant was incredible! I had no idea this place even existed but I loved it!

The food was on another level. I had their famous chicken, pad thai, and their spring rolls appetizer. The flavors were delicious. It was some of the best Malaysian food that I have had. The service was solid and the restaurant was clean.

Can't wait to go back and I would definitely recommend Cetana Mon Myanmar Restaurant !<//Review>< Rate>

Chili lamb from Burma superstar was a superstar dish! I loved the spice so if you like spicy food, this will definitely bring you back for more. Food came pretty fast and it was hot! The onions were crunchy and delicious.</text>

I've been jonesing for Burmese food ever since I was introduced to it by my boyfriend's mom. If you want something extra unique, wait until the weekend to order their sour leaf (chin paung kyaw) appetizer. You can ask them to make it as a plate with rice, and it will be a meal to remember.</text>< Pics>

If you're not familiar with Burmese Food, I ordered they Kyay oh, which is best described as Burmese Pho. It was good and the portion was large with a lot of noodles.... A lot of noodles both flat and thin. Will be back for sure to try more.< /Text>

Have never tried food from Myanmar before, and now I'm so glad I did! I can't remember the name of the noodle dish I ordered, but it was delicious. It had several meats, including fish balls and quail eggs. I added chili flakes and a little bit of fish sauce and almost ate the entire bowl!<//Text>

So yummy, so bustling and I love a well run restaurant. Fermented Tea Leaf salad is an obvious yes, but really any of these salads will blow your mind. Flavor and texture were on point for me. And they made sure my drink arrived ASAP when our food came early.</text>

<text>At the time of this review, Burma Superstar did not have outdoor seating and was take out only given the COVID era.   We ordered our food in advance via Yelp and it was promptly available upon pick up.   Burma was a Superstar by taking appropriate precautions upon entry to help safeguard its patrons and staff from COVID with safe distancing, masks and plexiglass partitions.   Had been wanting to try Burma Superstar for some time and enjoyed the platha and dip, samusas, fermented tea salad and mango chicken.  Also ordered ginger lemonade which was quite tangy and refreshing.<//text>< rate>

Service was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. Drinks were amazing. I got the mango tamarind drink which tasted really good and I had the lamb dish with coconut rice which tasted amazing. I would definitely come back to this place.

You guys rock. Keep up the good work.<//Text>

They seemed like they had too many people to take care of and it took a while to get our drinks. The food was super fast though. Cetana Mon Myanmar Restaurant  cooler was delicious. Would go back again!</text>< Pictures>

<text>It is a not so bad place to have Burmese food. There are not too many Burmese places in this area, so I hope they up their game. The Tea Leaf salad was good but the fish cake curry and chicken biriyani were average. Give it a try, maybe you will find something that suits your taste.< /text>< Resp>

Been going at least once a week for months now. All of the food is consistently delicious, with flavors that can only be found in Burmese cuisine. Tastes just like as found in Yangon. Highly recommended for something different and an alternative for Asian, vegetarian, pescatarian diets. (Though the meat curries are great too.)</Text>

I call this excellent restaurant many times because I love the  special atmosphere that is characterizes this restaurant. The team is highly friendly and experienced. The service is exceptionally efficient. Most important, the food they cook is exceptionaly good. I ate there often and I was always joyful. The expense is honest. I highly recommend this place to to all.< /review>

<text>The Store is open for business. The store is clean and the staff members are friendly.
This was my fist time back to this location and they are taking extra steps to keep the store clean and the customers safe.

I wish to thank the staff and store owner for making feel safe at your location.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Greatly improved everything !

The absolute best tuna and I recommend just tomato and onions , maybe some banana pickles , light oil and vinegar .

But if you want a turkey or roast beef sub, respectfully ....go to jersey mikes . No comparison .< /text>< gmapID>

I work in the middle of two Subways and noticed this one on my way to 7 Eleven one day for snacks.

I kept forgetting to try it out until today and I'm sooo glad I did. This location is easy to get in and out of. At lunch it's not crowded and it's easy to find parking unlike the one off of Lake Forest.

The sandwich artists are friendly and fast and they don't skimp on the ingredients. This Subway is a lot bigger and also cleaner. I think this is my new Subway. Yay!</review>

Poor service, I’d asked for a 6” that was $2.50 and when I choose the bread they talked that the bread that I choose cost more I choose honey oatmeal and They charged $4.30!< /text>

Came at 6:30pm on Sunday.  The lady working was rude and even before ordering said she closed in 30 min. She threw everything on the sandwich and it was super sloppy. Don't recommend coming here.<//Text>

Not that great. Not that bad. Pretty mediocre Mexican food. Probably great if you’re hungover. Staff was super nice and worked hard. I can tell that they keep their ingredients and recipes very authentic. But I just was not wowed by the place.</text>

Good, moderately priced Mexican food from a Santa Barbara institution. Everything is prepared right as you order it. Good range of selections, but decidedly  not fancy and in the same building it's been in for decades. Portions are large, so  be aware that your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.< /text>

<response>None< /response><Text>This place is hyped up to be more than what it really was. There was a super long line and it wasn’t a fast line. Service was good and it looked like an authentic Mexican food with Mexican ladies working the kitchen. The food however was quite disappointing. I ordered the tacos de adobada and tacos de costilla and their guacamole. All the tacos were bland and not seasoned, the guacamole although good was also bland and needed some salt. The flour tortillas were really good though. I would not be back lol<//Text></record>

Honestly I don't get it.  This place is famous. Got very strong recommendations.   The tacos we got were.... OK.  Not all that tasty.   Served really plain.  The tortillas were better than the meat.
My son got some beans with chorizo and bacon.... sounds delicious,  right?
No. Bland. How is that even possible?</Text>

Super basic tacos. Nothing fancy here, just solid, authentic Mexican tacos. Stack some good meat on a couple corn tortillas and that's it. Strongly recommend the pork, especially with the melted cheese. Getting some fundito is always a good call, so you can drizzle that over everything else.</review>

Food is average. Came here 5 years ago, quality has dropped. Wait time at 8:30pm to order was short, maybe 5 minutes - the wait for the food to be made was another 55 minutes after that.
It's been overhyped with the old Julia Child endorsement that's drawn up its demand but in 2021 it can't keep up and doesn't compete. Food prep time needs to improve. Quality isn't the same. Would recommend any other taqueria nearby - there's many more that deserve your money and time.<//review>

I heard so much about this place and wanted to try it as I was passing through Santa Barbara.  I was very disappointed. I ordered a chorizo taco, I did not care for the meat at all, was a little greasy. I also had an adobado taco, seasoned well, but nothing spectacular and I also ordered a gordita. The masa lacked flavor and needed to be salted, the beans were not spicy at all. I will say, the salsas were delicious and I did enjoy the fresh made tortillas.  I had an horchata which tasted really refreshing with my food, however, it did leave a bad after taste in my mouth.  Possibly came from the chorizo taco? Definitely will not be eating here again.<//Text>

Food is always fresh, using real ingredients, made from scratch, while you watch.   The staff is friendly and accommodating. Everything was great.< /text>

this is one of my boss's favorite spots in town (and also apparently Julia Child's?) they take cash only by the way and they have a small parking lot as well as some street parking. there's a few outdoor tables and a ledge where you can stand and eat as well. very limited indoor seating (it's really more for waiting for your food but some people sit)

I ordered the vegetable tamal and the super rica especial while my friend ordered two steak tacos and also the super rica. We also got the horchata which was quite cinnamon-y but a bit too sweet for my taste. My friend loved it though!

Vegetable tamal: (5/5) have never had a tamale before and I had no idea what to expect but this was delicious! The texture was great but it didn't come out super hot so that was a bit disappointing. The cream sauce on top is truly delectable. My only other note is that I wish it had a bit more flavor or spice (I added the spicy salsa and pico de gallo but it was still not to my standards)

La super rica especial: (5/5) If you get anything here, I'd recommend you get this because it is spectacular. The char of the roasted peppers with the creaminess of the cheese and the flavor from the pork is...chefs kiss. They make their own flour tortillas in house (which is interesting as I'm used to corn) but the tortillas were really wonderful and a bit thicker as well. It comes with 3 tortillas but I honestly would've been happy with just the 1 since it was too big to pick up anyways

Steak tacos: (4/5) the steak was not dry which I usually get worried about - it was sooo juicy and jam packed with flavor. I would order this again next time too!<//text>

I’ve been to this place numerous times, lines are pretty quick to move. Only downside it’s CASH ONLY, so come prepared with at least a $20 or more. Tacos are medium to small sized, so 3 orders generally needed to feel satisfied imo. Tortillas are made on the spot & amazing, meat is suberb but when we went it was bit dry considering all their sauces are not there like how it was before covid. We got the #1 & #14. In hindsight we should just got more of the latter. #14 is like a cheesey chorizo fondue type of meal that you slap on tacos & my god was it tasty! Also their horchata is suberb, my girl eyes opened up when she drank it! I would definitely recommend!<//review>

Understandable, I guess... And the portions were a bit small, so we had to go to Mony's after to get some snack tacos to fill us up. But all in all, we would visit again if we come back to Santa Barbara!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Mexican Fast Food at its finest!

La Super Rica’s Taqueria is by far the best Mexican Fast Food place I’ve eaten in the United States.  There I said it.  The taste,  freshness, and authenticity will make you appreciate this Mexican restaurant.  Julia Child was right when she called this place her favorite restaurant! 👍< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVVKN4HRNmENnyb0qvttvJaw2x9xD__8-ogIQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoGE7MRKDJWarV4iaN-ERq_alHFlpkLkVihio=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
We arrived for a mid afternoon snack and although there was a decent crowd in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait longer than 2 minutes to order. We stepped up to the counter to order from the friendly man who we assume manages or owns the restaurant. Behind him was a women hand pressing and grilling fresh tortillas made to each order. I ordered one beef and one pork taco while my girlfriend placed an order for a beef taco and some guacamole. In addition to that, we both purchased a Mexican Coca-Cola from the bottle.

When you have finished ordering you can sit in a room that has an a fantastic views of the mountains and the hills of Santa Barbara homes that lead up to them. The lighting is particularly nice this room because you are surrounded by windows. At this time in the day I also noticed some people do work laptops and taking their time eating as they read the newspaper. I was a very pleasant environment to eat in.

One could argue that a good taco is only as good as its tortilla and let me tell you! This place makes one bombass of a tortilla. The fillings were simple and traditional. There was an option of three types of salsa. All of them were you know, top-notch as well. And if your looking for a little something something extra, order some guacamole because that was delicious. You know... is was just really really good. Check it out.< /Review>

If you like Mexican food, you have to try this place. Mexican food is probably my favorite type of food but often authentic Mexican restaurants aren't really to my liking. Mainly because I only like chicken breast and authentic places generally serve thigh. Luckily this place serves breast meat.

I had their number 8, chicken breast with onions and green peppers with corn tortillas. Perfect. It was very good. The wife had number 16 especial, marinated pork, Pasilla peppers and cheese. It was amazing.

The restaurant is a bit of a whole in the wall. It doesn't even really have a sign. But everyone seems to know about it. The line was out the door. But the food is worth the wait.<//text>

Love the made to order tortillas with every dish. Mainly menu items are based on whatever can be incorporated onto, in between and over the small corn tortillas. Tacos are also a main stay. Nice covered patio section to enjoy your eats. No burritos or tipical large combo plates. Mostly el la crate. Cheers< /review>

I had their number 8, chicken breast with onions and green peppers with corn tortillas. Perfect. It was very good. The wife had number 16 especial, marinated pork, Pasilla peppers and cheese. It was amazing.

The restaurant is a bit of a whole in the wall. It doesn't even really have a sign. But everyone seems to know about it. The line was out the door. But the food is worth the wait.</Review><date>1504915470963< /date></record>

How to even begin... this place is literally the best. We’ve had so many types of Mexican in San Francisco, Baja California, Mexico City, around Texas, but we were blown away by the quality and the prices here. We’d highly recommend stopping here if you’re in the area, their special is fantastic, but you really can’t go wrong.<//text>

As always, delicious food, great variety and awesome service! Their meat is super tender and my favorite — the raja taco (taco de raja). We drive 2 hours just to enjoy their yummy food! Worth the drive 😋<//Review>

<Text>We arrived for a mid afternoon snack and although there was a decent crowd in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait longer than 2 minutes to order. We stepped up to the counter to order from the friendly man who we assume manages or owns the restaurant. Behind him was a women hand pressing and grilling fresh tortillas made to each order. I ordered one beef and one pork taco while my girlfriend placed an order for a beef taco and some guacamole. In addition to that, we both purchased a Mexican Coca-Cola from the bottle.

When you have finished ordering you can sit in a room that has an a fantastic views of the mountains and the hills of Santa Barbara homes that lead up to them. The lighting is particularly nice this room because you are surrounded by windows. At this time in the day I also noticed some people do work laptops and taking their time eating as they read the newspaper. I was a very pleasant environment to eat in.

One could argue that a good taco is only as good as its tortilla and let me tell you! This place makes one bombass of a tortilla. The fillings were simple and traditional. There was an option of three types of salsa. All of them were you know, top-notch as well. And if your looking for a little something something extra, order some guacamole because that was delicious. You know... is was just really really good. Check it out.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpCiiPlioSqEX_ZCINlti73IctyWwqIO6NzN-R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJXXB9bGB-NjdTXLEpGYHsXfgBLu4fBVSr1UdF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7ZFVfCd6vZ_fMhZJuwLrjgdk7-b0vGuIrHUOo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCUWvXduNbhNNcKKG8yKbBN9DhBudfJU9sPe4o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This definitely lived up to the hype! The flavors were delicious and really gave us a new appreciation for Mexican food! However, the wait was loooong. Understandable, I guess... And the portions were a bit small, so we had to go to Mony's after to get some snack tacos to fill us up. But all in all, we would visit again if we come back to Santa Barbara!</review>

Make sure to get the honey and just put it all over everything. I usually like the tenders more than the sandwich at other places but the sandwiches here are so well balanced with the cole slaw.< /Text><Rating>4</Rating></record>

Bring cash and use the usually long wait time to study the menu — as the main hold up here is people not knowing what’s being offered.

Everything is homemade and the tortillas are YUMMY! Enjoy a cold beer alongside and the divine smells.</review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I’ve been to this place numerous times, lines are pretty quick to move. Only downside it’s CASH ONLY, so come prepared with at least a $20 or more. Tacos are medium to small sized, so 3 orders generally needed to feel satisfied imo. Tortillas are made on the spot & amazing, meat is suberb but when we went it was bit dry considering all their sauces are not there like how it was before covid. We got the #1 & #14. In hindsight we should just got more of the latter. #14 is like a cheesey chorizo fondue type of meal that you slap on tacos & my god was it tasty! Also their horchata is suberb, my girl eyes opened up when she drank it! I would definitely recommend!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8l7hbwOp9vM4EnXgiV9c6lrtFiwd0VPxJfiUM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3Bkp3Vmxs5O0lgEI-gbK1YQvinRIN4XNNn1ZT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Prepare for a wait to order. Also prepare for a wait to receive your food selections. The parking lot fits approximately 1 car, so street parking will hopefully be your friend. The eating area isn't large and can full. The bathroom is small and carries the ambiance beach town taco stand dinginess/quaintness. With all this being said, the food is incredible and employees are helpful. I never pass up an opportunity to eat here. I will gladly wait in line. I will gladly embrace the crowds. And I will gladly include my stop at La Super Rica in every Santa Barbara visit!  5 stars all the way for making my taco dreams come true!</Text><GmapID>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c< /GmapID>< Time>

Try their "agua de sandía", deliciously refreshing drink with chunks of watermelon. I have enjoyed everything I have eaten here and the prices are incredible considering the quality and presentation of the food. Very good service, foods comes fast.</review>

It’s as amazing as the reviews say. The tacos were all freshly made in-house, and were thick and flavorful. The meats were fresh and plentiful. My favorite was the chorizo quesadilla!<//review>

Prepare for a wait to order. Also prepare for a wait to receive your food selections. The parking lot fits approximately 1 car, so street parking will hopefully be your friend. The eating area isn't large and can full. The bathroom is small and carries the ambiance beach town taco stand dinginess/quaintness. With all this being said, the food is incredible and employees are helpful. I never pass up an opportunity to eat here. I will gladly wait in line. I will gladly embrace the crowds. And I will gladly include my stop at La Super Rica in every Santa Barbara visit!  5 stars all the way for making my taco dreams come true!< /review>

There's usually line outside whenever I go so be prepared to be in line for half an hour. The food is very flavorful and the sauce is delicious. Make sure to get the honey and just put it all over everything. I usually like the tenders more than the sandwich at other places but the sandwiches here are so well balanced with the cole slaw.< /Review>

Fun spot to grab excellent Mexican food. Expect lineups during dinner hours but worth the wait. Excellent menu. Cozy, casual unpretentious eatery</text>

This place is a Santa Barbara classic. If you live in town and you haven’t been, shame on you! If you’re visiting, it’s definitely a recommended stop. Try anything with tortillas, as they’re made fresh with your order and are some of the best in town. Be aware that the fare is simple and bare bones, but that’s a part of its appeal.

This restaurant is cash only and has no ATM on site.</review>

<review>Place is cash only and will have a wait at lunch, but it is worth it!! Food is cheap and amazing. Horchata here is delicious. If you get the chorizo quesadilla, be aware that it's whole chunks and not ground (I prefer chunks more tho!!).< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC9MU5fvxIn393lQb9tNdVJJQnwBrvmEmpUgn8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Great selection of food, with some good specials. Decent number of Mexican beers and non-alcoholic drinks on offer as well. This place is cash only, so make sure you're carrying enough (decent meal for two with drinks would be $25-$40).

Food is good with seemingly authentic flavours, but I would not call it exceptional. I would recommend the Tamale in food and the Tamarindo in drinks. The ambience is average - it is in a sort of a shed, and feels like you're eating at a canteen, but I guess that adds to the experience.

There is usually a long line to enter this place. We had to wait for about 30 mins on a Friday afternoon. It is a good experience eating here overall, but I am not sure if it is worth the wait.</text>

<text>I may be biased on this opinion because this is one of my favorite places, and the long line and wait are always worth it for me. If you haven't been, the tortillas are all homemade tortillas, and there is usually a wait, and it's cash only! So bring cash!!!!  We bought tacos de bistec, tamales,  Chile relleno, guacamole, rajas, and even café de olla. Yup we tried it all. The tacos are a little bland  but with the right ingredients they are very good (I'm talking lime, guacamole, and salsa), I always get these. They had a few specials for the day we tried the Chile relleno and the chicken tamal I enjoyed both. The coffee was good with a cinnamon kick  a little too sweet for my taste. The rajas are always on the menu and they always taste amazing. They have cheese and are layered on top of two homemade tortillas. They can be a little spicy from time to time. Always get a guacamole side, they give you a lot and it's a good serving for sharing and adding away to your food as your heart desires.< /text>< pics>

<Review>So big taco fan here. Just had a carne asada and chorizo taco along with a side of guacamole and horchata. I read a ton of positive reviews of this place so I decided to try it out. Went around 7:40 pm and there was a long line outside of the place. First off parking was a bit of a hassle. You have to find street parking. Next it took us about 15 minutes just to order. After finally ordering we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the food came out. It seemed like they were backed up. Now the tacos were pretty good. Decent flavor, steak wasn't juicy I felt like it was kind of dry. The side of guacamole was delicious really made the meal. The horchata was delicious so glad I ordered it. Overall the taste of the tacos along with the wait time isn't worth it for me. I gave it three stars due to overall flavor and ridiculous wait time and parking access. The best tacos I've had are in Tijuana, Mexico. Also don't forget to bring cash. Cards are not accepted.<//Review>< Response>

One of our final stops was in Santa Barbara, in a restaurant called ‘La Superica’. It looked like an old Mexican barrack with its white walls and blue windows. It was not fancy at all and it was nothing like what I would have picked to conclude a mind-blowing trip. But as soon as I went inside I felt that the atmosphere was very welcoming. It was packed with joyful people enjoying lively dishes and for a minute I forgot that my journey was nearly over. I ordered tacos and as soon as the food was placed on the table I understood why my friends took me here.

The fresh handmade tortilla was beautiful with a golden shade of yellow contrasting with the different mouthwatering ingredients sitting on its heart. I could smell the fragrant odour of the corn flour with a zest of lime tickling my nose. The meat had a lovely brown caramelised tint and smelt heavenly. It was tender, smoky, juicy and cooked to perfection. The red salsa was thick, creamy and attractively opaque in colour. I could tell the tomatoes had been cooked slowly and mixed with toasted Mexican chilles and chipotle peppers. The topping was a symphony of colours where the chopped green vegetables were dancing with the fresh herbs under a moon of white creamy cheese. I could see the finely minced onions blending with the minced crisp cabbages promising a textural crunch.

No sooner had the fresh taco touched my palate that I felt shivers and stopped. It was absolutely divine! An exquisite pleasure invaded my senses filling me with all California. Each bite, each colour, each flavour had the taste of my trip on the mythical Highway One. I could see the sunny valleys, the Spanish missions, the rugged beach and the surf towns. I could smell the farmers’ stalls on the side of the road, I could hear the Pacific Ocean crashing down below the steep cliffs and I could feel the intoxicating warmth of the Californian sun and the presence of my friends forever with me.<//text>

Was honestly a little underwhelmed with the place. We made it a point to stop here for lunch since it had such great reviews and so many recommendations. Perhaps we just went in with too high expectations but didn't think the food was that great. Be ready to wait in a very long line. The prices are great. Just not sure it was worth the wait / hype.</review>

<user_name>Todd Duncan</user_name><review>That will be $13 dollars please. What? You're kidding me. $13. Wow. Best meal for two at such an amazing price.
#16 Super Rica Especial and Tamal Norteno de Puerco.
The tamale was delicious so we went back for seconds. We paired it with the pico de Gallo which was spicy due to a healthy amount of jalapeno.
#16 was also delicious. Heavy cheese, loads of pork on top of the freshly made tortillas.
The place was busy on a Saturday night but not overly crowded.
Definitely worth the visit!<//review><gmapID>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c< /gmapID>< Resp>

<review>We had hoped for more, as the reviews were raving about the food here. But most of our meat was over cooked and dry. The best dish we had was the Super-Rica Especial, with the cheese on top. That was quite delicious! Also, the horchata and the watermelon juice were delicious as well< /review>< Pictures>

Yet the food comes out the side window to the covered eating area quite quickly. This plus the handmade corn tortillas and salsa helps bolster the experience.

Wait- not ideal

Beware they cook veg, chicken, bead, and pork on the same platform. You might end up getting some chunks of other meat in you plate.

No good for pure Vegans and Non Beef & Pork dinners.< /Review>< Pictures>

💥Great Food💥 I've been eating at La Super- Rica since I was 19 years old. When I first came out to California. 1970💥
Nice Family owned. Julia Child's, a world renown chef, was a regular customer.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Best Mexican food I've had (Caveat: I haven't been to Mexico, so this is based on a range of experiences in the US.)  First visit in 1984; the food is still excellent. The problem is deciding what NOT to order. Superb tortillas, freshly made.  Don't let the line scare you. (And I don't wait in restaurant lines)    Quality/Price ratio is huge.< /text>< pictures>

We got two tacos and a tamale. Great price and decent size portions. Highly recommended!<//review>< Pictures>

La Super Rica is one of our go to restaurants when visiting Santa Barbara, it is a institution in the area. Everything on the menu is delicious.  Authentic Mexican food.  Home made tortillas.  Definitely worth a visit. Not fancy, often a line and parking is a definite challenge,  but well worth it.</review>

Maybe very hyped but the food was deceptively bland and unimpressive. Nothing better than any other random Mexican place.
Prices are amazingly cheap though.<//review>

< Review>
Born and Raised in Santa Barbara and this is hands down our favorite taco spot. We have been going here for years.

I have get to find a taco spot that compares to or beats my love for La Super Rica. The owner is such a sweet man and they staff,has always been awesome.

When someone asks for a Mexican food spot in SB this is always my suggestion. Since we moved away from SB we only get here once every 3 months. The only down fall is they are closed Tuesday's and Wednesday which is usually the days I end up in town.<//Review>

Amazing food! Very affordable but tastes like high end food! Would definitely recommend. Hand made tortillas elevate the delicious tacos. A must visit, but get there early because a line begins to form as soon as they open< /Text>

Horrific parking, limited seating, long lines, housed in a small old shack with a tarp for a roof. All is overlooked and overshadowed by it's phenomenal mexican cuisine; a must go to for any person visiting the santa Barbara area.</review>

<Review>So incredibly authentic and delicious.  A must go to stop if you are in Santa Barbara.  Worth it as a destination as well or to go out of your way for.  They make everything fresh even the tortillas.  You can see them slicing tomatoes for pico de gallo and making everything else right in front of you.  I miss it now that we’ve left SB.

Locals enjoy arguing rather or not La Super-Rica deserves its reputation or if it is just riding on Julia Child's coattails. I just know that I always enjoy their food and beverages when I come here. There's usually a line (and I hate lines), but it usually moves fast. I won't get into which Santa Barbara taqueria is the best, I'll just continue to enjoy the good food from all of them.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><review>Very bland food. We ordered a variety of items. If you like good California and Baja style Mexican food you will be disappointed. People who hate spicy or hot food love this place. I only saw white tourists lined up like me cause Julia Child loved this place.

Food was good, prices reasonable.  Good selection of tacos.  Parking may be hard to find.  Small dining area but with everyone eating tacos the room turns over quickly.< /review>

Small portions. I ordered chorizo and they gave me about a cup of cheese with a little bit of meat inside that didn't taste anything like chorizo. The coffee had cinnamon flavor and all I wanted was a regular coffee.<//text>

“Gentrified tacos”.....very dry taco shells  with very dry service. Zero authenticity, zero personality, zero originality. On top of which unreasonable prices. The tacos are unacceptable......The worst....Don’t wait your TIME!!!!!  And these people have the nerve to not have the AC on full blast in August!!!!! Good day SIR.</Text>

<text>What an awesome place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let it's look scare you away. Everything seems to be made fresh & while you wait, including the corn tortillas. I don't think there is a bad thing on the menu, and everything is so well priced that you can afford to try several items during 1 visit.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Unfortunately living on its reputation from years past.    Other places in town have caught up.

Food is fresh with good ingredients. Love the family atmosphere.

Still like to go for the memories.  Try to avoid peak hours since the wait outdoors in the sun is tough</Review>

<Review>Visited this local spot for the 1st time, yesterday. My parents always make a special trip here, when they travel along the coast. A "doggy bag" comes home with them for me and my husband. The food is INCREDIBLE! So fresh! Handmade corn tortillas, roasting poblano chiles, fresh tasting aguas frescas. You definitely can not go wrong with this place. A little expanded menu than most little hole-in-the-wall taco places. CASH ONLY!! I suggest trying to get there when they open as I overheard people in line talking that the line can get long. Try the Rajas taco or just order #'s 1, 11, 16, and 20 with some of there house made pico de gallo and red salsa. ENJOY! and don't forget to tip them.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c<//Gmap_id></record>

Best taqueria in Santa Barbara.   May be the best anywhere.   The handmade tortillas are fantastic.  Everything on the menu is great.   Don't miss out on #16 Super-Rica Especial.   They don't dress the tacos.  They have a super simple salsa bar - red, green and pico, all are good.  They also have a specials menu.  Give them a shot, especially the tamals.    They always have a line but it moves quick.  Enjoy!<//Text>

Stopped here on the way home from a trip to Los Olivos to give traffic a chance to blow over. It was obvious by the line that this is a very popular locals place. They need more staff to keep up with demand. Only one guy working the register and taking orders (and getting abuse from a couple unhappy customers). There was an empty window that could have reduced everyone's stress level with another order taker. For me they lost a star for that. The register and kitchen are in the same small area, so I do give them credit for not having much room to work in. I give them a lot of points just for the tortillas. Small, hand made to order and delicious corn tortillas. My wife reading about them is what drew us to the place. We both ordered chicken tacos and they were pretty good. The chicken was tasty. The dining room was packed and we were tired so we got our order to go and ate in the car. It's about a mile off the freeway but we might give it another chance just because of those tortillas.<//Text>

Don't be scared off by the dumpy exterior. This cash only taco specializing dining spot is a Santa Barbara classic. It usually has a line extending outside the front door. The dining area is humble and covered with a big tarp but it's part of the experience eating there. The food is authentic and they offer both small plates, like the queso bowl, and larger posted which are like fajitas. They've also got excellent homemade salsa and legit selection of Mexican drinks. This place will not disappoint!</Review>

<review>Came here with all the hype, but holy moly, the tacos were super bland and tasteless. Probably better when Julia Child came by and ate, but honestly would not recommend this place at all. Super overrated and that is not an hyperbole. You're off better going to Chipotle- at least they have somewhat of a flavor.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great Santa Barbara Taco Shop! The pork taco I had was tasty but the unusual cheesey Pastilla taco was the highlight. It is a cash only place and I only had a little cash or I would have tried a couple other things.</text>

I don't know why folks go on and on about this place. I have eaten here multiple times and the food is decent.  That's it.  Average.  Also, last visit I had to wait over an hour with my kids to get our meal while I watched people in the dining room walk to the pickup window, effectively skipping the 30 min line, and order a SECOND meal to go... a second meal which was prepared and served before my first meal.  Forget about this place and its nonsense.  There are half a dozen places within 5 miles that won't let you down. Sorry. 1 star.</text>

Honestly the food is so simple. But there's something about it that makes it so good!  Seriously delicious food at relatively low cost. Comes out quick and it feels cozy inside the restaurant. Busy place though!</text>

I've been eating here for most of my life. Though I don't live in Santa Barbara anymore, it's still a place I visit every time I'm in town. The nostalgia for years past certainly helps its appeal, but so, too, does the fact that virtually nothing has changed here with the quality of the food. Freshly made tortillas are still a rarity and no place does them better. Mexican food is as varied as any other food culture from such a diverse country, so calling it "the best" isn't really fair. That said, this place is the best!</text>

<text>Is the food worthy? You decide. They are located at a corner and, for me, all starts when you look for a space to park your car. They only have 3 spaces in their property and the two sides of the block seem to be taken already so you have to drive around. Once you make it to the line, you usually can count between 5 to 10 people ahead of you. They have a supersmall kitchen and 7 employees that bump each other while working. The cashier not only takes orders, he also receives food from the cooks and serves it to the customers at the counter. All this consumes about 15 to 20 minutes waiting in line and 10 to 15 sitting in front of the table waiting for them to call your order number. Don't  get surprised if they call customers that came after you first. The reward is some of the most tasteful rib, and marinated tacos around SB.<//text>< Time>

Almost everything they have is gluten free. Tortillas are made fresh with your food.

Long lines because it's a favorite with the locals so go a little, not a lot, hungry! So worth the wait, an incredibly sweet family running this restaurant and a million times better than any chain restaurant.

One of our favorites restaurants in Santa Barbara.  A institution in the area. Food is always great.  Lots of great choices.  The beans  are amazing.  Super Rica is must if your in the area. Small place, expect a wait.  Parking is also difficult.<//text>

This place is a classic. Expect a long line most weekend evenings, but it's so worth it.  The dishes are small and reasonably inexpensive, giving you a chance to taste several offerings. Parking can sometimes be problematic on busy evenings. Great food, highly recommended!< /text>

It's 4:30pm on a Wed. Drove up to Santa Barbara for the day from Camarillo. This place supposedly has some of the best tacos in Santa Barbara. But I'm never going to taste them because they are CLOSED on Tuesday & Wednesday. Excuse me, am I crazy, or is this just some kind of strange Santa Barbara thing, but who in the world is closed on Tues. and Wed.!!?? A 5 day a week restaurant? Never heard of that one. Asian places closed on Mondays, sure. Must be doing really good in Santa Barbara but my business will never come back here.</text>

<text>Shared plates with my girlfriend,  little bit of a wait but well worth it!  Had a number 12, 14 and 16.  All where very reasonable.  Food had amazing flavors and the portions where perfect for lunch.  Plan to stop here each time we come back.< /text>< Date>

The food is amazing ! I recommend #16 But you better bring cash because they don't take cards or Apple pay .
And wait time to order can vary depending on the time of day and year . From the order wait time until you have food in hand sometimes can be 45 to 1 hr not a not the place for a quick bite . They are closed Tuesday and Wednesday. Enjoy</Text>

< review>
The food here is okay, it really depends on what you order. If you order the steak tacos they are tough, dry, chewy and bland. But if you order a tamale, you will LOVE IT! Horchata is to die for, with a sweet cinnamon taste. So don’t order tacos and skip the dry meat, and go for a tamale and horchata. The guacamole is really good as well. It’s fresh and just all around yummy.
The line is slow and when you are standing outside it gets hot.
But the staff is really nice, helpful, and patient.
But I wouldn’t come back because you can get just as good tamales at other places, the line is just NOT WORTH IT!</review>

Delicioso!!  The handmade tortillas are exceptional. Everything we ordered was crazy good! We were full and then we saw the people next to us had some amazing looking enchiladas  with a creamy sauce over them and found out that it was one of the specials of the day and of course we had to order it. We rolled out of there.  Warning the line is always long! So if you're in a hurry forget it</Review>

When in Santa Barbara, do absolutely find the time to visit this little rugged tacqueria. The food here ia exquisite, from the home made tortillas to the tacos to the specials. Flush down your grub with their refreshing agua frescas, especially the cantaloupe one if on the specials board.< /text>

<Review>This restaurant was ranked by Robb Report as one of the best 150 restaurants in the world. It was ranked number one of restaurants that serve on paper plates. Julia child said it was the best Mexican restaurant that she has been to. I have been going here since 1984. I have spent a ton of time in Mexico. This is the real deal for sure. As a tip, I would encourage you to ask for an extra half a dozen tortillas or so. They will charge you some minimal amount but it is well worth it.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Homemade tortillas and rice and beans - simplest things on the menu but my fav! I could eat every meal here while in town - the only reason I don't... they are closed on many of the weekdays during the winter. Make sure to check before going. Otherwise a must stop!<//Text>

CASH ONLY. Pretty good food at a decent price. Parking is horrible, but I enjoyed eating here. Drinks are a bit overpriced, but not too bad.  The food itself is tasty and otherwise seems a decent value. Fresh made tortillas help. Really long waits (25 min Friday at 1:30pm) to order.<//text>

<text>How do people even call this "Authentic" or "Mexican food" ? It is neither, it boggles my mind every time I pass by and there is a line out the door. There is real Mexican food along the Milpas corridor try one of those spots instead. Someone called this place "a hole in the wall" made me laugh...< /text>< Name>

<review>I think we ordered wrong, going for the basic tacos (simply meat on tortilla, and the meat not wonderful at that).  We each had one of the "special" tacos too, which were much more interesting and tasty - mine a blend of zucchini, cheese and pork; my husband's roasted mushrooms in a creamy sauce.  2 tacos was more than enough to fill us up - the portions are generous.  I'd go back for another try given the reputation, but would tend towards the specials and more "interesting" dishes on the menu - based on my experience, this is not a place for the basics.< /review>< userid>

Delicious and affordable Mexican food.  The items offered are more interesting than your typical Mexican restaurant, and the prices are very good for the quality.  There might be a small line at peak hours, but it moved fairly quickly.  All of the items are sold individually, so if you order 2 or 3 things that should be enough for one person.</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>CASH ONLY. Pretty good food at a decent price. Parking is horrible, but I enjoyed eating here. Drinks are a bit overpriced, but not too bad.  The food itself is tasty and otherwise seems a decent value. Fresh made tortillas help. Really long waits (25 min Friday at 1:30pm) to order.< /text>< pics>

I went here by recommendation. I'm a Mexican visitor and this restaurant was good, when I was told this was the most amazing Mexican restaurant I would ever try. Not bad, but not that good. 4 stars for me is a good valuation.  I would go to Los Agaves restaurant (1 block away) if I wanted to try Mexican flavor 100% , but this one is more expensive.<//text>

<text>Wonderfully flavorful and unique food. I've been eating here for 30 years and never tire of the Super Rica Especial - the number 16. If you are want a beans and rice place, don't come here. If you want very fresh and tastes food that you don't get anywhere else - Super Rica is it. The line gets long, go early or later, not at peak times.<//text>< Pics>

Probably best restaurant in Santa Barbara (Oaxacan style Mexican food). Almost always a line and closed Tuesday and Wednesday but if the wait to order isn't more than 30 minutes, it's well worth it. Everything is hand made and fresh, some dishes are pretty spicy.</Review>

<text>This is THE best food i've ever eaten in my life. It would be a crime if this place doesn't serve food throughout the rest of human existence. If you go during prime dinner hrs the line may be long. So just go to dinner a little earlier or later than usual.

Can't describe how much of a pleasure it is to eat these tacos. I make noises when I eat them because they are so good.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

CASH ONLY. That was the only negative point. Had to walk BLOCKS to find an ATM. Luckily I got back just in time to order. and the food was AWESOME and very reasonably priced. Will definitely go back next time I'm in SB.</Text>

<Text>Yes, you have to try this place at least once. Don't be discouraged by the long line, and expect to wait for an open table. Bring cash because they don't accept cards or checks. My favorite is the chorizo with melted cheese served in a bowl with a side of tortillas. If they have any when you visit be sure to order the watermelon juice over ice!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>The best taco stand in Southern California.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that stop you from going inside.  Everything is great and they have a huge selection.  Get the Rajas and use it as a topping for other tacos.  Cash only.</text>< pics>

Any place with a line out the door is a good indicator. I think what really for me pushes it to 5 stars is the prices are very fare. I usually order a number 1 and a 13 which are two beef tacos and like a  herself founded type thing with the tomatoes in it...oh and all the corn tortillas are fresh!</Review>

This place seems to be much more about reputation than good tacos. Not bad, but also not worth the inflated prices. I don't mind waiting in line for great food, but this wasn't it. Better tacos can be found all over SoCal for half as much, with no line.</Review>

<review>Stopped by this super down-to-earth canteen style taqueria where the name says it all. Everything we had was super rica. Just don't expect anything fancy. This is the place to go for great and authentic Mexican food, spice it to your liking and grab some cool refrescos. Free parking in the street available. Great value for the money.<//review><Date>1533650383236</Date></record>

Don't understand the positive reviews. The wait is interminable both before and after you order. Sure the food is fresh, but that means nothing if it is overcooked. The meat is consistently dry and the salsas are flavorless. I've heard their chilaquiles are to die for, but each time I've gone, they have run out! Not worth it.< /review>

There fresh corn tortillas, number 12 is my favorite one. And the special  menu of the day the, which they have most of the time vegetarian tamales. Really delicious. I really recommend this place. FYI it's close on Wednesdays.</Review>

< Review>
Amateur food wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Especially me being from Mexican decent, a native to sb and more yet that I live around the block from this place. It only takes cash to top things off. And your better off going to Lilly’s tacos or corazón for tacos which are on a whole different level to these tacos. And if your looking for anything else Mexican walk to los agaves which you won’t be disappointed. Anyone that like there food don’t know what is true mexican cuisine is. This is a step up from Taco Bell or jack in the box and thats it. I’ve been to this place twice in my life and wish I never did. I would give the same rating to any fast food place.< /Review>

<Review>We love this place and can't wait to come each year when we visit from. Boston. My only feedback would be to encourage those dining alone to eat at tables together. It gets really crowded and tables disputes could be avoided.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Everything about this place is perfect. The cafe is very pretty (windows all the way around) and clean. The food was fantastic - especially the adobado tacos and the tamales. The drinks are also amazing. We had the agua de sandia and the best horchata I've ever had.<//review>< pics>

The tacos are very little and the wait feels like an eternity smelling those heavenly scents wafting out the door. That said, it's worth it. So get there way before you want to eat, order more than you think you will need, and bring cash because you will need it!< /Text>

If Julia Child ate what I ate this place would no longer be her favorite taqueria. The tortillas are fresh made and the agua fresca was good but that's about all the good I can mentioned. tacos were no salt, no flavor, chewy meat, dry dry dry chicken. There were also paper thin tamales and  runny beans we only ate because we didn't finish the dry tacos. They probably leaving off their Julia Child glory. So many other places to eat great tacos in SB.< /Text>

Amateur food wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Especially me being from Mexican decent, a native to sb and more yet that I live around the block from this place. It only takes cash to top things off. And your better off going to Lilly’s tacos or corazón for tacos which are on a whole different level to these tacos. And if your looking for anything else Mexican walk to los agaves which you won’t be disappointed. Anyone that like there food don’t know what is true mexican cuisine is. This is a step up from Taco Bell or jack in the box and thats it. I’ve been to this place twice in my life and wish I never did. I would give the same rating to any fast food place.</Text>

The world would be a lesser place without Superica taco. I don't care what anybody says, I make no exceptions, there is absolutely no argument against this position, but La Super Rica Taco is the finest taco restaurant on the face of planet Earth. No exceptions.< /text>

Authentic food... Pretty delicious. This place is really popular and can take awhile to get your food ad the kitchen is inefficient but food is good one you get it.< /review>

Been coming here for years always loved it. The food has always been full of flavor that mixes perfectly with the hole in the wall asthetic. My personal favorites are the Chile relleno and the super Rica especial. Over all great :)< /text>

Their Cafe de Olla (black coffee with cane sugar and cinammon), chile relleno with avocado cream, and rajas (I think) taco (grilled onions, chile strips, and cheese) are all unbelievable.

Oaxaqueno chicken tamale with mole is very good.

Costilla and other meat tacos were not as good showcases for this place's specialties, which - per the name - are the cream- and cheese-heavy dishes!< /Review>

<Review>Tacos. Tacos, tacos, and more tacos. Tacos with hand-made tortillas while you wait! Get one of everything, because they are all fantastic. My favorite if I had to commit would be the chorizo tacos. Often a bit of a line, but it goes pretty fast. Gives you some time to decide what to get! Their small quesadillas are fantastic as well if you're a vegi person. Vegans need not apply.< /Review>< rating>

Please note that Google's description of Super-Rica is incorrect. You will not find fish tacos here. I've been coming for more than 30 years. My family loves the sautéed beef and onion dishes. I love vegetarian options such as the chile relleno. They offer what I think of as home style Mexican food, not street tacos.<//text>

Long wait but I think it was worth it. Order a bunch of different items and they were all good. Guac was a great addition as was the horchata!</Text>

< Review>
Mexican food in California has significantly changed since Julia Child endorsed La Super-Rica Taqueria as her favorite place to eat in Santa Barbara. How has this no-frills teal-colored Mexican outpost stood up to time? Is it worth a visit, or shockingly over-rated?

I would personally not wait in the reportedly insane peak-hour lines to eat here, but I’d definitely return for an early Wednesday lunch when it opens at 11am, rubbing elbows with local newspaper-wielding seniors, which is exactly what I did when I visited La Super-Rica Taqueria. There was virtually no line, and I was eating within 10 minutes of my arrival.

The “Super-Rica Especial” was the most expensive dish on the menu at $6.80, but worth it. Chunks of al pastor pork that have been marinated all-day share a plate with fire-roasted pasilla peppers stuffed with queso that melts and tastes like a Oaxacan cheese or dry mozzarella (and could actually be one or the other). The cheese acts as a binding agent, tempting attacking forks to pick up cheese, pepper, and meat all at once. With just a hint of delightful piquancy in each bite, this humble dish is not about heat as much as it is about the earthy, lush, multi-layered flavors of a Mexican home. The “Super-Rica Especial” is grade A certified “comida de abuela.”

I was much less impressed by the “Frijol Super-Rica,” which is perhaps unfair, given the fact it is a side dish advertised merely as pinto beans with chorizo, bacon, and chilies, and is offered at a measly $2.55. However, I'd expect these beans to be more strongly flavored than they are with the chilies and pork products, but they’re just slightly-above-average pinto beans by southern Californian standards.

I have admittedly been long-intrigued by the surprising shout out to “La Super-Rica Taqueria” in the second verse of Katy Perry’s “This is How We Do.” I must confess, I too was tantalized by the possibility of a wild night at this Santa Barbara institution, “scarfin’ tacos,” and “checkin’ out hotties.” But I can assure you, my friends, this really isn’t that kind of place, and hopefully never will be.<//Review>

Arguably the best tacos in town, but it's debatable if the it's really worth the wait with so many other great taco places in town.</Review>

Get ready to wait but it will be worth it. Handmade tortillas and a small indoor / outdoor seating area make this one of my favorite restaurants in SB.<//text>

<Name>Ricky D<//Name><date>1476152376219</date>< Review>
Last night I came here was my 1st time and I left a bit disappointed for 2 reasons. 1st reason is that even though I came early (around 6 pm) n there wasn't a line when I ordered, it took 30 mins to get my 5 tacos n 2 quesadillas ( i was starting to think they had gone to kill the cow...) and I wasn't the only one waiting a long while for my food, there was several other people  2nd reason was that when I finally got my food, the meat had little flavor. The only positive thing I can say is that the tortillas are fresh, hand made then n there. I doubt I'll be going back< /Review>

<userid>109085284779747125931</userid><Review>This is one of the lite gems of Santa Barbara. Even though this isn't your cheapest street taco spot it makes up for the 3 dollar price tag with enough meat to turn each taco into 2, wrapped in their signature made to order corn tortillas  that to my surprise had more of a  I usually go with the OG carne asada tacos with a healthy helping of their fresh pico de galo and salsa for an extra kick. To me the way the meat is cooked in combo with the fresh made tortillas make it worth a stop and a cut above the other Mexican food places (except for Los Agaves which is my favorite at the moment).</Review></record>

It was a disappointingly bland stuffed chili relleno. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara does not have one taco joint that compares to the amazing taco joints in San Francisco –– even La Esquina in NYC has better tacos! And for truly unique home cooked Mexican food nothing in Santa Barbara compares to Nopalito SF. Santa Barbara also does not have one good Napoletana pizzeria. So, there are opportunities here, if you're so inclined.< /review>< user_name>

This is very clearly a favored spot. We arrived to a long line with no one complaining about being in the line. I got a adovoda, chicken, and chorizo tacos. All the meats were pretty good with chorizo being my favorite of the three. I was expecting diced onion and cilantro on the tacos but instead they have a salsa bar with pico. I mixed the pico with the two salsas, it was tasty.<//review>

We got the tacos de bistec and adobada, 2 sides of guacamole, an agua de horchata and an agua de Jamaica. The meat was dry and flavorless. I am Mexican and these tacos put my culture to shame. Maybe I'm spoiled because in San Diego we have great Mexican food all over town. My wife and I were definitely disappointed and surprised with the great reviews this place had. P.s. guacamole was good and my horchata, that's about it.</review>< user>

<Text>This is a great little place in Santa Barbara. We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened and people were already lined up to order.

The food was delicious and very affordable. I had the Alambre de Filette and Pozole ad both were good.

There were so many people eating at the restaurant by the time we left, people were standing around waiting for open tables and for people to leave.

I would definitely visit this place again when I visit Santa Barbara<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

La Super Rica seems to be the most talked-about taqueria in Santa Barbara; whether that talk is positive is a different story.  Some say it is worth the wait.  Some say it's good but you can do better.  Some say it's terrible.  What cannot be disputed is that most people know about it, and that the reviews skew positively.  It is a brighly colored white shack with teal trim, and a line that stretches out the door.  Inside there is a fair amount of seating at basic wooden tables with white chairs.  Service is relatively fast (for Cali at least) as well as friendly, so the line should move fast--except when someone makes a huge order.  Everything--including the tortillas-is made fresh, and the prices are only a little north of what you typically see at taquerias.  Controversy aside, I like the place a lot.  La Super Rica was so good the first time I went, that I came back a second time before my flight back home.  During those 2 visits, I tried the following with overlap: tacos con chorizo, rajas, tacos con bistec, alamore de pechuga, huarache and guacamole.  First off, the homemade tortillas are heavenly; they almost make the restaurant alone.  But there is no doubting the quality of the ingredients used here.  The only issue lies in how they are used sometimes.  The standouts were the rajas in particular.  Maybe it was the seasoning they used, but this combo of cheese and peppers was addictive; combine it with a meat, and you're golden.  The alamore de pechuga/chicken came with peppers and onions, and worked perfectly on the tacos.  The chorizo was greasy and lightly fried in its own fat from its time on the grill, but not as spicy as I would've liked.  Similarly, the tacos con bistec were good but the steak tasted a bit plain compared to other dishes.  The guacamole was great the first time I had it, and just good the second time.  Their salsa bar has 3 salsas: one red, one green and one that is just chopped onions, tomatoes and peppers with cilantro.  Go with the latter, as it is fresh and tasty whereas the other 2 were very muted in their flavors.  The huarache was the best I've had, bar none.< /Text>

< Review>
After hearing and reading all the hype from this place my husband and I (new SB residents)  with my family decided to try this place out. We waited in line for 20+ mins because there's only one person taking orders. After we all ordered it came out close to $85 for 6 of us. Which I personally think was a bit ridiculous. We waited another 20+min for our food. I ordered their pozole and steak Tacos which btw don't come with onion cilantro and lime you have to ask for it. My hubby got their Chile relleno which was the only flavorful thing we all ordered . My parents got the "chorizo" tacos which was really Italian sausage links . So overall of you're expecting your grandma's or mom's style cooking don't come here. It's a very Americanized Mexican food joint. Would I come here again? No.</Review>

Quick Trip up the coast, and decided to re-visit La Super-Rica again.   First visit was around 5 years ago.

The line is still there.....we waited in the hot sun while the line of 20-30 people slowly (very slowly) made its way to the counter to order.    The line seemed to go very slow because half of the people there were out of town (us) tourists (not us) who read about this place on review sites, but were unfamiliar with the food, so they had to pepper the order taker (owner?) with multiple questions before ordering.

Our order was simple -- Pozole, Tamal, and Taco.

Tamal was a bit expensive and mostly dough, but the corn sauce covering it was excellent....you could really taste the fresh corn flavor.

The taco was good....better than most street tacos, but a bit more expensive too.

The pozole was excellent....best I've had for a long time!    Good balance between the hominy, meat, and veggies in perfectly spiced soup.    This made the wait worth it!

So, next time, I'll get the pozole for sure, but will probably pass on the fish tamal and the street taco.< /Text>

I don't understand the hype with this place.  Julia Child endorsed it and now everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and acts as though it's some kind of institution for great Mexican food.  It is one of the worst Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara.  There's nothing special about the food, except that it is bare and unexciting, and the location being five feet from a busy street, with fly-ravaged seating on cheap patio furniture that seldom gets cleaned, under a roof of corrugated plastic, may trick people into thinking it's a locals-only bastion of authentic food, but the food is the worst part.  If you order a carne asada taco, for example, you get a crumbling corn tortilla with a handful of carne asada.  That's it.  Go here if you want a sub-mediocre experience, but don't get suckered in by the hype and believe this is good Mexican food.< /Text>

<review>Los Arroyos is better and I prefer the Rose Cafe on the mesa rather than the one downtown Rose Cafe 2. I'm 12th generation born and raised here in Montecito and my dads mexicano, chicano and my moms jewish, so I have the best of both worlds. Comida De Mexicano is just average here in town because in LA you have the trucks and great places!!! that I go to when I leave paradise here!! my bro's come over to my casa here in Monticeto because my abuelita on my dads side Josephina ran a restaurant in the 1930's and she said that on state street during that period different lamps were placed out front designating what was being served like a green lantern meant "Chlil Verde" and a yellow lantern meant "Carnitas" and all those mole recipes and tacos were passed down and I'm licking my fingers as we speak. Cuca's is totally overrated, most locals don't go there. My grandmothers next door neighbor was Julia Child's here in Montecito and my granny use to go there to La Super Rica a lot with Julia and please don't get me wrong but as soon as the celebrities got the green light,it became nirvana, mistake!!!!! go to the Rose Cafe on the Mesa or Los Arroyo's or even one of the many locations of "Rudy's", like the one on Montecito street and Bath street or upper state. I'm not a tourist and most locals will tell you the best places to go. La Super Rica is quite expensive also, one $ is a misrepresentation! even Steve Martin, Jonathan Winters and other local celebrities frequent the Rose Cafe on the mesa. Bill Clinton ate here at Rose Cafe when campaigning before he became the man!!! and its up on the mesa,away from all the tourist spots. Rudy's is killer the jumbo chicken fajitas burrito is insane,man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the salsa's are picante. mi hambre!!! la semana que entra mi gente's.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The tacos, guacamole, queso fundido, quesadillas, everything handmade and was super delicious. It is no wonder they always have a line but totally worth the wait (which was not long). Will be back for sure, whether we stay in SB or are driving through, found our spot for sure.<//Text>

<time>1556335307100< /time><review>(Translated by Google) Worth waiting for!

The recommended in Forbes Mag Taqueria is only for patient people, after all, we had our food after about 1 hour. We had To Go, as it is much more comfortable on our hotel balcony and not so loud. Noise-sensitive people I recommend doing the same thing.

As had # 1 (4 *) and # 6 (4 5 *) # 12 (5 *) and # 18 (5 *) - the asterisk is subjective as yummie we found it. Remember to pack the tomato salsa / salad, a must to eat - unless you do not like cilantro :-)

Whose long wait is nothing, do not worry - there are many great taquerias who are different but also great.

(Original)
Warten lohnt sich!

Die im Forbes Mag empfohlene Taqueria ist nur für geduldige Menschen, immerhin hatten wir nach ca. 1h unser Essen. Dies hatten wir To Go, da es auf unserem Hotelbalkon deutlich gemütlicher ist und nicht so laut. Lärmempfindlichen Menschen empfehle ich Gleiches zu tun.

Wie hatten Nr. 1 (4*) und Nr. 6 (4 5*) Nr. 12 (5*) und Nr. 18 (5*) - die Sternchen ist subjektiv wie yummie wir es fanden. Denkt daran die Tomatensalsa/salat einzupacken, ein Muss zum Essen - außer ihr mögt keinen Koriander :-)

Wem langes Warten nichts ist, keine Sorge - es gibt viele klasse Taquerias, die zwar anders, aber auch super sind.<//review>< response>
