<Review>My favorite place to find fabric. Each time I go, I have a better experience.  They are knowledgeable about fabric and can answer most questions. I have discovered that I just need to ask what is best for my project or where to find what I want in the store.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>This is a heaven for any seamstress!
The variety of fabrics is wonderful.
Plus the prices are great, it is hard to match around Fresno. Armando is very nice person. He loves his business and his customers and treat us well. Location is easy to find. There is a small parking lot right in front of it.< /text><user_id>106695457248011996242<//user_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEFdRsyZ9g6Qgk8_yEggDMRxW26x1TxfxlLgds=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt3KIhuPs1n4YHGsgUDMnBfLB4grV9SIggWOwJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzX-iqGPo-crRqk03Od4nwLuRN8lapw93cP-bB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg_HNQJPm5NtewgsqNCYWFn9UyoKk581OKH4DB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGoeRG6B28BCSijA80Z-0Nac494F18Am32ef61=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFhF-sYl71E0hWrb2YlYWVfDi14EvBH56J8VwQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODs2FiBQld69O1vYEWhs-bjpqWCOwcTsXxZTZA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< GmapID>

Has lots of inexpensive material. Lots of knits and upholstering. Not much woven fabrics, but they do have some. Great prices though! Most everything is under $5/yd.<//Text>

THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE. Tons of fabric from only $1 a yard. The employees are nice. The only thing I don’t like is the location makes me feel unsafe—I wish they would move.</review>

Great choices and very reasonably priced. I will definitely be going back for anything I need in the future! I was there looking for fabric for my wedding dress that needs to be made custom. Very happy! I still need Organza as that was not available there but I got Satin, Tool, and various other lace material that I couldn't decide on for $112!<//text>

<Text>The first time I came to A & A Textiles was with my mother, she made beautiful curtains for her entire home not to mention for a fraction of what store bought curtains would have costed.
Soo much to choose from at GREAT low price not to mention the staff or (owner)  is very kind and attentive he never seems bothered with any of my mother's or my hundred questions.
Highly recommend A & A Textiles.< /Text>< date>

The only fabric store you'll ever need. Quality fabric, great selection with everything from sheers and silk to heavy upholstery. Insanely affordable and the guy that runs it is nice too.</Review>

Owner is helpful and kind (gives lots of extra fabric on each cut and is very helpful with finding types of fabric and prints). I wish I lived closer!!!! This is an especially good so if you are looking for apparel fabrics (knits, lace, etc).  Fabric is $1-5 for most yardage and specialty lace and velvets go from $7-10. So worth a visit!< /text>< GmapID>

<Time>1587668528523</Time><user_name>Sarah Coombs< /user_name><Text>I'm used to shopping at the big chain stores and wasn't sure what to expect on my first visit to A & A Textiles adorable little "hole-in-the-wall" fabric shop. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place well stocked with a huge variety of fabrics, and the prices are so reasonable (compared to what I am used to paying at JoAnnes) that I can afford to branch out into more sewing projects and have more fun behind my machine! But the thing that really blew me away and made me a lifetime customer was the care they provided to me when the Covid-19 pandemic hit and all the fabric shops closed. I was halfway through sewing a large amount of custom cloth dinner napkins for my upcoming wedding (I had a unique wedding color scheme and opted to sew matching napkins), and I ran out of fabric! I was devastated. I couldn't get any supplies anywhere, and I didn't have enough fabric at home to get the job done in time for my special day. I called A & A Textiles to ask when they would next be open to the public. The person I spoke to on the phone was extremely kind and sympathetic to my situation and arranged to have a gentleman, who I'm assuming was the store manager, meet me outside the closed store to help me acquire the fabric I so desperately needed. Thanks to the amazing level of compassion they showed me I was able to complete all the napkins for my wedding on time. They went above and beyond for me, and I'll never forget it. Thank you A & A Textiles, the best fabric shop in town!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>They have a huge selection and fabrics are stacked floor to ceiling, you will find what you need. The owner is very friendly and knows a lot about fabric, he can help you find what you need right away. Biggest plus, everything is extremely inexpensive and most fabrics will run about 3 dollars a yard, and most specialty fabrics only go up to 10 dollars a yard, if that. Completely recommend!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>I do most of my fabric shopping in the garment district in Los Angeles.  If you have ever shopped there, you will feel right at home in A&A.  Both with the style of selection and the prices. You should probably think of it more as a fabric warehouse instead of a fabric store.  They may not have what you need, but if they do, you will pay less than half what you will anywhere else in Fresno.  They have saved me quite a few trips to LA since they opened.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have shopped here several time for fabric I use on my granddaughter's  costumes and dress-up clothes. The  fabric is beautiful and a fraction of the price of JoAnn's. Actually, the fabric is of a significantly better quality than that sold at JoAnn's. The owner is very helpful and it is obvious he really enjoys what h does.<//review>

<review>The fabrics are great, variety is awesome and the prices can't be beat. As for service, it is generally good but one can't expect multiple employees in a small shop so occasionally I've had to wait. Well worth it.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

There's always something new. I love digging thru the bolts. It's like the table at Hancock fabrics, you never know what treasure fabric you will find. The father and son are very knowledgeable and friendly.</review>

I felt ignored while shopping for fabric. People was being helped first while I was waiting for fabric to be cut. The lady in the store ignored me while helping others who was getting large amounts of fabric. I guess my $50 wasn't good enough!
Other than this, nice prices and their fabrics changes weekly.
The lady that works in the store needs extra help. I walked out due to a wait that lasted over 20 mins.< /text>

I have to say that I'm so happy I found this place. Everytime we go in we're greeted. Even if he's with another client. Helps us alot. Only thing that's saddens me is not alot of fleece material. Also understand it goes by the season.< /text>

<Review>Thanks to Dr. Bhadauria our baby was delivered healthy with no complications. The delivery was fast and she did an amazing job taking care of my wife. If any you are looking for a great OBGYN that will answer all your questions and cares about you and your family Dr. Bhadauria is the Dr. to go to. It took me several days to find the right Dr. for my wife and I’m glad we found her.<//Review>< UserId.>

Dr. Bhadauria is an incredibly kind, and calm OB. I’ve been seeing her for about 14 years now. She delivered my now 5 year old daughter. She was completely on board with my birth plan and I felt very supported. Dr. Bhadauria has such serene energy. I never feel rushed in her office. She’s always answered all of my questions and made me feel very safe. I highly recommend her!</review>

<text>I have had a hard time finding any doctors that I like in LA, especially a Gyno, which is far more personal. I truly cannot thank this team enough. The office is nice and quiet. I feel very respected and taken care of when I visit. They get straight to the point & are very intuitive, caring, and kind. I appreciate this office and Dr Bhadauria very very much. Highly recommend.< /text>< Resp>

<review>She is absolutely amazing! After what seems like hundreds of gynecology visits to many doctors, she is the first doctor to have ever  set up a  plan for me. She is extremely knowledgeable, caring, patient and willing to take the time to answer all of your questions.

<review>My experience with Dr. Bhadauria was really good. She answered all the questions and concerns I had and also provided me some reassurance. In addition, she also told me what the next steps should be. She was patient, attentive and didn’t rush.

My only tip for patients is to make sure you check parking signs if you street park. There is a parking garage below the building that I believe charges 2.50 every 15 minutes (FYI they don't validate).

I felt very comfortable and listened to during the appointment. Dr. Bhadauria has a very calming bedside manner and did not make me feel as though she was rushing through the appointment. I appreciated how quick and easy the examination felt. I am experiencing some delay in getting insurance approval without hearing a lot from the office concerning updates but I know insurance claims can take a while, especially with everything going on.<//Review>

This was my first new patient appt. with Dr Bhadauria for a general pap- and I felt very seen and heard. Great first impression.

Specifically the nurse staff and Dr. Bhadauria were all very personable. They were engaging, made eye contact and I did not feel like just another number/patient.

The appointment ran on schedule (I was early/on time for paperwork) and did not have to wait long before being seen.

The front desk anticipated my needs by offering the location of bathroom if needed.

There were clear instructions, as well as verbal confirmations, about their insurance limitations in regards to in-house or send outs for lab testing.

I did ask the nurse many questions being a new patient in office - and was greeted with clarity and friendliness. Again - frequent eye contact :)

My most beloved take away was Dr. Bhadauria’s calm, sincere, and gentle grounding presence. She also conducted my health history herself, which is rare (and huge!) when you have a lengthy back history like myself. Ive only experienced this attentiveness with holistic doctors. So this dynamic definitely sent the message of  “hands on” care. She was engaging in this regard and I felt very secure knowing the time was being taken to really hear and take notes about my current issues as well as past history and family history.

This also helped alleviate the exhausting process of repeating my health history to one staff member, then another, finally explaining once again to the doctor - and doing so in a summarized fashion feeling rushed.

I’ve had ongoing chronic health issues and infections for upwards 10-12 yrs and as a result have seen and visited a myriad of doctors, specialists and consultants. So I am very familiar with the incredible downsides of the majority of doctor visit morale- ie: rushed appts, limited time with the doctor, emotionally/
mentally checked out staff /doctors, lack of sensitivity or third degree condescending responses, insurance transparencies, front desk disorganization or overt rudeness etc...you name it. Very pleased - this was not the case here.

I left feeling taken care of and confident I have finally found an OBGYN I can feel comfortable seeing in the future and one who wants to get to bottom of things as well.

Fun fact: I also left my cell phone by accident in the exam room and when I came back the receptionist was on a call. She signaled me, and quietly passed my phone over.  Seemless :)</Text>

< Review>
Heather, the one in the reception area is amazing. When I came in, she greeted me with a welcoming smile. She immediately provided me the forms that I need to fill-out, and asked if I needed anything afterwards. After filling up the form, I waited for a little about 5 minutes and the nurse came and assisted me to the examination room. After the nurse did all the prep, Dr. Bhaduaria came with a warm smile( I still see even if she is wearing mask) and warm greetings. She reviewed my medical history, provided information and reminded me the necessary screening for my age. Before doing the procedure, she explained what to expect step bu step. This is very important for the patient as a Gyn exam is not fun. After the exam, Dr. Bhadauria informed me that they will call as soon as the result came in. She also told me that she will give me a referral. The referral was sent to my email which I think is great. Lastly and the most importantly is their timely notification about the result of the exam. We all know that waiting for pending test result is nerve wracking, but Heather did not disappoint. She called me as soon as the result came back, which I really appreciate because I had a bad experience with physicians not calling their patients about an abnormal test results.<//Review>

Dr B is the best doctor I’ve ever worked with in my entire life. While pregnant for the first time, I was overwhelmed with being bounced around from doctor to doctor at cedars Obgyn unit. Once I found out that my baby would be delivered by “whomever was on call” I knew I needed to find someone else who could be there for me through the pregnancy and delivery. I was recommended Dr. B by a friend and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. She guided me through my pregnancy, showed up for me like I was the only patient in the world during delivery and has been with me through the post partum first year. She has a truly magical confident patience and supportive energy. I’m so thankful I had her deliver my baby.<//text>

<review>Amazing doctor! Supportive, listens, and best of all does not impose herself on patients. I went to her in hopes that she would support me through a VBAC as I was looking to get pregnant for the second time. She was supportive, compassionate, and realistic throughout the entire process which I greatly appreciated.< /review>< user_name>

Dr. Bhadauria is the best gynecologist I've had in my adult life. She is caring, thorough, and communicates with her patients well. She has a friendly and professional staff and appointments are prompt and accommodating. Highly recommended!</review>

Facilities are clean and look professional.  Staff is friendly, patient, and helpful.  Email alerts available for appointment reminders and online options are available for accessing test results, contacting the doctor, and scheduling appointments.  Dr. Bhadauria is clearly busy but she never makes me feel like she's in a rush to get me out the door.  She makes it clear that she will gladly answer any questions or concerns that I have when I go in for an appointment, and she has done so in the past when I've had things to talk about with her.</text>

I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Bhadauria. I was referred to her by my PCP and couldn't be more pleased with my first-time visit. She is very warm, friendly and professional. She took her time to answer questions after my visit and thoroughly addressed my personal concerns about fibroid treatment. It was the best experience I've had with an OB/GYN. I highly recommend Dr. Bhadauria!< /Review>

<Review>Dr Bhadauria is always a pleasure to see.  She is gentle, supportive, empathetic and smart.  Having pap smears is something I definitely don't enjoy and having her do them makes what is not enjoyable actually oddly enjoyable if that makes sense.
Her staff are also wonderful.  Thank you for being there especially during covid.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great bedside manner and took her time to answer all my questions and concerns. Switching OBs at 23 weeks was a huge concern for me but she made it easy and helped me and my baby feel comfortable. They answer the phone quickly and the receptionist is very nice and welcoming; Covid-safe, clean, and efficient office (mask and temp check required). Did not wait long to see Dr Bhadauria (in fact, I was still filling out my paperwork when I was called into the room)!<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

It takes so long to find an MD in LA that doesn't make everything about them. It costs nothing to be just kind & nice and Dr. Bhadauria has the  best bedside manner as an ob/gyn. She asked about stress! Most MDs go through the motions quickly in an arrogant manner because you're not their celeb client. A shame that finding a decent dr. like Sushma is the anomaly and not the norm.</review>

Just from walking in and getting a Hello says a lot about a Doctors office.  I was greeted by I believe her name was Judy, it was my first time there and she walked me thru what I had to sign. They took me in pretty quick and was seen by Doctor Bhadauria. I like that she explained what was going on with my pregnancy.  She sits down and talks to you, and explains what’s going on.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Bhadauria is the best OB/GYN doctor in Los Ángeles. I’ve been going to her since my first high risk pregnancy with twins in 2018. Thanks to my husband  who really took days researching for the right doctor we were able to find her. She’s  very professional and friendly. I’m so thankful for her because she always answers my questions and really takes the time with her patients. Dr. Bhadauria shows a lot of compassion towards every patient she sees on a daily basis. If I have Any questions after hours she always answers my text or calls. My second pregnancy was very smooth thanks to her professionalism and care I was Able to get through a smooth delivery with my daughter. I live In the Inland empire and take the 2 hour drive to Los Ángeles because it’s really worth it. If you’re looking for a great doctor... she’s the one no doubt. Very thankful for her and all her friendly staff.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

Dr. Bhadauria is my OB/GYN during both of my pregnancies. I can surely say she is the best doctor/Gyne that I had experience with. She is very very professional and answers all your conerns properly.She has been my OBGYN for years, and delivered our baby girl two years ago and currently I am seeing her for my second one. Her patience, kindness, intellect, and responsiveness made me visit her during my second pregnancy as well though her office was little far from my house, still I wanted to have myself checked up by her only.. Unlike other OB/GYN she never scares a pregnant women for small complications.  She is always prompt about returning phone calls and makes you feel understood and cared for. I would definitely recommend her to every women in LA looking for OB/GYNE. The best best Dr. :)< /Review>

She is an amazing and very caring doctor for her patients. She is always available a call away.I did my VBAC successfully with her help and she was with me during my labor which happened on long weekends and in the midnight. The job she was doing is really respectful.Lucky to have her as a doctor. Would recommend !!<//Review>

Great experience! No wait time, and Dr. Bhadauria was lovely. She was professional, gentle, non-judgmental and had wonderful bedside manner--everything I look for in a doctor. I really felt like she took her time answering all my questions, I didn't feel rushed at all. Would recommend!</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>She’s good when you’re in front of her but there’s zero response rate from her office when you have medical questions. I’m 5 months pregnant so when there are health issues it’s a bigger deal. When I had symptoms of bronchitis no one called me back even though I left three imploring messages with the assistants. When I got sick from the antibiotics to treat the bronchitis, no one called me back. It’s really unprofessional and frustrating and borderline negligent.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

<review>Dr Sushma Bhadauria is one of the most sweet and most caring doctors I have been to. Never rushes us and always answers my wife’s questions, all 100 of them, each visit.
We feel so lucky to have her as my wife’s ob !!<//review><gmapID>0x80c2b93f0e6ff31d:0x5c38f4d1af22bfab< /gmapID><response>None</response>< Name>

<review>Dr. Bhadauria is amazing!! She delivered my first-born and I could not have done it without her support and service. She is not only highly professional but you could also tell, from the first time you meet her that she genuinely cares for the betterment of her patients. I can go on and on about all the great things she has done for me and my family. Even if I move to another city, I would come back to her for my second delivery, now that is how much I LOVE her.</review><Date>1516897938300< /Date>< user_name>

< Review>
Dr. Bhadauria has helped me many times and has a demeanor that really makes me feel comfortable.  Highly recommend her- and I do to all my girlfriends. Everyone at the office is kind. Aside from being jealous of all the pregnant women (lol) I enjoy my experience as much as one can.  Wouldn't want to go to anyone else!< /Review>

Amazing doctor!

Went back 40 miles to be her patient again.
An OB you can trust yourself and your unborn child without any hesitation.< /Review>

My first appointment with Dr. Bhaduaria was July 2018.  I had avoided seeing a doc for a few years after a negative experience with a male gyno.  She was caring, thoughtful, gentle and described everything she was doing before and during the exam.<//review>

We relocated to California & I've been seeing Dr. Bhadauria since 20wks pregnant with my 2nd child. They made the process so smooth with transferring my health records. Dr. Bhadauria is such a pleasure every single appointment. She addresses any concerns or questions you may have, gives you her personal cell to be reached at all times, & truly cares for the patient. I absolutely have fallen in love with her & would highly recommend her to any expecting mother. The staff are always friendly and great with answering the phone/returning calls.<//Text>

I am or WAS a new patient BUT today I am horrified because I just got my insurance break down of costs and Dr. Bhadauria charged me 500.00 to my insurance for a pap smear and lab tests.To me this is very expensive. My insurance break down and they have it as being 800.00. This is the state of medicine in America? The doctor with the calm bedside manner is over charging insurance and the insurance companies are over charging us / me theconsumer? The vicious cycle is perpetual. The cost of medicine is exorbitant because "THEY CAN DO AS They PLEASE" there is zero oversight and the scared Hypocratic oath was long forgotten. It breaks my heart because I was looking for a great doctor and enjoyed S. Bhadaurias bedside manner but her greed has turned me off. If you care about ethical treatment and ethical practices you may try someone else. I am disgusted and disappointed. How can we remedy the sick medical industustries greed?  By rufusing to frequent unethical greedy over charging doctors. That is how demanding better services at realistic prices. What we pay in America is false and inflted perpetuated by doctors and our insurance companies, shame on them.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) When I arrived at Dr. Shusma's office with my pregnancy I felt very scared because it was my first pregnancy. She had the patience to explain everything to me, to make me feel safe and take care of my baby. There will never be a smile on her face, she always has patience, time, desire to see you, for me she is the best doctor in the world. The most important thing was at the time of scheduling my delivery, I wanted to be a C-section because of fear, she told me that all my conditions were for normal delivery, I refused until one day she looked me in the eye, she asked me what my Real fears, I cried, I told them, took my hands and told me to trust, that everything would be fine, I promised and fulfilled. My delivery was normal, wonderful and she was always there at all times, she felt as happy as I was that we had achieved it together. Today my baby is four months old and healthy! I thank God for having put Dr. Sushma, Janeth and Cindy (part of his team) on my way. Do not worry if you do not speak English, they will help you in Spanish too ❤️ Infinite thanks Dr. Sushma will always carry it in my heart and in my memory, thank you for making me discover my strengths.

(Original)
Cuando llegué a la oficina de Dr. Shusma con mi embarazo sentí mucho miedo porque era mi primer embarazo. Ella tuvo la paciencia de explicarme todo, de hacerme sentir segura y de cuidar de mi bebé. Jamás faltará una sonrisa en su rostro, siempre tiene paciencia, tiempo, ganas de verte, para mi es la mejor doctora del mundo. Lo más importante fue en el momento de programar mi parto, yo quería ser cesárea por miedo, ella me indicó que todas mis condiciones eran para ser parto normal, yo me negaba hasta que un día me miró a los ojos, me preguntó cuáles eran mis reales miedos, lloré, se los dije, tomó mis manos y me dijo que confiara, que todo estaría bien, me lo prometió y cumplió. Mi parto fue normal, maravilloso y ella siempre estuvo en todo momento, se sentía tan Feliz como yo de que lo hayamos logrado juntas. Hoy mi bebé tiene cuatro meses y está sano! Le doy gracias a Dios por haberme puesto en mi camino a Dr. Sushma, a Janeth y Cindy (parte de su equipo de trabajo). No te preocupes si no hablas inglés, ellos te van a ayudar en español también ❤️ Gracias infinitas Dr. Sushma la llevaré siempre en mi corazón y en mi memoria, gracias por hacerme descubrir mis fortalezas.</Review>

I'm a very satisfied customer. I have all my insurance policies and needs covered. My personal agent Jill Washington is always available to meet or talk. I can guarantee you won't get a pre-recorded menu, you talk to an actual person in thier office.

Thank you</text>

We have dealt with Allstate since 2001 and continue to have excellent service with our home and vehicles. We have filed various claims and have been well taken care of fairly and promptly. I recommend Allstate to all my friends and family<//Review>

Jill Washington is the best, because she actually finds your need and matches you with the best policy options.  I saved over $150 per month with better auto coverage.  Thanks again Jill.< /Text>

Monique was the greatest, she really made us feel at home and was very patient as well. If u need insurance of any kind go to Allstate on Pacific Ave and ask for Monique, she's the bomb.

<Review>So I went to buy a raspado at this place because they are good however when I got there I opened the door and this young lady screamed at me “no puede entrar “ “you can’t come in” I just told her sorry and stepped out but she never asked me if I needed help or to place my order. I waited outside and she never came outside to take my order, another man came after me and she helped him right away. Just bad service and this lady was very rude. I will never buy from you guys again ever!! There’s better places with good customer service not rude like your employees.</Review>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><Pics>None</Pics><review>(Translated by Google) A chilindrina does not carry everything in excess ... they put everything in excess, little cabbage tomato ... everything is too much and the chicharon is watered down ... if they could fix the chicharon in moderation it would come out much better.

(Original)

Bob was honest, straightforward, and fair.  He called me before any extra repairs he suggested to explain why. He also gave me detailed pricing for each repair before making them.  After the repairs were finished, he showed me the broken parts to further explain why they needed to be replaced.

I can't ask for anything more from a mechanic.  I will use Boyd's exclusively for any repairs.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Boyd's is as honest as they come. I've had the owner advise me on how I could get different parts for some repairs. Air compressors are not cheap.
They do detailing, bodywork and maintenance so they're really a one stop shop.
They provide a drop off to your office if you are within range.
they are in constant demand so make sure to call ahead and try to make an appointment a few days in advance.
If you're nice, the owner might give you one of their on-site grown Persian lemons :)<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs_1aiI_kUEnurBW1V9YGdK_scspi6ldzSlNhu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4WGhU-FTdVwplYzvv9H9gV9ZdgkRWxGP45mgb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

My car was hit while parked, resulting in a dent and surprisingly extensive paint damage on two panels. They fixed my car in 5 days, which is exactly how long they said it would take. Only went over quote by about $50. They did a basic interior and exterior cleaning of the car before returning it to me, which was much appreciated. Hopefully no one else hits my car, but if they do, I will use Boyd's again.<//Review>

Less than half the total cost of the “estimate” of the this place. Hate to leave such a bad review but also have to be honest and let people decide the fate of their cars for themselves. Good luck.

I did my car maintenance estimate at Berkeley at $800 and they said it’s $5000. Just imagine how much money they will charge you if it’s your insurance and your insurance will eventually increase and only for inspection they charge me $100. Lesson learn though.

Great work, good price and they really went the extra mile for me! I've been to about a dozen body shops in the bay area through the years and Boyd's is top notch. Flawless paint match and body work. I'll never go to another body shop. 10/10.</text>

This post is long overdue: Bob and the guys at Boyd's have been fixing my 4 runner over the four years since moved to the East Bay. I tried other shops when I came out here but there is noone I trust more for a good deal and great service. They have helped me through two major wrecks and always get my car back to me looking better than it was before.</review>

Bob at Boyd's and his crew always deliver great service at hard to beat prices. I was recently referred here to fix my struts and he was able to provide me a quote then and there that was half of the price to where I was previously was taking my car to. They were also able to look at any of the other issues I brought to their attention, so yeah, Bob will always take care of your car and you! Now I'm like I wish I knew of this place sooner.<//Review>

Best place around to get repairs of any kind done on your car. You can’t beat their prices and they do very good work. Each time I’ve gone I’ve gotten a quote quickly on the spot and my car was done in a few days. Highly recommended!<//review>

This is the best bodyshop at the East Bay! Bob and Ramon are really cares about you and your car. They repaired my car after the accident last year. And now when it was some problems with the suspension they were testing it couple of times and replaced the defective part under their warranty! Wonderful guys! Five stars! I'd like to give them even ten stars!<//text>

< review>
I took my car to Boyd's for what appeared to be a radiator leak.  He told me they would inspect it, find what the problem was, and call me.  They looked at it, called me and told me I would need a New Radiator, and a new Thermostat.  They also told me my Coolant Sensor was bad, and needed to be replaced.  I authorized the repairs.  The repairs were done on time-  I was concerned about this, because I had to be at work in mid-afternoon.  The work was done on time, and he also gave me a big break on the cost of the parts.
Now, here is the bottom line:  the work was done in a timely, very professional way.  My car has not run this way in a long time.  I believe the car computer was running in a different mode, because of the faulty Coolant Sensor.  My very rough idle is gone, the car has a lot more power (it wants to get up and go now) and has  better gas mileage.
I would recommend Boyd's to anyone that wants quality work done at a reasonable price.  Go by and look at their parking lot.  You will find it very full, all the time.  They would not have all these cars if they did not do  good quality work, at a reasonable price.
Unfornatuately, I do not work up here in this area anymore.  I will drive the 50 miles, to bring my car in for repairs to Boyd's.  My sister's truck is running really bad.  I am working on it so we can drive it to Boyd's to have them find out what is wrong with it.  If not, I am going to have it towed to Boyd's.
I am completely 100% sold on Boyd's and would recommend them to anyone.  Floyd<//review>

This place is the only one in the bay area I found to be honest, professional and affordable. Because the service is good it is usually at full capacity and things can take more time than in other places. Still worth waiting the extra time.</text>

(1) When I got my car, it had a huge crack on my front windshield, a flat tire, and my car was parked "on the street".  The owner, Bob, responded: There was already a windshield chip, and the sun/heat made the chip crack. Bob was foreign from the middle east so I assume that was the reason he talked slowly & nicely.

However, at this moment, he talked fast and mean saying, "You go check the milage of your car, there's not even 1mi added!"  I noticed he was holding my car keys tighter, so I knew I wouldn't get my car back to work unless I paid him.  So he got it his way.

(2) Bob charged me storage fee but actually kept customers' cars on the st.  This is a small shop, yet it's in an unsafe area.  So they move customers' cars to the street after they fix them.

(3) They estimated 3 days to fix my bumper, but it took 7 days, causing car rental cost double....and what's better for them, they charged me STORAGE FEE using public streets!  I went to 3 other car shops nearby, they had less cars getting fixed than Boyd's, but they told me between 3~5 days.  I wish I had had chosen those shops.

Bonus:
After I paid Bob, he recommended a glass shop owned by his friend to fix my windshield.  Bob specifically wanted me to tell the shop he referred me, and I will get a discount.  ... Another scam?

Later, I went to a different shop, the manager there said my windshield crack was actually caused by dropping some sharp heavy metal on my  windshield.  I do NOT recommend this shop !!!< /text><gmapID>0x80857e684505c7e9:0x7c8c970f6e0eb7d2< /gmapID><userid>104420951178203351839< /userid></record></dataset><record>

They are so friendly! The tea is brewed right when you order, so you know it's fresh.

They also sell Sight Glass coffee which is really high quality.

Best tea shop in town.< /Text>

Wow! Best boba in Redding. Delicious fresh teas - we ordered three different teas - lavender, earl grey, and dirty chai - and all were exceptionally good. Super friendly service on a hot day too.</Text>

It was tucked away and probably completely underrated because so but between the good drink, friendly staff and overall feel, I liked it. I felt the guy working was completely knowledgeable and friendly when asked about carbs in the drink. The place is clean and modern and I like how they offer board games to play with your friends/family.< /Text>

Great place!!! Was lucky enough to talk to the owner. Very nice man!!! I am kind of new to the Boba Tea thing, he was wonderful and explained the different teas, shakes and drinks they have. Had the best pumpkin spiced latte with boba today!!! Will definitely be going there again and anytime I am in Redding. Amazing place!!!!< /text>

<Review>Pretty good and interesting coffee place rather than the original Dutch Bros or Starbucks options. However. It takes them Alot longer to make their coffees. I've gone two seperate times and both workers took about 15- 20 minutes  for 2 drinks. Witch is fine for me but maybe not someone in a rush or time limit. Also the iced coffees don't have much ice because the hot Expresso makes it melt so it almost makes your drink immediately watered down. Coffee is delicious though</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Fantastic new Boba Tea Shop in Redding. Really friendly patrons, great prices and great boba.

Have fantastic deals and great options. I got the  Thai IceTea and it amazing and very flavorful. I also tried the Chai with Boba and that too was amazing.

Would highly recommend to try these guys out.</Text>

I found Earths Elements by chance, on my way to the beach. Everything about this place radiates positive energy!

First, I was greeted by Claudia, whose warmth and welcoming spirit I could feel from across the room. I also met with Ivan, who kindly showed me the little studio upstairs where they host sound baths and other classes.

They have a great selection of crystals too! I love the little cards that accompany them, which describe the healing properties along with the corresponding chakras (a nice touch, if you’re getting these as gifts, which I was at the time).

As I took my time selecting crystals, Claudia and Ivan would gently and humorously check in to see if I needed anything. And the crystals I finally selected ended up being the perfect gift for my friend, who just kept exclaiming how much she loved them and how they were exactly what she needed. :)

I’m just so happy I found this gem of a place. Such lovely people and vibes! Thank you, Claudia and Ivan! I will be returning here often.<//review>

I ran into this place randomly on vacation & not only is it beautiful, the cashier is very knowledgeable and reached out to give me the spiritual advice I know I needed without me even asking!

You can feel the positive vibes as soon as  you walk in. They have a great and unique selection, the prices are reasonable for the pieces they sell. There is a wellness area as well where on select days they have classes and meditation sessions.

The workers are very knowledgeable and open. Their energy is consistent. This is a great healing shop.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Ivan was super nice and helpful on which stones to buy for my needs and gave me lots of information on their wellness center and amazing products.

I absolutely love this place. I used to live in Hermosa, but I moved to the east coast. I still visit Hermosa often and every time I am in town I come here for the amazing meditation classes, aura cleanses, or for crystals and other items. I wish this place of calm and healing existed when I lived here, but happy that it exists now. The employees are very knowledgeable and intuitive. The people who teach the classes etc are gifted. I leave this placed relaxed and more knowledgeable then when I came in.<//Review>

We love earths elements.absolutely love the man who works there and Miranda and have had amazing vibes and energy. We also found our amazing massage therapist here.today the energy was dark and awful.the woman working was not friendly and was uncomfortable being in there and she also was not very nice.i love to support local small businesses especially metaphysical shops as I'm in the same field.i will be back but will have to check who is working.we didn't feel welcomed in there at all today.<//text>

Earth’s Elements is a beautiful escape from the world whenever you walk in it is like time stops. Everyone there is very welcoming and helpful, and the aura the store emits is positive, and refreshing. I can’t get enough of this store I always wish I could stay longer.

When he opened I had a nice chat with him I went couple of times afterwards and bought some candles and incense. Lady who worked there was in a rush! I checked and everything I purchased is much cheaper online through direct websites of these products.< /text>

I lovedddddd the aura cleanse that I got from Jacklyn. She helped me release so much energy that wasn't serving me, activated my divinity, and shined a light on all areas that I needed to heal in my life. Left feeling so relaxed, at peace, and knowing my divine purpose and what I should be doing in this world! Healers helping other healers, truly a very gifted woman!< /Text>

This place is filled with good energy and is a perfect way to destress from the day to day agendas in the relaxing environment. The meditations are very effective and enlightening. As if that wasn’t good enough the staff is very friendly and have endless qualities that make them wonderful in there own ways. Kelly is the best though what a queen.❤️</text>

<Review>Walked by and the musical meditation with the bowls caught my eye. I was able to get into the class last minute and a yoga mat was provided. I ended up sitting next to a girl who was from the same city as me on her own journey as well. The class was lovely and the shop is amazing with so many wonderful things and every! They even offered a 10% discount for the summer solsitic today! 6/21/19 can’t wait to travel back here!!</Review>< pictures>

Kelly in earths elements was sooo amazing to us to help us decide on which crystals to buy and find which crystal was which one! She let us play the singing bowls and just breathe/take a break from life in this little store. The positive vibes in here are soooo strong! I recommend stopping by even if it is for 5 minutes. Your day with totally change in a positive way!< /text>

So Happy to have found this amazing spot,l. With crystals you’re looking for an instant connection and feeling and this place I get both! Went here for the crystals but will be back for the wide variety of classes and mediations sessions. Super friendly staff and huge, well priced selection of crystals!<//Review>

<Text>I have been coming to Earth’s Elements since moving to the South Bay last summer. This beautiful sanctuary is a place to come and feel reenergized. I come regularly for the tea products they offer which I can’t find anywhere else. After my first visit I became a repeat customer and fall in love with the chakra balancing products, the healing crystals and the books offered to increase my spiritual knowledge. Not only is this store front unique, there are healing members here that offer sound meditation, reiki healing, vision board classes and all around wellness. I can’t speak higher of this peaceful place, after meeting Claudia, an angel who offers her service to this place and took the time to share her story, I will be back for her energy healing classes. Many thanks, much love to Earths Elements!! Namaste<//Text>< pics>

<text>This store was such a breath of fresh air, I feel like i came back from a vacation. Hearing a singing bowl being played while I was looking around was sooo refreshing and a great experiance. I planned on just going in and looking for 5-10 min. Which lead to 1 and a half hours and a few purchases. I highly reccommend going in! Thank you Kelly for showing me around and letting me know about upcoming events!<//text>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This store has such high vibes! The staff are so friendly~ Much love to Rebecca, Kelly and Olivia 💚They have a special space upstairs, a beautiful healing room for their Sound baths and other events that are posted to the MindBody app. Check out Rebecca’s kundalini class and definitely enjoy a Sound Bath there with crystal singing bowls. CBD products are amazing and I can never leave without a crystal calling me! If you’re like me, you won’t want to leave this store, chatting with the awesome staff and just soaking up all the high vibes!! You’ll leave energized but calm and positive. What a blessing it is to have this space now in Hermosa!</Review>< pics>

Outdoor patio open. Nice ambiance. Attentive and attractive wait staff. Really good sushi rolls. Fairly priced drinks. Like all bars, could use a "heavier" pour. I like my drinks like I like my men...< /Review>

Great and friendly staff. Great food when I visit for lunches. The menu has been revamped serveral times and always good in my opinion. Friendly atmosphere. Sometimes it gets a bad rep on weekends because shady people show up, but overall, always fun when I'm there drinking, eating, and playing pool.<//review>

< Review>
I called in a order, my fiancé went to go pick it up. He asked one person if it was ready, they said they’d go check; never came back. He waited some more for like 30 mins & asked someone else & it was ready! Looked like it had been ready & sitting there! The guacamole was turning brown, unacceptable!! & we drove from Tulare to get it, never again!<//Review>

They have updated their patio with a bar and TV's, it's very nice. Food is always on point, 007 roll is a must! I can't say enough about the service. Highly recommend.< /text>

<Review>The feminine guy gave horrible rude costumer service over the phone. When asked what does your fried sushi roll have in it? He told me to go to the menu online because were too busy here it’s lunchtime. That’s understandable if you’re busy all he had to say can you wait and I would’ve waited. I was trying to make a pick up order. Never been to that place and never will go now.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

When we walked in we were intimidated by the  crowd of people here on this NFL Sunday and we still received great service.  I have to say Val was our waiter today and he did outstanding job serving us. He was very attentive to our table and made sure our glasses were always full. We truly appreciated the awesome service and delicious food!!<//Review>

Nice clean sports bar. It is laid out quite nicely with plenty of large screens for watching games. Also a very nice area to play pool and socialize. The restraunt Serbs quality food. Prices are mid range. The employees and staff are really nice, making you feel right at home. JV.<//Review>

<text>They have a great sushi bar & amazing BBQ menu plus other foods. So there's something for everyone on the menu.
They have 8 very nice pool tables. They serve 20 beers on tap, a modern photo booth. A modern juke box. This venue is TOP NOTCH, no expense was spared in making this place beautiful.

The night scene there is better now too. They have 2+ security guards and they're doing a great job keeping it wholesome.

Check this place out for yourself before you judge it. I personally love this place.

I've been teaching painting classes there and everyone loves this location.<//text>< name>

My wife and I ate here and had a blast! Unlike most sushi places here in town, Fifth Quarter gives you more bang for your buck! Our amazing server, Val, made sure our cups were filled, offered our drinks to go, and even ran out to give us our keys back rather than us having to back in for them. This is my wife's favorite sushi place, and mine too!</text>

My first experience started out great but rapidly declined. Drinks $6 a cocktail! Wow I thought I was in heaven. Then it changed to $8 within a couple of weeks. Certain bartenders charge a different price for same drink. Didn’t like it but liked the place so let it go. Tonight, a different bartender and manager I haven’t seen before. Now we are up to $10 , same drink. This is all within a month. Now I am upset. Explained other bartender and manager are charging me $6-8. Told her she could not do that. Has to be consistent. She said too bad and charged me anyway. I told her she lost a customer, no tip. What the hell?<//review>

<Review>The 5th quarter owners need to realize they have a nice bar and restaurant. The food is good but they dont have enough staff in kitchen. The cooks do a good job of making food, but I bet the guys need more staff to get the food out faster. I only ever see 2 guys working, impossible to keep up. The waitresses do their best but take a lil long to get drinks to you. The owner needs to see they need some more workers, the food is good. Just takes too long to get it, and ur drinks. Will try again in a few weeks.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80952f245512da83:0x1e93710e9ae998d< /gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< date>

Gave this place another try after having bad service 5 months ago and I'm so glad I DID!  We had excellent service and the new menu is so yummy. Ash was our server and he was wonderful. They have made so many changes for the better. We will absolutely be returning.< /text>

We sat down and waited for 10 minutes to even be noticed. We had to ask for menus and then we sat for another 15 minutes and no one came to even greet us or ask for our drinks. We got up and walked out. Very poor service 0/10 would not recommend.<//Review>

Great place to play pool and hang with my guys. Music was good. After 10pm it turns more into a club seen and I don't care for that. At 9 pm security comes by asking for Id for the club. The kitchen closes at 9pm also so when we left we headed to another restaurant for food.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I had to at least give 1 star I would rather give this place 0 stars.this place promotes underaged drinking.my 18 year old daughter who turned 18 in may of this year who is still going to high school was allowed into this place when it turns into a night club on the weekends.she got in because of her relationship with the bouncer.i talked to the management 2 separate times they never got back to me once either phone call or text or email.to let me know what they did to stop my daughter from coming into there business.so as you can see don't give this place your business and what ever you do don't take your children here.<//text><time>1540340612757< /time>< response>

Very good sushi and a nice place to kick back with friends and family to shoot some pool or watch a sports game.  Their bar has great service and prices are what you would expect from a premium sports bar.  The nightclub during the evening sucks because the DJ is terrible but I still love this place nonetheless.< /Text>

Great food and restaurant but club hours are insane unsafe and full of drugs and gang members cops are there every weekend. Might as well have a new police substation there. I Was just there the past 2 weekends both On Friday nights and to many people there feel entitled. Drugs going on left and right in the bathroom and fights almost guaranteed every weekend to my wife and I will never be attending that place again< /Review>

< review>
I was really excited to try this place out, it seemed like a really cool concept! We were first asked to change tables because the one we sat at was dirty (the guy had a rag in his hand) but no big deal we moved. It took about 20 minutes before our drink order was taken, and then we ordered apps. They delivered them, and then tried delivering the same apps like 7 other times and we had to keep telling them they were delivering to the wrong table. At one time the waiter set down an app and then took it away when another waiter told him it was at the wrong table. We ordered another round of drinks and they brought the wrong drink and didn’t notice it until I mentioned it. The wait time was horrible and we had a horrible experience which lead to no tip. I walk back in to get something off of the table and the entire staff are talking about the fact we left no tip in front of the other customers. I understand employment issues happen and you’re short staffed, but c’mon.</review>

< review>
Friendly employees. Great food.  Alot of space threwout.  Outdoor coutyard for smokers or out door eating on a nice day, And a games too, (corn hole outside) Full of pool tables, pong table, ect inside.  Nightlife covers a variety depending on what night u go.  Big dance floor, with enough room around the bar for those who drink.  Probably the biggest place without feeling crowded in visalia that has dancing in visalia.Probkem is if the DJ crew doesn't like someone they will take pictures of you and post on social media with rude comments.  I have the pictures for proof.  Just be done by 10pm. Otherwise nice place.</review>

<text>One of my favorite places to eat in Visalia. The sushi here is amazing, the Pho is outstanding, their Brisket and Pulled pork sandwiches are to die for!
Good environment to bring your family for a good dinner and a few drinks.
I hear that after 10pm it gets crazy since they turn it into a club, but I've never been. So as long as you go before 10pm you are okay 😜👌<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
This place is to go hook up with straight people and do/buy drugs. Worst places to go on a Wednesday night. Known as the gay night. Music is the worst I ever heard. If you boyfriend/husband wants to go here think twice and keep your eyes open you will see what I'm talking about.  "Bartenders are the nieces people there."<//Review>

Good food, but they need to bring DJ TCosta to mix Saturday nights. He's really good and the young dj in the Central Valley to dj in clubs. BRING HIM!!<//Text>

For my first time ever being at the 5th Quarter, I got to say it is poppin here. I love the whole atmosphere here.  The music is off the chain. The DJ really knows his music, and what people like. All in all it was a great experience here at the 5th Quarter. I guess this is going to be our new spot to come to on Fridays WOOP-WOOP YEAH!!!</Review>

After a day of races and winning hundreds of dollars... this isn't the place to go.. but if you lost and need as stiff cheap drink,  you could your place... it's usually packed. But always fun...</Text>

The live band is awesome. If you want to listen to some great blues music in a small, casual bar,this is the place. The drinks are always good.</Review>

<Review>Randomly stopped in to kill some time with a cocktail. Decent prices, friendly staff. Crowd is a little wonky/older so if you're looking for a club environment this isn't the spot for you. But if you're lookin for a dark place to have a cocktail and chill in the corner you'll be right at home.</Review>< time>

Ole faithful...First Cabin Bar never let's me down.  It's the "neighborhood" bar where you're most likely to run into people you know.  Great jukebox, pool table, foosball (sp?), and friendly bartenders.  I used to come here all the time and I'm feeling this void in my life...I think I need to go to First Cabin Bar.  Pete J. (aka Mayor of WAMA) when is the next town meeting??< /Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>What a great bar.  I travel 10 months a year and have the opportunity to experience quite a few establishments in a miriad of cites and this one is one of the best.  The staff is courteous and the band, oh my the band was very good.  The only reason I didn't rate the First Cabin a five is the fact that is a bit small.  I felt like I was in a cave but the rest of the experience certainly made up for its size.  Yes if you get a chance you have to check out the First Cabin.  Thanks to the staff who made me feel like a regular.<//Review>< response>

And, Pat O'Brien & The Priest's of Love (who play every Thurs, Fri & Satrdy) are unbelievably amazing. Come w a few extra $5 bills for a cash request & they'll amaze you with, not only their own 8 albums worth of songs, but also covers on Led Zeppelin, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrixy... Many more. &Pat plays it beautifully. If ya like dive bars &/or like great live music, check this spot out.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great people
Day time catch up on events from Santa Anita or the friendly conversation with locals or even the great bartenders have some interesting stories.  Been a regular for about 8 years now it's awesome warming place to be. At night, Wednesday is 80's rock starting at 9pm, the Cabin Fever band with Jimmy Volpe A must see. Thursday thru Saturday is Pat O'Brien and the Priests of Love, good blues / claasic rock for a fix of Jimi, Stevie Ray, and original blues.  if your a smoker there's now  a smoking area in back , if you're a non smoker no more going home smelling like an ashtray.   Hope your experience is as wonderful as mine.   Have fun, Cheers........🍸🍺🍻🍷🍹< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Before ordering wine, the bartender will ask if you need "Open a tab", which means to keep the bill for you. If you are not only having a drink, then you can directly pass the credit card to him and tell him your name. Remember that the name must be the same as the name on the credit card. When you wait for the next glass of wine, tell him what your name is. The waiter will charge the fee from your credit card. Just go to "Close the tab" before you leave. Of course, in addition to using a credit card, cash can also be used to pay the bill. Don't worry that the bartender can't remember your name, they are very professional. If it is a bar with a lot of people, you may be given a number, and you only need to report the number to order. Speaking of wine, if you choose beer, most Bars will have their own beer selection. There are a variety of barrels of loose beer, which is directly connected to the tap. This is called "Beer on tap", except for For a cup, you can also choose to have a pitcher. This type of beer is generally at a good temperature, and you can taste a few more. Some beer bars will change the wine halfway. There are many choices. It is best to start with the lightest beer. Most light-colored beer will taste a little lighter, even It is fruity, but the safest way is to ask the waiter. There are many types of beer in the United States, mainly divided into two categories, Ale and Lager. Ale is top-level fermentation and belongs to high-temperature fermentation, while Lager is bottom-level low-temperature fermentation and has a lighter color. Most beers currently on the market belong to Lager.

首先点酒之前，酒保都会问一下是否需要“Open a tab”，这个意思就是为你保留一下账单，如果你不仅喝一杯的话，那么你可以直接把信用卡递给他，然后告诉他你的名字，记住名字要和信用卡上的名字保证一致。等点下一杯酒的时候，直接告诉他你叫什么，服务员会从你的信用卡上划走这笔费用，走之前去“Close the tab”就可以了。当然除了使用信用卡，现金也可以付账，不用担心酒保记不住你的名字，人家可是专业的很。如果是人比较多的Bar，可能会给你一个号码，点酒只需要报号码就可以。说到点酒，如果是选择啤酒的话，多数Bar里会有自酿的啤酒选择，有多种桶装散啤，就是直接拧开水龙头接的那种，这里叫做“Beer on tap”，除了要一杯，你还可以选择要一扎（Pitcher）。这类的啤酒一般温度适宜，还可以多品尝几种，有的啤酒吧还会中途换酒，选择很多，最好从最淡的啤酒喝起，大多数浅色的啤酒味道会淡一点，甚至带点果香，不过最保险的方式还是问一下服务生。美国的啤酒分类很多，主要是分为两大类，Ale和Lager，Ale为顶层发酵，属于高温发酵，而Lager属于底层低温发酵，颜色较淡，目前市面出售的多数啤酒属于Lager。< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I received notice that I owe them money and after contacting the creditor directly and finding out I do not have a balance with them. I contacted Progressive Management Services and after speaking to Mary who was very rude and refused to help me with this account and even hung up on me. I believe strongly that this company is a scam as they can not provide any information. After reading the other reviews I'm even more convinced that this is the case. Good luck to anyone who has to work with this company.< /Review>< user_name>

This company is a SCAM . My poor husband has Parkinson and dementia and a man from their office called and told him he had to pay $50 right now.  The account he was supposedly collecting has been paid since Sept 9,2020 . I guess they were getting him to pay someone else's  account.  But he collected $50.I have been calling them and the company that was paid has sent them the information that it was paid in full but they still won't return our money. If these people call you BE CAREFUL THEY ARE SCAMMERS<//Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>These people are clueless and do not listen to what you tell them.  My collection was for the department of labor not paying for a CT Scan when I was injured working with the post office.  I explained this to them and gave them the number to that office as well as the workers comp office to explain to them that I am not liable for this debt.  I asked them to stop calling me....they did not.  I still get a call every day, three times a day.  It has turned into harassment at this point. I have been nice, but that is no longer going to happen.  My claim is finally going to be paid after almost two years of fighting our government for it!< /Review>< pictures>

I understand that they are debt collectors, but its interesting how malicious they can be on the phone. They will talk over you, cut you off, and give you a lot of attitude even if you ask the most basic questions. I guess if you are a business who needs debt collection services this would suit you well. Only problem is that those customers who may have forgotten to pay a bill and had no intent of defaulting may end up never visiting your business again.< /review>

<text>These people are HARRSSING ME via my credit report. This bill belongs to the VA. In the course of collecting information to sort that out, spoke with several people here. None were helpful, saying someone would call me back while denying they placed a Derogatory on my Credit Report EVERY SINGLE TIME I called them acting in GOOD FAITH .. Not ONCE has my phone rung ..

Since Oct 29 they have sent a Derogatory FOUR TIMES. FOUR TIMES IN 3 WEEKS!! They CLAIM they only report ONCE a month.

THIS IS A LIE

Unless you are responsible for a bill they hold..

DO NOT CALL THEM ..YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!</text>< Pictures>

<text>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I reached out the day after I got their letter of a outstanding balance, 3 weeks later I have yet to receive any response. I, then, take it upon myself to call their client to inform them that I have been trying to pay this bill but have not been successful in getting a response. Their client connects me directly to them. I get the wonderful pleasure of getting the most attitude ridden person I've ever come across in customer service. I was explaining the situation and she proceeds to give me attitude that their system registered my email a day later....mind you, I emailed them on 10/31 and she confirmed that on 11/9 is when they received, I'm pretty sure that's more than ONE day. Scary she's dealing with numbers and accounts, yet can't figure out that it's more than one day. So, I proceed to explain that because of their lack of response, the interest rate has gone up but that I'd be more than happy to settle this account based on the total due on the letter THEY sent, it's a $3.90 difference and she REFUSED. I mean, I don't know how this business is ran but I think, for the sake of their client (which should be the most important element), they would be willing to eat up $3.90 to close out the account and get paid. I will reach out to their client to explain that they refused to have this account paid due to $3.90. Also, I will follow up with a few complaints about the lack of customer service from that ghetto woman I spoke to. She got really ghetto when I told her that I hadn't heard from them and when I tried to correct her about the dates but then again, it says a lot that no one responded to my inquiry. You'll be hearing more from me.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2d7cf3aac0779:0xae22f9927350613b<//gmapID></record>

So i got a call from here and they asked me to confirm my name and number, i asked what this call was and what its regarding and the lady replied with her name and asked me to confirm mine again. She was super rude so I assumed it was a scam call, she finally told me the companies name and i asked her what they are calling about before I confirm my name and number because I've been scammed and refuse to give my information until i am sure its not a scam and she laughed and hung up on me.

I googled the company after the call, for a collection agency to hire such rude and unprofessional people, they must not want to collect that badly. They need to be more professional.<//Text>

<review>I was a bit nervous coming here due to low ratings. I have been out of the country for about half a year, during that time, I missed the Providence Medical bill. Maria Z. was AWESOME! she immediately stated that they will do the full DELETION on credit report if paid in FULL. They issued a promise letter for a full deletion. If I don't come back and update this rating, they fully honored their promise.< /review>< Name>

nah. they were pretty rude when I tired to call for my mom. I tried telling the woman her account number but the lady kept talking over me and not letting me finish talking. I told her the reason I was calling and she just cut me off and did let me  finish talking. I told her the account number several times and didn't write it correctly until the 4th or 5th time. horrible.<//Review>

<review>Plenty of collection companies with work with you to get these things paid off. They understand when you want to take care of something and are doing your best, it's best to just get it settled. This company will NOT. They are rude and awful people.

Went to help a family member going through a financial hardship these people were rude cutthroat won't even listen and don't even care so here's some information for you. If these people are harassing you you can issue a cease-and-desist when they send you a billing statement they cannot call you when this is done. Also go on to the credit bureau website in dispute if it's reflecting on your credit as closed because the hospital probably reported this as a loss and sold the debt to the collection agency. There is no reason for them not to work with you except for greed. Hope you all have a fantastic day<//text>

<review>They hit my credit with a random hospital collection and sent me a bill. I sent them a certified letter a few days later requesting that they provide proof that this alleged debt is mine within 30 days. I have the return label from the certified letter showing that they received it on Dec. 23rd and I still have not heard back from them. Their 30 days to provide proof that I am responsible for this debt has passed, and if they proceed with any further collection attempts or fail to remove it from my credit, they'll be hearing from my lawyer.

Be as ruthless and unpleasant with these people as they are with you. Don't pay them a single cent, demand proof via certified letter of any debt they claim you owe them, dispute EVERYTHING.</review>< pictures>

<Name>Heather Frantz<//Name><Time>1569024830366</Time><text>They sent me a notice/bill. I called immediately because i thought the bill was in my payment plan which is deducted monthly. Didn't understand what was going on. I explained the situation and requested time to follow up and see what the confusion was. Less than a week after I called, they reported a collection on my credit report. I'm not even sure this is legal considering it was less than a week. After that I decided I wasn't dealing with them. I sent my payment to my provider and my provider cashed check so they accepted payment and because I didnt pay through PMS, PMS gets NOTHING 😂😂😂. HIGHLY UNETHICAL company with super shady business practices. They could've contacted me again or waited for me to call back after I straightened it out but they didn't so...you lose PMS and since the provider accepted payment directly the collection is invalid/non existent. I let them know they needed to remove from credit report immediately or be sued for fraudulent reporting.< /text><rate>1< /rate>< user_id>

I actually had a good experience with the call center employee (Janisha I think was her name). They had been leaving me messages and I thought it was a scam. Turns out SHARP didn't report that I had paid a bill in April so this debt collector had been trying to get ahold of me. Luckily I caught it before my credit was affected and emailed my proof of payment. THANKS SHARP (expletive expletive). All for a back sprain checkup and being talked into a stupid flu shot.< /Text>

< Review>
For six long years, I've been dealing with a medical collection they haven't proved is mine. All they provide is a pages of charges. They never showed me one single document with a signature. They never showed me admission forms or discharge documents with my signature. The only language they understand is lawsuits. Ultimately this is the only way to settle this.<//Review>

I only gave a rating of 1because I couldn't give a lower # . I have  repeatedly tried to contact to pay a bill.  Can't get past recording and being hung up on.well I finally got through.  The lady was really nice and helpful.  But trying to get through to someone was horrible.</Text>

<Text>The entire dentist staff is very polite respectful and patient, I will refer all my friends and family here. I had a fantastic experience with all the major dental work that I am getting done. My dentist Dr.Yaghobian and his assistant Vanessa are detail oriented and they are the best, love this power duo and I will continue to request all my dental work with them. Thank you all so much for comforting me and for making something that was traumatic, turn into a joyful beautiful smile that is tailored specially for me.

<date>1620341574862<//date><Text>I have been a patient of Lancaster Family Dental for several years during that time Andreas has been my X-ray technician. He has always been very professional,knowledgeable about his profession and caring, he made me feel like I was was special. I look forward to seeing him during each visit. I understand he has received a well deserved promotion. Congratulations Andreas.

I have nothing but praises for the office staff. My dentist Dr. Y and his assistants are all so attentive, professional, caring and make my dental visits very comforting. I have a few more follow ups and I know I have the best of the best taking great care of me. I especially love the new office on Ave K, Lancaster, they make everything Covid comfortable.
I am especially pleased with the special care I'm receiving right now with my new upper partial they are masters of their chosen profession.
The ladies in the front office are friendly, professional and pleasant to work with. They treat every client with respect and dignity.  I love Family Dental Practice Lancaster and give them a five star rating.</Text><rate>4< /rate>< response>

<Review>They OVERBOOK with only 2 specialists so if you don't mind waiting 2 hours or MORE in the lobby then this is your dentist. I kid you not, there was 5 people booked with 11 am appointments.

My daughter's appointment was at 11 am, she did not get seen until 1:45 pm. The procedure literally took 15 minutes.

If this dentist office really cared about the COMMUNITY and the people of Lancaster they wouldn't overbook knowing they don't have the staff to cover.

It seems as if this dentist office daily goal is to see how many insurance companies they can bill instead of a goal of, how we can be of SERVICE to the community and the children of our community. Having a child fast and wait for more than 2 1/2 hours to been seen is NOT service!!! It's money driven SERVICE!!!!

They are very inconsiderate of people's time and this isn't the first time this office has done this. The service was so horrible all the way around ALL 3 TIMES, I will be switching my family's dental provider.

Reviews, referrals and GREAT CUSTOMER= keeps your customers... FYI to the person in charge of this establishment.< /Review>< gmapID>

<review>My personal favorite place to go to for my dental care. Andres the X-ray tech was quite humorous, kind and professional Dr Y and Dr Amir are by far my favorite dentists. I’m 60 years old and I had to have a root canal. Yeah but I felt calm. Lupe , Vanessa the technicians there were super The ladies in the reception area were all so great. Family Dental Practice will be the only place that I will go to for my dental care. I highly recommend them.

Every time I had an appointment they would reschedule, and when I finally was helped they never knew why I was there they previously pull half my teeth and were suppose to make dentures for me and they never knew what was going on. I haven’t ate properly in 2 months because I’m missing so many teeth that they said I had to get removed. I still haven’t heard what’s going on. Please please consider twice before going to this horrible place.</Review>< Pics>

I have been without teeth for more than 3 months. I have gone to the dentist 4 times and each time I had to leave cuz they didn't contact my insurance. So myself  called my insurance and the women from my insurance company ask for your phone number and called the dentist office and told them my insurance was good. So that's how I got the appointment for today. Something had to be done please. Just think how you would feel with no teeth. The women in the office there need to be train d better.

I used to come here growing up. And have had some interesting experiences.

REGULAR DENTIST: 1/5
BE CAREFUL!!! I was very distrustful of the general dentist at this clinic when I became an adult because of how they would treat my parents and I even got up once when they wanted to fill in non existent cavities and left. I say non existent because the dentist couldn’t show me where they were on an X-ray or even what was going on, because I went in for a cleaning and next thing I know he shows up with drills, when I questioned him he was shocked and didn’t know what to say. If they can’t show or prove something to you or get angry at you for just wanting know more about your teeth or alternative treatment or if you just feel like something is off go somewhere else at the very least for a second opinion.

Always! Always! Always, ask questions!!!  If your dentist doesn’t answer those questions or get hostile and try to bully you into treatment go somewhere else. Always pay attention to the X-ray before they say anything. And pay attention if they recommend a deep cleaning a regular pocket is 1-3 and you can get away with 4 in the molars. Do not let them recommend one if you know they are healthy. You know your teeth!! You know your habits! It looks like this place just hands these out and root canals like candy. If you need work done always get a second opinion and look for other offices you can go to! A root canal should always be the last option! You need to try and do anything you can before that to save a tooth, and yes deep fillings are a thing they are called pulp caps don’t let the dentist here bully you into thinking you only have 2 options. A tooth has a fighting chance if nerve has not touched the decay.

I went in for a crack I got on a back molar a few years ago when this place did my wisdom teeth extractions.  They never addressed this when I came in after and I told them about it. I finally went in to this office again because I didn’t have a choice and this was now not just a crack but had turned into a cavity. When I saw the X-ray I saw that the cavity had not touched the nerve and the dentist tried bullying me into either doing a root canal or extraction, but apparently deep fillings are a thing and the decay hadn’t reached my nerve yet and I had no pain. He didn’t even cold test my tooth to see if it could be saved it. He also didn’t like it when I asked questions. He then assessed my teeth pockets for a deep cleaning and said I needed one, but I was paying attention to the numbers and my gums are healthy, and according to my new dental office I over brush so doing this would have been really bad for my teeth and gums. Did you know you can have receding gums from over brushing too!! I had no idea!!! Not once was this ever addressed nor did they ask about my dental habits.I don’t even think they screened me from oral cancer.

A good dentist is always willing to explain and make your experience better not make it worse.

And watch out for the insurance person they will try to convince you too accept certain treatments by using buzzwords to scare a no into a yes. I don’t blame them or the staff or anyone really this is just the way people here have always been trained for as long I can remember.

I ended up going to Av Sierra Dental and got the help I needed. I went in terrified because of my experience at Family Dental Practice and walked out with a restored faith in my dental practitioners and what they are here to do. You just have to look for what’s right for you, and Family Dental Practice was not it for me.

MY WORDS OF ADVICE:
1. DO RESEARCH
2. ASK QUESTIONS
3. FIND A PLACE YOU CAN TRUST.

Look up the places on Yelp, google, shop around see what feels right for you because I can tell you when you’re not anxiously sitting in the chair because you don’t trust your dentist any treatment goes by way smoother. I never knew that was possible.

ORTHODONTIST at this Location : 4/5
2008-2010 The orthodontist was probably the best person there. He showed me how to take care of my teeth.</review>

The staff here are wonderful individuals! Upon walking in you’ll have somebody check you in and take your temperature. My experience today was great. I was seen fairly quickly within ten minutes of waiting. Their new facility is spacious and clean. All staff comply with the personal protective equipment necessary required during the pandemic. Dr. Yaghobian, Andres and Zoila could not have attended me any better. They are attentive and maintain a high aura of professionalism. Thank you so much for your work. You are greatly appreciated!</text>

<Text>This office is very unorganized! I drive 50mins to this dental office just to be turned away. I had an exam done 2weeks ago. They told me what needed to be done. We set an appointment for me to be seen 2 wks down the line. They made changes to my appointment without giving me a courtesy call, so I wouldn't waste my time or money! I go in, just to be turned away....again!!! That's the 2nd time something like this has happened with this particular office! I know I have HMO, but gosh!!

<Text>The staff was extremely slow, I waited 3 hrs or more after my appointment time. I initially went in for a chipped tooth but ended up getting a wisdom tooth pulled. . An unrelated issue that wasn’t even causing me any pain to begin with but was told they couldn’t help me with the chipped tooth! They discharged me with no pain meds which left me in AGONIZING pain for hours until I could get the prescription filled and picked up and I can feel the stitches all the way in my throat. My mouth is still numb, I didn’t know what I was getting myself into and this surgery wasn’t explained to me beforehand, I feel duped, like it was done just for a paycheck and not for my benefit.  I don’t like leaving bad reviews but this place  deserves it.</Text>< Resp>

< Review>
My son had an appointment at 9am we were seen until almost 10am. They had several other patients at the same time. Once we enter the office  the
x-ray lady had very little experience in doing x-rays another lady had to assist in taking x-rays on 7 year old. Once we were place in the room, my son was briefly seen by Dr, who pointed to one out of 8 cavities. He did not have a cleaning done and that was the whole appointment. 2 hours in the office just for that.< /Review>

I have been to this office on a couple of different occasions, and it seemed to get worse as the visits went on!
First, they spread out your appointments for seemingly no particular reason. I have never been anywhere that doesn’t do your teeth cleaning same day if there is nothing else to be done.
Second, it really doesn’t matter what time your appointment is because you’ll end up waiting 2 hours anyway.
The only upside is the staff is nice, and their new office is clean as well.
Seems they schedule to many people at the same time, and then the service they give you once your actually in is very lackluster.</Text>

When I asked for an estimate of how much longer it'd be, no one had an answer. It's like they scheduled everyone for the same appointment time. The parking lot is FULL of people waiting. I'm only staying because I have braces and need my bottom rows put on, which they were supposed to do 2 VISITS AGO! Honestly, I'd never recommend this place.

Staff is very friendly and polite to patients, however the wait time is too excessive. My appointment was at 11am and did not get seen until around 12:30pm. X-rays were taken and then was seated in a room to wait for the doctor. Doctor came by 30 min later and was gone within 5 min. All seemed ok and his recommendation was just a deep cleaning. At 1:40pm I was still waiting to get the cleaning done. Staff were standing around, cracking jokes and being a tad unprofessional (doctors talking about patients in their language as well as assistants talking in Spanish about patients). I got up and left almost unnoticed. My family also went there last Saturday, their Appoinment was at 9am and they weren’t out until almost 2pm. I’d rather go to my dentist in LA where I get seen at my Appoinment time and get more than 5 min with my dentist to make sure my dental health is on point.< /review>

My son’s Appointment at 9:00am, wait for 3.5 hours till 12:30pm ONLY had X-ray done( that took about 10min), We asked for the estimate waiting time to see dentist, no one was able to give the answer.🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️  I don’t see the difference between walk-in and Appt.  It was totally messed up. Then we were told either reschedule for the cleaning and sealing or wait another 30min to get service. I’ve never heard of any dental visit for almost 4 hours Only for a basic cleaning and sealing .The lady in the front desk had an attitude when help us reschedule. She would repeat her questions loudly as if we didn’t understand English. Bad service, bad experience , wouldn’t recommend to anyone!😫😫< /Text>

I walked in looking for a new dentist since my previous dentist retired due to COVID down the hill in Beverly Hills. I was able to get an appointment the next day for my family and the staff were very professional and welcome us with open arms. Andres took my X-rays and his demeanor was exceptional as if we were childhood buddies. Vanessa and Zoila assisted Dr. Yaqhobian and they did a wonderful job. I can't leave out the officer manager and the front desk staff who made the atmosphere very friendly since we all know that going to the dentist is not number one on anyone's list. All in all, this location is amazing and I'll be their patient as long as I remain in the area.
Thank you!!!< /review>

I brought my 11 year old son in for an exam and ANDRES was very friendly, easy going and professional. I appreciate his patience, as I know working with children is not easy but he did it with so much kindness. I give him 10 stars if I could. Keep up the excellent patient care/customer service!!!</review>

<Review>My first experience at The Family Dental Practice of Lancaster took place on November 17, 2020 was outstanding. From the moment I checked to getting screened, my X-rays, dental exam, and finally the scheduling of my follow on appointments I was treated with upmost care in a very relaxing environment. I would proudly recommend this clinic to anyone. Thanks so much to the associates and doctor who took excellent care of me. I will see you wonderful folks very soon and keep those 80's tunes playing in the background. Lol!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<name>Mz Aracely<//name><time>1614615662334</time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I made an appointment for my three kids since it was a school holiday. I waited for one hour and thirty mins to even be called back for xrays. They only called my kids because I told them we were going to leave. My appointment was at 10am and I left at 130pm. The place is a mess they didnt even know that I had three kids there. They did the work on my son without consulting me and asked me to initial for the work after it was done. There was this woman with an accent that was overly pushy and for someone who thinks they run the office, she had no clue who she was treating or who the children belinged to. This woman barks orders at you without knowing who you are or why you are there. They expect you to leave your kids in their care and wait in the front. Sorry, I dont trust anyone like that when it comes to my kids. Nothing was organized, even the dentist pointed out that the patient board wasnt properly updated. I dont mind waiting but this place is never on time. They may have a new office but they have the same slow service. Also, if you come in with medical you are treated like you are beneth them. They will treat you like you are ignorant/uneducated and how dare you ask to be treated like people who pay for their services. I dont know how they managed to get a 4.8 review.<//Review>< pics>

My son was constantly called “bro” by the technician while his X-rays were being done and he didn’t appreciate the unprofessional manner.
Then they made us wait for them finding our insurance details and never called back with the proper information when they should have had that available since day one.

Well I showed up 20 minutes late because I was about 10 minutes late on my own and went to the old office cuz the call I got the night before to remind me of my appointment didn’t inform me of the address change but I was very grateful for the reminder and expressed it to the caller. However I waited a whole hour literally and even placed in a chair to be worked on to be told the lab work wasn’t done and I had to come back at a later date. It was disappointing. However the genuine friendliness of the woman who came and spoke to me was so cool that my aggravation disappeared and I was able to smile and reschedule without an attitude. So that’s my experience sincerely</text>

My appointment was at 10am. I arrived at 9:30am didn't get called in till 10:50. X ray took 15 mins. Then they had me wait for the doctor. Waited till 12:30 before I had enough asked when will someone be coming? Then told me another 30min or more. I walked out if you like want to spend 8 hrs waiting and get nothing done beside xrays this is the place for you.< /review>

If I could give a zero I would. I’ve had braces for almost FIVE YEARS NOW and every single time i come in i’m told different things by different doctors that i’ve never seen before. The wait WITH and appointment is a couple hours which defeats the purpose of an appointment. I was told I need surgery, to wear rubber bands, to take out teeth and more. Ive had very rude people helping me before and ones that are okay. most of the time i have a bad experience with someone who is very aggressive. I definitely wouldn’t recommend if you are trying to get braces.</text>

I have been to this practice a few times each time they put a request for work done and never contact me again one time I called because I received a letter from insurance saying they needed better X-rays i had to call the dentist office to get more done that was a year ago and I have not received a response which leads me to believe second X-rays were not turned in my last visit was at 12:30 I was in the waiting room waiting for 2 X-rays till 2:10 pm then put in a room and made to wait again when the doctor was told I was next he said she is limited And she can wait</Review>

Excellent, excellent service!!!! The staff is friendly and efficient , the facility is clean . They practice social distancing and make everyone follow the rules . Although everyone was nice, I have to thank these staff members individually. Nataly did my cleaning and whitening of my teeth, she was gentle, informative and went above and beyond to get the look I wanted. Kenia did my X-rays she conversed  with me , was fast and didn’t just shove the X-ray pieces in my mouth like what usually happens , for me that’s a big deal. Lupe I remember from their old office and she always , always is sweet and helpful. Evelyn handles loans and insurance shes patient , has no problem explaining, very informative and actually wants to help . Summer also helped even when it was closing time , didn’t make me feel bad and tried to get all I wanted done before I left. The dentist is not usually where you have good experiences but I would definitely recommend them for all your dental needs . It makes a big difference to have a great visit from the beginning to end .

I know a lot of people complain about the wait time but we are in a different era, in order to make sure we are safe they have to do extra cleaning and sanitizing, so if you want to get sick or be seen in a dirty office go somewhere else , don’t complain about that as if they can help it at this time , they really are doing their best under the circumstances. I just had to say that, ok I’m done .... Thanks again !</review>

He wouldn't give me gas, he said he would tell me a joke. He numbed my mouth and pulled the tooth. That part was fine. I thought he was finished. I don't exactly know what he did next, except that it was very painful and he wouldn't stop and I was screaming and crying. He said "I'm not doing anything, stop what"? I said whatever you're doing STOP! He said you're numb, you're not feeling pain only pressure. He said I was a big girl and I didn't need gas and it was late, he stayed late for me. I have never had such horrible treatment ever! If he was the last dentist on earth I wouldn't go back. If they said they don't use gas I never would have made the appointment.

If you enjoy unfulfilled promises and overcharging of your dental benefits, this is the place for you. Not only are they dishonest, but horribly inefficient. By far the most mismanaged medical/dental office on Earth.

<userid>108204505832512282407</userid><review>The staff is really nice and they are taking great measures to social distance everyone but the wait times are horrible. What's the point of having an appointment if you just sit there for hours anyway? I understand things are different due to covid and wait times may be slightly longer but my son sat in the waiting room for almost 2 hours today just to have his bands changed on his braces. If I didn't say something after an hour and a half of waiting we probably would have been there longer. I don't mind a little wait but anything over 30 to 40 mins when you have a scheduled appointment is just crazy. Seems like they are scheduling too many appointments at once and then they get backed up. They even had people waiting outside because the waiting room was full. Whoever is managing this location is not doing a great job and the scheduling should be looked at!< /review>< Response>

<Review>I retract my previous post about Family Dental Practice of Lancaster since the management team has been replaced with negligent, mean-spirited, and inept office workers. It was horrifying to hear Dr. Baha say to me that I needed $20,000 in reconstructive dental surgery. This doctor is taking advantage of many of his clients for the sole purpose of benefitting himself.

There was a young lady (whose name I will insert later) who came after my appointment was finished with Dr. Baha and told me about my summary cost. “So you want to go ahead with the $20K reconstructive dental surgery?” she said, almost not believing she was reading it correctly. I was shocked and perturbed.

I was later told in a different dental practice that I only needed a night-guard, and maybe, just maybe porcelain fillers in the future. Family Dental Practice of Lancaster did not speak with truth and honesty, but rather has been taking advantage of their clients.

This dentistry is not the same. Their office workers try to monetize on those most vulnerable and are not concerned with your dental care, even if you have some form of insurance.

This dental practice is a gateway to theft, patient negligence, and incompetence. As a whole, they appear seemingly busy, yet pass the hours idling on Facebook while some patients suffer tremendously at the claws of a greedy dentist like Dr. Baha.

The only doctor that is humane and vested in their patients is Dr. Neema. He is an excellent dentist. Please ask for him the next time you go. The nurses are kind and hard-working. Make sure that the office workers are doing their job by stopping their dangerous negligence in their tracks. There needs to be a change in the management team, desperately. Family Dental Practice of Lancaster is by far one of the worst dentistries in the AV because of its management team and Dr. Baha.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I would get a second opinion from another dentist. I went and they tried to tell me I had 3 cavities and needed 3 root canals and also needed a co payment. I went to another dentist and only had 1 cavity and needed 1 root canal and they didn't charge a co pay. How is that??? A bad first impression by westcoast dental.< /Review>

<text>The staff is kind, but they really aren’t trained properly. They don’t check insurance prior to your appointment, leading to an extensive wait time and a rescheduling if you have a weekend/ holiday appointment. They should know that the insurance company will be closed and check prior to those appts. It’s common sense.
I had an appointment pre-pandemic to complete a major root canal with crown and infection - the appointment was 4 days after some “prep” work for the infection. The pandemic hit, we got a call 2 days before the appt, saying that the office was closed and they have to cancel all appointments. Ok, not a problem, we are in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that. 2 months later, I call. Still not taking appointments. Ok, they are closed still. My frustration is that they opened up and never called anyone to reschedule. I overheard a coworker 6 months later talking about a dentist appt she had 1 month ago and thought, oh! They are open?!? So I called and of course they have been open for months! Why didn’t the patience that had ongoing treatment prior to get notice?!?

After that, I scheduled an appt. and they were so behind that I waited 1.5 hours before they said that we should reschedule. They definitely OVERBOOK the appointments. I rescheduled with a fight, and returned. They are still 1.5 hours behind (with a 9am appt) got in for X-rays and was told they couldn’t verify insurance. So I will have to reschedule for treatment!
I proceeded to tell them I’ll pay for the treatment then, because I won’t return to do this all over again! They can reimburse me when my insurance covers it.
If you have decent insurance, I suggest you find a better dentist office. I do, and I will AFTER they do the treatment that was paid for 8 months ago! Sucks for the nice girls that work in the front office, because i had to bring my outside voice to get the attention I deserve.
UPDATE: After complaints(unfortunately), they did make every effort to accommodate and get me in as soon as possible. The customer service Was great, and as stated previously, the staff is very kind. I feel that their above and beyond assistance with me may have caused Delay in other people’s appts, which I’m sure is a constant circle for them. All in all I raised it from 2 stars to 3, merely based upon the time I’ve had to take off work and the frustration. We shall see the dr reviews upon completion.</text><user_name>Kealoha Akiona< /user_name>< GmapID>

< Review>
My son had an appointment @4pm after almost 2 hours of waiting for the doctor to tell me they can’t see him because of his insurance. What a complete waste of time. When I called to schedule an appointment they said they did accept my insurance but I guess they realized that after 2 hours being there. I would have assumed they would of told me something when they took the insurance card once I checked in. They had to tell me after waiting for so long. Never coming here again lack of communication.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Update: They did reach out to me but not to resolve anything. They said they would pass on my info but I never got help. I'm now stuck in an ortho contract and paying $200 a month for no treatment and they wont pass on my referrals. Good luck contacting them as apparently their phones just dont work and nobody can reach an entire office. I'll just have to read my fortune and hope I drive to Lancaster the 1 day a month the ortho is there to cancel my contract.

I wish I could give negative stars. The orthodontist at the "old" location, his assistant and his staff are amazing. However at the "new" location, where the oral surgeon is, I've been treated terribly. Summer has been rude and unprofessional with not only me but also OTHER PATIENTS IN THE WAITING ROOM. She doesn't even care to pretend to be nice. I was not given a consultation when I originally went in to get my xrays. I was simply told to leave and when Summer called to inform me of my approved appointment she became upset when I started asking questions (because I didn't have a consultation I had a lot of questions before signing up for a surgery.) I tried to inform her that the sedative chosen for my surgery will not work for me, but she insisted and continued to talk over most of my concerns while giving vague answers and insisting I had a consultation already where this all would have been answered. Because I need the treatment for my next orthodontist appointment I drove into town, took time off work, and then was told in office that I will need anaesthesia they don't even provide at this practice. So yes Summer, you could have prevented this by simply listening during our phone call and treating me like a human.</review>< pics>

If I could I would give them a - on the stars is the worse dental office I have ever been to I felt like I was being scammed 1st of all they said that I needed more dental work and what I went in there for. Then they're telling me that my insurance didn't cover what I needed so  I had to apply through care credit to cover the cost. Head at least 7 or 8 reschedules Took almost a year to complete the work and I contacted my insurance and they did cover the work so now I've been waiting for almost 3 months to get a refund on the money that they charged me in the mean time I'm being charged interest on the credit care card I repeat do not go to this dentiste their scams and thieves< /text>

Worst dental practice I’ve ever been to.

If you enjoy corrupt, money hungry individuals, this place is for you. Regardless of teeth status, they’ll only want to do a deep cleaning to net them the most amount of money and they’ll stretch it out over 3 different appointments JUST to scrape and claw more dollars away. They even tried to convince me I needed a device to prevent gum erosion. Which would have came to $800 AFTER insurance covers what they would. These people are total phonies.

But to top it off, their negligence even went a step further as they failed to provide my insurance company (Blue Cross Blue Shield) with my x-rays and dentist notes which made my insurance company decline my coverage and setting me up for a $686 bill ON TOP of me already paying the $220 NOT covered in a deep cleaning.

Save yourself the headache and the frustration. Incredibly incompetent organization.<//text>

< Review>
Although the staff is great, super friendly and professional this office is not the best. When it comes to Ortho they have very few appointments available. My daughter has to be seen every two months because they are not flexible at all with appointments. And once you finally get to your appointment expect a long wait before you are seen, 45 mins to an hour at least. There’s always a new doctor every single one says my daughters needs something else. And to top it off with their new precaution procedures I’m not allowed inside with my daughter who is a minor (12). I’m suppose to wait outside?! I’m sorry but I don’t trust anyone to not have a close eye on my daughter. The doctor never speaks to me after seeing her to give an update of her progress.</Review>

<text>My experience was very irritating. I scheduled my children's appointment 3 months ago and got a call confirming my appointment the day before. When we came into the office and checked in the staff informed us that we had to many people, my 4 children and I, to come into the room to see the dentist and that my children were also to small to stay in the room alone. It Would have been nice to know the day before that this was the policy especially because I drove 3 hours from San Diego to come to this appointment. I dont live in this town but my children's father lives here. I understand that its because of the Corona virus but at my work we tell every person over the phone what our policy is for covid19 so there are no surprises. I have had to come here twice now and both times the office staff has been below par. I had to scramble to find someone who could stay with 2 of my children so my other 2 kids could see a dentist this year. Thank you ladies for your excellent customer service skills. I really appreciate the time and effort you all put in to make my life a little smoother.

On a lighter note the man who took the exrays was literally the only person in this office who deserves a good rating. He was fast and had very good customer service skills. I came to him in a bad mood and left him feeling better and calm.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Wait time is horrible. Afternoon appointment and I waited  almost two hours for my kids x-rays to be told they had cavities  and I needed to reschedule. No cleaning was done.  Another day I scheduled an appointment early in the morning. I still had to wait almost an hour and a half to be called back for the filling.</text>

This was the second specialist I have been to and was very pleased with them telling me they will be able to help me and not trying to overcharge me for unnecessary work like the first specialist.< /Review>

<Review>Would not recommend unless your a very important person with great insurance otherwise you will be waiting hours passed your appointment time even if you are 30 minutes early.

<Text>Do you want to feel like you're at a Used Car Lot? Visit Family Dental Practice of Lancaster. It is really frustrating. Not to mention they send all these surveys out (repeatedly) only to not respond to direct issues. So, maybe some public admonishment will help them pay attention to their PATIENTS. First and foremost, I'm there for dental healthcare, not to be upsold or to wait to see multiple people. They really need to change their whole business approach. If a patient is on time, then they should be seen within 30 minutes of arrival not an hour or more. Once X-Rays were done I sat waiting for another 30 minutes for the dentist to review my X-Rays and to check my mouth only to receive a recommendation of a cleaning and $8,800.00 USD in unnecessary crowns to replace my fillings.  But before I could ask questions or decline on the up-sale, the Dentist leaves again only to send in an office worker to go through this entire sales pitch. This needs to change. I only want to see the front office workers at check-in and check-out, once I'm in the chair I just want the job to get done and not be upsold! If they don't change then I guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere. Total time at the dentist for a simple X-Ray, Biannual Check-Up, and Cleaning, 2.5 hours (actual time receiving the care I came in for 30 minutes). I should charge them for my time.

<Text>Only they care to take X ray and gets money for doing more X ray. Dr dentist, named, Amir Hemmati, had ordered deep cleaning for the following authorization, but never do the simple cleaning for this visit. They care this location to get X ray, but never treat the patients. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there, especially to this dentist, who stopped the simple cleaning of the teeth. Waiting for the authorization  for deep cleaning which may need more than six weeks, and disallowing the simple cleaning of the teeth. Manager is very cooperative, but can't override the dentist recommendation, neither to talk to him. Loosing customer may cost this firm a lot of money. 16 X rays of images, and they can't refer the X ray to another Dentist which put people again into another 16 X rays with another dentist to do the simple cleaning. I am not satisfy, and I feel they care to have money without giving the right service for the patients. I wouldn't recommend this place due the Dentist named Amir Hemmati.  If they had informed the patients a head of time only Xrays but no services, I think the patients could have given the option to accept it, but if they did Xrays only without giving any service, this absolutely wrong.</Text>< pictures>

I went to this office for a wisdom tooth extraction...not the case. On top of being discriminated  by one of the dental assistants telling me I'm very old. Then the oral surgeon yelled at me loud enough for for ppl to hear my business. Needless to say I filed a complaint and when I get all dental work done I am done and onto another clinic.< /review>

Very friendly staff. The wait is kinda long due to only one Dentist available. I’ve been there 5 times and every time they have done a great job at helping you understand their procedures. They do try to get the job done with one dentist 🦷. I highly recommend them .<//Text>

<text>Make sure you DEMAND to see what you are being charged for. I didn’t and I ended up paying for a service that I wasn’t told I needed. Summer Chavez handled my billing. I had an optional service added to my bill without it being discussed with me before the service was performed. The office staff doesn’t care about your complaints so make sure to contact Western Dental directly. I was told that the Dr. would have declined my service if I would not have agreed to the OPTIONAL service. I was told this AFTER the service was completed and i saw the contract and complained. If it was so critical to my treatment, it should have been disclosed and my my options should have been presented to me then.<//text></record>

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!! Honestly don't know where to start. Wish I had took my daughter to another office for her ortho and general dentist needs.  If I could give ZERO stars I would. Biggest mistake I've  made. 1:30 appointment and still waiting at 4:44 smfh. What should have been 18-24 months of braces treatment  has become 4-5 plus years because they change their staff on almost a monthly bases and different doctors come in doing different things. Terrible coordinated care, if I can even call it that. My daughter is now in her senior year of high school and has had her braces since like 7th grade!!! So much more I could say but I'm tired of texting. Do yourself  a favor and seek ortho care elsewhere, because once they put the braces on, no other orthodontist will treat you and you'll basically be stuck, unless you can afford to remove them and pay again somewhere else. Just don't do it.< /text>

The staff is pretty nice. This time around we had a way nicer dentist. Just be prepared to wait a minimum an hour and 30 minutes past your appointment. For some reason it’s always a long wait. This time they try to use the excuse of COVID-19 for the delays but we were there before Covid and it was still a two hour wait. The plus side is today the doctor was super friendly and nice versus our last appointment the other doctor was cold and rude. Overall it was a good experience but I just wish it wouldn’t be such a long wait<//text>

<Text>I am here now and have been since 11am.
My child is 8 and has not eaten since 7pm yesterday The 24th, it is now 2:43pm on the 25th and she and I have been waiting for over three hours. THREE HOURS and counting. My daughter is hungry and thirsty, by the the time we get seen and the numbness wares off it will have probably be around 7pm which will have made the length of her fast 24 hrs. The staff is nice, really nice but whoever is running the place should have a better system in place for scheduling to make sure kids that are having procedures don’t have to wait this long. I can’t imagine what the parents of younger children are doing to keep their kids entertained during these incredibly LONG wait times. I would also like to point out that the staff fails to mention how long the wait times are, if they actually had said something I could have brought activities for my little one.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c25adab5d14c71:0xa3dcaa0ad64acc</Gmap_id></record>

I have been to many dental offices not only because I can never find one that I can trust but also because I have a fear of them. Coming to Family Dental of Lancaster has made me look at a dental office differently. My appointments are made quickly & the staff has always been so helpful, patient & caring. Evelyn is the manager of the office and it shows what a great staff looks like when working together.<//Review>

I haven't had much luck with dental offices and I must say Family Dental is the best in the AV!   I was able to get in right away and Evelyn took her time to explain my dental benefits and got me started right away with my crown.  Happy that I finally found a great dental office:)<//review>

<Text>Dr. David is a honest and great dentist.  He restored my bite and saved teeth.  He did what UCLA Dentists couldn't do. At UCLA they only pulled my damaged teeth. Dr David saved my teeth and gave back my confidence. He's worth any distance to drive or fly to have him fix your teeth. Thanks to Dr. David and his dental colleagues. I'm able to smile and be confident again in society. Thanks everybody at Family Dental in Lancaster Ca. for your help and support.< /Text>< rate>

By far one of the best dental office in the AV. The staff was very polite and welcoming! I got braces and the staff did a great job in explaining everything from finances to the proper dental care.

I’ve been coming to this dental office for about 2 years now and I would  never go anywhere else! The staff is friendly and by far the most helpful one is Evelyn, she’s helped me so much with finances and working around my hours to schedule my appointments. She is extremely accommodating and understanding to the people i’ve recommended.This office is very clean and organized. I’ve recommended this dental office to friends and family and they’re always so impressed with the help and the service they offer! I will keep recommending this place to everyone I know!< /review>

What a filthy dentist office, 2 to 3 hour wait for x-rays and then all they want to do is the most expensive procedures. Patients get worked on in stalls and not closed offices.
One dentist trying to see 6 or 7 Patients at a time, what a joke.<//Review>

<Text>Don't take your children here. It was such an awful experience. First appointment waited 3 hours and they did x-ray on each of my children and when I was with my younger child, my older child was supposed to be getting her teeth cleaned. They told me they cleaned my daughter's teeth, but didn't have time to clean my son's. We had to make another appt.  I talked to my daughter on the way home and I figured out that they skipped the cleaning and only polished her teeth. We went back for a second appt and waited again for 2 hours. They took x-rays again of my son because they said they didn't have the X-rays from previous appt. Then they sent us home again without doing the cleaning!! I couldn't believe it! They told me sorry, there's nothing we can do, you'll have to come back again.  It was awful. We will never step foot into that office again.</Text>< Time>

I had a crown replaced last year here and within 2 months pieces fell off of it.  I went back and they said until it gets worse it wasn't worth the damage to fix it.  Within the year it fell off entirely.  They admitted that it shouldn't have come off and they would re-do it for free but said that I would additionally need $500 to crown the tooth next to it to stabilize the tooth.

I got a second opinion who said that was totally unnecessary and easily replaced the crown.  But I had to pay out of pocket.  I have been trying for 6 weeks to get a SINGLE RESPONSE from the original dental office in charge of getting a refund. Completely unprofessional and negligent.<//Text>

Today my daughter had a orthodontist appointment to say the least she wasn’t happy apparently the technician poked her three times, spilled water on her and gave her no advice as in brushing and tightening, or how treatment is coming along.  My daughter has had her braces on for a little over a year and pretty much all the time has good service except for today .< /text>

Ratings are important.  It gives the potential patient an idea of what to expect.  I was given your number and told this was a good place.  But based on your reviews I can see your lacking.  I wouldn't be surprised if the few good ratings were done by staff.  Either way you the doctors need not to be so greedy.  Treat people respectfully and your money will come.  won't get mine tho</text>

It was a fantastic experience overall. Yes, the wait time was a bit long but it's only because the staff was making sure that the oral surgeries were being done in the best way possible for the patients when a complication arose. The staff continuously checked on the waiting room too and kept apologizing for the wait. The only negative thing about my wisdom tooth removal was that the oral surgeon accidentally started pulling out a tooth before I was numb. Once he realized this he had immediately stopped, apologized for it, and gave me a little bit more local anesthesia, waited about 40 minutes or so, checked that I was fully numb then before pulling the remainder of my wisdom teeth out. I was actually able to walk out of it laughing. It's been a few days now and the oral surgeon did such a great job that I've barely had any pain at all. I highly recommend going here.<//Text>

I like this dental office.
The only downside is THE WAIT.
Today/usually it’s one hour or more.
Sometimes two hours or more which makes me confused about “appointments.”
Im feeling very disappointed today because I thought I came to this appointment to have DENTAL WORK DONE.
I was here already recently, had xrays
And an exam with the dentist. We set up a treatment plan.  I left that day?
NO WORK DONE.
Today?  Same thing!
xrays, dentist, More xrays, tx  plan,
And I’m leaving...NO WORK DONE.
I was told my teeth could be saved.
Now ? Dentures!!  😢
Guess I’m donating my teeth here.
Discouraging.
I will say The staff is helpful and friendly.

(Even with impatient, complaining
Patients like me. )</text>

Family Dental Practice has had my business for a few months now. I have been very pleased with the care I have received thus far. Not to be too loquacious in my review, but the staff and the doctors have only shown professionalism during my visits. The front office of Evelyn and the financial guru Cristela  is a great asset to the office.  My only complaint is, I wish I could have had the same dentist from start to finish on my ongoing procedure, but I do realize life moves on.</text>

<review>Would have given 0 stars of I could. 1 star is way to good for them. This is the worst dental place ever. I had an appointment at 3pm and literally didnt leave until 620pm. Took them 2hours 30 mins to even call me in the room. Just sat in the waiting room all that time. They will tell you anything to ba able to charge you. They are money hungry conniving liars.  Do not go here beware, stay away! By the way all I had done was an xray and cleaning. I will never go back to this place!< /review><Rating>1</Rating><UserId.>101334942466637208595<//UserId.>< Response>

If I can give zero stars I would Dr David was a joke went in he already looked stressed out He came and looked at x-rays and didn’t even try didn’t even examine straight to a referral for another specialist for my child to May I remind you at this point he didn’t even check on my kid immediately assuming that my child will not sit during a visit saying he did not have time to deal with squirmy kids Will  not recommend this dentist office just because of him other stuff very helpful.</Text>

I waited almost an hour to be seen. I was going to reschedule but then they put me back after I told them it was unreasonable to have people waiting almost an hour when they have an appointment. They over book patients so you have to wait. It’s an unprofessional practice but I will say the employees are nice. I had to park down the block because the parking is very limited.</text>

No issues with scheduling whatsoever. Go see Dr. Nema. He was to the point and actually explained in great detail what was going on in my mouth and why he suggested the treatment option he did. Shaper straightforward and will be back and requesting Dr. Nema again.

AMAZING experience. Called yesterday as a new patient with an emergency need for a root canal. They got me in the very next day! I get there early to sort paperwork, and was in the back within 10 minutes of my scheduled appointment time. Never did they try and upsell me on any of the things I needed, but did make suggestions that were easily accepted or declined with zero pressure. They were even able to knock 100 off of the medication for the root canal just to help me out!

I would STRONGLY suggest this dentists office as well as Dr. Sam. Both Lupe and Noel are amazing assistants that were always helpful and smiling as well. will be coming back here as well as switching my wife over to this DDS upon her arrival into Palmdale.<//review>< GmapID>

Our very 1st by appointment visit, two months ago was a two hour waiting to only be told I had to reschedule for my son to come back on another day, that they had other patients ahead of my son and most likely wouldn't get to my son any time soon. Very reluctant to come back, I scheduled a new appointment, after two months since this happened. Upon my arrival I told one of the staff members of my previous experience, she assured me this wouldn't happen again and would see that my son gets seen very shortly.
After again two hours of waiting I couldn't keep quiet. I told a staff member why has it been two hours and my son hasnt been seen yet? She then took me to a backroom with my son, where I came in contact with the Dr. And he told me in order to clean his teeth we would have to wait another longer period after getting xrays done...I asked him what is the problem? Why were we given an appointment? wasn't two hours of waiting long enough already?...he explained that he is the only Dr there, and cant attend to everyone in a given time, So I told him why is it that his personal staff over booking appointments he cannot attend to? He shrug his shoulders and said he didnt know". This Dental office needs to get rid of some of their staff, and hire abother Dr. who could actually help with whats important here. "The patients" This office is over staff that can't attend nor help patients dental needs, only one Dr. And a full lobby of unattended patients. I cannot wait to switch out of this Dental office asap. Worst experience in waiting period!!! 2 Thumbs down. And on top of it al they all sat there, not once did anyone apologized for the horrible experience I expressed I had previously and having once again.<//text>

I would have given 5 stars but I cant give that to any dentist office on principle due to my dental anxiety.  But, the staff at the front desk and the dentist here are great.  They explain everything to you up front and make sure that you understand.  The dentist that performed my surgical procedure on a referral from my last dentist office, was the reason that both myself and my wife change to make Family Dental of Lancaster our regular dentists.  She made me feel calm by thoroughly explaining what she was going to do and has a wonderful chair side manner. thanks again for restoring my faith in dentistry.<//Review>

This is the worst dentist I've ever been to. What's the point of making an appointment if you're gonna wait 3 hours to be seen by anyone? And once you are seen, you'll get your x-rays, then be waiting for another hour before anyone tells you what's going on in your mouth! Terrible customer service, and they're very money hungry. Don't trust what they say, and go somewhere else.</text>

My appointment was at 11:00 I arrived at 10:40 my goodness the wait was to long even if your on time  the  dentist finally  came in and was rushing it seems they only have one  dentist . But  I can say that Andres  was very kind and so polite thatz the only good thing I got out of visit. I couldn't believe what they wanted to charge me for my copay .I have very good insurance and for them not even having a person there  to do root canals .only once a month she comes in. When I called the 800 number I asked if this place had someone for that they said yes.it was a waste  of time.  I called my old Dr. In L.A. 250 for what I need  and they wanted 609 . Wow...  what an over change I'll have to notify  my insurance about that to see if they can charge that amount for 2 root canals.</review>

<text>I'm very pleased with how my dental work has been proceeding. Dr. Long and his assistants have done an amazing job at making me comfortable and keeping the process of a large bridge totally PAIN FREE, even with a few extractions.  I had a mess in my mouth due to years of neglect and lack of insurance. I'm glad, now that I'm able to finally do this work, that I have not felt embarrassed with the condition I came with. I feel they have my best interests at heart and strive to do great work. I'm very glad I chose Family Dental. And I look forward to great results as the process continues. Everybody from Reception, to XRays, to Assistants, to rebuilding a temp bridge several times to get it right, to Billing and Scheduling has been amazing, a genuine great group of people! They are team players.< /text>< gmap_id>

To much of a wait once you are checked in. Then after getting to the back we still had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for the doctor. We were the last patients of the day and the it showed in the amount of time she spent with my child. Everything felt rushed. Worse exam and cleaning ever. They didn't even put a bib on my child when they "cleaned" his teeth. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone and we will not be back.</Text>

I had an excellent experience at Family Dental Practice of Lancaster. The staff was very courteous, helpful and nice. My Doctor was beyond excellent! He was very attentive, thorough, caring and kind. He made me feel at ease. I felt reassured and cared for by him. It was very clean. Also, Andres and Theresa were very helpful and nice. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

<rating>2</rating><review>BEWARE!!!  My wife and I came to this place with x-rays in hand and a referral to an orthopedic surgeon.  After over an hour wait watching an obviously pirated DVD in the filthy waiting room while my wife was in excruciating pain. We were called back to sit in the chair.  After 15 more minutes, the receptionist let us know they couldn't get a hold of our insurance and we would have to pay upfront for costs.  We said no, and got up and left with our chart.  This was in March.  Now, in September we are in collection for a $50 charge labeled as a "Limited Exam".  Seeing that the dentist never even met my wife, let alone examined her in any way, I don't see what this charge is for.  After calling their office in Los Angeles, and talking to the Lancaster office, they are refusing to resend the charge.  Stating that the dentist says he saw her.  Please, Please do your loved ones a favor.  Don't go to this Dentist, there are a LOT of better even cheaper options in Lancaster.</review>< Pictures>

For the past 2 months I have called asking if there was a balance due.  Today I receive a bill, after being told repeatedly there is not one.  They have a habit of calling my juvenile Daughter to schedule appointments for procedures and exams without my knowledge.   The entire staff come across very incompetent and are quick to claim they are entering the correct info the file.    Obviously false, my "bill" went to the incorrect address.  Do not use this facility unless you're comfortable with being mislead or like having your child decide what needs to be done.< /Review>

When we started going to the dental office, it always had a friendly atmosphere. Today that I took my son for his appointment the receptionist had such a bad attitude, to calm her down I calmy asked "are you in a bad attitude?.  Also whoever is answering the phones also has an attitude almost to the point they want to hang up.<//text>

Why any Dentist, Doctor or any professional thinks overbooking is beneficial, I do not understand!  When in reality, all it does is tic people off and stress people out.   I was a new patient, my appointment was for 11 o’clock so I got there 15 minutes early to fill out papers. When I signed in I noticed there were seven other people in front of me that had signed in with 11 o’clock appointments and 2 people signed in behind me.  I completed the paperwork, turned it back into the receptionist and interrupted her and another coworker’s conversations about how they hope tonight will not be as late as last night!  As I sat waiting, listening to children scream and cry, watched more people come in and only 2 people leave, 2 people were called back and my stress level soared! I asked the lady sitting next to me if this was normal and how long she has been waiting? “Oh no, this isn’t as bad as usual.“. But, for me not to worry, “No matter how many are here, we all get seen.”   Apparently over booking is standard at Family Dentist.  People are rushed through and obviously the Dentist isn’t spending the time with each patient as they should! So, after waiting 55 minutes, only 2 people were called back and, not counting me, 23 people waiting.  I told the lady sitting next to me with a 10:30 appt., if anyone was not called back by 12 o’clock, I was leaving.  At 12:03pm, I walked out! Over 1 hour and only 2 people were called with many more coming In!   I can see booking 2 people for same time, but 10?  Too many other dentist, doctors out there to wait hours and hours for someone to spend 2 minutes with you!
Update:  Got a response from Family Dental.  Get real! Read your reviews!  You way overbook each and every day going back years!  And, every time you respond to a review, it’s the same response, Bovine Excrement!  Only thing you care about is How many people can we squeeze in to a day?  Who cares if the patients have to wait hours, cause you sure don’t or you would not continue to OVER BOOK!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1547681913273, 'text': "Dear Stuk, we know our patients' time is valuable and we do everything we can to adhere to a strict and timely schedule, unfortunately, emergencies and unforeseen issues in surgery at times put us behind.

<Text>Come in at 4 and wait till 5:45 to be seen. When you call the people answering the phones have no idea how to check there system. They tell me I don't have an appointment even though I do. Then they call to confirm the appointment.  Front desk people don't do there job very well then blame the problem you are trying to fix on someone else.  Avoid this place. There are many dental offices out there and these idiots don't have a clue as to what their doing.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They helped me feel relaxed. No pain at all during the numbing procedure. Tooth was broken and out in less than a song . They allowed me to have my music on to not think of my pain. I hate the dentist and I can honestly say I LOVE THIS PLACE.< /Text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>
<rate>5<//rate><Review>The facility was very presentable from the minute I walked in. The staff attended me promptly and were very kind. From the ladies at the front desk to the technicians in the back and of course the dentist herself were friendly and quite professional. The financial lady, Cristela informed me of all my options and was very knowledgeable. Cristela made sure I was aware of the different financial assistance companies their office work with and I will be following up with her shortly. Everyone there was great and I would surely recommend the facility to others<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Staff is nice but don't tell people to expect to be here for 2 to 3 hours if that isn't the case. When someone tells me 2 to 3 hours I expect that to include wait time and work to be done. I am writing this as I wait and it has now been 3 hours and still not called to the back. Worst place ever. Finally call me in after 3 and a half hours just to say they can't do it cause now a bone graft is needed. What a joke.< /Text>

This is the worst place I ever seen. The staff are so rude. I have a very bad experience zero stare is what they deserve for their service.  They do not care about people health all they care is the money. STAY AWAY from this office UNLESS YOU LIKE Spending YOUR MONEY FOR UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES AND BEING TOLD A  bunch  OF LIES IN THE PROCESS!!.</Text>

Theives.  I would never go there again.  Huge bill for a tooth. Requested to pull the tooth off and even for that the bill was $480.  Almost got robbed but ran away with my tooth due to their greed.  Will go to fix my tooth to Tijuana and the probability to get mugged in Tijuna streets streets is a lot less than inside this so called dental practice.<//review>

<text>About a year ago I took my daughter to get a baby root canal on her front teeth and about 2 weeks later, the cap fell off the tooth. I had to return up there to get tooth recapped, but i thaugth to myself "Things happen". So following up to 2018; i took my son to get a baby root canal, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN, but this time his cap fell off the next Day!!! HIS IN PAIN and they rushed me off the phone saying he has to wait 5 days for him to be seen !!!!!!👎 Family dental is full of workers who are not serious about there patiences!!! And they dont care to help you when its a mistake on there part... I DO NOT RECOMMEND FAMILY DENTAL !!!!!!!!<//text>< Time>

🛑 please stop and think before you go to this dentist🛑 okay so I’ve been a patient of there’s for two years the reviews below is true! The wait is long, the dentist who sees you will only spend about 10mins with you so don’t bother with asking questions. They’re extremely expensive. Okay so here’s what put the icing on the cake for me! I had an appointment at 5:30 I arrived at 5:15pm and gave them my updated insurance information I waited until about 5:50pm for the lady to tell me the doctor won’t be able to see you today he’s running behind on schedule! So you have me waiting for 35mins in excruciating pain only to tell me you will have to cancel my appointment and reschedule?! Very unprofessional I will never return to this dentist again and do not recommend them to anyone unless you would like to experience something like this and all of the other reviewers! Oh and all I got was an I’m sorry but yet your patient is in major pain! I even told them that and they showed no remorse for me at all! What away to waste my time< /text>

<text>Horrible service.
They schedule me an appointment and after I get there and wait for 3 hours, no one had called me, and then they tell me they're over booked,  can I come back  the next day,  and I said sure, then they  called me before the next day and ask me can they reschedule me. And told me to pick a day, so I picked a Saturday,  after I got there, and waited 2 hours, and was the second person there, and they were calling people ahead of me. I just got up and walked  out. This place is very horrible and shouldn't be in business.  Just simply poor management and even more horrible staff<//text><user>106700512355714451119<//user>< Resp>

<username>Novelera 80's</username>< review>
So we r now in Oct they have rescheduled 2 appts since then. So if ur time is important find someone else. Now that I'm going for my second kid I will do my due diligence on all aspects in finding a new ortho.  I will also write to the better business bureau  about their time management.  They really don't care.
If you come here for Ortho, expect them to change your appointment constantly. If you have kids, they do not have a flexible schedule. Only because my ex choose this place I'm tolerating it. I do have a second child that will not be getting her braces here. Parking is terrible people are constantly double parking and blocking parked cars. My kid now has to have her braces on longer than what was expected bc they delayed appts.< /review>

Took over 2 hours just to see the dentist (Dr. Luong)

Started basic teeth cleaning

Didn't finish so they had me make another appointment to come back in because they only had time to do half of the cleaning (still had me pay again)

During the cleaning the dentist was joking about how he was going to fire a few people and didn't want to deal with them while he was opening a new practice in Pasadena

Called every girl in his office "my love" and was generally just creepy

Broke off part of my retainer (attached to the back of my teeth) and instead of rebonding it like any other dentist would have (or has done for me previously) they tried to get me to make an appointment with the attached orthodontist office to get an entirely new retainer and pay an outrageous price. (Instead I went to another dentist who rebonded it in 5 minutes for a small copay).</text>

BEWARE!! SCAMMER/RIP OFF ARTISTS to the extreme! They will tell you anything to extract money out of your pocket and not your teeth out of your mouth! They wanted $650.00 (not covered by my insurance) for a supposed deep cleaning before they would access what they would do for my teeth. They claimed it would take 4 to 6 weeks for authorization from my insurance company for any work to be done. Called the insurance company and they stated it only takes 5 business days for authorization. I told the insurance company what Family Dental Practice told me and the customer service rep even stated: "What they told you is highly suspect and sounds wrong". Long story short, found another dental office that my insurance company recommended, that was honest. They took one look at my teeth and stated I had decayed teeth that needed extraction. All necessary procedures were covered by my insurance unlike what Family Dental Practice told me! STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU LIKE PARTING WITH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES AND BEING TOLD A HEAP OF LIES IN THE PROCESS!!< /text>

I was introduced to this place because of a major accident. A few months ago, my two-year-old son knocked out his front tooth while playing with our neighbor’s kids. Thank God that one of my neighbors saw the whole thing and she immediately called West Coast Dental. (The number was on her speed dial because the same thing happened to her son a while back). By the time I came to the scene, she told me she had made an appointment for him that very hour! I was so thankful because the dentist was able to repair his tooth without any damage!!! I now have their number in my speed dial just in case something like this happens again. After all, we have plenty of boys living in the neighborhood.< /Text>

Even with a long wait time, this office was ok at first. My daughter was treated with no problem. However, my 8yr old son came in with tooth pain and was rescheduled 3 times. Because of his weight the pediatric dentist acted like she was scared to treat him. Becasue of his age the general dentist did not want to treat him. Reluctantly, the pedo dentist said she would treat him, but the schedule was for 2 wks out..We ended up going to another dentist who knew the true meaning of EMERGENCY and treated him the same day...I have since transferred all 5 of my children to the new dentist. Side note: going back and forth with me about this issue with my child sitting in the exam chair was unprofessional and made him feel terrible...DO BETTER.</review>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>Hello, I received a text from this dental practice asking Lanita to rate her experence. I am not lanita so it looks like she made up a phone number when filling out paperwork at her visit. So since I didn't have an,appointment I can't speak for their services, however all I can rate is the quality of the text message I recieved.

I received a very professional text message friday afternoon from family dental practice of Lancaster. It was accompanied by a nice graphic with a soothing maroon color. The font in the graphic was very classy and astetically nice to look at and the message was concise and to the point. I would be ok being texted by these guys again. Their warm words made me feel like family.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Avoid this place at all cost, unless your willing to spend all day there before being seen. I had seen all the bad reviews on here but still decided to give this place a chance.I went in with an appointment at 12 I waited for 3 HOURS!!! I was put in the room had absolutely nothing done and they still had the nerve to come in tell me if I could leave and come back in an hour because the dentist was going on lunch! I left and never went back because of my frustration. Take into consideration I had already had my xrays done and insurance approved at a previous appt.
Prior to that my daughter had an appt at 7am got there on time and wasn't seen until 9am where she was sedated and had to come home without treatment because electricity went out( obviously not offices fault) NEVER AGAIN!!!!<//Review>
