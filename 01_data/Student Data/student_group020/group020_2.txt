I had a good experience throughout the years I’ve spent at spartan. The teachers are very helpful. They’ll go out of their way to explain and clarify. The staff are very nice. The program director Mr. Pleasant was very supportive and helpful. Overall, I learned a lot and earned my A&P. It takes commitment and a lot of hours attending the classes, labs, and studying for the exams but is well worth it. The location is very convenient and has ample parking.< /text>

<Review>I will begin by saying that these are my honest observations while attending Spartan from Nov 2019 through July 2021 (through Covid).  This may be long, but you will find it insightful and honest.
The facilities.  Like most everyone else, I was impressed when I took the tour before I enrolled.  A lot of equipment in two separate hangers looked great.  But after I enrolled and took all the classes, I know better.  There isn't one piece of aircraft equipment that is presently working or isn't missing any parts.  Manuals are disorganized or missing pages.  It is an old school built in the mid 1940's and it shows. The buildings need updating as does the equipment.  I can say that the administration is working on updating the facilities, but it will take a long time to bring them up to date.  Despite the facilities and equipment, it is still possible to learn the necessary knowledge you need to get your A&P license.  This is largely due to a dedicated faculty staff that has gone out of their way to ensure that I get the knowledge I need.
The faculty.  One of the best teachers I've ever had in any classroom setting is Mr Gober.  While he is not a licensed A&P mechanic, his math lessons are entertaining and to the point. The faculty is full of knowledgeable and experienced individuals that are trying to make a difference in your life, despite what is going on around them. I thank Mr Gober, Mr Miller, Mr Rapp, Mr Post, Dr. Boyce, Mr Harrell, Mr Freed, Mr Apollonio, Mr Anderson, Mr Chojnicki, Mr Jordan and Mr Douglas for taking the time and extra effort to make sure that I understood every aspect of the topic being taught.  They are a wealth of information and anyone that tells you different, has not taken the time to ask questions or speak with them individually. They all have different teaching styles, and some may not like the style, but they are effective if the student puts forth the effort.  THE FACULTY FULLY DESERVE A 5 STAR RATING.
Some students attend school, show up prepared, put forth the effort and complete their work in a timely manner.  Others just show up and go through the motions.  Yes, I paid a substantial amount of money to get the education, but I also worked hard to achieve my educational goals. When possible, I showed up early, stayed late and asked questions.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about some other students.
If you have a concern or if you want something done, then you go to Linda Laim.  She is the Dean of Student Affairs and has been a tremendous help to me and most other students. If you ask anyone on campus who they call when they need help, they will more than likely say "Linda" another 5 STAR RATING recipient.  In my time at Spartan, we have gone through three campus presidents.  The first left after the first month I was there, so I did not get to know him.  The second always had time to listen to the students but follow up was limited.  Whether it was because of Covid restrictions, a lack of accountability, or lack of support from corporate is anyone's guess, but the fact remains that there was limited follow up and/or execution that I was able to discern. The current campus president I don't know much about since he's been here about 2 months.  This is his second tour with the school and I am hoping that he can get this school to what we all envision it to be.
Would I recommend the school?  It depends.  If you are a self motivated, willing to do what needs to be done regardless of the situation, then yes.  But if you are anything else, this may not be the school for you as you will feel like most others who have given the school a bad review. I can tell you that I completed the curriculum and I'm looking forward to testing for my A&P.  I am still continuously encouraged and helped by the faculty and administration so that I can achieve that goal.
The school is old and has its problems.  But the school also has a lot of potential (and it is slowly getting better). The school will be what you make of it.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Decided not to go to this school for one reason. The harassing phone calls from your own local area code tricking you into thinking you could be receiving a local phone call from your doctor or some kind of an emergency from a family member. I'm the one deciding whether to attend this school or not so let ME be the one to call back! How else would they have tricked me like this had I attended? If they can't be straightforward with me about a phone call how can I expect them to be straightforward with me when I'm trusting them for my education?</text>< userid>

Attending spartan college was one of the best decisions I've made for myself. The program consists of everything you need to qualify for your Airframe and Powerplant certification exam. This 18 month program was the quickest way to obtain my certificate without the wait at community colleges. Spartan college, Inglewood CA, prepared me for my starting career as an aircraft mechanic and I am very pleased with my overall experience.<//Text>

<Text>Count the cost before you begin. Many start but few actually win. Gaining the knowledge and skill isn’t dependent on how well an instructor  presents information, it depends on the students willingness to pick up the weights day after day.

A lot of time in study outside of class is what separates those who have an A&P and those who don’t.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>The teachers do the most that they can to ensure students learn as much as they can with the equipment they have.

Only draw back I see is the lab equipment is out dated, but Instructors are very well informed and extremely well seasoned in this industry. All the Instructors care for their students knowledge. Other than that everything depends on the student interest in learning. I'll be coming back to spartan college to brush up on my learnings later in the future.< /text>

After I got my certificates, Miss Ethan was very helpful in creating my resume and told me about possible places I could work.

I was 36 years young when I began my A&P course with Spartan. This was the first time back in school since I took my GED exam. I completed my 18 month course with Spartan in 2 years because of COVID. With the help of ALL the staff, from Ms. Ethel Jones & Britney Arriola in career services assisting me with my resume, and finding job opportunities. Ms. Negy Aquino helping me with scheduling my FAA exams. Ms. Linda Laim keeping us safe on campus. Ms. Daisy Ruiz in Financial Aid Dep. making sure funding for classes is taken care of. Our Director Mr. Horace Pleasant! who inspired me and motivated me every time I heard him speak! and most importantly ALL of the instructors I had the pleasure of learning from while in their class. I was able to complete my Airframe & Powerplant Maintenance course of study.<//review>

Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology is a great school that provides students with hands-on training in aviation maintenance technology. Students obtain the skills needed to qualify for FAA certification by using specialized classrooms and technology labs. At Spartan College, students will have the opportunity to experience a rigorous curriculum taught by friendly instructors currently working in the field. The Dean of Student Affairs, Ms. Laim, does an excellent job of developing, implementing, and delivering various services for students attending programs on campus. Furthermore, Ms. Laim answers students’ questions and promptly addresses student concerns with precision and grace, improving students’ overall experience.< /Review>

I was considering to enroll West LA college and Spartan college then I enrolled Spartan. My decison was correct to eroll this school. School program is little fast anx harsh, but after you finish this program, you can get the certificate much more faster than the LA college.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Never stays on topic and has the highest fail rate in the school. How he is still employed is beyond me. I'm assuming the reason the school doesn't have rate my professor is to keep people from knowing how horrible he is.

<review>You can get an A&P license without paying all that money for an education that’s not even close to worth it, After you Graduate good luck finding a job that does not require you have experience in the field already, and also if you need any records you better physically go there to pick them up because once you’re out they don’t answer your phone or even let you leave a voice mail. The staff there is LAZY!!! Please save your money and find experience first</review><gmapID>0x80c2b726f7c6ab77:0xff643d56a87bd1e< /gmapID><name>sannii S< /name>< user_id>

Ive been in the program for about 7 months now and they already have me in the final block. Classes are taken out of order and It’s very unorganized here. I definitely regret enrolling to this school.

By far the worst decision I’ve ever made was to come to this school! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼< /Text>

I feel like I really want to leave this review not only as a former student/graduate, not only as a former employee of SkyWest Airlines, not only as a former instructor for Spartan but as current Dean of Academic Affairs for Spartan. I was an automotive mechanic and knew that I wanted to do something more and came to this school. I heard the same complaints that I have read, but noticed something about the people who were the loudest. I noticed I don't see many of those people in the industry today. The former students I see in the industry, I have seen at SkyWest, at Qantas Airlines, at Space X and Delta Airlines. I also see them in General Aviation repair stations and in many of the manufacturing facilities, (Northrop Grumman, Robinson,  Panasonic etc.) The school's goal is to help you get the Airframe/Powerplant Certification. The equipment that we have is equipment that the exams, given by the FAA, specifically ask about. We will touch on the electric braking systems on current 787s but that won't be on the exams and we have to walk a fine line in between what we want to tell you about the current industry and the data saturation point when taking your exams. We are very proud of our instructors. If you take the total number of time in the industry of all of our instructors myself included, is nearly 250 years of experience. We know what it takes to get into the industry and are very proud of the students that come back and talk at our alumni panels. We're very proud of the reputation of the number of people that take the written exams and pass which would surpass in three months what the local schools will put out in 2 years. (Google NORMS 8080-08).  The aircraft industry needs more than a few good mechanics. You can't get something for nothing. We train mechanics that want to be mechanics. We are Spartan.<//Text>

I only know the day shift which is the one I'm attending.  The instructors are excellent.  Really interested in you learning the material despite the resistance of some of the students.  So far everyone from faculty to administrators have been very good in moving me along and helping me when I need something.< /text>

Started here 16 months ago, just a FYI tuition is already 40k plus.  If your planning on attending the night classes, Forget it. Only two teachers here at night that know what they are doing.  If you've ever heard of buyers remorse, this will basically give you the same feeling. I've already spoken to the president of the school and addressed my issues but not really much was done. ** this place just sucks** if you qualify for financial aid, maybe this is alright for you.. if you dont, get ready to get a large amount of student loan.</review>

A joy ride of an education that led to failing certification exams and denial at aircraft mechanic apprenticeship applications.
After 40k$, one would still need to grind harder than at school just to barely pass, and one would still need to use experience and knowledge before school to pass or fail apprenticeship tests.<//Text>

<Text>I'm reviewing the testing center. I have finished all my classes and went to take a test and Alisha is so dry and questions seem to bother her. I also called and received attitude from her. Im in debt around $40,000 and the service I have received from her is disappointing. It seems like she feels entitled to that position but she needs to be aware that without the students she has no job there. Dr Johnson has changed alot for the better but I feel like a low priority since I finished with the classes. Someone please let her know that she can look for work if she is unhappy there. Alisha called herself momma during orientation but she comes off as a pissed off employee.<//Text>< Pictures>

I don't even know where to start with this place. They are more of a used car sales lot then a college all they do is get you all hyped about it then when you start school here they don't care what you have to say. I have a instructor right now that can't understand English and isn't willing to answer any question we might have for him.  He is very disrespectful towards students.  I wouldn't recommend this school to any friends or family ever. There are way to many horrible instructors and almost zero equipment that is in working order....  to me there should be more available to us as students specially for the bill of $40,000 but who am I right?</Text>

Great instructors. Most people pay around 25k with financial aid. However just beware everything you see in these pictures is bullshit. You will not get to work on anything you think. all parts are old 1960 carburators, magnetos and engines. the planes are half ass cessna 150's. when it comes to hands on be ready to "use your imagination" because everything on the inglewood campus either doesnt work or is missing parts or is out dated.
If youre serious, i mean SERIOUS about your A&P this school is no problem but if youre counting on this school as a career launch pad and teaching you the latest and greatest, save your money and try out the industry first to be sure this is what you want.
Theres plenty of companies out there willing to hire non A&Ps to get your feet wet.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Excellent service!! Excellent food! My family and I have been to plenty of sushi restaurants around the area and this is by far our favorite. The service is great! The manager is always accommodating, he will set out new tables to seat you and check in with your party while you wait. All the waiters and waitresses have been very personable and friendly. The food is great because the rolls are fresh and pretty good size!
The only thing is if you are planning on picking up food for take-out please keep in mind that it will take a little while. But rest assured the wait is worth it!< /Text>< pics>

On Yelp there were many 5 star reviews but after eating and looked at more recent there are a lot of 1-3 star ones. Here's the reason why, the rolls are simply too big some might say that's more food but when eating sushi the rolls should be bite size and not you chocking if you attempt to eat these monstrous rolls. A pro I would say is that the food came out in less than 10 minutes of ordering. The fish for the sushi was 7/10 for freshness taste, but I did not enjoy the added topping that came on the sushi, it's suppose to bring out the fish flavour not overpower it. They have quite a selection for sushi so if you feel like trying something new they got you covered. Ordered 2 rolls, 3 different types of sushi fish, 1 hand roll, and tempura, usually for this amount of food we pay 50-60 but the total was 70, very expensive for sub par sushi. If you want to satisfy you sushi craving this is an okay choice but not the best especially for the price.</text>

<Text>Excellent service but get there early. We had to wait approximately 30 minutes but killed some time in the nearby shops. The food is good and there is plenty of it so come with a good appetite.< /Text>< name>

This is my favorite place to eat. Suitable for any mood. I tend to go most often when im feeling or overwhelmed. The atmosphere is so cozy. Its one of the only places I get hot tea at. It just feels right. I've kinda of fallen in love with this place. The staff, the food. Never a bad experience. It's just nice and uplifting to eat there. The staff is very tentative and friendly. One time I even had one of the chefs give me a little extra eel after I only had rice left to my unagidon. The food and presentation are definitely evolving to a more fancy appeal. It looks a lot better presented than it used to be but the flavor is still as amazing as it was back then. Honestly for me tho it isn't about the fancy platters and stuff. I really love the cozy homely vibe. Almost feels safe there. I can just truly relax. Can be a bit pricey depending on what ur going for but I think its worth it. For the atmosphere,  service, and food.< /Text>

<Review>Vday order so long wait time as expected. 2hour and 20minwait for ordering online (i was told itd be easierthan over the phone). People that ordered in person or outside order were done within 35/45 min (waiting outside so i saw this). Originally i was told itd be 80 min which i accepted. Then when checked kn at 75min mark i was told an additional 30 min. Then told 5 min. So yeah I get that they were busy bur at the same time dont mess yourself up by taling wveey order possible. I feel that online orders were forgotren vs ppl that were in person. Which is unfaie.</Review>< Rate>

Wow, very disappointed to say the least. Came here based on the reviews and ordered a range of things.
The vegetable udon ramen had no taste at all, it was just hot water and vegetables. Sushi itself was quite fishy (i.e. not fresh fish) and just didn't taste good at all, again just lacking some flavor vs. many other sushi places I've tried.

I really suggest the chefs try and taste their own food to see if this is something they would eat and call "Japanese cuisine".
I'm all for supporting restaurants during Covid, but if there is no effort going into the food they serve to customers, what's the point?</review>

Extremely clean & fresh.
Not the usual all you can eat.
Fine sushi. A little expensive if you are hungry.<//Text>

<Review>Nice little sushi place. Nice and cozy. The owner is really sweet and welcoming. Makes you feel comfortable and warm. The food is good as well, fresh sushi. If it's full, you might have to wait a bit, but it's worth it. Good variety awaits you. Stop by, and feel the warm greetings from the staff. You will enjoy it.</Review><Rate>4< /Rate><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<rate>3<//rate><text>I think it’s like, just OK sushi. Then again, I live in Tokyo, so I have pretty high standards. The owners are Korean and super nice— even though we went on a busy night, they checked in with us during the wait.
The serving sizes are very large, so I feel that’s probably part of the appeal. Highly rated as it’s the only decent sushi spot in the area. 🍣</text>< pictures>

I arrive at this special restaurant often  as I like the  special atmosphere that is outline this place. The crew is very friendly and experienced. The service is extraordinarily rapid. Also, the food you get is great. I frequent many times and I was always joyful. The cost is modest. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends.</review>

< Review>
Kazama Sushi hands down the best place for sushi. My boyfriend and I reserved a table at 7. We only waited for 5 mins. We were placed at the bar which is the best seats. My boyfriend ordered a spicy tuna roll and a rainbow roll. I ordered a classic California Roll. The lemonade drinks in glass jars. Loved it. The owner is funny and sweet. The owner came to check on us and talked for little bit. Really sweet owner. The girl employee saw my boyfriend was sweating because he couldn't handle the spicy food. She offered him napkins.  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE.</Review>

They open in the afternoon/evening now for take-out, due to covid-19 restrictions. I don't eat sushi, but have had both their teriyaki chicken and bulgolgi. Both were delicious!! I also enjoy the tempura vegetables a great deal. The owners are very friendly and kind.</Text>

We got 4 rolls when we went, all which were just okay. The fish felt a little warm, almost room temperature, by the time it got to us. We just beat the crowd and a huge line quickly formed outside. The staff politely pressured us to hurry through our meal, asking us several times if there was anything wrong because we hadn't left as soon as our plates were taken away. Still, it was good good and good prices, so I would probably go again.<//review>

Service was a little slow, but the food was so SO tasty! I had the eel and avocado roll, and it was phenomenal, especially paired with the sweet sauce. Their seafood udon is also especially delicious, particularly on a cool rainy day.</text>

I'm still sitting here as I write this. This place is great. The owner, Chris, has a 10 out of 5 stars for customer service. Food was great and came fast. Chris even showed appreciation for my military service. He also is willing to make a roll off the menu if you prefer it a certain way. Bottom line, Chris and his staff are about the CUSTOMER!! And they have my business for good! 👍 Chris and Kazama Sushi, keep up the good work 👌💯< /Review>

Good service, good food, good prices. I ordered sashimi salad. Large plate with 9 very generous slices of 3 different types of fish, large baby greens salad with avocado slices, lots of ginger,  delicious. Shared a seaweed salad,  plenty of seaweed over same gourmet greens, not overly sweet, excellent.</text>

Kazama Sushi, thank you for bringing delicious Japanese food to the Claremont area! I have been a frequent visitor since moving into the Claremont area and have been consistently satisfied by the service, food and affordability of this restaurant.

The portion sizes are generous for everything I've tried. This includes various rolls, the bento box sets, tempura lunch set, and tempura udon. I'm personally a fan of their speciality rolls because of how much flavor and seafood stuffed into each piece. Their tempura is also as good as any other good Japanese restaurant, having a variety of vegetables and shrimp.

Another plus of Kazama is their all-day sake bomb special for $1.99 each. For anyone new to the sake bomb scene, this is a $1.99 combo of beer and sake shot. It's not only tasty but leaves you feeling a little extra happy during your meal time.

Conclusion? One of the best and affordable Japanese restaurants in the area.< /Review>

Standing alone, the food comes out quick, the service is good, and they have all the standard stuff on the menu you want. Comparing this to the average sushi place? The flavors... I think the oyster shooter is the worst one I've ever had (cough syrup flavored), the flavors on the sushi were lack-luster, and there is a poke place next door that has a way better flavor for a cheaper price.

So to be simple, the place is nice, the ambiance is good, good service, i just think for what you end up paying there are better options in downtown claremont</text>

<Review>I took my daughter on a date here because she likes sushi. The food was really good and the service was really good as well. The only thing is that it's a very small place.

<Text>We really enjoyed Kazama sushi. It was really good, and they have very very tasty rolls. The sushi was fresh and it was very tasty. I recommend this to anybody in the Claremont area that wants to have sushi. It seemed a little fresher than King Kong Sushi did across the street.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

This place is really good. I pit stopped here from Vegas to L.A. and got 4 different rolls not only did they taste fresh but they were massive. The quantities of sushi that they add to the rolls is the most I've ever seen.<//text>

Check back for a full review. A bit pricey due to its primary location, food is good. The service while friendly is consistently poor. Once you have your food, forget about continued service.</Review>

<Text>Tried this place tonight it was horrible! I tried to take my girlfriend on a nice date here and we were shoved in a corner. She ordered chicken teriyaki and it was so burnt she didnt even want to eat it. We also had empty water cups for about 15 minutes. But they were super quick to bring us a check. They lost valuable customers tonight< /Text>< username>

The hamachi sushi here was not the best I ever had, but definitely good. Worth the occasional visit when in the area if I'm missing Japanese food.<//Review><rate>4<//rate>< UserId.>

Atmosphere_Small but has a decent decor to it.

Food_ My 3rd favorite spot. I dont care as much about price when it comes to a sushi spot. I prefer quality. Jalepeno appetizer,  very yummy.

I am Sicilian and I love good food. we went to the restaurant in Abdalla or waiter was hands down the most relaxing best waiter I've had in probably 3 years and I eat out every other night all over the world the service was a 5 the food was a five in the dining experience all together was quite nice it's definitely a must try< /review>

Super attentive staff!
Even though i don't necessary enjoyed my roll, i still gave it 4 star for the great customer service!

My poo and I decided to get sushi and walked through the back and was immediately seated. The lady noticed the table was moving ( i didn't even noticed) and she quickly fixed it. We decided to start off with sake bombs for $2 each and even though it was just the two of us it was soo fun!

My favorite was the fried tofu steak, i could of just ate that instead of my rolls. For some reason it had this odd after taste!

My man also felt his sushi was subpar but once again the attentiveness was undeniable ...so really this place deserve a 3.5 star overall.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) You can eat authentic sushi at a store run by a Japanese person, which is rare in the area.
Not only the standard sushi, but also sashimi, grilled fish (salted yellowtail if you remember correctly), miso soup, and beer were all eaten with the same taste as you would normally eat in Japan.
Also, I ate California roll for the first time, which I can't eat at Japanese sushi restaurants, but it was delicious.
By the way, I was able to order in Japanese normally because the shop owner responded. I remember that the shop owner was a friendly person and the correspondence was very good.
I stayed there for only 3 weeks, but when I was tired of eating only American food, I was very happy to be able to enjoy the taste of Japan.
* Information when visiting in 2012.

(Original)
現地では珍しい日本人の方が経営されている店舗で、本格的なお寿司が食べられます。
定番のお寿司は勿論、お刺身や焼き魚（記憶が正しければハマチの塩焼き）、お味噌汁、ビールにいたるまで日本で普段食べられる味と全く変わらないものが食べられました。
また、日本の寿司屋では食べられないカリフォルニア・ロールを初めて食べましたが美味しかったです。
因みに、店主の方に対応してくださったので、普通に日本語で注文できました。店主は気さくな方で対応が凄く良かったのを覚えています。
現地にはたった3週間の滞在でしたが、アメリカの料理ばかり食べてて飽き飽きしていたところ、日本の味を堪能することができて非常に良かったです。

Always a friendly smile at Chico. Mike, Pam, and the rest of the gang will make you comfortable. Service is fast and plenty of seating. Mike takes good care of his crowd. Games, music and many TV's line the bar, Very nice selection too. The best place to be during any sporting event.</Text>

Tommy the bartender, along with Pam attend to your beverage needs. Air conditioner is cool on hot days.</Review>

It use to be a cool lil spot to go for a few drinks & listen to the music / karaoke. Ownership changed & so did everything else . Alcohol & beer selection is minimum. You walk in and the place is dead on a Saturday night. It was 9:30 pm and there were just 2 ppl in the bar & the bartender.< /Review>

I planned a somewhat last minute wedding when my original date was postponed due to COVID.  When I brought in a picture of a cake I loved from Pinterest, Timothy's Bakery was absolutely fantastic and was happy to help.  They created the exact cake I wanted and I was thrilled with how beautiful and delicious it was.  I would recommend them to everyone!</text>

Their champagne cakes are pretty good, but other than that they're Over rated! Yes it's been a staple in the Woodland community, but that's about it. Over priced for below average doughnuts.
Ordered cupcakes for my wedding and they were not only hours late, they tell me "we normally don't deliver any order like this so you should be thankful we did" NOT the best customer service</review>

Love this place. Their champagne cake is amazing. They did my wedding cake in 1986. Any and all occasions we order one and drive in from Sacramento to pick up. Same owner since late 1970s and the quality is the same. #Incredible<//review>

I've been going to Timothy's Bakery for their famous Champagne Cake and donuts and coffee and other things in the cooler since around 1997. They are a magic of their own, a true original. Sometimes service is a little slow, but only because they are laid back. Never had them be late on an order, always had cheerful service. Very personable, and excellent food! Try the Baklava if you get a chance!<//Review>

Best butter flake rolls on earth! Thanksgiving dinner isn't complete without them. Parker house rolls are also delicious, I eat, and share them, straight out of the bakery.<//text>

Made a fantastic custom cake for my son's 5th birthday party, and great customer service (please excuse the scrape marks under the lego man's eye- it was humid in my house and the eye leaked a little, so I scraped it off. No fault of Timothy's, all me!)< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I don't like tres leches cakes, they give more bitumen than bread. They are not good.

Los pasteles tres leches no me gustan, dan más betún que pan. No están buenos.</Review>

<Review>Everyone is very professional and very polite. Rates are very reasonable. I reserved online,, went to the office to get my info and by the time I got the truck and movers to my unit, there was a manager there in a golf cart to make sure we we able to get in and settled. I have to move a lot for my job, so I need to store every so often - I used them before, had a perfect experience,  so I used them again. I'll see them again for my next move. Highly recommended.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Sorry I'm not sure how i managed to vote 1 star. i don't consider myself to be computer savvy so I'm not sure how to change it but i received nothing short of GREAT customer service from Chris the day of my rental. I only needed my garage room for one month but i will surely consider renting here in the future. And i appreciate the girl calling me to see how they could improve service based on my previous feedback. Speaks volumes on your management. Two thumbs up!</Review>< pictures>

To be honest I prefered the previous owner because they kept the place cleaned. My storage is right by the house and I feel they use the blowers toward the storages versus away and it bows dirty into the storages and my storage looks like an abandon house with 20years of dirt/dust.<//review>

<text>I stored at this facility prior to it becoming security public storage and loved the owners and staff. Update, still love the new owners and staff. No problems with the facility or handling business they give curiosity calls before late charges. Currently due dates are dependant on start date vice 1st of the month mandate. And yes I was in the struggle during a portion of my stay which the owner actually asked if I was ok and if I needed help potentially more than once but not more than twice and definitely out of care and concern. Would store here again in a heart beat and if I'm in Fresno look forward to it!! Thank you thank you SPS!< /text>< pics>

I like the fact that they remember me by my name. They always ask about my family and it has a comfortable atmosphere. The place is always clean and open when I need to go there.< /Review>< gmapID>

This storage facility is very nicely kept and clean.  They have a variety of sizes to rent and all are well protected to take care of your belongings all year round. You must provide your own pad lock so keep that in mind when it comes to your actual rental time. The property management team is very friendly and helpful. I am very happy to add that this storage facility offers on site pad lock cutting by the management should anyone lose their keys.  Of course with all proper information and identification being verified before hand. And they also provide locks on site to purchase to replace that broken lock. So everything that is an incredible inconvenience can be taken care of as quickly as possible with minimal time and effort to you with expense being taken in mind.  Great company with a good heart!< /review>

I would also like to mention that the manager, Cindy Pryor, to be very professional and honest.

DO NOT TRUST THIS BUSINESS!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!

If this place has so many cameras and such great security, then why weren't the thieves caught on camera? That is perplexing!!! Please do not think referring your customers to the insurance company is helping them out. They do not replace or compensate for all stolen property and try to rip you off. Having trusted a place and getting robbed only to be  patronized with an insurance pamphlet is very frustrating. So save your "sincere" apology and stop lying on your responses and take responsibility.< /Review>

<Text>My favorite place to get fast, friendly,  reliable service. I like the fact that I call and order our favorite pizzas such as Italian sausage,  Hawaiian,  supreme, cheese and the classic pepperoni pizza. Delicious wings and crazy bread with marinara sauce. And when I get there dinner is ready!< /Text>< pics>

Pizza is great, the place is almost always packed. The best way to do it is to place order online and just pick up at the inside pizza portal.< /text>

<review>At the beginning  this establishment prepared pizza very well, but in recent days they make the most horrible pizza I have ever eaten in my life. It's really disgusting, poorly cooked, the wings don't have enough sauce, and they don't follow the order instructions.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

They are always closed early. I go there at 6 pm and sometimes they are closed. Why do you even bother keeping a franchise if you can't even update Google about your times???

This is the fourth time I've been disappointed by this specific store. Whoever manages it is doing a terrible job.<//Review>

Worst customer service I live in Texas and someone hacked my little caesars app and place an order for pick up at this location. I called for almost 15 minutes and got nothing but a busy signal then when I finally got threw they said there was nothing they could do and I would have to report my debit card stole. I asked them to at least pull the food from the portal so at least the people stealing from me wouldn’t get the food and they did sorry e can do that because they come and get it themselves. I exploded to her yes I know but I don’t want the people trying to steal from me to get the food and all she said was well sorry they already got the food. It had been over 30 minutes since I had first started trying to call them and getting put on hold twice.</text>

They messed up our order, my husband called, and they told him we would get a free pizza and crazy bread. He went in and told him that he had to buy a pizza and get the bread free. And she argued with him that she never told him he'd get a free pizza. Not the first time they mess up our order.< /Review>

This is the best Little Caesars around!  I live off La Sierra and go out of my way to come here. Their pizzas are always great. Lots of sauce. They even answered the phone before they opened at 9:30 to take an early order I needed by 10:30. This place is pretty amazing for a Little Caesars.</text>

Most of the employees are a bunch of high school students who doesn’t give a damn about quality and good service. Order one extra most bestest pizza and was told to wait 10 mins. Ended up waiting over 35 minutes because all of them were too busy talking to each other. A young tall blonde girl seems to be the one in charge (I’m assuming she’s the manager) she also sucks! She lacks professionalism. Won’t ever go back there, had the worst experience ever.<//Text>< Pics>

So I'm standing in line waiting to order and I decide to take a photo of the place for my review and some girl in the back named  Melissa says to me no pictures well anyways  I get my pizza and looked around and saw no sign for no photos. PIZZA was good 👌 but I'm going to La Sierra location next time</review>

They always get my order wrong and after i try correcting them there's been  times that they once again get it wrong, very annoying and they take forever to give you the pizza. There hot and ready are always either burnt or jave spots with missing cheese and spots where the bread is extremely  thin and hard. Definitely  will not be coming here anymore even if its 3 mins away id much rather drive out to a different  little  cesars.< /Text>

First time here and really bad experience if there were 0stars i would rather perfer giving this place that i had a phone order and they didn't even had my order done when i got there they were barely making it. Why wait custormers wait. Also they check if they had a pizza similar to my oder to give me that one instead real bad. It's understandable if they were busy but this place was empty! Also they charged me as a way different price pizza when i order a deep dish and she didn't even know why seriously ridiculous< /Review>

< Review>
The ice cream flavors are good. I’m a big fan of matcha so I need to try out this place right away when I knew about it. If you cant choose between their matcha and sesame signature ice creams, it would be a great idea to have a combined swirl. They provide spoon to help with scooping the ice cream from the cone. A water station is also provided with lemon ice water. The seating area outside is very cute and the lighting makes it even cuter at night.

Highlights of the menu:
1. Matcha ice cream
2. Sesame ice cream</Review>

<review>As matcha lover, this is one of the best places I would recommend.
The flavor is absolutely RIGHT 😊 It is not too sweet or artificial. I have ordered the soft served matcha with sesame  duo. The texture is smooth and milky. The two flavors blend very well. Lot of matcha places is hit or miss because they just can’t get the fresh, crisp, not too bitter but not too sweet flavor. My hubby ordered the sundae and it was another level because the red bean, corn flakes, and rice cake was the best combo.  The presentation of the ice cream is so cute that you just got to take a picture and share it on your Instagram story. Covid 19 makes us sad but having a cup of ice cream especially the terrace right in front of the place is nice place to hang out. Although there weren’t lot of people, on regular times I bet there are line of people.
Location: Old town Garden Grove

Parking: Plenty of spaces

I'm not a big fan of matcha or black sesame, but I did enjoy their iced Japanese black tea with sweet cream! My friends got the ice cream and really enjoyed it, though because of the heat it melted really fast and the cones kind of leaked!<//text>

Located in the back of a local Garden Grove bar/arcade called “Barcode,” Mr. Matcha is Matcha do about softserve.

Sorry about the corny joke, but they play up the puns here — e.g. sign that says “How Matcha do you love me.” They don’t mind IGers and even post photo-taking tips.

Most of the seating is in the outdoor patio facing the large parking lot in back of Main Street.

I had a Matcha green tea/black sesame swirl soft serve on a black cone for $4.95 before optional tip. The softserve tasted good, but slightly icy. The black cone is more of a novelty if you ask me and I didn’t care for the cinnamon notes in the cone — I’m going to skip the cone if I revisit.

Free parking and they have a water station and restroom.< /review>

1st time here. Had trouble finding the place. It's actually located behind a restaurant. You wont see it driving from the streer. Lots of parking available here. Their ice cream sundae with mochi and red bean balls are delicious. Also their ice cream cone (two seperate flavor blended in one cone : matcha and sesame flavor) is a must definitely worth trying. Im going to be coming back here often to try other stuff on their menu.< /Review>

<Text>i like this place a lot, i actually helped shoot a friend's engagement here and the employees were super cool about it. Granted, we came at a time where there were literally no customers around, but i've seen people get kicked out of places for less. So thanks.

Also, the soft serve is pretty yummy. I was surprised by how much i enjoyed the black sesame because i usually hate that flavor. Overall, I liked it a lot! Service was nice, place is chill and relaxing!</Text></record>

It's a little hard to find (back of the Barcode Bar) but it has a nice patio seating area and access to restrooms. Their service is very fast and friendly and they serve their product well. My favorite is the ceremonial Matcha float (which is their Matcha green tea with Matcha soft serve on top and i add black sesame cone crumbles). I drive all the way from Chino to enjoy my Matcha float at least once a month so hope this place stays open for a long time.< /Text><UserId.>117371205864609036621< /UserId.><name>Brenda Velasco<//name>< pics>

Hello team,
I'd like to bring up few points in terms of operating business as a whole. I came here the first time because of its marketing advertising. It's very appealing from the pictures. I am appalled with the customer service. It was plain unprofessional and obnoxious in every way. The location was poorly. It was difficult to find the place. Overall, the business is not presentable as well as the staff member. I suggest in the near future your company should be looking into how to improve in training your people properly. How do you bringing customers without a smile on your face? The drink isn't all that special to get 5 stars.</Text>

<text>The ice cream was good. Personally I found it too sweet which distracted from the good matcha taste. The cone was good but I felt like it had a weird gritty feeling at the end.

No complaints about the ice cream which is very good.  Service good as well.  However, the price is not right.  It looks like we're getting lots of ice cream for the price but what we got were swirls of icecream built up to a heap on the outside and all hollow on the inside.  Thus the 3 stars.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd2809bb41260b:0x6320bf6bf65ed293< /Gmap_id><response>None<//response><pics>None< /pics></record>

I've been here 2 days in a row! Cool organic soft serve joint behind a bar. I love matcha & sesame so I had to try them plain & came back the next day to swirl it!

Matcha Green Tea soft serve on day one lived up to my expectations. You can't go wrong with matcha. It's not too sweet & hits the spot if you want to taste the cream of your ice cream & matcha powder from your green tea.

Sesame Soft Serve tastes just like my favorite hot sesame dessert but this one happens to be cold in a cone! It's nutty & gritty just the way I like my black sesame! It's a bit on the sweeter side so if you don't like sweet then order a swirl to balance.

Matcha & Sesame swirl is the perfect combination of milky cream, nutty sesame & matcha. It plays different textures & flavors on your pallet & then mixes nicely together to get that unique taste that's less sweet because the matcha down plays the sesame.

My black cone was perfect on day 1 but it was stale on day 2. I don't understand why but my besties & I were all disappointed on day 2 because it ruined the mood as we got to the cone!

UPDATED TO 5 STARS ON 8/26/17: My son saw my foodie post on my IG so he asked to go try the Black Cone here. Their wish is my command! I would never tell people how I feel because I want them to experience it first hand with their true feelings & own judgement!

The Black Cones were perfect today! But best of all was that my baby girl just asked for a little cup to taste her sibling's Matcha Ice Cream. The server felt bad so he gave my daughter a full cup for free. I didn't expect anything for free but this really made my 7 year old daughter feel special because it's going to be her 8th birthday soon!

Mr. Matcha has the best soft serve & services because the best employees are always happy & cheerful! They never fail to ask me how my day was going!< /Review>

Small selection, big flavors! I always get the sesame and matcha swirl in the black cone. One time, they gave me a sample of their corn-flavored ice cream and I died. It was so delicious! They don't have special flavors all the time, but I don't mind because I always get the same thing anyways. ;)<//Text>

The entrance it has a very peaceful sort of look to it where you can hang out and talk. The inside had less seating from what I could see, they had free cups with water and the ordering station. The black sesame ice cream was a good portion and it was great tasting. Tasted a bit like toasted peanut butter to me. Good first experience.</Review>

Matcha soft serve here is the strongest I've had yet, and I love it. Do not get the ice blended roasted matcha. Instead, try the matcha milkshake. I'm hoping they use their soft serve to make this because I want strong matcha and creamy smooth texture.< /Text>

<review>The best matcha soft serve around here by far! The texture of the soft serve is so smooth and creamy, and you can really taste the matcha flavor! If you're into black sesame, the texture/consistency is the same, and the flavor is (overwhelmingly) strong! They also have a milk flavor, which I like, but for some reason, it always comes out melted/runny. I think it's because of the machine they use, but it hasn't been fixed the last few times I went soooo, lol.  A little on the sweet side, but it's a nice contrast to the matcha. Definitely a must visit for any matcha fanatics!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Black sesame and Matcha Ice cream are both delicious.  The matcha iced latte was good, but not sweet enough for me.  My husband liked it because he prefers less sweet.  The Hojicha was good.  I don't think I'll be back often because I think it's a bit overpriced.<//Text>

Friendly and quaint shop. Delicious soft serve. I'd recommend getting just the matcha instead if half/half. The sesame kind of dominates.</Review>

<review>The Black Seasame is amazing!  However it's a tad rich to finish a whole cone by itself.  I would recommend getting a swirl with the Matcha to balance it out for a wonderful dessert!

I also recommend the Pandan drink they have, fun twist on Vietnamese and Japanese favorites.< /review><userid>110508914998282258009< /userid><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

Also if you look closely, all the photos show the ice cream in various stages of melting. This soft serve melts faster than any I have had. It literally can turn into a complete liquid state in a couple minutes. The other thing is the girls behind the counter do not fill the center. It is all air in the middle. Maybe they are trying to save a few cents on supply costs. Came another time and they made it taller with still the air bubble. This place is ok. Only go if you are near GG.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>It was fine.

They were out of cones on a Monday, and their fence out front is broken (probably from a car backing up into it).

The cup price was $5.12 with tax.

They are located in the back of a bar, but you aren't allowed to walk between the two by a sign to the effect of "not an entrance. Please walk around the side of the building and sign in." I think it was attached to a "wet floor" sign, or something similarly sized.

Only come here if you really want a matcha or black sesame ice cream, but there are other places you could probably go to instead.

I hear that a SomiSomi is opening in Garden Grove soon. SomiSomi has comparable flavor quality in their matcha and black sesame, but they aren't going to run out of their gimic ice cream holder on a Monday night.

Seriously, if you run out of cones at an ice cream place, that just goes to show how little you care about your business.

It's just... fine.

Do you want to spend over $5 on fine?< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

TL:DR - Matcha ice cream with black sesame cone is the way to go. Matcha latte float is a waste of money.

Went in and ordered two things, the matcha latte float and the matcha ice cream with the black sesame cone.

Matcha ice cream: definitely the thing worth coming here for. Got the traditional green matcha, brimming with flavor and tasting of actual matcha as opposed to the gritty, powdered flavor you can find elsewhere. Nice soft texture, served at the right temperature that went well with the black sesame cone. The come itself held up during the entire treat, not becoming overly soggy throughout the experience. 5/5

Matcha latte float: extremely disappointing. Tasted like I was just drinking milk. Tried mixing the matcha ice cream into the latte to try and save it, mixing the rich flavorful ice cream with the dull, tasteless latte, but to no avail. I ditched the latte halfway through and begged my girlfriend to share her ice cream with me. Waste of your money. 1/5</Review>

Eh, its crowded, the other side is a loud, weird bar full of strange people. The icecream is mediocre at best, and the areas uncomfortable to exist in.
A great place to visit after drinking on the other side of the building all night.<//Review>

So delish. Great matcha flavor, not too sweet or creamy. Tastes like frozen match a tea. Black  Sesame is yummy too, this one is more creamy and sweet, but yummm</review>

My daughter kept talking about this place so we finally drove down to Garden Grove.  I have to tell you that it was really, really good.  The girl at the counter was so sweet, she let us bring our dog in to order our ice creams!  First, the matcha was excellent.  Not too strong, but subtle.  I took the mix of matcha and black sesame and I loved the two together.  It was the first time I had a sesame ice cream in a black cone and I will definitely go back for more.  My daughter took the sundae, matcha & sesame with red beans.  That too was really good.  It's a cute little place, hidden off the main street.  It's actually on a small side street that we missed but found when we walked down the main street.</Text>

Never take your shoes here ever!! I took my $800 dolce Gabbana shoes worn only once to be cleaned. I picked the $42 package which is 2 tiers away from there highest package. I only wore them once on my birthday and spilled cola on them. The laces were the dirty part and some on the sole. They cleaned the laces but the sole still had a stain. But that's not the issue the issue was they damaged my shoes very bad. The entire back where it says dolce Gabbana with leather was completely creased and ripped. I showed them they said they did not do that. I told them these shoes were worn once and they told me I'm lying and it was worn much more than that. If you're a sneaker head or love your designer shoes don't take it here. I wish I read a couple of reviews before I came complete messed up my new kicks. Oh ya the  manager was no help at all not even an apology</Review>

Awesome service. Parking in plaza validation. Would have liked to get the same day service but they were backed up. Would visit again. It's a good shop with good guys there. Very smooth transaction process overall. I was pleased with my shoe cleaning.<//text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Sneakerheads...do you ever ask yourself..What’s better than cleaning your sneakers? As one who has tried endless products and spent more time than I’d like to admit trying to preserve my most beloved footwear, this place has it all in one. I’ve used Jason Markk for years prior to finding out there was a place to bring them to. And they do amazing work. You will be pleasantly surprised by the way they are able to revitalize as long as you are a realist and know that things like cracked souls or leather won’t just go away with a good cleaning. I still use the products at home and wish they had another (or a few more) location besides in LA. It’s a little more work than dry cleaning clothes, so of course it costs more than just steaming a shirt, but the process is similar in that you drop them off and they come back looking crispy. I’d give 5 stars if they had a loyalty program or other ways to save $ for returning/regular customers. As someone who likes to have mine cleaned regularly, it would make sense for both company& consumer. Plus the protect spray doesn’t live up to the hype or cost IMO. But great concept, service and all around turnout of all the 👟I’ve every brought here.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>really friendly, amazing, helpful staff that will help you and that are amazing at their job. personally trust them to take care of my shoes and to sell amazing products that will last you and make you a loyal customer. this shop alone is an amazing la privilege to enjoy. my personal story being that they helped me with a defective bottle cap from the jason markk cleaner that spilled all over my bag in a really amazing manner. they definitely have my support and will be telling my friends all about it!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I called them the day before yesterday. I needed to repair my shoes. They did not answer, then they called back and recorded my contacts. When I came to them they said that my contacts were not. I had to record again! After the repair lasted for two days, I took the shoes and was unhappy! Bad place. I do not recommend!</Review>< Pics>

Great experience at the Jason Markk store this afternoon. Walked in to drop off my Ultraboosts for a cleaning and Jonathan quickly cleaned them while I waited! They look so much cleaner now! Quality service.</text>

Had some issues with a product from Jason Markk and they were very unfriendly and downright rude when talking on the phone. They need friendlier people picking up the phone. How damn hard is it to be professional and friendly to customers? Isn’t the whole point of a business is to keep customers happy and keep them coming back? shame , shame , shame.</Text>

If you have some sneakers that have seen better days, you may want to drop them by. They should be able to bring them up a few notches. They aren't miracle workers, but they will do a better job than most at bringing some life back into your shoes.</review>

<review>I'm only giving it a 1 star review because one, I call asking a question about my package & john decides to hang up. I call him back a second time he answers & I ask the same question which he was about to hang up until I told him that I dont appreciate being hung up on. I then said if you guys haven't shipped my package I can pick it up now that I have time. I hate leaving g bad reviews but a "give me a minute" or a "may you please hold" would be much more appreciated. I get it for a person to hang up if it's the DMV but at a place like this that real bad. If he did it to me, he most likely has done it before.</review><date>1552082448081<//date><Name>Marcos Cruz< /Name><UserId.>116996889361109856545< /UserId.></record>

If you a sneaker head this is a must use and roladex must have. Came to LA brought some kicks to get cleaned and they didn't walk through the process they even will consultant on what they think is needed and no up sale. They definitely will expand and grow.<//Text>

<review>Wasn't satisfied with how my shoe turned out
They said that they can't take out the deep stains but how come I did ?
I feel like they didn't even try there best to clean customers shoes !
My shoes came out fades and rough when I picked them up today !
Over they cleaned the uppers somewhat good and took out easy dirt stains but not what I wanted gone from the shoe !
I do not reconnect Jasson mark if you have heavy dirt stains especially on suede</review>< Pics>

< review>
We were driving through town on our way back to Oregon and hungry! I looked this place it up and don't regret a thing. My husband had chicken fried steak (they were out of gravy so substituted brown gravy). He eats a chicken fried steak wherever we go and gave this a solid 9/10. It also came with eggs, hashbrowns, bacon and toast. I had the French dip sandwich and fries which was also amazing. The waitress/daughter was a joy and it sounded like her mom was the cook. Stop by on your way through- you won't regret it!<//review>

This spot is my favorite. I go to plenty of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very welcoming and the food they serve is so tasty. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent meal in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.</review>

<Text>The Auction Yard Cafe is the place to eat while in Alturas! The wait was a little long because of the smaller kitchen, and only seats about 30 people at a time.  Floor was a little stucky... but meh, not a big deal.  Food did not all come out together but pretty close, it was hot and fresh! Wendy our server was amazing and kept up with the rush, and made sure we were all doing good.  Coffee was a bit strong for my liking, hot coco was really good! Very highly recommended!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8dMSCudKctLjbxB--Ji8U8lUUXoC9UiPNDB1N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN63slxvwscoyzez3eQwRPT1jd02lFzd5IB1aHT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnif3k8MumYjNoBYiMy5yOF4rtNyJ2TwNa4TpD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9vAB5JlLf17y_t2RboXxdm05Uo4fm5eSzG59I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbfEcBWekPbz7ZdJxpoakImTkqUUCwtHalw1Jg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDMayBi6dNWkXVXzuPMD7xVrIuCPTIjM7jdW5U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyhsOXr7BIZHwa8ie2B2Y--BkTRFn9UhGes6Y9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO63-EGFfWC4po5EdZyOeoIMc4YMHSTa-jxy09y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqDcbIWJH6bfcDK0MZ2gaMKBbj2zLr7Qv06BBH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM53nLl7oAFaIXnJqXYINr0nZnCBhU3VS1OVFlb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Mom must not have been in her groove this morning. The gravy was a bit lumpy and the eggs were over cooked. But the service was excellent. All in all it's a good place to grab some homemade food made like home...😊💖<//text>

The ham wasn't as salty as you would buy in the store and just the right amount smokeyness to it , eggs done just the way you ask for them. Keep doing what your doing we'll see you next visit.</Review>< Pictures>

Order the Garbage Burger! Has all the fixings on it with a huge side of fries. A real big bang for your buck. Usually real busy over meal times. Great place for the working man to grab a bite and hit the road. Took my wife there for breakfast, and she loved the omelet. My biscuits and gravy was old fashioned goodness. Friendly staff. Family owned. Go there on a Saturday and get in on a cattle auction!< /Review>

Great old fashioned food!

To the patrons (or potential patrons), make sure you bring cash. They do not accept cards.

To the owners, you should really accept cards and get a decent merchant account with low fees. You should put up a large sign that says "CASH ONLY!" outside the building for people that had never been there.

At the least, have someone put an ATM in the place.<//Review>

It only takes Cash or Check. That was kind of inconvenient because I had to go to atm. Besides that food and service 5stars.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Wowser, this place may be small and it might not look like something you'd find on Main Street but they sure do know how to cook. Had the very best burger in years cooked fresh for hubby and me a few weeks ago.  The meat was fresh and tasty and the patty hung over the large bun. Mmmm, I wish they were closer to my home, I'd go back every week.  The breakfasts we eyeballed looked great too.</Text>< GmapID>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>The food is pretty good. You get a lot on your plate. It is on the greasy side but tastes good. The coffee is weak and not to hot. The service is friendly. The cook is the Mother and the waitress is the daughter. They have a hired waitress on Sundays. If you leave here hungry, then it's your fault. They do hold cattle auctions right next door so don’t expect the eating area to be very clean. It is a little run down inside but the food is pretty darn good. I recommend you not wear your good clothes as the chairs are worn and dirty. But the food is good and the locals like it.< /Text>< pictures>

We love it! You're treated like family and we've never had anything but an excellent meal. Whoever wrote that review about needing to wear dirty clothes needs to go back to whatever snobbish city they came from.<//Review>

They were pretty busy this morning but the staff was working hard to make things happen. We waited quite a while for our food but we were in good company so it wasn't that big of a deal.< /Review>

<review>We wanted to order for pick-up while travelling back from Death Valley.
We called 45 minutes in advance from the car while on the highway. Once there, they had not validated our order (on purpose, but without telling us on the phone...). No apologies of course, and we had to wait 20 more minutes, like we never contacted them before... I am really not used to give bad feedback, but this time, if I could put 0 star, I would.</review><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

Best Pho in town! Come enough times, the owner memorizes your order and always feeds you the best pho! Egg noodles are my favorite and if yours is the rice noodles, just ask and they'll change it 😊. I've been coming here for over a decade. I went to college at Bakersfield College and my friends and I always went here. Of course I've tried other places but nothing beats this place.</review>

I want to begin with saying the food was great, delicious. I ordered chicken pad thai, Chicken Fried rice, chicken soup, 2 Shrimp rolls and 6 dumplings. I usually do the math while looking at the menu. Once again the food was fantastic but after looking at my receipt when paying and doing the math when I order - I usually add myself a $10 on because of taxes- but it didn't add up. Basically I was charged way more than the prices on the menu. $68.95. Alone for 3 jaritos and two Thai teas was $19.50. That doesn't make sense.< /Text>

The pho broth was on POINT! The people here are from Da Nang, VN and that’s where my family is from so I’m super impressed. Tendon was crunchier than I like but that’s just my preference, still amazing.

Side bar: this restaurant has been here for 15-16 years. I can’t believe another VN spot opened up right next to it. That’s some BS. With their deals to lure you in. You know a legit Vietnamese joint when their hand soap is pink, you can see the mop out in the open, and the menu has BBH. Support the OGs!

Went during covid and they kept their restaurant clean and maintaining protocols.</review>

Asked for take out.They gave me hot pho broth my beef and veggies on the side, ingredients were kind of frozen. They told me I'd have to cook it up when I got home
Never again coming here again. This is why I hate trying new stuff it's always a disappointment<//text>

Good veggie pho with generous portions. Only wish the noodles weren't so bloated/stuck together. Would have been the best end-of-a-long-roadtrip meal ever< /Review>

Best Pho in Bakersfield and surrounding area. Everything is made with fresh ingredients,  nothing frozen or from a can. Staff are polite and inviting. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out.< /Review>

<user_id>103554664442809846363<//user_id><Review>Would not recommend this pho restaurant at all. The portions were very small, waiters were unfriendly, and the food was absolutely disgusting. I was very disappointed with my visit here. Upon my arrival, I came across a dead roach under my table. Shortly after ordering, I took a peek inside their kitchen and nearly threw up. After receiving my entree, the noodles not only stuck together, but also tore apart because they were so soggy. The broth had no authenticity to it. Need I forget to mention that the woman who rung me up did not give me my change but kept it and placed it into their little “tip jar.” DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Go visit Maui Pho on Ming Ave for an outstanding experience.</Review><user_name>Miranda Moore< /user_name><Rating>1< /Rating><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80ea6a4b84ffcf77:0xea6c30e423e9bdda</gmap_id></record>

<text>I have been going here for many years. I have noticed pho has been getting more popular over the past few years here in Bakersfield, and more and more noodle shops have opened up. Still to this day this is by far the best. The owners are very nice and take the time to make sure you're well taken care of. And the quality of the food is as always amazing. If you are interested in trying really good Vietnamese food than this is the place you should try out.</text>< pictures>

I'll make this short and sweet. BEST PHO IN BAKERSFIELD. HANDS DOWN.
Ask for the house special with spicy broth and add brisket and ask for both egg noodle and rice noodle together.
Also, order the shrimp and pork spring rolls.
You're welcome :)</text>

Well I liked my food but my friend wasn't satisfied with her food. She wanted to exchange it for something else but they wouldn't do it for her. She didn't eat it and said she wasn't paying. They started yelling at her called her stupid for not asking about what she was getting. They video taped us as we were leaving.<//review>

<user_id>114848446501799714678</user_id><text>We were driving through town and stopped by for a quick early dinner. Unfortunately my experience was not as positive as most of these reviews.

The lemon grass fried chicken wings was overly salty, over-cooked and I wasn't able to make out the lemongrass taste. Their fresh spring rolls was OK, but was on the smaller side of what we're use to (probably because it had very minimal vermicelli). The Bo Luc Lac (steak cubes) wasn't what we're use to; this meat was flat (should be tender steak cubes) salty and tough.   The Clay Pot Rice is just a name and it felt more like they put cooked rice and the ingredients in a clay pot and re-heat it for five minutes (if it was truly cooked in a Clay Pot, it should've taken at least 15 minutes and you should have some burnt rice on all sides of the Clay Pot). The Pork Chop Rice plate was not memorable. The pork chop had a cardboard texture, very dry and full of coloring instead of the charred color.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is the best Pho place in town.  There's a lot of love put into the broth.  This restaurant is very busy, even during times that are usually slow for other restaurants.  The downside of this restaurant is that it is on Union.  I would go to it more often otherwise.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><date>1488859964742</date>< user>

<Time>1508916317399< /Time><rating>1< /rating><text>Ordered 25 eggrolls via phone for pick up for potluck at work.  I clearly said eggrolls a few times since the boss lady kept asking me to repeat it.  She then asked what kind of meat filling I wanted and I said I thought there's only 1 kind of filling.  She said she has shrimp and pork and she will do it however I wanted.  I was confused and just agreed to shrimp and pork.  When I arrived, I had to wait another 15 minutes since she was busy with customers.  When I was about to pay, she gave me spring rolls.  I told her I asked for eggrolls, but she kept saying I said spring rolls on the phone.  She said I should have spoken Vietnamese while ordering if I wanted her to get the order correct.  Since when did u have to speak Vietnamese to eat here?  So instead of admitting to her mistake, she turned around and blamed me for not ordering correctly.  She argued with me in front of other customers and didn't apologize or offer any discounts for the mistake she made.  I ended up taking the spring rolls since I had to bring something to the potluck.  Spring rolls were ok, but peanut sauce was very watery.  I will not be ordering here again due to bad customer service and low food quality.  I've been eating here a lot and at their second location so I was very disappointed in the way I was treated.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This place is nasty. The pho tasted ok-good (it was my first time) but after the lady grabbed the basil and brussel sprouts with her bare hands from our table when we said we weren't going to use them anymore then gave it to another table, I will never eat there again! I understand not wasting food but how many times has she done this? And why not use a plate?? That's not very sanitary at all. I'm shocked they have an A rating especially when they had little bugs crawling on the table we were sitting at...in fact, they looked like fleas. Also the shrimp fried rice smelled like a dirty, wet dog.<//text>

It's a relaxing taste.

<review>Rosa, said she was site manager, phoned me yesterday and was unbelievably insensitive to my family.

Very sadly, my beloved daughter passed away suddenly.  The entire family is attempting to handle her business as best we can.  My daughter had a storage unit with Public Storage for a couple of years.  Apparently, rates went up recently, but the family did not receive notice, because of so much moving around.  Bottom line, I sent check for amount we had been paying, but it was incorrect.  Rosa called me and I sent another check.  Unfortunately, the second check should have been $9.00, but I made it for $7.00.  With my bad eyesight I mistook the "9" for a "7".

Just so you know.❌< /review><user_id>113245619089829153443<//user_id></record>

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a beautiful smile and a pleasant feeling. Rosa was amazing and made my day. Had to rent a storage unit and I was all over the place because what I was going through. However, Rosa made it so easy for me from start to finish and made me feel at easy. You can’t find that feeling everywhere you go. Thank you for having Rosa at that location.</review>

<review>We traveled all the way from Fresno to get into our storage. We made it here by 5 PM and they supposedly close at 6 PM. Nobody answered and the door was locked and we tried calling several times. We will have to spend the night and try again tomorrow morning. Very unprofessional.<//review></record>

<review>I came in looking for information on storage Rosa helped us, she was very helpful and friendly. When we walked in she greeted us with a smile and provided all the information we needed. She went above and beyond trying to help us and offered a variety of boxes along with other supplies that we will definitely be needing. We will be coming back once we're ready to start packing.</review>< user>

<text>Rosa and Francisco were so helpful.  I was referred to this location by Shay, whose location did not have the size available that I needed.  Rosa showed me exactly what size unit I needed, signed me up and I was out the door in less than 30 minutes.  They were so nice and professional.  Highly recommend.</text>< Name>

<review>I needed to get a storage unit ASAP. I was able to walk in and lock in a storage unit with the help of Rosa Francisco. She made the process fast, smooth, and painless.
It's been about a month since I got the unit and haven't had any problems.</review>< userid>

<review>Andres is the best! I’ve been storing with public storage for a couple years now and have seldom had any experience close to the A+++ service andres always gives. He is a true gift to the team and needs the recognition he deserves. Andres is always attentive, patient, and always makes sure the customer feels welcome and heard. He is the best there and I will continue to be a customer of public storage as long as he is there to assist me.

<text>Went into this location to ask about pricing and received the best customer service from Francisco. Francisco was very knowledgeable about his units and what will work for my needs. Great security at this property and was very clean. Was able to get a unit and move in all my items the same day. Francisco really took a lot of stress off me. Would recommend this public storage and Francisco to anyone who needs storage.< /text>< Rating>

I was at my unit today and couldn't close my door,  Rosa was driving by on her cart and offered help. She showed me the problem and helped me close my storage properly. This team is always ready to help out. Love to see that someone is always driving around ready to help. Gives me piece of mind knowing my storage is secure and the place is always clean. Came in to make my late payment today, I wasn't feeling good and the staff showed concerned even offered me a bottled water. Now a days with everything going on a lot of people dont bother with you, the staff here is always attentive to their  customers. Thank you</review>

I cannot thank Andres enough for the service he provides when I come there. Andres is always so friendly and sweet mand makes sure that I have all my needs taken care of. Any question I have he can answer and and problem I have he can address. He truly is a star worker and makes my experience at this location something I look forward to rather than a hassle. I hope your manager reads this and sees how much of a talent you are and a serious asset to the team. Many other worker have not given me the same amazing service Andres has and he continues to make my day every time I come.< /Review>

Francisco and Rosa really helped me with getting a storage at an affordable price. Once I found out I needed to move out of my house so much stress was on my mind. Didn’t know where I was gonna put all my stuff while I found a new place to live. Stopped by this location and was greeted with warm welcoming smiles. The property was very clean. Stopped by to find out prices and what I needed to get a storage. Francisco took me to see the unit and made sure space was big enough for all my stuff. He gave me all the information I needed and helped me sign my lease. Unit was very clean and ready for me to start moving all my items in. Didn’t know this process was so easy, if I would of known I wouldn’t of stressed so much.< /Review>

I had a terrible experience with this facility. Many negative aspects, beware. The place is infested with rats and mice which are inside the storage units (see pics of droppings.) I reported the rodent infestation to the on site agent, who offered to rent me a different storage unit, but told me I would have to pay a transfer fee and move the items on my own! Public  Storage is the largest storage provider in North America with over one BILLION dollars in annual revenue. The CEO earns millions of dollars per year, yet they don't spend any money to maintain these storage units. Take a look at the pics I posted - the rubber seal on the bottom of storage unit doors are badly cracked and worn out, resulting in excess dust gets into the storage unit. The rope you pull to open and close the door is torn and came apart. When I first rented this unit I made a reservation on Public Storage's website at a price of $145 per month. When I got to the facility I was told the cost was $218 per month (exact same size unit.) This was a classic bait and switch. Furthermore, at the time of original rental I was told I must buy the extra insurance at $11 per month. I will never do business with Public Storage in the future.</Review>

Updating my review after I got my storage a couple of months ago. Francisco and Rosa and all the staff here are so nice. When ever they see you on the property no matter what there doing like cleaning around the property they stop to greet you and make sure everything is working out well for you. The property is so big and always so clean. Couldn’t of choose a better location to store my belongings then this one.</Text>

<text>First time getting a storage unit and I was real skeptical about putting all my precious stuff inside a unit and lock it away. But Francisco and Rosa had all the answers to all my questions. The property was really clean and the units was really clean as well. Jocelyn called me when I made my reservation and was really nice and kind over the phone and answered my questions I had on the phone. I would really recommend this place to anyone. I visited other storage places before choosing this place and because of the service and the cleanliness of the property I went ahead and choose this one.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dd35cc02fea3df:0x35798f107f5d2ce1</GmapID></record>

Came in today for gate code I was attended by Rosa and Francisco. We were unable to open the door and they came out to help also offered to change the rope which was really helpful. This team is always ready to help and very friendly. Location and restrooms are always clean. -Stopped by today to purchase boxes Rosa was very helpful as she usually is. Great customer service every time<//Text>

< review>
Rented a 5x5 unit a while ago for $75 a month. After a few months they raised it to $99...
Besides they are not friendly nor competent, they probably have a policy not to help customers - or at least try very hard.
Today is my favorite! They changed the code w/o informing me. I had to go to the office to get it, which wasn't easy because i didn't had the code to get out of the gate.
There was not even a chance that lady was going to move from her chair to bring the new code to me. Great Customer  Service Public Storage!
I will move out of there before my stuff is stolen (happen to my storage neighbor today) or the price is going through the roof.

I hope you guys get more competition so you have to work for the $$$ you are getting from us customers!<//review>

Francisco and Rosa are very polite and Knowledgeable of there storage and merchandise. They offered me everything I would need to keep my belongs safe and ready to use again once I move back into my house. It was very hard choosing a storage to secure my items. After looking at reviews and many different locations,I stopped by this location to see why they had nothing but good reviews. Francisco and Rosa reassured me, this was the place to store my belongings. The property was very clean and I would recommend this property to anyone.</text>

After having to move and not ever needing a storage I have to say that my experience with this mess was the easiest part thanks to miss Rosa and a young man Francisco had been very helpful and patient with my hole ordeal I'd have to thanks public storage. Came back in for boxes and with all the renovations going Rosa and Francisco were great even while being in a trailer. They were busy with customers but not once did they seem frustrated or annoyed instead they gave everyone great customer service as usual with a smile. They make every visit worth my stop even when I'm having a bad day. Great job, great team.<//review>

Francisco and Rosa has great customer service. Francisco was very knowledgeable of the storage units and the kind that would best fit our needs. We were offered boxes and tape. We bought the tape and tape gun. Rosa helped us to assemble the tape and tape gun considering we had some difficulty because this was our first tape gun purchase. Thank you Rosa for everything. We appreciate the friendliness and helpfulness of this staff; at this location.Very clean location and great fees for storage spaces.< /text>

Been storing here for a while now. I could not have made a better decision on where to keep all my precious belongings. No matter what time of day I come to my storage or come to make a payment I am always helped by a young man named Francisco. He’s always so polite and patient. Every time he sees me or other people he always ask how is the storage working out and to let him know if he can make anything better for them.<//review>

I went to Public Storage asking for Prices and I was helped by the Manager Rosa and She made me feel very welcome. I liked the way she Stood up when I entered the Office and How she gave me all the Information to needed. I loved it so Much that I rented a Storage even when I was asking for Prices. Big Shout out to Her and Her Crew for keeping the Place Clean.< /review>

<Text>I visited public storage last week to pick up packing supplies and ask for more information based on what storage size would be best for the amount of things I needed to store and I received amazing service from the property manager Rosa . She was patient with all my questions, polite and answered all my questions with detail so that I would get a better idea of what my best options were in terms of packing supplies and unit sizes. The customer service I received here was great! Highly recommend everyone to come to this location. I don’t need storage just yet but once my escrow closes my husband and I will be returning.< /Text>< Pics>

Let me tell you all about this place, I’ve been renting here a couple weeks now and the young man and the property manager that are always here are always active and very welcoming. I came in this morning to put some boxes away and they were already at work cleaning the facility. Oscar and Rosa keep up the great job!<//text>

Most of the staff here are Great! They are informed and willing to assist with the most bizzar of situations.
Shay came straight to me, instead of clock in, to make sure customer comes first and stayed with us until ALL issues were addressed and resolved.  I don't think she ever clocked in to work.  Service like that isn't around much any more, refreshing.
Driving up to your units is great! From your vehicle straight in to your units cannot be missed.
The only down side is there hours of operation , they close early 6pm.
I give them high marks< /review>

I had such a wonderful experience at this Public Storage location. I've been to other Public Storages, but this one is the best yet. The staff, Leslie, Cesar and Rosa were so kind and helpful. I rented for 6 months, and everything was perfect! Everything was clean, which is a big thing for me. I definitely recommend this Public Storage!<//Text>

If you need a storage unit, I would definitely recommend this location. I had a storage unit with a different company, and I can say I've never experienced better customer service, than I have here. Rosa, Leslie, and Cesar were extremely helpful with the questions I had, and were very nice. My first time being a customer for Public Storage and I definitely feel cormftable to ask more questions if I need to. The area is kept clean and the bathrooms are too. It's a pleasure to come back every time. Great customer service!<//Review>

My girlfriend and I have a unit at this location for almost a year and the staff is excellent.  We are living between friends and family, it's been a difficult year but every time we come to our storage the staff has been very helpful and friendly. They are very understanding of our situation they call and show their concern for us and our things in storage. We've been here to see how other customers talk to them and they still keep a smile. We really appreciate everything Rosa Cali and Juanito do. Thank you very much, we'll be sure to recommend to anyone that needs storage.< /review>

She even had to call her boss to help me in the best way she could and she did it while not skipping a beat! I am not one at all to write reviews but at a time when I felt so overwhelmed it was pleasant to have such understanding and service.

<Review>The service at this particular location was awesome! I was here at 9:29am, the doors opened at exactly 9:30am.. I was in and out within 15-20 minutes, Leslie and Cesar explained everything so well which made the transaction very smooth for me, especially since I have never done this before, and that's exactly why I gave 5 stars. If anyone needs a storage unit, I will totally recommend this location!!! Awesome staff.</Review><GmapID>0x80dd35cc02fea3df:0x35798f107f5d2ce1<//GmapID><user>101102062700126965139<//user><date>1387821663907<//date></record>

My storage unit is always extremely dusty near the door opening on the inside of my unit. Dirt and dust blow in under the door and it is a dusty  mess when I open it.  A few years ago, they had mentioned that they spray the perimeter of the buildings to control undesirable insects. But inside my unit there are often Daddy Long Leg Spiders and one time I was deep in my cluttered unit and when I came out.. There was a thick Black Spider on my pants leg. . When I first rented my unit, they were charging me $189.00 per month plus insurance and other fees they tack on. Each year they raise the rent a significant amount. I've had my storage  unit 5 years and I'm now paying $375.00 per month. Plus fees and insurance, etc. In that same period, I've gotten a total of $0.11 cents pay increase from my job so you can see that my Public Storage Rent is now eating up  up a significant percentage of my monthly income. I really need to clean it out and vacate the unit because I can't keep up with their large annual rental increases. I wish the units were under Rent Control.

This place is a rip off. They raised my rate every quarter. What started off as a $65 monthly introductory rate became $190 after two years of storage. The place is filthy, especially the bathrooms.< /Review>

<text>We have been customers of Public Storage for many years and recently we needed to downsize our storage space.

Leslie & Rosa the Public Storage girls helped us with the move allocating a space across from the old one. They also made all the paper work easy for the new space. We had been dreading the move but Leslie gave us all the good advise. Thank you girls.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I just moved from Vegas and needed somewhere to put my furniture. I arrived at the office and was geared my Rosa and Nieshia they were very friendly and helpful. I had a storage reserved but was very small. Rosa was very helpful showed up the next bigger one and was somewhat big. I wasn't sure on the price she offered look around for other stores but by this time I was already frustrated. I left and was very unhappy with the service i was offered at Extra Space do I came back and rented with Rosa and Nieshia they made this move easy for us. Thank you ladies.</review>

Rosa, Shawnae, Juanito great service. We only had a few minutes to get storage move in and get to the gray hound bus. They were great they got us taken care of right away, they worked together as a team. They were busy with other customers and were still able to help us get out in less then 30 minutes. The location was very clean and they were very friendly and helpful. Best experience so far and made our day easier after the rental.< /review>

Sitting outside waiting to make a police report as I wait on the manager to get here. They changed my unit locks... removing both and replaced them without giving me notice. They won’t open the unit and are asking me to purchase a new lock AND pay them to remove the locks they put on!!!<//review>

<text>I have to say that it's weird for me to review a public storage but the service I got was so great that it motivated me to to it.

Leslie, Cesar and Rosa went the extra mile for me.  I only use storage to store Jeep Top during summer time.  Of course I lost my key, needed receipts printed, had 1 day to get my top out... all kinds of obstacles that are my typical plot in life!  Thanks to these three I got everything I needed and laughed throughout because they are funny too!  I'll be going back in May next year when I need a place to put my top!  Thanks guys!</text>< Pictures>

Someone broke into my unit and went through my things. The manager didn’t bother to call the police. I don’t trust this location and I’m looking elsewhere. Although I stored my classroom materials, it really hurts when people are insensitive.< /text>

My uncle Erix came in today to rent a unit Rosa was very helpful. She was very nice and spoke spanish which is even better that way I don't need to come with him ever time. She offered him a really good price for his unit. Thank you for the great customer service Rosa and thank you for being bilingual. I know my uncle will be in good hands with Rosa. Plus she has a beautiful smile.<//Text>

<Review>The management staff is rude and generally not helpful at all.  Billing mistakes are common.  Customers for 30 years makes no difference.  Crack heads rent out the units and live in them and management has no desire to get rid of them.  All in all, the place is run by jerks and you're better off at A1 in all honesty!

You can't email in 2016?  Really?  F Off!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>115524371977331508332< /user>< response>

(Translated by Google) I would like to say that I am a person who has a large establishment. I was in need of expanding the storage area. I was recommended by a family member to this Public Storage service. When I arrived at the establishment I noticed the very clean area and the service provided by the manager named Rosa and her assistant Oscar, were without a doubt very outstanding, cordial and beneficial towards me. Without a doubt, I recommend this place for its service, security and professionalism.

(Original)
Me gustaría decir que soy una persona que cuenta con un establecimiento de tamaño grande. Estaba en la necesidad de ampliar el area de almacenar. Fui recomendado por un familiar a este servicio de Public Storage. Al llegar al establecimiento me di cuenta de el area muy limpia y el servicio brindado por la gerente de nombre Rosa y su asistente Oscar, fueron sin duda alguna muy sobresaliente, cordial y beneficioso hacia mi persona. Sin duda alguna recomiendo este lugar por sus servicio, seguridad y profesionalismo.</text>
