My childhood theater.. remains my favorite place to take in a new release in the BIG screen.  Excellent comfy lounge recliners! Real butter on the popcorn! Need I say more?  Oh yes great management and staff, friendly courteous always refund or offer a rain check should you have to leave suddenly or it’s some pathetic Hollywood drivel you simply cannot bare to watch !  Another Fairfax hidden gem😎<//Text>

<Text>I always enjoy going to Fairfax theater. It's got a good selection of movies, adorable, and good amenities. The chairs are upgraded, and it's a really fun night at the movies. I wish I was in town more often for $2 Tuesdays.< /Text><date>1581186742698< /date>< GmapID>

<review>The seats are comfortable....but, sound quality is terrible and projectors are not framed correctly plus dead pixels!!! I just went to see 1917 and I was extremely disappointed by the sound, that I have to spend another $15 to watch somewhere else.
Not coming back until speakers are properly calibrated or upgraded, same with the projectors, and the staff.<//review>< Date>

Awesome new seats and theater upgrades!
Splurge for the reserved seating for am totally different movie experience.
Kick back in roomy chairs with your feet up and enjoy an adult libation!
The new choices are there!
Spacious aisles so you can actually move around during the movie without squeezing by your neighbor.
LOVED THE NEW UPGRADES!<//Text>

Love my hometown theater!  I recently took a large group of children here and at the same time another camp was seeing the same movie.  The manager treated every child kindly and with respect as he was serving one after another at the concession stand.  His patience was remarkable.< /text>

<review>The reclining seats and the cozy theatre space were great! The service was so-so. My daughter and I were a few minutes late to a matinee. The ticket seller was in no hurry to sell us our tickets, so we lost a couple more minutes of the beginning of the movie.<//review>< GmapID>

Great place to watch a movie while we visited couple weeks ago Fairfax town it's really close to downtown and our hotel, we liked that have solar panels so we went to support green energy business , the only thing that I will improve is the air system, we went to a late show but the smell of popcorn was not  a welcome door for us, a bit of over smell in the room.</Review>

<Review>Great theater. Excellent incline = easy viewing. Comfy seats with retractable armrests with cup holder. Often shows popular movies in two screening rooms, making for lots of time options and less packed seating.
Great popcorn, relaxed staff, pretty good free parking. Near restaurants, book store and coffee places. Mellow neighborhood.<//Review>< Pictures>

I Highly recommend the management get your staff on cleaning everything like they need to when it isn’t busy to upkeep a nice presentation for this theater.<//review></record>

Terrible service and long chaotic lines every time I go now. Used to love this place, no more.
Don’t care about the lounge seats, and you can’t tell from the chart when you choose that what looks like an aisle seat actually requires you walk in from the other end, as there’s a rail blocking.
But the worst is the very long lines and not enough staff the last 3 times I’ve gone. Today (xmas eve), ticket sales were only inside, so there were two long lines (one for concessions) in a very small lobby - so just a big scrum. Very slow, after standing in a non-moving line for quite a while I gave up and went to another theatre.
Too bad this place is terrible now, and stopped using real butter too.</Text>

<date>1413408584161<//date><rate>3<//rate><Review>The movie theater is adorable.  It hearkens back to an era where theaters had red velvet carpet and red crushed velvet seats.  Small theaters make every seat a good one.  Excellent modern equipment bring it into this era.  HOWEVER, teach your staff a bit of customer service, or at least good manners.  Wow!  We weren't greeted.  We were made to feel like we were an inconvenience to her day.  And goodness, would a pleasant smile KILL YOU??  Yeah.  Don't go here for service.  Overlook it.  Or maybe drop off a copy of Stephen Covey's "How to Win Friends and Influence People."  I don't know.  But oh, well.  The movie was great!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I like this theatre because it's walkable and has a small town feel.  It's also awesome that it's solar powered.  Unfortunately, the new theatre has a loud floor that is very noisy when people walk on it during a movie.  And, more than a few times the this theatre has had some soundtrack issues, once resulting in a refund for the entire auditorium.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808590a8cc1f23eb:0xc076b60b5b3081ba<//GmapID></record>

I'm so disappointed in my hometown theater!!! The last 2 movies I've seen there in the last 2 months were a terrible viewing experience. The colors were washed out and several times during the movie there was a weird digital flash interruption. Hence the 1 star. Till I hear it's been fixed I'll be going elsewhere.<//Text>

Unfortunately, I find the new recliner seats boxy, clunky, and uncomfortable, which kinda wrecks the experience. No other option, although I guess I could carry in a chair of my own?

Also, next to impossible to hold hands or lean next to my sweetie. I am also not a fan of the whole reserved seating thing. Makes it hard to walk in and grab a seat, and I can see how it would work for some folks. I will be going to a lot less movies there.< /text>

<Text>Have loved this theatre since 1980...almost 40 years of various upgrades (rocking chair seats), downgrades (if you consider the loss of single screen a downgrade), and maintenance (clean women's restrooms at all times...nice.)  The pricing is good, the management must try to hire local kids since I seem to recognize many of them from seeing them walk past my home on their way to and from Drake, and there is always a family selection.   It is my second favorite movie house in the area (especially as I can walk to it in 10 minutes).  (My favorite is Monte Rio, which is just too funky to believe.).< /Text>< pics>

It's a pretty decent little cineplex with great digital projectors. The prices are good, the concessions almost reasonable, but the parking blows. The  theatre itself has a tiny little lot off the to left, but once it's fill, it's every man, woman and child for themselves. On most nights downtown Fairfax is pretty packed, and with limited parking for the entire downtown area, it only compounds the problem. It's not a reason to avoid the place by any means, just more of a cautionary tale. Expect to do some walking.< /review>

The upgraded seats are a plus. There is now reserved seating. I usually take a blanket and cozy up. Yay...they now serve cruelty-free butter. Wish they would sell non-gmo popcorn though AND more vegan snacks like in SF. Tuesday is all-day matinee price.</text>< pics>

I recently saw the James Bond movie Spectre with friends at the Fairfax Theater 6. The picture was good, but the audio had a constant low level buzz throughout the film. It was unpleasant to sit through. Then, to make matters worse, as soon as the end credits started to roll the house lights came on and the screen went dark. No credits = big no-no. ONE STAR for the Fairfax Theater 6 for giving us one of the worst experiences we've ever had in a movie theater.</review>

This guy is amazing! I was locked out of my car and I called. He was upfront about pricing which was great. He was super quick and the process was easy and painless. Thank you so much for making my day!</review>

Alex unlocked my garage door quickly and also helped me correct the garage door tracks so the door opens smoother - he went out of his way. Highly recommend.<//review>

Went on yelp in search for a locksmith and I am thankful I found Alex! He came promptly to my home and programmed me two key FOBS for an exclusive deal! He’s very: professional, funny, knowledgeable, and friendly. I highly recommend you call him for your locksmith needs! He’s not your typical scammer locksmith just in it for the money, will be coming to him for any of my locksmith needs!< /Text>

Got locked out of my house the other night. Their good reviews are genuine and well-deserved! Although I was anxious about being locked out for the first time, he arrived promptly and within 15 minutes, I was back into my house. Thank you for the kind, excellent, and quick service!<//review>

<text>Great service and great price. Some one tried to steal my 05' GMC Yukon and they broke my cylinder lock so I couldn't turn on my truck. So I called Alex and he fixed it in no time. Great guy, super fast service. Would recommend to friends and family.</text>< GmapID>

<Review>I found a locksmith in my area who is trustworthy, friendly and very professional. Alex helped me rekey all the locks in my new condo and I am so happy about his service. He even has his license posted in his truck. His price is really reasonable. I will definitely recommend him to my all friends and will hire him again if I need a locksmith for my cars or my house.
Thank you so much Alex :)<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b448d1e7c58b:0xb5581cc219d10100</gmap_id>< username>

<review>Without a doubt, A-1 Qwikfix is the BEST in the South Bay!  Even though the keyhole was damaged and had a drill bit broken inside of it, they quickly removed the damaged knob and saved the day!  Saved me at 9pm on a weeknight.

It is nice to know that there are still honest reliable professionals. I called for a quote, got a price and when I got there, the price didn't change. He did a great job and I will be using him in the future. I am a lanlord so I am always in need of a good locksmith, and I'm glad I finally found one.< /Text>

While searching for a trusted locksmith to fix my 2004 Chevy Tahoe's broken lock, I found a lot of positive reviews for Qwikfix. Alex, the business owner, immediately impressed me on our first call. Where other companies quoted me a price without asking any pertinent questions, Alex made sure to truly understand the problem and was very clear with what parts and labor could cost. Alex was very responsive to my requests,  was prompt when arriving for the service and provided clear communication on the process of fixing the lock. And his pricing was very reasonable too! I definitely recommend Alex if you need assistance for any of your lock problems. He is now my go to guy for all my locksmith needs.</text>

Alex is the best and most helpful person I could ever call. He charged me half the price others were quoting for opening up my car and making a new key to crank the engine. He even troubleshooted the situation and found an old abandoned broken key in the keyhole of the trunk and saved hours of effort for himself and agony for me. Also, a thorough gentleman and a clear communicator.< /text>

<Text>After spending weeks searching for a descent used car I almost gave up until I happened to walk by The Lot so I went online and found a nice Toyota Camry for just under 5Gz...I immediately called and Ted the owner was so awesome and had me meet him at The Lot...Such a wonderful human being,  he wasnt pushy, and he didn't ask me how much money I had as most car dealers do. He made the offer on a beautiful 2005 Toyota Camry and I jumped on that deal...he made me feel so comfortable, he did not take advantage of me being a woman who knows squat about cars, I felt like we were old buddies and I totally love my new used car and I highly recommend stopping at The Lot if you are on a budget....
THANKS TED, YOU MADE MY DAY, AND I CANT STOP SMILING AS IM DRIVING!! KUDOS<//Text>< rating>

I went to The Lot because I had read some great reviews about the owner/operator Ted and I’m glad I did. I was looking for an affordable and reliable vehicle (Teds specialty) and he sold me one! A great and dependable Toyota Corolla. I am so happy with my purchase. Ted is a great guy, he wont steal you wrong. He’s proud of his reputation as he should be. He’s a really honest businessman. So instead of having to worry about some sleazy car dealer doing you dirty just head on over to Ted he’ll do you right!< /review>

<Review>Ted,the owner of the shop was cool patient and waited for over an hour or so just for us to get the car my son wanted! Because my son had to go back home and we live in Los Angeles, so I appreciate Ted's time and understanding and my son got the car....thank you Ted.< /Review>< pics>

1. Looking at cars at 1pm
2. Nobody showed up
3. Ted came out asking from office and talking to a customer from 100 feet away
4. My friend joined me and he asked what the differences between Toyota and Ford for high and low pricing. Next, Ted started yelling I am the owner and I can put any prices I like. Stating this is my business. Then Ted climbed up to his office without any more response. I decided to leave the place🤢

i. Customer service 0/5

ii.  Cars collection: 1/5  quality  (Toyota Corolla, mileage 210k, 5000 is it cheap?

iii. Would you buy : No, I dont recommend if the owner yells at customers

Now your decision to buy or not from here</text>

The Lot Auto Sales provided my family and I with the utmost respect and care when we purchased a Nissan Versa for our daughter. The friendly owner, Ted, was efficient, courteous, and knowledgeable. He made us feel so special when he explained the paperwork process in a way for us to fully understand. My daughter liked that the car was extremely clean and polished and smelled brand new! We totally enjoyed the car buying experience and recommend to all potential car buyers to pay a visit to THE LOT.</Review>

<text>This was a great car buying experience. Ted was wonderful very helpful and actually listened to our needs and then showed us a few vehicles that met those needs. We found a suv that fit our price range and we worked out a deal that we were both happy with. This was truly important to Ted that we left with a vehicle and a deal we were happy with. Highly reccomend this place to buy your next vehicle</text>< Date>

The owner was very nice and he helped me find the best car for me. He didn’t act like a salesman he listened and we pick out the right car for me.

This is a wonderful place to purchase a used car. Ted was very helpful and made my car buying experience a pleasure

Best part is that he will take care of the DMV hassle and smog check for you.

. I found a good looking car at a very reasonable  price

Enjoyed doing business with you Ted< /review>

Ted is not only a great businessman,  he's a great person.  When I went to buy my first car on 03/05/2016, he was very informative.  Not a lot of people take time out of their day to explain anything to anybody. He doesn't want to just make a sale just to make one. He made sure I knew about all the major things you should know about maintaining a car. I'm still driving my car happily today. I will have to go back to him to buy a newer car when I'm ready.. I'm struggling to do so since I'm so in love with my FIRST car and I don't want to let it go. 2 years strong.  :) I definitely recommend buying a car here.< /review>

<text>Ted was great! He was honest, always available and I got a true “no BS” deal. Best part was he took care of all the DMV stuff too! He came highly recommended as he has been in business a long time, and now I know why. I couldn’t even get a hold of the sales people at other dealerships. Ted was always there, answering the phone or meeting me. My car is running great and I couldn’t be happier!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1519762021936, 'text': 'THANK U FOR THE REVIEW IT WAS MY PLEASURE TO SERVE U..

My girlfriend and I travelled from Australia and needed an inexpensive but reliable car to travel the country. Ted recommended a car and assisted us through the transaction process, as well as the registration and insurance. He is a genuine guy and everything he told us about the car was correct. The vehicle has been very reliable and the minor issues we have encountered we revealed before purchase. I would recommend Ted and his yard to anyone.< /Text>

<Review>I just bought my son a pre-owned Honda Civic from The Lot Auto Sales in Long Beach about 3 weeks ago. It is very difficult finding a used car that is in great condition whether its from a dealer or direct from owner. I was confident in The Lot Auto Sales in finding the right car for my son and for me and my wife to have the security that the car will be reliable knowing he is in a different state. We were more than satisfied with the price and great customer service. i recommend The Lot Auto Sales!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1507837352090, 'text': 'THANK YOU JOE..

Teddy hooked us up. My 16 yrs old daughter and I took a trip from Ok to Cali. We bought bicycles and rode all over. When it came time to head back home we discovered the car rental one way to another state wss $738. I searched used cars nearby on Google and Teddys big head popped up. What a great guy. He kept The Lot open so we could have enough time to get there on our bicycles and see what he had. He gave us several good choices of dependable cars. We were hot from the ride and Teddy gave us his last bottle of sweet tea. We left there with my daughters first car and drove well over 1000 miles back home without any trouble. Thanks again Teddy!!! Mayweather going down!!!</review>

<Text>Came in for a drink for my best friend's birthday on a Monday night and the bartender was rude and turned her back on me when I was trying to ask her a question. While we were sitting at a table she ran after a customer then yelled at him. She seems to be very uptight. It's really sad because we wanted to have a good time but the vibe was very weird and uncomfortable.< /Text>< user_id>

The original Vacaville dive bar. Always a good place to hang out or just stop in for a drink. The crowd is usually springin a good vibe and the staff is among the best anywhere. Come for the drinks, stay for the people!< /review>

Got my drink spiked and I'm pretty sure it was the bartender. I look young and he kept asking for my Id so the last time he did I gave him attitude. It took him that much longer to give me my beer . Next day I've puked 20+ times. Fat Asian guy. Will have a lawsuit once my bloodwork comes back<//text>

Best dive bar in town. They have drinks. They have pub games. They have a patio if you want to smoke. They have hard working bartenders. Get over yourself if you expect more</review>

Limited beer selection. No IPAs on tap - just a Heretic Evil Twin. Pool tables are free, however there are only 2 tables. Very dark interior.< /review>

It was great. It reminds me of good burger the movie how the burgers looked looks just like it . Fries extra thick and crisp is just nice. Free refills and food price has good deals. They have corn dogs for 1 dollar now .<//text>

I've been a customer at this Tom's since I was about 15 years old, I'm 38 now. I left Huntington Park 12 years ago and I'm back on vacation visiting family and friends. I stopped in to get a cheeseburger special and to my surprise it's the same owner and staff :) I walked in and hey remembered who I was awesome!

Awesome food, great price and absolutely a great family atmosphere< /Text>

<Review>I went in yesterday December 11th, 2016 at around 9:00 p.m and ordered a pastrami sandwhich combo with the fries turned to chilly cheese. 15 minutes later I received my order with regular fries, I let the order taker know. I received my chilly cheese fries 3 minutes after in a super smaller amount. When I arrived home, I tasted the pastrami sandwhich, and it is the SALTIEST over all food I have ever tasted. It is so horrible in saltiness that I had to throw it. All for almost 14 dollars. Worst restaurant taste test ever.<//Review>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Although the hallway to enter the bathroom has double doors should think about remodeling the place since it is located next to the kitchen, the food well the fast service, in addition they have to have change so as not to lose customers, cleaning needs more observation

(Translated by Google) First time I visit this place. I asked for an order of pancakes to go, but 5 seconds later I told the lady who attended me to add 2 eggs to the order, that annoyed her and her tone of voice indicated that she was upset or upset because I changed the order. His look wanting to disappear me.
The moment he called me to give me my food, he gave it to me in a bad way and almost on his back. 😡😠 I'm not coming back anymore. Saturday June 2-18

Primera vez q visito este lugar. Pedí una orden de pancakes para llevar, pero 5 segundos después le dije a la señora q me atendió q agregara 2  huevos a la orden, eso la molesto y su tono de voz indicaba q estaba molesta o se molestó porque cambie la orden . Su mirada queriendo desaparecer me.
Al momento q me llamo para darme mi comida, me la dió de mal modo y casi casi de espaldas. 😡😠 No vuelvo más. Sábado junio 2-18< /Review>

Very efficient. Good pre screening by nurse and quick but patient walk thru with Dr on the conditions. An EKG test was required and despite all that entire appointment took less than 30 minutes. Impressive. Kudos team.<//review>

This doctor is friendly, a great listener, and has an easy manner with patients.  I was nervous seeing him for the first time because I loved my former doctor who left her practice.  There was no reason to worry, it was a good match.  Helen Evers<//review>

Dr Bunten was very kind, attentive, and had a high level of regard for our daughter's medical history. He was attentive when listening to our narrative and we didn't feel rushed at all. He was good with our daughter, too; Katie is very shy but she felt at ease right away with Dr. Bunten. I'd highly recommend Dr. Bunten - I'm going to try to make him our PCP for the whole family!< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have to share my bad experience with the staff there. Dr. Bunten was great but his assistance was unprofessional and rude. I was calling to make an appointment on Friday. His assistance Vanessa picked up the phone and told me she could make one on Tuesday. I told her that I was not available for the time she proposed, and can she check Wednesday and Thursday. She said there was no availability and you should go to an urgent care. I said if that is the case can she provide me guidance to ease my symptoms (i.e. OTC medicines). She said no. I said if you are not able to, can you check with the nurse or the doctor? She said no, just go to urgent care. She was rude and impatient. I have never experienced a clinic with staff who refused to talk to the doctor about my situation and provide advice.

The above message was posted earlier.

The practice manager contacted me to learn the situation and she would take actions to fix it. I appreciate the response and believe they are trying to make it right.<//text>< Date>

Amazing food! This is a definite hole in the wall in my hometown La Puente! Great food and friendly staff. Majority of restaurants you visit pre heat there (already cooked) food and when it comes to drinks it’s what you will find at a fast food restaurant serving only soda/lemonade in the machines. Everything here is made by hand even there tortillas. Plus there drinks are even hand made as well you can see them squeezing the limes in the back one by one. None of that artificial food coloring or natural flavors. My top choices here are the birria and mole absolutely fire!!< /Text>

The tacos de birria are good. And they serve a plate wth all the fixings, I personaly love that.
But watch out for that reddish salsa! it will set ur ears, mouth n head on fire!
Good prices too.</Text>

Huge fan of their " Child Verde " actually I've been there 6 times and all 6 times I had " Chile Verde "  I asked " without cheese on the beans " 5 of 6 times they came with cheese. I am one who will not return after 2 times of a restaurant getting my order wrong , but is this case... Those beans, rice and Chile Verde too Damn good. 👍👍👍👍👍</review>

< Review>
Best place to go for authentic Mexican Cuisine with an air of Mexico itself.  Specializing in a dish called Birria. (Goat Meat) shreaded in its own favorable sauce. Deliciously served with, just handmade corn tortillas. With Mexican music playing in the background its an atmosphere of "Puro Mexicano" !</Review>

Food is amazing and the new decor is so bright and festive. Food is like I'm eating at home, servers treat you like family once you become a regular, but that doesn't mean you won't get great service. When you eat here... you remember your abuelita<//Text>

<review>I like the Beef birria from here. They have 3 kinds. I just get the dry beef birria (no juice) plate w beans and rice and handmade tortillas, cilantro, lemons, onion, and a cup of caldo/soup.

It was years that i went here...but i wanted some birria.  Anyways, it is very good. Check it out if you are tired of tacos and el pollo loco and wanted something more traditional...go for this.

Traditional Mexican dishes are also offered here. Check it out.< /review><Date>1539151697246< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Service was nice, decoration was fun! They have nachos that aren't on the menu. They were better than average, but the chips were slightly stale and the Chili Verde more on the watery side. 8/10.<//Text>

< review>
I’ve never written a review for any place, but Chris was very sweet and helpful which made me want to leave a review. He was very patient with my boyfriend and I esp since we wanted to get matching shoes. I felt so bad asking him to look for 6 different pairs of shoes, but he made our shopping experience very pleasant. Thank you, Chris!! (: (hopefully I spelled his name right)<//review>

<user_name>Jason Harrold< /user_name><review>Small vans store. Selection of wheels. Hat. Shirts. Of course vans. Went in for a hat today. Pretty standard selection. $28.00 for a vans hat?? Eek.
I felt like the T shirt and hat selection was a bit lacking. Staff could have been friendlier.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaJMzajVHdHNmaT3R_x-6V7hhlLCQERDn0BroU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><user>114861004532389296064< /user><Date>1567284323800< /Date>< Rating>

The young lady was polite, professional and extremely helpful. Informed me about the sale going on and actually helped me find a shoe my style which complemented my style.
Awesome place!</Review>

L really like this store. And I like it even more now that I know I can get Harry Potter shoes for myself and my daughter from here. Keep getting new Harry Potter stuff and you will keep me as a customer.<//review>

<review>Seriously I don't expect much from Fox Hills but from the moment we walked in up to the purchase and walking out, I t was a very pleasant experience. Maybe it was cause it's Tuesday. There were several people in the store though so the fact we one on one was still welcomed with appreciation.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>I’ve been here so many times and it’s always an absolute clusterfûck. They’re never stocked up with even normal sizes. Always super understaffed so it takes at least 5 full minutes to get your size or even flag anyone down. Totally packed to the point that I usually have to just sit on the ground to try shoes on. Last time I bought a pair of shoes, I got home and noticed each shoe was in a different size.

Don’t get me started on Westfield parking. Make sure you give yourself an extra half hour to even find a spot.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< time>

Yesterday (Apr 3, 2018) I called in advance to have the Vans store at Westfield Culver City put on hold 2 pair of shoes for me to pick up when i got off work. First off, I called the store 12 times mid-day (2pm) before I even got someone to answer the phone. I told them what exact shoe and size i wanted and they confirmed they had both pair and said they would be at the counter waiting on me as long as i got them before days end. I got there at 6pm. When I walked in i spotted the 2 boxes tagged with my name on it. I proceeded to the back to ask for 1 more additional shoe and a couple other items. There were at LEAST 5 maybe 6 store associates working and only 2 other customers but the service was sooooo SLOW. I finally got the additional pair which was damaged about 15 mins later! I then asked for them to switch them out another pair and pointed out the damage, the associate said he would and then sent a different associate out 10 mins later with what I assumed was the fresh pair, luckily i looked in the box because it was the same EXACT pair w the defect after the associate had just confirmed he switched them for another pair. I then get to the register, (15 mins later) and the 2 boxes are gone! Oddly enough the teen in front if me just so happens to be buying a pair of the EXACT same color and size i had on hold that have now went missing. Now to top this off, the associate that is at the register doesn't know how to complete the transaction and hes there alone. Another 10 mins go by and the Manager comes from the back (From looking for my order that they KNOW theyre selling to the kid in front of me) saying they cant find my shoes. I said well that's funny because I look directly at them with a post it sticker on them with my name when i walked in and sat my box of goods to exchange on the register. Then she says maybe you called a different store because we don't hold shoes in the front. So i have her confirm the number, and I show her my call log proving I spoke to some one at that location and reiterate I SAW the shoes, that now the girl in front of me mysteriously has a pair same size etc. Then she says well I can give you 10% off the defective shoe (no acknowledgement of the store associate that just out right lied saying he switched them out) Then says well I'm not sure about the shoes you claim to be on hold, we don't have them and my entire crew all just got here at 6 so if you don't know who you spoke with I cant help you....WHAT?!?!!

Smh, worst experience EVER! Especially after spending nearly $300! =(

Almost ruined my daughters Van's themed Birthday.

They can kiss me as a customer GOOD BYE after this experience.< /Text>

My boyfriend and I brought our cars here to be cleaned. He has an Audi Q8 and I have a Fiat 500. They told us that neither of our cars would fit in their system. When we all know this isn’t true. They did the same thing to others in previous reviews, when they had brought the same cars here and they fit then suddenly one day they don’t? It makes no sense. They also have a giant sign saying they accept competitor coupons when they accept nothing. It would have been one thing if they were apologetic about the cars “not fitting” and price gouging for a hand wash, but they were rude and unprofessional. We wash our cars weekly and regret trying this place out. Would never recommend. Go to Beach City’s down the street.<//Text>

Second time there. First my car got back with plenty of detail parts dirty. Now I got the "luxury wash" and they return my car like this. I didn't complain because I am really exhausted by people's incompetence or disregard. I'll finish it by myself. If you want a really superficial clean and are too lazy to do it by yourself, and have 20 dollars to trow away, you can go, if not stay away.</Review>

Attendants adjust prices, inconsistent.
Last week I paid 10.00 for mat cleaning.
They didn’t even clean my mats.
This week I went in and they want to charge me 20.00!
I politely decided to leave and the attended just says ok! And waved bye bye...

Wash is nice, but I work in Santa Monica so I stop here on a Fri to save time. Even though I own a truck. The cost is $10-$12 more than Los Angeles prices. I'm afraid to ask how  much a wax detail cost 😨😱. Bottom line folks in SM are getting their wallets ripped off 💸 💸🤑 😢.</text>

<review>This place has really gone downhill. My third of three bad experiences with a wash here in the last few months. Refuse to do the actual work to fix it and claim you just didn’t pay enough, despite it clearly stating they will vacuum the interior of the car and wipe it down. Car was just detailed 1.5 weeks prior, and was not that dirty coming in except for typical kid stuff. The management is extremely rude and unfriendly from the time you pull in to the wash.</review>< Pictures>

Stay away! High prices,  5 minute sloppy wash and horrible customer service. They were caught over charging me on top of the already high prices and then the manager became angry and defensive saying he "doesn't care". Now I know why this place is never busy when I drive by. Others have decided to stay away also.<//Review>

There were some little spots that they missed but I got the cheapest package ($18 at the time of review) so I can't really complain. Overall it was as expected. For a more thorough wash I'd go somewhere more expensive.< /text>

Do not go here. They don’t care about quality. Paid $22 for a car wash and waited 20 minutes. They didn’t vacuum the trunk, didn’t clean the middle console, back windows left with streaks - and absolutely no customer service.</review>

PLEASE LISTEN TO EVERYONE THAT GAVE THIS CAR WASH 1 STAR!. I am not confrontational.  I'm one of those extreme introverts, so it's hard for me to speak my mind. My white Camry was very dirty due to this uncanny LA weather  . I couldn't take it any more and was passing by so I stopped.  $30.00 for THE WORST car wash ever. They apparently have a quota(watch how quick they dry and wipe down) . Bird poop, dirt and water was running and dripping from my car.  When I asked for him to PLEASE wipe, he appeared to have an attitude.  Mind you, it was pretty busy and it ONLY took 20 minutes.  Shows you how much time they spend on the cars. I am thoroughly disgusted and will never return. (Btw, I stood there using the water from my car to wipe it down. No one even offered help.  I didn't  even bothered to inform the manager, felt it wouldn't do any good.< /text>

I love this car wash it is so fast and the price is very fair. Even the most basic car wash will live your car clean and ready to roll. I'm usually in a rush to get to work but this place is speedy. Free vacuum available after your car wash which can extend to reach every part of your car. I've been here twice already and this is definitely my go to.<//text>

I paid for the #1 superwash which come with interior and exterior cleaning and extras (look at the menu for extras) but when I got my car I had spots all over the outside, undercarriage was still dirty too, dusty inside, even my windows still had spots and specks. must not care about other customers when there rent and profit  is covered from the guarenteed buisness they get from the city contract to clean city vehicles and police vehicles.😞 really disappointed because I used to work for the city and would take the fleet of vehicles here to get washed. So I thought it would be a good idea to bring my personal vehicle here...wrong !🙁😕😬<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

If I could give them 0 stars I would.  I had just returned from driving a road trip I do often, so obviously the car was dirty.  When I pulled up, the attendant asked what I wanted and I said a basic wash.  As he was about to write the ticket I informed him I had a coupon.  He then looked at me and said "this car is too dirty yo wash, it will be a minimum of $50".  I really thought he was kidding....  a car too dirty to wash?  What does that even mean?  These guys are scammers with their coupons.  If you have one post what excuse they give you to not honor it.  This car wash is awful!<//review>

They do a really good job here, despite breaking the clutch in my Volkswagen a long time ago. I always held that against them, but I guess it wasn't necessarily their fault. I was just mad at the time that they denied it. This was in the 90s. It's a different place now, well not really. And they are a bit expensive. I suppose I can wash my own car and it would be a lot< /Text>

Before the car wash I didn't have a dent in my door. After the car wash I did have a dent in my door. The manager claimed it was impossible that it happened there, but it wasn't there before the car wash and was there after the car wash. Refused to give me my money back, only offered a free wash next time, which I refused because why would I go back to a place that damaged my car.</Text>

<text>The car never comes back entirely clean. They give the car a once over wipe. Whatever is cleaned off is cleaned off and whatever remains is left.

Also never pay full price. The guy always offers deals. You can negotiate and are never sure just how much you are overpaying.

Compared to other carwash places, they at least don't leave towel lint all over the car.< /text>< Pics>

<text>I love that you can stay in your car while it gets washed :) yes I'm lazy. I just hate you have to do the vacuuming and cleansing inside yourself but they make it fast and easy by providing a stall that has vacuums on each side they also have machines that have what you need to properly clean just bring your quarters and they have no ATM.<//text><name>Ernestine Torres<//name><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

UPDATE: I will not be going back to this place ever‼️‼️ I went in to get my 2018 Challenger hand washed today (8/7/19) and they did a horrible, horrible $70 job. They left water spots on my black matte paint and waxes over it. Now I am not sure if my paint is ruined now. Will have to wait until the wax fades after many washes. I hope not. I knew I should have just washed my own damn car‼️‼️ 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
#lostone

Went in for a wax and the did an excellent job. Cleaned the interior and exterior. Very happy with the service. Will be going back.</text>

Tried this place for the first time. I was happy with the wash but not sure why they charge $25.  I can get the same work done for $15 other places.  I'll try then again though and see if it was just an off day.<//Text>

I've brought my car here twice in the last four months for the $59.99 wash/wax/wheels + interior cleaning package. Service was friendly, and the job was done well and completed in a timely fashion.

And you can buy a snack or drink and hang in the outdoor waiting area.

It's becoming my go-to car wash.</Review>

<Text>Reasonable price and fair cleaning. I can’t say they did a perfect job, but at the same time I took their basic in and out cleaning. The outside was very clean, the inside was just OK. But for the price they charge it is good enough for me to come back here.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I need a new car wash place.  I have put up with Bonus Car Wash (on Lincoln) rude up-selling practices, BUT now I am not returning.  I paid extra to have the inside of the car cleaned....they did a poor job, but I decided to let it go...UNTIL I looked in the back of the car...where the plastic areas had NOT been touched at all.  Drove there to show them the problem..and  what i got was "come back on Thursday when the manager is in". I asked if I could get a card, so I could call and was told to look it up on the internet! Not the place to go if you want customer service.</text><user>102647434520297834535< /user>< rate>

I brought the car in for specific issue that needed to be cleaned driver door, radio, inside windshield and other places. It is convertible and the top was down. When they gave me the car...none of what needed to be cleaned was done. They fought with me and said because of the issue it would cost an additional $100. When I got home and put the top up...they had not cleaned it or the back window. The manager was rude about it. They also kept speaking in Spanish when not speaking to me.<//review>

<Text>The guys who initially took the car and did the vacuuming were all very pleasant but it wasn't a fabulous wash. It was an OK car wash. Pro: 😀 it didn't take very long.   They say they take all competitors coupons but when I tried to use one there was some confusion about it. I did point out that the sign said all competitors coupons. The young lady was very nice and did apologize and rectify the mistake.  I would come here again if I were in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.</Text>< pictures>

I've given this place multiple chances as it's right across the street from my house and super convenient, but I definitely won't be going back after this last time. I'm nearly positive they just upsell people on things (tire shine, sealer, etc) but don't actually relay the information to the people that are finishing the job, so the products you purchase don't actually get applied. I requested that they remove some residue from a sticker that was on my windshield and was told it was "no problem". I also was upsold tire shine. Neither of these things were completed when I got my car back. I've also been super disappointed with the quality of the clean on more than one occasion. Dirt that clearly should have been wiped up/vacuumed up. Just not very thorough. Definitely not worth the money.< /Text>

<Review>My experience at this place has been ok.  Better than some car washes, but by no means the best.  The best thing they have going for them is that the employees are unionized, so presumably getting fair wages.  What I don't like: the up-sell pitch they give you.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Came in today with a big problem, when an approximately 10 inch wide splotch of fresh sap landed on my hood while parked at the nearby Sunday Farmer's Market. The gentlemen in the check-in line took the time to carefully remove the sap and buff out the hood, with no residual damage visible. The wash itself was no better or worse than anyone else's wash, but I'm giving them give stars for their emergency service!< /text>

They take a long time
Almost a 1/2 hour
But the best car wash in town
Since they closed Wilshire / 25th
Nice selection of greeting cards in their gift shop
Excellent coffee
Anyone in a wheelchair would be very comfortable here, they seem to have gone to great lengths to make it fully accessible
Also, sparkly clean
I like that they offer gas too</text>

If you want get your new car damaged by Bonus Car wash and pay for the damage yourself -Bonus Car wash is the place to go. Took my new BMW for wash they broke my reflector.  Had to wait for 10 days and drive around with missing part.  Today I found myself in the area and my car was very dusty so I went back to give this place another chance.  Secured my reflectors with the tape to prevent from breaking.  Manager Rafael, started yelling at me that if they break any parts of may car or damage it I will pay out of my pocket.  He clearly told me never come back.  Good luck with your business of yelling at your clients and breaking their new cars, Rafael!< /Review>

<name>Yuri Baranov< /name><Review>I was driving by and wanted to give it a try. I have a Tesla and the front guy told me that it can't be a regular wash, it has to be an outside hand wash. I'm experienced with car washes, a friend of mine owned a few of those and I know for a fact that a machine wash is just as good - no difference in terms of scratching, etc. I asked him why and without blushing or blinking an eye, he immediately answered that the tunnel is too low for a Tesla.

I have no problem to pay $25 vs $14 as you can tell but I hate being lied to in the most blatant manner. I just got back into my car and left for the other car wash on Lincoln (Millenium). Don't do business with scammers. It's a matter of pride and justice. Never going back.<//Review><response>None<//response></record>

The service here was good but not great. There was still a lot lot of sand on the back seats that was not vacuumed up. The exterior wash was very brief and a few spots needed to be wiped off.< /Review>

Mediocre wash. Pointed out a discoloration from bird $h!t in my paint and the first guy said “nothing can be done” while the manager refused to address it as well. Go here if you want a mediocre and slightly overpriced car wash.

Update: got home and it took me literally 10 seconds with some rubbing compound to fix the paint. What a joke. Never again. Unhelpful, lousy service. Go elsewhere.<//text>

DONT GO TO THIS PLACE

The worst place for washing car. When I went the guy told me no problem you can wash your car but if it's raining come back on Friday for free wash and if you forget your receipt bring the yellow stamp. So I came back friday with my stamp and an other guy told me that I have to bring my receipt so I went to my home took my stuff and when I came to the car wash the guy told me sorry we can't wash your car !!!!

<gmapID>0x80c2bada1afd6555:0x3e3636f019ea599d< /gmapID><text>I live 2 blocks away from this place & just cant go here anymore. The place is run totally sketchy. They talked me into buying a booklet of prepaid basic car washes & the benefit was you get 1 free car wash (the 11th)  which equates to a little over 10% off for them. Every time I use one and I don't upgrade the basic wash they actually warn me that the basic wash isn't that good. Before I bought the booklet the basic was fine but when you redeem the coupons they do a very noticeably bad job like today they put the garbage back in my car instead of throwing it away!!!! It was just a couple paper bags & a dry cleaning plastic bag both on the floor balled up, but still. AND I was second in line and they let me car sit for almost 20 minutes!! & pulled 7 cars that came in after me thru and waited till there were No More cars before they even started vaccuuming my car. Totally scam place,  really low grade job and there are 2 other cars washes with in a half mile in both directions -
Lincoln Car Wash
1624 Lincoln Blvd
Santa Monica, CA 90404
&
Bonus Car Wash
2800 Lincoln Blvd
Santa Monica, CA 90405

Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this ghetto low grade bad service lazy place!!</text></record>

<Text>The park was okay little Dusty I suppose it's because under the trees and the grass doesn't grow. A little crowded people were blocking me in in my parking space. But there was no ruckus, everything was everything all praises to God.</Text>< Response>

< Review>
Reason we went to the park for my 12 yr old son's club soccer friendly game.

The good......the field is in good shape, is synthetic turf. The bad.........the area is a disaster and looks like a war zone. Parking extremely difficult. People double parked, Parked in red zones. Parked on the side walk. Homeless and trash everywhere. Pure lawlessness!! People smoke in the park both cigarettes and marijuana. The restroom in the park had urine and fececes on the floors and WALLS!! Beer cans and caps on the ground throughout the whole park. People in the park and the area were friendly. With the exception of the homeless / vagrants. Who are unfortunately dealing with mental health issues and/or substance issues. Seen aggresive, violent and antisocial behavior from then in the area. Last, do not leave anything that look of value in your car when parked. But that goes for everywhere, I guess.</Review>

Nice little playground, the swings are always occupied though. Usually come here to have a snack. There's also a free campsite by the basketball courts, it smells a little funky but quiet enough to spend the night.</Text>

<Review>I love this park.. I grew up in this neighborhood, 41st PL and Avalon. Back in the 70s trought the early 2000s, it was hell, you couldn't go to the park and play because all of a sudden there would be gang related shootings. I am proud to say that it is now peaceful and there isn't as many incidents as there used to be.... I will always keep coming back to this neighborhood that saw me grew up.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>SAD TOO SAY THERE'S "NO HANDICAP PARKING" ITS BEEN LIKE THIS FOR A WHILE NOW , LIGHT BULBS NEED TO GET FIX REALLY DARK AND IM TALKING ALL AROUND THE PARK FROM 42ND TO SAN PEDRO TO 41ST TO AVALON.. THEY NEED TOO PUT UP SOME KIND OF NET BEHIND THE GOALIE ON THE BIG FIELD TOO MANY BALLS GOING OVER AND PEOPLE GETTING HIT WITH SOCCER BALL ESPECIALLY IF YOUR IN THE EXERCISE AREA..

"THIS PARK IS A LAND MARK ITS  THE ORIGINAL LOS ANGELES ANGELS BASEBALL  STADIUM"

BUT AGAIN THERES NOTHING THAT TELLS THE COMMUNITY THE HISTORY OF IT ANOTHER THING WHY? DOESN'T THIS PARK HAVE A BASKETBALL GYM LIKE EVERYONE ELSE... ALSO, PARK DIRECTOR NEEDS TOO GET MORE INVOLVED AND PUSH BASEBALL/SOFTBALL/FLAG FOOTBALL/ETC....<//text>< pics>

Park itself has a lot to offer. However, there seems to be a lot of activity, so one should always just take extra precaution measures. I also didn't notice if there was an onsite sherrif or security, which many parks today serm to offer.</text>

This is a big public park where it has parking spaces and it has a few different free fields that you can play out on . They have 4 soccer fields,  4 basket ball courts,  they have a skate park and they have a playground that is like 200 feet square yard and they also have the park together so you can go back and forth and back to any of the parks<//Text>

<time>1607394170042</time><rate>2<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) I liked it because it has games for small children of 6 years, which I did not like, I was wearing my mask well on, my granddaughter, but the other people, there were many young people, too many young people playing skateboards and the adults also did not wear a mask. I liked it because they don't wear a mask there is no distancing and they don't promote wearing the mask there is a lot of disease for us to wear a mask they have to be

<Review>(Translated by Google) The park is very beautiful but it is no longer suitable for children there, what is a drug shelter, it is horrible to spend there and the smoke does not let you breathe.
