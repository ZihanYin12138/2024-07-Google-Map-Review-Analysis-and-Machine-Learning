<review>We had a great experience here working with Janelle. We were looking for a couple of mattresses but not sure of all the options. We found the store had a lot of nice mattresses across a wide price range. Janelle discussed the various manufacturers and styles with us, and then let us alone to try them out. We got a new "hybrid" mattress (gel top over springs) and will get the second one once we sleep on this one for a while to see how much we like it (so far we like it a lot.) In any case, I'd recommend the Placerville Mattress Firm store and Janelle. As a side note, I had previously been to the Folsom store, and both had all the same models we were interested in.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Definitely the place to go for a great mattress. I personally worked with Madison who was awesome at asking the right questions to find the perfect bed for my spouse and I, since he and I have different tastes in mattress firmness. We both love it now thanks to her :) referring all my friends to this location.< /Review>< pictures>

Janelle was incredibly knowledgeable about the mattress brands in the Placerville store and stuck with us through many many questions. She was friendly and patient.  In the end she got us a better deal than we could have hoped for, I highly encourage you to stop and work with Janelle if you are interested in seeing what new technology is out there now.<//Text>

She was enthusiastic in her attentiveness and quick to find the solotions needed to take care of my needs. She found an amazing deal on a mattress originally priced at 7k for me for only 2.5k! I dreamed about owning this bed but never expected to pay less than 3.5k even for a used one. She walked thru the ordering & shipping process with me really thoroughly and I walked away with a bed months before I expected Id be able to afford one. Glad my friend recommended me to mattress firm and SO glad a Placerville brach opened up!< /review></record>

She was very knowledgeable in the products and services they provide. Because of this she was able to  give me several bed options that would suit my needs and helped me settle on one that best fit my price range. The best part was she was not a pushy salesmen at all and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire experience!< /Review>

<review>Janelle was incredibly knowledgeable about the mattress brands in the Placerville store and stuck with us through many many questions. She was friendly and patient.  In the end she got us a better deal than we could have hoped for, I highly encourage you to stop and work with Janelle if you are interested in seeing what new technology is out there now.<//review>< resp>

< Review>
Madison was the besssst! She was enthusiastic in her attentiveness and quick to find the solotions needed to take care of my needs. She found an amazing deal on a mattress originally priced at 7k for me for only 2.5k! I dreamed about owning this bed but never expected to pay less than 3.5k even for a used one. She walked thru the ordering & shipping process with me really thoroughly and I walked away with a bed months before I expected Id be able to afford one. Glad my friend recommended me to mattress firm and SO glad a Placerville brach opened up!<//Review>

<review>They made a 2-tiered wedding cake on short notice for me for a friend's wedding and did a wonderful job. Cake was visually perfect, just like we asked, and really good frosting and cake. Overall very happy and the red velvet cake was the best red velvet I have ever had. Thank you so much!</review>< Resp>

Cupcakes look amazing. Taste isn't the best. I didn't even finish mine because it wasn't worth the calories. Super dry and stale tasting. I had two different ones and they were both not great. I had chocolate pudding, the chocolate pudding inside made it taste raw. I also had smores, the marshmellow whipped cream was ok. They taste like they are vegan or gluten-free, if you don't choose to eat this way then your food shouldn't taste like it is. Mediocre at best.</Text>

They have some gluten free ones too.
We were really happy with the chocolate peanut butter, tiramisu, s'mores, and cookies & cream. We'll definitely stop by the next time we're around. The cupcakes are refrigerated & they tell you as much. Friendly staff.

<text>I initially wanted to get cupcakes here because someone brought in a dozen to my work and they tasted delicious. These cupcakes are moist and have great and unique flavors. The reason why I'm only giving 3 stars is because the price. If you are on a budget, really consider your choice on buying from here. But if budget isn't an issue by all means go here! Great cupcakes, just pricy.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Small, overpriced, and stale cupcakes. All my mom wanted for her birthday was a decent vanilla cupcake, she said it was the worst she ever had. The pictures on the website made them look deceptively bigger or I would have never spent 20 bucks on five tiny cupcakes. The lemon coconut was good but still too small to give a good review.< /review><GmapID>0x80d955ea715fbc1d:0xb0a02731f7833bed</GmapID>< Time>

I've heard so much about this place, but it was not as great as expected.  I had the red velvet cheesecake which the employee recommended over the cupcake. It was decent i guess. I guess i should of stuck to plain red velvet cupcake. I also tried the banana pudding which was good but not amazing as everyone says.... eh 3 stars. SO hard to find parking and a bit pricey!< /text>

<review>Very good cupcakes. Only held back a star due to the frosting not being my 5 star favorite on some of the cupcakes. The actual cake part is excellent.
They have really great flavors- Oreo being a great one and the Smores is also really yummy.

Love the local success!</review>< pictures>

They sell gluten free cupcakes. My favorite is the strawberry shortcake cupcake and the gluten free version tasted so good. It was moist inside and the frosting was just light and not too sweet. Most of their cupcakes are not too sweet which is what I prefer.<//text>

Most cupcake places make good baked that have the flavor of the titled cupcake but the sugar and sweetness often overrides with too much richness. Yola's cupcakes taste exactly like the names of the flavor. For example, the strawberry shortcake has the exact taste and texture of strawberry shortcake. The others are the same. So delicious, not to rich and not too sweet!< /Text>

Chocolate Raspberry was dry and didn't even taste much of raspberry, icing was weirdly too thick. Strawberry shortcake, dry as well. The icing was better on this one, but the cake itself was baked uneven, dry and had no flavor. Very plain. Wouldn't go back or reccomrre. Nothing horribly wrong, just not worth the price for what you get.<//Review>< user_id>

< Review>
I originally was really disappointed with these cupcakes because they seemed extremely dense and just not up to par with gourmet cupcakes. Let them sit out for a while. My cupcakes were extremely cold and once they got more room temp the frosting and cake itself became lighter and more balanced. Glad I tried them again later because otherwise I would have been very upset</Review>

I had been craving some cupcakes and found this place online. I wasn't sure what to expect but it ended up being a great find. The cupcakes were so yummy. The frosting is so light and sweetened just enough. I'd come back here again and again for cupcakes.< /Review>

Simple but amazing. Best tiramisu I've had, in a cupcake! Classic strawberry shortcake was great. I hate pumpkin but even the pumpkin maple was soo good. I'm visiting from Portland but wish I were a local for these cupcakes<//review>

<Review>I think the cupcakes here are good but nothing spectacular. He seemed a little pricey to me for what you got. It's nice to have a place like this in this area but I would look out for some discounts or coupons if they ever run them.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Shame on you YOLA.  You committed to donating a gift certificate for our fundraiser.  I purchased your expensive pastries to show my appreciation & when I called to confirm the pick up, you say sorry.  Your a DISHONEST person who will never get my business again.

In all honesty, the raspberry cupcake was dry and creme brulee was okay.  The toppng was mushy and I enjoy a bit of crunch. I guess it's okay we didn't get your donation.</Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1539121411095, 'text': 'Dear Monica,\nI’m very saddened that you chose to shame us in this fashion. As a small business, we are approached by several fund raising coordinators weekly. We do our best to support our local schools and charities and initiatives that are close to our heart. But in the end, we are not able to accommodate every single one. When you first contacted us, I said: “let me see what I can do” but due to several other donations this month, I had to say “no” to you today. And never have we received such a hateful reaction from someone who’s request we had to deny, because if not this time, maybe next time we can help. I’m shocked and hurt by your reaction. That’s not what charity is about.\nObviously there is never any requirement to purchase anything from us in exchange for donations. Again, that’s not how charity works. Please consider the impact of your words and actions before you damage another small business.'}< /Resp></record>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>I've had gourmet cupckes in Va, Ma, Ct & NJ....and these were not gourmet. They do have great frosting, it was light, fluffy, not to thick on top. But the cake was dry, looked like it wasnt mixed well & baked uneven. Also for $3.25 a cupcake it was a small cupcake. Anytime I've paid over $3 it was big.
I may give them another try but Im still looking for my cupcake spot.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Love dive family restaurants - the food was great and it was super cheap. Two tacos, rice and beans and a beer for less than a single entree at most places. Friendly service and you're helping a family make it when you eat there. Win, win, win...</Review>

First time trying this place. My husband really wanted pesole and they serve this on weekends. I wanted enchiladas. Neither of us was disappointed. His was spicy and full of flavor, they were kind enough to put the toppings in a separate container, so when he came home he was able to put it together just how he likes it. My enchiladas were full of chopped delicious beef. The beans and rice were perfect. Recommend.<//Review>

Was looking for a new place to try. I called another place, they didn't answer their phone, so I tried Tacos Tijuana. I am so glad that I did. The food was fantastic. Wife had the Chili Relleno and her first words were, "this is a do again". She also raved about the refried beans. I had the taquitos and tacos. All were delicious. This is now our go too place. We found  great place to eat because someone else didn't bother to answer their phone.</review>

Excellent mexican food! I highly recommend it. I'm picky when it comes to mexican food after living in Mexico for some time. This makes my list and very few have! I enjoyed the chicken tamales. Their burritos were very good as well as the chips and guac. Nice staff, fast service.<//review>

Customer service was fine, as all the staff were friendly, and were quick to table.

Food came out quickly, about 6 - 8 minute wait.

I ordered #35 a received a pretty plate of beans, rice, guacamole, chunky salsa, and shrimp glazed in butter and garlic with a red tinted sauce. The beans and rice were alright, but not warm, but also not overly salted like some other restaurants can sometimes push out.

The shrimp had their tails unfortunately and were only just warm, but that's not to distract from the that was sauce on the shrimp.

It was sweet, just hot enough, spiced well, and was definitely the strongest part of the meal.

Overall, it would be 7.3 out of 10, and I enjoyed the food.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>I just bought a super burrito from them and it looks like a regular sized burrito that I can get from another place for the same price. So in my opinion it’s not a super burrito it’s a regular burrito. That’s the first thing I noticed before trying it to find out how much flavor it had. I took a few bites and then it got spicy. I don’t mind a little spice but wow that burned the roof of my mouth. Not sure what kind of chili sauce they used but I couldn’t finish more than half of it. Other than those 2 things I can say it was good flavor just a little bit too much spice for me. I wouldn’t go back there but it was still good to try it out.< /review>< pictures>

Really small burritos. Also the  large nachos are not large at all. At over $10 too 😬
Bland. Any other taco truck in oroville is way better than this place.</text>

I had ordered a chicken cassadella a beef taco a chicken taco and the shrimp that was grilled in a garlicky butter. Was delicious.  The only negative that might be is they show verde red sauce.

< review>
HORRIBLE customer service. I purchased two shields at $80 a piece with a 2-year plan which includes 2 free replacement shields. I have 3 shields left and tried to get my sons replaced. They told me they couldn’t because his phone is too old and I needed to upgrade and still would have to purchase a new shield if I did that. This store will rip you off. Do not purchase anything from them. Go to a REAL Verizon store. The manager hasn’t called me back and it’s been a over a week.</review>

<Review>STEVEN (LONG HAIR, RED BEARD) really took care of us! He went above and beyond with exceptional customer service when my girlfriend and I came in to do two upgrades on our plan to the IPhone 11 Pro Max.. Typically we DO NOT like upgrading because of how long it takes and the fact that we usually lose most of our pictures or whatever when we do the swap to new phones. STEVEN made the process quick, painless and all while juggling other people (Including one crazy customer talking about aliens hacking her information lol). I highly recommend asking for STEVEN, he is very knowledgeable and just overall a really easy going and professional guy. That guy deserves every part of this shout out! Thanks again man!<//Review>< Resp>

<review>The worst customer service! Stepped inside stood there over twenty minutes and they didn't even acknowledge that I was there! Mind you there were only three other customers inside at the time. A great way to treat their customers!< /review>< pics>

<review>The Red Bearded Man is magical! Hahaha thank you Steven for helping me when no other store would. Had many issues with my phone, and he took his time showing me what went wrong and possible options. Ended up keeping my current phone, but I will be back to  buy one here.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I went in to simply purchase a charger for my iPhone - and the sales person said they don’t accept cash (after walking back to my car to get exact change because first he told me they don’t have change to give me - like any dollars or coins!!!) so they lost a sale at a time where they should be chomping to earn revenue. BAD BUSINESS. This is the only business I’ve been in completely refusing cash. My money is as dirty as that card your swiping or the key pad you expect me to touch. Either way that’s Ludacris

Won’t come back to any Verizon again.< /Review>

Let me start by saying I normally don't write a review unless the service was exceptional or horrible. I've had issues with my phone, I've call Verizon I've been on hold for a long time, I've been to other facilities and I have to say by far at this is the best location I've gone to. Steven was very patient and knowledgeable specially when it came to my Samsung phone. If I ever get a new phone or accessories I will definitely go back to him. Thank you Steven!!!</text>

I consider it my office and therefore the most important investment I have. There's not enough room to write about this place and their manager Steven. I drove all the way here from Glendora after getting the worst service at the Verizon store in Glendora. I had a problem transferring my data from my 8+ to my new iPhone 11. I made an appointment for the Verizon store only to have them tell me that they were ordered to shut down (for not following the rules of course) and couldn't help me. Their customer Service was the worst. I frantically started checking Google for the nearest Verizon and found this place, GoWireless. I realized it was further than what I wanted but made a phone call and spoke to Steven who said there are several ways that he can help me and to just come on down. So glad I did. Today is day two he's been working on this and he never gave up on me after realizing that it was practically impossible to do a simple transfer of data. There was one final method that he could try (because he's smart and WANTS to help) to get my data transferred. So I'm sitting here at GoWireless and it is almost done. I am hoping the regional managers and owner of GoWireless is reading this. THIS MAN IS AN ASSET. Employees like him are very very hard to come by.  GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE! No really. Take care of him before someone sweeps in and steals him from you. THANK YOU Steven. I don't know what I would've done without you.< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>Steven is the manager at this store. The customer service here is amazing!! He personally took care of 3 billings issues with customer service as he helped another 2 customers. He has a new customer for life. Saved me $100 on my bill.</Text>< rating>

Best customer service I’ve ever had in my life. Thank you Steven for going beyond what was expect to bless me with this trip to Verizon. I cannot be more appreciative of your excellent attention to detail and willingness to help me. Steven I hope you read this because you seriously rock and deserve a raise.</Text>

<text>I find the staff to very courteous and professional. I have done business with the store for a number of years. I always return anytime I am in need of Verizon services. The manager impressed on my first contact some years ago. I was happy today to see that he was still there. I regret not being able to recall his name at this time. He is short, pleasant and Ernest. Appears to be of Asian descent. I am embarrassed that I cannot call his name at this time, but I think he deserves credit for maintaining a relaxed, productive work environment.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Having been a longtime customer of Go Wireless, i had a dead phone and tried to get it replaced by the Corporate Verizon store over Thanksgiving weekend. I would have had to be without a phone for 5 days. I wasn't comfortable with their solution and came  to Go Wireless. I had the absolute best experience at this store.  Chris, the Manager listened to me and accommodated my requests. It was such a great experience i came back to get a second new phone.<//text><time>1544123812079</time><Gmap_id>0x80c336d5de2b2251:0x6f3f413019e8a6f6</Gmap_id>< Response>

I went in to pick up a phone that was pre-ordered and had been paid for. As I walk in, I was never greeted at any time. The rep actually sighed because it was 7:55 and they closed at 8. As I sat down he asked “what was I there for”. I simply told him that I ordered a phone and was picking it up. He said “look man are you trying to get a line or do you have it”. I said “it was a new line that was opened up, I’m just picking up the phone”. He said well are you paying cash or card. I repeated twice saying“ it’s paid for but I’ll pay cash if anything is left”. He clearly wasn’t listening because he was concentrating on closing. He stopped and said “well we can’t take cash because I counted the register and we only take card”. He never asked me for my number or ever checked my order number. I just switched and I’m planning on going back. I also do sales and this was the most lazy unprofessional employee I have ever met. This encounter was very unprofessional from the moment I walk in to the moment I leave. Not even a “thank you for coming”. Never going back to this store. Don’t go to a retailer store! They aren’t the real thing, look for a corporate store! They will also lie saying they have better deals than a corporate store but they don’t!< /text>

Horrible service. Tried to return a phone within my 14 days (online at go wireless it says 180) because of a price drop in the phone. the next day they told me that I could return it but I need to get the $300.00 I put down on the phone from their corporate office. Over the next 4 months of dealing with corporate and going through their claims department, I was told that I would have to get my money back from the store themselves. I have called them several times and when I got through I talked to Chris the manager. He told me that he would personally look into it and call me back in 20 minutes. 1 hour passes, so I call back and he tells me that he's working on it and that it's his number one priority a week later still no call and still trying to get my money back. This is nothing short of stealing. If you want a phone there is no reason to go to this store you can literally go across the street to a real Verizon store for better service. I can't believe that that Verizon even sponsors go wireless. DO NOT GO HERE, GO ACROSS THE STREET.</review>

<Text>This store is the only reason we stay with Verizon.  Unlike most Verizon stores.....if you have a problem with your phone, they take care of it immediately.  You can really tell a lot about a business by how they handle problems, and other stores should really learn a lesson from them.  Selection and pricing is the same as other Verizon stores, but the service is what really makes this place great.  They go out of their way to help you and make sure you are happy.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This store is Awesome! I have been a customer for years, along with all my brothers business account and will never go any where else. Chris the manager and all of the staff treat you with respect and curtesy whether you are looking for a new phone or just a charger for your mom. Thanks to them I have been a Verizon customer for ever.<//Text>

My wife purchased an iPhone from Candace and was not satisfied with the purchase. Gave a trade in 64gb iPhone 6 Plus assuming that it was going to be credited towards the total but wasn't. My wife was given a bag with her phones and some electronics which she thought were promotional items. I reviewed her receipt and read that her trade in value went towards electronics that she did not want. My wife was not able to return those items because the value of trade in phones could only be used for in store purchases. Bad communication will not shop at an authorized dealer again.< /text>

<text>I've been going to this store for years and I couldn't be happier with my experience. I started off going to the location across the street on 19th but was finally fed up with the horrible customer service, never have I been treated so bad as I did at that 19th st location. I went across the street to the location next to Wells Fargo and Chick-Fil-A and haven't gone anywhere else since. Great prices, wonderful customer service! I'd recommend anyone to that store! Its a must go!< /text>< time>

There are barely any working displays. All of the smart phones have a screen shot picture but you can't actually use them to decide if you like them. I can't say much about the service cause I wasn't in there long enough to find out.</text>

Awesome and really well themed! This place is a quality escape room, with high quality props, decor, and puzzles. We had a great time and would definitely return. The staff was super friendly too and they had appropriate and reasonable COVID protocols. We will definitely come back for another room next time we are in town.< /review>

My wife and I have been to multiple escape rooms in different parts of the country and this is by far the best one! The staff was amazing and very friendly. We did the Uncle Tick Tock's Circus room which was interactive and decorated very well. They give unlimited hints however, you must complete the room with three hints or less in order to qualify for the fastest time recognition wall. Overall great experience and would most definitely recommend!</Text>

My favorite escape room experience yet! The ambiance and theme was thrilling. Heather, our host, was extremely patient with our group as well as helpful and friendly. She stayed in character the entire time, making the experience more memorable and exciting. So glad you guys reopened post Covid quarantine ❤️<//Review>

It was a BLAST! I had no idea how much fun this would be and was really neat to try something off the beaten path of Napa's "wine scene." The staff at the Grape Escape are excellent, funny, and helpful (thanks Heather!) We laughed,  solved puzzles, made blunders, but ultimately got out just in the nick of time. I highly recommend this experience to anyone of any age!</Review>< Pics>

We’d still be there otherwise. Lol! After some time went on I/we started attaching on to looking for certain patterns and how to find the clues. We had a great time!!! (They are also putting in a bar. Just saying) I don’t know what the harder rooms are like, but I imagine they are awesome for you pros out there!! Side note: if you have a fear of clowns, or are claustrophobic, do NOT do this room.

Went here for my girlfriend's birthday celebration in the zombie virus room. I was the clown donning the clown hat every step of the way. I love zombies more than any of you will ever know. And could even comprehend if you tried. And this room definitely delivered. I one hundred percent approve of the experience they gave to us.

The whole place has an amazing atmosphere from the second you walk in. It was my own personal spooky heaven. Each escape room is decorated incredibly well complete with its own sound effects, lighting, artistic detail, et cetera. VERY beautiful and creative!!! The staff were extremely nice and helpful and even helped us figure out what we did wrong when we failed the room due to my expertise in turning on the power properly.  I want to come back as soon as possible... truly an awesome experience, to the full extent of that word.</text>

The amount of puzzles and interactive devices to escape required a ton of teamwork and smarts. I highly recommend this experience.  Great job to the owners and staff.. Thank you.< /review>

<Text>Before this amazing experience, I had never done an escape room before. I've always loved puzzles, I've had a thirst for challenge, and this was a fun way to quench it. Their themes and backstories are incredibly inventive, and while the room I did wasn't too difficult, it's cohesiveness and environment were absolutely enthralling. If you've never done an escape room before, this is the place to start.
Shoutout to all the workers who were super friendly and guiding! (Especially Makali and Marjory! They not only introduced me to The Grape Escape, they also gave me a wonderful and enjoyable experience.)< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><userid>111185730385420990386<//userid><Name>Angelito Guevarra<//Name><Rating>5< /Rating><date>1583567284808<//date>< gmap_id>

<text>Love Love Love! We came here for my boyfriend's mom's birthday and they went above and beyond to celebrate the occasion - embarrassing slideshow and all!

The riddles were well made and engaging. We barely escaped!

What to expect:
- Arrive early by 15 mins to check in and sign waivers
- there is a lounge area when you first enter (this is the time to go to the bathroom)
- from there you're moved to another waiting room where there is a screen with instructions and the rules are explained by your guide
- then you're ushered to the lockers where you can put away your stuff and dress up!
- finally you are locked into your room and the time starts! (Okay, not really locked in; you can leave to go to the bathroom, but it's discouraged so go ahead of time)

We had a blast and the family who runs this place are just the sweetest. If we visit Napa again, we will definitely go again!</text>< rating>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>LOVE this place.

Really tasty and humongously sized salads, super tasty though not incredibly healthy sandwiches, and beer and wine to boot. Try the spicy tuna salad, you won't be disappointed.

The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the price. At $16 a salad, it's just not the kind of thing you can do every day.

Local tip: call ahead to place your order!< /Review>< user_name>

Nice high end sandwich and salad place. Sustainable, organic ingredients. Very yummy. A little pricey but not outrageous. I had their spicy tuna salad ($15) and it was delicious.< /text>

<Text>Love this place, it's a great counter-balance to the other not-so-healthy restaurant options in this area.  The ingredients are fresh and taste great, the salad combinations are very well thought out, and if all else fails you can just create your own and pick whatever ingredients you want.  I've yet to try a sandwich here, but by look, smell, and fellow customer reaction, they're equally delicious.

Prepare to wait in a long line if you come here at any "normal" time/day.  Otherwise, Blue Barn is great!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Amazing burger and loved the spicy curly fries. Great selection of gourmet burgers that are quite large and very filling.

I had the hickory one and it tastes like a delicious bbq in my mouth. Fries were cooked well, just enough seasonings (not actually spicy) and went well with the ranch dipping sauce.

Service was good, attentive staff that were available but not annoying. Will be coming back again.<//Text>< username>

Favorites include fattoush, detox, and the spring, topped with perfectly tender steak to balance things out. Be prepared to wait, better yet take it to go and enjoy on Crissy field. Enjoy your salad munchers!< /text>< Pics>

Wee bit pricy but when you want to top off a good day and make it great. ..bring napkins and prepare to drool a lot!

Wish there was a combo deal.
The curly fries looked good.
And I love sweet tater fries.
Mix all 3 (reg curl sweet) and create combo with burger...$14. SOLD!!!</Review>

It also comes with a piece of seasoned bread. The staff is fast and friendly and the actually location is small but cozy. However, I'm not a huge fan of their sandwiches, I wish they had more vegetarian options.< /Text>< gmap_id>

My favorites are the club and the falafel, both excellent (and large!) Decent beer selection, too.
Usually pretty crowded during peak hours and don't forget they close relatively early - 8:30 as of this writing!<//Text>

< Review>
Delicious gourmet sandwiches.

I walked in on a Sunday afternoon and the first thing I noticed as I scanned the room were a sea of women in yoga pants and puffy jackets eating big ass bowls of salad. So in my yoga pants, I ordered a big ass sandwich instead. Stretchy waist band to the rescue.

No, I'm not spending over $15 on a salad! Granted I must admit they looked pretty good after watching the chefs in the back make them with their spread of freshly chopped ingredients. I'd rather spend my money on real food though...
Got pretty crowded - be prepared to share a table. Two single stalls of restrooms in the back.

Ordered:
Rooster Sandwich $13
Soft, freshly baked ciabatta bread with avocado, chipotle sauce, chicken, bacon and cheese. It was slightly toasted and it was friggin delicious.

With their expansive menu of sandwiches, I'd be back to try more.</Review>

I've never been disappointed by a burger here, and the starters are decent too.

Plusses:
- I went with a vegetarian friend who was quite impressed by his veggie burger and the list of vegetarian options
- The burgers are juicy and big, and the specialty ones are a good mix of seasoning - I get the hickory or caribbean
- The onion rings are a delicious starter and the fries aren't bad either (sweet potato are obviously the best) and they also have a pretty good fried vegetable dish as a starter

Minuses:
- You're a bit exposed in the outside seating area - no real block off from the sidewalk, no awning<//review>

Marin!  Get over paying for overpriced sandwiches and salads!  When you pay $10 bucks for a BLT there is something wrong in the cosmos.  Mostly a chick place with salads galore while they talk VERY LOUDLY and munch on greens.

Nice concept for somewhere but we have many more like it in Main, and better!< /review>

this little place is on one of my favorite streets in the city, chestnut street.
it is a local area down by the marina with so many good restaurants
and shops. this is the perfect lunch spot with friends,because they have
fresh healthy salads and the best sandos {including gourmet grilled
cheese!} i love building my own salad, and we love all the healthy
options! they have now expanded to polk street as well.< /Review>

I'm not a huge salad fan, Plutos is ok but I find it hard to spend money on something you could easily put together at home. Plus, I always prefer a warm meal, preferably with lots of meat.

Blue Barn is however the exception. Their salads are so fresh and I love the dressings.<//Review>

I ate hear roughly once a month in 2011 and 2012, and then stopped going, for a few reasons.  First, it's really loud in there, and after a while that started to grate on me.  Second, the speed and quality of the service declined over time.  Third, while the burgers are good, they're really not *that* amazing, and the salads are below average for San Francisco.<//text>

A nice place with quality food at a fair price compared to the rest of SF. The staff are really polite and are always smiling. Kids had colouring to do with their kids menu. Food, when served, is well presented and in large portions. Also get great fast WiFi, tested at 10mps compared to some other places with just half a MB download speed. Full after a the meal, and need a good walk afterwards.< /review>

Best takeout salads in SF and some of the best sandwiches as well (the rooster is excellent). More expensive than some alternatives, but blue barn gets all the details right. Extremely fresh (and local) ingredients, perfect balance of flavors, and just the right amount of dressing.

There will be lines. You will wait longer than you want for your food. You'll pay a few extra bucks for your salad/sando. Be patient... Or if the few extra bucks and/or the wait is too much to handle, then walk a couple blocks down the street to settle for shmeh at Plutos, where you can get a cheaper, more mediocre salad.</text>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>A friend treated us to lunch here and that's how I ended up here a second time. I recalled visiting Blue Barn two or three years ago, but I could not remember how my meal went or why I never went back.

I ordered the Truffle Sando which came with peppered turkey breast, brie d’affinois, balsamic onions, tomatoes, mixed greens, and truffled garlic aioli on herbed focaccia. There was a humble amount of balsamic onions which gave you a tangy bite without overshadowing the star, the truffled garlic aioli. The bread was fresh, the turkey moist, and they slaughtered a generous amount of aioli. It sounds great, but somehow ended up disappointing because it was surprisingly bland. It’s a decent sandwich but not something I’ll be craving for anytime soon.

My partner ordered the Kickin’ Chicken Sando which came with grilled chicken, a house made BBQ sauce, Niman bacon, smoked gouda, caramelized onions, and thyme slaw on a ciabatta roll. Everything was fresh just like my sandwich and the flavors were stick to your ribs good without the cardiac arrest effect. However I couldn’t get over the cold gouda which coated your mouth and made me forget that there were other elements in this sandwich.

I also ordered a side of fries with ketchup because I was told all dressings were house made. Then the cashier corrected himself and said that all dressings except for the ketchup, which is Heinz organic, is house made. I was slightly irked because I could have ordered the slightly less evil side salad drenched in dressing. We ended up trying their ranch and spicy mustard. I didn’t care for either one because there was too much buttermilk in the ranch and the mustard was too spicy for me.

Lunch did not live up to expectations here.< /Text>< time>

<Text>I really like their Kickin’ Chicken sandwich.
Grilled chicken, barn bbq sauce, niman bacon, smoked gouda, caramelized onion & thyme slaw on a ciabatta roll.

I went there for "the Rooster" sandiwch but meh, it was too mild and bland.
The ingredients: Chili-lime grilled chicken, niman bacon, white cheddar, avocado, roma tomato & chipotle aioli on a ciabatta roll... sound better than it was.<//Text>< Pictures>

The food is very good, but the service is so bad/slow that the food quality no longer makes up for it.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Absolutely fresh, tasty burgers. There are many different variants for every taste! Highly recommended - deduction for the atmosphere of the location. Here, the ambience gives the feeling of a fast food chain ...
I recommend it !!

<review>Great option for quick dinner you don't have to prepare.  Usually consistent pizza creations, but on rare occasion you might get a pizza not as well constructed.

Great value in pricing. Pizzas bake up quickly.

Service is typical of entry level workers with little supervision, sometimes it's good, sometimes okay, adequate, and sometimes you grin and bear it giving teenaged attitude some slack. You're just there for a quick meal option and then you're out of there.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We really feel this is the best pizza in town. You can have it made on thin or regular crust. We start by picking one of the special combo pizza specials and adding some items and taking off a like number of items. They have everything available and they are all top quality. We get thin crust and love  the way we can bake it  in our oven. We always add a good amount of oregano before baking. We bake for 10 min on the provided baking platter and then take it off with our pizza peal and finish it on our pizza stone.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8085b153f93d16a1:0xdc07e3658a57175a<//GmapID></record>

My first experience at this take and bake pizza place. Great very thin crust and nice assortment of toppings. On my visit the staff  (two young women) were snippy and unpleasant. No greating and I was the only customer in the place. When I asked questions I got an eye roll and was told that ingredients are listed on the wall. I explained I can't see the wall clearly I left my other glasses in the car. Another eye roll and a sigh. However that aside pizza was very good and reasonably priced.< /review>

< Review>
Good pizza and if you sign up for their text messages you can get some great deals on pizzas. I only had one problem with them though. There was a special for a three meat pizza that cost six or seven dollars. I said that I wanted one but asked if I could only have one meat on it, they said that wouldn't be the special and wanted to charge me nearly fourteen dollars. Really? You realize that you're saving money on the meat you aren't putting on the pizza, right?? I ended up not buying a single meat pizza for fourteen bucks. Next time I'll just get the special and take the meat off myself.

Come on people, think for yourselves. I know it's a special but I'm not asking for extras, I'm asking for less. That's better for your company. Think people, think.< /Review>

We can never order what we actually want. Instead of having what I want on a stuffed pizza, I have to choose between 3 predone choices on their menu. I should be able to have whatever I want on my pizza, especially if I am paying for it AND cooking it myself. If my other half is going to pick up the order, they refuse to hear what their name is and are pretty rude about it. Won't be going back anymore.<//review>

We've patronized this Papa Murphy's for 15 years and found it a fine establishment, but the service has deteriorated in recent months.  Amazingly, the last 4 pizzas we ordered were not prepared as requested.  Check carefully before leaving with your pizza to determine if you're getting what you ordered.< /text>

<Text>I stopped by this Papa Murphys location on a whim and grabbed a large gourmet veggie pizza. The place was clean casual & quiet and it was under a minute wait to order. The Cute & friendly pizza assembly girl behind the counter wasted no time creating my pie, wrapping it up, & handing it over to me along with a lovely smile and "Thank you. Have a wonderful evening." Although it was a couple days after Christmas they still had the coolest holiday  window painting up for decoration to enjoy. It featured a snowy outdoor scene with a snowman some cabins and santa climbing a fence. Not to out of the ordinary until you walk inside and see the back of fhe whole scene pictured from the reverse perspective with Santa eating a big slice of pizza. Creative, cute, & entertaining, twas window painting money well spent.

<text>So being new to the area, and seeing how this  is the nearest food store to home I decided go shopping here. The place was a mess! Old produce soon made me realize why the parking lot was empty. After a few months I received a store ad. One day as I drove by I noticed the outside of the store looked much better since I had last shopped here. Stupid me decided to give it a second try. Big mistake!! Although it appears to look much better,, produce wise,, the frozen and packaged foods are either EXPIRED or close to expiring. Disgusting!! Not sure how this place is still open.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d6810330e80f:0xfaba408f554bb3c0</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's a typical hispanic restaurant. Not as large as other grocery stores but it is easily accessible and gives faster access than some of the other grocery locations. Service is decent and store is well maintained.< /Text>

The price of beer is high. Their customer service is not great and their selection on food items is limited. I bought their store packed chicharones and they were stale.</text>

Its a smaller market with sometimes not-so-fresh items in terms of produce and the like, but its convenient and you can find a bit of everything here.<//Text>

Meat Dept. blasts aweful music. Meat looks old. Veggies are rarely ripe, or they look old. Overpriced items. Example, ice cream drumsticks. Look them up. Double the price of any other market and its the small pack.< /Text>

Upon entering you realize a bad smell that comes from the meat department, cleanliness and order are very bad. Customer service very bad, you will rarely see someone to help you. The little service that butchers give you will make you go to any other place to buy before there.

Possibly next time I will give 2 stars if the cashier does not yawn while there are customers.

(Original)
Para mi gusto uno de los supermercados con muy mala calidad, algunos precios están al doble sobre otros lugares.

Al entrar te das cuenta de un mal olor que viene del departamento de carnes, la limpieza y el orden son muy pésimos. El servicio al cliente muy mal, raramente verás a alguien para ayudarte. El escaso servicio que te dan los carniceros te orillan a que vayas a cualquier otro sitio a comprar antes que ahí.

Posiblemente la próxima vez le de 2 estrellas si la cajera no bosteza mientras haya clientes.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This is very good because I have it close to where I live but only that the clients are already retiring because I, on the one hand, ate something when I got hungry but now I don't go because they took the rich food that avia was cooked and aside there are some workers from this place that are Asians treat us very hard and badly

(Translated by Google) Most of the products he sells are already expired, he had always bought ahy, not now. Now, when I get to the house, I start to open something, I realize that it doesn't work, I'm sorry for them, but I won't be their client anymore.

I couldn’t have prayed for a better dentist!!! Everyone at this office is always helpful and the services they provide are the best I’ve ever had and they do such a good job that they should be charging double the amounts they charge but they always put their patients first and respect the fact that we don’t want to be charged a lot. And if you call the office and they have to put you on hold the hold music is actually entertaining and fun to listen too 😊. I will be referring all my family and friends over to Mesa Dental 🦷</Text>

One thing that stood out to me when I was researching this place is that they claim: "we eliminate fear with one rule: love". I have had a couple thousand dollars worth of work done here in the past year and I can attest that all the staff, and especially Dr. Qadeer himself, really live up to that claim. I truly have felt loved and cared about. And my teeth are in great shape now too!<//review>

However, after reading your review I called you to clear the misunderstanding you had about the treatment plan.  Per our phone conversation, your entire co-pay is only $565 with your insurance, which is not the $3,200 UCR fee that you had mentioned in your review that is for three different types of restorations.\nFor your information, a UCR fee is an amount paid for a medical or dental service in a geographic area based on what providers in the area usually charge for the same or similar medical service without any insurance.  This is only listed on the treatment plan for your information. In fact, the $3200 is not for a single treatment, but is an accumulative cost for three different types of services.\nWe hope this better clarifies the misunderstanding we had and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.\nGod bless\nDr. Qadeer and Mesa Dental Team.'}</Response>< pics>

All I needed done at the time being was my teeth cleaned and a replacement crown for a crown that had came off a week ago. It took them a total of five whole minutes for my teeth cleaning. I was rushed through, and barely talked to. Then they wanted to charge $3200 just for a new crown. That is triple the amount of any crown I’ve ever heard of anyone paying. The root canal was already done years ago, so it was that much for just for the crown. I rarely comment or post reviews, but I wanted to make all aware of this place. Shame on you guys.</text>< user_name>

I’ve been on the search for a good quality dentist for quite sometime. Mesa Dental had great reviews so I took a chance. To my surprise, this place exceeded my expectations. The staff is genuinely friendly and I felt welcomed upon entrance to exit. The dentist displayed great professionalism and had a sense of humor. Will visit again.</text>

Was looking in getting my dental implants and my friend referred me to Mesa Dental as she had gotten 4 implants from them and she had nothing but wonderful things to say. Fast forward 6 months later and Dr. Qadeer did a wonderful job and my smile is back to new again. Friendly staff and Dr. Qadeer is a delight. Great chair manners and always making us laugh.< /text>

<review>I wanted to like this place, based off the reviews and I did at first.  All the staff were nice, friendly and Dr. Qadeer was nice too.  However, once I reviewed the pricing for a crown which was way more expensive than my last one at a previous dentist, I called to inquire what a lava crown upgrade is and the lady told me it's the porcelain crown.  That's great and all but I want the standard porcelain crown.  Apparently they are both the same high price.  I contacted my insurance to dispute and even they agreed they were overcharging me and contacted Mesa Dental to tell them to give me the insurance rate.  I was supposed to get a call from them to discuss further, but at this point it's grounds for dismissal. You have to beware of cosmetic dental place because clearly they can charge you upgraded prices for fancier things you don't want. I will switch to another dentist that suits my needs.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Let me just say I went to this dental office because I saw that he had mostly positive reviews. I went to the office to get an opinion from the doctor. Let me say, as we know , sadly in this country many dentists just like vets are trying to milking the cow. They are using fear in order to tax patients as much as possible. I went to this office hoping he will be different. He was not. I was straight forward with the dentist into the fact that I didn't want to be tax more. His answer was he does not care about money, he has plenty of money. He cared about his patients. Now comes the moment of my exam. He pretty much told me I needed an all in 4 implants which i kind of expected. He told me the cost would be 23K, I asked if he had any payment plan, any solution, he said I can do via their loan office they use but with almost 18% interest (a lot). I left, he never even follow up with me, contacted me, trying to find a solution. Basically, his behavior was if you can afford, let's do it, if not go find your solution, go pay some high interest and come back. Sir, if you cared that much about your patient, you would find a way to help them, find some payment plan where they wouldnt have to pay double the cost in interest. Hugg all dentists are just the same!!!< /text>

I have been to many dental offices throughout my life and I must say, I have never had such a great experience as I did with Mesa dental. Right of the bat I knew Dr Arash knew his stuff! He didn’t BS around, he got to the point and  made sure I understood the procedure. Most dentists tell you what they want to do and it’s up to you to decode what their doing. This doctor calmly explained everything, leaving nothing unturned. I highly recommend Dr Arash.<//Review>

Came to get invisalign as they had a nice special. From the moment i walked into the office, i knew i had found the place. Very friendly staff and Dr. Qadeer helped and explained everything in detail as to the next step. I am almost done with my Invisalign and couldn’t be happier with the results already.< /Review>

Had been going to Dr Qadeer for a couple years and everything went really well until my last visit. I’ve had a lot of dental work and crowns over the years and one had recently came loose. Went to Dr Qadeer and he said we can try to re-cement it but if it comes loose again we’ll have to completely re-do the build-up and a new crown. Okay made sense. 3 weeks later same crown comes loose again. I didn’t have the money to pay for a whole new crown out of pocket so I figured I’d get it re-cemented again and wait a year or so until I can afford another crown. This time I decided to just go to TJ to have it re-cemented because it’s a simple job and much cheaper. The dentist down there pulled the loose crown off, inspected the tooth and determined everything was still fine (no cavitiy) and we can re-cement it. He then commented “we’ll use permanent cement this time. Whoever did it last time used temporary cement for some reason.” It seems as if Dr Qadeer used temporary cement knowing full well that the crown would come loose again in a couple weeks so then he could sell me on a new crown replacement. It’s now been several months later since the crown was re-attached using permanent cement and no issues.<//Text>

<time>1614794441923<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Set up for new patient appointment was so easy. I sent a few emails back and forth, with my insurance information, new patient forms, and they set me up with an appointment. No need to call if you don't have the time - they are very responsive via email, which made things super easy. When I arrived to my appointment, front desk ladies were very nice. I was called back by a woman (I wish I remembered her name, because she was extremely friendly) who took my xrays and eventually polished my teeth. Dr. Qadeer was patient, kind, and luckily informed me that I had zero work that needed to be done. After the exam, my teeth were polished and the hygienist Stephanie took care of me from there. In total, I think this is a great place, and they've hired some quality individuals. I can't wait to come back in 6 months.</review>< pics>

I know Dr Qadeer for over 15 years. I have followed him wherever he goes. It is hard to find a dentist that you can trust, one that presents facts and provide you options, one that doesn't force you to go through procedures if it's not needed and above all professional and friendly. I highly recommend Dr Qadeer. Looks like his clinic got busy over the years , which means that I'm right.< /review>

If you are looking for a kind, comfortable, professional and high quality dentist office this is it!! Dr. Qadeer  is amazing! Kind, professional, intelligent, and soooo nice. It's like he exudes a calming aura that just makes you feel better. All I can say is wow. I was concerned looking for a new dentist after moving from Boston but Mesa Dental made it easy to make an immediate appointment. I also had some concerns about my wisdom teeth that made me feel scared to have them looked at. Dr. Qadeer made all of my worries go away by thoroughly explaining my dental health. He also made sure I knew that he believed my pain & discomfort which was really important to me as a woman of color. He made me feel comfortable and confident by giving me a treatment plan for my gums and even gave me new tips on flossing. He even took the time to explain what the oral surgeon would do and how the oral surgeon would make a treatment plan for me.

The equipment for the cleaning was all high quality and new. Even the radiation guards  for x-rays were better than I have experienced and went all the way up to the neck. After my appointment a staff member explained in plain English Dr. Qadeer's treatment plan and how to follow up. I really really loved it here and am excited to be his new patient!< /Text>

Not only has he helped me for years with my very British teeth he also did my Invisalign for me. And look at the results!! I recommend him a thousands time over if you are looking for a great dentist. I would not write a review unless I meant every word. The picture speaks for itself. Thank you so so much Dr Qadeer!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I continue to be impressed with Dr. Qadeer and his entire staff.  They are efficient, yet pleasant and friendly.  Dr. Qadeer is, without parallel, a brilliant dentist.  He deeply cares about his patients.  I was a "dental chicken" when it came to dental work.  Dr. Qadeer calmly eased my fears and with his expertise in injecting the numbing agent, I no longer have pain in the dental chair.  I highly recommend this practice.</review>

<Text>I drive 1-2 hours just to go to this dentist. Staff is friendly and I love them. Especially Amy who always makes sure I’m doing well even if she doesn’t work with me that day. She really care for her patients.

During COVID-19 I felt super safe. Everyone was protected with more than enough PPE.< /Text><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

<review>I loved Dr. Nassery. I've tried to give Dr. Qadeer a chance but he makes mistakes and contradicts the patient.  I don't like that.  I've spent THOUSANDS of dollars on crown work here.  Why would I lie about anything? Dr. Qadeer is awful.  Don't come here< /review><gmap_id>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As someone who has spent so much time in the dentist chair and has been horrified of dentist. Finding Mesa Dental was a blessing. I was so tired of have multiple crowns replaced because they weren’t putting the correct ones on. I was ready to have all my teeth pulled and go with total implants when I found Doctor Qadeer he said no way he would pull them that he could save all of them! He did just that 8 Zirconia crowns later and a filling along with a mouth guard I feel good again! All my crowns I came in with had bad cavities underneath most were less then 4 years old one had come off .
The entire staff is AMAZING from the receptionist to all of the people in the back behind the scenes, This office has the nicest and most educated dental assistances I have ever seen. They were wonderful about making me feel comfortable. I felt safe while they were working on me, something I’ve never felt in any other office and with all the work I had done I pretty much had all of them at one time or another!
But the most Amazing of all was Doctor Qadeer! He is so kind, gental, comforting always making me feel at ease never making me feel Anxious even though my blood pressure I know goes up like crazy when I walk into a dental office. He takes his time with me always doing a first Rate job! I will always be greatful to Mesa Dental for changing my life and giving me a reason to smile again😊. Thank you all.  Joan Marko<//text>

Changed from another dentist to this one, great experience, everyone was very friendly and I felt like the staff cared about the patients, last dentist I was at told me I needed an entire crown to fix a broken cavity filling on a molar and here the Doctor said it's a simple removal of the pieces and replacement!  Tell you what, removing and fixing the filling is way cheaper than a crown!<//Text>

So far this place is amazing! The doctor is so kind and accommodating and his staff is very professional. I absolutely hate dentists and dentist office and visits and I always feel slightly at ease coming here knowing I’ll be taken care of. Another great thing is they do not gouge your pockets. Prices are fair. Would recommend this office to anyone looking for a new place.<//Text>

I have had the best experience at Mesa Dental. I have always had a huge fear of the dentist, until coming here. Everyone is incredibly friendly, caring and make you feel like your at home when coming in. They have helped me conquer my fears of needles and going to the dentist. I got veneers  about 8 years ago and I constantly get complements on how amazing my teeth look. People are always shocked when I tell them they are not my real teeth! I now send my husband, family members and any friends who are looking for a dentist.<//review>

I had a hard time finding a good dentist when I moved to SD 10 years ago. About 6 years ago I found Mesa Dental and I’ve never left. I highly recommend Stephanie (one of the hygienists), she is gentle and extremely nice. Dr Qadeer is also very kind and extremely honest. I never feel that I am being upsold. Totally recommend this group.< /review>

Mesa Dental is easily the most welcoming, friendly, relaxed and professional dental office I've ever stepped foot in. From the front office staff, support staff, head dentist, and everyone else in between. Their professionalism and care make me feel like I am always in good hands. I have grown to trust them 100%. I also must add that they're super quick in making sure you're serviced in a timely manner, never waiting around too long also perfect for the families always on the move. I don't see myself having to switch anytime soon. I can't recommend this office enough.< /review>

My Mesa Dental experience was great!  Dr. Qadeer and his staff were very friendly and down to earth.   The office is very relaxing and they play great 80's music while you wait.  My dental needs were very unique in that I needed to replace a failed front tooth with a dental implant.   This process took several months to complete but the result was very satisfying.  I have an awesome smile and I can now bite into an apple with no pain or discomfort.  If you haven't found a family dentist yet, please check out Dr. Qadeer office.  He will treat you like family.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Update: the dentist called me personally to better understand why the office did not get 5 stars. He had me come back in for a more detailed consultation to plan the treatment of my teeth. Way to go Mesa Dental! Stars updated to reflect their good customer service and care for quality.
Everyone was very nice. But, I made an appointment for an exam and cleaning and did not get a cleaning or explanation why not. I needed to speak with the dentist about my teeth and the plan to fix them but he was in such a hurry to move on that he developed his own without me and then left the room.  I need surgery and orthodontics in order to fix the severe overcrowding, but he didn't even take enough time looking at my teeth to see that. Then I am handed an estimate for over $6000. Nice does not equal quality. I am going to look to a dentist who will involve me in the plan to fix my teeth. Or at least stop talking long enough to hear what I expect the outcome to be similar to.< /Text>< Pics>

The staff at Mesa Dental are always very friendly! They do a great job. They were able to fit me in for a last minute appointment at the time that worked for me and I’m very thankful for that! 👍🏻

2/20/20 Update: I've been a patient at Mesa Dental for going on 5 years now. Dr. Qadeer is very friendly, makes you feel comfortable, and does a great job. The dental hygienists and front desk staff are also friendly and helpful. In my last visit, they gave me a very fair price for something that would have likely cost more somewhere else. I do believe they want to work with their patients, do what is best for them, and make sure that you return again. Many people I know have a lot of dental horror stories, and I'm glad that I cannot relate to them! Thank you Mesa Dental :)< /Review>

The cleaning was a bit too fast. Didnt feel like they took the care and attention to do a really good job. I think they have a lot of patients and concerned about moving patients along as quickly as possible.

Update March 2020: Dr Kadeer ended up reaching out to me and offered a full cleaning at no cost. It was again a swift cleaning but the Dr was patient and clear to communicate that they use state of the art equipment and is actually more effective than older standard methods.  I guess I'm used to the old standard ways of my prior dentist. I appreciate that he took the time to explain and treat me with respect. I admit perhaps I was not the most informed customer and have to give them a lot of credit for taking those extra steps for me.</review>

<Review>This is the best dentist.. ever! I have had a number of issues with my porcelain crowns and they kept cracking. I came in and on our 2nd attempt with a porcelain crown, it cracked on impact because of bite strength. (& I’m a grinder) Right then and there, he offered me a new gold crown, free of charge, took outstanding care of not only my dental health, but they treated my 1 year old like family whenever she came in 🙏 & my little girl can definitely be a lot to handle when mommy’s in the dentist office for an hour plus! They were considerate, passionate, took care of ALL my needs, and made me feel more than welcome. I recommend this office to anyone even if it’s in San Diego! I live in LA and I still made the drive to only come here! I never had any regrets, and neither will you!!!! 🙏 thank you!

<text>Terrible they do not go by the co-payments with your insurance company! They use their own pricing what ever that may be? They need to be investigated! They’re over charging their customers! I do not recommend!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>The staff is so friendly! Always kind and caring. I always have a great experience when I visit for my appointments.

Typically going to the dentist is no fun. Needles, drilling and accidentally biting your tongue and not feeling it til after the numbing goes away when you’re just trying to enjoy a carne asada burrito, or your drink spills out the side of your mouth and you don’t realize it lol. But for some reason, the staff at Mesa Dental make all the drama of post appointments not seem to matter. Their knowledge, experience and humor always make my visits warm and enjoyable. Even when the doc is cracking jokes during a root canal!

I will always go to Mesa Dental for my dental needs. Thank you!< /review>< pics>

I have been coming to Mesa Dental to see Dr. Qadeer for about two years now. Not only is Dr. Qadeer one of the nicest gentlemen you'll ever meet, he is very thorough, communicative, and always makes you feel like you're in good hands. His staff is friendly and efficient, and I've never had a less than positive experience with anyone at his office. I also like that you can pay for a membership and get discounted rates on services. At the time I signed up I needed some work done and it was a better deal than dental insurance for me, and I have just stayed with it as it covers two cleanings and two x-rays per year. I would definitely recommend Mesa Dental to anyone searching for a solid dentist.</text>

<Text>This place is great. I’ve been seen as a patient about 3 times now. The service is definitely a step up from corporate dental offices, where they nickel and dime you. Dr. Qadeer is professional and courteous. He honestly tells his opinion about certain options and procedures, and he always leaves decisions up to the patient. My previous dental office would just say “you need to do X, okay will that be cash or card?” It always felt so sleazy. Dr. Qadeer, on the other hand, will always say “my professional opinion is X. If you want to proceed, set up an appointment with the front, and we can consult more in detail.” Keep up the good work!!<//Text>< Time>

I love this office! Everyone is so wonderful and caring and make u feel at home. Usually going to a dentist makes me nervous and anxious but I never feel that way here. Dr. Qadeer is amazing and the best dentist! I always feel at ease and comfortable when I’m getting work done. And his staff is amazing. I would give 10 stars if I could :-)<//text>

Mesa dental is my new spot! I was looking for a new dental office within network and I was really impressed with how well reviewed this office was. Upon arrival the office waiting area is nice and wide with TVs and a mini fridge that offers water. The front desk was really nice as I expected but  the great customer service continued through my visit. I was impressed with the dentist taking the time to review my X-rays and giving me a run down of my dental health. Overall 5 stars. I've been here twice now and o know I'll continue to come. I have even referred three people here because I truly feel this office cares about customer service!
One thing I noticed about this office that I have started to dislike about my last office is that they are honest about what you need without pushing sales...

Also, they have have plenty of parking and the 163 freeway entrance is right out of their parking lot.< /text>

Absolute sharks. Leaving the area and was told my dental work would be done in time for me to leave, get charged 5k and then get told they won't finish my dental work. Now to cancel it's going to cost 2k. What kinda BS is this.<//review>

This was my first time at the dentist office and everyone was very welcoming and friendly.  The office was very clean and the environment was very comfortable. The staff made me feel very welcome and they were very professional.  Dr Qadeer was great and I felt very comfortable with him right away.  He was very thorough and explained everything regarding my treatment which turned out to be more than what I expected.  I would definitely recommend him and his staff to potential customers.</Review>

He does a great job distracting you from the more unpleasant parts of the procedures so before you know it, it's over. His staff are also really nice and helpful and make a point to check in on you throughout your whole appointment.<//Text>< Pictures>

<username>Elaine Allen</username><time>1575568090222<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>Due to horribly weak teeth and an insatiable sweet tooth, my dental needs have always been ridiculously extensive.  When I was in third grade, a dentist told me that I would be in full dentures by the age of 21.
Well, 50 years later, I am happy to say that didn't happen but, it probably would have if not for advancements in dentistry and endless hours spent in a dental chair.  Having so much experience with Dentists and having been subjected to more dental procedures than any one person should ever have to endure in a single lifetime; I consider myself to be somewhat of an expert on dentists.
With that said, my review of Mesa Dental is that they are my all-time favorite dental practice.  My family and I have been going there for three years now and my only complaint is that I wish we had found them many years earlier.  Dr. Qadeer is a superb dentist and it is obvious that he truly care about his patients.  He is always cheerful and friendly, listens carefully to what you have to say, and makes you feel comfortable and confident that you are in good hands, getting quality dental care.  The entire staff at Mesa Dental are a reflection of Dr. Qadeer's positive attitude in that they are always friendly, welcoming, and willing to help you with all your needs.
I highly recommend Mesa Dental and Dr. Qadeer to anyone seeking quality dental care in a friendly and caring environment.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>I've had fairly bad experiences at dentist's offices. I have a very small mouth by nature, and I'd had dental assistants be quite disparaging and outright rude about having to work in my mouth. As a result I hadn't been to a dentist for an embarrassing amount of time before a friend recommended Dr. Qadeer's office to me. Any anxiety I had about the visit were gone as soon as I walked into the office. The office itself is lovely, as are the folks working there--every person is warm and inviting. And Dr. Qadeer himself is just the friendliest, most informative person you've ever met. He knew immediately ailments I was likely suffering from as a Type 1 Diabetic and provided me with an amazing amount of information and statistics about dental care with attention I've never received from another dentist. That first visit I discovered that I needed two root canals and had some cavities (that's what 5ish years away from the dentist will get you). The nervousness came back a little at mention of a root canal--was my small mouth going to be an issue again? But the team acknowledged my small opening with respect and in a matter of fact kind of way, instead of implying that it was somehow my fault or a burden (as past dentists had). And the root canal itself was a breeze!!! People had reacted to my news that I needed a root canal with looks of despair and fear, but I barely felt a thing! Dr. Qadeer and his team are heavensent and I cannot recommend them enough (honestly, I promptly recommended them to my sister, my sister's wife, and my mom, and all three have gone and ALSO loved the team).</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This is a great place.  Excellent staff and solid dentists.  They put together a quality treatment program for me, walked me through the whole process, and made sure I understood everything every step of the way.  The support staff and dental assistants are great and they were even very understanding when I had to make a last minute appointment cancellation and didn't charge me for it.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a dentist in San Diego.</Text>

Started my dental journey back in August after moving back from Asia. I went in super nervous, but mainly embarrassed because I’d not stepped into a dental office in 10 years. I found Mesa Dental through a coworker and could be more pleased!!! From the moment I stepped in the door I’ve received nothing but quality service. I cried at my consolation from embarrassment due to the state of my mouth but mainly because I felt so supported by Dr. Qadeer and his team. I was reassured that everything was fixable and that they were there to help, I felt super comfortable, informed and cared for through the whole process. They worked with me tailored my treatment plan to be accommodate me. Since my first visit I have raved about my experienced and have referred my whole office. Today I came in for my first Invisalign tray and couldn’t be more satisfied. Service remained consistent across the board. Dr. Qadeer and Jimmy were super accommodating to my teeth sensibility and we’re constantly checking in with me to see if I was feeling okay. I have always left the office feeling confident and reassured that I am one step closer to my perfect smile. 100% recommend, no hesitation!<//text>

If you had a father, mother,uncle, aunt, brother, sister or cousin who was a highly skilled and esteemed dental practitioner, surrounded in their practice by equally committed family members to your dental health, would you go anywhere else? Especially if they made their high quality services available to fit your budget?

A trip to Mesa Dental will leave you feeling better than a trip to a spa.  I go at least 4 times a year just to make sure I'm taking the best care of my teeth possible.  See you there!< /Text>

Because Dr. Qadeer and his entire staff always treat me nice and welcoming, he is always made me calm and so at ease. Dr. Qadeer is a professionalist, kind, caring, thorough with his explanations and insure that a procedure is done exactly right.
I strongly recommend Dr. Qadeer and his as great staff to who are looking for the best Dentist.<//text>< Resp>

Dr. Qadeer and his staff are fantastic!  The staff is friendly and helpful. They put you at ease, making you feel welcome. Dr. Qadeer himself is friendly and kind. He explains everything carefully. His manner is respectful and gentle. I have always felt I’ve received the best of care with thorough dental work as needed. Only the necessary dental work is recommended without pressure to receive unnecessary work on my teeth. Doctor and staff do have options for cosmetic work should I request it. I personally have never felt more comfortable at a dentists office and will continue to work with Mesa Dental.</text>

I needed an implant before I got my Invisalign and I'm so happy I found this practice. The whole process was went with such ease. Really glad I found a office that actually cares for the well being of their patients. I even got a call from the doctor the day after my implant was placed to make sure I'm doing good. Then a week later I hear from him again to see how everything went. I have to say I was and I'm still very impressed by this practice. Thanks again<//review>

Mesa Dental is awesome! I have been searching all over San Diego for a good dentist and office and I have finally found it! They don't try to upsell you on other services and Amy does not kill your mouth when cleaning your teeth. They were so friendly and made my experience comfortable and convenient. I will definitely WANT to go to the dentist again. Thank you all for an awesome experience!</text>

I had my first exam/cleaning at this office today and everyone was wonderful. I arrived a bit before my appointment time and was taken in right away which was nice. My hygienist did an amazing job and was very gentle, yet thorough. I will definitely be making this my new regular dentist. Thank you all at Mesa Dental!< /text>

<review>I am really happy with the service from Dr Qadeer. I've been coming here since 3 years now. I've had 4 root canals and 6 crowns and 3 fillings from here. No complaints about the quality of work done. Very neat work by the doctor. Must say the doctor is very considerate and made sure I feel comfortable throughout the procedure. He's been very gentle while working on my teeth too. I've referred 2 of my friends here and I guess as long as I am in San Diego Dr.Qadeer will be my dentist.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Every visit is Great!! The staff are friendly, the work stations are clean and best of all I am never in any pain or discomfort while being worked on. The Dr. Qadeer is fast, efficient and courteous. They all answer any questions that may come up with the best of attitudes. There has never been long waits in the lobby and they are flexible with scheduling. I recommend Mesa Dental to everyone.</Review>< GmapID>

Never thought I’d say I LOVED getting a filling! I was totally freaked out and nervous and Dr. Qadeer put my mind at ease. There was no pain, and I felt that I was in control and could ask him to pause at any time. I felt comfortable, and the staff was funny and kind. I am a new loyal patient to this office, and I’d strongly recommend them to anyone who is afraid of the dentist - they got me over my fear!</Text>

Dr. Qadeer and his team are really friendly and patient with you. I had some bad anxiety my first two visits because I've had terrible dentist experiences in the past. The warm welcoming environment here really makes a difference. Plus, you get to see before and after pictures of the teeth they work on. My only critique is that it gets really busy.< /text>

I really love Mesa Dental! Whether it's scheduling an appointment, taking x-rays or cleaning your teeth, the staff is incredibly positive and they do their best to make you feel comfortable.
Dr Qadeer is a wealth of knowledge and genuinely cares about his patients.
I always feel like "part of the family" when I walk into Mesa Dental. It's definitely a place you can trust!<//text>

I was referred here by a friend and I am so glad she did. I had been postponing a dentist visit for the longest time for obvious reasons :p. But after going here my perspective changed entirely. Dr Qadeer is such a lively person, he sure knows how to keep your spirits high when you are on that dentist chair. Very professional and thorough with his work. I had 2 root canals done in a single visit and it went so smooth. The staff there are an amazing bunch too. Max was so patient and made sure I was comfortable through out the procedure. Shout out to Jimmy & Benny too. I would definitely be going back here for as long as I am in San diego for any of my dental needs and recommending it to others too!</Review>

BEFORE I found Mesa Dental, I strongly disliked going to the dentist. NOW, I actually don’t mind going! Every employee I have encountered is friendly and really cares about my comfort while I’m there!  Dr. Qadeer is first-class and I trust him with my smile, which is very expensive after braces when I was younger and now Invisalign! I highly recommend Mesa Dental to anyone looking for a great dentist in the San Diego area, especially if past dentist experiences have been rather displeasing! Thanks Mesa!</review>

Very friendly staff. They explain everything to you and are very caring. Dr.Qadeer is the coolest dentist I've met. I was a new patient and I'm so happy I found this place. I'm sitting in the chair now and I'm very impressed. They squeezed me in to fix an emergency filling that fell out before my business trip in two days. Wouldn't want to go anywhere else. They set the standard!<//Text>

<text>There are plenty of dentists good and bad and don’t get me wrong Mesa is on the good side of dentists thanks to Dr. Qadeer but one thing in common with all dentists is that they try to spend the shortest time as possible w/each patient at the maximum cost to the patient, and leave the dirty work to the assistants. If you don’t have insurance, you’re screwed! 💰💸
But 1 little known difference between Mesa and others is Mesa asks patients to write reviews and if they’re negative, they’re asked to change them after they’ve been posted. I know because it happened to me. They are using lots of smoke and mirrors on social media to inflate their ratings. Just look at their other social media posts. Is any dentist perfect? Impossible! That's the result when you ask only happy patients to review and negative reviews are asked to edit. I will never change this review and wish it to remain here for eternity for all to see. I wish to remain anonymous for obvious reasons but I have had extensive work done w/ Dr. Qadeer but never again. I have my reasons and will keep them to myself out of fear of unwanted contact to edit this or feedback from the dentist himself trying to discount my claims or criticize me. Be aware!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Seriously, the best dentist I've ever been to. And literally a jaw saver! My other dentist recommended I get the bone on my jaw shaved down for a crown. That didn't seem right to me, so I decided to try another dentist and it was the best decision. Dr. Qadeer was able to make my crown without any bone shaving! Saved me thousands and my jaw. Can't thank them enough.</Review>

I cannot begin to describe how incredible this office is!!! I have seen many dentists in my life... but Doctor Qadeer and his staff are by far superior! Amazing people and fun environment! That’s right... I said fun! Haha I would recommend them to anyone! Especially those who have had bad experiences or fear visiting the dentist. They are incredibly gentle, informative and pressure free! Not to mention the work they do is amazing! I kid you not when I say that this office has changed the way that I feel about visiting the dentist.. and I feel so SO fortunate to have found them!!! Thanks Dr Q and team! Much love! ❤️❤️❤️❤️<//Text>

<Date>1556124026812<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Dr. Qadeer and the staff of Mesa Dental have made my dental journey much better than I could have ever expected. Dental hygiene was not a big part of my childhood which made me ashamed and afraid to go to the Dentist as an adult.

I've been going to Mesa Dental since October. I finally decided to make the trip because of a tooth that was giving me extreme pain. I was disappointed but not surprised to find out that I needed work on a few teeth.

Throughout this while process Dr. Qadeer and the the staff of Mesa Dental have treated me with respect and have given me a new feeling about going to the dentist. I no longer feel ashamed and look forward to taking care of dental hygiene.

My oldest has recently began doing to Mesa Dental as well. While I can't say that she shares the same level of joy that I do about dental hygiene, she has come a long way from her fear of dentist and has expressed how thorough Dr. Qadeer is. Her previous dentist told her that her teeth were good to go, only to find out she had some valid tooth pain which has since been resolved.

I can go on and on, everyone has different experiences, but I have never had a kinder or more through dental staff.  I truly do have a sence of comfort which is something I never thought I would feel going to the dentist.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Coming to this dental clinic was the best decision I have made, when my friend had recommended them to me I didn't imagine how good they are; the doctors there are highly professional and generous. They afford all the sufficient time and knowledge for consultation. Dr. nasery was kind and gentle, he removed all my fears and made me a perfect crown without feeling any pain or discomfort. I will recommend all my friends to come here too.</Review>

I LOVE MY DENTIST!!! I needed a lot of work done, and I'm so glad I carefully chose Mesa Dental!! They are worth every penny!! If you're going to make an investment on your teeth, I 100% recommend Dr. Qadeer! He is extremely professional, caring, and his facility is super clean. I could go on and on about how satisfied I am with my dentist, just his attitude alone makes you want to come back. You'll know what I'm referring too, once you experience GREAT QUALITY DENTAL CARE yourself. I wouldn't look elsewhere! Dr. Qadeer is the one! 🙂< /Review>

I had an amazing experience with Mesa Dental. I came in for a cosmetic fix. I had a crown done a few years ago that looked awful (traditional military handiwork) I decided I would go with a porcelain replacement.  It was a multistep procedure that left me with the perfect smile. It looks completely natural and I don't feel that grating sensation I had with my first crown. Great Experience!< /text>

In March 2012, I went to Mesa Dental for two crowns on my very front, top teeth (old sports injury).  Trust me, I would not give a vendor 5 stars unless they earned 5 stars.  That's how I am.  From my first visit to Mesa, I was treated very respectfully and with an overwhelmingly friendly attitude - from each and every staffmember.  They are attentive to details, truly interested in your physical appearance, and willing to explain the required procedures as well as cost/benefit of discretionary services.  They work with great partners (I was referred for a root canal) as well.  They were flexible in scheduling, and I was always seen by the dentist on time with no delay (series of 5 or 6 appointments).  I am now a lifelong customer of Mesa Dental, and I would recommend them to any family and friends.  My mouth is healthy, and my very prominent two front teeth look really amazing.<//review>

< review>
I spent almost 10 years avoiding the dentist because of experiencing a horrible dental visit in my early 20’s. Thankfully I was referred to Dr. Qadeer at Mesa Dental by a good friend when I was in desperate need and I haven’t missed a cleaning or appointment since.
Ive had several fillings and plenty of work to make up for the 10 years of no dental visits. I am so grateful to find such a knowledgeable and gentle dentist who has made the experience so much easier. The staff is all truly amazing as well.
The dentist for some of us can be so scary but what I’ve learned is you can’t judge all by one bad experience.
Thank you Dr. Qadeer and the staff for helping keep my smile healthy and beautiful!< /review>

<date>1544138187300<//date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Ive lived in San Diego for 7 years and have been to 5 different dentists. It's difficult to find a dentists who has the patients best interest in mind. Dr Qadeer is that dentist, he is extremely friendly and thorough with his work. He takes routine pictures to ensure that the patient knows exactly what is happening throughout the process and why they were treated. I never saw the entire process of a cavity filling unit I came to Mesa Dental, aside from being interesting I found it to be very reassuring that they cared about their work and the patients. Dr Qadeer takes his time with his patients and doesn't rush through his appointments, he treats you as if you were family. I would say that their 5 star rating is not "faked" as someone mentioned, all of the staff is genuinely helpful and friendly. All medical practices can get complicated when insurance is involved but this is BY FAR the best dentist I've had in San Diego and I would highly recommend them.</review>< Pics>

Excellent care! Especially for a dental-phobic like me. Had a dental emergency the day before a 3-day holiday/weekend while on vacation and they took me in as a walk-in. Great staff all around. Thanks again Dr. Qadeer for such great work and care.</review>

Leaving me messages on a phone number that I did not give them when they already have my personal number and have already left me voicemails. When I asked how they got that number they said because they have my wife's information on file. Her information is NOT mine. If you can't get my personal details right then I'm not definitely not trusting you with my care.< /text>

I've been overwhelmingly impressed with Mesa Dental. Dr. Qadeer helps me feel at ease, is careful and very gentle - something super important for those of us who hate to get our teeth worked on. I've had a crown put in elsewhere with great discomfort, and was really surprised to discover that with a good dentist, it doesn't have to be that way! Dr. Qadeer is highly professional and cares a lot about the quality his final product - your dental health! He leads a friendly and knowledgeable team who all seem super happy to work alongside him. It's a very positive, respectful environment.</Text>

<text>Unprofessional , absolutely no dental or medical knowledge of any kind . They need to know how to respect their customers , I don't think such dentist office can ever treat any patient ! , He also need to learn some medical terms and to have some better dental skills ! when I compare this dentist to any dentist I have seen and been to , I can touch the poor quality and the limited capability and the subnormal performance . Conclusion: Tho office overall need to follow some US guidelines and the dental association recommendations to establish a better customer review. they also need to learn what investigations to do and what not to do in order not to over charge and manipulate with the insurance.</text><Time>1338652949809</Time>< Pics>

<review>This is a great group of people. Dr. Qadeer and his staff made me feel at ease throughout my procedure. They have a great bedside manner and sense of humor which is very imprtant to me. I have referred several people to this dentist. While going to the dentist is never fun they make it much more tolerable.< /review>< GmapID>

I was very happy and pleased with Dr. Qadeer's work. He kept me informed every step of the way as he worked on me for crown work. I liked that very much. Patients who are informed  while the procedure is being done feel more comfortable in the chair. He was very professional and I would recommend Dr. Qadeer and Mesa Dental.< /text>

I am so glad I found Dr. Qadeer. I was staying with my Aunt in San Diego when my front veneer chipped. I couldn't bare to smile. I was so self conscious. The professional staff at Mesa Dental got me that week to fix my smile. Dr. Qadeer was so easy to work with under my time constraints. His repair was perfection! I would highly recommend Mesa Dental. They know their smiles! Mary V.<//Review>

I had the best experience with Dr Nasery. I was so scared of dentists before him. His extraordinary gentle approach has totally transformed me. He performs beautiful cosmetic dental work - my unsightly front teeth is now bright white and straight - a really natural result. Thanks to the team there you won't ever want another dentist after Dr Nasery< /Text>

I had a root canal done this morning by Dr. Qadeer. Trust me, I had no reservations, doubts nor fears because the good doctor has proven himself to be exceptional in the past. And today he easily lived up to that expectation. He and his staff are friendly and put you at ease. The doctor is gentle in his demeanor and skilled to where I don't worry about pain. This is what makes him the best family dentist!

It is always an intimidating experience to go to the Dentist, you never know what you are expecting. As a student with limited funds I decided to try Mesa Dental. I could not be more pleased with my decision. As I arrived in the office I was instantly greeted by the receptionist, and most importantly I waited less than 5 minutes to be seen!!!

Dr. Nasery and Benny were both absolutely amazing! I instantly felt comfortable and at ease with the both of them. Dr. Nasery provided me with honest and comprehensive information about the dental work that I needed. Benny made my time enjoyable at the dentist as well! FInding a good dentist is hard to come by these days. I highly recommend Mesa Dental!! :)< /Review>

<Text>I absolutely recommend Dr. Qadeer at Mesa Dental and his staff.  He is the first dentist who was able to help me overcome my fear I had due to my traumatizing past experiences at other offices.  I love the family-like atmosphere at Mesa Dental and appreciate the effort to make me feel comfortable.  Everyone is very friendly and reassuring.  Dr. Qadeer also takes care of my kids' teeth and has done a great job with them too.  He is the first dentist they actually like going to, which is quite an achievement.  We have been going to Dr. Qadeer for several years and couldn't be happier.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Resp>

They always get you in and it super fast. I've only ever had to wait once and it was because they were short staffed. Still done in less than two hours. The Dr gave me info on medicine for my fever blister when I had one and he couldn't work on me. He remembered that I hate the dryness of the gause in my mouth (gives me cringing heebie jeebies) so he limits it. We cut up and tell jokes. It's a super comfortable atmosphere. I dig them.</Text>

I rarely shill for or "Yelp" about customer service I recieve unless I had a horrible experience. Today however I am posting to recommend the best damn dentist I've ever been to and I've been to a LOT. I've always been uncomfortable/terrified of the dentist and have been trying to find one who not only does good work but is gentle and who's  customer care and staff makes me feel comfortable. Mesa Dental in San Diego is by faaaaar the best care I've EVER recieved. The staff is super friendly, they listen and care about our comfort and did a GREAT job! Dr. Qadeer and his staff are a pleasure to be around. Today i had an implant set on a broken molar. I still have more work to do and am actually looking forward to my next few visits. I HIGHLY recommend them for any dental work for anyone in the San Diego area. I really appreciate the care! Thank you for your service Doc! See ya soon! BIG up ! 😆😆😆< /review>

I went to Mesa Dental to get two crowns done on my front teeth. I was referred by a co-worker who has been going there for many years. I have been to many dentists throughout my life and I am sure that I will go nowhere else but Mesa Dental. Dr. Nasery and the staff were awesome! The crowns are perfect Dr. Nasery was so detailed and I never felt as if he was rushing, which made me feel he really cares about his patients. I can't even tell they are crowns because he did such a great job without any discomfort. Thanks Dr. Nasery!</Text>

<Text>Once you go here you will see the major difference between a good dentistry and a PERFECT one. This place is the friendliest, cleanest, professional, and the most welcoming dental office ever! My teeth feels very loved every time I come here. Wonderful teamwork and I fully trust them with my teeth and gums not being in pain because they actually care to make sure you're numb before doing anything else. Dr. Qadeer and his wonderful team (Benny & Jimmy at that time) let you signal them if anything is wrong. It is very considerate of them; you feel like your feelings matter. Unlike some offices where they want to get the job done without interferences. It's also a bonus because they also conversate back to you even when your trying to talk with your mouth open they totally understand you and will make you smile with all the great stories they tell you. They tell you procedures everytime. I have never left the office unure of the post care for any of my teeth. They listen and are very open minded to all your questions you can ask them without them making you feel bad about how you have taken care of your teeth before. They offer great solutions if any problems or worries occur. They take the time to make it a great experience for everyone and they make it very fun and thats when the time passes by very quickly. & They always tell their patience that we did a good job making it a great teamwork. I don't remember anytime where I look forward to going to my dentist appointments. I don't mind driving a little farther for this place it is so worth it. I'm so grateful for all the hard work that Dr. Qadeer and his staff has put in. The wonderful team they have established and the bond they have with each other it really feels like family. They enjoy their job so much it shows. Highly recommended to anyone that wants a perfect dentist place. I recommended this place to my best friend and she can be very hard to persuade but she really enjoys this office as well!</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I have gotten a number of treatments done with all of the doctors at Mesa Dental and I would be lying if I said I was still afraid of the dentist!  Each experience has been quite pleasant to say the least.  Who gets to lay in a massage chair with a flat screen TV inches from your face while you're getting a filling?  I have probably fallen asleep in the chair its so comfortable!  Besides everyone in the office being so professional and friendly, each person in the office genuinely goes above and beyond so that you're in and out of there in no time, which is weird because its an office you would actually want to spend more time in! lol These sweet people deserve a raise!

Now if you're a big baby like myself, lets talk about the scary pain issue.  More like lack thereof! I don't know what their secret is, but I've never, EVER felt any pain or sensitivity in ANY of my appointments.  Not even in my root canals! (Yes, root canalSSS) After the first root canal expecting the worst, I was so surprised to not feel anything! Not even the initial needle for the anesthesia! I even begged for topical for that shot and they laughed at me :( So I clenched every muscle in my body to prepare and came to realized why they laughed. They knew exactly where to poke the needle and how to slowly ease the injection in my gums.  I was so comfortable, yes, comfortable, I wanted to take the tools and add more pressure to the scraping of my roots!  I know, TMI, but I have to be thorough.  In conclusion, eating a popsicle with my two front teeth hurts me more.

Thank you Mesa Dental for everything, you rock! <3< /Review>

The entire staff is caring, compassionate, and very knowledgeable. During the procedures Dr. Qadeer explained everything that he was doing to me step by step to ensure that I understood what was going on. He also constantly checked on me to make that I wasnt feeling any pain or anything. My experiences have always been positive at Mesa Dental! Dr. Qadeer and his staff are also great with children! I bring my children to Mesa Dental whenever they have any dentistry needs. Dr. Qadeer has a passion for his work and it shows!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Wow, I'm actually beyond impressed by what Mesa dental did for my grandmother. It definitely took a long time for her treatment to finish, but Dr Qadeer had explained it that it was gonna take this long from the beginning. Ok, so I took my granma to like three different dentists, including the one that she had been going to for 17years, because her denture was loose & wiggled when she talked it was hurting her gums when she ate bread or something. Two of them told her to see a specialist cause she had no bone for the denture to hook to. Anyways, we came here cause my coworker told me to see this dentist, cause she wouldn't go anywhere else, but here for her dental work. I gotta say, we definitely made the right choice. So the dentist recommended to put these metal posts implants in her bone & then hook the denture to these & it will keep the denture really tight. Maaan,  thanks for technology. It took like 8 appointments, between the surgeon & here, but as of Friday she is seriously pretty happy. My granma is 77 years old, & I didn't know how she might take this whole treatment, but she handled it very well! Ever since she got her teeth done here I have became patient of Dr.qadeer. I really love this guy's honesty as I was told to have bunch of stuff done but I came to Him and he recommended I get one tooth done so it doesn't break! These folks are great here.</text>

Mesa Dental,, located right across from Kearny High School/Mesa college, off of Mesa College Dr, is by far one of the best dentistry I have been to thus far. My purpose of visit was for a checkup. First impressions: The receptionist was courteous and was very fast in getting my paperwork entered (since I am a new patient). Then I went on to the x-rays, took about 2 minutes, it was quick. Afterwards, I went on with the teeth cleaning and FREE teeth whitening. All of this was done within 40 minutes of my visit. Dr. Ehsan Nasery has a lot of knowledge with dentistry, and really does care about his patients. Pros: friendliness, great customer service, knowledge, and cutting edge dental technology. Cons: None! They also have another location called Cabrillo Dental, near Sharps Memorial hospital in Kearny Mesa. This place calls for a re-visit once I am due. THANK YOU MESA DENTAL STAFF, you are the BEST!<//Review>

<Review>I would have given this experience 5 stars because the sign up process was very easy, when I got to the storage location, the rep on sight, Sara, was very polite and helpful. However, the online website advertised a 1st floor unit and when I got there, Sara informed me that the unit I had reserved was on the third floor. I am pretty disappointed about this because I was comparing Extra Space and Public Storage. Both places advertised a 5 x 5, indoor, first floor units. Extra Space was actually more expensive but it was closer to my home so I went with them despite the price difference. I was pretty upset when I got to Extra Space and was told that my unit was actually on the top floor.

While this may seem like a minor detail, this is important to me because the items I will be storing in the unit are used seasonally, which means I will be in and out of the space carrying various items often. I wanted a ground unit so I could run in and run out quickly. I expressed this concern to Sara and she really tried to accommodate me.  She showed me a couple smaller spaces on the ground floor but unfortunately, there were no 5 x 5's left and anything smaller or larger wouldn't work for my needs.

Since I had already signed the lease and brought my things over, I asked her to put me on the wait list in case anyone else moved out of a 5 x 5 on the first floor. I'm not sure how the website picks this information, but I would suggest a revision because this could be a deal breaker for a lot of people and I am upset that I will be paying more for a unit that is on the top floor--it would make sense that units that are more difficult to get to would be cheaper.< /Review>< Pics>

Easy to access and no fuss.
Wish the loading bay door had more options to keep it open. The moving truck couldn’t fully fit with the lift out, forcing one person to constantly trigger the sensor.

<user_name>Angela Lawrence</user_name><time>1572805923561< /time><rating>2<//rating><Text>I picked this place because it was inexpensive and close to my apartment. I signed the paperwork and immediately knew something was wrong when the owner asked me to pull up the facility in Google Maps. She then grabbed my phone out of my hands (seriously) and left a 5-star review from my account. I laughed it off but was extremely upset by this. No wonder this place has so many 5-star reviews.vI have since deleted this review because it is so inaccurate.

Within a month, I sent them paperwork proof that I had renter's insurance so that they would waive the fee. I got no response and the next month, I was charged the insurance fee. I resent my renter's insurance and tried to call. They didn't answer my calls or reply to my emails. This went on for 3-4 months. Finally, I got a call and to their credit, they issued me a credit on my next bill. Unfortunately they could only do this in pieces because there was a maximum credit and half of it was pushed to the next month. However, I was already planning on moving out by then so I never received my full refund on the money they continued to take from me without cause.

Positives are it's clean, there's a loading dock, and they don't bother you. It's cheap too, though they'll quickly raise your monthly rate so you probably don't want to stay long. It's a decent short-term option but don't let the owner take your phone and leave a fake review! What a scam.< /Text>< pictures>

Katherine and Tasha were super helpful and worked with me to get me the best deal. They even offered a prorated charge since I won't need my stuff stored for a full 2 months. The place is really clean. They were super clear in explaining everything. The hours to access the unit go pretty late, 6am-10pm. They were the best deal I found in the area.<//Text>

During the move I have had to cut my lock due to losing my keys during the moving process. The lock that I purchased for my unit could not be cut with bolt cutters. A grinder was needed to cut my lock off. Tonia had no problem getting the power tools out and making sure that I was able to access my unit.

This place has the friendliest, most helpful staff. Noel and Catherine made the whole experience of renting a storage locker and moving our household goods in so much better-especially on a sunny, Saturday afternoon with two kids in tow. They are knowledge, fast and found a unit where we needed it after taking the time to look through their inventory. Plus, Noel offered our kids a piece of paper and pen to draw pictures after he noticed they were becoming bored and wearing on our patience.

From start to finish, the staff makes this storage location stand out from all the rest. Plus, it's super clean everywhere and nice and cool temperature  from their office to the halls where the units are located.

I wouldn't go anywhere else.<//Text>

We moved to California and needed storage and Extra Space Storage in Oakland on Market Street was recommended by our daughter.  We found the facility to be very clean and well organized, but the best part was working with Tanya, the Manager.  She was outstanding ... very helpful and supportive.
The units are reasonably priced, and there are always carts available to help with moving your items.  There is also a rear entry near the elevator which is very convenient.

Tanya made our transition to California much easier than it could have been otherwise.  Thank you for all your help.  We look forward to continuing a great relationship with Extra Space Storage and will certainly recommend this facility to friends.</text>

Glad to be vacating, but also feel like I've sort of developed an extended family. Well, granted, I have been a customer since 2009, so we've had plenty of time to develop a good working relationship and that's the reason I like this place.  They are friendly, kind and pleasant and understand the stress of having to store personal belongings. They work with you.

I was supposed to d this review a year and a half ago so I apologize to Extra Space Storage for taking so long. I found them to be excellent, clean, great pricing. visiting your locker was hassle-free and virtually unrestricted, like some places I checked out before settling on them. I'd recommend them to anyone with a storage need. We moved out of state and had a moving company pick up our stuff - no hassles whatsoever. They are good people and a great place!</text>

<review>I haven't been there long but so far it's as favorable as a storage situation can be. The set up is ideal , I appreciate the fact that I don't keep having to turn a dial for the lights to come back on because they never turn off. They gave me a great move in deal plus renting from them was as simple as getting gasoline. The staff, specifically Reggie deserves a pat on the back. He knew exactly what he was doing and how to do it correctly and his personal touch in caring about the customer is what sold me.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

This is the first Google review I've written, but I had to complement the incredible service at Extra Space Storage. My business had to send some stuff across the country for an event that we're hosting in Oakland (we're based in New York), and Katherine and Ponia went above and beyond to help find easy solutions to what should have been a logistical nightmare. Thank you, Extra Space! You rock.</Text>

I rented a unit this past week and I'm so glad I came. I went to the competitor and it was amazing how when I called it was one rate came in it was another and went on the Web for another. I passed by extra space and went in immediately  greeted with a smile and a hand shake by staff. As the staff walked me around I was amazed at the floors and the white halls. I rented a unit and the rate never changed. I'd recommend them based on just how clean it looked when you drive up. The staff closed the deal Tonya and Reggie congrats you earned my business!<//text>

This storage is the best in the bay! After driving around & calling several storage facilities, i found the perfect most affordable and cleanest property. Carla & Tanya are so nice absolutely the best & its a convenient location right off the freeway.  I got the first month free so i saved $140 which helped me a lot! I recommend this facility to anyone who needs a storage.</Text>

The facility is spotless, secure and conveniently located. The access points are well placed and there are carts staged at these points. But the absolute best feature of this facility is the management and crew who run 300 Market St. They are efficient, professional and very personable.<//text>

I signed up for an online rate at the beginning of the year that was a good deal - 2 months later, its $20 more.  Now, a few months later, I get a notice saying they are increasing my rent by $50.  What a scam.</text>

Great! First off let me tell you that I dont have a unit at this location! But I spoke with a outstanding woman named Kathryn who tried to help me! I was a lil frustrated but she still remained professional and referred me to a different facility of theirs not far from me. Hesitant I called a different storage place for prices with no luck and HIGHER prices! Kathryn then called me back to assist me on getting a unit at a close by facility with the same company! By Kathryn going above and beyond her call of duty I was able to get the unit I wanted at a great price! Customer service was A1! Thank U Kathryn!</Review>

Great! First off let me tell you that I dont have a unit at this location! But I spoke with a outstanding woman named Kathryn who tried to help me! I was a lil frustrated but she still remained professional and referred me to a different facility of theirs not far from me. Hesitant I called a different storage place for prices with no luck and HIGHER prices! Kathryn then called me back to assist me on getting a unit at a close by facility with the same company! By Kathryn going above and beyond her call of duty I was able to get the unit I wanted at a great price! Customer service was A1! Thank U Kathryn!<//Review>

The manager Katherine is very nice & professional... The reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because it's an indoor storage with 3 floors but only has 4 carts total in the whole facility which isn't enough. Sometimes people only using 1 storage unit would use 2 carts so it's difficult trying to transport your items without a cart especially if you're on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Also there are fruit flies that fly around this facility< /Text>

The staff here are rude and unfriendly unless you are a person of another race. They are not kind to other black people, especially black women. Katherine can be extremely rude when you call or ask too many questions. More recently, my husband and daughter experienced poor treatment at their facility when their stuff was being auctioned off. Unfortunately, the unit was in my name and I did not have the funds to continue paying for it and it went into default. My 18 year old daughter wanted desperately to save her baby pictures, my grandmothers old piece of clothing and personal artifacts that were truly of no high value. She went in to the auction like anyone who is part of the general public to bid legit. She was interrogated and yelled at embarrassingly in front of others and questioned and asked for her ID. Although she present ID proving she wasn't me she was still harassed and told she couldn't bid. Technically, the unit is NOT hers and NOT in her name so yes she can bid. She was outbid by another guy who was advised by staff not to work with her to get things like pictures etc. Instead, most of the stuff ended up in the trash when they guy was WILLING to give it to her. How despicable is that? There wasn't diamonds or jewelry or anything of real value, other than the stuff that makes a person cry knowing they won't ever see those baby pictures or family photos again.  The man did however turn over the cremated remains of my parents, which were dropped off at the Sheriff's office miles away instead of just calling and asking us to pick them up. My daughter even called to ask to get them and the phone was slammed in her face. I had to call corporate to get the address of where they were located. Its so sad when people lose compassion and care for others especially when they don't OWN Extra Space...they are just employees. Why do your own kind wrong? Why not show love instead of hate or disdain? You do not know anyone else's situation. Do not make assumptions without know a person. These ladies determined we weren't worthy of those items because we didn't have the money and they interfered in a situation where the buyer of the unit was WILLING to give most of the items back. He took a loss on the purchase of that unit and all they gave a damn about was the bottom line. In a nutshell, this location is biased and unfortunately discriminatory against certain people. Now there are a good portion of you out there that don't know about black on black racial biases, but they exist more often than not. This is the case at this location. People will still use them, I know, but black people take your dollars elsewhere. Places like this prey on the poor and those who are down on their luck. They have introductory rates, then raise the rent when they want. KEEP YOUR BUSINESS GO ELSEWHERE!!</Review>

I was renting a unit there for 8 months, after 5 months thay charged me more money from my credit card. I called to ask why, they said that they have more demands so they raising the price.
I asked to speak with a Manger but he never called me back.

<user_name>Jazz Jacobs</user_name><Text>My friend reserved a unit and received a call back within minutes from LaTanya. We were greeted with warm smiles from two ladies upon entering the office. LaTanya showed my friend his unit and I chose to wait in the office with Karla. My friend shortly returned and within minutes he was done and ready to move in. They also had a variety of things needed of supplies to complete our move. Great spirits, facility was clean, we felt safe, just overall, their customer service was great. I told Karla that if I ever needed storage for myself I would come back and rent with them. I recommend this facility.</Text>< Response>

< Review>
Hey, I was stuck!  My storage was full, my van was overloaded and my cash was short.  I needed an immediate solution.  I had been a customer of Extra Space Storage for over a year, but it wasn't until I was pressed to the wall, that I sought the advise of the employees, for assistance with my storage problem.  After a short discussion with Mr. Davis and Ms. Bennett, the solution that was best for me was revealed and implemented.  I am more than pleased with the service that I received at Extra Space Storage.  Sincerely, Professor Curtis, O.G.</Review>

<review>Five years ago this facility was nice. Now it looks as sad as any beat up place. The rollup doors on the north side are functional about half the time. The north elevator has had a broken call button for more than six months. During my past three visits I cannot find a cart for use. Not because they are in use, there are no carts. Perhaps people are stealing them, but closing your eyes to a problem is not the solution.

I would not recommend this facility to anyone.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I was looking for a storage in a rushed situation. I went to two locations up the street from each other. However once i walked into extra space i knew it was the one. As soon as  i  walked in i was greeted by Tonya who i later found out was the manager. She showed me some units and as we walked and talked i felt more and more comfortable with this location. Its clean clean clean and from what i can see very secure. What got me was the service. It was great. She even gave me an extra space mug.  IM GLAD I STOPPED IN. WHO WALKS YOU TO THE DOOR NOW A DAYS? Obviously extra space employees. At the end i asked her who can i write or call to let them know about her impeccable customer service and she said. Aww dont worry about it ITS apart of my job! Wow customer for life!<//Review>

After having a not so good impression of another storage company in Oakland, LaTanya' at Extra Space Storage saved us! Seriously, it was an awful day (having just drove 12 hours from San Diego) and LaTanya's professionalism and patience made everything better.

LaTanya' was not only friendly but was also very knowledgeable about Extra Space Storage's available units and prices. She was able to get us a great deal and worked with us to find a unit easy accessible to our moving truck.

It's crazy how one employee can make or break a deal. She made a customer for life and I will be referring Extra Space Storage to any one I know who needs help in the future. Extra Space Storage is lucky to have LaTanya.

Thank you again!</text>

<Review>I have been using Extra Space Storage off and on since 2008. My experience overall has been great. My reason for giving this particular location an "excellent " rating is simply due to the increased quality of costumer service and attention to detail about my needs. I am really working to get all of my items out of storage, however while I am working on that the staff, always greats my with a friendly greeting and are quick to get handle what my needs may be.
What finally lead me to write a review after all this time with extra space storage is attention to detail and awesome customer service provided to me by, the site manager LaTanya Bennett and Kathrine Weitherspoon, the assistant manager.
As many may know who have rented at this site for any long period of time, the merry-go-round of managerial changes has been quite frequent.
However, these two managers have done something no other manager has done for me, and that is look to save me money while also giving me the storage space I need. After a review of my account they were able to show me how I could achieve my storage goals while saving money at the same time. I have been well vested in Extra Space Storage for quite some time. And out of neccessity, have dealt with the cost, but not happy at all about what I had to incur for this amount of time. Yes, I was affected by the Real Estate market.
Nevertheless, I am taking this time out of my schedule to inform others. If you do need a storage facility, I would highly recommend this location.
Pro's- Informed Staff,Safe Location,Clean,Awesome internet deals
Con's- None, I have personally experienced(and I have no reason to be biased I am paying them they are not paying me :-) )<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I have been using Extra Space Storage off and on since 2008. My experience overall has been great. My reason for giving this particular location an "excellent " rating is simply due to the increased quality of costumer service and attention to detail about my needs. I am really working to get all of my items out of storage, however while I am working on that the staff, always greats my with a friendly greeting and are quick to get handle what my needs may be.
What finally lead me to write a review after all this time with extra space storage is attention to detail and awesome customer service provided to me by, the site manager LaTanya Bennett and Kathrine Weitherspoon, the assistant manager.
As many may know who have rented at this site for any long period of time, the merry-go-round of managerial changes has been quite frequent.
However, these two managers have done something no other manager has done for me, and that is look to save me money while also giving me the storage space I need. After a review of my account they were able to show me how I could achieve my storage goals while saving money at the same time. I have been well vested in Extra Space Storage for quite some time. And out of neccessity, have dealt with the cost, but not happy at all about what I had to incur for this amount of time. Yes, I was affected by the Real Estate market.
Nevertheless, I am taking this time out of my schedule to inform others. If you do need a storage facility, I would highly recommend this location.
Pro's- Informed Staff,Safe Location,Clean,Awesome internet deals
Con's- None, I have personally experienced(and I have no reason to be biased I am paying them they are not paying me :-) )</review>< rating>

<text>Five years ago this facility was nice. Now it looks as sad as any beat up place. The rollup doors on the north side are functional about half the time. The north elevator has had a broken call button for more than six months. During my past three visits I cannot find a cart for use. Not because they are in use, there are no carts. Perhaps people are stealing them, but closing your eyes to a problem is not the solution.

I would not recommend this facility to anyone.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808f80bc1af3903b:0x9d4694dd8a68d356</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
