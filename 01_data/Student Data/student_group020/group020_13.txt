First off, what a great team Dr Stratford has assembled.
Drop your worries at the door. The entire team is so welcoming and professional. I had peace of mind that I'd come to the right place right away.

Thank you so much.<//review>

I am extremely frustrated with this dentist. I chose this dentist because they are contracted with my insurance. I was very clear from the beginning that I wanted to have my wisdom teeth checked out because I thought they needed to be extracted. It wasn't until the DDS (who was not Jeffrey A. Stratford-Jones DDS; I, in fact, never saw him during my three visits to the practice) came to examine me at the end of my first appointment that I found out that they don't actually extract teeth there! I would have chosen another dentist who could extract teeth. I felt like this behavior was extremely misleading and was purposeful so they could perform procedures and collect fees without actually addressing the root cause of my issues. Furthermore, during my third appointment, the DDS and assistant were talking about a patient they had referred for extraction and the DDS caused the tooth to break apart causing the patient extreme pain. Why would I see a dentist they recommend after that story?! My first appointment for cleaning was also miserable. The hygienist was extremely rude. She told me that I would have to get braces and, even after telling her multiple times that I would not get braces, she kept insisting that was the only treatment plan. She also kept telling me that I had gum loss and was making it seem like my teeth were falling out. Only later did she mention that my gums were actually within normal range. I had to request that she would not treat me during my second and third appointments. My second and third appointments were fine and I appreciate being checked in on after the procedures. My real frustration comes from their billing practices and the rudeness of the Office Manager Krista. The first EOB I received for cleaning said that I owed almost $200. After emailing Krista she told me that they write off those charges. I should have been informed that was the case before I received an EOB. Krista did let me know that each of the two subsequent procedures I needed would cost $156. I was not informed that some charges wouldn't be sent to my insurance so the EOB would say I only owed $46 when in reality I actually did owe $156 per procedure. I emailed Krista and she said that I would get a refund after my insurance paid. After I emailed again she said there would be no refund. She then became extremely rude and said that I signed the treatment plan so I should have known that they wouldn't even bother to bill my insurance for some charges. I would be less upset if she hadn't been so rude in recent emails and if she had actually explained all of the charges to me. I will never go back to this dentist.</text>

<text>I recently joined this dentistry as my old dentist retired and I've had an excellent experience so far. I've not met Jeffrey and was attended to by one of his colleagues (a young Colombian lady) and she has been excellent, x2 fillings and a crown done quickly and efficiently / no waiting around / they attend to you at your appointment time and I particularly enjoyed their technology of viewing all of my teeth on camera (first time I've seen them so clearly). I look forward to many more years with this practice.< /text>< Response>

An overdue review. The hygienist I had was really thorough and nice... one star for her. But Laurie (I believe that was her name), the woman at the front desk, had signed me up for CareCredit without my informed consent. I needed treatment, and she said I could do a payment plan. She said she can check to see if I would be approved. I thought "check" meant, truly to check, with no long term commitment... and payment plan, as in, through their office. Laurie ended up signing me up for a credit card. I don't open many credit cards, so when I found this out after she clicked enter, I was furious. I said, "i don't want to open a credit card"... And she stared at me blankly like, "uh... I already did". So I had no choice but to sign the contract for CareCredit. I immediately cancelled the card when I got home, but doing so affected my credit score. Now whenever I check my FICO and look under "closed accounts" and "hard inquiries", I see CareCredit and think of the misinformation by Laurie. Thanks...< /text>

< Review>
Our family has been with Dr Jones for over 20 years.  Going to the dentist is never a fun experience.  But with Dr. Stratford-Jones, we really get the best dental care possible.  The staff is knowledgeable, kind, friendly, and experienced.  And Dr. Jones  is really the as good as it gets.   He never pushes his opinion, but counsels and explains clearly so I get to make the best (guided) decision for my own mouth.  His work is gentle and precise.  I have even now convinced my Mom to come see him, because he is just that good.< /Review>

Also, all the services done up to this point were great and I had no problems.

This samesame c had come off 2 times in 2 years that the Dr. needed to re-attach it. First time, no biggie and no issues with payment, as  It was no charge (as expected). Second time, I was told there would be no charge just like the first time... But they charged me and my insurance anyways for this visit. This was not good. I was livid and refused to pay and was sent to collections. It was not right to have to pay for a defect. The never made this right.

I just payed the $156 collection from that second visit about 2 weeks ago, so it would be removed from my credit report.

This same crown just came off today for a THIRD TIME.  Long story short, my crown was junk (crown was very short and had very little surface area to adhere to my tooth, also the porcelain was chipping off the metal below).

I've just paid $900 to have a new crown made. Dr took down the tooth and the gum to make sure this crown is done right.

I'm not mad anymore, really just disappointed this office never reached out to make this right. But.. I'm glad that my new dentist is fixing the root of the problem today.

Note: A new review will be coming for this new business I'm using now, when my new crown is on in 3 weeks.</Text>< pics>

<text>This is the most thorough dental exam I have ever had. Dr. Stratford-Jones explained in details all of the issues of my teeth and gave solutions. The hygiene technician, Connie if I spell it correctly, worked very carefully to clean up some stains on my teeth. At some points I guess she fully focused on cleaning the teeth and forgot to suck the water in my mouth, let some of the water run out to my neck :).</text><Gmap_id>0x80e93ff516ba1d93:0x41f8662139a12ef6<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

My experience at Jeffrey A. Stratford-Jones was very pleasant.  The staff are always welcoming, and the procedure is relatively painless.  I would recommend this office to all my friends.</text>

Didn't have to wait long. Friendly, knowledgeable, competent staff.
Made sure I was comfortable.
Took enough time, but not forever.
I'll be back!< /Text>

Love all of the staff that do the real hands on services, they are very genuine and compassionate people. Whatever is getting performed on you dentally is always efficient and easy to sit through. No complaints on my behalf as far as that is concerned. However, the lady with a southern accent who just sits at the computer all day is extremely rude and will really throw your day off with immense amounts of attitude. To be so disrespectful with considerably the easiest job in there is just beyond me. Not to mention, she is the first person who you speak with upon entry so she may very well taint your experience heavily upon arrival. It is almost as if she forgets that is clients are paying her bills, now due solely to this  broad's ignorance I will be moving to a new dentist after going here 15 years.<//text>

Dr. Stratford Jones and his team are knowledgeable, friendly and as much fun as you can have at the dentist. 😀 I always feel that I'm presented with objective and helpful information and I never feel that I'm being sold products or dental procedures that aren't necessary, unlike some previous dentists I've had.  I've been a patient of Dr. Stratford Jones and his team for several years and I give them my highest recommendation.<//text>

<Text>This is the pier where my father died On February 02, 1992. I Only go around here If I am need to talk to my dad. Much of the people around their are ether not friendly. or hate my family. it's not like it was back in the early 90s where you can just drive down, at night and smell the rotten egg stench. You still get that but that is just this part of the bay.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Kaylee Stein<//name>< rate>

<text>The yard had space for trucks staying there during shows and I usually have the opportunity to collect some nice sea glass and rocks down by the water whenever we're here. Just don't go out during high tide, no telling what might be swimming around at that time. I've seen a shark tooth out there before and I wish I'd grabbed it. All that aside its a good place out here in my opinion.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808f7fa1ef760889:0x54b71e4a20978533< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I had to take a security shuttle from the pier to the gate, but I didn't expect any kindness, but it was quite unfriendly. It is good that the traffic around is not bad.

부두에서 게이트까지 시큐리티의 셔틀을 타고 이동해야하는데 친절을 기대한건 아니었지만, 상당히 불친절하네요. 주변 교통이 나쁘지 않은 점은 좋습니다.<//Review></record>

Really good beers! Lots of choices and friendly staff. They have games to play and even a space for private events. They do not offer food that I noticed. They have a very cool wall filled with different beers! Clean bathrooms and air conditioning from a large portable system.</Text>

It is with a heavy heart I give Rip Current a 3 star. The beer is 5 stars all day long, but the brewery has not adapted well to the Covid restrictions. Food is required to drink on site and instead of getting a food truck like most other breweries your only option is a slice of pizza, either pepperoni or cheese. The pizza was horrible, the crust was like cardboard. I should have just thrown my money in the garbage. 1 star for the pizza, 5 stars for the beer. If you are visiting during the covid restrictions just be prepared to pay a premium fee and toss the pizza out. When the covid restrictions lift or when they get an actual food truck the rating will be 5 stars for sure.</Review>

<review>Not a fan of the location of the dart board but can't fault them for anything else.  Booze was good service was nice and they had something other than ipa's.  Bathroom was not only cleaned and fresh but also composed of a beer keg.  Hilarious hijinks ensue as each member of the party goes to check.</review>< date>

The GABF winner Rip Current offers an incredible variety of beers, from the award winning Breakline Bock to an array of darker beers and IPA’s. The tasting room offers a wall of old beer cans amongst surf themed decorations, all in a good sized area. Great staff and an easy location right off of hops highway makes it a must visit!< /text>

Great local spot, very friendly relaxed atmosphere. Truly decent beer.
Edit I did rate this place five stars but now I can only give it two. Starting near the beginning of 2020 there was a noticeable change in the flavor and quality of beer. The two things I ask myself when I am at a brewery are: 1 would I like to drink this beer? And 2 would I like to drink this beer here. Unfortunately my answer to both is, no. I used to be greeted with a smile but those days are far gone. I walked into the San Marcos location the other day and there was a kid behind the bar on his phone. He half looked up at me then went back to his phone. He acted entitled like he was the owners son or a brewer who's job wasn't dealing with customers or something. I stood at the bar for a while looking for some eye contact but no one appeared. I just walked out without ordering. I still stop in every now and then after work but the beer is so bad. Lupulin Lust was the only solid beer and it now tastes so bad I do not enjoy drinking it. I have tried to power it down but it is work now. Low quality beer, low quality employees. Do not go here.<//text>

I came on a Saturday around 5pm in a group of 4. We had no problem finding a table at that time. Nice selection! The 4 of us with varying tastes were all able to find at least a couple beers we liked.

Favorite Beers:
- Java Storm: My favorite! Now in my top 3 for dark beers. If you like stouts/porters with a strong coffee profile you will love this. It wasn't as bitter as I expected with it having "Imperial" in the name.
- Take Off Triple: I normally don't like triples, but this was excellent.
- SD-Style Hefeweizen: Very nice! Fruity.< /review>

<Text>Superb microbrewery... Great beers across a wide range of styles, usually 15+ available.  The surf themed decor and the wall of cans are nice bonus treats.  Friendly service  with plenty of swag for sale.  A "must-do" for North County breweries.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
This has been one our favorite local breweries for many years. Kind of small, but always welcoming and cozy. Many great beers, especially IPAs. Lupulin Lust and Off The Lip are my favs. They also make one of the best  Porters ever: Vanilla Storm. It's not always available though.< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>So excited to find Kolsch and I ordered a pint before trying a taster--mistake; tasted like cardboard. The Bock was better and drinkable, but the Alt was off.
The bar was sticky, the service slow & indifferent, and there were half-finished glasses littering the bar. At the end of the night, I'd left a few too. There are a few really great breweries in Vista, but Rip Current is not one of them. Yet.
Will check back again in a few weeks; hopefully it was just a few unlucky batches and one of the barkeeps called in sick.</review><rating>2</rating><Gmap_id>0x80dc75419f6a3a31:0x89e3538cfbc8937e<//Gmap_id><resp>None</resp></record>

I went today after work to get food and the old lady had her mask down put it on and looked at us with a mad face didn’t great us and started talking to us in a rude way I asked her what I wanted and she gave it to me. When we payed we where almost out the door when an American man walked in a she greeted him and asked him what he wanted in a really happy tone of voice!? I couldn’t believe how she treats different customers according to their ethnicity, never going back again and don’t recommend this place to us Latinos.<//review>

<review>This was awesome before the new owner came in. The past owner gave me and my co workers great potions and the food was fresh. This new couple that’s running the place now serve you like you’re stealing from them. I can’t believe the way I’m being treated now, I miss this place bc even though the environment around was terrible it’s very clean inside but I’m giving up on the hope that the new owner would be generous as the old ones were.< /review><user_id>117044594670876469290<//user_id><rate>3< /rate><pics>None</pics>< Time>

<Review>I have tried eating here multiple times and every single time I am disappointed. The 1st time I ate there I had the beef and broccoli, it felt like there was dirt in the broccoli.. The soda machine is always perfect though.<//Review>< pictures>

My husband had previously used Big rig collision and when I was hit by another car he decided this was the place he wanted to use for that repair. I can say when I picked up my R350 it looked great I would even say it looked better than before. I am very grateful for Jose he is very kind and helpful. Thank You for the wonderful job you did on my MB. I fell in love with it all over again thanks to your amazing work.< /review>

<Text>My vehicle was terribly rear-ended. They helped fixed my car internally and externally. This was the first time I have gone to their shop and outstanding service. Jose, was communicative and understanding. He answered my phone calls all the time and always answered my questions. His communication was also easy because he answered through text messages too. I felt comfortable and peace of mind that he had my car at the shop.  He did his 100% best to get the necessary parts for my vehicle. Helpful with the towing too. I recommend you guys to check them out.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

10/10 experience. Took my car for some body work and a full paint job and needless to say the end result was absolutely stunning! I didn't even recognize the car when I pulled into the lot. The quality of the work is amazing and so is the service. They answered all my questions, & eased all my concerns. If you're planning on having work done, Big Rig is definitely the place to go to!</Review>

Brought my Freightliner Semi here for repairs after my fuel tank was demolished by a hit & run driver.....

This team was smooth to communicate with.....

They returned my calls the same day (which is so important)

And, stayed focused despite us being in a Pandemic.

Give this place a call, just talk to them and fell them out..... and you will leave satisfied.< /Review>< Pictures>

I am beyond happy with all the amazing help Jose did for me and for my car when I needed them the most! They took ownership of my vehicle and were so very helpful and kind through the whole process of me leaving my vehicle to be repaired, they provided so amazing customer service they care!! It’s a beautiful feeling of peace knowing they cared and were there to help me! I got my car back and it looked BRAND NEW!!!! drove amazing!!!! I was so amazed to see the work they did but God Knew they were the Ones who were going to be able to fix my car in a timely manner with loving and motivated workers! If anyone needs to choose a repair collision center I recommend Big Rig Collision Center! I am so sure 100 percent they will not let you down and you will be amazed in the work they do for you and how we are valued by them! Thank you again Big Rig Collision Center and Jose for his amazing patience with me as well!! And thank you Dan for all you did for me as well!! God bless you!!!!  :)</review>

< review>
2019: So I came back a couple years later to get a full service paint job on both the car and motorcycle. These guys take great pride in their work and customer service. They kept me updated with changes along the way and accommodated requests I had. Their attention to detail is second to none. They are a creative team where each member contributes creative ideas for the overall customized look. I'll be going back for other body work and painting needs as necessary. They are trustworthy, sensitive to customer's budget, and all about producing a product that they are proud of.

2017: OUTSTANDING doesn't even begin to describe the quality and customer service. They care about their work and how the customers will feel once the work is completed. Always aiming to please. 100 STARS all the way! Can't wait to get back there for next service! A+<//review>

<Time>1598064448816<//Time><username>daviro1158<//username><Review>I had lots of rust on the roof rails of my 2007 Frontier. The first place that I got a repair quote from wanted to cut the entire roof off and replace it. I went to Jose and he said that was not what I needed. Jose and his crew did a beautiful job removing all the rust and painted the roof, and the price was less than half of the first shop. Looks better than when it was new. Also they went above and beyond touching up chips and small scratches. Also, they polished the original paint. Needless to say that when I saw my truck I was overly impressed with the quality of work that was done. Big Rig Collision is now my "GoTo" place. I give them a 10 out of 10 stars.<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>Jose!! He did a terrific job on my car! I wanted to wait a few weeks to write my review to see how my car was running and everything is working better than before. You can not tell my car was in a bad accident. The only downside I had during my experience is that it took a little longer than expected but as soon as Jose realized the job was going to take longer, he payed for a rental car until they finished mine. So sweet! Thank you Jose and to your team for doing your best on my car!!</review>< Date>

<Text>A visit to a body shop, any body shop, is probably not going to be the most pleasant of experiences.  Visiting a shop most likely means your vehicle was involved in accident, and something like this is certainly not going to put you in the best of moods.

However, Danny and Jose and his team at Big Rig Collision helped to make the entire "ordeal" as easy and as painless as possible for me.

I initially showed without an appointment.  I showed up because I wanted to MAKE an appointment, for an estimate.  Danny was able to give me an estimate on the spot.  While I was there, he gave me a small tour, which included pointing out his 70-year-old father who was working in the shop at the time!  Danny, literally, "grew up" around cars and body shops!

From what I've since learned, matching a vehicle's color is not an exact science.  It's not as if you can pick out that exact color from the paint store down the street.  Instead, matching a color involves starting with a similar base and mixing colors until you have a match.

This was Number One on my small list of worries.  It turns out I was worried for nothing.  Danny and his team were able to match the color PERFECTLY.  They did a GREAT JOB with my car!  There is no sign it was ever involved in an accident.  It looks FANTASTIC!

While they were working on it, they kept me up-to-date on the car's progress.  In all, they DID have my car for about ten days... but looking at the finished product makes it all worthwhile.  Getting the job done correctly, the first time, is what's most important.  (And in Danny's defense, he was gone on vacation for most of that time, meaning his shop was short-staffed while he was gone.)

I don't have a problem in recommending Big Rig Collision.  I'm very happy with my entire experience with them.  I hope they are still around if I ever need their services again.  - Edward Collins</Text></record>

Where do I begin.  Jose saved my life. I was involved in an accident and unable to driver my car. I was refereed to Big Rig Collision by my mechanic Steve at Your car specialist. Steve said to ask for Jose and he will take care of you. I called and it was that simple. I was taken care of.  I had my car towed there and after losing the fight with my insurance company I was forced to pay out of pocket for these repairs. Jose fixed my car beautifully and helped me with my tight budget. I am forever grateful to Jose and Big Rig collision and would refer them 100 times over. THANK YOU JOSE! God Bless.</text>

Jose and his crew are the best! When I was in my accident about a year and half ago. I was really upset about my accident, and when I came in I spoke to Jose and he made me feel at ease. I left knowing my vehicle will be in good hands. Once soon as it was done, I went down to his shop and when I saw my car it was like nothing ever happened! I'm thankful for the work he and his people do! I would recommend them to anyone, family and friends.</review>

Is it ever fun to have your car in the shop?  No - so many things to deal with:  insurance, scheduling when you have time to leave it, arranging a rental car, etc.  But I am here to tell you that Big Rig Collision Center not only never disappoints, but always exceeds every expectation you could possibly have!<//Text>

I was rear ended on the freeway with about $7000 in damage. I have AAA. But because of Big Rig’s reputation, they had no problem approving them to fix my car. And I recently messed my side with mirror and had to take it back in. They had a  really nice tow truck in there that looked brand new!  It was beautiful!  They work on all sizes of trucks too!  I just can’t say enough about these guys!!< /text>

I am extremely grateful for Jose and the entire team at Big Rig Collision Center.  They helped and informed me to an extensive level of how the insurance companies operated when you filing a claim. I was referred though a friend to trust them with my vehicle being repaired and I could not be any more satisfied with the work and quality but most importantly with their customer service. Thank you for going above and beyond, I appreciate you all.< /Review>

Big Rig Collision Center deserves 100 Gold Stars, absolutely the bet customer service I have ever had,  I brought my wife's 2006 Toyota Camry after being rear ended. My wife has a lot of sentimental value with this car and the owners Danny and Jose went above and way beyond what I was expecting. Her car came out like it was being delivered to a dealership!!!  it was so shinny and not a hair of a scratch on it! the reflection that was coming off the car put me in AWE!  The job they did was truly amazing, Plus they detailed and shampoo the inside for you. It was an amazing job well done!

After talking with Jose and Danny I realized right away they are true and honest owners and they show pride in their craft. Danny and Jose  each have over 40 years of experience in making cars looking brand new. If your looking for honesty and a shop that will take care of your car like it was their own head to BRCC they are EXCELENCE  and I will never again go anywhere else.
Thank you Danny and Jose!</text>

Danny and Jose (the owners) were awesome. My car was damaged while I was at work. The hood wouldn't close at all and the alarm was not working. They took 30 min of their time, stopped what they were doing and fixed my car for free! For sure very honest people. I would recommend Big Rig Collision to everyone!< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>So, I’ve never been in any kind of accident before, thank goodness but recently I caught someone hitting my car with their car door in my school parking lot. Turns out these people were very nice and apologetic. The husband of the family referred me to a local body shop he knew of personally. From the moment I walked in and met Danny, I felt at ease. He was so down to earth and a natural at making genuine human connections. It was so refreshing to be treated like that instead of just another business transaction. Everything went smoothly and Danny made sure to answer all my questions and concerns. Finally the day I went to pick up my vehicle I noticed it was not only fixed perfectly (with my husbands tough and surprising APPROVAL) but also, a lot cleaner than how I left it. Ok, by clean I mean super clean inside and out (even the engine). I was flabbergasted when Danny explained that the shop always details their customers cars after work has been done to it. He explained that as an owner he was looking for a way to wow his customers so that they would remember their experience with BIG RIG Collision. Well, I was very wowed. Mind you I’m just a poor humble student who has no job so I didn’t have much money in my wallet. I reached in for a $20 and tried to give it to Danny for a tip so he could buy lunch on me. It was the least that I could do after they had been so kind to me at the shop. To my surprise again, Danny refused to take my tip and called over the other owner of the shop, Jose. Jose came over to greet me and along with Danny smiled and just asked that I put in a good word for them if I ever met someone in need of their services. I would recommend these awesome guys to anyone with full confidence that you would have the same experience as mine. A+ customer service all the way! I rarely go on line to write reviews but, no doubt this company “wowed” me all the way!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

No matter what your contract said, they close food before the time, even when you paid for your bartender he close at 11pm when your party its until 12pm. Cake it's not fully served the amount it's so poor  they keep most of it and coffee it's served in  very small foam cups. So be prepared to take your own cooler  and prepaid food with warmers and coffee table for after 11 so, your guest can have something to drink, but the worst part it's security team they demostrated not education, bad manners they rude with guest, when you want to talk with owner he is not available until next day, personal discussed with guest before than you. And be awared they count not for amount of people you have paid they count for tables so, if you have a table wit 2 or 3 empty chairs and you got 1 more extra table even if you need 30 or 40 people more to complete your contract your going to be charged with 300 dls more  per table otherwise securities got your guest out with any advise to you not asking to you if you available to pay the extra, they count honor table as 12 people too that's crazy  And next day owner said his cameras show different things🙄 other wise very elegant  and nice place food excellent and elegant presented. It's a shame they don't respect schedule for food, bartender, and they treat you like they doing you a favor when that food its fully paided  just live it no matter if not waitter serving. yes maybe I'll will get it again if price it's not so expensive but taking my own cooler coffee machine otherwise taking my own decent coffee cups, and extra warm food containers from outside, and checking they follow contract rules. One more thing the photographer they provide it's not a compromise to get it, your party will look very poor if your getting money from your guest for pics. And the pic theyll give you for this too small don't get it. I feel bad because place its  really nice but owner need to listen people taking care of his bussiness</text>

So first all I would like to give a huge thank you to platinum banquet and their team. I am very happy how everything turned out.
So my sister's quinceanera was this last Saturday. They let us enter the hall at 10 am to prep everything that we needed to do. Like the candy bar the decorations and also the photographer was able to check the dvd player and we had no problems at all. My sister was also able to practice before the actuall dance so that was great.
I met the manger who in charge and he explained everything. Mind you my parents don't speak Spanish so I had to translate. But he explained that 10 mins before they open the buffet they would feed the quinceanera and the crew. Which was so fancy i actually loved it. And we talked about the timing of cutting the cake and the passing for the toast and ECT. He was so helpful. We didn't have plates for the candy bar and he was so nice to give us some. And when I had questions he was always nice about anwsering even if I asked twice. Also the security guard introduce himself and basically explained what his job indicated like the list and If there were to be a problem he would first come to me then if the problem wasn't resolved then he would take furher action. But there was no problems at all. So they were both very helpful and both very nice people. Also the servers were great. Every time I asked for something they would answer and just do what I would ask. Very nice people too. Very please with the management and their team all so helpful with great attitudes.
Now the food was okay. I personally liked it some dishes were good others were not. My family was not a fan. But I think as Latinos were not used to the type of food they provide But like I said they had many options some dishes were great others were not but the food was worth paying for less stress to worry about. Also what banquet halls provide great food. Lmk because I been to many and they all seem the same.  Also they provide chips with salsa, fruits as well. And now for the beer. I was so happy knowing we were able to bring as much as we wanted. And we were not charge for extra. We had the option of a open bar but we kept it simple so I am very please with that as well. Overall i was very happy with everything I would definitely recommend this hall to you and my friends to my family.  If you decided to book this hall please book in advance even a year in advance. We were planning for the summer but there were no more openings. We also thought no one would show up because of the timing but everyone showed up.
Also so y'all know the cost of the party. We had 300 guest. It included food, drinks, cake, fruit and the photographer which you had to pay for the pictures. But many people bought which was nice because they had a memory to take home. It didn't bother me at all. It was their hustle you have to respect that. But overall it was about 10 grand. But it is all different depending on the timing also how many guesy so just call and ask for an estimate. I also loved the fact that the owner was chill about the payments he allowed us to pay the the last payment a day before the party and he wasn't rude about it. And he was also very helpful and nice about everything. We will be booking the place in the future. And So once again thank you for everything. Less stress. Once it hits 12 am we picked up our last belongings. The banda was also picking up there things. No one rushed us.
I am so happy with everything!!!! Thank you again</text>

The employees kicked us of the table. They would hurry us up to eat and the food was really cold. They rolled there eyes and would make faces at us. They called security for no reason. Very bad but the place was pretty<//text>

<Text>It's never a good sign, when the doorman isn't: checking for weapons with a metal detector (or checking i.d.'s) at the entry point. If you don't get screened, save yourself the trouble and do an about face.
When an organization does that, is because they are so desperate to get at least 1 client in their Club.
Which at it's core, the root cause, means they have poor service, or something is being done wrong. It's an indication that the staff is scaring off customers. I didn't trust my gut, and I went inside. And it's a rough sit.
The only comparison, that closely resembles being inside Skin's, the only way I can describe the experience inside too, is like being surrounded by homeless. They ask for money, and then get MAD when you don't give them anything, for DOING nothing???
Skin's will remain a ghost town establishment, until the staff visits, and picks up a few lessons, on how different Club's run their operation. But don't trust my word for it, go on in, and see for yourself. I bet you, you won't last an hour..</Text><user_name>Amy J. Delevingne<//user_name>< rating>

<Text>Clean, professional looking place. There’s a $15 cover and $10 minimum non-alcoholic drink price to get in, then sporadically get dancers to get on their single pole dance floor and move a little. Don’t expect full nude each time, and don’t expect good pole dancing. Overpriced lap dances, mediocre music, and in the middle of nowhere. Might be better on different nights, but this time was terrible.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Called before auditioning. Guy told me that he didn’t even remember speaking to me and that they weren’t holding auditions, asked to use WiFi so I can Uber back and no one cared to help and was super rude so I had to walk somewhere else to use WiFi (yay, a small girl like me walking around alone!)I never have been treated like this anywhere. It would be better with different management 🤭< /Review>

This is the most upscale club in LA. Very good diversity of talent, not like other clubs that have too many ghetto girls.  Lap dances can be pricey, but what do you expect its a strip club. It's like an arcade when I was a kid, now I am an adult and the more I spend the more fun I have. Who says money can't buy you happiness???<//Review>

Fun place!  Nice setup with a central stage and comfy chairs plus VIP seating as well.  Not a huge venue but just about the right size to sit between cramped and big enough that you need multiple stages (and then have to split attention.)

Couple things to note: this club is FULL nude ... and accordingly a dry 'bar' so no alcohol or byob. $15 cover (they had free-cover cards on the tabled) plus $6 sodas up thru $20 sparking water are available and there's a one-drink minimum.  Dances are topless ($30) or nude ($40)...and couch or bed (+$) and a bit pricey as typical for a full nude club.  What you don't spend on overpriced, watered down drinks they make up on dances.

Monday was pretty quiet but they still had a nice selection of girls which were mostly in their 20s.  All of them were attractive, one or two extremely so (in my opinion at least).  As it was slow, they were a extra friendly and chatty.  Since they don't sell booze all the money comes from dances - so expect a hard sell.  One girl (who's name escapes me) was extremely cute and had some awesome pole dancing tricks too.  I'll miss her!

Security was unobtrusive - no metal detectors or burly bouncers intimidating you for no reason like some other places have. Valet parking is $7 and I didn't notice any street parking nearby. DJ playing a decent mix of music with a number of 90s throwbacks thrown in too.

Overall a great place you should definitely visit if you want dances but since its dry you may want to party elsewhere first.  Since they're open till 4am, you can totally hit them up when the normal bars start shutting down.<//Text>

The hidden prices are $7 for valet parking which is the only parking Within a block or 2 available. It's a $15 cover fee after 6:00 p.m., But there is a hidden mandatory one drink purchase for a minimum of $10.   A gentlemans club being shady, who would have thought?</Text>

I have little use for a sex shop, but we saw the museum on tv, and thought "sure!" It was neat. Some of the older ones were really creepy and painful looking. The 50s - 60s models were all scifi/vaccuum looking. It was groovy. I dug the display of home modified vibes. Homer Simpson Skin Gentlemen's Lounge: niiiice! All in all, the Vaccuum Museum in Los Angeles is cooler.</Text>

<review>This place has porn stars! I stopped by this place last weekend with a bunch of friends around 1am and I'm not sure if it was just a lucky night for us but this place was rocking. All kinds of girls. There was some ugly ones and the price is not for the cheap but there were definately some hotties worth my hard earned dollar. Had no idea this place was open till 4am. Definately a place worth checking out for some late night fun. ;)< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b980f80aa78b:0x2be245a29a4e22fa</gmap_id>< Rating>

Great napa store, largest one in the area. They have lots of stuff in stock that most others don't carry. Friendly knowledgeable staff. It's the only parts store I'll use when I'm in the area so yes I absolutely recommend these folks.<//Text>

This particular Napa went from being the best place to being the worst. They have literally not honored their battery warranties, won't accept batteries for core charges even though they say they will, and just straight up are unethical, and unhelpful now. It's sad.</Review>

Has anyone else realized that this Napa has turned into a complete joke? They used to be the best, but now they refuse to warranty batteries, and they just have literally zero idea what they're talking about. I'm done<//text>

<review>Sadly a really good customer service turned horrible
Larry did a great job finding something for me and had it shuttled over same day.
He did not know the policy that I was supposed to pay for it first.
After several calls the item was not in when it was supposed to arrive
Cody answered each time and could not locate it. He explained that it was supposed to be paid for and it would not be arriving.
I was not pleaded  since I wanted 3 hours to pick it up and could have gotten it by that time somewhere else. I asked for a manger so I could get it shuttled over asap.
The biggest jerk ever Manager Wes located the item and blamed me for being upset and wanted me to explain why I was being rude. I explained that Cody told me it was not possible to get my item without paying and I needed it that night. Wes was so condescending and self righteous. He has no understanding that a customer who is told an item is arriving and then is told it is not going to be delivered might be a little stressed and upset.
Wes needs training as a manager. Customers will be upset and a good manager defuses rather than argue with a customer about the internal policies. How was I supposed to know I was supposed to pay first? If I was told I would have gladly done so.
All Wes had to do is state that Cody was correct that the policy was to pay first but it was still shuttled over. He could have been better and understood the error was on their side.
I was able to scramble and find my item at another store.
Never giving my money or business to this store.
To Larry's defence he asked the procedure to another co-worker when he was getting my item set up for transfer. I could hear him asking. Possibly Wes.
Thank you Larry for efforts.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1552999791408, 'text': 'Hello, Mykl. In order to improve this, please send us an e-mail telling your experience to customersupport@napaonline.com -Thank you - NAPA'}</response>< gmapID>

< Review>
The customer service here was exceptional. I don't live near a Napa Auto Parts, but I always think of it as a *real* parts shop. Anyway, I just needed a battery and Declan was very helpful and provided solid advice of things to consider when replacing it. I purposely went there to get an Optima Red Top for my Outback that loves to consume batteries like french fries. Once again, great service by mechanically-experienced staff.

Big, clean store with lots of car parts.< /Review>

Staff is not concerned about customer needs, almost like you being there is an inconvenience. Waited more then 15 minutes, while on my way to walking my daughter to school, to get new brake pads while a employee would rather get caught up with an old friend. Walked out not getting what I needed, if I could, this place deserves 0 stars.< /text>

I was looking for a headlight. After standing and looking for over 5 minutes I had 2 employees walk right past me and not say a word or ask if I needed help. I then approached the front desk where 3 employees were "helping" one customer and 3 others were doing who knows what on their computers. Once they were done with customer they all admired some amazing picture on another employee's Instagram account on their phone.
I'm going to order off of Amazon, and won't be back at this store.< /Text>

Never had problems until today. I walked in to receive some pricing on a battery. Lady was blunt and to the point, made no apologies for being so absolute. It was bordeline rude and disrespectful. I walked out and walked back in to purchase some additional products. I noticed she was helping another gentlemen, the service he received was 100% better than what I received. Dont know what the issue was. Just disapointed.< /text>

I give 3 stars because there is never a line and they have a huge inventory. Usually I exhaust all my other options before  purchasing a part here. Everything they sell here is double the price. The staff is not bad but not as helpful as autozone. If autozone doesn't have the part and you can't wait for it to come in online, go here.</text>

<text>I am not a local, I'm actually from eastern Oregon. Let me tell you, Tachikawa's has the best sushi I've tried in a super super long time. Might be the best. We did take out and the quality was exceptional! Price is great.<//text>< user_id>

If you haven't been, please go! Mom and pop owned. Everything here is amazing! Sashimi, rolls, bento box, etc... My regular is a sashimi combo, buba roll, hot sake and Sapporo and I am never let down. Their consistency is amazing. Very friendly staff. If you are someone who likes deep friend rolls, get their Oh Yes its fantastic. P.S. If you like anime, sit at the bar and talk to Chris, he is awesome ^_^ 10/10, HIGHLY RECOMEND!< /text>

Delicious food, friendly staff and great environment. Lots of regulars, which is always a sign that there is consistent quality in both food and customer care. Hadn't been in years simply for it not being near anywhere I lived. Now its on my way home from work, happy to make it a regular dinner stop!</Review>

We put this fine restaurant in our phone list  and we will definitely come back very soon. We highly recommend.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><Review>I come here on a fairly regular basis with my work crew. A huge plus for us is they allow us to order in advance so we can time when to arrive and make the most of our lunch hour. MUCH APPRECIATED Tachikawa. Thank you!

Service is always friendly but considering they only have one wait person during lunch, it can be slooooow at times. Food is consistently good. Ambiance is nice. Prices are moderate. Presentation is great sometimes and other times just okay. Overall it's a solid 3.5 stars. Rounding up half a star for letting us order in advance for our reserved table.< /Review><gmapID>0x808576577ada7b85:0xce743ec083833d51< /gmapID>< userid>

Food is very good and is at a reasonable price. The service is always friendly. Can get busy and you can end up waiting for some time at certain times of the day but it's worth the wait.<//Text>

Very well organised and convenient place. They serve big meals and for inexpensive rates. I enjoyed the meals very much and the staff members were very amiable and explanatory. I recommend this place.<//Review>

This site is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. everytime  I want to go to a proper dinner, this is the place that comes instantly to my mind. fresh and all kinds of  food and a large menu.helpful staff members, and nice ambience. Also, the cost is affordable. I sent my friends to this restaurant with no hesitation.< /review>

As for the rest, well, it's only OK. The rolls that I had (salmon skin, rainbow roll, California roll) were nothing to write home about. I also had salmon teriyaki and can say the sauce was not very flavorful and had the consistency of wet snot. Tasted ok, just weird.</text>< pics>

The volcano and miso soup would have earned 5 stars but the rainbow dragon roll was very average. It wasn't well put together at all unfortunately. I would certainly recommend and will have to try other options< /Review>< pics>

They claim they close 9pm went in there 8:40 to place order and didn't want to make the order because according to them they stop taking orders 830pm,they should let people know what time they close or what time they don't want to work anymore and update the hours of operation on google had to drive 30 minutes what a waste of time ... 👎👇↘️</Text>

<review>My friend and I ate here twice recently. I had the Yaki Soba both times and it was amazing; hot, fresh and flavorful. I also had assorted sushi rolls, sashimi and nigiri. My friend loved the bento boxes she ordered. The service was very prompt and friendly and the prices were not too bad. We will definitely be putting this place in our rotation, as it's fairly close to home.< /review>< pics>

Good sushi and prices.  Service is fast and very friendly.  Only thing on the negative side is they don't put much ice in their drinks, but you can asked for more with no problem.</review>

It's a quaint place. Very quiet and good place to have one on one conversations with people. Sushi is relatively good.< /text>

<Text>Hostess very rude it says 230 but if you show up at 2 they won't seat you the chef told the hosts it was up to her if she wanted to seat me and she said no well you probably just missed out on your best tip of the day if I was the owner I would be angry your missing out on business.   but there's plenty of other sushi restaurants I can spend b my money at< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<rate>4</rate><text>Closer to a 4.5. than a 4. We have a great time each time we come. There may be a wait occasionally, but the food tastes good, we've never gotten sick, and they have a happy hour at the perfect time (5-6:30PM). They're also close to home, so when we are craving sushi, we always come here. Not as fancy as some of the bigger places, but the service is attentive, and they're more than okay with families (read:small children) coming in for dinner. We'll keep going here as long as they're open.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>The sushi is always fresh and have always had a great experience. Shop around,but youll find more overpriced sushi restaurants and the sushi quality is poor.If your like me and looking for good quality sushi this is your spot.I don't mind paying a lot for quality but this place is high quality at a reasonable price.CHECK IT OUT</Text>< pics>

<text>We love this local sushi joint. The staff is always friendly and recognizes us. We even were seated at our favorite table tonight. The Tiffany Roll is an explosion of flavor. Well worth it for a specialty roll. I always take an 8 pc of salmon sashimi. Never dissapoints with freshness and flavor. The music is a fun mash up of current hits. Overall a gem in Pinole for sushi!</text></record></dataset><record>

Went there on three separate days at three different times and never got seated after waiting 30 minutes even though there was no one else in the restaurant except the lazy, useless (non)workers.< /text>

Go there all the time..close to home..they do get packed..so if you don't get there when they open for dinner there is a wait..that is.because food is freshly made...good service..</Review>

(Translated by Google) We had to wait a bit, the site is a bit small. The food is not bad, it didn't take long to prepare it. 49ers roll.

This is hands down one of the best SMP/Recreational Center/ Arcade/bowling alley/bar I've ever been to. The staff is wonderful, friendly and very accommodating. Becca man's the front desk like a champ! The bartender is always readily available to serve another round and the bowling is free on Fridays during 11-1. Can't get much better than that< /review>

We visited the bowling alley on Family Day for the Bravo graduation. We ended up here on accident because we had pre-ordered our pizza from Domino's but there were no other tables and seats left. The bowling lanes were very inexpensive yet up-to-date! We had pizza and bowling on the first day I was able to see my brother after 13 weeks - It was an awesome experience!<//review>

<Text>Great little bowling alley.  Kid friendly numbers and ramps for younger bowlers.  Summer special is great where the kids bowl 2 games free and you pay for shoes only.  Dominos pizza is the food available in the alley.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place was really fun but that day I went MY FEET WERE BURNING 😂 just thought I add that but anyways it's cool place if you just want to hang out and bowl you can do so trust me you won't regret it you'll have lots of fun . The food is good but then again that's just my opinion (:<//Review>

<text>I've been going here for years and the bowling side has always been the same, not that it's a bad thing, but the video game side had been slowly deteriorating into nothing and now there's two really busted up video games, two air hockey tables, and a ping pong table. There's also a domino's inside which is extremely convenient especially if you're having a party and all around the building they've installed little tablets in the wall where you can order from.< /text>< Rate>

This place is so good! Their service and food is amazing. They were recommended by a friend and we are so glad we went. Everything was so good. The only bad thing was we ate too much! We are going to make this our place to eat every time we go to Tahoe. Thank you for the great experience and food!!<//text>

<text>Their food and their service is outstanding. The menu is on the pricey side but worth every penny for the professional dining experience they provide. It feels like a special occasion even when it's not.  They space out dining groups giving a very safe feeling. Their servers are wonderful. Gabe is our favorite, very courteous. Thank you Scusa Italian Restaurant ♡</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Service was excellent. Plenty of parking. Not too busy. Easy access location with a red light on the parking lot so its trivial to leave even during traffic. Food arrived very quickly, maybe in 10 or 15 minutes, and was cooked to perfection.< /Text>< pictures>

Shocked at all the five star reviews. Food was MICROWAVED and prepackaged. Very ugly dinner for the price. Izzys burger spa is more honest and tasty, right down the street<//Text>

<Review>Harrah's $350. a nite. 5 star. I'm sorry the bathroom hadn't been swept or cleaned in day's. The restaurants smelled like unclean old food. The hotel has not been kept up in the last few years. Bill's  gone so is his hotel.<//Review>< Pictures>

<date>1616511463349<//date><text>Very nice and intimate setting. Families sat at least six feet apart due to covid regulations,  which made the place quieter. Service was great and they had some great vegetarian choices which I want. The angel hair pasta dish with tomatoes (not sauce), black olives, and capers was heavenly - didn't make you feel full, but delighted you with the flavors. Good wine selection too. Definitely worth going to,  more than once. Reservations a must,  so don't expect to go and find space easily.<//text>< Pics>

This place was amazing. My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here. Service was impeccable and the food was soooooo good. My wife had the chicken and ravioli and I had the Osso Bucco special. My Osso bucco was perfectly braised and so tender.  We purchased an order of focaccia too to dip in the yummy sauce! We will be back for sure. This place is not to be missed!< /Text>

Food was so sooooo good. Absolutely loved the lobster ravioli. Get it for an appetizer or entree, you won't be disappointed. Great service, great wine selection, and no bad choice for any menu item.<//Review>

Attended during a girls weekend. The service was great. The food is DELICIOUS. Everyone got a different dish and Everyone was very pleased. Only thing is that I wished they had other beverages other than wine. A cocktail would've been great. But atmosphere and food were great. A must when there.</Review>

One of the very best in town if you're craving for a feast of Italian food. All the classics made with the freshest of ingredients. Good selection of wine to choose from. Ask for chef recommendation.< /text>

Awesome food. It is costly but worth trying if you like italian. 1star less coz ambience is not that great, though it is clean and hygenic. But the team is good. They waited patiently for us to finish food peacefully.< /review>

The staff was a bit off, not the italian vibe at all...

Your host was very rigid and an empty restaurant we were shoved in a corner... not sure the theory behind that but very much disatisfactory BUT we were hungry and your food made up for the non Italian hospitality....

The young server was profesional.and did.well< /review>< pics>

After being seated it took a while for the server to initially visit the table. Then another long while to bring our water. The food was delicious however. We had the Fettucini Alfredo, Mediterranean Pasta, and Veal Sambocca.</review>

<text>My family and I had a wonderful evening at Scusa. Great service and good wine and food along with a welcoming atmosphere. We paid Scusa a visit this past Tuesday when we arrived in South Lake Tahoe and decided to dine here again last night after we had a bad experience with different local restaurant. We immediately gave Scusa a call on a Friday evening and they were able to squeeze in our party of 4 without a reservation. On the second dining experience, they didn’t disappoint and salvaged our last evening in Lake Tahoe!</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The place was very busy.  We were seated with only 5 minute wait, no reservations.  We sat outside in the lovely patio with heaters.  Very comfortable.  Service and food was excellent.  Of course they practiced social distancing.  Wonderful experience.</Text>

One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in some time, Scusa serves up 5 star dishes with impeccable service.
The quiet cozy restaurant is the perfect place to take a date for a romantic evening out.
Each appetizer, entree, and dessert is made from scratch in-house by a chef who clearly takes time and pride in his work.
Not being in the heart of the busy South Lake Tahoe district is actually another great reason why you should make the short trip to Scusa for a quiet enjoyable evening.< /review>

<date>1595799939072< /date><review>If you're concerned with covid I would find an alternative. Three out of four servers assistants wore their mask with their noses exposed both days. When clean plates, water and food were served it was by someone with an exposed face. A cook came out to the restroom with their mask around their chin. Guests waiting were not asked to put on masks nor were guests when using the restroom. Someone forgot their mask and apologized and the young hostess said "it's not a big deal."

No visible management, you could tell they needed help operationally. The front was typically left empty and overwhelmed.

On the other hand, the food was amazing here, five stars for food and one of the reasons I braved it a second visit. Best in Tahoe with reasonable prices and big portions. The outdoor ambiance was very nice as well.

This is not an Italian restaurant. It's an American-Italian restaurant and has nothing to do with authentic Italian cuisine. Went there twice, because I thought maybe the first time I did not eat the right entree and starter... second time, different starter and entree, same experience. Their outdoor patio is really nice though and the service is also good.</review>

The food is good and surprisingly not too heavy. It is definitely somewhat expensive, but nothing unheard of for an Italian restaurant in such an area. The bathrooms are extremely clean and nicely secluded from the dining area. The servers and bussers are very nice and overall it was a very pleasant experience. My only real gripe is that the menu is somewhat limited.<//Text>

The food was very good. It was served hot, and was seasoned appropriately. The only reason it’s getting 4 stars is the wait staff; while our waiter was very polite and courteous, he was a bit inattentive and I found myself having to call his attention on a regular basis. He checked on us maybe one time during the duration of our meal. The drinks were also a little skimpy on the ice...overall a great meal, I look forward to trying it again in the future.< /text>

The environment is good. The spaghetti tastes great. However, if you don't like sand in clams, avoid ordering anything with clams. 90% of clams in my order has sand. I beared with it for  the first two clams, but basically dumped the entire dish in the end.</text>

<Text>This place has nosedived recently.

Arrived 15 minutes for our reservation late due to weather issues, so understandable when asked to wait 10 minutes.

However, 25 minutes later, after listening to several complaints/conversations about how understaffed they were, we left.

Such a shame that a place like this is so mismanaged that a hostess openly complains in front of customers. Makes you doubt the quality and safety of the food.

I won't be going back. There's plenty of other quality options in South Lake Tahoe.< /Text>< Pictures>

The food is good and surprisingly not too heavy. It is definitely somewhat expensive, but nothing unheard of for an Italian restaurant in such an area. The bathrooms are extremely clean and nicely secluded from the dining area. The servers and bussers are very nice and overall it was a very pleasant experience. My only real gripe is that the menu is somewhat limited.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Our outdoor dining experience was exquisite - bistro lighting, soft Italian music and magnificent food! I had the Fresh Salmon Scaloppine with lemon-caper butter and linguine. Every bite was a renewed experience to my taste budds.  I couldn't get enough! The salmon was cooked to perfection. A little crust on the outside. It just melted in my mouth.

I don't normally eat all my food, but I did this time.  I just couldn't get enough of it. It's been several days and I'm still thinking about it! ❤

The setting is perfect.  The tables are kept at a great distance. The prices are great! Honestly, this is a best kept secret in South Lake Tahoe.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>We had a fairly good experience here. Service was extremely slow, but we went on an evening during Christmas week so that was to be expected.

We got a roasted garlic crostini dish as an appetizer. This was delicious.

For an entree I got the chicken linguine. The flavors weren’t bad, but there was far too much liquid in the dish.

For dessert we got coffee and tiramisu, which was pretty tasty.</review>< pictures>

<review>Fantastic classic Italian cuisine. Great live saxophone and dim lighting made for a wonderful environment to eat in. The place has good decor and isn't in disrepair.

Menu is not to large which is always a good sign, and prices were good for the quality of food. Staff seemed knowledgeable of the menu and never had any issues concerning questions with recommendations.

Great find within South Lake and definitely we'll be back.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHCTjROI1kq3NX5f5aorf2pWpqtMjGxiwChO16=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

First time out for dinner date in Tahoe and was looking for a nice Italian restaurant happened to give this place a try and I have to say best decision ever . Great food , great service and awsome atmosphere and the live music was great, wasn't to loud so it was soothing to hear as we had our dinner . Server gave us the special for the night an we went ahead and tried the appetizer he suggested which was lobster ravioli and it was amazing ! If you're ever out in Tahoe and want an great meal Scusa is a must</text>

I will never eat at another Italian restaurant again. Scusa fair pricing great staff. If it's on the menu get it! Because you will ne er forget it. Starters....get the Garlic cream soup! And a order of Garlic bread. I had the 14 oz steak and wife had Chicken pinata. Plus one bottle of good wine and dessert 113.00 !!! Awesome dinner and quality.< /review>

This Italian restaurant is amazing. Our waiter was Zack. He projected really good energy and was sharp. He picked up on what we wanted ahs gave us great choices. Had an amazing evening with my girlfriend here.

We’re here on vacation from CT, and were looking for a nice italian dinner. We found Scusa Italian Restaurant, and everything about our experience was amazing. From the service, down to the dessert, & even the atmosphere, WOW! Will absolutely be visiting this resturant again! Highly reccommended! 5 starts is not enough!<//Text>

It pains me to have to say this but this is one of the worst Italian restaurants I have ever encountered in my life. As a retired professional chef trained in fine dining for over 35 years I find this restaurant lacking every aspect of an Italian restaurant. Number one the food comes out cold  that’s a no-no. The chef is very heavy-handed in garlic which tends to mute the other flavors of the entrée. My   Linguine and clams had no clam flavor and the broth  Was just pure garlic and lemon juice. The veal marsala was absolutely horrible. When you ate the veal the flavor and taste of the flour came off in your mouth  A very painful experience. To call this in Italian restaurant is to slander the name of Italian restaurants. After reading many of the reviews I was hoping for an excellent dining experience but was extremely disappointed By the quality of food and the manner in which it was prepared. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who has a sophisticated palate who knows fine dining and   Is experience in  excellent food ftom Italy this is not the place to go<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>If you are looking for an amazing dine-out experience at South Lake Tahoe this is the spot, and I explain why I said so.
Excellent dishes!! The food here is made with lots of love, the flavor in each appetizer and entree is yummy big thanks to the chef and the amazing cooks for a delightful dinner. Omg those lobster raviolis were soooo good very nice  pasta and the sauce was very tasty, the scampi shrimp amazing as well and the Scusa garlic bread we couldn'stop ordering them we eat like 5 orders lol (thumbs up for the one that came free after yelp check in)  Also I was amazed how good the food was and the price was very very  reasonable, I wouldn't even mind pay a little more, YES it was that amazing and special!!!
The venue: It has a lovely patio seating, lighting and natural decor came to be a romanticized night for all of us. The tables are spread respecting social distancing standards, which I think it was awesome even tho being part of a tourist zone and taking all the precautions for everyone's sake it is something to applaud on these challenging times. (Not forgetting all staff members wore globes, mask, and being very careful about not stay very close to the guest. )
The STAFF: Since the moment I was making a reservation a week before I knew I was going to a nice place, the lady that took my reservation was very friendly and accommodating The day of our dinner, the host  Diana and another lady right next to her also super nice, even tho we were a little behind on our reservation they were super friendly and welcoming right when we enter the door.
Waiter IAN great service he was super super nice and profesional, he make sure we were happy refilling our waters, given also perfect timing between each course like I said even tho we were there an hour past close time, we didn't feel any kind of rush he recommend amazing specials, took our group pictures which I appreciate so much
Brandon and Tom also took care of checking on us all the time and also very friendly service.
There you have it I couldn't say even a little bad thing about this place, I can wait to come back to Tahoe and visit Scusa once again and I will tell to all my Bay Area people to do it as well if they are in the area. Grazie infinite Scusa for an unforgettable night.<//review>< pics>

A very nice experience, we dined on the patio in back. I had the clams, shrimp and mussels Scuza and it was delicious. Also started with the garlic bread Scuza style, like a bruscheta with melted mozzarella, really delicious. Service was also very good, attentive staff</text>

I can only say so much about a place for you to know I am in love. This place has a special place in my heart. The is unbelievable; reminds me of my grandmothers cooking. I would make time to drive all the way here from Reno just to have lunch. If you haven't been; just go.</review>

Great Italian! We had the calamari as an appetizer and it was 10 out of 10. Light, not greasy, tender, and very crispy! The Chicken Parmesan was also excellent! The portion sizes were very generous and the flavors were on point. I would say that the atmosphere could use a little refresh but overall it was excellent.<//text>

We reserved a table for 10 ahead of time. We got there and they were expecting us already and we received one of the best restaurant experiences of my life. It was so nice and needless too say the food was amazing. My friends and I had an amazing time here and because of this experience my friends and I will make it tradition to come here everytime we come over here for vacation.<//review>

The only reason I give it a 4 star is because it is pretty dark in there.

<Review>It wasn't quite as good as it normally is. The food was ok, the service was ok just nothing like any of our past experiences when the food and service was excellent.
For as pricey as they are, one would think they would know the difference between medium and medium rare in a steak... we will give them a try again since our past experiences have all been good.</Review><Time>1572151859010<//Time>< gmapID>

Outside is nice as it faces the woods. The food is not bad but nothing special either. Service  was polite and well timed. The server spilled the tomato sauce all over the floor as he was putting the dishes on the table beside us.<//Text>

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving for Italian food while staying in Tahoe. This place had awesome Italian pastas and the service was superb. And I really loved our waiter, he constantly checked on us and refilled our water. They gave us complimentary garlic bread. And he recommended two dishes and they were great. Loved it. I would definitely, go there again.

Parking--they have a private lot so plenty of space.

I would recommend making reservations since this place gets full easily.<//Text>

Staff was friendly, we were seated immediately upon arrival for our reservation. Waiter was nice and no problems with the orders, we did have to request refills on the water. All meals in our party were brought out in a timely manner and were good. No problems with any of the meals and everyone had a great time.</Review>

We had a group of 15. Excellent service, our waiter took care of everything, he asked another waiter to help when our food was served and only waited on 1 plate. We had reservations and was seated promptly. Food portions are very generous and delicious. Oh   and the dessert of hot brownie , ice cream with choc. Raspberry sauce was worth the calories!!! Our family table each took a couple of bites.<//review>

We recently spent a week around Lake Tahoe and one of our best dining experiences was at Scusa.  The lobster ravioli appetizer should not be missed.  Fantastic!  I had a seafood pasta dish that was also excellent.  The shrimp were perfect and the clams were the plumpest and juiciest I've ever eaten.  My wife had a chicken past dish and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  Most restaurants seem to cook chicken breast until it is dry and tasteless, but this was tender and juicy.  The decor is a bit dated, but the food is excellent.<//text>

<text>Everything was amazing, the service was top notch with the waiter checking back regularly but not lingering or being awkward and the food was phenomenal. We ordered the artichoke and calamari appetizers, both had a unique twist to a common fare, the artichoke was especially delicious.  The entrees were brought out in perfect timing, were so delicious and the portions were more than generous.<//text>< pics>

Only okay.   Probably awesome for Tahoe but compared to Bay Area Italian it is only passable.   The spaghetti and meatballs were in an overly sweet sauce.  The clams and linguini were swimming in sauce and overly lemony and not enough garlic.  The bread was under cooked and bland.</Review>

Went here on spur of  Moment on a Thursday evening and was sat within 30 minutes and a wonderful table in a quaint little Courtyard. The staff was all very friendly and professional service was fast and the food was extraordinary old world recipes had a the veal scallopini piccatta style and the pork osso bucco and both were excellent as was the bread which had just the perfect crispnessess... hat's off to the to owner and management and staff ...look forward 2 enjoying again. Zack great waiter.< /Review>

<review>One of the best 5 Italian/ Sicilian  restaurants I have had the pleasure of enjoying in California. The Spinach Pasta Mediterranean has the perfect mix of spices and ingredients. The Cannoli’s are authentic Sicilian and in my book (being Italian) are hard to come by. Definitely my new to go to when staying in Tahoe.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef</gmapID></record>

Service is very good.
Food is not the best : Bread and tomato was way too big for an appetizer and a bit tasteless, while pasta dishes contain almost no pasta. If I order chicken pasta, I want pasta and not twice as much of chicken.
Prices are way too high for the quality served.</Review>

<review>Really delicious, homemade with care and good old fashioned Italian authenticity. Excellent apps & salad but the entrees were standouts - lasagna was perfect & the petroleum sole with lemon caper sauce over angel hair pasta was perfectly prepared & absolutely delicious! A great S Lake Tahoe find!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Delicious! Wide variety of dishes, seafood, turf meats,  and simple pastas. Service is top notch. Ambience is romantic, relaxing, and warm. A little expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for with your experience.<//Review>

<Review>I took the first bite and for the rest of the meal I couldn't stop saying "wow" and "mmmmm" and "oh my gosh this is so goood". It was absolutely delicious. The best Italian restaurant my husband an I have been to. The lobster ravioli is to die for. Especially if you dip some garlic bread into the sauce. Yum! We are literally talking about going back there tonight.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>Not sure why the local reviews love this place.  I found the food to be the quintessential lowest denominator Italian food.  The burrata was “grainy” (similar to the one you can buy at the supermarket), my pasta dish was mostly chicken brest bathing in cream with almost no pasta.  I adore tiramisu and am rarely disappointed by it, but again that was subpar.  Live Jazz was a nice touch.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I dined at this restaurant two nights in a row last weekend. I am gluten free and was in great hands with the waiter. Both my husband and I had great meals. He is not gluten free. I wish I lived closer to Tahoe as I would dine here frequently. I had the polenta with chicken and artichoke's the first night. My husband had the seafood fettuchini. The second night I had gluten free pasta with fresh tomatoes and basil.</Review>

Wonderful staff, decent prices, outstanding garlic bread. Break scalopini was delish, and freak apparatus drizzled with perfect holindaise. Go there you'll love it.</text>< pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><text>We were hankering for Italian. It was either here or Cafe Fiore.  We chose this because it was on our way to our hotel.  I had Angel hair pasta. Tasty!  House salad was one of the best I've ever had. Wife had lasagna.  It was good. But it was only luke warm in middle. They exchanged it (one less star) but they did comp her wine. It was also our birthdays and they gave us free tiramisu and brownie with ice cream.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef</gmapID></record>

< review>
One of the best Italian restaurant experiences and food I've ever had and well worth the price. We were served warm and soft focaccia bread with oil and vinegar to start. Their Caesar salad was not as creamy as I would have liked, but it was still very tasty. The special for the day, a filet of sole over lemon caper white wine angel hair, was extremely tasty and filling. Their Alfredo sauce has an intricate and layered taste, not just the cheesy goodness in other Italian restaurants. Portions were just right. The tiramisu was lovely. If you're looking for REAL Italian food at a reasonable cost, this is the place!< /review>

<Text>The staff and ambiance at Scusa Italian Ristorante was fantastic! Me and my husband wanted to celebrate a special event and they treated us like royalty.  We not only got stellar service, but the food was amazing! My husband got the SEAFOOD FETTUCCINE and I had the SHRIMP, CLAMS AND MUSSELS SCUSA.  We were both fighting over who's dish was better. Oh and we also had the GARLIC BREAD SCUSA for appetizer, again, amazing!

Anyways, I can not speak more highly of the staff and food. We will definitely be back whenever we are in South Lake Tahoe! Thank you to the staff and General Manager at Scusa, you really went above and beyond and made our night so special!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef< /gmap_id></record>

I had to wait for an hour to get a table, but it was worth waiting for it. I ordered a pasta with seafood (SEAFOOD FETTUCCINE) and it was delicious. Also a big meal, I was full of this together with the lovely breath with olive oil. Only thing I missed was a wifi network to use while waiting.<//text>

<text>Our reservation was for 730 and we arrived sooner than expected. About 45 minutes to be exact. We were took by the host that our tble was being set up. So we waited. There was no bar; however, there was a man playing his saxophone. No bar with a tiny waiting area that could open up to a more comfy, breathable area.

Once we were seated, our waiter came around 10 minutes later to serve us water and champagne. He then came back another 10 minutes later for our appetizer order. The most of the appetizers were delish. We ordered garlic cheese bread, lumaca scusa (escargot), Caesar salad and burrata. I just wish the house butter tasted better for the escargot. It was very bland. And then another 10-15 minutes after our appetizers arrived, the waiter took our entree order.

I ordered the linguine clam. That was a bust! It tasted clammy. Very bland. I even added parmesan cheese, pepper & salt to mask the flavor. I thought it would have more flavor. The clams need to be bathed in some seasoned salt, pepper, garlic, butter, chili powder and some other spices. It tasted as if the clam were taken from its container dumped into the pan with some type of watered down butter sauce and then linguine was added.

I knew I should've played it safe and gone with the spaghetti and meatballs. That is what I would recommend!!! The veal was alright. It could've been better. I should've yelped the place too and read the reviews. A major plus ia that the water refills were on point as well as the upkeep of clearing the empty plates from the table,<//text>< Pics>

Food was good. Could have paid a litlle more attention to table arrangement with 6 people one table was a few inches higher than the other and we ended up moving. Other than that pretty good.<//review>

(Translated by Google) A few minutes from downtown Tahoe on Route 50 is this restaurant.
We went as a family on the night of December 31 last and all the diners agreed on how good we were.
The place is very warm. With seats near the window (I recommend them); and a nice light.
The first level service. Many waiters attentive that we will not lack anything.
My daughter ate some fettuccine with cream which I tried and they were very rich.
My lady fetuccines with alfredo sauce that she said were very tasty.
In my case I ordered an exquisite lasagna with tomato sauce.
Everything was very pleasant and with more than reasonable prices for this place.
We are going back this weekend since we loved it. Before returning to our country.

A pocos minutos del centro de Tahoe sobre la ruta 50 se encuentra este restaurante.
Fuimos en familia la noche del 31 de Diciembre pasado y coincidimos todos los comensales de lo bien que pasamos.
El lugar es muy cálido. Con butacas próximo a la ventana (las recomiendo); y una luz agradable.
El servicio de primer nivel. Muchos mozos atentos a que no nos faltará nada.
Mi hija comió unos fetuccines con crema los cual probé y estaban muy ricos.
Mi Sra fetuccines con salsa Alfredo que dijo estaban muy ricos.
En mi caso pedí una lasagna exquisita con salsa de tomate.
Todo fue muy ameno y con precios más que razonables para este lugar.
Vamos a volver este fin de semana ya que nos encantó. Antes de volver a nuestro país.< /review>

Menu without many options. I don't recommend the carbonara fetutine. A lot of sausage and the presentation of the dish is not pleasing to the eye. Price $$$

O ambiente é o ponto alto do restaurante. Mûsica ao vivo na sexta æ noite, quando fui. Cardápio sem muitas opções. O fetutine à carbonara nåo recomendo. Muita linguiça e a apresentação do prato não agrada aos olhos. Preço $$$<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>
