Food is incredible, waiter was incredible (pink hair and fabulous nails and all), and they are pet friendly. I had the chicken supreme tacos and they are some of the best I've had! Brought our pup a bowl of water and kept great conversation with us throughout the meal. We will be back, for sure!< /review></record>

Just a small little place on main street! I love being able to sit outside in the nice weather or go inside if it's cold! Their waiter is probably the friendliest guy I have ever met! The food is great as well! Every time family comes to town this is one place I always take them, and everyone has loved it!!</Review></record>

< Review>
Would give it zero stars if it were possible. Based on service.

We came in to Dos Geckos at the recommendation of my coworker. We ordered around 2pm, the place was not busy. We sat and waited for 45 minutes while we watched everyone who had showed up after us get their food. I asked our server if she put our order in, she replied "yes I did". Well another server walked by again, dropping food to another table who had showed up long after we had, so I asked her if she could see if our order was put in, well she came back and told us the truth, which was that our server had NOT put our order in after all, and she offered us a free beer to make up for it. (That was nice, but it was now 2:45 and I had to be at work at 3:30 in Dunsmuir, that's why I got to the restaurant at 2pm.)
She told me I could eat it in my car while I drive to work. I told her I didn't come to this restaurant to eat and drive. I went back outside to our table, checked the time, noticed it was getting close to time I would need to leave and she comes outside and drops the bill at our table without a word. WE HAVE NOT EVEN GOTTEN ANY FOOD AT THIS TIME. That was the last straw.  My boyfriend went inside gave them the bill and we left. I asked for a manager before we left, they said there wasn't one there. If the owner reads this, I would really like to talk to you about our service on this day. I am a server/bartender In fine dining establishments and I am a very compassionate person. This experience was unacceptable by any measure.</Review>

Food was over priced for what it was, which I could overlook if the service had been awesome (it wasn't), or if the sweaty cook hadn't repeatedly wiped the sweat from his forehead with his bare hands and gone right back to making burritos, or, if there hadn't been a large overflowing trashcan right inside the entrance and 5 feet from our table. Seriously though, there are better places to eat in Mt Shasta, try Phuket Thai, the brewery, pretty much anywhere that serves pizza or burgers.</text>

Best chicken tacos I've ever had. The seasoning on the chicken was unbelievable in the way they mix pico de gallo with very minced bell peppers was incredible topped off with cilantro and guacamole made it completely exquisite not to mention the corn tortilla was slightly toasted which made it perfect!</text>

<Review>Very small inside,  food was ok,  beans cold and favorless as was the rice....
Pico was cut to thick, very hard to enjoy, unprofessional banter between employees.
I like the salsas brought to the table,  red or verde,  chips crispy..
Overall,  we won't be back...< /Review>< name>

Remarkably poor service, forgot to bring us water, forgot to bring us chips, and forgot to submit our order to kitchen.  We we walked by about 50 times, I had to go inside and tell them we were forgotton.  Watched two other tables finish the whole order, eat, leave process as we sat there.  No apology, really annoyed.</text>

I like the quality of the food served, but it is entirely too expensive assuming it's even open. the hours are soo rediculous even locals can't seem to get in.

Ediy
Edit: the hours have changed, making it easier to get food, but the price versus what you get is still over the top.</Review>

(Translated by Google) A Mexican restaurant located in the center of Mount Shasta City. I had lunch at a table outside. I ordered burritos and tacos, all of which were delicious and voluminous. The price was relatively cheap. I think that it is a restaurant where you can enjoy a meal while watching the city.

(Original)
マウントシャスタシティの中央に位置するメキシコ料理レストランです。外のテーブルでランチをとりました。ブリトー、タコス等を注文しましたが、どれも美味しく、ボリュームもありました。また値段は比較的安めでした。街を見ながら食事を楽しめるお店だと思います。</text>

Horribly rude, unhelpful, dishonest staff sent me on a unnecessary wild goose chase driving all over town to another store that was just as rude and unhelpful. Don't get your phone plan with Verizon as I foolishly did. Boycot this company.<//review>

Updating my review as I was recently back in the store and had an amazing experience with the staff here I’ve been to this location over the years and the consistency of the customer service and my experience grows every time the other stores in the area are just not up to par with these guys anyways I’ve referred friends and family who have all thanked me and given their praises for the recommendation if not for the last couple experiences with this store I probably would have switched from Verizon to another carrier as they’re very competitive but so glad I stayed got my bill lowered again more than last time and still got too keep my unlimited data 5 stars all the way!</Text>

I came here to upgrade and get a new case/screen protector and Maria made the entire experience a breeze! I got my phone, a really cool case, and a tempered glass protector! She gave me a lot of good information on the phone and the process. I’m very happy we chose this store over the other ones nearby. It’s definitely worth your time!<//Text>

Store is clean and kept neat. Personnel were knowledgeable, helpful and kind; yet while the salesperson was helping me, he kept talking to his coworker buddies, during downtime, instead of focusing on me, the customer. Could indicate maturity level.</review>

Great service. Was looking to upgrade my rather old Samsung phone to a new Samsung phone, but Av educated me on why his favorite device was the Google Pixel. It is now my favorite phone hands down, and I’m saving money on my bill! Kudos to this team and management.< /Text>

<Text>I had stopped in as a means to pass the time   while I waited for family to complete their shopping in a nearby store , which i had expressed  the fact to the sales associate who had shadowed my every moment from the time I walked in . Previously being a Verizon customer  , now with T Mobile, my phone had the Verizon app. with my prior Verizon  account information , which the associate was able to view said information , that had automatically uploaded  to his hand held device where the Verizon  associate ,out of sheer desperation from lack of sales , was able to open a wireless  account in my name unbeknownst  to me. To this day it is on my credit file impacting negatively. I made several attempts  to clear this up to no avail  my only option is to file a police report and only then will Verizon take steps to clear this matter up. I am positive that some of you know who this jerk off is if you too had a poor encounter  at this location .<//Text>< rate>

<text>Absolutely rude and condescending staff. The store was entirely empty during the day when I brought my mother in for assistance. We have been Verizon customers for 15-something years and I had never been treated so poorly. We needed to transfer a number and possibly upgrade but none of the boys behind the counter wanted to help and simply handed me a phone number to call an automated service. I wanted to upgrade a phone and no one cared to make any sort of sales pitch on this... needless to say I took my mother and left to find much better service and a friendly staff at the nearby Verizon Victra store.</text><Name>Shauna Summers</Name><rate>1</rate>< Time>

<review>FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD. GO TO ANOTHER STORE!!!! Do not buy from AV, JEREMY, OR SYD. This store encourages reps to make customers think they are getting something that they will ACTUALLY pay for (add-ons, contracts, etc).  Even the managers are in on it and encourage this behavior. A manager from another location helped me discover that they nulled a jetpack contract that I was tricked into so that it would not show up or be traceable in their system. He even told me they were being "slimy" and did not condone their behavior.  When I had initially confronted the managers, they were even more disrespectful than the rep and told me I was lying I stead of FIXING it.  I was appalled. I have NEVER been treated this way by managers. Do yourself a favor and buy at another location.  There is a major difference between upselling and flat out "stealing".< /review>< Name>

This review is in regards to a particular employee at this store. She is a heavyset woman with glasses and long brown hair. Possibly mid 20's to early 30's. She could be either Caucasian or Latina. I would avoid dealing with this woman if possible. She deleted an app off my phone without my permission claiming that it was a clean sweeper app(it's not) and that it eats a lot of battery(it doesn't). I went to the store to ask a question about using the smart switch app, As I had gotten a replacement for a phone that was giving me problems. She asked what's wrong with it, when I told her she literally took the phone out of my hand and deleted the app.  I informed she shouldn't delete apps without asking the customer's permission first. She said "well I put it back for you ma'am" even though she called me ma'am she said it in such a condescending tone, that she made it obvious she thought she was talking to an idiot. A salesperson should never speak down to someone or talk to them in a way that their  tone of voice shows they think the customer is an idiot. She also took the protective film off the new phone which is something I never asked her to do. This person is not a technician. She's a sales person. She has no technical knowledge about phones. She doesn't even understand what certain apps do yet she'll delete them without your permission. If this sales woman approaches you, whatever you do, do not give her your phone to look at. If you do you'll risk having apps deleted and being spoken to in a condescending tone. The manager of this store needs to school her on how to treat customers.<//text>

< review>
I have never written a review before, this is my first! This is hands down the WORST experience I have EVER had! Don't ever go into this Verizon store. They will screw you completely over!! I went in to buy a new iPhone! And they lied to me about my trade in value, charged me twice for two covers, and two glass protectors. Charged me an activation fee on a device that was supposed to be free. Overall, I woke to a bill of $313 which took me all day to work out and a trip into the Verizon store. Where I was met with non-friendly faces. And the guy that told me my phone trade in was $200 says "oh well I said my manager would look into it" Really!?? Worst part is, I'm supposed to be happy about my new iPhone. But I'm not!< /review>

-9  John Carlos set me up with a new phone.  He even signed the contract for me and signed me up for the protection plan that I did not want.  Of coarse he denied signing anything when I had a manager around.  The manager, Lamont, was less than helpful.  When asked about John signing my contract, his response was "it is your word against his" and he was not concerned about the fact I was signed up for the protection plan when I was clear with John that I didn't want it.  While John is a shyster, Lamont is worthless and uncaring as a manager.  I may post more after dealing with the regional manager and Verizon.  These 2 should be fired!!!<//text>

<Text>ALLAN IS AMAZING. He offered great service and was honest about the devices, plan costs, and total charges.
However, VJ IS HORRIBLE. He looks like the "typical salesman. " Slicked back greasy hair and a phoney smile. He lied about the prices and current promotions. Be alert if you get him. Try to switch salespeople to someone else.< /Text>< userid>

They were semi nice to our face and talking about you behind our backs thinking we couldn't hear them.
They were NOT helpful people.
Poor customer service.
Not willing to exchange a phone that we're within our legal 14 day return/exchange policy that they themselves state on their receipts.
If I could give no stars that would be a better representation to there actions and attitudes.

I will never buy a phone from Verizon again.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I thought about writing about my 1 hour horrible experience at this Verizon but just thinking of it stresses me out. All i have to say is the Manager was very rude and made me feel uncomfortable.I should not have to feel like that at any store i enter! He needs a lot of training on his customer service and if i could remember his name(something like Quais) i would put him on blast! Any ways VERIZON TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE ESPECIALLY THE MANAGERS! Seriously considering cancelling my Verizon account after my experience yesterday.<//Review></record>

Terribly misquoted us (specifically Syd). Obviously just telling us what we wanted to hear to get us to buy the phone, not the truth. Try Bestbuy!<//text>

<Text>On May 01, 2014, I went into the Northridge Verizon store location 14287 to possible get a new phone with my family. The representative JD informed my husband and I that we can combine our accounts, get 2 brand new phones, 2 tablets and accessories for a total of $200.00 and my monthly bill will be less than $200.00 a month which is what we were currently paying. He brought out two baskets of accessories that we did not pick and charged my credit card and debit card. My husband and I confirmed with him and his manager that we would not be charged again or charged in any other way. Since we were there a couple of hours and they were closing, they were only able to finish one phone. I returned the next day to finish my husbands phone and get my in laws the same deal which took several hours as well. A couple days later, my phone started acting up. Fortunately, they were able to declare my phone a lemon and exchange it for a new one, which they took a couple hours and deleted important information that I informed them before they worked on the phone that I needed to be saved. JD informed me that it would not get deleted which it did. This information deleted cost my business tremendously! Since then, I received several bills all more than double what I usually pay. I went into the store several times and spoke to the manager who told me to return when the associate was there which is odd to me since he is the manager, he should have been able to help me. Every time I have gone to the store, I have waited hours. I also called customer service several times to get assistance and have been on the phone for several hours each time getting no resolution.
As a direct result of this transaction, We have paid over thousands of dollars to Verizon. I have proof of text messages from the associate and I, receipts and a witness to all of this. Today August 7, 2014, I called customer service again and was on the line for a total of an hour and forty minutes which I received no resolution. We have been Verizon Customers for over 20 years! This has been the worst service I have ever received. The associate lied and misinformed us. In addition, as a direct result of this, I was told by the manager at the store to pay my normal bill and remaining balance would get credited, which my phone actually was disconnected several times by them which is affecting my business. I am receiving calls from Verizon almost every day saying my bill is past due and will get disconnected.
In a recent phone conversation, you claimed that why would Verizon give free accessories. You also claimed that, even if I was misinformed, I should have brought the accessories back, which I went to the store and they said I was charged in error. Now three months later they are claiming the Verizon store is stating that they did not say any of those things.
As to these issues, we would not have changed our plans, combined them or changed our in laws as well. If we would have known that we would been charged these amounts we would not have done this. We do not use most of the accessories they gave us, we do not even need them.
I will take this matter as far as I need to in order to receive a resolution. I will contact the media, blog and even legal matters.
Please contact me immediately! I would like to file a grievance against the Northridge store, the associate and the manager that helped me. I should of realized that there were 2 people at the time also complaining when I purchased the phones to know that this store must be ripping people off at this location.
Sincerely,
Vanessa Jimenez< /Text>< date>

<time>1483732277591<//time><rating>1</rating><text>My wife went to this Verizon store a couple of months ago to buy a basic Phone for her Mom which she did, No problem there.
But while she was there one of the sales associate name Cesar sold her a Wifi hot spot which we have NO NEED for it. He told her that she only pays $25 sales tax Device is free and there is no monthly charges, When we found out there is a $20 monthly charge right away she went back to return it, But they insisted there is no monthly charges, we called Verizon they said yes, there is a $20 monthly charge for the Wifi hot spot.
So for the fourth time I also went there with her we explain the whole thing to the Manager name Raul He was very rude and unprofessional, he charged us $175 early termination fee to cancel something that we never ask for it we didn't need it, and it was pushed to us by false information and lies.
So we were charged $25 sales tax $40 two months service fee and $175 early termination fee. So it costed us a Total $240 and lots of frustration.....
I will never go back there again.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Long wait time. Very slow customer service,  and to make things worst, the phones and accessories on display don't have any information,  you need to wait for somebody to help you and at times there is only two people working.< /text>

The employees at this store are not honest they lie to you about the return policy, they charge stocking fees $35 but they tell you differently when you purchase the phone that you have 14 days to return with no stocking fees. This is the worst store ever.< /Review>

Cant get to a person on the phone, store employees are useless and there is no help to be had. I think Verizon is a terrible company with the worst employees and worst customer service, Sad really.< /text>

One of the worst Verizon stores in this planet, I have been there twice and both times the people had mega attitudes.  They don't know the meaning of customer service, if me staying with Verizon was based on that store, I would have been gone a long long long time ago.</Text>

<text>Busy busy busy...cramped space...lots if zipping traffic. If your a spanish speaker that will probably benefit you. Out of the 4 persons i tried talking to i got only one broken English response. Be persistent. Dont wait on them you need to be aggressive if you want your truck unloaded. New warehouse across the concrete drive so im sure once theyre fully open it will be more of a jockeying for space to turn n park.</text></record>

<text>Came here to deliver a load and this place told me to drop my delivery at a yard twelve miles from here and I did the problem was they were suppose to unload it here but I did what they told me to do. Then the agent told me its not suppose to be delivered to a yard. They were supposed to unload you. After I already dropped my load I had to reconnect again and come back to get unloaded when I came back they unloaded everybody else first and I was last one to be unloaded. Very bad place to have to come to.dont treat human beings this way.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmap_id>

Great warehouse and quality workers. Although they stumble through the same mistakes from time to time.</review>

<Review>Buyer be ware !!!! Stay away from this place since the charge you for items not purchased!!!. I’ve been going to this nursery for over 40 years. Yesterday I had a clerk who without counting the items charged me over$100.00 which seemed odd to me. When I mentioned that the tomato plants were on sale she was highly annoyed. She ran the bill again without looking at the plants and this time charged me $93.00 which was still too high. I asked for the itemized bill and she said they don’t have one and run everything by hand. Then she left. I looked at the bill and figured out that she had  charged me for 3 extra items that I had not purchased. I asked another younger clerk to correct the bill and she was too scared and intimidated to do it but finally at my insistence corrected the bill. I asked for the manager NICK and explained the situation but instead of apologizing and saying that he’ll make sure that his workers pay attention, he was rude, arrogant and said that I don’t have to buy from there which I will not. I know times are hard for businesses but it does not justify stealing and being rude and arrogant about it.< /Review>< userid>

Very nice, organized well, all plants are clearly marked. They have trees, fruit trees, shrubs, herbs, California natives and much more. There's also a cute gift shop. Reasonable prices. Recommended!</Review>

Succulent selection ok. 3 stars due to poor customer service. I've been here numerous times, employees never greet me and are always on their phones or chatting amongst themselves.< /text>

<text>Decent selection. The best part is they have a cute little store kitty that roams the premises. I gave them three stars because we bought a plant and a pot, and they charged us $4 to put the plant into the pot because they had to add a handful of soil to it (we didn't want to buy a whole bag but like...come on, you couldn't just give us a scoop of soil for buying all that??).<//text>< Date>

<rate>2</rate><review>Narrow selection of indoor plants and minds. Capacity for the indoor gift and plant shop is 8 people at a time. We waited for permission to enter, despite there being no one else in line and only two people inside, as we were a group of 4. We were let in but immediately, one of the female cashiers loudly and condescendingly called out "We're at capacity with THEM." We begin looking over the selection of plants and one of our group mentioned in Spanish they have peace lilies and explaining to another of the group the growing requirements, when an employee interjects quickly to ask "Peace lilies? You're looking for peace lilies?" After laughing it off and saying no, the first cashier loudly sighed and told the second employee "I'm just expressing how I feel internally, externally." Finally at the check-out, I HANDED the original rude cashier my card, to her HAND. She returned it by quickly slapping it down on the counter. I was surprised and I think it showed on my face, even with my mask on. She must have seen my reaction and then handed me my receipt. As another person from our group was paying and thanking the cashier, another employee behind the cashier turned to look with an upset expression at our friend. Bad customer service,
and it's difficult to tell who the employees are unless they're behind the counter.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>It'a a great nursery. Staff are very helpful and knowledgable. They have a cute gift shop in which they sale local crafts, pottery, honey and indoor plants. They ssle most of fruit trees. Varieties of apple, peach, cherry, plum, jujube, asian pear, apricot trees.
They also have various flower trees like lilacs, roses and mamy more.
They have variety of sun plants however their sun plants are a little overpriced comparing to other nurseries and gardening centers of chain suppliers.
They have a pottery corner as well which is very reasonable and fairly priced. They also have outdoor water features and variety of mulch, tool, formulas and gardening tools. I highly recommend it to plant and gardening enthusiasts.</review>< rating>

Warning: This is the best nursery with the most knowledgeable and friendly staff! I love all the staff members here  since they all go above and beyond to provide the best customer service! Thank you! I wish I had asked for their names to acknowledge them all by name here for all their help.

This place has a very large selection of high quality, popular roses and many other variety of flowers to trees. I was very surprised to find all the roses I couldn’t find at other local nurseries as well as rare flowers such ice plants. It’s too bad that I had already purchased my ice plants online last week, after trying several nurseries before discovering Almaden Valley Nursery today.  Although this place isn’t as inexpensive as Home Depot’s Gardening section, you’ll be impressed by the quality and variety of flowers and trees. I’ve never found the popular roses I’ve wanted at Home Depot. I was very happy to see some of the popular roses that I could not find at other local nurseries or online such as Barbara Streisand Lavender Rose (Weeks Rose), Love Rose (which is a bright red rose with white reverse by Weeks Rose), and Mr. Lincoln, which is also by Weeks. They were all very healthy and tall roses with fragrance and a bunch of buds. The most fragrant is the Mr. Lincoln Red Rose. I have purchased Mr. Lincoln in the past but the other three roses are new roses that I’ve wanted.  I had a hard time deciding but I had limited space in my car so I purchased four roses and a violet color Geranium Rozanne as pictured below. The forth rose I bought today from Almaden Valley Nursery was clearly mislabeled by the supplier since it was labeled as one of the stripped color roses; yet, it’s a very fragrant rose bush with very large hot pink double blooms; I think it’s an English Rose. The roses were $49.99 but they said the price was $47 each because I was bought more than 3 roses. I’m in love with this nursery and will be back soon! Thank you. 💜💙💜<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Nick, the store manager is completley rude, lacks grace, is disrespectful with not a trace of customer service. When asked to speak with the owner Matt Lepow he ignored the request. I found the staff to be young with little knowledge of gardening and landscaping needs and care.

I drove 105 miles round trip to find out that every branch on the Kafir Lime tree has insects. Nick's response was it was common simiular to a rose having aphids. That is some damage from citrus leaf miner. It was sprayed but may need additional spraying. This if from a moth that lays its eggs on the leaf and then the larva tunnels in it making it curl.  This insect is very wide spread and the plants are even shipped to us from our supplier with damage from this insect especially when it is high pressure which is in spring and the end of summer.  I explaines had I known I would have not purchaed.

Now I have to drive another 105 miles to return the infested tree. He said that was my decision not his.  His response was since I was angry that I had to travel he would save me the trip if I cut the tree at the base, send him a photo to confim the act and than he would refund me over the phone.

What a waste to an expensive tree that is in high demand. They should have treated it before sputting it on sale.

I suggest HOME DEPO to AVN or better EAST BAY nurseries  - Always  with awesome and super passionate staff.< /review>< pictures>

The flowers are not well organized. It’s not easy to find what you want. Also staffs are not as friendly as other local nurseries. When I finally picked the flower from a unnoticeable  corner, but it is little bit over closing time. I told the staff that I drove a long way to get here, however they just refuse to check out it for me. It’s a bad shopping experience.</Review>

I understand reopening after COVID 19 has been tough on so many businesses...AVN is no exception.  I've always so enjoyed shopping here for healthy plants and a great variety. The plant selection wasn't the usual abundant stock and  what was available seemed a little withered.  That being said I will continue to shop here.  They have great service and I'm sure will rebuild the vitality of the plants to their usual vibrance in no time!  I will continue to support the comeback of our local businesses.</text>

I had the worse experience in nursery ever at your place. It would be nice if you kindly update your FB page that you do not let anyone go in after 3:30pm.

I arrived at 3:35pm, I was told I cannot go in, which is fine, I politely explained to your staff that I couldn’t come from 10-3:30pm but I need to buy 2 tree roses, asked if there is any other way he can help since I was there already, he said come on another day. I explained couple times that I couldn’t due to kids learning restrictions, I asked if you guys carry tree roses, he said yes, come check it out another day. I asked him which types, I wish to get combination color types and he said yes, you guys carries it but he doesn’t know which type. I asked if he could get me a list, he said come another day to find out. I asked couple times if I could find information somewhere else, and he said FB. I check immediately but couldn’t find it and he said he can’t help, he don’t know where to find it. I asked if he can’t ask someone that knows the answer, he said he can’t. Since I just keep asking him questions, finally he asked someone, then he came back and said check FB, there is a list. I checked and found that it has a Bush rose list, I asked him if tree rose is different? That is a list for Bush rose, and he said he can’t help. Under pandemic situation, with all the changes, I understand it is not easy for everyone, he said he have to make sure people come out on time and so he cannot ask anyone to help me. That’s helpful, I asked him if he have told the person he asked that I am looking for tree rose and that list for Bush rose may or may not apply to what I need, and he said I yelled at him. I will definitely post my comments online to share with everyone. Hope this experience could help you guys in some ways.<//text>

Very helpful over the phone. Friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you for answering your phone Ive been trying to get ahold of summerwinds nursery for several days and they aren't answering phones eventhough they're open.  they want you to come to the store or email about your order online.
I'm so happy Almaden nursery answered now i don't have to risk going into a store and catching covid19.

< Review>
Once we moved to the area we started looking for a local nursery first. And we couldn't have been more happy with Almaden Valley. They have a phenomenal collection of everything you can think of. Also their gift shop has everything else you need outside the garden. Very helpful nice people. And cute little kitties that roam around and accompany you when you're picking your plants. Love this place< /Review>

Good nursery with a decent variety of plants to choose from. The staff is friendly, when you can find someone to help you. Plants come with warranty: I purchased a plant here and six months later, it was looking very sad. I brought the plant back (or what was left of it) and they gave me a new one. Tends to be more expensive than the big box stores, but the plants are healthier and better looking too.</review>

<review>They always seem to have plants I've never seen before.  Also, the garden accessories/gifts are well priced and high quality.  For me it's worth paying a little extra to have such a great resource close to home!  Helpful, knowledgeable staff of all ages.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Good selection of plants and trees, though very pricey. I paid $60 for a fig tree. A week later I was at the Orchard store near where I live, and the Orchard store had the fig tree for 25 bucks. This place is a ripoff.

If you are a local small business and want to compete with the big box stores, your pricing should be competitive. Your business overhead should not be as high as those of big box stores.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I am a frequent customer to the Almaden Valley Nursery.  They high-quality plants and products.  The staff is very helpful.  In my experience, when one cannot answer a question, they find another staff person with the expertise.  In addition to plants, I now spend as much on the wonderful gift items available as you enter the store.  If you have shopped at the boutique at, for example, the Roberstville Carwash, then you need to try the AVN.  Jeni manages the gift shop.  There is a wonderful selection there of holiday decorations and handmade jewelry.  Additionally, if you are in to CA Native Plants (I am), you get a 10% discount if you show your CNPS membership card.  I special order native plants and they are delivered and sold at the same price of the nursery stock. I recommend the AV Nursery.<//review>

<text>We arrived in the afternoon to place a to go order. It was about 2:30pm. When I approached the counter to order, the person working said, "I am currently working on a big order, so I cant help you right now" if you want you can wait for a long time or come back later" that was very rude!</text>< user_name>

<text>(Translated by Google) Excellent food and very good treatment, quiet place to enjoy good food with friends and family. In my vicita I tried the tripe tacos, by the way, very well cooked as I like them and my companions asked for tostilocos and bionics to taste .. The price is reasonable and affordable ..

(Translated by Google) HORRIBLE!! Mister super bad service! The lady who was making the food and he passed it on the phone, as they did not feel like attending with a super bad attitude.
My brother and I got out of there super annoyed

Great food. I'd give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Only thing I thought was odd was that they allow service animals on the patio, but they're not allowed to sit in your lap.<//Text>

<text>Nice and clean place in Belmont Shore. I came on a Saturday night around 10 pm with three buddies to have a beer. Shannon’s next door was packed and loud. We had no problem sliding up to the bar’s open seats. Not sure why this place was so vacant. Our barkeep was friendly and attentive.

They have a great beer selection on tap. I got a few tastes until I settled on an IPA. My buddy had the Sliders with fries. He said it was really good. They have a nice patio and I assume it’s dog friendly. I’ll have to bring my little buddy next time.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Out on the town in the middle of the day and during the week. What a better place to eat at then in Long Beach were you can enjoy the fresh air and no crowds because everyones at work. We stoped by this place to grab something to eat. It was a very nice day so we decided to sit outside. Staff was very nice and very helpful when looking over the menu.

Jalapeño Cream Cheese Burger - Fresh jalapeño, cream cheese, grilled onions, Roma tomato, green leaf and dressing. The meat was cooked medium and was nice and juicy. The Jalapeño added a little saddle heat while the cream cheese cooled everything down. It was a nice burger and would definitely get it again. With this burger I got some tots and you can never go wrong with tater tots. The tots were Crispy on the outside and soft and mushy on the inside.

Great location, atmosphere and ambiance, It's always good to enjoy the day outside when it's such a nice day. A good burger and a cold beer makes it a great day. Stay hungry my friends!< /Review><date>1559853700999</date></record>

Some of the awesome servers just add to the comfortable and welcoming vibe.  There are good specials, like Pizza Night and Pint Night. Several specialty pizzas like Grilled and Arugalla are just a couple of my favorites.

This place has fantastic food and great happy hour specials. However the service is severely lacking. They are good at getting a drink order right away but if you want food, or your bill expect to wait quite a while. On my last visit after being ignored for over half hour I managed to get my check and then went elsewhere to eat since they didn't seem to want to have me order a dinner there</Text>

<Review>Enjoy this place, been a few times now. The food is great, and the happy hour specials are pretty good, too. This last time the bar tender wasn't very pleasant, and the service was a little slower than usual, but I'm more inclined to chalk it up to an off day, versus the norm, because I've never had the issue before.< /Review><time>1534881540062</time><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

My daughter and I came after a day paddleboarding. Food was nothing special. Had the fish and chips and salad with goat cheese and a beer. The day we went they ran out of clean silverware, had to wait for a fork to eat our salad, good thing we had fish, we could pick up with our fingers. There is outside seating,  bar seating and booth seating. Some tables  next to the window. Beer selection was limited,  menu small. If I am in the area, would probably visit again, perhaps if they add strawberries to the salad and choose  a slightly sweeter vinaigrette for the salad, would be quite yummy.< /review>

An awesome place to grab some food and people watch for a while.
The staff is always super friendly and the service has always been great.
The food is really good, no matter what you order.
Oh
And the bottomless mimosas are pretty cool too.<//text>

Also offer daily specials. I really enjoy their pizzas and their prime rib dip (with tater tots).< /text><time>1514867244701<//time><Name>Anna Horner<//Name>< Resp>

< review>
My wife and I love this place! We have enjoyed Riley's for quite some time, and now we get to bring our baby girl to enjoy everything we have come to love of this place. The staff has always been great, very friendly and well informed. Shout out to the Chef!! The food is always on point!! If I lived near by, I would be here every other day. 😁 until next time, may it be schooner than later. 🍻< /review>

Great area!  Thoughtful beer selection, friendly service and very good food.  The French fries were perfectly cooked and the veggie burger was well done!  Vegetarian choices, reasonablye prices, and good beer will encourage us to return another day!< /review>

<text>Never fails to meet my expectations, except maybe on Sundays during brunch. Really hard to get in that time. Food is always excellent, the beers on tap are always cold when in the schooner! Parking is spotty depending on when you go. But the girls there are on point and keep your glasses full! I'd recommend the Saturday brunch!< /text>< pictures>

Clean, comfy, relaxed. Best place to relax and watch a game, without fearing the predatory ambience so prevalent at other neighboring establishments.

Great Camp, well structured. I like that they divide players by skill, not age. Good coach/player ratio. Had my son and daughter attend, both had a great experience. Will continue to attend this camp.< /text>

<review>This place was amazing and my daughter loved it. The staff was amazing and so nice.  Staff chatted with me and with my daughter & were impressed that she had never in Club before. This made my daughter feel even better and was excited to learn more and improve on what she already knows. Everything you taught her on that one day made a difference and the experience was great and hope she can attend another clinic soon.   Thank you....</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

My daughter has been playing volleyball since she was 8. When we found this camp, we were excited to give her the opportunity to work with player coaches and coaches on the collegiate level and it did not disappoint. She was excited to attend each day and exhausted when she came home. The personalized coaching and evaluation of skills was a huge boost to her confidence and love of the game. Well worth it!<//text>

This is my daughters second time attending this camp.  Both times my daughter came home smiling, happy, exhausted but most of all a better player.  The staff and coaches at the camp are the best!  They are professional, kind and all around great coaches.  They evaluate the players and get to know each one of their strengths as well as weaknesses.  They work with these girls every moment of camp, teaching them everything from basic foundations to advanced skills.

If you are looking for a great camp..  look no further.  Nike Volleyball camp is the best!< /review>

< Review>
What a great experience for my daughter! Coaches were attentive, positive and best of all, she had fun. We frequent local camps and have a great club structure, but it was nice to be with a college coach and team to hear truth about moving forward.  The best thing our coach said, "If you want to play  or just be involved with volleyball in college, keep working.  There is a college out there for everyone!"<//Review>

<review>Great, well organized camp. The coaches are fantastic. Love how they teach the girls in the most effective and efficient way. They have a great communication structure set where it's clear what they need to do and work on. Stephanie was great coaching the girls and we will for sure come back again.< /review>< Pics>

<review>My daughter really enjoyed this camp. Not only did she get to play her favorite sport and improve her skills, but she also participated in a lip sync battle and enjoyed a pizza AND ice cream party. She said the food served was good. She didn’t know anyone when she went. However, she easily made friends. She said the staff was nice. The dormitory accommodations were decent. She had her own room and was supposed to share a bathroom with one girl, but that person didn’t show. Her only complaint was the “warm up” games because she was out of shape due to COVID. She recommends it.</review></record>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>This camp is definitely worth the time and money! My daughter never stopped moving and learning. They give the girls plenty of breaks throughout but they keep them going each day. It was great to have the opportunity to stay and watch, but when I couldn't, I knew she was in good hands. The staff/coaches give the girls immediate feedback as well as an overall evaluation sheet at the end of the 3 day session. This was helpful to us so we know moving forward what our daughter needs to focus more on. She had a great time during the camp and made new friends too! Overall, I would highly recommend siging up if you're looking to have your daughter work on all of her volleyball skills.<//Text><date>1626013184378< /date></record>

<review>My daughter recently attend this camp at Endicott College. She has attended previous camps for different things but this one was by far the best. She loved every minute of this camp. She said the coaches were wonderful and she learned a lot of new skills she cannot wait to share with her team mates this coming season.  She will be back next year! Thank you so much for this wonderful experience.</review>< pics>

On Sunday, June 27, 2021, my daughter attended the one-day volleyball clinic at the Lake Forest College Sports Recreation Center.

Registering for the camp online was easy, as was uploading my daughter’s medical forms.

We were given all the information needed to know what she needed to bring and what activities would take place.

The location was easy to find, in a beautiful neighborhood, and the facility was neat and clean.

The sign-in process on the day of the camp was simple, organized, and they adhered to Covid checks.

Although I didn’t stay for the 7-hour camp, my daughter said she really enjoyed herself. She told me all about the skills that were practiced and what she learned.

I would definitely recommend this camp to others.</text>

The NIKE Volleyball camp for my grand-daughters was a great camp in Houston, TX.  The coaches were excellent teachers, and the skills and drills training, and competition games were perfect for exercise and camaraderie.  The girls learned a lot and were exhausted by each day's end, so  it was all good for them.      grandma marcy< /Text>

<Text>There are so few volleyball options for a 10yo boy, interested in paying volleyball.  My son was one of the youngest at the clinic, but there were others his age, they did a great job pairing everyone where they would feel comfortable and challenged, and the guy running the camp did an incredible job.  He was highly motivational, awesome with the kids, and talked to them candidly about what the lessons of being on a team can mean for your everyday life.  It was really awesome, and my son had a wonderful time!  I wish they opened a local club team.

<review>My 15-year-old daughter had a wonderful experience at that Nike Sacred Heart camp. She gained an extensive amount of knowledge and experience and she bonded with her teammates and her coach. She is definitely going back next year. The food was great and the accommodations were comfortable. It is worth every penny.< /review></record>

My daughter truly enjoys the quick pace and high skill level. It’s absolutely clear that All the coaches LOVE to coach and share their knowledge of the sport with the campers. Their positive energy is contagious.  We love the location too, it’s tucked in a forest of trees and nature.  Truly a one of a kind camp.<//text>

<text>My daughter went to the Nike volleyball camp at Davenport University and it was an amazing experience for her. From check in to check out it was such an organized camp. The facility where she played was awesome,  the dorm was gorgeous, and of course one of her favorite things outside of volleyball training was the food! The experience and friendships that she gained there has helped so much with her self confidence on the court. The first thing she asked when I picked her up is if she could go back next year and she will be back! Thanks to Davenport University and Nike for making this an unforgettable experience for her!</text>< gmap_id>

She was younger and much less expirenced than many of the other girls and this was great exposure to an environment where she was challenged while being properly coached. She is very excited about continuing. Great life experience for a young girl. Thank you very much, and we will see you again next year!< /text>

My daughter LOVED this camp!  She said it was fast moving with lost of fun drills.  She really enjoyed all the current Webster players who were able to give her attention and help her with her form.  We will definitely be back next year!<//review>

<Review>My daughter had a wonderful time.  She really enjoyed all the court time and learned so much volleyball.  She said the coaching staff was great.
She felt very safe and the food was great.
Her only comment about what she wished was different was:  “I would take a friend to room with next time, a familiar face, vs a stranger.”</Review></record>

<Review>My 14 year old had a wonderful time at this volleyball camp where the girls actually played a LOT of volleyball. She came home sore but excited to play more and feeling more confident. She wants to do the camp for a third year next summer. The director, Tim, was especially terrific; even with a lot of girls, he took care of kids who were struggling, was very sensitive to roommate issues, and also helped out with health issues and made it feel like a small camp. Definitely recommend this camp.</Review>< Rating>

<Text>My daughter attended this camp.  Every morning she was excited to go and learn. It’s usually tough to get her up in the mornings, she would jump right out of bed and be ready to go with a smile on her face.

By far the best volleyball camp in NWA! She has attended many camps and this camped pushed her and helped her recognize what she needed to work on.

The staff was amazing!<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>My daughter had a great experience. She learned a lot - some new drills, and focused more on setting on blocking. She's a libero for her club travel team and didn't get a lot of experience with those areas this past year, so she was pleased. She also loved the beach practice. She went with about 6 girls from her team and they all enjoyed the camp and would go again if allowed. She came home sore from all the work and she enjoyed the extra training which her teammates all signed up for together. The fitness trainer specifically worked with the girls on preventing knee injuries, landing on the balls of their feet instead of their toes which puts pressure on the knees and leads to knee problems in VB players. This was really valuable for them to learn so young, only 13. So great job and thank you!!<//Text>< rate>

BY FAR....the Nike camp tops them all!   She is a upcoming Freshman at RHHS and made the school team.    She has always been a very strong server and middle back.    She called me on Day 2 of the camp and was so excited that she finally learned how to jump serve.    She also improved her skill level on blocking and hitting.  She is now the OH for her team at school.     Her coach asked her how she improved her skills in just 1 week.   She told them it was because of the Nike Camp.

The coaching staff and level of training she received was well worth the investment.    We cant wait til next summer!     I cant thank this organization enough for the refined skills and confidence they gave my daughter.

She went to this camp with 3 other girls from her Club Savannah team.  All the girls loved this camp!!

I would recommend this camp to any child that has a love of the game and is looking to refine their skills and continue playing this sport after high school.</Text>< userid>

My daughter had a great experience this summer at the Nike volleyball camp held at the University of Redlands. She said the Coaches really helped her learn to power serve and with her setting. She also learned to play the libero position with the advanced group of young ladies. This was a great confidence builder because my daughter is an intermediate player. A very positive atmosphere for the volleyball players who attended the camp.</review>

<review>Outstanding camp! Both my daughters learned a lot and had an enjoyable experience. They cant wait to go again next year. Also, one of ny daughters had to miss some camp due to an old injury that was acting up and although we did not purchase the insurance, Nike was very understanding and empathetic and allowed us to receive a credit to use at a future camp.<//review></record>

My 13 year old granddaughter had a great time at this two day camp and wished it could be longer. She learned skills, particularly her overhand serve, that she says will improve her game this coming year.</review>

My 12 year old daughter had such an amazing experience at this year’s advanced Nike Volleyball Camp  here in Las Vegas at Durango High School! She learned (and retained) so many new things! More importantly, it feels like she has been injected with an intense passion for the game. She has never been more excited about her future playing than she is right now. Thank you for everything! We will be back again and again!< /review>

We sent 2 daughters to the Nike Volleyball camp and they absolutely loved it!  Stef, her fiancé and team of coaches provided awesome coaching, training, encouragement and empowerment to a group of amazing young women!  I highly recommend the camp and Stef's leadership and team is AWESOME!< /review>

We can't wait to see you both again next year!\n\nBest,\nLiz Tellez\nNike Volleyball Camps"}</Resp><text>Best camp in CT! My daughter has attended the Nike VB Camp at SHU the last two summers. She participated in the All Skills, Position Specialty and Advanced sessions. The coaches really work hard to get to know you and help you progress with your skills to reach your potential. SHU’s volleyball players are also there to support you and are great role models of the skill, energy, effort and enthusiasm that it takes to be a next level athlete. My daughter loves this camp, from new skills and drills, to camp games and contests, and even the cafeteria food. All of this while making friendships with girls from around the country, being on SHU’s beautiful campus and playing in the amazing SHU Pitt Center. Our first summer there, we weren’t even out of the gym on the last day and my daughter was begging to return next summer. This summer she really made it clear that there is no other camp she has attended that is quite like this. She will definitely be a camper for years to come. Thank you Nike VB Camp at SHU!</text>< gmap_id>

Please stop and visit this gem. We stopped and truly enjoyed the visitors center. We stopped in for directions and enjoyed the Birds memorabilia from Alfred Hitchcock. I wish I would have got the lady's name that helped us, but she was so friendly and helped us plan out our day in Bodega Bay. We followed her suggestions and had the best day ever.</text>

Bonnie was the BEST guide. She provided us with valuable information about the area. She is extremely knowledgeable in her position and very friendly. We very much enjoyed our visit at this location.
We would highly recommend stopping at this location while you're visiting Bodega Bay.<//text>

Kara was very nice and knowledgeable about the greater area. Her knowledge was not just limited to Bodega Bay, but the entire area. Glad she was here to help guide.</Review>

The store is great in itself,  but too many Transients!  A few weeks ago a transient woman spit on our window after we asked her to stop trying to take out someone else's side mirror and today another Transient man was half naked talking all kinds of nonsense in front of the store for 25-30 minutes.... it's just sad!< /Text>

Love this place! If you come often, you can catch some AMAZING deals on name brand items! I make sure to so by a few times a week, and its cut my grocery costs by 30-50%EASILY!! The workers are very kind, too 😊My only qualm its I've had bad luck buying the fruit a few times, but other times it was great-so kind of hit and miss there!< /Review>

Overall a really great store. Has all the simple needs you needs for great price. Occasionally they bring out stuff like star wars toys and other brand toys that are really cheap.< /text>

Well stocked and lines moved very quickly and workers are very customer oriented.  One of the best .99 cent stores that I have patronized.  Only bad thing about it is that there is not a public restroom.<//review>

DO NOT SHOP HERE, AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! I bought a few items here and after the lady rang me up I looked at the receipt and figured out one of my items was 4.99. At this time I was still in the check out line. I told her I would like to return the item and she said her manager would as soon as she was done with her customer so I said ok. When the manager was done she told me she would not be able to return my money as the the cashier told me she would. Instead she offered store credit because it would take too long for the money to come back to my credit card. I said I was aware it would take while but it was ok she still persisted, so I had to leave and have my dad come in the store to speak to her. I never got my money back. And I will NEVER shop there again!< /review>

<Review>Okay, it's a 99 Cents Only Store

And yet some items are $2.99, I saw one item for $4.99. Not like the good old days when absolutely everything in the store was 99 cents. Of course that's at all 99 Cents Only Stores, not just the one in Wilmington... And to be fair, some items are less than 99 cents. This is not one of your upscale 99 Cents Only Stores... (The ones with wine, at least 3 types of olive oil and a manager with a Pavillions attitude) But this one manages to cram a whole lot into a small space and the floor staff is forever straightening up the shelves and bins disrupted by the bargain hunters. There are to be sure, some strange products: Non Dairy Creamer that clearly states "Contains Milk" and Swedish Sardines from China. But to me, that's half the fun in going to the store in the first place: never knowing what I'm going to find. I have learned over the years that if I go to the 99 cent only store because I really truly need peanut butter then for certain, they will be out of peanut butter. On the other hand if I go in with a loosely drawn up list with no definitive needs, I'm likely to find almost everything I want. This store has a very Hands-On manager who is only too eager to help you and her staff has the same attitude. Even the security guards are pleasant which is a rare sight in Wilmington. So it's tiny store, the geraniums in front are sometimes wilted, the parking lot is crazed but it's still the best 99 Cent Only store in Wilmington. In fact, it's the only 99 Cents Only Store in Wilmington, despite many imitators.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1494881428927, 'text': 'Hi John L.

Great customer service and lots of good brands to chose from for just 99 cents, and the A.C is the best not like other stores were is uncomfortable to shop.< /text>

< Review>
I come here occasionally about 2 years ago (2015) this place was unorganized, dirty bathrooms, dirty floors and the lines were always long! But I've notice in the recent couple of times through last year that all of that has been fixed. I can actually walk through and find what I need in the right spot !</Review>

Lots of good merchandise for 99 cents. You never know what you'll find there and the element of surprise makes it fun to shop there.</review>

Ruben and his team did a fantastic job on the exterior of my home. They took care of all the stucco and wood repairs, and did a beautiful job with the painting. I really appreciated the extreme attention to detail that I know most other painters would have missed. Ruben has a great eye for knowing what will look good and that was extremely helpful as well. To top it off, he was enjoyable to work with and his crew was tidy and professional. If you need a painter in the Fresno area, this is 100% the company you want to hire!</review>

<Review>All American Painting did a fantastic job on painting the interior of my house! They made sure everything was painted to perfection. The house had dark colors on the walls and a ton of nail holes in the walls; they filled all the holes and was able to cover up the dark paint so that you can't even tell that it had been painted a deep red/burgundy color. They also painted the kitchen and bathroom cabinets which came out great! Just overall a great company and one that I would definitely work with again.</Review>< gmapID>

Ruben and his crew did an excellent job.  Courteous, on time and took the time to ask us how we wanted things done.  Would recommend them in a heart beat.  Did an exterior paint job including doors that look better than factory finish, including my security screen that looks awesome.  Thank you guys!<//review>

<Text>Just had my large two story house painted by All  American Painting and I could not be more pleased. l used them in years past to paint my house and was quite happy with their work so I decided to call them back. The exterior prep-work they did was detailed and precise. It included complete stucco repairs, extensive calking and wood facing repairs. Because of the detailed prep-work, the finished paint job looks absolutely fantastic. The gentlemen on the paint crew were efficient and professional. They did top quality work and were very tidy. All American Painting was also very reasonably priced. A superior job at a great price. You can't beat that.  As a repeat customer, I definitely recommend them.<//Text>< rate>

All American painting is great! They pay attention to detail and care for your home with respect. The owner stays on top of his guys and if your unhappy with anything he is right there to correct it immediately.  The guys arrived promptly every morning and stayed late to get our job done on time. I would 100 percent recommend this company my house looks gorgeous.</text>

< Review>
If you need quality painting done in your home or business, look no further than All American Painting.  Their expertise and professionalism show in the outstanding work that they do. Each step of the painting process is done with care and dedication. Work is done on time and questions/concerns addressed promptly and respectfully.
I recently hired All American Painting to update my kitchen and laundry room cabinets.  The results are stunning. The cabinets now look new and modern. I plan on having All American freshen up the exterior of my home in the future!
Owner Ruben Gomez has years of painting experience and takes pride in his work.  Ruben and his team of knowledgeable painters will help make a beautiful transformation in your home or business.</Review>

<review>All-American Painting is hands-down THE best painting company you could ever ask for!  Ruben runs a very tight ship and it shows in the outstanding quality of work that you receive when they are finished. They just finished painting the interior and exterior of our home and it is absolutely beautiful!  It honestly looks like a brand new home!  Their lines are perfectly straight and they even did more than we had asked for ... when does a contractor do more than was agreed upon? When you hire All-American Painting - that when!  Ruben is as honest, professional, and trustworthy as they come - and so is his entire crew!!  They came on the days they said they would - and completed the work on the day they said would!  My wife and I could not be happier with the work that they did for us!  If you need some painting done then this is the company you want to hire - you'll be so happy that you did!< /review><UserId.>107472683440155037768</UserId.><Name>Danny Jensen<//Name><Time>1503696187263</Time><Gmap_id>0x80945e7c2e6a6165:0xc0f53795d45b89d< /Gmap_id>< pics>

<Text>I am very happy with the way All American Painting transformed my home, they painted my living room, dining room, kitchen, and kitchen cabinets and they look amazing, Ruben was able to give me an estimate right away and the prices were very reasonable. His team always arrived on time and ready to work, they were very professional and the work they did is amazing. I plan to to go with them again for other future projects I have and I would recommend them to anyone.<//Text>< user>

<Text>All American Painting did our house about 6 months ago.  They did a fantastic job and were very thorough. Ruben went above and beyond and was one of only 2 painters to return our phone call.  Excellent service, excellent work...highly recommend.</Text>< gmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>After interviewing many painters and being very disappointed with no shows, I found All American Painting on Google and decided to give them a try. Ruben came right out and gave me an estimate, and when he said he would call to schedule, he did. I appreciated his honestly and callback. Ruben’s team painted my kitchen walls and ceiling and they did a fabulous job! Eddie and Miguel got right to work when they got here and worked non stop until the job was finished. Great dedication and quality at a reasonable price! I plan on having them come back for my ceilings at another time, and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality painting.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We hired All American Painting to paint the interior of our home. Ruben, the owner, answered the phone personally and came out to see my home very quickly which was so nice after not being able to get return phone calls from other local painters. Ruben gave us a very professional opinion on fixing our interior paint (which was several different colors and messy) and talked us into repainting the entire house at a very fair price. After signing our contract the paint crew started in 1 week. The entire crew was very professional and clean and I felt comfortable leaving them to work on my home all week. They started on Monday and were done by Saturday. The entire process was easy start to finish and I was very, very happy with the results at my walk through! Ruben and his team of professionals did exactly what they promised and made my house look AWESOME! I would recommend them to anyone I know. Thanks All American!< /Review>

We had our home and roof painted by All American Painting. We live in Visalia and we searched for quality as well as keeping the price reasonable. The whole process was made simple and professional, after contacting All American Painting. Reuben from All American Painting took care of business and completed the job as we wanted, and he and his crew did not leave untill​ we were 100% satisfied. We were not only satisfied, we were thrilled with the masterpiece they had created. I strongly recommend these guys and I'm sure they will be used by us in the near future. Thanks again Reuben and crew for the amazing job you did.<//Review>

Interesting... They let you in without a mask on the honor system. If you've been vaccinated, you can go in without a mask.

The staff was friendly and I got to try the Taco option and even the vegetarian option. I didn't ever see the Taco option. Pretty nice.< /text>

The food is delicious, service was quick. decor, location and prices are typical for a chipotle. I reccomend the burrito bowl with barbacoa.

< Review>
Excellent customer service and wonderful food!
They gave a lots of food, more than any other location.
Even there was a long line, goes really fast, so don’t need to worry about it if you see a long line outside.
Very clean inside and have dining area outside
Highly recommended and will definitely come back!< /Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Chipotle is Chipotle taste wise. But I can only speak for the service.  This place has subpar service.  Staff is not friendly and give off an annoyed vibe.  Like they are not happy you are there.  They need to do a better job at hiring better staff.  I worked in the food service industry. I speak from experience they can do better. I don't like to bash places and I want them to do better I real do.  But if no one says anything  they will continue to provide this low level of service.  Sorry but if you can find another location go for it.  Also they are not first responder friendly.  I ask for a discount and they said we don't do that. Which I know they do.  Then as I walked away the guy behind they counter said forget them they ain't special.<//Text><userid>104707156083023887986<//userid><time>1617764194123< /time>< pics>

<review>Positive starts for Chipotle's good tasting food, but you're better off buying it in person so you have more control over your portions. I purchased a chicken salad online for lunch today and it had less than a handful of chicken in it. Considering this isn't the first I will no longer order online.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I'm not returning...just left this location. They are clearly understaffed. The ice machine was broken and the staff didn't look motivated to correct it when another Customer let them know after buying their beverages. I waited an additional 30min past my pick up time for my online order just to get home and see they left out my quesadilla. I have only a container with sides...smh. never again.</Review>

Food I'm sure is the same as normal Chipotle food. Not a fan of having to wait around 30 minutes or so after the pickup time for an online order. This after being informed I was there.</review>

One star for the consistently incorrect orders. I wish I had other options but sadly this location is the closest to me.
Every single time my wife and I order from them our orders are incorrect, even though the stickers on top clearly state our orders.
As much as i want to continue supporting businesses throughout this pandemic I am seriously considering boycotting this location for the consistently incompetent service. I genuinely hate giving bad reviews but tonight is the 5th time we have received bowls with 3 or more missing items.< /Text>

Chipotle is chipotle. The people here are generally very nice and helpful. The food is consistent. The only thing that can be frustrating is how fast the servers try to move, especially if it's busy. Before I can say "easy on the hot salsa" they've thrown an entire scoop on my bowl.</text>

<Text>From time to time when we go out at least once a month we go and have food over here. As usual we went out with a couple of friends and decided to go eat here. They had a bit of a wait but We were seated fairly quickly. We enjoyed our drinks and it did not take too long for our food to come. As usual it was good and we have a good time sitting there and talkin. The wait staff is fairly attentive even though that they were busy. We will definitely come back again.</Text>< name>

<text>I HAVEN'T EATEN AT THIS LOCATION, NOR WILL I EVER!!!

THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE WAS SOOOOOO RUDE, HE WAS UTTERLY INEPT TO TAKE AN ORDER FOR PICK UP!!

THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT IT ALL, IS THAT HOW CAN YOU PLACE AN ORDER FOR PICK UP OR DELIVERY IF YOU'RE PAYING CASH??? REALLY WTH?? MONEY IS MONEY & OBVIOUSLY HAVING A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT, WELL SCREW THAT, I PAY IN CASH PERIOD!!

ESTABLISHMENTS AS SUCH WILL NOT GET MY BUSINESS OR WHOMEVER I SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH RE THIS CHIPOTLE!!

ALSO, PROBABLY GOOD IDEA TO CHANGE THE RECORDED MESSAGE WHILE YOUR ON HOLD ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE ABILITY TO PLACE ORDER ONLY FOR PICK UP!!! I HOPE YOU READ THIS REVIEW MR. MANAGER!! YOU HAVE SOME SERIOUS TRAINING FOR YOU & YOUR STAFF!!!

< review>
Usually it’s one the best locations but last few times my food was made awfully maybe due to new staff. I received 2 tablespoons worth of rice and everything was not added proportionality. I had to ask either for more or less ingredients because it seemed like employees were making it to their liking vs. Chipotle’s standards and customer’s request. All in all I had half empty burrito with barely any rice beans and chicken and excess of sauces which turned it to soup.</review>

Good quality and fast service separates and sets them far above the other fast foods. If not crowded, you can be sitting down and eating your food within 3 minutes of entering the store and that is record-breaking. For those who haven't been there, give it a try.< /Review>< pics>

From time to time when we go out at least once a month we go and have food over here. As usual we went out with a couple of friends and decided to go eat here. They had a bit of a wait but We were seated fairly quickly. We enjoyed our drinks and it did not take too long for our food to come. As usual it was good and we have a good time sitting there and talkin. The wait staff is fairly attentive even though that they were busy. We will definitely come back again.< /text>

The one thing, however, that this particular location has never gotten right for me are my online orders. There are always missing ingredients and, on my latest pick up, they forgot the fruit and apple juice for my kid. I understand I should check things before leaving, but it'd be nice to get the right order just once. TL;DR - Good for dining in. Pick another location for your online order.</Text>< response>

I got take out from there recently and I got home and the food was cold! I hadn't waited long before I ate the food but I have to admit, I was disappointed. I wanted to eat a nice, warm burrito, but it was cold. But after I warmed it up it tasted wonderful and I would definetly go there again.

<Review>This Chipotle has gone downhill over the years.. The staff is not nearly as friendly as they have been in the past, they are always out of product, last night they were out of small cups for kids meals, the lemonade was out, he said they ran out of syrup earlier in the day but they never even covered it up, they were way behind on orders, they stopped taking orders in line at 1 point and let that build up since the line for mobile orders was backing up with people waiting.. there was just no fluidity to the process as you see at so many other Chipotle restaurants.< /Review>< pics>

Don't bother putting in your online order...this location will make you wait  to clear up orders in-store before getting to yours. THIS MAKES NO SENSE, especially when l placed the order online WELL IN ADVANCE to be courteous. My order was not ready when I got there. I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to be exact, to get my order. At that point, l should have gotten a free burrito for waiting...so disappointed.< /Text>

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Do not go here. Worse customer service in natomas. Went in at 7:00 PM. Only 1 person in the restaurant and 1 person ordering. I was literally in line when they received either an online order or a call in order.  While in line. The cashier brought the tickets to the guy making the food and handed him tickets 4 or 5. Again I had been standing in front if him prior to the tickets being delivered. He looked at me and said I will be right with you after I make these orders. Seriously I have been standing here before that order was even presented so why wouldn't you make my single order first since obviously I was here already and there is literally no one here.

Again avoid this place no wonder no one visits this location. Perhaps customer service training is needed because it is seriously lacking. Worse experience ever.</review>

Unfortunately, when I was here they prioritized online orders, even when the line was out the door. They should be trying to minimize the number of people in their restaurant during COVID-19, instead the line was long when I arrived and even longer when I left!<//Review>

I ordered a big online meal at the last minute on a very busy lunch hour at Chipotle on Truxle. They made a few mistakes but when I came back to replace a burrito ALL the staff was friendly, apologetic and even offered me a beverage while I waited for my replacement burrito. The manager came out and also apologized. I was really impressed with how well they handled their mistake and I will happily go back :)<//Text>

For the last 4 years we've been spending our Halloween night at this Chipotle. Tonight they were busy as expected and in this case, we had to wait a few minutes for the steak to be ready.  Both the workers and I believe the manager made sure to take care of us by offering us drinks while we waited.  The manager then personally made sure that our order was correct. We left very happy from our local chipotle!< /Text>

No customers and no time to clean tables. I'm sitting on the only clean one. Got charged for guacamole and not even got half of the normal amount. Still had over an hour before closing and it looks like they didn't want to take our more ingredients. All four crew members just talking.</text>

Each time I visit, it gets worse and worse.  Last time I was there, I threw away almost my whole burrito bowl.  The rice was mushy and gummy, there was so much water from the corn salsa tossed in, it was runny mixed in with the sour cream   Plus, when I order in the app, it's either not ready when I get there, or the order is wrong, or both.  I hope they do something to improve this store.<//review>

<Review>Ordered online using the app.  Won't do that again.  The food was ready at the time it indicated, but it was cold (except my tortilla, that was warm).  The carne asada wasn't cut thoroughly and was fatty.  Overall a very sad, pathetic experience.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Usually love this location, but tonight was pretty bad. I ordered online, but after waiting on fajitas and seeing the dirty hot bins stacked high on the counter on the chopping block and the lackluster staff, among many other things, I cancelled my order. The manager was only professionally polite as she could muster, but she was irritated, I could tell. Won't be coming back. Too bad.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< user_name>

<Text>They refused to make my order based off of the time frame they closed. I order food at 9:00 PM. I have worked for Chipotle for a year and a half and know they should make the food on order. All about customer service aye? No. If chiptole is out of their normal food items it is required to make the food before closing time. I understand this is annoying but as a paying customer I except this to be Avaible based off the menu. Thanks<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

I like the standard fare at Chipotle. The rice, the beans, and now they have tofu as well. The chips are a bit oily but do have a good flavor. Given the amount of food that you get I think the price is reasonable<//review>

Good food in a decent location in Sacramento (right by freeway and Walmart).  Good seating and parking.  Always busy.  Only (small) issue is that you have to ask for salt; they won't leave the salt shakers out with the condiments because customers keep taking them.  Overall, good cuisine for a good price.< /review>

The staff was great. I ordered my food online on the Chipotle site. My food was exactly how I ordered it and I just walked in went up to the cash register gave him my name and I gave you my food. I also prepaid online so that way I didn't have to pay when I got there< /review>

<name>Richard Doerflein< /name><review>Visited for lunch. Moderately busy at noon. The servers were polite and competent. The serving bar looked clean and the ingredients were fresh. My complaint is that there is to much of each added ingredient i.e. beans, rice, etc. in proportion to the amount of meat in the chicken burrito i ordered. This meant the chicken taste was lost to the supporting ingrediants. A little more meat and smaller portions of additional ingredients would be the fix. I ate lunch here with my daughter. She likes the place (orders the chicken bowl) i'm not a big fan.</review></record>

So I stopped going to Chipotle after the samanila scare. They just don't do any portion control, the person in front of me got like twice as much meat than I did I asked for more and the server asked if I wanted to pay for extra meat, of course I said no. I told the cashier and was told that your at the mercy of the server. So I am done with this f uped place.<//review>

Not a place to go if you like hot food.  They ran out of syrup for coke, that is like running out of cups or napkins.</text>

My bowl wasn't even half full, I asked for a salad and they gave barely any lettuce. The lettuce I did get was the core of the head of the lettuce. The people didn't tell the cooks when they were running out either so I had to wait for some Fajitas, rice, and mild salsa.< /Review>

<Text>Only receiving two stars because it’s Chipotle and you can’t really mess that up, but man was the service bad. Would never step foot in this location again after what I experienced today. The first girl working who asks you what your having was a young Indian girl who’s hair was all in her face which she continued to push out of her face WITH HER GLOVES ON THAT SHE WAS USING TO TOUCH MY FOOD! She also kept messing with her hat. I should have walked out right then. If an employee has enough nerve to commit a health code violation in front of me what do you think they do in the back? So grossed out.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Tortilla was rock hard, meat was rubbery. Normally Chipotle is good, but avoid this location at all costs.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809ad638eba5eb45:0x5ea247ce7be8b267< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My friend n I have eaten at other Chipotle restaurants and this is by far the worst in flavor.  Nothing was flavorful.  Very disappointed.  Beans appeared to be only boiled n no seasoning added.  Even the salsas were lacking flavor.<//Text>

How they put the gloves on is disgusting. Also as far as cashier's go, they can't do simple first grade math. I mean, what is 25 minus 7? Really? How dumb you have to be and look trashy to get hired at this place? Piercings in the nose with a huge ring? Really?</review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I usually love this place, but I had the worse experience at Chipotle today. They have a line of like 15 customers , and like 5 ppl working the line. They are rushing customers through the line. The lettuce was very wilted, I barely got any cheese, and they forgot to put my side of guac in my bag.The tortilla I got on the side was so crispy that I couldn't even eat it. My burrito bowl was horrible and not very fresh. My chips tasted very plain. Chipotle is becoming trash.</Text>< Date>

< review>
Even after the whole chipotles episode with E-coli. This place has yet to get it together. Food Is being under cooked. Brought a bowl home about three weeks ago, rice was crunchy, yesterday I went to get a bowl , bit into it and the shredded pork was cold. Lucky I was eating there. So I brought the bowl to the counter and just got a refund. The lady check there cold pork. She just let it warm up. Never changed it out. I had to write this review because you shouldn't give under cooked food to anybody. As far as I'm concerned chipotle has no room for excuses.</review>

I think this location is trying to cut its costs or something. The chips are terrible - none of the signature chipotle lime  salt. We've been coming here for almost a year and we've had these experiences every time. You barely get any rice or cheese. My husband got a quesarito the other day and they charged an extra $4 and it barely even had any cheese on it. $4 for that. They are usually out if something - forks, Tabasco, tooth picks, etc. We'll be going a bit farther to the downtown location from now on.</Review>

Worst Chipotle I ever visited on 8/06/16, and I've been to many throughout LA. Ordered a quesadilla and it barely had any meat. It was beef which costs the most like $8. Might as well have ordered a burrito and could've actually had enough to eat. Cashier told me I had to cut my quesadilla. How the F am I going to cut it myself? A big floppy piece of food cut on top of foil with a plastic knife? The foil will rip.. It goes through and touches the table, that's not sanitary. Maybe that was a new policy that was recent at that time, not sure, but I've never heard that before from any other Chipotle. I normally never ever complain unless it's that bad. Cashier offered me a little cup of beef that I could add myself to my quesadilla. Talked to the manager about everything and of course she tried to buy me off with free coupons. She looked almost like a kid in high school, didn't seem to know how to handle it. I didn't care about the mishap as much as what was troubling me was all the employees apathetic attitude, no one cared or seemed to desire improvement. If this wasn't a corporate eatery in a busy mall, any restaurant like that would fail miserably. No one wants to pay for horrid service/product. Getting tired of Chipotle in general to be honest, they don't seem to care about customer concerns. I once chipped my tooth on an avocado stem from guacamole and they were supposed to call me back but never did. When there's a new chain that's gmo free, i will switch and never come back. Shameful, really bad business practice. Goto any other location but this one.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Something delayed the service not so much but if it lacks a little more customer service and less to be playing during working hours.

Algo tardado el servicio no tanto pero si falta un poco más de servicio al cliente y menos de estar jugando en horas de trabajo.<//review>
