<Rate>5</Rate><review>Best place to buy RV they are fair people
And they give you a fair trade in value.
Very happy highly recommended

Best it all the propane tanks and start kit is part of the deal
No like other places they sell you the same kit for 1000+ .....
If you want to trade or buy new RV best place
Devin did a great job at finding was right for me!! Very happy with my entire purchase experience<//review>< Pictures>

Theses guys are awesome. We looked all over for the best RV for the right price and they are it for sure!
We worked with Gregg who was knowledgable,  friendly,  and patient with us. Everyone there has a smile and greets you with respect. While there a return customer who was dumping their trailer came over and told us he bought many rvs from them and have never had better service. Told us the parts department is the best around.<//text>

I really like the salesmen Dwayne. He didn't pressure me and he showed me the RV said he knew I was interested in. Duane's appearance was extremely professional. I would definitely consider buying my first RV from Magic Touch<//review>

If you want great customer service, go to Magic RV. Devon has been more than gracious in the time he has spent with us. His customer service goes above and beyond! Great prices and much better than the larger companies around the Central Valley. You won't be disappointed. Huge selection.< /review>

Great place to buy an RV.  Low pressure and great prices.  My friends and myself have had problems getting good service for warranty work.  Mine is in again.  I'm hoping I have a better experience than last time.</Text>

<Text>I had previously picked up some parts and supplies at this shop, because it is close to my central California base. I'm a touring musician and tour in my motorhome full time, so I have had work done, as needed all over the United States. In this case, I called from the road more than two weeks out, to see if they could handle some warranty repairs, and then, about a week out, another issue came up, so I added that to the list of repairs. I dropped it off at opening time, on a Monday morning as instructed. On Thursday, I needed something out of the unit, so stopped by, to find that so far, NOTHING had been done. When I asked why, the reply was "When do you need it by?" I reiterated that I had a drop dead deadline the following Tuesday. Stopped in again on Monday, the work was still not completed, and the service manager was quite dismissive about my concerns. Got a call on Tuesday, was told the unit was ready, and I went first to look, and the electric step which was to be repaired did operate, but slowly, making metal on metal noise. So I asked the manager about it, and he said "Might need to be lubed, or the motor might be going out" "Really?" I said. Now, you'd think, on a warranty repair, they would want to take care of that. But instead, he charged me 95.00 for putting two wires together that had come loose. I got it back to my base 20 miles away, went on with my day, and early in the evening, opened the door, and lubed the step, went to close the door, and the step remained out. Called in. Was told to bring it in first thing in the morning. The next exchange with the service manager was priceless: "We have a problem, the step worked twice, now it is stuck "out" His reply" "Not my problem" "Really? No it is, because I paid you to fix it"I said. "It worked when you left here, so it's your problem now" I crawled under the unit to undo the bungee cord holding the step up, and asked "Is this joint and pin supposed to be hanging loose?" and without looking at it, he replied "yes" Another repair person came out and offered to take a look, and he happily put things back together, and I gladly tipped him for his time. I will NEVER go back to Magic Touch RV in Tulare, unless I learn that the surly, ill mannered service manager there is no longer there. It seems to be a family business, and I wanted to have work done locally, but I will NOT go back there.<//Text>< Rating>

I went interested in buying, but no one came out to help, but it was sprinkling so maybe that's why no one came out, sorry can't give a rating<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Recently buying an RV from Magic Touch in Tulare was one of the biggest, most costly mistakes of my life! They "advertise" they have "service", but that's as close as we ever got to getting an unbelievable list of undisclosed problems taken care of in 6 months of trying!  We were sold the worlds' biggest lemon!

If I told my story, it would be a book so just read Juni Fischer's comments and make them ditto x10 for us!

Forget buying Local!  Drive to Fresno or Bakersfield and you'll be Very Lucky you did!</Review>< Gmap_id>

Every year for the last 30 years we have purchased ornaments for our grandchildren,  this year was no exception,  the selection is exceptional & service is great !!! The only reason I  can't give them 5 stars is the high price   ! I'll be back  !<//Review>

I've had pleasant experiences overall and good customer service.  However, yesterday must have been an off day.  I was bullied by another customer who was very pushy, forcing me to retreat to another part of the store.  She took the time to find me and bully me before paying for her items.  She had a good laugh with the clerks about how she approached me & insulted me. When I came to the counter to pay, she was still there and I was met with silence.  It was very uncomfortable.  I noticed the bully staring at my military ID in my wallet during my transaction.  (I am a retired, disabled, minority vet).  The staff and bully seemed to know each other well.  It must be that "hometown" thing where new people are excluded.  I took the high road by ignoring the bully, paid for my purchases, and left the store.
I've been offered a military discount once from another clerk who told me to ask for it.  I've been hesitant to do so because of attitudes from other customers.  There doesn't seem to be a constant standard when it comes to this service.  It will be a long time until I return to this store.< /Text>

This school isn't that fun tbh. Unless you hang with people you like. But fr though. It's annoying hearing people say the N word with the hard er all the time like gtfo. Y'all ugly and it's rude. And when it gets brought up seriously nothing happens so that's fusterating.  Also some teacher's are very rude and disrespectful like if your not gonna have a good attitude then leave. Don't be mad if a student talks back because you are coming at them in a rude way. Anyways other than that the clubs are fun.</text>

<rate>3</rate><text>Chaparral High School teachings are excellent but the reason why I gave a 3 star is because of how dirty the school is. Walking around campus it's absolutely horrible!  I could compare a used mop and say the mop is way cleaner than this school. I wished chs would use their funds wisely on effective things such as cleaning up the school and more equipment for other classes but nope lets spend on this "Keep It Classy" sign. Also lets not forget about the big tablet looking thing around campus,  it's just installed in the school to make it look "nice" nobody really looks at it. Wow the trees are so nice! Not at all if you look at one of the tree near the Spanish buildings you will see this "gum tree" made by students. I question myself why it will never be scraped, perhaps maybe chap is okay with that?  Well in the end,  I hope CHS in the future would look like a beautiful school to always walk in! <3 Right now in 2015-2016 it's exactly a replica of a prison, dirty and full of inmates .We Pumas don't want that or maybe it's a secret the school planned? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Well Chap..I've Revealed You! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</text>< pictures>

<Text>This school honestly isn't bad... People that say that chaparral is a bad school have not attended nor seen a bad school. The teachers here are pretty great I've learned at this school way more then any other. All of you saying this is a bad school, It's unhygienic, and things such as those don't know what you're saying. The only reason I gave this school 4 stars is because there is a couple kids doing drugs...< /Text>< Pics>

This school sucks they do not let you pick your second semester electives and i requested to change and they would not let me because they suck eggs. Also, the teachers are old hags. and they also suck eggs.

Reason: Aggressive Students, Strict teachers loud voices, Less boy bathrooms, freshman haters, girls rolling eyes, arrogant people, bullies, lunch line cutters,  Arguing students & teachers, peer pressure,  . At least their were somethings that were good like the clubs, the application choices. LGBT community allotment is okay... (Im not lesbian or gay or anything.

<Review>Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."

First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
– "Yo, home to Bel-Air."

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air< /Review>< Time>

< Review>
Staff is typically unhelpful when it comes to students needs. My schedule was switched halfway through the school year and I got a new spanish teacher. They did this without notifying me to see if it was OK. I ended up with the worst teacher for Spanish and was close to failing within 1 month of having this teacher. I asked if I could switch back to my 1st semester schedule and they refused. They also offered me no other alternatives</Review>

No wonder USPS is a dying company, my husband and I have been waiting for this package to come since Monday. I know it takes time, both my husband had been home since 10 am this morning waiting for the Package to arrive today given with the tracking number saying “out for delivery”. These mail drivers must be very incompetent to ring a DAMN Door Bell. The gentleman we spoke with told us that he doesn’t believe that the gentleman whom delivered our mail by the name of Guchyzhou (if he could have legible hand writing) wouldn’t have taken the time to write the “sorry we missed you while you were out” letter... calling us liars bout being home. I do not understand how the mailman couldn’t have just SIMPLY RANG THE DOOR BELL, we have a dog as well whom alerts us when someone is at the door. Now we have to WASTE GAS MONEY JUST TO GET OUR PACKAGE BECAUSE SOMEONE AT THIS POSTAL SERVICE CANNOT SIMPLY RANG A DAMN DOOR BELL... incompetent workers we have working with the United States Postal Service.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

After being turned away from and given erroneous information and incompetent service at the Midway post office, the 2 clerks at the Austin post office were very helpful and competent. The young man was very helpful over the phone, and the lady accepted the chickens, and sent them off. She even offered me tape that another customer had left behind, so that I was able to tape 2 boxes together so as to reduce shipping costs. I wish I had gotten their names.

This is most friendly and efficient post Office I have ever used in my 60 years of being on this earth. They are very personal and treat you like you are a friend. I have never had a bad experience with them and my mail carrier is the Greatest, keep up the great work😊<//Text>

< Review>
This review is targeted towards the exterior conditions of this facility. There always seems to be trash in the parking lot and near the doors, in the bushes fronting Austin Drive etc. Weeds that have grown close to waist height on the property is sad. There currently is graffiti on one of the exterior walls fronting Sweetwater Springs Blvd. that has been there for over a month. At one point last year a banner hung in the window notified visitors to upcoming landscape work. A couple months after nothing happened, the banner quietly disappeared with no changes at all. Now with the Sweetwater Village Center across from the PO being torn down, the PO will have the distinct award of being the worst property in the area. I’m hoping that the manager of this property will be able to at least get the weeds removed and turn on the irrigation once in awhile.<//Review>

<Text>I do not understand how you can drop packages off at 0830 A.M. when the post office first opens. Then you check tracking and it is 2215 P.M. before they are actually accepted. If you sell on line and use the USPS on Austin drive this occur's quite often. If you drive to Lemon Grove USPS, a much longer drive, they check in as accepted with in the hour. What is the problem on Austin Drive. Certain site you sell on have a policy of shipping with  in 24 hours. Is it leadership ?</Text>< username>

nice staff but unorganized and lost my package after it was stopped to redeliver to the right address, after they failed to deliver and contact me back they decided to inform me they couldn't redeliver it to me and I would have to drive back to a post office 35 min away from me twice to get something that should've been there the first time since it had been stopped in transit.< /Review>

This is a pretty good post office. The wait times are quite reasonable and the counter staff are pleasant and helpful. I may yet have a bad experience but so far it has all been good.</Review>

Even the customer service  representative said the second time I called that someone here is messing up the shipping process smh , worst post office in  California don’t go to them unless you want your stuff stolen< /review>< rating>

Called this location about a package that I did not receive that was tracked as delivered to a community parcel locker. I spoke to Ben who offered to speak to the carrier and personally come out to see if the key was left and  if it was there or not. I ended up receiving the package. Was awesome customer service by Ben. I really appreciated the help! Thanks<//review>

Just moved to the area and have used this location many times. I've never experienced long lines/wait times. Staff are friendly and professional. I like how the doors automatically open for you in case you have packages in your hands. Priority shipping materials are always fully stocked. It's also very convenient they have Saturday hours. I will continue to use this post office for my shipping needs!< /review>

<review>I've had excellent service in the actual office.  The mail carrier though....  Just in the last few months we've had a change in carriers.  The previous carrier was very nice and we never had an issue with her.  This one though.  Oh my.  I've been home home on two occasions when the mail was delivered so I can't say what goes on when I'm not here but judging from these two instances it does not look good.  The first time I heard a big BANG as a package hit the front door and then the door bell.  She actually threw the package at the door!  Very NOT happy.  The second occasion I was actually on vacation and was enjoying the very infrequent rain.  I heard a noise and looked up at the window to the porch area from where I was sitting in the den and saw as well as heard the package hit the window.  I went out to the porch and and some of my statues had actually been knocked down by the package being thrown into the planter box under the window.  Again, what the hell?  Why the need to throw???<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80d95a6e122ef969:0xc2f612ae664754ac</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Rudeness knows no bounds. Two guys behind the counter great, manager, a man with white hair talked down to my dear mother and I like dogs. Maybe because we are women, maybe because we are black. Not sure. Either way, unless you want to be disrespected over the most trivial matters, such as mail, by a man with an EXTREME power complexion, then go to this post office. Otherwise, GO TO A DIFFERENT OFFICE!!!</review>

I wish I could say good things about this place but I just cant.Not only are the people inside extremely rude, the mailman for our route doesn't bother delivering packages. He just throws the "we missed you" slip in the mailbox. I know because I've been home during his delivery time, which is also late, expecting a package. I leave the door open most of the day and when I walk out to see if he came the mail is there along with that yellow slip. What service.< /Review>

Asian man behind counter at this post office always very rude. It's like why are you there if you have no custom service skills. He should just be delivering mail instead or something else. I really hope the post office private.  That guy would not be working there for sure.<//Review>

Worst postal service in California. Failed to deliver a package and sent back to sender making it a 4 month process. Do not trust or expect good service, the manager has memory loss and no one knows how to do their job, replace the employees.<//Review>

< Review>
I have not received any mail for 3 weeks . When I called it was told they would send someone with my mail they never showed up. Like another guy said they are not accountable for their actions.  They are quick to blame you .
Another incident I went down there told them that they had been holding on to one of my packages they told me no they haven't even called the company that sent the package they told me that yes according to the tracking number it was at that post office . I go back in and they tell me oh well we just found it.
Unfortunately even with all the negative reviews and having a 3 for a rating nothing will be done.<//Review>

This is the third time in the last three weeks the driver did not stop to pick up outgoing mail.My box sits right on the street & there are 3 other mail boxes next to mine. I phoned the post office and was told that they don,t always stop for the flag on the box.I find it hard to believe that all four boxes have no mail delivery.</Text>

Never been inside Post Office just know that on 9/6/12 sat and watched post man take flag down toss over his shoulders and drag across parking lot, then just toss it in the back of his mail truck. Called and notified them about what I saw and basically was blown off.<//Review>

Worst post office ive been to, they dont even deserve 1 star. I dread coming here. Don't trust your mail/packages with these people. Ive had packages stolen multiple times because of their lazy delivery person. Ive had important packages given to wrong people. Someone decided to pretend that they lived in our apartment , obviously coming from the corner of the street, and the delivery guy still believed him and let him sign, only respond i got from him was "I dont know" They don't seem to help or care when you have a situation instead they respond with "I will let them know" or "I don't know" .  Even after calling them, I had a guy answer me with the most careless and effortless tone. The people are rude and mean. Be careful with your packages when it comes to this post office, they will not care and nothing will be resolved. I don't recomend them at all!!< /Review>

This location was recommended to me and it's been my Payday loan source for 2 years now.  I want to give high reviews to Becca for her assistance in making this an amiable experience.  Her professional yet friendly attitude has made my visit a pleasant one, and has improved what could be a stressful situation.  I've seen her expedite loans on a busy day with ease and give each individual her full attention in explaining the loan process, even when she's the only person working in the office.< /Review>

To whom it may concern,

I visited this location and Stacy Hatton greeted me with a smile. I asked a lot of questions regarding the process of a payday loan and a title loan. She was very patient and informative. I was nervous and she put me at ease. She walked me through the process in getting a payday loan. She was professional and kind. The store was organized and clean. I will definitely recommend this store to my friends and coworkers.

Thank you for your time, and have a wonderful day!</text>

Came in today and I think the girls names was ally or maybe Alyssa. She was very nice and handled my check cashing very quickly. Her customer service alone will bring me back. See you guys in 2 weeks< /Review>

Rebecca is awesome!!!! She knows what shes doing and is super friendly. It's a great experience everytime i go in no matter if I'm cashing my checks or just getting my monthly money orders. Rebecca makes you feel like your family and not just some customer, I also like the fact that she always remembers my name when i go in because allot of businesses don't care enought to go that extra mile anymore. I initially came in because a friend recommended it but i have came back ever since due to the customer service and i plan on continuing to come back in the future!<//text>

<text>I got my nails done and was charged almost 200 dollars for getting fire dancer and my nails done. I was over charge and she (Lisa) did it fast so it didn't register why it cost so much. Not just that my nails were not the same size or straight.  It also came off a week later. I was on vacation so I didn't do anything to make it come off. Also, my friend who came with was supposed to get something done and we booked two weeks ahead and when we got there she told her she didn't have time now and maybe later or come back in a few hours. We literally drove over an hour to see her because we thought they would do a good job. After I got done with my nails a girl did a walk in and Lisa told her to wait 10 minutes.  Which is funny because my friend had that 2 weeks appt that she said she didn't have time for. She was charged 40 dollars to get a manicure done and 12 dollars for her brows. It's not even the right price. We were both over charge and Lisa took advantage of that because no one else was there to catch her. Shame on you.< /text><Rate>1<//Rate><response>None<//response>< pictures>

<review>I went in for an emergency dip, as I'm healing a break from a fall.

Lavender Nails over filed my natural nails, burned me several times with the e-file / nail drill, made me bleed, didn't wear both gloves, and cut my cuticles... not just unnecessarily, but also unwell. Now they look like someone chewed them off! Then, almost as if to salt the wound, the Lavender Nails nail tech used mentholated massage oil instead of cuticle oil (which smelled great, but BURNED).

I will say: The nail tech did NOT use the original container to dip out of with me, she used a small dish and brushes in what appeared to be a sterile manner. The nippers also appeared to come out of an autoclaved package. So that was good, and I appreciate that very much.

The issues I DID have with sanitation practices are that she didn't use a glove on one hand, wiped away my blood with the ungloved hand, and as I was staring at her ungloved hand in horror, I observed a substantial amount of nail fungus growing out of one of her nails. (AAAAHHHH!)

I'm not even to going to try to comprehend or explain the weird argument she tried to have with me when I tipped her at payment, despite all of this. Why did I tip anything? Well, because it took TWO HOURS to have these done, and because I appreciate the fact that she's a small business trying to stay afloat as part of our local economy through the ravages of COVID.

TL;DR:
I usually pay less than Lavender Nails charged me for a dip, to get a full set of lengthy ballerina tips, done quicker, safer, and with a soft touch at Passion Nails in Rancho Cordova. I won't be returning to Lavender Nails ever again... not even if there's a fire! Unfortunately, I guess this is what I deserve for "cheating" on my manicurist, and now I'm stuck healing, in pain, and just hoping I didn't catch anything transmissible. I could barely use my hands for days, they were so sore!! These pictures are almost a full week of healing later and they STILL hurt!!!

Go see Rachel at Passion Nails, it's worth the drive. I promise!< /review>< UserId.>

It was very nice and clean, I went for a mani/pedi and the atmosphere was fantastic. I wanted a marble look on my nails, which they weren’t able to do, instead I got glitter with flowers and it came out great! They were very attentive to doing what I wanted, and they apologized for not doing the marble.
Over all, I’d go back again.< /Review>

Was hard to park and walk to but that was the least of my concerns. Everyone was rude and the prices were ridiculous!  The lady acted like she was doing me a favor by doing my nails. I will never go back. Gel manicure chipped after one week. Asked for a gel pedicure too until she informed me that the price was 80 bucks for a pedicure!!

<Text>Very disappointed. Was sure that I made an appointment early morning for 7pm. I do this to avoid waiting. I get to my appointment on time just to wait an hour to get my manicure done. VERY unprofessional.  I feel as if my fime is not important. Especially they knew I was coming in for 7pm since 11am this morning. If you are a person that appreciates time management this is not the place. I'm just saying.<//Text>< pictures>

They use dip powder which is not safe and has loads of bacteria. All my nails were different sizes and the shape was not what I asked for or consistent I actually came home and cut all of them to make them the same size and shape< /text>

I have been coming here for about a year with my best friend and mom, we've been doing our nails for 10 years atleast and this is by far our favorite place to go. Nelson is the best nail technician I have ever had! He is so much fun to talk to and has such a great personality! He cares so much about all of his work and his customers! Also, Jason is a great pedicurist!! He is super fun and funny and (if you're ticklish beware, he will go all in with the tickling hahaha)

You guys are amazing and we love you, thank you so much for all of the time you put in with everyone! ❤</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Came here twice and will definitely come back! They are so nice and GENUINELY helpful. They have A great selection of nail polish/gel/powder colors to choose from as well as offer more services than from what I’ve seen in other nail spas. I’m very picky with the way my nails are shaped & they’ve always done an amazing job with them. I’ve had my nails done from all around California and the price here is actually really nice for the service you get. I just recently got a fill, repair,reshape, gel color and it came out to $40. And Lisa did an amazing job!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<name>Angela M Bryant<//name><Review>I came in 12/2/19 to get my nails done and a pedicure for my boyfriend. His pedicure was okay but during the manicure, He said she was “going too fast.”She cut him too short under 1 nail and cut his cuticle and made him bleed. She had to put the blue liquid on him to stop the bleeding. Not a good experience for his first manicure!
One lady (the top lady who was negotiating everything) did my feet and did a great job - no issues! The same lady who did my boyfriends mani/pedi did my nails. She did an okay job on my gel dip but one nail is extremely bumpy and she cut my skin with cuticle clippers for no reason.
For $127 I expect a better service.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

<text>Horrible service, horrible staff, horrible massage, the man did NOT know how to do a pedicure. He was cutting my skin and forgetting steps. I was insulted by being asked more than once if I could pay for something. The person doing my pedicure was just flat out rushing like he needed to go and just didnt care.

Mary took care of me during my visit, and I've never had such beautiful nails. She took her time shaping them to perfection and making sure everything looked nice and clean. She was super sweet and friendly and I highly recommend her if you want a nice relaxing experience where you know you're getting your money's worth. Love Lavender Nails. Keep up the great work, Mary!</text>

The girl who did my nail was horrid. Not only did she cut down my cuticles and make me bleed on all fingers except one (which she wasn’t supposed to do I’m the first place) she also stabbed the skin on either side of the finger. This was very painful and I shed a tear both times. My nail are almond shape and not all pointed upwards. Overall painful experience. Do not go here.</text>

<Text>First time at this spa for a pedicure and Toni did my toes. Is was the best pedicure I have ever had. He took his time and massaged my legs and feet with out rushing . Liertally took like 10 minuets for each thing he applied on my legs and feet. Other places I’ve been to apply real fast and wipe off Maybe massage 5 mjntues top.  Him and his wife Lisa are super nice and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place. I wished there were more people like them in San Jose where I live . Thank you for your excellent service. 😊<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Don't go by the prices and services on their website. They only do acrylic nails, no fiberglass or gel, and the price to get acrylics with gel polish is $40. The lady did not cut them the way I asked her to and I had to go back to get them changed because I was not able to do my job well. The polish was streaky and they did not use a base coat and only did two coats of the color. When she cut them down she buffed the color as well and put another clear coat, but that just made the streaks worse.
She tried to push me into getting a nail design, which made me uncomfortable and also kept shaking my hands to get me to relax them more which kind of ruined the experience.
Overall it's a nice looking salon and they use clean, new tools for standard polish-only manicures (what the lady thought I wanted when I said I was looking for a full-set of fake gels) but not when they do acrylics and it seems that only one or two of the technicians speak English well enough to understand what the customer wants.</review>< pics>

<Review>This place is over priced and did a terrible job. Charged me $40 for a basic pedicure and $45 for nails that are so ugly I already want to go get them text when I got them done Sunday. They are not smooth at all, they misshaped, and the rhinestones fell off the next day.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x809ae68c247fe93b:0x735d71babd5e5e49<//Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

<user_id>114063526624798180405<//user_id><text>This place is absolutely horrible. Lets just start off with my first experience here. Two of my friends and i came here for full sets. We all got acrylic. The cost of my nails was 25 plus my tip of 5 dollars so a even 30. I was the first one to sit down and get started before my other two friends and they finished before me and it literally took my Nail Tech an hour and a half to do my nails basic acrylic one color set when it usually takes about 45 to an hour. Now just recently I went back even though that experience wasn't that great just to give them a second chance I looked up there closing time at 5 and I asked if they had an opening for me to come in to get a full set their closing time was at 7 but she told me to come in at 6:30 so I was thinking I would have somebody that was quick and fast but yet again I had a horrible experience the man who was doing my nails he was very upset that he had to stay later even though they told me to come in at that time and I went home with Lumpy different sized nails and he was super rough I went home and had to file around the Edge's because I was cutting myself and pulling my hair I will never go to the salon again and I don't recommend anybody else and on top of them being lumpy and all messed up they charged me $30 even though it was the same set as my first visit that was $25<//text><gmapID>0x809ae68c247fe93b:0x735d71babd5e5e49<//gmapID>< user_name>

Then when I asked if I could stay seated next to my friend they refused. No big deal I understand I was just a little bummed. Then during my nails the whole time the lady keeps telling me to relax my finger. Like every 5 minutes the entire time. I felt like they were annoyed that we were in there late at night because the woman doing my nails seemed frustrated  the whole time and kept shaking my hand and telling me to loosen up. Like the whole time I was trying to relax and it was more stressful than not. I haven't gotten my nails done in a few months because I have been waiting to find a good place and I even explained this but there was no further effort to create a relaxing and spa like environment. I was then charged $30 for a full set which I assumed would be $25 like their webpage said so I called and they said because I got long nails. Ok. I said the same price for their Ultimate mani with the hot  oil and scrub but they didn't even do that or my cuticles. What did I pay $30 for then??

Anyways, I work hard for my money as I'm sure everyone can agree with and I believe that where I cast my dollar I cast my vote. My "treat yourself"  indulgence was more of an awkward uncomfortable situation which I now regret.

The nails are nice. They have the skill but they truly need to work on customer care/ customer service. There are places out there where you go once and you want to go back the next week because it was such an enjoyable experience. That's where you should spend your money.

If you do go here keep your fingers relaxed the entire time!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Applied online to this place on July 23rd, got a call the next day and was given a drug test screening to go to has well as an onboarding email with all the paperwork to fill out, like a background check. I go in the next day for the drug screen on a Friday, call them after its done and am told I shoild start sometime next week. The next week I call on Monday and Tuesday and keep getting a voice-mail or out of service, so I email the person handling my case and am told to sit tight. When I call Wednesday I am told that my agent Denisee Reynaga, was out sick and did not authorize my background check and is now being authorized by the person on the phone. After a week of emailing Denisee because I couldn't reach anyone with the phone number listed, I am given a runaround and told my background check is delayed because of the pandemic, even though I was told it would take 3-5 business days. It has now been 2 weeks and have still not heard from anyone and can't reach out to anyone. This agency cost me 2 weeks of work, because of the runarounds they gave me.<//Review></record>

I honestly don’t know where to start with Stephanie. Stephanie ALWAYS, has a attitude and will always give you the run around and her “coworkers” Phebe and the rest will simply back her up regardless if they are in the wrong. If you DON’T want to be valued as an employee then by all means work here. Lastly, they are late on your checks and constantly having payroll errors.Furthermore, they all have a daily office ritual of bad attitudes. You’d think since they take so much money out of your check they would be in a better mood. But unfortunately, that’s not the case. You ask them about your money and there errors and your given the run around or your calls are simply ignored by Alex (a.k.a payroll).<//Review>< GmapID>

What a pleasant and organized place. David was extremely helpful from the get go! He helped me through the hiring process and had multiple jobs available for my experience level. Come in and see for yourself.
UPDATE: I already am starting at my new job which is right in the pay range and hours I wanted! Thank you David and your associates for absolutely exceeding my expectations and giving me new life opportunities!<//Text>

<text>Osiris is one of the most helpful and outgoing people I have had the pleasure of working with. She has a great positive attitude, and has been very professional. I had interviews with  a Company quickly, that was a great match and She has done an outstanding job of keeping me informed of the process. I highly recommend the Randstad agency to any professionals looking for employment, and more precisely working with Osiris. I couldn’t be happier with her assistance !< /text></record>

I would give zero stars if I could. I applied and every time I call, they never have work or they'll put me on hold and just completely forget about me. Also I have a friend who worked for them and they were late on her check twice! Also the staff are rude when you call asking for work.< /Review>

Do not waste your time applying.
They don't answer the phone and they have my number block so i can't call them for assignments. A worker name Colby doesn't communicate with you he sent me to a job where i was being harassed because of my skin color and he blamed me for it.

< Review>
I highly recommend Randstad in the city of industry!  I had never tried a staffing agency before I applied there. And honestly there the only staffing agency I will work with. My experience was great from the beginning.  Everyone at the office was friendly and welcoming. My recruiter Madison Teodo is wonderful! She really cares, and pays attention to detail, and will do her best to find you something that is perfect for you. I'm extremely lucky and appreciative to Randstad. And there amazing staff in the city of industry, for all they have done and continue to do!< /Review>

My recruiter was very nice and helpful. I had started work quickly. I would work with them again, my only concern was we all did the same job but I was getting paid less than everyone. I said; nothing only because it was such a short assignment that was the only disappointment.< /review>

Recently moved back from Houston and within days started to work a full time job with guaranteed 40+ hours. The communication from their staff is always clear and they are always quick to call you back if you cannot reach them during business hours.  Highly recommended if you want to get your foot in the door with a good company with the potential of getting hired on permanently. Shout out to Attmar and Maria for hooking me up!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

ive been with them for 3 straight months now and i still have not been offered a job. Because OMG
if you pass on a job that is offered to you  that you dont like, they take it personal and dont help you at all after that ?!

MARIA CASTRO....i wish i could give you 0 stars...she is rude over the phone.. she doesnt offer help she tells certain people there is work and choses not to tell people like me (idk why??!) That there is nothing available ??  she rushes you off .. OSIRIS is her back up .. she lies for maria so she doesnt have to answer the phone ... your jobs is to HELP someone find a job ... how would you feel if you were in need of a job MARIA or OSIRIS?? and i brushed you off ?? Think about it before you treat someone professional .. unprofessionally ... btw most of the reviews you see on here that make them look like "the best" is because they recruit people then make people rate them. FAKE. go save your time with another agency.</review>

This place is awful, don't go. It's a waste of time. They called me in for $13.hr job, when I went in they magically didn't have the job anymore (a lot of agencies do this to drag people in) and they offered a packaging $10/hr job, so I took up the offer, filled out the paperwork and got drug tested. They called me a few days later and said I was ready to be sent in, so he told me to call for confirmation the day before I was supposed to start. He was supposed to email me the info (the address, who to check in with, etc of the warehouse) but never did. I called back several times and he said he was going to email me the info but never did. So I didn't get to start the job. I called back today to see what happened and they told me I had the wrong number and hung up when I gave them my name. I don't understand why they couldn't just tell me they couldn't place me instead of being shady? Oh well. Don't go here.< /Text>

Amazing selection from salt water to trout trolling. Prices are fair, and they often have sales or marked down products. Very knowledgable staff who actually fish, you won't always find that with other sporting good stores. I am and will continue to be a repeat customer.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I love this store.  I always find what I'm looking.  I actually drive from Sac to do my shopping here at the Fairfield store.  Everyone is hella happy to help out and full of knowledge.  Went down today to pick up an Okuna Cold Water line counter for my Stubborn Custom Rod and ended up leaving with an upgrade to my Phenix 805 striper rod with a new Diawa Lexa HD 300 with the power handle after the manager and staff sold me on the reel.  I'm excited to get out in the bay now for a due trip for some butts and stripers on some badass setups!  DONT HATE ON MY PURPS!!!  lol.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaEYqTBeY1GG_lGYmVpYie6mn6EvRGOwoP9hSN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONCuOUDCO5ccn9PFtx0ZJvawK1CQ-HqlEg2Lvr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP56jI0-v3t33wwW_Xcfv8zKIf6mjC_kyVlxPHy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< rate>

< review>
Okay, let me start with my wallet loves this store. I go here for simple items that are hard to find, even online, and the shelves are full of the item I went in for plus SO MUCH MORE. My wallet seems to just open up and empty itself every time I show up here.

It's like going to Costco for eggs, $400 later.

Thanks for getting me in trouble with my wife, and for helping me catch tons of fish.< /review>

<Text>Very bad experience I brought my reel to service I leave my reel for 4 weeks they never work on it and came back to pick up today and they lost the handle and blame me for that... that single piece costs me 100$ because they lost that. Really bad place please never go to this store or bring your staff to service<//Text>< Pictures>

One stop shop for all your fishing needs. Came in for a jigging rod and walked out with so much more. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Thanks again Nick!<//review>

Was there on Friday Aug. 30th to replace some items that were stolen from me. The guys were all very helpful and knowledgeable, bought a replacement gloomis rod and a matching curado dc reel. Thanks Fisherman's Warehouse for getting me back on the water. Here's a couple of good ole farm pond bass I was able to get. Thanks again.< /review>

Great friendly staff, very knowledgeable about fishing. Came in for the popular delta wood bomber they had 1 left in stock. I highly recommend this tackle shop for your fishing needs.< /Review>

<text>4 stars for selection, 1 star for service. My experience has been that they stand at the counter chatting with their buddy about whatever, won't ask if you need help, ignore you until you are forced to interrupt them, and then get attitude. This is the norm, I did get great help once a couple of years ago, the guy was great. Patient and helpful. That was the exception. The norm is rude. For contrasting service, try Coyote Bait & Tackle. Rude once. That was the exception. The norm is helpful and friendly.</text><user_name>Aboutreefitty Dalochnessmonsta</user_name>< gmap_id>

Purchased a rod on a Friday and two casts in one of the guides inserts came off. Took it back on monday and the wonderful Amy exchanged it for me. Great friendly people to deal with. Stay local and buy local especially with a bass pro just down the street.<//review>

Good selection but It's the same as every other fishing shop. No one wants to talk to you until you're at the check out counter. It's too bad that fishermen are crappy people persons.<//review>

<Text>After my first visit to the Cupertino store just to see their selection of bass lures (awesome by the way), I read some reviews that just did not jive with my experience, which was positive.  So I've gone back to Fisherman's Warehouse several times since in the last month or so, with each time being better than the previous.  I paid close attention to how the salespeople assisted other customers, and they were always courteous, attentive and helpful.  One example - I saw was a guy purchasing a fishing pole, but there was a discrepancy in price at the cash register.  The register said the pole was $100 less than it was marked (and it wasn't on sale- it was clearly an error), but there was no argument from the salesman and he honored the lower price, saving the customer about $100. They've definitely earned my business!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>They will tell you any BS like "if you don't like the rod, return it and exchange for another" for you into buying the rod then denying having said so.

Also bought a rod that has life time warranty and then found out the exchange over the counter charge is almost the same as buying a new rod.

The store manager's attitude is horrible, they will come up with any BS not to help.

I have shopped in lot of places in the area, Coyote Bait and Tackle, Fishery Supply, etc. By far this is the worst place any fishermen can go. Don't buy at this place, go to the Bass Pro Shop across the street and let's stinking place rot.</text><name>Cucho Pompin<//name>< UserId.>

Went in to buy 2 downriggers found the one i wanted marked at 499.99 they refused to sell me these riggers at that price ! They said it was priced wrong and refused to honor the ticketed price and were very rude about it especially the asian lady .. This is why i normally dont shop here. I am a charter boat captain and commercial fisherman . They treat people like dirt!!!! I will never return to this store!!!!!!!!</Review>

I went there several times before, and the experience is pretty nice, until one day I met the manager. There was one staff who is really helpful, and spend quite sometime to help me getting a reel, and I decided to get a shimano reel. I wanted to get some lines and leader material as well. Then the manager came by, rudely said, do you know what are you looking for, don't look around unless you know what you are buying. I initially get confused and asked for the special leader material (I didn't know the name "mono" at that time). The manager went to the counter, and showed me some mono leader, however, he hold them, don't touch it, you either buy it, or go. Then I sensed something different, the manager treats me as if I couldn't afford the 9$ leader material, while I already decided to get the shimano reel! Ridiculous. So, don't go there, until you'd like to get discriminated, or hold your hands and pray not to met this mean manager.</Text></record>

I took in a reel to be repaired.  After two weeks the repairer in Sacremento called to say that the repair would cost $100.  Its a two hundred dollar reel, Shimano Stradic 6000.  I told him that that was the line - I'd buy a new one if it cost any more.  When I went to pick the reel up the charge to fix was $170, almost as much as a new one.  They said they were giving  me a deal by not charging me labor charges!   I said that I would pay only what they told me it would cost.  They refused and kept the reel.  Wow, this is really bad service and totally bogus.  How can you not know how much it will cost to fix a reel you have open in front of you?  Why didn't they call again when they know the full cost?  They have lost a customer for life!!!</Text>

<time>1361325682234</time><rate>3<//rate><Review>"If I have a longer pool could I cast farther? Do you guys carry the neon green color fishing line? Whats the difference between these two poles I Have?" These are the questions I asked today at this store. This  is my response I get..

1. If I have a longer pole would my crab snare go further?? answer... sure I guess. I don't know. You dont need this pole. You need to buy this one.. He tells this to me in a very rude way. Not being being very helpful. I dont know why I bought it. But I did.

2. Do you guys carry  the green neon fishing line? He looks at me with a strange face as if I  don't know or am not using the correct terms so I respond with  I don't know what terms to use cause Im not a fishing pro. But would like the neon color line. Do you have it? Response.. "I think. I dont know. Its expensive though.." He points to direction to where the line is at and says "if its not there. Then thats all we have" Its expensive and something something braided line he says to me.
The owner "bald man" Just stood there and didnt give me any help or was even trying to be helpful. Maybe he was discriminating me cause I was dirty back home from a crabbing trip? I dont know. But the man had TERRIBLE customer service. I still my bought pole there. But that is the last time I ever go there again. BTW Walmarts pole is 5 bucks cheaper and the people there have so much more customer service skills and product knowledge tskills then the guy at this store.
I left that store today being very upset and just shocked with the way I was treated. CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE SUCKS FAT SAND DABBERS! KIND OF TOSSED MY CHANGE ONTO THE COUNTER. I SAID THNAK YOU . THEY SAID  NOTHING. They have a ton of items in stock. I doubt this biz will be up for long if they act like they are holier then thou. Sorry for the typos and negative remark. I hate leaving these kinds of negative feedback.. However I just woike up and Im still bitter with the way this place treated me.<//Review>< Pictures>

Diamonds Forever found two timeless diamond pieces that were simply perfect. After buying the diamond solitaire necklace with an antique historic diamond, I then needed the perfect engagement ring, and they did not disappoint; I had a custom setting and with my fiancé there to make it her dream ring. Thank you Jenny and the whole Diamonds Forever family for making my life more happy 😃<//Review>

My fiancé and I were getting married and were looking for a custom ring with a particular type of stone (black star sapphire). We called multiple places & none had heard of the type of gem we were looking for. When we called Diamonds, they had the gems! Jenny was more than helpful to us. She took her time to make sure that both of us were satisfied with our rings. Excellent service!<//review>

Jenny was awesome.  Very professional and personal throughout our picking process.   Very easy to work with and met every request!  10/10 would recommend to anyone.   Amy was amazing in meeting with my wife and giving her options that she was looking for.   This place is perfect to find that something.

Thank you guys!!!!</Text>

The amazing professionals at Diamonds Forever are the best! They love what they do, and their passion for their craft shines through!  I wanted a custom engagement ring and the staff helped me every step of the way.  It was so fun to get to design something original.  I was able to choose the setting and pick the perfect diamond to accompany it.  Jenny hand picked a few diamonds for us to choose from and we loved them all, but when my fiance and I got home we kept thinking about this one stone...we knew we had found the perfect diamond for my ring!  Thank you for making my wedding ring so so special. The ring of a lifetime!

<Text>I had been looking endlessly for the perfect diamond to attach to a ring I already had while also staying within my budget for my now fiancé. I found this store on google after going to 2 big brand stores previously who were very much pushing me to finance outside of my budget and spend more money in the long run. When I called and spoke to Jenny she was able to tell me about stone options and I came in the same day. Not only did I walk out with something in my budget but Jenny was the first person I spoke to who kept me within my budgeted price and was also helping me with ideas for future rings and a pendant. I felt really comfortable and appreciated as a person not just a dollar sign. The ring turned out amazing and I’ve already had multiple people ask where I went to get the ring done. Definitely coming here for all my future jewelry needs!< /Text>< rating>

Super honest pricing and I am absolutely in love with how beautiful it turned out. I’d recommend this lovely store to anyone looking to get engaged! Thanks so much Jenny!<//Text>

My moissanite ring from there is gorgeous! Amy & Jenny were very helpful with my fiancé picking out the ring. And then were able to size it perfectly for me in no time at all.< /text>

my husband and I have been return customers of Jenny Seligmann's Diamonds are Forever, in Point Loma, San Diego. My husband went here for my engagement ring, which is so beautiful and I love it. Then, I Went myself to find a Gold Chain for my husband, and she helped me find a very high quality chain.
Just recently I went in to the store, to go over ideas for a celebration ring my husband was going to purchase. As I wanted something different and special. The ring came and it was so beautiful. but not quite what we had discussed. Jenny wanted to remedy the situation right away. She is so helpful and caring. I know she really went above and beyond to make me happy. I continued to wear the ring my husband had purchased while she worked on the custom ring for me. When the ring was finished and presented to me, I was absolutely in love. The ring was exactly what I wanted and so stunning. In the end she bumped up the carats in the ring and the finished product is just gorgeous.
The service at this store is above and beyond. I would recommend this store to anyone looking for any jewelry piece. They have a wild variety of engagement rings, beautiful diamond earrings, and bracelets. The most impressive thing about the store is the customer service. Jenny and staff want you to be completely happy with your purchase, and experience.< /review>

< Review>
My fiancee (then boyfriend) and I came to San Diego to shop for engagement rings last April.  Jenny made an appointment with us and spent several hours not only showing us settings and stones, but explaining diamond ratings and exploring creative options for rings.  Being from out of town, she was extremely diligent in corresponding with us via email, answering our questions and helping us put together our vision.  She even helped my fiancee create a surprise by working out telling me that our rings would be shipped on a later date - I had no idea when he popped the question!  She is great!  I would highly, highly recommend working with her and had a great experience at the store.  Love!!< /Review>

<user_name>Phoenix Carlton< /user_name><Date>1591319873741</Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>Jenny and Amy of Diamonds Forever facilitated the most professional and stress free experience I could ever ask for. My fiancée wanted a very specific cut and colored spinel stone for her engagement ring. I brought pictures to Jenny and she set to the task of finding exactly what I wanted. She came back swiftly with different options of specifically what I was looking for. There is no aggressive selling or uncomfortable pushy conversations throughout the entire designing process (this was constantly an issue at different jewelry stores). I would recommend Diamonds Forever to anyone for any jewelry need. They have adjusted diamond brackets and mended broken gold chains for me since I’ve worked with them! I will never go to another jeweler.<//Text>< Pics>

I needed to know the correct size of the wedding band to order online from another jeweler  over the weekend.  Stopped by at Diamonds Forever San Diego (I Googled jewelry services in San Diego area) so my two rings that fit my fingers could be sized.  The sales person was kind and he provided the info I needed even tho I told him I stopped by for advice on ring size while I was going to order a piece from another business.  Good customer service and I will be back!</text>

Amy helped me, but both women working were helpful and professional. I was able to find a beautiful necklace for my mother with Amy's help even though I was on a budget. Their selection is pretty good, but they can also make custom pieces at prices that are very reasonable. I don't buy much jewelery since neither myself nor my girlfriend wears any, so I'm not sure when I'll get the chance to give them my business again, but I will be recommending them to anyone who wants to buy something nice for the jewelery-wearing people in their life.<//text>

Brought in a setting that needed a stone and they helped me pick one out and they set it for me as well as appraised it for insurance purposes.  On top of that they put it in a very nice box that I will use to propose to my girlfriend.  Very helpful staff and very friendly.  They even rushed my order for the setting because I needed it early and didn't charge me extra.  Great place to buy stones or whole rings.<//Review>

<review>Highly recommend Jenny and her store! We were referred to Jenny by my brother and soon to be wife. Jenny had created a absolutely beautiful ring for my sister-in-law to be. So my husband decided to use Jenny to updated my wedding band for our Anniversary. What a beautiful surprise it was! I absolutely love my new ring. Jenny went over and above to create the perfect ring for me. She was very professional and went out of her way to make sure that my husband and myself left more than satisfied! We will definitely we using Jenny for all our jeweler needs from here on out! Thank you so much Jenny for going over and above for my husband and myself! I love my new ring!!< /review>< username>

Excellent service and care, Jen and her staff at Diamonds Forever made sure my engagement ring for my fiancee was perfect!

Everything about my experience here was exceptional, and I was helped all along the way during the process of having the custom ring made. Regular updates were provided, and the end result made for an absolutely perfect engagement.

All of her friends have been telling me how good of a job I did, and I owe it to Diamonds Forever!< /text>

Ended up wandering into Diamonds Forever months ago, because we wanted to see a particular gemstone in person, and they had them in stock. We were greeted by Jenny, who showed us the stones and was very patient and helpful while we tried dozens of rings to find what we liked best. When we were ready to buy, we came back here. Amy completed our appraisals and helped find us a better matching wedding band. We never felt uncomfortable during our experience, which was really important for us as part of the LGBT community. Overall, we had a great experience at Diamonds Forever, and we're really happy with our rings.<//review>

Yes, I found a beautiful engagement ring and wedding bands at fair prices. But what set this experience apart was the attitude of the owner and her staff. Unlike the other shops I visited there was no sales pitch and no pressure to make a purchase. The owner is a GIA graduate and it shows in her knowledge and passion. She patiently answered all my questions and gave me some great insight in how to make the proposal one that my wife would remember. I can not recommend Diamonds Forever highly enough.<//text>

Jenny and her team are amazing. She spent a lot of time with me. I was looking for a non-traditional engagement ring, and she knew exactly the style I was looking for and designed it beautifully! My fiance also got his ring there. She has a great selection!< /Review>

<review>Just picked up the perfect ring from Jenny earlier this week. Her and her team were fantastic to work with and really helped me out from start to finish (i.e. Learning about diamonds and ring shopping to finally making a purchase after shopping around). Super comfortable environment - I never felt like I was being sold, rather that I was being taught the different aspects that go into the value of a diamond with fair prices that I was able to negotiate down to fit my budget with what I wanted. I will go to Jenny with any and all of my jewelry needs from here on out! Highly highly recommend!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Great experience with this jewelry store, I had two rings designed by Jenny they are beautiful.  Great selection to detail.  Best place for engagement rings, she always works with you on your budget, try her best to get you the greatest stone 💎.    I recommend this store very highly, great costumer service.

<Review>I just want to thank you Jenny for being a life savor!!  When I googled this place the name intimidated me, little loan walking into the store with a bunch of shinning diamonds that look like they are from Rodeo Drive.  I am from Riverside county and needed a quick loan.  She came to my rescue.  She was friendly, felt like I knew her for years, and she was down to earth.  She did everything she could to help me and I came out as a very happy camper.  I will be back soon to see you and maybe buy a diamond or two :)</Review>< pictures>

Jenny and Ben are awesome. They totally helped me and my wife with a diamond engagement ring appraisal for our insurance policy. They cleaned the ring for free, gave us fast and friendly service, and will definitely get our business moving forward. Diamonds Forever is our new jeweler in San Diego!</Text>

I needed to get my gold chain soldered so I checked out this shop because it was near my place. The lady said it would cost $45 and would take a week to do the job. $45??? What a rip-off! A week??? Wow, I couldn't wait that long for a simple soldering so I had to go to another jewelry shop and I was only charged $5 for the repair and waited about 15 minutes. Never coming back here again!</text>

It was evident to me that your center stone had fall out. I am sorry if you thought I was implying you had tampered with the ring. It did not look this way.\n\nWhat I tried to express was though you had an old appraisal ( as many customers do) as an appraiser we have to do all of our same tests, measurements, grading and research in order to value your jewelry. In good conscience I can not just copy the last appraisers work and sign my name to it. For this reason our same rate of $95 applied.\n\nThere may be another jeweler that would be willing to do just that but we are not. Our entire staff is GIA trained and our appraiser is a NAJA member. This holds us to a higher standard of ethics and honesty.\n\nI wish you had mentioned you were military before we quoted you a price as we do offer special rates for those that serve and protect our country.\n\nAgain my sincere apologies.\n\nWarmly,\n\nJenny'}</response>

I would never go here again! I already was upset the diamond on my ring broke off and went there to get a insurance appraisal. The lady was completely rude and acted as if I stole my ring. I also took in the paper work I got from buying my ring. I am not a thief and was very upset they treated me and gave me rude faces like I was one.</Review>

Great bar!  If you're waiting for a table at Manuel's,  have a drink at the Mediterranean.< /Text>

Mediterranean is a pretty cool little bar in Aptos. A local spot for sure, but everyone there is very welcoming. They have pretty good prices for their drinks and are in the cool part of the neighborhood surrounded by a few other places. The Med is one of those places that you can spend all night in and lose track of time, and the bartenders are pretty amazing.<//review>

Drinking bar with pool table and jukebox. Mostly locals..."where everybody knows your name". Good place to relax on a rainy day. Seacliff Beach is within walking distance.< /Review>

<Text>The Med is a true dive bar; a great place to have a casual drink but don't expect much. The drinks are cheap and poured strong. There's a wildly varied crowd. Sometimes the crowd is a little too rough but I do think it's calmed down over the years. The crowd seems younger, lately but maybe it's just that I'm getting older. I gave it three stars because it's a dive but I do meet friends here for a drink, every time I'm in town and I would recommend you do the same!< /Text>< Rating>

This bar has changed ownership and may appear cleaner, but it's worse than before. Not a safe place for women to go alone for a drink or secure place for women to work. Not unless you don't mind a little sexual harassment to go with that pay check! It's best to just call it what it is, a DIVE BAR that's way over priced and filled with drama. Beware!< /review>

Well, the fancy picture that comes up for this bar is not accurate.  It's more of a dive bar with people smoking right outside the doors and a lot of F bombs being dropped.  Based on the picture that popped up in my Google search, I thought we'd be going to a fancy bar who specialize in making martinis. Once we walked in, we had a feeling that asking for a Vesber was out of the question, so we thought ordering a dirty martini would be simple enough. We paid 8 dollars each for our dirty martini that tasted like straight olive juice. The clientele are nice and lots of people were playing pool and having a great time. Mostly beer was ordered. So if you like playing pool and drinking beer, then this is your bar.
I personally do not like the misleading picture that pops up first when doing a search.</text>

<Text>I've been to this bar probably 20 times in the past three years to have a beer and shoot some stick since it is within walking distance of my home. Every time I go there there's drama of some kind. The pool table probably causes more trouble than it's worth since most of the altercations I've seen have been a direct result of it. There are ex cons pushing up on patrons there and I've seen people whacked out of their minds on drugs and displaying erratic behavior. Then you've got the degenerate drunks at the bar who slobber over everything in a dress. Look, I understand the allure of this place, the bartenders are pretty cool and the drinks are priced well and the pours are good. Heck, it's right down the street too! But what it comes down to is I just wouldn't feel comfortable taking my wife there for a beer and a game of pool because the clientele there is questionable at best.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I go to the Lawndale location I enjoy going there due to the. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. Hassle free payment setup. They’re very clean and organized also follow CDC guidelines.</text>

This review is for a Lawndale office. This time visiting the office was a different experience. The office did not have its usual cheerful, themed decor. I decided to look past that but then was helped by a young women who did not have answers to any of my questions, my guess is she was straight out of school. The male “doctor” I waited so long for to make sure my final retainer fit was incredibly rude. No hello or small talk from him.. just “do this” “now do that” no pls, thank you or goodbye from him. He also seemed annoyed to be helping me at all. Awful customer service. I no longer recommend this office.</Review>

Staff seems very confused about contracts and prices , when my previous insurance was billed supposedly the insurance rejected a charge but I was never notified yet recharged the amount that insurance was supposed to pay. Then I was being charged late fees since March of 2020 (covid impacted) which increased my cost for balance due . But was told system generated charges had I have figured this out other wise would I have been informed or would I be paying? I just want to pay off my 3 children's braces next week get them removed and finish with this place. I usually don't post comments like this but I'm just not happy at all.< /text>

<Text>We did not complete treatment and paid full upfront. They were supposed to reimburse us a portion so we could continue treatment elsewhere. I’ve reached out several times, the new orthodontist has reached out several times along with our insurance company with no luck in getting a response.

I am now going to have to take legal action against this company.< /Text>< resp>

The office is clean and updated, what I am highly upset about is the length of time waiting on appointments. I have been asking if I could please get my braces off before my birthday (Oct), they said they would. I will be ready to have them off next month, but appointment desk said they would send me a postcard to make an appointment January 2021. I feel like they are prioritizing the patients they are still collecting monthly fees on, and not the ones that are done with treatment. I am so done with this place and the way they run it. I can't wait to get these braces off and never have to set foot here again. I am never recommending this place to anyone.</Review>

I absolutely love this office & the staff! So attentive to your needs. As I myself grew up with fear and anxiety of dentist offices, Dr. Lili's office has changed my perspective. Till this day I am so glad I made the leap and decided to get braces, no regrets! Love how my smile is transforming!< /review>

Great experience at Dr. Lili's office, specially at this time that were experiencing COVID-19, they're very careful about the process. I feel so confident to bring my daughter to her braces appointment, her staff is very helpful, courteous and friendly. They're so nice. I truly recommend this orthodontic place.< /text>

<review>Really bad experience with all the process took for ever to remove my braces I can believe this people all the time fully booked up. Never had appointments closer, all the appointment the they offer you is 2 to 3 months after that’s crazy and they don’t care about their patients, so disappointed with this company I would totally not recommend it to anyone 😡< /review></record></dataset><record>

It’s a great place with good staff. They always try to make you feel at home. Sometimes it can be a little rough but overall they are awesome! They have great billing arrangements and they try to work with you on payments. Totally recommend this place for orthodontics. :)< /Review>

I still have a big over bite and sadly they are taking my braces off next week. At first my treatment was going great but as soon as  I pay them the whole amount 3,500 + they over charge me about $1,500 they stop caring of my treatment. I am very disappointed! There customers service is fine but I don't come here to get treated nice.</review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>This location is very clean and the staff is courteous and helpful. They have coffee/hot chocolate and cookies in the waiting room and a small playroom for toddlers. They work as best they can to offer reasonable rates. The parking is relatively small so arrive atleast 15-20 minutes before appointment time to be able to find parking. Front office employee, Diana, deserves recognition for her professionalism and courteous manner. She was able to coordinate my payment arrangement and was patient and informative throughout the process. Based on my experience today, I would recommend this location.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Excellent and fast service! If theres a problem with your braces you can make an appointment and have it fixed right away at no cost. Plenty of knowledgeable staff with their own areas makes waiting time less than 15 min. Would give it 5 stars but theres very limited parking. I usually park down the street.</Review>

Front desk ladies and the most of staffs are wonderful..but their on line payment system is so frustrating that i have to call them every month to credit back for the late payment fee which i have never paid late!!!
And even i paid one week ago but my payment wasnt updated..<//Text>

Wait time for appointments is usually 5 mins or less. Employees are nice and are able to answer any questions or concerns you have. The office is clean and there's complimentary coffee and cookies<//Text>

My son only had a little over bite and teeth that were too close together. We paid for him to get braces and they were doing pretty well in the begining. When the treatment was 1 year in, the dentist started to open his teeth (as in leaving gaps between his teeth). We went to another dentist to see if this was fine and he said it wasn't. They aren't suppose to do this. They are making the process much longer, only to make sure we pay. I believe this is not right.</Text>

The receptionist approach you in a unconcerned uncomforting and lack of customer service professionalism; to the point they even fail to service in the most simplest way. I ask kindly to turn the  tv for my kids the receptionist response was that (she will in a minute) and she never did, instead she got up pick up her keys and walk away.<//review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>The Huntington Park office is over booked with appointments in my opinion. I arrived early for my daughter's appointment because I was told over the phone the day before that it was okay to do and she would be fitted in the schedule. We waited about 1 hour. That's was my fault.

During this time I was witness to the horrible behavior of the people in the waiting room who are for the most part parents with small childen whom are left to run amok in the waiting area.

There are refreshments offered in the waiting room in the form of Starbuck's coffee from a machine, tea, water and cookies.

Unfortunately the people in the waiting room provide drinks to their small children and cookies who in turn drink and spill these all over the floor. No matter how many times the cookies get replaced they are gone within minutes of being laid out by the staff which invariably leaves a few wanting children who in turn start to cry loudly over the issue. The waiting room was filled with half empty cups of cofree and various drinks which their owners never bothered to place in the trash.

The staff is well trained and pleasant but are too busy with their work, often dealing with the rude parents and can hardly be expected by the management to also have to school adults on what is proper behavior for them or their children out in a public area.</Text><Time>1517968923159<//Time><user_id>108547725119463459787</user_id>< user_name>

<review>It was a great experience for me because as soon as I came in all the Girls greeted me as if they Knew me.
As when I check in in the front desk The receptionist Gladis  was really meticulous and  sweet, explained I only had to fill out one form and was trilled to hear that; since I know in most places you have to fill out a whole packet . When they passed me in to the back  to take some pictures The X-ray technician assistant was very detailed in what she was doing that made me feel completely comfortable. Shortly after when I was passed in the Examination room The Tx coordinator and The Dr,Tarim answered all my Questions (Great Deals) Supper excited to get started this month ; Fantastic and profetional staff from The girls in the front to back staff to the Drs (Great practice )am glad I found Dr,Lili’s practice in Huntington park :)< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2c946df61a655:0xdbfc27da60ab7b99<//gmapID></record>

They told me my 12 year old had a serious condition in her jaw, she needed corrective surgery, her jaw was in danger, her teeth were danger.blah blah blah. It was going to cost 2,500 or she was going to be in immense pain until she had said surgery. I did'nt have the money at that moment so i left, with them shaking thier heads. I moved out of the city, took her to a new dentist and guess what?! She has nothing!!! Nada..zero..zip....so BEWARE people!!!
Tengan cuidado de estas personas......me querian cobrar 2,500 por un tratamiento "urgente" a mi hija de 12 anos. Pero a llevarla a otro dentista resulta que no tenia nada de "urgencia" ...NADA...absolutamente nada. Tengan mucho mucho cuidado.</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>2</Rate><resp>None<//resp><Review>(Translated by Google) Well, in this clinic there are a lot of clients and I waited 15 minutes to go to La Niña but with El Niño if I waited like 40 minutes for La Niña to pass, I was still waiting for the child to come out the girls are attentive is the truth but about the slow appointments because if you make an appointment it is because they will attend to the children on time and one waits a lot ... hence all the girls inside and at the reception were very hardworking, all were in their own business and were very professional and friendly.

(Original)
Bueno en esta clínica hay mucho cliente y espere  15 minutos para pasar a La Niña pero con El Niño si espere como 40 minutos a que pasara salió La Niña y todavía me quedé esperando al niño que salieran las muchachas son atentas es la verdad pero sobre las citas lentos por que si uno hace una cita es por que en tiempo van atender a los niños y mucho espera uno... de ahí todas las muchachas de adentro y de la recepción muy trabajadoras todas estaban en lo suyo y muy profesionales y amables.</Review></record></dataset><record>
