I had a wonderful experience. Kevin does amazing pedicures. He is thorough, and leaves your feet smooth and beautiful!
This is the only thing that I do extra for myself, so to have a relaxing experience is very important to me. And knowing my hard earned money was well spent 🙏</text>

<Review>I called and got a same day appointment. They greeted me and I selected my colors. The space was clean safe, with two other customers receiving services within safe distance. Both the deluxe mani and pedi were excellent! Thorough, detailed. Really nice, pleasant service. I’ll definitely go back.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80ece177411bcf55:0x3afbb9bb2786fc9a<//Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate>< user_id>

<text>We are staying for our family vacation in Cayucos.  7 of us girls wanted to be pedicures while the guys golf. We picked the perfect nail salon. Top Nails in Morro Bay.  3 of the 7 were my grand daughters 8, 6 and 4. They had a great experience.  They entire staff made us feel welcome and went above and beyond.  We will come back here no questions.  Thank you for the best experience for my family.  5 star all the way.</text>< rating>

<review>WOW! One of the best pedicures! The nail technician (male) was very meticulous and cleaned up my nails, cuticles and calluses. I loved the way the paid attention to the callus removal in a very natural way. They even do the paraffin was as part of the service. Double massage, too. Once with a scrub and oil and one with warm lotion. Final event was a quick massage with a special oil at end. (So technically three massages.) My feet and legs feel so happy! Well worth it - price was beyond affordable ($31) so tip well :) If you're visiting this area, Top Nails is the place to go. Thank you Top Nails.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Deluxe pedicure $33 , WORTH IT. Staff is friendly, atmosphere is relaxing, & overall the best pedicure i’ve ever had. they take their time & it’s so relaxing in here. It cost more to get the French tip but that’s to be expected most places. I will definitely be coming back !< /review>

I think this place is much cheaper than many other places. And their services are really good. I didn't make an appointment but the lady took me right away. I had gel polish here. They did a good job on my nails and they lasted longer than I expected. Honestly, their staffs were great nail artist. Highly recommend for this place.</text>

I wouldn't go anywhere else since i knew this place. Everybody here is super nice and cute, they do take their time on customers. I got Deluxe Pedicure for $33 today and my technician did a fantastic job. My nails looked so fabulous. What a great price for such a high quality products and works they worked on me. Highly recommended!!!< /review>< Pics>

Actually love this nail salon with highly qualified and the staff is friendly.
I try almost the services at this nail salon and I see that all of them are great, and served by professional technicians and with the best products in the market.
My nails always become much more beautiful, polished and healthy aften coming here.
Come to try if you have chance.< /Text>

The absolute worst place I've gotten my nails done. Me and my friend went to get acrylic sets for prom it cost $45 each. The nails on my thumbs are not even kind of similar in size, one has bumps on the edge because he didn't smooth it out and every single one isn't straight. We were the only two in there for almost 2 and a half hours. Three women were sleeping in chairs behind us. Completely unprofessional and completely overpriced for the job.</text>

Pedicure was very rushed. Took about 25 min total, including soaking. didn't add anything to the water to soften your feet or bubble. They didn't do a good job on removing cuticles from nails, and the paint job was awful. Massage was pretty much non existent. Won't be going back unfortunately.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Just got a gel mani & pedi.  The experience could have been better.  The three techs were spread too thin.  All three worked on me at odd intervals.  It took an hour and 45 minutes before I left.  I had called several hours earlier for an appointment and arrived early.  My cuticles are not smooth,  they never massaged my hands, arms nor legs, as I saw them do with other clients. One of my nails is not covered smoothly.   It was the most expensive ever, costing $70 before tip.  I will not return.<//text>

I went their yesterday with a friend for pedicures. The guy who did mine was very aggressive and cut way to much skin off, my toes still hurt. Then to top it off when the owner finished with my friends pedi, she picked the tools she just used up, and moved onto her next client (acrylic manicure), no dipping them into a sterile solution or getting freshly sterilized tools. How many people had they used those tools on before cutting my toes?!?

First time here. Took my daughter to get her nails done for first time.. very friendly and nice. We did a walk in and the wait wasn't that bad. Place closed at 7pm but she still took customers in as long as they r willing to wait.<//review>

Really hoping I don't end up with some weird foot fungus. Apparently the gentleman who did my nails didn't like the shape of them so just randomly put gel where he got my nails should be. Looks horrible. We'll be going to have been redone somewhere else tomorrow</review>< pics>

<text>I came here because my nail place was booked, and I was very disappointed. This place is very dirty. The spa chairs are ripped, tub is dirty and they don’t use plastic covers for the foot tub. If you just go yourself and look around, you will see so many things wrong and dirty. I won’t be coming here again.</text><name>Mar Madrigal< /name><user_id>108410473356017929000<//user_id>< Pictures>

Came here because of reviews. The spa wasn't working and chairs did not have the message feature.
Oh well.. still gave it a try.  My pedicure experience was not the greatest. It was a very quick pedicure.. I feel like she just painted my nails. Won't be going back.<//Review>

So I went to this place because I checked the reviews. When I got there it was so weird, and it looked dirty to me, they didn't ask me anything basically ignored me. There was only one lady doing the work I left after 5 minutes. It may be cheap but I rather pay $40 for a safe, clean and professional work done.<//review>

(Translated by Google) It was a very rushed job, it did not last 5 minutes, it did not even reach to soak the nails, it is not fair and they have already done some times.

(Original)
Fue un trabajo muy apurado no duro ni 5 minutos, ni siquiera alcanzó a remojar las uñas , no ma justo y ya ban algunas veces.< /review>

've bought several parts from this place and have never had a problem if you are saved the receipt in the parts not good they will definitely try to compensate you however it is possible that you may have to pay a restocking fee but it's not that bad

Ok lets get one thing out of the way the people giving 1 to 2 star reviews think they deserve more. They think you should have to pay them for getting their car towed or you should give them money for bad customer service. I have seen multiple people working here who have passion and work day and night for this. They deal with you people who are so self centered you believe you deserve it all.< /Text>

<review>Customer Service is a strong point at this place.  I can't speak to anyone else's experience, but if you need to get back on the road, and they have the parts, I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Maybe the folks who reviewed earlier asked for something like an ashtray or a sun visor?  They won't look for some of the smaller stuff, but I go to Pick a part for that, anyway. Hopefully, I won't need them again anytime soon, but when I do, I won't hesitate to go back.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c34b9f688a9ca3:0xe09ed696427a9be7</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I called and made sure they had what I needed and was given a price. I wasn't able to get there for a week but when I did they had my part and the price was the same. Like any place that sells used car parts, the warranty is limited but if it's a good part the warranty doesn't need to last forever just long enough to get it installed and tested. The staff is as helpful and as respectful to you as you are to them. If you need a part for your car and used one will work, give these guys a call. You certainly could do business with a worse outfit but not many that are better than this place.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Admittedly we were skeptical about this business because we read such horrific reviews, which were highly critical of the staff's attitude and integrity. Also, because the company spoke negatively about Craigslist buyers (and WE were Craigslist buyers) in some of their responses to those bad reviews, it made us even more hesitant. On top of that, after we put a deposit on the parts we wanted, we read some reviews claiming there were no refunds on deposits, only store credit. Well, that was bad news for us, if true, because we live 133 miles from this business.  Not so convenient to redeem any store credit.

But, they said they had the parts we wanted, and because there were also enough good reviews from satisfied customers, we decided to drive over 260 miles round trip to Dan's. This is our experience: the staff, all of them, in the office and in the yard, were friendly, helpful and did not try to sell us anything we didn't want. So, basically, nothing like the nasty descriptions left by several disgruntled folks. Not saying some of those folks didn't have reason to gripe, but
it also sounds like many of them had unreasonable expectations.  For crying out loud, it's a auto dismantling business, they sell used parts, they can't guarantee the stuff like the local dealership. And they sure aren't charging like the dealership, either. Learn to read the signs and your paperwork and ask questions BEFORE you sign on the dotted line. If you want somebody to grin and play nice while you pay through the nose for the privilege of returning the wrong part you bought, then the used auto parts yard is not for you.  Head straight to your local auto parts retailer for some cheap imported knock off that won't fit, or cough up some hefty money for a brand new OEM part, then either way, cough up some more money to have it installed. But, don't blame Dan's, the terms and the risk liability information was available before the purchase.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1543279565693, 'text': 'Thank you!'}<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Honestly I've never been here. Went in for a door handle. Turned put they didn't have it but I gave the wrong engine size so it was my fault. Than I ask the guys about an issue with my transmission and they give me a good deal. I went back to drop off my car for the install and one of the guys actually helped me check my car to make sure it was the transmission that was bad on my camry. I must say for my 1st experience the guys were pretty helpful and even directed me to go next door to help me find the door handle that I did need.<//review>< pics>

Yep i REALLY wish i had read the reviews before purchasing my motor. They lied about pricing and sold the wrong parts and the young Asian Kevin said he didnt care. They were a junk yard and i couldnt do anything about it. So i guess thats why the cash offer seemed so good.  Dont ever buy anything from them it seems as though they have good prices when you shop around but they are just crooks and they will find a way to screw you. I confronted the owner Dan about the situation but he didnt seem to care about honoring his sons prices or word... This is the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a business..< /Review>

The individual i talked to was very un-professional and rude. I asked about a specific engine and the individual acted like he didnt care and repeated himself numerous times saying it was sold after i had only said one sentence to him and then i asked about a different engine and the individual again started repeating over and over that it was sold. Very unsatisfied with the lack of professionalism and the rudeness. I will never do business with them and i will make sure all my associates never do business with them either.< /text>

The day was a bright sunny day, and we allowed the customer to check out the merchandise. We didn't hide anything. After 2 weeks he brings it back and says the body shop can't fix it. We instead try to help out the customer and give him store credit. As a store, we are not entitled to give a credit, but did it to help him out. Instead, we are called crooks and dishonest. The signs in the office and the invoice state all that and you agreed upon it. You even acknowledged it and thanked us when you first bought it. Hope you learn your lesson. Check your body parts.

I called over the phone about a gas tank for my truck . Young asian guy said he mostlikely had it there or he would order. When I showed up he lied about having any there at all and said he would have to order it . Then he wanted a $100 dollar deposit and I asked if it wasnt the right one if he would return my money, he said no. His attitude and service was really bad, I will never go there again.</Text>

(Translated by Google) They don't deserve any stars. They are liars. They have no word and do not respect deals. They told me a price for an engine and I agreed and when I called them again they told me that they couldn't sell it to me at that price, that it would be more expensive. Don't buy anything from those people who have no word.

No se merecen ninguna estrella. Son unos mentirosos. No tienen palabra y no respetan los tratos. Me dijeron un precio de un motor y yo estuve de acuerdo y cuando les volvi a llamar me dijeron que no me lo podian vender a ese precio, que iba a ser mas caro.

I drive an hour to use SM Motors. Yes, their mechanics are good and consistent. What separates them from other places is their customer service. Ray, is very good about picking up the phone and keeping you posted. I appreciate that more than anything else.  This is why I drive an hour past other shops who do similar work. Thank you SM Motors, but especially Ray.< /review>

<Text>I went to Santa Monica motors to get a smog check. The guys were so nice and were able to do the service immediately. The smog check took less than 15 minutes and as I was checking out and dreading my trip to the dmv, they offered to renew my vehicle registration right there on the spot. This was a dream come true! I can’t recommend Santa Monica motors enough. They are true professionals and truly kind people.</Text>< Date>

It was my first time here for a smog check. They were really friendly. I was 15 mins early for my appt but they were able to check me in early. I chose to wait in their office since it was really windy. Otherwise I would have gone to the farmer's market on the corner of Pico and Cloverfield. Smog check took about 15 mins. I was in and out. Very happy with their service and will definitely go back.<//Text>

<Review>Took my car into my dealership to get routine service and a smog check.  Unfortunately,  my registration stated that I had to have a smog check at a "STAR" station.  I am so glad that I happened upon Santa Monica Motors.  I called Bob and explained my urgent situation and he was wonderful.  He told me to drive over and he would take care of me.  Their waiting room is clean and comfortable.  You can make your own cup of coffee while listening to Bossa Nova gently playing the background.  Bob took care of everything at half the price the dealership would charge. I'm a customer for life!</Review>< Rating>

Very quick. Took less than 20 mins. No issues. I'd make sure your check engine light is not on. I'm pretty sure that's an automatic failure at any smog check.<//Review>

Best service I have ever had. I needed my fluids checked and they kindly did it FOR FREE without an appointment even though they were busy. I have gotten smog checks here that were quick, painless and cost efficient. I would recommend Santa Monica Motors to anyone. You won't find a better group of mechanics in LA.<//Text>

<Text>Without going into a lot boring details, it took years before finding the perfect place for my car that had developed a significant chronic issue.    Seriously, I would Google, ask friends, etc., and each time was such a disappointment.  But these guys correctly diagnosed the problem, made the repair, we talked briefly about the next service, and I was done.  My car runs beautifully and I no longer worry about being stranded someplace because a mechanic either didn't care or know what they were doing.  They are considerate, knowledgeable and I believe very honest.

The irony is that I've taken my car there over 6 years for smog checks - had no idea that a full-service mechanic was there too.  So happy they remodeled and TAH DAH!  Don't hesitate if you're looking - I believe you will be very pleased.< /Text>< Pics>

I totally recommend this location!  Bob (at the desk) and the gentleman who did the smog check were professional, fast and incredibly nice. The whole procedure took 10 minutes and then they sent the results to the DMV so I could renew my registration online.  Excellent service.</review>

Great price for Santa Monica ($70 for smog check). Nice lil office with free coffee, TV and magazines. Took literally 15 minutes, very fast. 10/10 would go again.< /Review>

Wow. Never had such an easy and pleasant time getting a smog test before. Lol. That's ridiculous to even say. So quick, its unreal. Also, the guys came out of the garage to greet me the moment I got out of my car. They were so pleasant and so helpful and so kind, I have to be honest, i was very shocked and taken aback. Just not the quality of service you expect from a shop. I wouldn't go anywhere else now. Found this place from Yelp and went because of all their good reviews and high rating. Now I see why!< /Text>

Confusing layout
Fast and accurate service
Good pricing was able to handle ugly Land Rover for inspection
Staff was accommodating and not too intimidating
Waiting room was cozy and clean
For an auto repair facility I would describe this as clean and inviting
When will California ever Stop Smog inspections.<//text>

Came off a 3.5 hour session at the DMV getting my registration renewed and turns out I needed to get a SMOG done first. The DMV recommended this place as it was very close by. I was literally in and out before I could finish my complementary coffee. The gentleman at the front desk was extremely helpful and let me know that I could avoid going back to the DMV by taking my renewal paperwork straight to AAA where I am a member. Really top notch service, keep it up!< /Text>

I went here because it's close to my work. There was no wait (around 12pm on a Wednesday).

There's a waiting room with a water machine and some individual chairs.

The service went faster than I expected although I may have lost track of time while reading a book.

When I went to drive, some lights on my dashboard were on. The technician explained to me why and I went on with my day.

I would give a higher score but I think the premium location rent prevents this place from charging less than $55 (after coupon) for a smog check. At least they're (Bob Rich) was really friendly< /review>

This place is absolutely awesome. Went on my lunch break to get a smog check. No line and the test was over in 10 minutes. I was also able to get my car registration done too - they even had the tags on site. It's seriously a mini-DMV with WAAAAY less hassle. So happy with the service and would recommend this place to anyone.<//Text>

No one likes to go for a smog check, but there's no getting away from it.  The service here was quick and efficient and the staff was courteous and friendly.  I'll be back when I have to have my next smog check.</Text>

Been seeing this place for a while now since coming back from college in March. Finally had some delivered. I got "The Jazz," red velvet cake, mint chip ice cream, and chocolate sauce (if you're judging me, don't). Aside from the rich ice cream, the cake really sold me w/ perfect texture and consistency. Jamz is definitely doing something here, happy to call it a local joint.< /text>

My wife and I visited Jamz Creamery today after church and very much enjoyed it. We were greeted with a warm smile and hello from Jay, the owner. He was very personable. I had The Jazz with half red velvet and half chocolate cake, with butter pecan ice cream topped with caramel drizzle. SO GOOD! My wife has a scoop of vanilla ice cream atop an oatmeal raisin cookie. Though the cookie was a bit crunchy, she still gave the indulgence a thumbs up. Jamz is nestled on Manchester in the heart of Inglewood. The interior is clean and nicely decorated. It was our first time, but we will definitely be returning in the future!< /text>

Great service and ice cream. We ordered two the jazz to go, one yellow cake with black walnut and red velvet cake with rock road which contains nuts and marshmallows. The cakes were moist and thick, and you can choose a drizzle to be on top of the cake too. We liked our order, the only thing that's not so perfect was the rock road ice cream was too melted.<//text>

You can find delicious ice cream in many different places, which this place definitely has, but the friendliness and and welcoming feeling is what makes or breaks a place. Great family owned, welcoming, fun environment!< /text>

I stopped by today because I read that they had black walnut ice cream which is old school. So when I got back home I had planned to eat just half of it and then save the rest for later. Well that was what I had planned. I started eating it and ended up eating the whole pint. That was the best black walnut I have ever had and I truly mean that!!</text>

My kids and I started coming to Jamz as a reward for their good grades/behavior and I'm so glad we did. It's like getting a double-scoop of confidence and assurance.

The owner and his sister always ask my kids about the outcomes of their games/projects/exams...they don't forget! Because they go the extra mile to connect with their community, Jamz has become part of our village. My kids (and I) love this place! The ice cream options are endless, and the customer services is exceptional!< /Text>

<review>The service was amazing and the ice cream even better! I am extremely specific about how I like my banana milkshakes prepared and the gentleman was more than willing to tend to my specificities, and it was PERFECT! As annoying as I am sure I was, his attitude remained positive and pleasant, making my experience so much better. Thank you for the best banana milkshake ever! I will be sure to visit before heading back to Maryland (where I am certain I cannot receive there)!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1533841931861, 'text': 'thanks so much'}< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>EXCELLENT ICE CREAM.
I HAD THE BUTTER PECAN.

GOOD LOCATION.
EASY TO FIND.
HELPFUL; COLORFUL BANNER OUTSIDE.

GREAT PRICING.
* Maybe increase the price a little bit.
(Did I just type that ?)

I HOPE TO SEE THIS BRAND "JAMZ CREAMERY" IN STORES & SUPERMARKETS. Hmmmm.< /review>< pictures>

A little local ice-cream shop that is very cute and clean inside. I have to say that the quality of the ice cream is great, but the cakes know the other hand didn't meet my expectations. They were pricey and nothing seemed to be special to me. But everything else seemed great.<//Text>

The owner is awesome! The ice cream is awesome!
Whenever I come to Inglewood Jamz creamery is the first place I go.  The ice cream is refreshing and he has a home made cake specialy that is sandwiched in with ice cream and your favorite topping.  There is strawberry, lemon, caramel, chocolate! You name it.  It is so amazing!  You have to bring your kids because there is a really cute stand created just for them to perch on so they are able to see the different flavors and tell the owner what they want to order. Really cute. If you have not been here then you are missing out!<//review>

It was so delicious mine didn't make it out of the store. I also got some cookies for later that were melty in your mouthy. Customer service is nothing short of amazing and someone's soul was put into that cake. Anyway enough rambling I shall return.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Ice cream seller in a shopping area, nice concept and the ice creams are very good, there are enough choices to have fun, I liked it.

< Review>
Worse experience! Bulling is typical at this school, most times administration ignores it and have a poor way to handle it. Drinking and the use of drugs is a common activity among students.< /Review>

This place is a life saver! After going to The used Tire King and being turned away these guys were OPEN and Welcoming. Very helpful over the phone and in person. I do not live in Fontana or neighboring cities but my family does and I have recommended Willy's Tires to all of them! Great used tires for a great price very nice men working they speak Spanish also. They take cash and card. I will support this family owned business by continuing to purchase at Willy's Tires, thank you.</Text>

Today, my tire was severely punctured on the 15 Freeway, and thank God it happened near Willy’s Tires. They never disappoint! I made it in time just before they closed, and they very quickly took care of it. Owner also charged my dying phone while I waited, and we had a good conversation—truly, a great man and top notch service. Thank you!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I had a flat tire with my rental car while I was visiting socal. Went to Willy’s after seeing the great reviews. They treated me great, showed me how big the hole in the tire was and sold me a good used tire for a very fair price and had me back in the road in no time. Very impressed with their service and work ethic< /review>< Name>

<review>I ordered on the app twice & my order was not correct for my sandwich’s both times. It clearly says on top of the recite I asked for extra lettuce & a little bit more of oil & vinegar. I called about my order the second time which was today & the lady said they would make another sandwich & how sorry they were. I am on complete bed bed rest due to my pregnancy & I open the sandwich & it’s not even the correct sandwich I ordered in the beginning. I had to pick out the wax peppers because I cannot eat any hot foods or whatever hot due to having ulcerative colitis. They made me an all white sandwich when I ordered wheat, didn’t put extra lettuce, cheese was put when I didn’t order cheese at all, none of what I ordered in my sandwich was correct, & whoever made the sandwich put so much mayo. It was sloppy. Thanks KingsBurg! I have to avoid the Selma location because they’re just as stingy with the lettuce. I will be ordering again from here & my husband will be there to watch our order be made correctly with the extra lettuce I asked for. It’s not hard to put extra toppings when the customer pays for what they want.

UPDATE April 12, 2021

I was unable to respond to the owner, I also called to ask to speak to the manager & gave my name along with my call back number. It’s been a week now & I have not received a call back from the manager. Yes, I know what I ordered but if you look correctly on “special instructions” part & it’s listed on top of the recite (which I don’t have anymore nor did I take a picture of it), it clearly states Please extra lettuce on the BMT with cucumbers & no pepperoni & a little more vinegar & oil. The second BMT does not have cucumbers & it also says “less lettuce.” If I wasn’t on bed rest I’d go watch my sandwich be made so I could have my little bit of extra lettuce & the wheat bread not the white. Thank you for the response, I hope next time my order will be made correct & not so sloppy.</review>< Resp>

Everytime this place gets our order wrong. This time the owner was rude
when I called and asked for my money back. I ordered 2 spicey italians with provolone and bacon. We got 2 bacon sandwiches with hardly anything on them. So over places who can't get a simple order right and then act like it's your fault when they screw up. I guess that's rather lose customers by arguing than say oh we are sorry.<//review>

< Review>
It was nice although it looked like one young lady was doing 90% of the work while we were there...she made a salad and two foot longs in our(my family)order and what I presume was either her manager or the new owner walked around and looking for something to do other than eye contact with the customers....the food was delicious and the service of of the young lady that served us was friendly and polite...< /Review>

Cannot help but notice that the Indian employees know nothing about customer service. They are extremely lazy when it comes to taking customers for some odd reason and I say this because every time I've came in, it has been the same exact girl every time taking my order plus another 10 people in line while she's all alone and while this is happening, there are 2-3 Indian employees in the lobby either sitting around complaining about how tired they are, or mopping while there is a line out the door. (Please use your common sense) the floor is going to get worse when it's wet and the lobby is full of customers. It's sad to see the same poor girl all alone taking orders with no help. Great sandwiches though (worth the 25 min wait)<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Off the wall Decent Bar and Grill type Restaurant place with Some American / Mexican The food was good. The atmosphere was kinda like a old style rustic diner with a cute fireplace. The price was a bit expensive but maybe average for Napa. A must try if your looking for a cute bar and Gill place  and your in the area or you like to kill some time when in a high traffic.< /Review>

<Review>Norm has the restaurant business down. The Red Hen is a Napa institution that has been here forever. Good service,  good food, good surroundings. Especially if you're 20-something and you like noise and partying out on the deck!

The old location with the old chefs are missed.  The location it is now is closer to town which now has lost its out of the way atmosphere.  Too close to the highway.. Food doesnt taste as it used to.. Even so I come here for sentimental reasons.  The prices are good.  The customer service hit or miss..< /Review>

If you like Mexican food....don't eat here. Bland salsa, unseasoned fajitas, poor frozen margaritas, chips like out of a bag, even the jalapenos had no flavor. I've eaten better at Taco Bell and it cost a lot less.< /Text>

<user_name>Nichole Lynch< /user_name><time>1509586960184<//time><text>The reason they are even getting 2 stars and not less is because of the manager and the taste of the food. We made reservations for a party of 7 we got sat as soon as we got there. We ordered our food I got mine about 20mins before anyone else got theirs and then when everyone else did get their food no one else's was what they ordered. When the manager came over and retook the order they got everyone's food right except for one. They fixed the second mess up quickly.  We were there over 2 hours. Because they messed up so bad the manager ended up taking care of the bill except our drinks and that is why they are getting the 2 stars. The sad thing about how bad the service was the food was good. I will probably give another try because the food was good, hopefully the service will be better.<//text><GmapID>0x808500cd5e226027:0x552e84de958522ea<//GmapID><Rating>2< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Typical mexican theme cuisine, great margaritas and food was what you would expect from a tiny place on the side of the highway. Server Barbara was nice and quick! If you are looking for affordable food before heading to wineries up in Napa i'd recommend for an easy, no nonsense meal< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Quite possibly the worst Mexican I've had in 5 years. Yes Taco bell is a lot better. The chicken had zero flavor, the shrimp is freezer burned, mole was literally watered down, and how does a Mexican restaurant get beans wrong?

I don't think the chefs know what a little salt is either. Literally nothing was seasoned.

If you're desperate pickup something at a gas station.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808500cd5e226027:0x552e84de958522ea< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Had 3 rims that were scuffed up pretty good. I cannot tell which ones are repaired versus the one that isn’t. Price is reasonable and the work was done quickly.< /text>

<Text>A true master - Brian can make wheels look like new! Having a good “wheel scrape” guy is kind of like having a good heart surgeon, or a good divorce lawyer - you HOPE you’ll never need one, but if you do, you want the best. Brian is the best. I’ve had to use him multiple times (unfortunately for me, I scrape my wheels too often) - he works fast, comes right to your house, he’s friendly and professional, and he provides great value for his services. He’s an artist - his work is splendid.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1623992350065, 'text': "Wow Mike. Thank you for the kind words!

<review>I curbed one of my BMW M2's wheels pretty bad. Had a few other rashes from driving in Italy and Germany. Saw The Wheel Guys on Google and Yelp and decided to give them a go for repair. I was a little skeptical at the job they could do at first (M2 rims have particular colors and material) but, when Brian finished, I couldn't even tell where the damage occurred.

I can wholly recommend The Wheel Guys. Very professional, great prices, on time, and they guarantee their work. Even if you have a more expensive wheel, I wouldn't hesitate to give them a call.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWw6k9a_affcebBXii7p_nKcQcDBe7JpGgMaMw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU-323B24Deti1rGLP31RUO_70DSUPQ0TY39gv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>{'time': 1612985379652, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words John!

Excellent service. I have rare Tesla Zero-G wheels that I love and shortly after I got them I rashed themb on the passenger side. Then last week my daughter rashed the driver side. Enough was enough. I called the wheel guys and they were quick to respond, have a fair estimate and scheduled an appointment. The onsite cost was a bit much, so I decided to go to their home shop. They were great as I didn't have my card key and worked with me remotely to open and move the car as I waited at a Starbucks a block away. They were done super fast and they look great! Highly appreciative. I hope I don't need them again, but if I do, I will be back.< /text>

Had curb rashes on two of the wheels and Brian did an awesome job with making them look like new. He responded to my request in a timely manner and communicated well. He finished the work in 20 minutes. His prices were most reasonable compared to some other inquiries I made. I would highly recommend Brian for any wheel work.<//review>< pics>

It was great and seamless experience, wheels are transformed into completely new rims. There were too many scratches and I was worried if it would take lot of money and time to fix it. The person came on time and 3 wheels were done within 2 hours, best part was the service is done at your location, you don’t have to drive to body shop or leave your car there.< /Review>

<text>Brian, The Wheel Guy, is fabulous! I had pretty significant road rash on all four wheels on my Tesla Model 3. Amazingly in less than one hour, Brian had all four wheels looking like new again (and at a fair price). Note that if your bring your car to his home shop in Morgan Hill, you’ll save the travel charge. I highly recommend Brian and will be bringing my other car to him next week.

<review>Brian did an amazing job & I highly recommend “The Wheel Guys”. He saved my rims and they actually look brand new. All 4 rims were badly scratched to the point where It looked hopeless. Found “The Wheel Guys” on YELP and after reading the reviews and seeing the pics of Brian’s work, I had no reason to look elsewhere and glad I didn’t. Brian quoted a very reasonable price, he’s honest, friendly, provides excellent service and most importantly he does amazing work and takes pride in his work. And it shows.

Brian  responded very promptly to my request for a quote and was able to carry out the repair on my wheel within a couple of days.  He was very thorough in explaining how the wheel would look after.  I was very pleased with the work carried out by Brian and  although I hope to never have to use his services again, I definitely will use him again if the need arises.  I highly recommend him to anyone needing this type of repair.</Review><Time>1580158629794</Time>< resp>

I contacted The Wheel Guys to help with curb rash on my GTI. On the day of the appointment, Brian showed up on time and within one hour my wheels were factory new. In addition, Brian answered all my questions and provided life warranty for the wheels. The whole process was smooth and fast to repair the four wheels. Highly recommended quality business.</Text>

I had some curb damage on my two passenger side wheels that I was looking to get fixed for some time and did some research on Yelp and other sites and found the The Wheel Guys.  I emailed Brian some pictures of the damage and he gave me a quote very fast for the repairs.

He was just a few miles from me so I was able to bring my car over to his place and he repaired both wheels in 25 minutes.  Wow! and the difference between the before and after was excellent.  Unless you're right up against the wheel and looking specifically for the repair, you'll never see it.

Brian was a great guy.  Very friendly and very knowledgeable about wheel repair and had me back on the road fast.  Excellent service and great pricing.  I'd highly recommend giving him a call if you're looking to get rid of curb damage on your wheels.

Have a look at my two wheels that needed repairing and you'll see the before and after differences.  The front wheel had the deep scratch that I thought would need some filler, but it was repaired by sanding the scuff and scrapes out.

Thanks a lot Brian!<//Text>

This is the second time I have used Brian to repair grazed wheels. Both times he was responsive, clear about what could be done, and he kept me up to date with when he would arrive. The quality is superb, the first time was a silver alloy, this time was the matt black tesla wheel. Both were flawless. And Brian is a nice guy in to the bargain! Would highly recommend.< /text>

I reached out to Brian, the owner, online on Sunday about fixing two minor curb rashes on my car. He got back to me first thing Monday morning, and we scheduled a time on Tuesday morning for him to drive to my office to fix up the curb rashes. Brian was very courteous, respectful, and did an excellent job fixing up my wheels making them look brand new again. Will definitely use him again!<//Review>

Perfect wheel repair of my road rashed rims. Took my Evo X and Mercedes E class to Brian's garage shop, you'll save a little money driving there and if you like to drive like I do, Morgan Hill is a nice drive... from the Valley without traffic of course. He also does a mobile service and will come out to your place for a little more.

My EVO's 4 wheels took an hour and 15 minutes. My Mercedes ( little less rashed) 45 minutes and a repeat 2 wheels which I ended up scraping again :(

It took 20 minutes!! so as you can see Brian is very quick and with a perfect end product.  I went over to the Starbucks across the street to hang out while the repair was being done  Might want to bring your laptop while you are waiting. Like I said the repair was super quick, presto fixed. Brian did not have the exact "Chameleon" Paint for the repair, but suggested a unique metallic blue color... Wow turned out to accent the wheels and make them unique.. i.e. better than before! Got great compliments on them.

This is the only place in the area to get a quality and quick repair on your rims.  Brian said he has repaired more than 30,000 rims and that is all he does. He is a master craftsman in my opinion. See a sample of the repair pics before and after below.

Now if I can just watch those curbs!</Text>

I took my wife’s car here after I curbed it pretty hard. The car has black wheels so I was skeptical as to how much could be done. I was surprised at how great it looked and how fast he was done, and most importantly when I asked my wife to point out the repair she couldn’t find it.< /Review>

<Review>Highly recommend Brian from “The Wheel Guys”. Have gone to Brian on 2 separate occasions to fix the rim rash on my Tesla after curbing my wheels. Brian is very responsive and does flawless work where I can’t even tell where the rim rash originally was to begin with. I hope to never curb my wheels again, but I know I have a trusted person in Brian to take care of my wheels if the need arises.< /Review>< response>

Just an all around excellent experience. Brian is a great guy, his work impeccable. I was dreading replacing a couple wheels on my 2012 328i BMW. I had no previous experience with a wheel polishing professional but I thought I would take a chance. Brian showed up a little early for the appointment (unheard of in Santa Cruz!) and did his magic. I am very pleased with the outcome and have already recommended The Wheel Guys to a couple of friends. Could not have been a easier, well priced, excellent quality automotive service experience.<//text>

I had a curb rash on my aftermarket wheel. It was very easy and quick to make an appointment without wait time. He finished  my wheel in about 15-20 mins. I was amazed of the finish work and warranty included with the price he charges. I highly recommended to get your wheels fix from him. I’ll come back if i curb my wheel again.< /text>

<text>Brian was quick to respond and answered all my questions with the utmost respect. Most of the other wheel repair places I reached out to made me feel like the questions I asked were silly and that I don't know what I'm talking about. I asked him to do one wheel as it was my only concern, but given the convenience of his presence, I had him do all my curbed wheels. They all turned out wonderfully and my instant reaction was that he was a magician. Brian is a standup act and was nothing, but respectful and courteous of my time and vehicles. If you want the job done right and a hard working guy who does a quick turnaround at your convenience, then Brian is the man. God bless.<//text>< UserId.>

I pulled out of a parking space moments later and ruined my Varis CF underboards while damaging one of my wheels (rear driver’s side).

The wheels are a set of Rays Gram Lights 57DR in semi-gloss black, not the cheaper sets or reps you buy at a shoddy wheel shop. Nonetheless, I was determined to get the wheel fixed.

Upon researching other shops on Yelp, I found this business to be more reputable, plus some of the people I know in the car community have gotten their wheels fixed by The Wheel Guys.

Brian was fast and responsive, genuine and honest. He fit me in his schedule the next day and repaired my wheels, I kid you not, in 15 minutes or less. That’s what you call efficiency. My wheels looked as if nothing ever happened.

I’d definitely come back again if I had anymore work to do. He also has a warranty on the paint, should it ever come off for whatever reason. Thanks again!< /Text>< rating>

He gave me details on his process and was confident on repairing the wheel on my vehicle. He has over 13 years of experience, so he knew what he was doing. We took the vehicle to his work place, and literally only took him less than 15 min to repair our curb rashed wheel. When I reviewed the work he had done, I was pretty amazed. It basically looked brand knew again. The paint was well matched considering it was a non standard grey. I would definitely have Brian work on any future wheel repairs and refer him as well.

<review>Brian does amazing work. I brought my 2019 Audi RS3 here after an (embarrassing) incident that left nearly 1/4 of my rim with curb rash. He was very responsive and transparent in the options I had to repair the rim. I chose to drive to his location. He met me outside and explained how the repair would happen, and had a nice area for me to wait and watch TV. In literally 20 mins (as he said), my rim was near perfect again. Even I had a hard time knowing that a repair had been done and I knew exactly where to look! I highly recommend Brian for any/all wheel repairs. He’s a true professional and does quality work. I’ll definitely be returning if (god forbid) I have any future curb rash issues.< /review>< pictures>

The quality of the work here is always top notch and what makes it even better is that he always offers his expertise at a very reasonable and fair price. This is what sets his business on a higher level than all the other places to choose from. I’ve brought in my 2015 Toyota Prius twice for repair and have been throughly satisfied with the result both times. Brian’s quality of work consistently performs at the level of a high-end auto body shop’s standard and he’s always very respectful by honoring the estimate given and making sure he does the best job he possibly can during the time he has. Definitely check this place out, you won’t regret it!<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I have used Brian twice now. About a year ago, a few weeks after accepting delivery of my Model 3, I scraped the right front and back wheels badly. He came to my work in Menlo Park and took care of it while I worked. Today, I used him again to repair the same wheels (with much less damage) at his home shop. He is so friendly and quick. I needed to wait about 30 minutes after he was done for the work to dry before heading out on the freeway. I plan to use him should I scrape my wheels again!< /Review>

< Review>
While visiting my son in San Jose, I curbed his shiny new WRX STi giving the wheel about a 6" rash and he was sooooo not happy with me. I found Brian, got a quote within 2 minutes and had the curb rash fixed the next day. The results were phenomenal - I could not tell I had ever destroyed the wheel. Totally saved my trip. Probably saved my relationship with my son, too. x)<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I brought to Brian my 2008 Infiniti G37 Coupe with super low miles that I just bought a week ago, but it had some bad curb rash from the previous one owner on the OEM 19” Wheels that stick out a bit much from the tires.  Being a teacher and on a budget and after getting quotes from others who were almost double of what Brian was charging and needed an actual live look see instead of the pictures sent over of the curb rash, I got a great deal from Brian at about half the price of what others were charging for all 4 wheels.  Brian Of The Wheel Guys basically reshaped  the wheels and then primed, painted, and clear coated the wheels. It's all by hand. He took about an hour. Otherwise, other places would’ve put on a lathe and then grinding off material with CNC machine would’ve changed the geometry of the wheel making it look bad along with putting on Bondo that will chip away after about 6 months.....Brian’s work looks very good compared to the eye sore of curb rash I had before.  Plus his paint work has a lifetime warranty so if there needs to be touch up a few years later from fading, then he’ll be glad to fix that.  Bringing my car to his townhouse garage work shop got me a discount versus having his mobile service come out to me to note. I recommend Brian to repair your wheels most definitely.<//review>< Pics>

Just took my 2015 mustang eco boost to The Wheel Guys. I will add pics to my review shortly. My car is white with high gloss black top rims. All 4 wheels needed some repair. Straight up Brian the business owner and technician is exceptional. He runs a mobile service but if you are in Morgan Hill he will let you come to his home and he can repair your vehicle right from his garage. He has a lounge set up there and he works extremely fast. The rims turned out flawless after he was done. Lastly. I want to say that his price point is 40 % less expensive than another provider that comes very highly yelp recommended in san jose and needs an entire day to do a 4 tire job. I will be taking my Honda Civic Hatchback Turbo to Brian this month. Totally worth it.< /text>

<Text>Great stores. Be careful about locking up. Our van handles were sticky when we got back like someone had tried to break in. We were only gone for dinner and shopping about 1-2 hours between 6:30 and 8:30 pm. They tried every door.<//Text><time>1623619123014<//time>< UserId.>

I went to Trader Joe's because it is my favorite store in this Square but I also looked around since it has been a while I've been there. The movie theater is open as is Z Pizza downstairs also. It wasn't too crowded when I went but by the time I left the parking lot was filling up</Text>

I love that there are so many stores and restaurants in the plaza but hate the actual parking lot. It's a pain to navigate through and doesn't make it very easy for the high volume of drivers. I have no problem with any store itself, just the physical design of the place.< /text>

Yummy lunch at Urban Plates
Try the banana cream pie!
Cost Plus had plenty of Halloween fun stuff and great kitchen items.
Plenty of parking for now. Not sure how it will be once trolley goes in.
But then there's plenty underground that everyone forgets.
Check it out.</Review>

<Review>They have a wide variety of clothing and shoes for both men and women, the staff is always kind and the store is always clean and organized lines do get long but the staff move quickly to get people out of there as fast as possible the wait time is between 10 to 15 minutes when they are busy this Marshals is by far the best one and I've been to about 6 other ones in San Diego.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc06cd777ae9d9:0xf51bb043d7c50d3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Parking is harder while they build the parking garage, but I love to park underneath the shopping center. It's perfect so your car stays cool.< /review>

Busy area with lots to do and eat. Parking can sometimes be a pain but there is disability parking everywhere and since I'm disabled that really helps. Most businesses are very friendly and helpful.</text>

Really an amazing point. There are restaurants, grocery stores, a Starbucks, best buy, pier one, interesting food choices just across the road, Bank of America too. Parking can be an issue sometimes, but the further away you are, the higher your chances are.

On my last visit i parked next to a vehicle and didn't think anything of it. Ran into Ralph's for a quick purchase. When I got back to my car there was a citation from the parking security that I was taking up too much space. I was the only car in that row by then and I was parked right on the white line. I drive a vw bug. I think it was overkill on securities part.  I usually shop there a couple of times a week, but I have started to shop elsewhere.</Review>

The parking lot in this shopping center is the worst. The spaces are so small and the lanes are too narrow. I wouldn't go back simply because it sucks to park here.<//Review>

There are 2 major issues.  Design and drivers.

The way the parking lot is designed, the curves and the one way lines, creates a lot of confusion.  I can't tell what way a driver intends to go, because of the curves.  Little jams block up huge sections easily.

Drivers can't drive in La Jolla. I live in La Jolla, I'm used to it.  But a lot of drivers don't understand right of way or how to let a pedestrian pass. That is, if a person is already walking..... do not try to overtake them.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I like it. There are restaurants, grocery stores, a Starbucks, best buy, the AMC, pier one, interesting food choices just across the road, bank of America too. Parking can be an issue sometimes, but the further away you are, the higher your chances are :)</review>< pictures>

It's a good place to shop or have breakfast... the only problem is that few shops and restaurants are hidden behind and it sometimes takes a long time to find out if u are at the same location. A small map or info on them would be great if there was a map in the mall.</review>

Trader Joe's, a beautiful remodeled Ralph's, Best Buy, etc. The only thing that isn't there is a big drugstore. I live nearby and I'm there at least two times a week.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I like this mall. You can pretty much park in one spot, and shop all day because of the location.  Dsw, world market, Marshalls, Ralph's, and Ulta on one side of the street, and then a slew of other stores including Whole Foods and Nordstrom Rack.  Parking is scarier on that side closer to Whole Foods!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc06cd777ae9d9:0xf51bb043d7c50d3< /gmap_id></record>

This is a great place to shop with quite a variety of merchants and an interesting mix of people.  Its close proximity to the university adds to the flavour and cosmopolitan atmosphere, but don't let that scare you.  I consider La Jolla Village Square a "top tier" shopping experience; it's fun and rewarding in more ways than one!
I recommend that you park in the shaded, below ground structure.  There is usually plenty of angled, wide parking spaces available and your car won't get hot while you're shopping.< /Review>

This shopping center has a great variety of shops and restaurants as well as a nice Whole Foods. The main issue here is parking! It is a very popular shopping center so the parking lot is always packed</Review>

I can't hate GOING AND PARKING HERE more. There's always an ungodly amount of people, very weirdly designed parking lot and lots of anxiety involved. I think it'll be better  if you park inside the underground parking but I always remember to do that too late 😒<//review>

This is a great little mall with a lot of people really using it. I would say that the parking area looks a little dirty in a way but you know what it has the best security I have seen at any mall. Including in the underground parking, which is great because it's a little cramped above but there's a lot of parking generally there are three big areas to park and I just have to say that security is always there day and night watching every cranny and it's impressive. The AMC is good there and Trader Joe's and Poke N 1/2, a new Ramen place, two of those are hidden blow and it's just basically a real staple for the local community. Recommend.<//review>

This is the shopping mall of my childhood and boy has it changed. Almost completely catering to the wealthy clientele of the area, if you don't make six figures, you'll definitely feel out of place. It still has the ice skating rink, which is a good date spot, and a decent, if not pricey food court. Don't get me wrong, if immaculate and very nice, but for most middle class folks, there's not a selection of stores within our budget.< /text>

<text>Can only speak to AMC La Jolla Village 12 theatres and Urban Plates since it was movie and dinner.   LJVS is really more a neighborhood mall than regional.   Ralphs, Trader Joe's, Urban Plates, AMC, Mendocino Farms, couple of banks, you get the idea.   Now, if would only add a hardware store...<//text><Name>Hal</Name>< GmapID>

The best thing about this place is La Jolla dry cleaners, super convenient if you work in UTC and I can’t say enough about how awesome Suzanne and her team are!  Other then that you have over priced gas and over priced groceries. There is a Wells Fargo, one of like 3 in a 2 mile radius.  Roy’s is good if you go get the ribs!</review>

It's a nice mall except for the parking . The parking stalls are so small it's like they don't want anyone with a large vehicle to park here unless you wanna park way on the other side away from where your going.</review>

<text>We went here to eat at Urban plates.  That osrt was very good.  The parking lot layout for the entire center is strange at best and a major pain to navigate.  A hassle to get in and out of the center and actually park where you need to.  Maybe it's just typical for downtown Lajolla.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
One of the  best AMC theaters with recliners and their is a trader Joe's, next to a Starbucks and chipotle. Yes it sounds gentrified but it's next to UCSD, so it's more of an upscale college area. The fins fish tacos in the center are probably some of the best in SD, get the Ono tacos. Parking spots are super small and the escalator inside is broken and their are no stairs in the immediate area, so you have to take an elevator one floor.< /Review>

I love that I can park once and get Poke 1/2 for lunch, pick up groceries at Trader Joe's AND Ralph's, and get easily back onto the 5 south via Nobel.</Review>

Convenient as far as the different stores in the square. Often very crowded with people looking for parking spots. Probably best to park far away from where you need to go and walk.</Text>

I love the Ralph's store here, open 24 hours which is perfect because as a RN I work weird hours. Great stock, variety, and professional staff. There are many restaurants also.< /text>

<text>Usually stop here to when I need to shop at Trader Joe's. Starbucks & Ralph's are also on the same side. Restaurants and other stores are on a lower level on the other side, with a different entrance and separate parking lot.

It's an incredibly busy center.  Walking distance to UCSD and lots of apartments. The parking lot for Trader Joe's and Ralph's is the reason for this score. Narrow aisles, narrow parking spots, crazy traffic flow filled with shoppers walking back and forth through the lot.</text><response>None<//response>< pictures>

This mall has a good variety of stores. Parking it's a hassle on the side that faces the Hwy 5, keep on the other side.</Review>

Everyone forgets how to drive in the Whole Foods parking lot. Multiple times people were driving on the wrong side of the road. People don't pay attention to the parking lines on a regular basis. I've had to crawl through my passengers side to get to my seat twice and once I had to crawl through my car all the way from the back. It's ridiculous. I don't have a big car, I do know what side of the road I should be on, and I know how to park in the middle. I'm not sure when these people got their licenses, but they need to take a course. If you care about your car I recommend parking across the street by the Best Buy and walking over or else not shopping here at all.< /text>

The parking lot gets a little tricky sometimes. It would be great if the stairs to the lower level of the garage were unlocked, but they never are.< /Review>

The parking is horrible. It's a maze trying to park anywhere above ground; though there is a tremendous amount of parking underneath. The problem is that no one realizes the parking underneath.<//Text>

Parking is a nightmare...but i love the new AMC theaters. There is hidden parking underground...shhhh....Urban Plates is new and exciting. The Ralphs is really nice, but expensive. Of course, I love the trader Joes there. Lots of people from the college.</text>

<Text>I like Ralph store for fresh produce and prices are reasonable. Before X-mass they had amazing sale on Loreal and Neutrogena personal care products. I bought couple of them and enjoyed moisturzer and night cream. Unluckily, one of the Loreal day cream was sticky and dry and it was boxed properly. The box still had Ralph sticker stating-"Wow-amazing deal" I was not sure, if cashier would take it back after 3weeks and even without a receipt. YEP, they returned my money and did not ask any question. I am super happy at the courtesy of the cashier and their policy to take items back if the customer is not satisfied.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Has a mixture of business, including a 24/7 Ralph's Grocery, some good places to eat, PetSmart, and a mix of small ro large stores, and I love the AMC Theater with large comfy power reclining seats. Have also noticed some selling hard drugs around Ralph's, as they are trolling for college students looking to make a buy, so could use more security to discourage this activity.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

It has Whole Foods,CVS, Peets,Rubios and other great stores. There is plenty of parking. There is handicap parking and great access in the stores. Everyone is friendly in this quaint community. I loved the outdoor seating. I had a drink at Peets while sitting outside after I went to Whole Foods for the best salsa and chips. I bought pretty reusable bags that say San Diego California at Whole Foods. I spent a nice afternoon shopping. They have some nice eating places here too that I have not tried. I will be back.< /review>

Whoever designed this parking lot deserves an award for the parking lot I've heard the most complaints about...in my life. As somebody who doesn't drive much, and so spends most of his time walking around, the parking lot looks confusing. Seeing the many fender benders, and even a Uhaul caught on the overhead railing, suggests to me that the college students who shop here are at least as confused as I am. Located just a block away from UCSD campus, and around a 30 minute walk away from the center of campus, this is the place that students would be most likely to go once they run out of dining dollars (UCSD currency), or once they decide that UCSD food is not optimal for their learning.

Being forced to shop here means that the prices might be jacked up and we wouldn't know (and as somebody who shops here all the time, I really don't know). But the positive is that there's a lot of variety of shops. If only  there were better ways to walk around the area and make it seem more like a shopping center, and less like random shops that happen to be close together, but good luck navigating the maze to get to where you need to go.

Anyway, the shops and markets themselves are fine, really.< /Review>

Parking is the worst at La Jolla Village Square and is not very pedestrian friendly either, but besides that it is a great place to do groceries, with Trader Joes, Ralphs and Whole Foods. They also have an AMC Theatre and bus stops near it.</text>

<Review>Smaller mall with stores on either side of Nobel.  Ralphs, whole Foods, CVS and Trader Joes anchor the mall. Good selection of chain restaurants like Islands, CPK, BJ's Pizza, and Rubios. Also good specialty stores such as DSW, Best Buy, and Ross. Also has a very nice movie theater with  6 screens  and very comfortable reclining seats. I seem to find myself there at least once a week. Parking can be a little tough especially if you are trying to go to the Trader Joe's or the Whole Foods. If you park underneath the mall it's much easier.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dc06cd777ae9d9:0xf51bb043d7c50d3</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not a great place to shop for clothes, but convenient for food, grocery shopping (Ralphs and CVS), movies (AMC), banking, and electronics (BestBuy).

A one stop shop! This place has just about everything. I work in the area so I swing through here all the time on my way home. Has a Ralph's, starbucks, ulta, best buy, Ross, world market, islands resturant, and several a other shopping and food options. Across the street are more shops like Nordstrom rack, whole foods, chase bank, BJ'S resturant, CVS, peet's coffee, etc. It is also close to the 5 freeway. 2 different exits, so it is convenient and quick to get to.</Text>

Although there is a Starbucks, a Trader Joe's movies and a Ralph's here  parking is a mess I only go if I really want or need to.
There is parking underneath but little access from there to most stores</Text>

<Text>I go here mostly for Ralphs. But I avoid it when I can. The parking lot is usually full and the spots are tiny. Its very likely someone will hit their door on your car. Avoid when possible.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Parking lot SUCKS, especially if you're handicapped.  Lanes are way to narrow and twisty to constitute the slanted slots and NO handy handicapped parking.< /Text>

<Review>This parking lot and the shop layout is horrible. Its nearly impossible to go from one shop to another with out driving all around the crazy parking lot. Signs for many places aren't even on the places themselves or direct you to the stores entrance. If you've never been here before, good luck finding the movie theatre.<//Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I stopped to go to Walmart.
I stayed overnight at Lake Elsinore, so I had dinner at a nearby fast food and went home.
I went around when it was dark, so I did n’t know the scale of parking.
The wall mart itself was very big and there were many things I wanted to buy.
After all it is very cheap here.
In Japan, Seiyu is under the umbrella,
Rather than Seiyu, it feels more like Beisia in the suburbs or Joyful Honda.

(Original)
ウォールマートに行くために寄りました。
レイクエルシノアに一泊泊まったので、近くのファストフードに夕食をとって、そよ帰りに寄りました。
まわりが暗くなってから行ったので、パーキングの規模とかは良くわかりませんでしたが、
ウォールマート自体はすごく大きく広くて、買いたいものがいろいろありました。
やっぱりここはすごく安いです。
日本だと、西友が傘下にありますが、
西友というよりは郊外にあるベイシアとかジョイフル本田みたいな感じです。<//text>
