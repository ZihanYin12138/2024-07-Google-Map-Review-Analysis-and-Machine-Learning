We went to there for my second grade son's project to just cut a piece of wood, however he helped us more than just cut a wood.
I would like to appreciated he was cooperating with us and listening son's opinion as a one adult human being.  We are so satisfied, thank you again for your kindness.<//Review>< response>

<review>Had an issue with a drill bit I couldn’t figure out, called over, talked a bit on the phone, guy said come over he’d take a look.  Wasn’t easy but with several methods tried and persistence he fixed it.  Said have a great day and was on my way.  Amazing service and help, couldn’t be more appreciative of those moments from a retailer... I’ll be sending my own business, and all my friends business to Meanley and Sons now.  Thank you!!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I talked to Bob he and he was so rude. This business is awful. If they have obnoxious people like Bob working there when the only thing that one wants is for them to be attentive or corteous. I will never go back there or recommend this terrible place to anybody, they really suck!!

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This little hardware store has the feeling of a mom-and-pop store from a bygone era , surrounded as it is by fancy juiceries and expensive yoga pants. The store is tightly but efficiently packed with most everything one might need from a hardware store, and the worker who helped us locate the exact bolts and nuts we needed was so patient and friendly. It was a great experience, which admittedly seems like a weird thing to say about a hardware store, but it's true.< /Review>< Pictures>

I just heard that some loser complained to the health department about them serving FREE popcorn so now they can't do it anymore.
5 stars to this store and the employees.
A Million thumbs down to the petty sad individual that went from to the health department and ruined something nice for everyone. 😒</text>

The thing about buying tools or hardware is needing the ability to try them out before you buy. Ace, with a knowledgeable and friendly staff, has everything you need to complete your project.

They are dog friendly too! Bring your dog inside and the staff will give your furry friend a treat.<//text>

Five stars isn’t really enough to describe the interaction I had with them. They let me come in with my dog, and took the time to test, explain, and let me borrow a product even though they were not able to make any money from the interaction. They clearly care more about people than profit.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Meanley's is a small treasure of a hardware store located in a fashionable La Jolla district.  They seem to have anything one needs, even if only remotely related to hardware, paints, and maintenance.  Whether you require a 10 cent bolt or a $500 paint order,  the staff will cheerfully help you find  what you need.  Furthermore,  the large staff, all professionals, take care of you immediately as you enter the store and  are very generous with good advice.  This is important to "do it yourselfers" as myself for whom every household project is a new learning experience.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
Meanley's is a wonderful store in the center of La Jolla where one can find most of the practical things needed around the home or garden: paint, nails, screws, tools, hardware, electrical materials, Swiss army knives, cooking pots, cleaning supplies, mouse traps, etc.  The store is of modest size but their inventory is huge, and 95% of the time, one finds what one needs.  Probably the best part, though, is that you don't need to search by yourself.  The store's staff is very friendly and  incredibly helpful, especially with sage advice, which is worth a trip to the store by itself.  This store is a gem on Girard!</review>

Horrible service when they have the morning crew. When they DON'T recognize the name of a product, even though you've bought it there before, they claim to not carry it....again, and again. When you call and they don't want to bother with you, and recognize your phone number, they hang up on you. So I have decided to discontinue buying from them. That is the beauty if capitalism.......choices, lots of choices.</text>

Terrible employees. Kevin is the only decent one but he let's his employees drink and smoke on the job. Because of this, one of the newest employees was under the influence while working on my hair and instead of trimming for a combover, he used a machine and cut everything off leaving me bald headed. I am furious and I do not recommend ever going to this place.</review>

Barbers that I've gotten a haircut from were great and precise. All I'd say is that they pay attention a bit to when customers come in for a cut. Yeah they acknowledge most of the time but sometimes they forget who has been waiting longer.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I like to give every place the benefit of the doubt so I been there a couple times.  Like every other comment, lack of customer service, never open on time, and they do not keep track of who next in line. Lastly, and probably the worse was when the barber's buddies show up with beers and vaping while 4-5 children of other customers are present. I understand its and "adult" barber shop, but it's still a business. Will not be returning.< /Text>< Pics>

I don't like Barber shops but I go because of my boy's. I got there 30 min before closing time when they were closing they did say they would cut my boys hair. I still waited and all the guys that cut hair were cleaning and leaving one by one when two guys left we were still waiting. They finally told me that they weren't going to cut my son hair because the guy that was going to do it had left. I just got up and left not happy because they made me wait almost a hour for nothing. If they would of said no when I got there I would of had time to find another place that was open.< /Review>

I got a pedicure and the toenails weren't even straight and when I asked her to fix it she told me to wait outside. She wouldn't even let me sit there for my toenails to dry before I left and then gave me nail filers so I can fix it myself. $30 is not worth the service they're giving!<//Text>

I am not an expert in this area but as a "Rookie" I wanted to find a nice, mid-range fee shop. Mid-week, walked in and was taken immediately. Feet & legs serviced first while I received an automated chair massage. Then onto serving my hands. As I reviewed my surroundings I observed spiderwebs (removed a star), otherwise the shop is clean. They used tools opened from a sterilized bag, new tub liner was installed into the foot tub, wore safely gloves 🧤 and face mask when necessary. Would I return again for another round of services, absolutely!</Review><gmap_id>0x80d95a3d5fd519ef:0x49a307107f777ae9</gmap_id>< rating>

Coming from a different city, I was hoping that I’d have a good experience here in San Diego, instead it was probably the worst experience I’ve had getting my nails done and other services as well. I had called and asked if they had an opening for my nails and I asked if they offer massage services for my sister, in which they said over the phone that they offered massage services $1 per minute and they had an opening to get my nails done. When I got there, the owner Cindy very rudely said that they didn’t offer massage services and that I had probably called the wrong salon, when they had me down on schedule! I had to get my nails done so I stayed anyway, few minutes later, one of the workers asked if my sister wanted to do the massage even after Cindy said that they didn’t offer such services. I was very confused as to why Cindy made me sound crazy that I asked about massage services, I was confronting Cindy about what she told me earlier and as I was talking to her she rudely rolled her eyes and walked away!! Even after that experience I stayed because I needed to get my nails done. The girl that was doing my manicure gave me multiple cuts on my fingers and kept filing my skin even after I asked her to be more gentle. I had the worst experience here and all I wanted was to get my nails done instead I got tortured.</review>

The prices are too much.. i had gel change   no manicure they changed me $24. The Other places like Nail Time it is $15. The change of color on my toes no pedicure they changed $12. I called 2 other places and it was $8, and $10.
Thus, I do  not suggest this place to others just the price wise. The nails job is not bad. But again not everyone are doing the same great job.< /text>

Clean and reliable; expert techs. They are NOT afraid to take out your ingrown nails like most places and I LOVE that. I wear boots so this is common for me. I tried going to different places, but they're not as good as here. I've gone back 4 times and will continue to.<//Review>

Asked for guy to correct the very uneven polish on nails and cuticles. Seemed irritated and it still looks bad after they tried to correct, maybe it was just my nail guy. Others at salon may be good but I will certainly not be going back.< /Text>< Pics>

My girlfriend and I really like this place. Why? When you call to make your appointment they always nice. When you get there they ask you if you want something to drink while they’re doing the job. Good customer service. Try it is worth it. You won’t be disappointed.<//Review>

<text>Love the staff here! I’m very picky about my nails and they always make sure they are done to my satisfaction with no complaints. Even though I’m horrible at scheduling an appointment, they are always able to squeeze me in on my lunch break. I work right upstairs so it’s super convenient. Would definitely recommend going here!!!<//text>< response>

I got the #2 spa pedicure with the salt scrub and the mud mask. It was to die for. So relaxing and Timmy did an awesome job on my pedicure. I had one crooked toenail but it's not too bad. My gel manicure is amazing.<//Review>

Had a great experience here. Only went once so far (about a week ago) but definitely plan to return. Brought my mom and grandma. We all got the "full bar" for both our feet and hands and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We did not have appointments but did arrive shortly after they opened on a weekday and were seated right away. Offerred mimosas and water. Very impressed with their cleanliness and friendly personas.

Bonus: a week later and my toes still look like the day I had them done despite crawling around a kids' amusement center, hiking, and wandering around barefoot more often than not. That is spectacular for me. Usually things are chipped beyond repair by now.<//Review>

Tina is my go to nail technician. But last time she wasn't available and ended up with another lady. She cut me 3 times because she was in a hurry. She apologize but I would appreciate more delicacy and attention since their prices are not cheap. I want their services to reflect the prices they charge. Quality. I don't know if I am going to go back, but if I do, I'll make sure to get Tina.<//text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><GmapID>0x80d95a3d5fd519ef:0x49a307107f777ae9</GmapID><Text>I made an appointment for 2 pedicures on a Sunday for my best friend and myself. We arrived on time. Waited 10 mins for a spot. Which I understand because their were only 3 girls working. We waited another 25 mins soaking and my friend started to recieve her pedicure. I hour later I was still soaking. Nobody was available and yet they never said anything?? Kelly who was doing my friends pedicure said I will do you next. The reason customers make appts is so this doesnt happen. I couldn't  stay longer as we had already been there 1.5hrs. There was a small apology to me walking out of there with no pedicure but very well soaked feet.  They told me the owner called with 2 appointments at the same time and that's why I didnt recieve service. I tried to call Bella 3 times but they said she is not there. I have gone here many times and have liked it but I fear the owner may have sold the business and the new people are not very communicative. If they would have called and said we accidently overbooked, I would have gone somewhere else.<//Text>< Pics>

I absolutely love the service here. There was one time I had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated but I showed up during rush hour so it was expected. They serve mimosas and offer free Wi-Fi to paying customers. The pedicure is very thorough but not overly invasive. I would, however, advise against using the spa tub as a trash can. A nail tech threw her banana peel in it while I was still sitting in the chair. (There was no water but still..). Overall this is my go to place.</Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Came here with my sister-in-law, we called ahead and they said they weren't busy.  We arrived and they weren't. Only half of the pedicure chairs were full,  and nail technicians were standing around talking to eachother.  Got our eyebrows done after standing around for 5 minutes waiting.  Then I was instructed to sit in the pedicure chair and my sister-in-law to the manicure station. After 15 mins of sitting in cold water,  the owner came over to start on my pedicure and then one of her regulars walked in with her daughter and proclaimed they had no appointment, the owner that was working on my nails stopped immediately and began working on the other woman's nails without saying a word to me. I again sat in my chair for nearly 10 minutes and  I was about to leave when a male technician was called to come out from the back,  he proceeded to work on my nails and only removed my polish and again stopped on mine without saying a word and started to work on the woman's daughter's nails. On top of being treated so poorly,  the quality of the work is definitely not woeth the price.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Friday $ 5 for parking $ 5 to enter.  for not wanting to park my car in an unsafe place because the park was already full.  They want to charge me $ 5 to enter.  The security guy has never been charged to see that he does not pay for the parking he wants to pay to enter.  when you have never been paid to enter here.<//Review>

Nope nope nope I called this place I had barley finished saying hello and this lady was all like (  ven acá Alameda porque yo no sé inglés ) didn’t give me a chance to speak what I wanted to say and I speak 5 languages (Spanish, English, French, Russian, and German ) i called speaking English she could’ve said if I knew Spanish Instead of giving me attitude and hanging up my daddy can ruin your business so be careful who you talk to like that!! Bye!! Xoxo😌< /Review>

The food is decent for a Bar/Strip Club. Beer is at a decent price. The Bartender is a great conversationalist. Dont remember her name. Now to the girls. they obviously follow the money. so i decided to ask for one of their $15 min Lap Dance. Very courteous. Paid and got it. while this was going on she said if i wanted another one. which i said yes. near the end of the dance she call a different Bartender than the one I was talking to and decided to order alcohol. She state it a way that i would be paying. She orders a $12 shot of tequila. I said no she can get a beer. Then sits next to me and asked for the m9ney for the other two extra dances i got. I immediately said no we agreed on one. Went to speak with the people that seemed to be in charge. They werent. Another stripper defended the girl stating that the guest is suppose to say stop and keep track of how many songs are going by. To which i stated i agreed on 2 dances. I ended up  not paying for the alcohol she ordered and payed for what i agreed on and left. GENTLEMAN, BE CAREFUL WITH THE STRIPPERS HERE. YOU CAN GO TO SAMS AFTER DARK AND GET MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE STAFF AND BETTER QUALITY GIRLS AND ITS A SHORT DRIVE FROM THIS PLACE</Text>

<Text>Came here and sat ourselves because not one employee acknowledged we were here or at least didn’t care. Went to ask a waiter if she can help us and told me she would get someone. 30 min later a girl literally starts her conversation with “ nobody has helped you huh” haha this place is a joke people.

Got to practice my Spanish. No cover but $5 for parking. Came to here after spending an hour at Dames n Games.< /review><userid>116322637317519736538< /userid><Time>1513409063745</Time><user_name>Chaleman R< /user_name></record>

Meh.. this place must have been busted for doing tricks in the past because the dances are so uncomfortably boring.  They watch over all the dances like a hawk to make sure you are not enjoying yourself.  Don't go for a dance.  It's super boring and uncomfortable.

I will give them credit for having some cute girls. It's a place with a variety of sizes.  If you like big Butts they have that.  If you like tiny Butts they have that too.  What they don't have is privacy.  It's like a remodeled discotecha in TJ or the resort towns in Mexico, but without the fun.< /Text>

We Have been looking for a new shop since our old one closed. stopped at Cannavine up the road first And was horribly disappointed so we decided to drive up the road to Revolution. Immediately I could tell this was a good place. It’s small and surrounded by plants which had been labeled with different terpene names. Obviously knowledgeable 👍 Couldn’t go inside because of covid but was greeted warmly by the male bud tender at a small window. He showed us the sign of what was available and the ounce and half ounce deals. We asked if we could see the actual weed and he said some of it was in solid containers so you can’t see through them. He then told us about the cannabis inside, letting us know the look, smell and sharing he had tried it and it was really good. He obviously was very knowledgeable about the dispensaries  products and was a great help. This is a cash only shop but they do have an atm in the back you can use, one person at a time. This shop has a nice welcoming vibe and good prices for chronic weed. Sales tax is about 7 and a half % which is great seeing as Mendocann in hopland is 30%. Definitely making this our go to shop and I highly recommended it to anyone looking for good cannabis and good customer service.<//text>

< Review>
staff are always kind. one time i got an 1/8th with hella seeds in it (not their fault). I called to let them know so they could possibly let the flower company know. They told me if I brought the 1/8th back, they would replace it. This was unexpected, very considerate, and great customer service! They have good deal aswell, always something good from Revolution!< /Review>

Small & Mighty! What a selection packed into this one stop shop! With a quaint little lounge, and everything you could want cannabis wise to smoke in the lounge, revolution emporium is all you need when you’re driving through Ukiah! As an Account Manager for Heavy Hitters, I have the pleasure of stopping into Revolution often, and I am always greeted with the positive vibes of the friendliest budtenders. The kind of guys who remind you of your best buds, this is a great place for all your cannabis needs!< /Text>

<review>I WAS a good customer here. However, I will NEVER go there again. They overcharged me $45, but when I called back the nice girl took 100% responsibility and assured me they'd make it good. She told me exactly what I'd be getting, we agreed, and she was going to throw in an extra 1/8 for the hour and a half we would have to drive there and back. I sent my daughter back to get it but when she got there the deal had changed. Suddenly the prices were different and we weren't getting the eighth because she had taken one off the receipt (that was not why we were getting the eighth - it was because her overcharging wasted our time and gas) I even talked to the boss on the phone and he wouldn't budge. SO NOW I've used some product and this is the second one that looks small. I look more closely, and 3 of the 7 GRAMS I got are HALF GRAMS. I thought that was the case while I had the guy on the phone but I must have picked up one of the grams when I went to check. So now I've consumed 2 and all I'm about to have left is this picture. What a disappointment all around. Sad waste of a good customer.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Not sure what day of the week I should've gone because my experience here was very disappointing. This was my first time going into a dispensary so I was pretty overwhelmed and wasn't sure what would help with my personal struggles with anxiety and sleep. The staff was very unhelpful and I left more confused then when I walked in. The lady at the door was the only saving grace, she was a joy to talk to and has a pretty positive energy,  Would have been one star otherwise.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1515093831208, 'text': 'Im very sorry about your experience.

<Review>Overall, i was very pleased with the experience at bay animal hospital. I walked into the place on Sunday, and my dog was treated well. The only reason I'm giving 4 star is due to a little higher pricing compared to average, but that didn't bother me at all. I will come back in the future.< /Review>< Name>

<text>Dr Goodell saved our dogs life. She is a 9 and a half year old female fawn boxer. She was off and I knew it and regular vet wasn’t giving me the answers I wanted. I researched extensively and found Dr Goodell. We went in for her physical and to explain of her lethargy and Dr found a heart arrhythmia that other vets had missed. Now it was a tricky one to hear admittedly by Dr Goodell and the cardiologist too but Dr Goodell heard it first. The Drs genuine curiosity and care is why, I remember thinking he’s listening to her heart for way longer than any other vet, that’s why he heard it. DCM is becoming epidemic in large breed dogs and he was all over it. Forever grateful. Olivia ended up being in the very early stages of heart failure, she spent two nights hospitalized and is now on heart meds and doing pretty well. She will be with us for Christmas and we are going on 3 months of borrowed time. I can’t say thank you enough. I read stories of other people loosing dogs suddenly to dcm and it breaks your heart. Now Olivia gets to be an old lady and have some awesome senior time. Not have some tragic life ending event. We are forever grateful!</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbGpo8DIczgmpuhY6IZt_18XThYBs2mXdcUp_j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrrX6IvrvARFTS4-tBO4Q265scsnCsQesqyazs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHqv3Y5D6oF5RHk2WlbsugJnBY5Ey4qmfnvZ4N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO81_hVkFLFFgD5cfjWEgM_LVHRBYyiPNsDPLFO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8YTL_fOssr9OfTfqFCXZ3UkLlR5PfZqpB9VYm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO17c7wDR4zC5r9j_Guz2M0z_PYtCkGcye736is=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I cannot say enough good things about Bay Animal Hospital.

My husband and I recently moved to the South Bay and we were panicked when our 7 month old puppy swallowed a toy (!) last weekend. Bay Animal Hospital was able to squeeze us in for an early morning appointment, and Dr. Gunderson gave our boy top notch care. They were able to get the toy out quickly and kept us updated throughout the process.

Everyone we spoke to at the front desk (Alma, Jessica) was super sweet. We are so grateful to be new patients. Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>The doctors here have been so great.  We moved from Manhattan, New York and my elderly chihuahua has been in a tough spot for some time.  Dr. Bailey helped us manage his pain and was always responsive and compassionate.  Today the suffering was too much and we had to put my Chihuahua down.  Even during COVID the staff was understanding and sympathetic to our situation.  I was able to be there at the end with my pup and the staff and Dr. Santielo were great.  As sad as this day was, they made it less difficult with their compassion and caring.  Thank you.  As a medical professional I attest their bedside manner is an A+.< /Text>< response>

I spoke to Doctor that was great.
They gave us options what we can do.
They made Cozy and  myself feel special.

I've been going to my other vet for over 10 years and every time I would go, I'd still have to wait for over 30 minutes even with an appointment.  Everyone that works at Bay Animal Hospital was so professional, friendly and had a smile on their faces.  The place is spotless!  While I was there I noticed someone coming to disinfect the seats as soon as the other customers left.  All in all, it was quite a wonderful experience.< /Text>< pics>

Hands down, the BEST veterinarian experience we've ever had and Frankie gets genuinely excited to see your staff. You have always gone above and beyond to make sure our worries and anxieties about Frankie are extinguished and reassure us that he's truly in good hands. The doctors & staff always explain things in a clear, concise and understandable way. Bedside manner, A++. Boarding, A+++++.

< Review>
This is one of the very best vets in LA county, and through the years I've been to a few.  Dr. Goodell and his staff are professional, caring and are much more about the care and comfort of your pet, than the money.  I've been going to them for three years now with two cats.  I have trust in them and highly recommend them.< /Review>

The staff are incredibly friendly here, Doctor Shin is fantastic. Interactions with the staff and Doctor are beyond the usual check up, it's clear they love animals and take pride in making your animal healthy and comfortable in their space. Do your best to make an appointment. There is a large waiting area with two sides (good if you need to keep an animal separate), and hooks for leashes. Overall a great vet!<//Text>< pics>

<username>Ashley Craig<//username><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5</rate><Review>I can’t say enough good things about Bay Animal Hospital. I have owned pets my entire life and have never experienced the level of personalized service that I do with Bay. For run of the mill issues, I always get a call following up on how my pet is doing after the appointments. But what has really impressed me is the level of dedication from Dr Sean Goddell for our more challenging situations (diabetes, ring worm, epilepsy, etc). I have received many calls from him after hours, on a Friday evening, checking up on our pets, providing tests results or giving me other information. We have three cats and three dogs and we receive very individualized and comprehensive care for all of them. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful as well.< /Review></record>

The doctors at Bay are fantastic! They listen to my concerns about my dogs' health, take the time to examine them thoroughly and then explain my options fully so I can make educated decisions. They are also sensitive to my feelings when the decisions have been difficult. I trust them completely and always recommend them highly.< /review>

Been coming here for 3 years and very solid service and care.  Regarding the prices being high, well "duh".  This is in one of richest parts of the country and to think it would be cheap is ludicrous.  If the care and service is good to great, then it is worth the convenience of not driving in traffic and supporting local business.< /review>

Since the remodle, i feel there is new manegemnt, new vets, and staff. I have been coming here since 2004, and now no one there knows me, if i ask for my old vet, they seem to always be busy, or not scheduled. Starting to have doubts. This is my 5th dog with them, but might need a new place to go.<//Review>

The very moment I arrived they took my cat away to check him.  I had called earlier amd told then that my cat has a hisory of bladder blockage, and knowing that's a life threatening condition they wasted no time.  That was awesome of them!
Turns out he wasn't blocked, but to find out what was the matter, they were ultra thorough.
And Dr. Shin is THE BEST!!!
After being treated pretty badly by a vet not too long before (at another clinic!), her awesome bedside manner really stood out.
5 stars all the way!!  Hopefully you'll get Dr. Shin!</text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Bay Animal is extremely dependable, thorough, honest and knowledgeable. As far as pricing...when it comes to my dog, I'm not shopping around for the cheapest care. I'm shopping for a facility and vets that are reliable, knowledgable, comforting and TRUSTWORTHY.  When you bring an animal in for any reason, it's never going to be free. I highly recommend Bay Animal and Dr. Goodell.</review>< Resp>

<Review>This place is the best place to live, the people are wonderful, everyone looks out for each other, and its everyone who lives here that makes it a great place, I love this place and if you are able to move here, you would love it too. And if you want a busy life style,  this is the place, they have Bingo, pot lucks, karaoke, crafts, bible study, card games, exercise class, and much much more, including free laundry room, pool and Jacuzzi,  along with a fitness room, a game room with pool table, and shuffle Board, and if you need help, they are here for you, it's a great place to be a part of.

I think it's nice but the people whom they place responsibilities on let them go to head.  They need to be more compassionate with the people who have pets in the park.< /Review>

Its a trail park so the seniors get more of a home for home enviorment. Which i feel is a better living for elderly folks. An not like hospitals where elderly folks dont get any privacy, its a cold room, no matter how big or small the room is. The nurse or dr's come an go as they please, even if u have a visitor. An i know im not the only person who think.... when anyone no matter the age, is admitted in the hospital. U most always feel so lonely, like ur the only soul there. When im a senior elderly, i wouldnt want to be in a hospital when im
Old an have few little time left. I hope i live in a place like the Ramrod Senior Housing.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Sometimes I think I should get something other than the al pastor. I am always wrong. Only other downside to the awesome food truck is that they use nacho cheese sauce instead of real cheese for the nachos. But the toppings were so good I almost didn't care.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Delicious (and cheap) tacos! We ordered 8 for $12, and every bite was delicious. The tacos are small, but they were generous with the meat.

It’s a popular spot, so there is a bit of a wait. Be sure to order as much as you think you will want.

Note that it is cash only (there is an ATM at the gas station across the street).< /review>

It gave me nostalgia of eating tacos de pastor in mexico city as a kid. Also the tacos de cabeza were great with the red salsa. The salsa had an amazing smoky flavor and the yellow corn tortillas are a nice touch.

I just order two meals and beverages from Wahoo's Fish Tacos on Camino Los Mares with Door Dash.

When the driver was approaching the house I could see he was carrying only one beverage. I asked him where other drink was at and he said the Wahoo's employee said everything was there.

I checked the bag and thought I saw it, but was only the lid to the salsa.

I called the restaurant and the employee that answered the phone said I got my drink, accused me of lying, and said I was a bad customer.

I asked to speak with a manager and he told that there wasn't one. When I pressed for the managers name he then said he was the manager. I then asked what his name was and he said Chris. I assumed he was lying to me again and asked him if he was. He told me he was lying about his name too.

I acknowledged that mistakes happen all the time with delivery orders. His response was "then why would ever order take out"? I told this was worst customer service I have ever received and he again called me a bad customer.

We have dined at this Wahoo's location several times and never received such horrible customer service. I plan on sharing this regretful experience with the real manager once I learn who that is with the hope that they can correct the problem for future patrons.

We will not be visiting this restaurant ever again. I still can't believe I was accused of lying about receiving a $2.30 iced tea. I tried to explain to the very rude employee that I wouldn't have even called if the order had been delivered correctly.

Wahoo's just lost a local family as a customer over an iced tea. I will share this on the Next Door app and with all our neighbors.< /Review>

<Text>I wished this restaurant was on the East coast. While visiting Dana Point,  California I ordered delivery the food was delicious. During my stay I ate there every day.
The fish taco was my first order, I didn't take a picture because I ate it so fast....lol.

Every meal was fresh and flavorful.  The staff is very friendly and the service is fast.

I recommend highly recommend Wahoo's Fish Taco and I hope that they open restaurants on the East Coast.<//Text>< pics>

I had a bowl with brown rice, black beans, and fish ( Uno). It was delicious. Also had a fish taco that was just as good as my bowl. All the food looks good plus the staff is super friendly. Overall had a great experience. I have also tried the one in Laguna Hills.<//review>

SUCH great food! I saw this restaurant on the food network years ago and have wanted to go. Finally made it, and the wait was worth it! The ono fish tacos were delicious, and I added avocado - a nice complement. Kids loved their food as well!< /Text>

Great food here! The two enchilada plate with green sauce, white beans and white rice is my favorite. If you want a low-carb option the Paleo bowl is pretty awesome.
Their fried fish tacos are pretty good if you don’t mind the extra calories. When it’s cold out if it’s soup is a pretty good option also. Pretty lean and healthy. They recently added a salsa bar so you can try many of their sauces they put on top of their dishes.
Pretty good move!< /text>

I have eaten at other Wahoos and they all have same bad food.

I used to live by the OG location in Costa Mesa. I know what good Wahoos tastes like. Even the sauces have changed to a more watered down version.< /Review>< Pics>

We planed on a great taco from this San Clemente restaurant since it is their "signature dish" ,  Only two on the menu.  What a disappointment  DRY, over loaded with cabbage, and a couple of little pieces of dry fish.  They should go to Mexico and find out how to make fish tacos.

Kevin, My name is on the credit card I used to buy your tacos.< /text>

The food is great, great healthy options like a grilled chicken bowl with black beans and brown rice. Or do the protein bowl add some shrimp in there with some slices of avocado, you got yourself a cookout right there:)</Text>

Has a great skate and surfer atmosphere when you go in. The food was awesome. Completely fresh and what is lost in most other restaurants with the reheated frozen food from the freezer. They make everything from scratch including the salsa and guacamole sauce for your chips. I love eating in places that take pride in quality. Try it!!!<//Text>

Tried there paleo bowl with all grilled fish. Didn't choose it for health reasons. It just sounded good. It tasted great.  Wahoo's isn't as good as it used to be many years ago, but it's still one of the better fast food places out there.</Text>

Wahoo's is great wherever you go.  This location is extra special because Roberto, the manager, and his team makes everyone feel special.  We recommend their Fish Tacos, Baja Rolls and Maui Rings.</review>

Just a regular ol' Wahoos. Good food on the cheap if you've never been to one. If you have, it is exactly like all the other Wahoos. Maui bowl is the way that I go but pretty much everything is good. My wife said that they recently upped their game with the salads so if you are down to graze, they might not be a bad way to to.<//Text>

I have had multiple negative experiences with this gas station. I stay close by, and on occasion have needed gas, snacks, or most recently, change for about $3 in quarters.

I’ve had a pump fail after paying (two times in a row), only to have the old oriental lady/owner(?) at the front yell at me that it was definitely all my fault and to ‘move if you don’t like it.’

I’ve come in for snacks in the past, to be yelled at from the front of the store for pouring myself some coffee and picking up a pastry.. before I could even pay for them.

Today, in need of quarters for a meter, and determined to keep at simple as humanly possible, I walked in with $4, picked up a can of Arizona Tea (looks like everyone already understands this place refuses to help you unless you jump through all their hoops), and asked to break the remaining $2 and change into quarters. “We don’t have quarters here, no breaking dollars.” Seriously? Does this place WANT to go out of business??< /review>

Worst and rude cannot describe how disgusting this place is. The owner especially the lady I guess she has some mental problems, if you think I’m joking then check other reviews. Do not buy yourself angry at this place, just avoid. Even it’s located at a good spot but trust me, u won’t go there twice.< /Text>

The owner, a woman, and the big guy at the register really don't know how to interact with people. They are rude and haughty, not at all pleasant or helpful. Even though I buy premium Shell gas for my car and live within two blocks of this station I don't patronize it.</review>

Owners will nickel and dime you every chance they get. I purchased fuel and requested to use the air pump, at which point the woman came out to the pump and yelled at me saying I didn't spend enough on gas. Unfortunately for her, the law doesn't set a minimum fuel amount for air, and they don't have the toll free complaint number posted, which is a violation of state law. Take your business elsewhere.</Text>

Owners can come across very rude, however if you know exactly what you want, go in, and out without really talking they are fine. If you do not, they will follow you around the store and harass you. They are just interested in your business, nothing else. If they did not have costco muffins I would never stop in there. I would not recommend this location at all.</text>

<Text>Clearly one of the worst gas station and Customer service. The owners are extremely rude and disrespectful. They don’t care if their gas pump was broken and they will yell at you if you just stop a few sec or use the bathroom. As an Asian myself i’m shame of that Asian couple. Absolutely speechless, do u guys know how to speak like a human being? Just because your location is kinda good does not mean you can be rude and have zero customer service. Screw you. Plz do not come, they don’t deserve your money.<//Text><username>Shengyuan Liu< /username><UserId.>106271135899856142116<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80857e82ab1fce37:0x6f7743b02d7758b0< /GmapID><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

Awful and super rude owners. I paid at the pump and filled the tank up, but somehow the gauge on my car showed no change. I went in to ask the lady to check if there was anything wrong with the pump machine, but she yelled at me and did not even try to look at the pump. I didn't want to waste my time talking to the lady, so went to another gas station and filled the tank up. Obviously, there was nothing wrong with my car and the gauage was charged up to. I was awfully disappointed at how the owners treat their customers. Worst gas station I've ever been to.</text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>I am I 13 year old boy and i use my moms card sometimes. The owner, man, always puts everything for me on a calculator instead of the register and refuses to give me a receipt. Plus my auntie always tell a story of being me and my little brother there (who was probably 2 at the time) we had to use the bathroom. The owner, woman, said that the bathroom was only for customers. My auntie was a lil annoyed but she bought some gum cause we had to use the bathroom BAD!! The last then informed my auntie they she had to buy/or pay at least $1 for each person to use the bathroom!!?? So u want her to pay $3 to just use the bathroom??!! With 2 small children almost going to pee their pants?? That place is overpriced and unethical!!<//text>< date>

<text>The owners of this place seem to nickle and dime every customer visiting this gas station.

The Valero at Shattuck & University or the Chevron at Shattuck & Ashby are less than a mile away and provide better alternatives for drivers and will be 10-30 cents less per gallon than this gas station.

Even if you buy gas the owners will still try to charge you to use the air/water pump and tell you you need to pay up.  By law, if you buy gas you're not supposed to pay extra for using air or water.  Once you tell them this they'll hand over a token.

The soapy water and squeegees provided are just regular water buckets that are usually murky and just dirty up your windshield more.

The prices here for snacks / drinks will also be much higher compared to the prices at other local gas stations in Berkeley.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<UserId.>115767442502349252289<//UserId.><Review>Worst Human beings possible working at this location...

We stopped as my 10 year old daughter had to use the bathroom really bad. My wife took her in and was told that we had to make a purchase because "BATHROOMS WERE FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY" Mind you, we are from out of town and did not know the area.

So I turned my car around and pulled it to the pump so she could use the restroom...
As I am pumping gas, this little Asian woman came out to the pump that I was using. I had just gotten my card approved for debit and she began yelling at me at the top of her lungs!!! "BATHROOM FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY! NEXT TIME YOU PEE YOUR PANTS! I DONT CARE! YOU WHOLE FAMILY OF LIARS!!! YOU KIDS LIE!!! YOU LIE!!!" BUT I BOUGHT GAS FROM THEM FOR THE USE OF THE BATHROOM!!!

Totally unprofessional and horrible!!! I bought gas so they could use the restroom.

My question is, How are you going to turn a little kid down for using the restroom? I'm thinking of contacting the Shell corporation.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Eric Starcher< /Name>< resp>

Yes i was little tired but they don't have yell at me to go home and take a nap. They thought I had fallen asleep because I happened to be in there for 5 - 10 mins.

<review>Stopped for some gas and a bathroom and the lady working the counter really rude. She wouldn't give me the key to the bathroom because she said that I was not a customer even though I did fill up gas by that point. After she saw that I did buy the gas she continued to mumble something mean instead of an apology. That was today February 20th around 6:30 p.m.<//review>< Response>

Large playground with slides and swings gets hot during midday. Baaketball courts, baseball field, workout area, and large grassy area. BBQ pits available by a few of the picnic tables. Park is open sunrise to sunset. There is also a community center and free lunch for kids 18 and under is available during the summer.<//Review>< name>

Always beautiful and inviting, this park has cool recreation options like the water features that draw the kids and basketball court that is usually in use by the guys.  Shady big trees, picnic tables, parking and a super huge grass area to run around on round it out.< /Review>

<Review>Great park has plenty of space and lots of features. It's a water park during summer days. Full playground as well as offers outdoor work out equipment for those adults looking to get in shape. If you're looking for some barbecue action there are a few built in barbecues just need to bring some charcoal.  Picnic tables are plenty< /Review><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c327d44c137a8d:0x6ebdebf3b87c53fa< /gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1603062971863< /Time>< user_name>

<Review>I crossed through the park when walking home after my car broke down. The shade was delightful, the grass was soft and springy. The drinking fountains were a little too far out of my zombie - like trajectory to be of use to me, but I still give the park five stars because it's a very nice park even when I haven't walked two miles in boots with 2-inch heels and carrying a laptop.  I recommend.

Mind you, a drinking fountain out under the trees would make a lovely accent.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c327d44c137a8d:0x6ebdebf3b87c53fa</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I practically lived here when I was a kid.  The park is much cleaner now (no more human excrement to watch out for - always a plus), the toys are newer and pretty cool, and the water play area makes me totally jealous. The sheriffs patrol the park pretty regularly, which is nice. This isn't a bad neighborhood, but it's still nice that they do that.

I really want to play in that water play area.<//Review>

Wonderful park to hang out with friends or for a nice sunny walk alone. Basketball courts, baseball field, large grassy area, good number of benches. Usually full of people which can’t help but uplift your spirits. Small water park for children during the summer make this park super unique<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Great family park. There is a water pad, playground, baseball diamond and exercise area. There are covered picnic tables. They have a rec center with sports sign ups. This is a great place to sign up if your little ones aren't yet into big organized sports or are just trying their hand at a new sport. The Easter egg hunt is fun. My kids enjoy the free summer lunches and movie nights. What I like most is that the playground always has other kids for my children to play with. Most of the families frequent often enough that you can become familiar with them. It's a welcoming fun place to be.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
Impressive how much they cram into this small space! Not at all a large park but it's got just about everything you could want, plus its own miniature water park (which is rad but seems like a bit much on cold days). Only con is the small parking lot, but in all fairness that's to be expected in such a small area. Besides, I can't hate on any park that's got multiple full basketball courts😍< /Review>

Great place for kids with special needs 😁
A special swing and a ramp to access the play equipment
I was really impressed by the thought that went into this play ground as I have special needs children myself
I really appreciate whoever built this place 😁</text>

This is a nice place to bring your family and friends. There's an exercise area, Baseball diamond, a soaking wet play area, a Daycare center and clubhouse. You can run or walk and workout. The Neighborhood is nice and well kept. A good park for parties or group's. There's handicapped access and parking and public restrooms.< /Review>

<Text>Been going here for some time. Had my sons birthday parties several times. The water park is nice. I've seen some other throughout my neighborhood and this is by far the biggest, and cleanest. They have a decent workout area that my son and I stop on occasion midway through our morning run. Restrooms are clean, park is clean. Though, reservations for any of the tables is beyond comprehension of what one must pay and go through to get a table. Other than that, very nice.<//Text>< pictures>

My child had fun but there were some people there that seemed shady, especially the two that came out of the restroom smoking pot. But overall good place to cool off. However parking is horrible on the weekend.  We parked on the street half a block away.< /text>

<text>Nice park to take the kids to. In the summertime they have water future to let the kids run around in and a big playground. It's also a good place to exercise as an adult.

Great park,  but watch your kids there are some wannabe gang kids who hang and bully other kids at park. Over all nice programs from the community center during the summer. Free lunches.< /Text>

We were told we couldn't use our folding tables, folding chairs, or propane BBQ (they said charcoal was safer 🤔🤔). We could only use their pre established table areas which suck because there's only 2 in each area.... This park has so many new rules, it has changed and not for the better. Another party had a taco man that came and was told to leave.</Text>

Loads of fun, especially for kids from 1-10.  Water park is wheelchair accessible.  The playground equipment and floor get hot, shoes or sandles are a must.< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>One of the best park..! So much fun for the kids and us parents enjoying our childrens play.

We were driving by one day. And came across with the park.

We leave in victorville hight desert.
And we come to this park...because is so nice.

We like the water playing area , the play ground .also the equipment to exircise.

Is Freeeee... Here we don't need a member ship to work out.

My family and i wish there was a park like
Dalton park In victorville..

We want to thanks the city for such a good work with thier comunity..!!

You guys are the BEST.."< /Review>< Name>

<text>(Translated by Google) It's a park with the biggest playground near my house. Although the floor isn't a soft urethane, it's so good for children to play with the fun, the lawn, and the often seen snow caps :)
