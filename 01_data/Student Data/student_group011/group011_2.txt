<Review>After having 10 yards of bark delivered, and being very happy with it. we decided to use this same company for a delivery of rock. Ours was a small amount 1/2 yard of their 4x8 cobble (5x8 on the website). We were to use this for a boarder on our river bed in the back yard. We looked at the pictures online and decided, based on the pictures, this was the rock size we needed. What was delivered was a WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY!
What they dumped on our street was severely broken and either much larger or much smaller than what was depicted on their website. We are left with a huge pile of small (2-3 inch) and large (9-18 inch) broken rocks that we cannot use. I have made several attempts asking them correct the issue but they are unwilling to do anything. Today Virginia told me to "We are not going to do anything. Have a nice life!"
We are elderly and left with a huge pile of junk rock that we can neither move or use!
TERRIBLE, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I have to be a customer for this place about 3 years . Like their all supply and materials they have and respect all people who  work hard their for their business . Except Manager Pete  having his rude attitude to customers . Whatever I purchased any materials from him he giving me a hard time pretending don’t understand me what I want . Today literally he said to shut up to me  . I tried to be nice with him even ask for his name . And he shout I’m the manager here . Well I would not expect that from such a manager like he introduce himself . Leave your attitude somewhere else and don’t be a shame to others people who work with you. I never have any complications with All other people except Manager Pete.< /Text>

They provided excellent service and were helpful. Deliveries were on time and  as scheduled. Very competitive prices. Best on bark anywhere.We will be back again. Also great selections of rocks and decorative moss Rock.

UPDATE! May 21, 2018 Changed management. A bit curt & less courteous service. Prices for bark seem to be best, but  have increased . They will NOT deliver ROCK. Others will deliver. They claim afraid of liability for rock  delivery. I was impressed last year and made several purchases. NOT ANYMORE! NEW bark prices are off-the-wall!</review>

If you want the best landscaping products this is the place. Everything from bark to rocks and just about everything in between. Prices are decent and the employees are excellent. They also deliver with  multiple trucks and trailers. So give them a call or stop by. You won't be disappointed. ✌🇺🇸< /Text>

< Review>
Running a Landscape Company (A load off hauling and landcare)
We are constantly shopping around for the customer whether it's to buy Hardscape Rock Cedar- multi type bark ect. This yard has some of the  lowest prices around.
If you are a business they have price breaks on some materials.
There delivery fee is very reasonable and deliver even to sacramento area. The loaders have your trailer/truck in-and out in no time.

The best thing about them they have a (Sister yard no more than 200 feet from the office you can dump your GREEN waste for next to nothing. We usually bring in about 15 to 20 yards of GREEN debris and it cost us about $25 to dump....SOMETIMES LESS.... never over 25$  We stumbled upon this place while heading to the Roseville landfill to pay who knows what they wanted to charge us that day...... location is on Athens just passed the casino. Great place to check out they will help you with your measurements and giving you some ideas and advise on your projects...< /Review>

<review>We have bought rocks and soil from Rock Pro’s 3 times in the past 2 months and will continue to buy from them as our project continues thru June. Everyone we have interacted with have been professional, knowledgeable, helpful and personable. Virginia, Mike, Pete, Phil and Martin are the the individuals we have
delt  with.
We have always been given great competitive pricing.
Today we met Virginia & Mikes Mom & Dad, also wonderful with a lot of info on planting and soils.</review><date>1527911178612<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place had a relaxing atmosphere, chill people, and a hardworking bartender Friday night. Asked for the Fish and Chips for only $5.99 thinking it was going to be small but it was pretty big; definitely a plus. Found out the bartender was working by herself so she had to make drinks AND cook our food. Kinda ridiculous and felt bad about it. Had I known she was also making our food before I signed my tip I would have given her more. Cool place though - check it out.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Date>1536516427705<//Date><UserId.>112955082267898568252<//UserId.><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

My boyfriend planned a random romantic dinner for us here, and it was WONDERFUL! Excellent service, amazing food, and really any table there is great. The Pastor Pork Belly is unreal! Would love to come back.</Review>

<Text>Yesterday I went for the first time to Dublin's. I never felt like going before because some people had told me bad things about it. I wanted to give it a try though. The only thing I got was bad service. Both clerks were drunk, you could clearly smell it in their breath and in the way they were serving costumers. I wanted to go to the bathroom before ordering, and in my way there I was approached by a guy I honestly thought wanted to pick up a fight, but no.. I later learned he was one of the bartenders. He grabbed me by the arm and pushed me out of the bathroom hallway asking for my id. I understand that bars can get a big fine for not checking IDs, but that's not the way of handling the situation. I pulled out my ID while I was being dragged out of the bar, and told him that he was not practicing good customer service. He just smiled and laughed at everything I was saying. I realized he was drunk and there was no point in reasoning with him, so I took my friends and left. On the way out, people were asking why we were leaving and started complaining too. I'm not going back to this bar again.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I mean, it's no frills college dive bar with hit or miss service. Bottomless wings and fries are a great drunk food deal.<//review>

Yummy fettuccine alfredo and shrimp!! Italian sausage was okay and the pasta and sauce didn’t come on the side, which happens and we didn’t specify but it says it would on the menu. The fresh garlic and basil pizza was a no for me. Basil never gets baked and they baked. LA usually has bad pizza so I wasn’t too shocked but it’s an Italian place so 💁🏻‍♀️< /Review>

Great food! Atmosphere is decent - indoor and outdoor seating. They don't take reservations but I've never had to wait long. Get there before the rush. The dishes are hearty portions. Good bread and olive oil to start. Can't go wrong with this place.<//review>

When it comes to Italian food or just having a glass of red wine, Hank's Italian in Torrance is the place to come. Small little restaurant in town but excellent food and quick service. All around, this place should have a 10 star review. Thank you again for the excellent food and most of all let's not forget the cooks.

Awesome Italian food here in Torrance. All the food is hand made and excellent customer services here all around. Love to support local family business. Come on down and try this little place and I bet you that you will enjoy it like I did.

Everyone comes here for the Cioppino but my favorite dish of the night was the Crab Diavolo. I love Crab in general. The Crab Diavolo was buttery and spicy over the linguine. It was amazing. I would want to eat this dish every time I come to SF. It was that good. It was my favorite crab dish in San Francisco and that's saying a lot. San Francisco does seafood right.</text>

<text>The cioppino has a great depth of flavor you can really taste the seafood in the soup, and the seafood was very fresh and definitely large enough to share between two people, we were barely able to finish everything.<//text>< Pics>

Our favorite pizza and patio, my daughter loves coming here. We have been clients for a decade, the food is delicious and the owners are here working all the time. We order the Hawaiian pizza, salad and ice tea. Sometimes we get pasta with chicken and pink sauce. Note: my husband has been coming since he was a toddler too!< /Text>

Hank's has the best Italian food around. If you want delicious carbs, go here. You'll get plenty. Service is great too.<//Review>

So many Italian restaurants have gone total high-brow and pretentious. I love Hank's because it's kitschy Italian, like when I was growing up. And the staff is very friendly, and it's cozy inside -- although the patio's preferable, when weather permits. We always get the large veggie pizza, which has everything but the kitchen sink on it, and a pitcher of beer. It's a nice, pleasant meal, and none of the fuss.<//text>

This spot is my favored. I go to plenty of restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The team is very friendly and the cooking they serve is so fresh and tasty. I am always happy to have a decent meal in this place. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

Hank's Pizza makes incredible food! I was introduced to Hanks Pizza when I was a child. My dad went there, and we had a lot as I was growing up. As the years went by I kind of forgot about the place then later on as an adult I tried Hank's again and was amazed at how good it was still. Their Pizza is by far the best in the South Bay that I've had the sauce is sweet and Rich if so good! The only problem with Hanks Pizza is the fact that I can't stop eating it!<//review>

<time>1539399515675<//time><username>Judy Cocke</username><text>We always have the best time at Hank's Pizza! It's more than a pizza restaurant, they have beautiful entrees of pasta, seafood, wonderfully tasting garlic bread and of course a nice selection of wines. Their portions are generous, the staff is friendly, they greet you as family but maybe that is because it is a family owned restaurant, which we love. They take great pride in good service, and good food! We love Hank's!<//text></record>

<Review>If you visit So. Cal. Hank's Italian in Torrance is a must. Family owned and operated with great customer service, amazing food and reasonable prices for the amount of food and high quality ingredients...my family and I have enjoyed this establishment for over 20 years and it never ceases to amaze no matter what we order. From chicken picatta, lamb chops and pizza to the fine desserts. We drive over 1 hour to enjoy dinner at the covered patio with the fountain and nice Italian style music. I highly recommend Hank's, it's a family tradition.< /Review>< user_name>

Best Italian food in the area. The vegetarian pizza and vegetarian angel hair are two of the best in the world. The pizza toppings are very fresh, and the sauce is just right. I love the meatball soup. Nice quaint little bistro with good covered patio dining. The new fountain is beautiful.<//text>

This was our first visit. We met several people as we were going in, each of them stated thay we were going to enjoy the food. Tom said that he had been eating there for 35 years, and he travels from Huntington Beach.They were right, we really  enjoyed the food. The food tasted authentic and had a good presentation. The owners were very personable and the service was excellent . We will be returning and bringing friends.< /text>

When the manager can greet you and provide perfect service to you for a to-go order, despite the fact that the place is overflowing and totally crazy, it gets five stars from me. And the mushroom fettuccine is excellent!< /text>

Clean, quiet and friendly. Not for those that have a sensitive pallet. Herbs and spices are slightly heavy handed. My Grandfather couldn't eat his lasagna because of the over seasoning so they took it off the bill. That is great service and customer care in my book! And, for that I will be back!<//review>

<Review>Took my family of 4 here. Had 2 dinners (comes with salad and great parmesan bread) and 2 pasta meals. Tried the rigatoni w/meatnalls, ravioli, stuffed shells, and penne arrabiata. All were great. Had chocolate desert too, very good. Pleasantly surprised to find they had a military discount. Most of all, service was wonderful.

My new favorite spot for authentic clay pot rice dishes. Absolutely fantastic little gem in San Gabriel valley. Authentic Hong Kong style clay pot rice dishes and herbal steam soups. Ribs and preserved sausage, cured pork sausage with taro, and frog herb (Wei Kei) steam soup, all good eats.</Review>

First time ate here, referred by my friends. It's hard to find parking to have a meal here, their parking lot is so small so be ready for a longer walk and park somewhere further. Long waiting time if you come here during busy hours. The place is small, only few tables setting but their food are tasty, prices are pretty decent and customer service was great< /Review>

A strong contender for best claypot rice in town. They have lunch special clay pots that are smaller in portion (but still cooked with lots of love) compared to their dinner counter parts. Their sauce is a weird oyster sauce blend, unfortunately, instead of being a sugar+soy sauce+white pepper mix.< /review>

<Name>Chris Yu<//Name><review>Not a bad spot for clay rice pot. I've driven by this restaurant for so many years without realizing what they served here. I came to know the name thanks to the sisters from HangryDiary when they mentioned this restaurant is their favorite for rice pot. Hailing from Hong Kong, I love all types of clay rice pots, especially the crispy rice on the bottom. So going into Nature Pagoda, I had high expectations as to their taste.

I came here alone on a Monday afternoon and it was very quiet. There were only 2 other tables occupied by groups but the workers had a lot of time on their hands. I ordered their lunch portion preserved meat rice pot, which also came with a small soup. I don't know the exact name but it tasted a lot like chicken soup with winter melon but I could be wrong. Once the pot came out, I waited a couple minutes before digging in because I wanted the rice at the bottom to get even crisipier so that I can struggle and dig for it at the end of the meal.

Overall taste was just okay; the soy sauce they provided was more on the salty side and not sweet enough. Soy sauce for this dish needs to be dark and sweet in order to fully enjoy it. The amount of meat was less than abundant but then again, it was a lunch portion. The part I was longing for was a disappointment though. Not enough crispy rice at the end but there still was some so enjoy at least, which is why I gave this place a four. I honestly believe I would come back and try other dishes in the future but I'll just stick to a different restaurant for my clay rice pots because I get a lot more crispy rice.<//review><user>101150753919069824692< /user>< GmapID>

<Review>This place was my late night hanging out place when I was in college almost 20 years ago. The Cantonese sausage rice pot and sweet steam egg dessert warmed my tummy for the the night. Their herb tea tasted good but not overly sweet.
Location was small with limited seating. Parking lot was small too.< /Review><date>1579414127246</date><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2dab6f79d9a5d:0x416976770c419741< /gmap_id>< Rating>

First time here, a bit disappointed with the hot clay pot rice, rice not fully cooked and no crispy burnt rice at the bottom. Didn’t use soy sauce, instead used a very starchy oyster-liked sauce. Expected chicken thigh or leg instead of white meat, too starchy and very little meat.< /Review>

<Review>This is the place I go for the clay hot pot for the rice, and I sometimes drinks soups and herbal tea here because it is traditional (I mean it is not very sweet for herbal tea). The service here is good but sometimes need to wait for the seat because the place is small. Therefore, overall I recommended their Hog's Stomach with Ginkgo Nuts and Ribs with Preserved Sausage because it is very good in my opinion. I definitely come back here more often especially for lunch time because it has very good prices for the clay pot rice.<//Review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) The food was good, but the clerk didn't dare to compliment him. He called to make an appointment to pick it up. But when I arrived, she said she didn't understand what I described. (It’s okay if you don’t hear the words clearly, super impatient). Hang up the phone without saying a few words, and then keep pulling English. It can only remind the friends to be careful about the waiter's face.

(Original)
吃的不错，店员态度不敢恭维，打电话订餐约好时间来取，到了却说我描述的她没听清？（没听清好好说话也行，超级不耐烦的那种）打电话没说几句直接挂断电话，再打一直拽英文，只能提醒小伙伴们小心服务员甩脸色了<//text>

(Translated by Google) The autumn fish rice is good. The water fish soup is good. It’s a long-established restaurant. Speak Mandarin and speak slowly. The waiter always speaks Cantonese like this.

<text>(Translated by Google) A friend introduced it. The taste of the clams is small. The taste is very general. The waiter sees that you are a northerner who basically ignores you. At the time of checkout, the tip is not much to ask you to make up! I have never seen such a cow shop! Desserts are not very good. I don't know how to get the four and a half stars? Those who pay for it!

(Original)
朋友介绍而来 煲仔饭菜少 味道很一般 服务员看你是北方人基本对你爱答不理。结账时小费给的不多还叫你补！我是没见过这么牛的店！甜品更是不怎么样。不知道怎拿到的四星半？花钱请的人吧！<//text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Today around 8:10 PM my friend and I bought two cups of drink for around $5. But we gave the cashier $20, and she only returned us $4 change. So we were telling the cashier we gave her $20 but she said she only receives $10. We wanted to check the camera, but the cashier refuses to,so we lost $10 to nowhere. I advise everyone to be careful when you eat/ drink here.
It should be around eight o'clock tonight, and my friend and I came to this store to buy two cups of herbal tea, which totaled more than five yuan. We gave a 20 yuan to the cashier but she only gave us more than 4 yuan. I told her that we had given her a sheet of 20 yuan but she denied it, so we wanted to watch the video recorder and she would not let us watch it, so we suggest that if you come here to consume in the future, please pay more attention when paying.

今天晚上大該 八點多我和朋友一起來這家店買兩杯涼茶ㄧ共五塊多。我們拿一張20 塊給收銀員但是她只找給我們4塊多。我告訴她 我們已給她一張二十元但她否認，所以我們想看錄影機 她也不要讓我們看，所以我們建議大家以後如果有來這裡消費， 付錢時請多注意。< /text>

<review>The gas prices always become the lowest in town.
The gas quality is much better than
AM/PM and they do not charge for debit card usage.

My opinions based on experience and observations.

Remember only IDIOTS
TAILGATE
TEXT OR TALK ON PHONE
DO NOT ALWAYS USE SIGNALS
DRINK/USE DRUGS

WHEN DRIVING

Don't be an Idiot.
It might be your family that you kill next time.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The cashiers are nice and everything, but I come here because my car (a 29 year old honda) gets 3-5 more miles per gallon when I gas up here than anywhere else in town. That simple.</Text>

Stella was the best! I had a unit here for over 10 years. I moved out of state, forgetting my unit entirely. When it came time to move out, I wasn’t able to get everything out of my unit in time. So Stella took it upon herself to make sure the unit met all requirements for move out just so I wouldn’t be charged. She went above and beyond. She made a difficult situation easy. Now, the next time I need a storage unit, I’m heading to the nearest Public Storage, hoping to find another property manager like Stella. Thank you!<//Text>

We LOVE Public Storage! We use them for various reasons but this time we needed to store our car for a couple of months in a safe, clean place & Public Storage always meet our needs! Everything is fast, easy, organized & a great price too! The girl that checked me in was so clear & thorough with all the details (I forgot her name) & checking out with Eric took just minutes! I can't wear a mask so he was so kind to come outside to bring me my move-out receipt! Fast, easy, friendly & professional! They both did a great job & we appreciate it! Thank you so much Public Storage!!!< /text>

Etella the property manager was fantastic. I was out of town  and she was able to help with questions and issues I had regarding my storage unit. She made everything easy and was always accessible when I called. I also dealt with Lorraine who helped me coordinate a lock replacement and she couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful. Both of them are great representatives of why you would want to use Public Storage for your storage needs.< /text>

This is my first time renting out a storage space. Estella is super kind and made the process really easy! She was very patient with me to make sure I understood everything. Today I leave a happy customer! :)</Review>

This was my first time visiting a Public Storage property. I had a wonderful experience. Estella was very kind and helpful. From the customer service to the pretty simple and straight forward process of acquiring a storage unit, I was very pleased. I highly recommend this location.<//Text>

I love this place! Best customer service ever ! Andy was amazing! I needed a storage space yesterday , went online talked to an actual human being who hooked me up with exactly what I needed fast efficiently ! The unit I needed was $ 160 / month , no problem but they gave me first month for $1, cant beat that , instant move in! Today upon arrival i had a problem the unit I rented was too small , went to office talked to Andy he instantly showed me what was available as an upgrade , I chose a unit after he personally showed me each unit! Instantly pro rated the new rate and I was in the bigger unit with in 5 minutes !!!!!!! Talk about AMAZING customer service this place Rocks ! Andy , thank you so much , for making my storage experience  smooth , fast , and efficient, I highly recommend this place!< /text>

This place has been great to me with whatever I need. Emmanuel has been instrumental in everything I have needed thus far. You can tell he actually cares about the people renting. I can’t say I have had a pleasurable experience like this at any other public storage I’ve been to.</review>

This particular Public Storage and it's manager Estella, were terrific.  I was there 4 months. Estella always had a smile on her face and a friendly hello.  She seems very motivated, is always walking the property, sometimes with a mop and bucket, always cheerful and offering assistance.
I would highly recommend storing here VS the one at 2065 Placentia - where my reservation/unit was cancelled and given away to a prior walkin despite my arriving at the committed day/time to unload my belongings.  That manager was rude and unhelpful, as was the District Manager Lorraine, who seemed helpful and asked me to submit to her documentation of what had occurred at 2065 Placentia - but never followed up with me! A total lack of respect for me and the time I spent providing her detailed documentation/emails.
Only one negative about this facility.  The crickets were huge and MANY in my 10x12 unit. That was a turnoff - and now that my things are out, I hope I don't find those crickets in my belongings.
Back to Estella - who helped to change my opinion of PS.  I would def recommend 1725 Pomona - thanks to Estella's positive way/service.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>When leasing a storage unit you have just a minimum idea of what you want and the cost of one unit that you need. My experience was a amazing at this location, by far the best storage facility I’ve been to . Maria was very knowledgeable and not pushy. She proved that customer service that is key and that is needed in every business. She guided me to a storage unit that met my needs and without  no hesitation. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone that needs extra space.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

Stella does an incredible job keeping the property in tip top shape. She is more than helpful and always has a smile on her face. Stellas hard work is what sets this location apart from the rest!<//text>

Ms.Barbara! 😊😊
The sweetest . Very patient . Very helpful. The most welcoming . She made me feel like family. This was my first time renting a storage unit and it was super easy with her. I even forgot my I.D and was juggling my 3 kiddos and she totally made it feel like a breeze . Thank You... even though I WAS sweating haha ...I felt like I didn't even have to break a sweat signing up and every thing.  We love our unit ..♡<//Text>

My roommate and I came to this location the other day as we need to find a place to store some of the extra stuff we have now that we have moved in together. This location was very convenient to our apartment and was also very clean and well maintained. We were greeted by Barbara who was super nice and knew exactly what we needed to be able to store some of the books and furniture we had. She had great customer service and bought some boxes to pack the stuff up in. She was right, it was exactly the right amount of boxes that we needed. Barbara knows her stuff and we're definitely coming back here.< /Review>

NEW MANAGER HAS NO CLUE !!!  Stella is completely clueless and has no idea how to manage.   she made a mistake locking up my storage unit when i WASNT delinquent.   this didn't allow me to move out and now since she won't admit to her mistake public storage wants me to pay all these fees that shouldn't be there because i would have been all moved out if it wasn't for STELLAS error.

there's plenty of other storage units<//Text>

I've utilized Public Storage in several different locations and have always had an overall good experience.  I recently moved to and I'm currently storing my valuables at the Public Storage in Costa Mesa and I'm MORE than satisfied.  Barbara has been friendly and helpful throughout my whole transition and is right in too of any questions or concerns I might have.  She has been very attentive to my needs and has made this storing experience an exceptional one.  I highly recommend entrusting your storables with Public Storage.  Thanks Barbara!< /Text>

Barbara is very friendly and got me a spot right by the front for easy access. Barbara took the time to explain policies very clearly to me so I don't inadvertently end up with extra charges. This location is very clean and professional looking. I've been to plenty of storage places that were seedy to put it mildly but this one is definitely top-notch.< /Review>

This place is great! Reasonable pricing with frequent promotions.

I had a car parked here for a few months, and when I came back, the battery had died, but Barbara and her associate saved the day by locating a set of jumper cables so I could start my car!

If you need storage or long-term parking with a convenient location near the heart of Costa Mesa just off the 55, let Barbara and the rest of her friendly and helpful staff help you out!<//Review>

We've been with this public storage now for 5 years and I must say they're very good. Barber the front office person always has an answer for me and always seems to have a way to solve a problem. A very kind and respectful person. She makes a whole world of difference,  pretty sure that's the reason why we're still here.</review>

I had a wonderful experience at this property. The property manager Barbara greeted me with a smile and showed me the perfect size unit that I would be needing. She went over the process step by step and walked me through all of the paperwork. Also suggested some important things I should have like boxes so I can keep all of my things organized, a lock, and some packing peanuts.I'm so thankful for her making my experience a good one.<//Text>

This facility is clean, in a great location and the prices are very fair.  Barbara, the facility manager, rented me two units and made the whole process pain-free.  I highly recommend using their facility for any of your storage needs.

Thanks Barbara!!</Review>

STAY AWAY -- there's plenty of other places.   the management is horrible.   stella has no idea what she's doing.   they will hike prices on u after u move in, try to tack insurance on ur account and after one day delinq they will start a lien sale paperwork .    don't bother<//text>

<text>Barbara made the whole process a breeze. She listened to my needs and we found a storage unit size that worked for me. She was very informative - not to mention,  the most genuinely kind and pleasant person I have come across in a long while! If if weren't for her, the experience of getting a storage facility would be a dull hassle. Thanks, Barbara!<//text>< pictures>

<text>Joseph is the manager at the Public Storage location on Pomona Avenue and you couldn't ask for a harder working or more efficient manager. He does it all!

Barbara and Todd were very helpful today. I needed to get into my storage immediately but had broken my only key to my storage lock and could not get in.  Went and talked with Barbara at the front and she told me what I needed to do. She said the only way I could get in is if I had the lock cut off by the manager Todd. She called Todd and he came out the same day to cut it.  I'm extremely happy with my experience and with how quickly they helped me solve the problem. I definitely will be continuing to rent from them and referring them to everyone I know.< /Text>

Barbara who manages this site, is now a friend since providing excellent communication, medical care post a serious car accident prior to a Hoag ER VISIT, had to pay my bill. She was so worried an insisted ER was more important. She has maintained decorum 100% of the time with all clients which is truly exceptional and unlike any other public storage who are all good. I find her flawless. Other units have had overspray, or some sort of theft, troubles, and she runs a smooth ship. I wish upper management would feature her for woman of Orange County. I arrive post electrical fire, where neither Irvine nor Edison took responsibility. Like any big corporation, medical, or other, she is what makes Orange County the reason we grew up here and love it. She is always  looking after others. In addition I was concerned one day about an issue. She took charge and was very calm, in a situation where two other men could not figure out how to get the moving done. I think she attracts quality tenants this way. I would give her 20 stars ******************** : ) Christine Anne, To Corporate, She should be a trainer with her people skill to all of you she is a Gem.........</Text>

<text>I rented a unit from this PS. I have never needed storage before so I read several reviews on several different storage facilities and the best money and best reviews was for this PS. I worked with Barbara who was so friendly and a joy to work with. She showed me the unit which was clean and walked me through all the procedures (opening the gate, locking my unit). She rocked and sign up, while there was a several things to sign, was a breeze. Thank you PS and Barbara!< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dd20769b7d9bef:0xebb03227807e103f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was downsizing and went to public storage to put some things away. The staff there were incredibly helpful and met my needs exactly. Laura helped me specifically, and not only was she incredibly accomdating and knowledgeable but also friendly and unbelievely sweet and professional. Public storage is affordable and very clean. I would recommend this PS to anyone.<//text>

<username>Rc Kucera< /username><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>A friend was in a bad situation & asked for help with a storage unit rental. Went online & used their express check-in and the property manager, Barbara, called me within 10 minutes, introducing herself, advising me of office times, informed me of supplies available etc... We showed up as she was completing her last transaction, I was ready to sign & "just wanted get it over with" but she wanted me to see the unit first to make sure it was what I needed. When she opened the conveniently located unit it was clean, plenty big enough & had a solid metal floor to keep contents from getting wet when it rained. The unit was perfect, we completed paperwork in a very timely manner & she made the code very easy to remember even for my little pea brain! Transaction was fast, easy & Barbara was awesome! I would definitely use this place again & have no problem recommending this location to anyone!<//Text><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

Quick and easy and Barbara, who helped me was just awesome!!   We had quite a bit in common after chatting with her.    She made a great suggestion about a plastic cover for the flooring with the upcoming possibility of a wet, rainy El Niño season upcoming.  Thanks for that Barbara!< /review>

I rented a unit here on 12/18/2013 and had efficient, helpful and friendly service. Barbara Donohoe answered all of my questions and took care of what I needed immediately. I hadn't called for any information prior to walking in, and still I was in and out in 30 minutes with exactly what I needed at a lower cost than I was expecting. The unit and facility itself are great - convenient, well-lit, insured, and very reasonably priced.< /text>

We just moved into a unit on Pomona. Joseph was friendly, organized, professional, and helpful; he even called me the day after I reserved online. It's our 2nd time  - the 1st after our house burned to the ground. We had a  unit for the few things we salvaged and later a parking spot for our little boat. This time we're downsizing with grown kids. It's often a time of change when you store belongings. Our family highly recommends Public Storage as clean, safe always friendly and reasonably priced.</review>

They also called after my move in to see how I was doing and if they could help in any way

How often does any company call you after you have paid and see how you are!
They are both always smiling and say Hello who knew how fun it is to have a storage unit with those great employees they are more like friends
If anyone needs a storage unit this is the place!
Thank you Barbra and Iliana

<review>This storage facility is outstanding in every way: safe, clean, well lit, convenietly located, has a mix of every size imaginable, with easy access and super parking right adjacent to all the units.

What distinguishes this place the most is the on-site staff of Iliana and Barbara. Both have been with Public Storage.for many years, Barbara for decades, and are extremely knowledgeable, professional and helpful. Barbara lives on-site so there is that additional security.

Iliana is especially friendly and desirous of pleasing all of her customers and will go out of her way to do so. If only everyone had such a caring attitude the world would be a better place. I've rented here for some years now (how time does fly), and could not have made a better selection. Thank you Ilians and Barbara.<//review></record>

<time>1465747811183</time><review>Have you met Barbara at the public storage on Pomona in Costa mesa? What a great experience! (if there is such a thing while renting a storage) I only say this because the people at p.s. Especially barb assured me it was normal to go through anxiety and stress dramatization and that all the bad decisions i had made would ultimately be okay! I love the gang at p.s. and even though my shortcomings will leave my life in ruins , I feel like I've gained a family of friends at public storage on pomona st. In costa misery.

(Translated by Google) I had my things here for about 3 months due to Cov19 situations, I couldn't pay and when I went to pick up my things my padlock was broken. Now that I am checking my belongings, my notebook is not there, they are thieves!

<Review>The hike here is short and really nice. It goes through a cypress grove that provides some shelter. At one end of the trail there are tide pools, and at the other end of the platform there’s a beach with some seals. A really nice little hike.< /Review><gmapID>0x808034b5a68d5637:0xe8ecd006b60214f0<//gmapID><user_id>107300743487653800360<//user_id>< date>

<review>Beautiful get-a-way spot! Love the boardwalks thru the coastal brush. Love to watch the squirrels(?) antics for entertainment. Beautiful rocky northern coastline. Spotted some whales off in the distance. Great coastal experience. We visit here every time thru Fort Bragg and never disappointed</review>< Time>

< Review>
Lane was our tour guide and was absolutely hilarious! She definitely kept the momentum of the entire experience going and had tons of celebrity scoop that an avid celeb gossiper didn't know before. Thank you Florence and lane for a great experience during a quick weekend in LA! Can always count on Florence for quality :) #lovevanderpump<//Review>

<Review>The Station still looks the same. Platform is too skinny which can be even worse during rush hour when it gets overcrowded your forced to walk on the edge of the platform which is kinda of dangerous when oncoming trains enter and leave the platform. The blue line renovation work should have focused on making the platform more wider to have more space to walk safely. I’m disappointed they didn’t focus on making this station wider<//Review>< pictures>

Great experience at this place. My son came in looking for a bike. He knew exactly what he wanted. Let him rest drive it and then helped him take the wheels off to fit in the car. The guys were amazing, super friendly, made small talk with my son l. The store itself is super clean with some nice shirts, jackets and shoes that I haven't seen at other vans stores. You would definitely have to go in and take a look. The clothes looked like great quality and very different from what I've seen. I will definitely be returning to get my husband/son some clothes from this place.<//Text>

James is great! Very helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, good stock, always cuts a good deal. Just found this shop, very handy. I'm pretty sure I'm the only 40 year old woman regularly in his shop who is not shopping for their 13 year old son, he's cool though, he gets me :p</text>

He is the most kindest person I have ever seen if I ever needed help on my bike for a part he would do it,
And he is funny and if you ask about cult riders like Anthony panza I thought he was switching to Merritt because I thought that was a bike company he said no every rider has a parts brand like cinema is a parts brand not a bike brand. So over all my experience he has been helpful, and wonderful< /Review>

<Review>James really helped me out (a non bmx’er). We are cycling across the USA and I had a puncture. 2 inner tubes later I am starting to panic. Phoned James he said to come over. He was patient and talked us through what we were doing wrong plus fixing the puncture.

<Review>Called James, and let him know I was coming with my son to choose a new bike. Instantly my son migrated towards a blue cult bicycle. I couldn't help but notice how clean and organized his store was. From shoes and socks to T shirts, cranks and pedals to grips and frames. Real kid friendly and had just enough stock to make his store look outstanding. We bought the bike at a great deal. We will be back. Thank you for your time and effort. We appreciate you!!< /Review>< pictures>

Very knowledgeable,  and has all the newest best products out there,  and the price point is great makes shopping for bike parts online useless when you can basically go get the parts you need right away any day of the week and will help install,  I don't let any one touch my bike except for james at kings</text>

<Review>I feel like I am back in the Yucatán.  Well, that's the closest I've been to Guatemala anyway. The food is very similar although of course a little different.  The lovely Guatemalan lady who served my food sat down with me for a while and we talked in spanish about her country and my experience of living in Mérida. She has been to my Yucateco city many times. Oh, the food? Fantastic.    ¡Muy muy rico!< /Review>< rating>

Great hole in the wall food! We went before the waitress came, so we had to speak Spanish. The waitress was fluent in English though when she came in.</Text>

Ordered a daybed online and very satisfied. The price was so competitive that I was skeptical at first. I called the store and the rep was very nice and helped me check if it was in stock. Then I proceeded with ordering on their website and it was very easy. The daybed arrived in a few days and the delivery guys even brought it up to our second floor patio. Very happy!

Aetna Furniture store is the best place to buy furniture. Alejandro and Artem set up the furniture and did a wonderful job at it. The furniture is set up beautifully in your home and it’s very good quality.<//text>

< Review>
Bought a dining room and sectional, not great quality. We have 15 days and the items look like we had them for about a year now. The table can scratch and the paint is bad. I contacted them and they just gave me a credit for the table, the paint on the dining table is very bad. One of the chair has a rip on the cushion. The sectional the long part moves and is longer than the leg and the cushion is cheap. When delivered they didn't even tighten the chairs and still has plastic under.<//Review>

This place has great deals on furniture. They sell all of the big name brand that the big stores have, but at a much better price.  Parking is a little tricky. It's a small entrance around the corner from the front. If you blink,  you may miss it</text>

Wow, prices are amazing! Large showroom many different options for those on a budget. When I went I was looking at sectionals and couches for a new apartment. While checking the furniture out a male worker came over and started showing me how different sectionals converted into sleepers. He was very helpful and I appreciated his willingness to show me the functionality of different pieces I was interested in purchasing. He was a lot more knowledgeable than the female European sales person sitting at a desk. The female didn't even know that the store sold adjustable bed frames when I inquired about the beds. I had to correct her and inform her that the store sold more than mattresses. If you go, I'd see if the middle aged Spanish man is available. He can help you with the functions available with the furniture and won't make you feel stupid for asking questions. I'd recommend that you check it out yourself and get blown away with the prices. Happy furniture hunting...</Review>

<text>This trip to LA was absolutely absurd.  I made sure to call and inquire about the items that we wanted to purchase. I asked several times if they were in stock. I was told yes they were and we could purchase at the store and pick them up as well. Well, my husband and I drove 50 miles to LA for NOTHING. We were told by the saleswoman that such items needed to be ordered online and the items would be delivered.  Such a disappointment.< /text>< user_name>

Recently purchased a 6 pc dining set from them. Delivery date was earlier than expected; Delivery time was also spot on. Thanks to Alex and Dinar for being kind enough to drop the furniture inside despite the large number of stairs. Would definitely consider buying from them again.<//Review>

This was easiest furniture shopping of my life. Chose it in a store in less than 2 weeks I got it delivered by 2 nicest guys Alex and Dinar! Boys did an amazing job assembling it together. Very professional, sweet and polite! Great job! Definitely will shop more with Aethna!!!< /review>

This is my second time here and I highly recommend it. They are very professional and so helpful. They don't try to oversell you which I found a lot of places do. One stop shop for your mattress and headboard. Don't go anywhere else! :)</review>

< Review>
Ordered a bed and nightstands. Delivery was a nightmare but with COVID I understood. What they don’t tell you is if you don’t pay for assembly they will send you a broken bed and you’ll need to go to Home Depot to fix it yourself because they will hang up the phone and not answer any emails. Never had a worse experience anywhere. It wasn’t something I could work around because I couldn’t place the boards on without this wood that looked ripped off.< /Review>

<Text>Super happy with the mattress we got here: high quality mattress delivered on-time. Most importantly they helped us narrow down the choices based on our preferences. It wasn't a push towards a more expensive mattress; it was genuine assistance.Not sure if we'll need another mattress any time soon but we'll definitely visit this location when that happens.< /Text>< Pictures>

Finally went to the new Burbank store location... it was much easier to get to the store parking than the last one.   We came early in the morning so we found a parking spot right when you enter, but it looks like there's another parking lot on the other side of the front entrance.< /Review>

My salesman was Marcus. He was very knowledgeable and patient. I finally zeroed in on a model and it was delivered this week. I had to do nothing but open the door for the guys who delivered it. They did all the work, they took away the old setup and assembled the entire new frame/boxspring/mattress even the bedskirt. They took away all of the wrappings etc. I am very happy with this purchase and Aetna Stores and would not hesitate to recommend them.< /Text>

I bought a dresser online that arrived already built and the drawers were not closing at the same depth.
They were not lining up- making the dresser look weird.

They ended up sending someone to fix it and resolve the issue. They took responsibility and made sure I could enjoy my dresser. Very much appreciated!<//review>

First time shop here.  Was wary about the price: too-good-to-be-true?  But they came thru great with my Ashley reclining sofa.  So happy with the services, got the 8% discount with cash.  Definitely will consider them again for future furniture purchases.  Thank you Aetna!</text>

<review>I guess I should have read the reviews before buying anything from Aetna. Was delivered a dinning set. Delivery guys had a problem with the chairs they called it in as defective on Thursday here we are Monday with no communication or email as the delivery said someone will call you back. What horrible customer service after paying 1k< /review>< pictures>

I have been calling this place and sent an email and still no response.. All I needed is assistance with an online order and there is no one answering calls or returning emails. I was interested in a few items and would like the 8% cash discount. How is this going to work if your showroom is closed? Also, the way it reads is I will have to pay online and then come in the store and pay cash (a second payment) and then the first will be refunded? That means I would have to “temporarily” spend close to 4 grand just to get the 8% discount? (Close to 2000 order) ... That isn’t going to work. I can come in and pay in cash and your team can place the order at that time, or apply a promo code for the 8% off that way I don’t have to double pay for a purchase.... so far this is extremely frustrating. The fact that as a customer I am unable to reach anyone with the company is ridiculous.<//text>

Finding the right pillows changed my life.  Not kidding.  These pillows worked magic on my neck.  Non-toxic is a huge plus.

I'm coming back for a bed next.  The guy here was very patient and he had an uncanny knack for picking out the exact products that would work or me based on my description of my issues and what I like.</text>

Horrible.! If you are looking to buy furniture here, while it is a very good descent price, it is not worth the headache.! I've tried ordering 5 different items, 2 being a couch set, 2 ottomans and 1 dining set. The only emails I got were apologies that they are out of the product or that it is discontinued.... discontinued.?? Why is it still up on your website then.!?!?! It is not hard to contact manufactures to see what is their inventory looking like to update on your website. No, instead they have me purchase it, wait 3 days, finally email you saying they apologies but here is some "similar items". I didnt ask for similar items.! I asked for that one that your website that said you had it stock so I added to my cart and purchased..... I can honestly tell you first hand, dont purchase from here.! I myself have a lot of patience.! I work with people everyday.! This cuts the cake though... I applaud you Aetna for crushing my dreams of furnishing my new place with the furniture I wanted.! Please feel free to take a bow.!< /text>

Husband made a purchase for sectional here online. Day after received a notice they will check stock and get back to me. First of, what do you mean check stock. Why are you selling if you dont have. Waited 1 day no response. Have been emailing. Texting and calling no response. I want to know if my selection is in stock if not We demand a refund.< /Text>

<Review>I can't recommend Aetna Stores enough!  I've use them for years and recommend them weekly. Their quality of work is superb!  The owner Edmond is an Awesome guy. He's friendly, accommodating and professional.  They really know their stuff!  Not only with their upholstery but with their restoring and refinishing.  AAA+ in my book.< /Review>< Date>

<review>I cannot day enough good things about Aetna furniture. From beginning to end, the experience is incredible. Their customer service team is very professional. They provide updates whenever you call. Their contracted moving company makes the experience in valuable ! I HIGHLY recommend paying extra for assembly, they are quick, efficient and very thorough. I had Vlad and Yura help me with my assembly and these guys are like a factory: they quickly brought all items up, were very careful not to bump or cause damage, and even helped clean up everything afterwards and take all boxes down. They even helped me configure my room until it was perfect and to my liking! So professional, they made a stressful move very very easy. HIGHLY recommend !</review><username>amreep dhillon< /username>< pictures>

Den and Eugen were very polite and professional! The store said it would take 5-10 days for delivery and my furniture came in 6 days. The time I was given was from 8am-12pm and they were here by 8:45am! I had 3 items delivered and assembled in a little over 2 hours. Den and Eugen were very efficient and did not waste any time!

I ordered a bed in this store, a night stand and a dresser from the manufacturer Ashley.  The quality is terrible, the boxes at the dresser and the night stand do not close until the end.  The bed was brought with spare parts from another bed and I waited 3 weeks for a replacement.  When other parts were brought in, during the assembly process it turned out that the slats on which the mattress lies more than the bed frame .... I called and said that I did not need such a bed and I could not sleep on the floor for 2 months and wait, so I want to  return the bed and the whole set.  They answered my request for a refund that they could not accept it back because it was collected.  Now I am paying a loan for this garbage, which is in the hallway.  I do not recommend buying furniture from this company, because they do not sell high-quality goods, which you will not be able to return later.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We just ordered a new dining table to replace our old broken one.
We paid for assembly as well. Vlad and his team member came and were very professional and efficient in assembling. They also kept the space very clean and kept all the packaging pieces and trash were contained, and they kept all the pieces in the box and Vlad advised us to keep for one month in case there are any issues. That was extremely helpful. Vlad also figured out the problem with our old table leg and helped to fix that as well. Thank you Vlad and Aetna Furniture for such great service.<//Text>< pictures>

My husband and I had the BEST experience here. Everything was customizable and able to be made exactly to our taste. The delivery fee was nominal and our very own custom couch was at our door in a week. 10/10 recommend!< /Text>

Had a great experience with this store. The service was excellent and great selection of items that this store provide for whatever you may be looking for. The delivery with Vlad and Yura were both professional and fast in their work. They took the time necessary to make sure everything was completely well done! I definitely recommend. Thanks Aetna.< /Review>

At first I was a little bit skeptic to order from unfamiliar store. But the drawer came assembly, delivery team was quick and really professional. Seems I will be a customer of this store. Also customer service is 5 out of the 5.

If I could give Aetna 6 stars I would. I ordered a large bathroom suite and as it was readied for delivery I had to travel to the east coast for a family emergency. EVERYONE I dealt with at Aetna was incredibly kind and thoughtful. When I finally made it home, the team that came out for the delivery was amazing. Huge heavy pieces, navigated through a maze of narrow doors, each piece put exactly in place, all hardware attached and every shred of packing material vanished. Thank you Aetna. And customers -  if you happen to be shopping for bath vanities and such, be sure to check out their Design Element collection. I looked everywhere and nothing came close to matching the style, quality and value. The stuff is gorgeous. Thank you Aetna. I'll be back.< /Review>

<Review>if you want to buy furniture online , go somewhere else ! it will be much faster and easier.
-ETA from manufacturers are not up to date.
-credit card payment without secured system so if you want to buy more than 3000 dollards you have to pay by check or cash, not very convenient when you buy online.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

This place has a huge variety of furniture in a lot of different design styles. The staff is not at all pushy and will leave you alone while you browse, but they're also very happy to answer any questions you have. The furniture isn't cheap, but it's reasonably priced for the quality. I didn't happen to find what I was looking for when I visited, but I'll definitely be back next time I'm looking for furniture.<//Text>

Nick and Ted were great! Excellent communication on getting scheduled and super easy to work with. They were professional and courteous. Best of all, they cleaned up (including vacuuming)!! They were in and out in an hour and a half and I was left with a completely put together bunkbed, no mess, and 2 happy kids! The extra cost for the white glove installation was 100% worth it. I got to spend time with the family while they worked hard to assemble and clean up. They even took the trash with them. I will definitely come back!!<//text>

Ordering on line was easy.  The price was very good.  Customer service kept me up to date when delivery was near.  They arrived within the time window given.  I paid for the "white glove" delivery, which includes assembly.  It took 2 men 3.5 hours to assemble the bunk bed I ordered.  The assembly was well worth the price.  The assembly was well done.  The bunk bed was of very good quality.  They removed all trash when done.  The entire experience could not have been any better.<//Text>

Everything was great! The delivery was smooth. Everything arrive with 10 business days. Prices were beyond reasonable. Customer service with Irene was easy an flawless. We love the items. Easy to assemble and our living room looks great now!

Especially the coffee and end tables we ordered. They're great.

Thank you Irene (and everyone else at Aetna) for all your help!

I'll be telling everyone about Aetna Furniture!< /Review>

DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!! I wouldn’t give them any stars if possible. I have never had such poor service. This company is beyond unprofessional. My fiancé ordered $8000 worth of furniture in the first week of December which they said we would get in 2weeks. It didn’t come til middle of January with all wrong equipment and furniture. It is February and we have gotten nothing but excuses on why they haven’t brought my mattress and my bed pieces. It has been such an awful experience and so stressful because they have came twice with wrong equipment. My mother has only her box springs and She has chronic back pain, which she takes strong medication for. Now they are saying we must speak with claims because they have to approve for us to get pieces we already paid for, but they have failed to bring right pieces why are we going threw claims. Very unhappy with money spent with them.

It’s funny that you try to make it seem as if you are doing all you can to fix the problem, but instead of giving us our money back for the mattress you never brought and then sent a email with demands in order to get our money back ( we would have to take down our review in order to get our money). Such bad business. Also, we have told you we are still pieces. We have only received partial parts and even if we had the parts, we are left to figure out how to put it together because we paid to have you guys put it together. I doubt you will be in business long if you continue on your business like this.</text>

I am blown away! Aetna Furniture must be Los Angeles best kept secret. I never had such a wonderful experience. I love the furniture and the customer service was amazing Paul was awesome at keeping me updated. Let's not forget ANDREY and the rest of the crew who delivered for us you were very patient and went above and beyond for us. You set up everything just the way we wanted. I furnished my whole apartment and I'm very happy I found this place. Friendly service, quick delivery and all around the best. I will be ordering from you all again. Once again shout out to ANDREY for the awesome experience.<//Text>

They were both very professional, positive, and honest about doing their job. I had 2 items with upgraded white glove service for them to assemble a king size bed and a computer desk. They were very quick about doing the assembly for them.
I would definitely recommend to others for Ilia and Levon and I would love to get their assistance again next time.</Review>< Rating>

I purchased a bunk bed from the company that arrived in good standing.  The contractors took 3 hours to assemble the beds and damaged/left out necessary screws. Instead of the contractors informing me about the damaged/missing items, they attempted to leave my home. However, I noticed the damages/missing items and reported them to the contractors and aetna. The contractors took pictures, told me that they will report the damages to aetna, and reassured me not to worry since the items will be replaced. However, the contractors never reported the damages. I've had a difficult time communicating with someone by phone regarding my claims and the claims department will not respond to my emails. Also, the claims department can only be reached by email and contacted me about my claims after 9:00 pm. The store refuse to replace the damaged items, per their policy and/or provide me with a full refund after their contractors damaged the bunk bed. I am not satisfied with purchasing a new bunk bed that is damaged and unsafe due to missing/damaged parts. I am also disappointed with the store not adhering to their policies and not resolving my complaint.<//review><Rate>1</Rate>< UserId.>

My new bed was delivered as promised by a very polite young man who assembled it without any issues. He then unpacked my new mattress and box spring and put them on the bed for us (even though we had purchased those elsewhere).  He even took all the packing materials from the mattress and box spring out to our recycling bin. Very good service!  Well worth the nominal fee we paid for setup.< /Text>

This is not even a store they are like an eBay for furniture And beside some that I went and placed my order at the store after placing my order online and having it pending for 2 weeks I go to the store and purchase the bed frames the man says 7-20 business days for delivery 5-7 for pick up and two weeks later I’ve had it and contacted them asking for it and they tell me it should be here Monday and an hour later they say it was never in stock to begin with yet I was charged cash and was given a receipt and then he tells me I need to wait for an appointment to see if the store has cash honestly worst experience HELEN sound like a computer copying and pasting the same thing every time you ask her something she says the same thing< /review>

Ilia and Levon from Aetna Furniture stores delivered all the items that I purchased in timely manner. They were both very professional, positive, and honest about doing their job. I had 2 items with upgraded white glove service for them to assemble a king size bed and a computer desk. They were very quick about doing the assembly for them.
I would definitely recommend to others for Ilia and Levon and I would love to get their assistance again next time.<//Text>

<Text>I cannot say enough good things about Aetna Furniture. From start to finish the service has been amazing. I am now a happy owner of a brand new bed!

Not only did they offer the cheapest price for the bed frame I wanted, but they made sure to keep an open line of communication the whole way through. Paul was very accommodating with a last minute address hangs.

Andrew and Alex came to my apartment and assembled the bed in record time. I would absolutely recommend this to all of my friends. GO WITH WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY!!!

Thank you Aetna for all your help :)</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Ordered from this store, was excited by the low price. I was informed via email to provide confidential information in order to confirm my order, once completed...they stated they would update me when my order would be sent out. They never informed until 20+ days later. Waste of my time and money.<//Text>

Dima and IIyas did an excellent job getting my furniture delivered to me. They were punctual, friendly and set everything up quick and then cleaned up every little piece that was left over! They made sure they looked over the entire coffee table to assure it was in good condition. They found a “little scratch” and took care of it right away! Thank you again for your great service guys!</Review>

I never normally leave reviews but I am so upset and angry about the customer service at this retailer.
I ordered a $250+ dresser that the delivery guy delivered inside my door - still boxed - and then left. I took the item out of the box and IMMEDIATELY noticed it was damaged - Marks up the side of the item and that the second drawer does not close properly and the colouring of the handles was not the same as pictured and written online (silver and not brass as I wanted). I called Aetna straight away - within 20 minutes of the delivery even! - noting the problems and that I would like it returned. I was told I had to email and could not reach anyone by phone to voice the issues or have it picked back up now.
After back and forth I was basically sent the refund policy with parts highlighted saying that it had to be in the original box (it is so not sure how this is relevant?!), the damage needs to be noted on the delivery note (If it was noted damage why should I have accepted it, and if they did not stay for it to be unboxed then how would the damage be noted?!) and that if I want specific colours I need to contact them first and it’s not always accurate on their website (so then what’s the point of the description if it can be completely different?!)
I can’t believe they then offered me a *$30* refund for a brand new faulty item that cost me $300 and I reported faulty within *30* minutes of receiving! That’s a complete insult.
Maybe if your item is delivered and there’s no problems this company is a 5*. But a business in my opinion is rated on how they deal with the issues. And this company is terrible. I’m now out of pocket $300 for a damaged dresser. Be warned.< /text>

The people that work here are really nice and the delivery was great. But, the quality of furniture is not the best. The seam is falling apart  after just 4 weeks of owning the sofa.< /review>

<rating>3</rating><review>Aetna Stores made us this beautiful sectional , according to all Our specifications, they suggested fabric , shape and color of the legs along with all the finer details that really makes our couch beautiful but also very very comfortable. The only drawback is you have to be ready to follow up and expect a delay in timelines but this is the case with every furniture store in the bay, they were nice enough to waive off delivery charges . It was definitely worth the wait as we get complements on our coach every time! I would definitely refer them and it's a much better and more feasible option no doubt then any other furniture stores. Thank you snow and team.</review>< Pics>

Vlad and Serg came and outdid themselves with the delivery. They had to maneuver around a ton of plants and statues to bring my coach in. Thanks you two!<//review>

They don’t have everything at the store, I drove 1 hour from home with traffic and waisted my time
No guarantee at all
They advertise 10% discount but the night before they change the prices setting more expensive ones
They don’t have a name on the wall, I was lost driving around the same place and I couldn’t see the sign
They charge you a delivery for every item not for the same service, if you buy 5 item you pay 5 deliveries !
They have only at the store the used items that the costumer return
And so on< /review>

Not knowing what to expect, we were quite pleased with the quality of the furniture, the variety of options, and without planning on it, ended up buying a gorgeous leather sofa sectional and it was delivered that same night.</review>< Pictures>
