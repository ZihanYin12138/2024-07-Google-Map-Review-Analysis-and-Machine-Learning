tandard good thin-crust pizza, I would get it again, but it wouldn't be my first pick. Ordered delivery, a medium create-your-one pizza because we were feeling indecisive. You can choose your own toppings or choose from their menu of specialty pizzas. When you choose your own, they have way more options to choose from than you normally do at other places. You can choose what cheese they use, which sauce, and an array of different toppings. We got pepperoni, arugula, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and olive oil. It was delivered within 45 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised, but not wowed. It was thin-crust, and a little crispy with each bite. No complaints.</review>

I ordered buffalo wings and I got barbecue wings. They say they check the food but do they really. I didn’t know papa johns doesn’t know the difference between buffalo and barbecue. I recommend Domino’s pizza because I have never gotten a wrong order from them. I wish they would really check the food.</text>

The people who work there are really nice. But... we ordered two pizzas: a meaty one and a veggie one. The veggie pizza was a mess, the topping were patchy, it had bold spots, and puddles of grease.
So of you are ordering, order the meaty pizza, do not order any vegetables.< /text>

I have ordered 2 times from this location and both times I had a great experience.  I usually do not eat bread or cheese because they make me bloat.

I ate 3 slices of their pizza and all was good!  No bloating and no indigestion.  Highly recommended.<//review>

Its funny how one "eh" experience can alter your opinion about a place but usually they are spot on, its fully cooked, topped with a good amount of your choices of which, and very delicious.  Mouth watering even.  Just once out of 20 wasnt spot on</review>

< review>
In 1984, a younger “Papa” John (Schnatter) transformed a broom closet in his dad's tavern, located in Jeffersonville, Indiana, into a pizza kitchen. He purchase the pizza oven selling his prized, 1971 Camaro Z28.

Fifty years pass so quickly. I'm picking up an order at the Sherman Oaks, independently owned pizzeria that is a Papa John's franchise. The owner, who is also the chef, was knowledgeable and friendly. We bought two large pizzas, one all cheese. And a second, thick crust, vegan pizza, made without cheese. "Papa's" tomato sauce is thick and delicious. The onions, mushrooms and peppers are pilled high, and best of all, both pizzas were cooked perfectly, crisp and well browned.

Everything is wheelchair accessible. Street meter parking is tight. Van Nuys Boulevard is a busy street.  Be careful, exiting your car can be difficult.

Now I've heard of New York Pizza. I've heard of Chicago Pizza. But an Indiana pizza in Los Angeles? Papa would be confused, but proud.< /review>

Good pizza. You can find discount coupons in many places. TMobile gives you 25-50% off. Just check pizza before you leave the store so you don't get home and find out you got the wrong kind like I did.< /Review>

<review>Terrible Customer Service.  Called and asked what time 'Pick-up" was available until, was told 11pm by an employee.  Called back at 10:30pm and was told that 'Pick-up" ended at 10pm.  When I mentioned that I had just called an hour before and was told 11pm the current employee on the phone said, "oh, there is a new girl working, she probably didn't know."

Asked if I could received complimentary delivery due to the poorly educated/trained new employee who was allowed to answer the phones and give improper information to customers.  Said employee passed me onto the manager.  Enter MANAGER JANE - who not only said there was nothing she could do but further said there was no way she could confirm that I was even telling the truth... Uh, because I have better things to do with my evening than attempt to defraud a Papa John's restaurant to save a delivery charge!

She made absolutely no effort to offer anything in compromise for her employees not answering customers questions accurately, not even complimentary sauces or a $2 soft drink... NOTHING.  I did however receive an apology that I was such an offended customer and that she was not able to satisfy me.  That would be like me saying, "hey, sorry I rear ended your car and that you're so upset about it but there is nothing I can do..."

Will NEVER again go to a Papa John's after this experience.  Shame that such a great company could have such a poor management problem which costs the company loyal customers whose business will now be going to a competitor.  Bravo Papa John and Manager Jane!< /review><UserId.>103120277331397271371<//UserId.><username>Jason Feltz< /username>< Gmap_id>

The owner personally supposedly was gonna credit a complimentary meal  the whole order was to be redone right the next visit. Weeks paseed by I tried calling to order and redeem my credit but there was only partial credit. So the point of the story coming from the top THE OWNER IS NOT TRUST WORTHY HE LIED TO HIS EX LOYAL CUSTOMER. SO IF THE OWNER IS A LIAR WHAT CAN I EXPECT FROM THE CREW WHO DO NOT MAKE LARGE PROFITS OF MONEY. MY ADVICE STAY AWAY HE IS PROBABLY USING EXPIRED PRODUCTS AS WELL. DISHONEST I NOT WISH FOR ANYONE TO WASTE THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS LOCATION OR DO WHAT I DID DO NOT ORDER PAPA JOHN'S EVER  DOMINOES PIZZA. PIZZA HUT LITTLE CEASER.

<Review>Danielle is 5 star service!!
She did an awesome job helping us to tastefully finish of sunken tub project.

Actually pulling samples so we could hands one see and feel them was greatly appreciated.
Would highly recommend her for all your tiles needs

Design consultant, Danielle, was very helpful, knowledgeable of their product, and great with customer service. She was able to find the correct color and design of the ceramic floor tile I was looking for.

On top of that,  she was able to shipped me the tile sampler at home. It's a perfect match.< /Review>

<Review>Went to Daltile today to discover, though it's reflected they're open until 2pm on Saturdays for in-store shopping, they require an appointment according to a sign on the door. If you call, no one answers, you must leave
a message.  After months of shutdown, this seems like a poor business model. If you need to see their showroom, go to any restaurant bathroom in the city, but for a higher end look, shop smaller boutique tile stores. Home Depot Design Center has better pricing on Daltile for the less discriminating shopper. Sadly, some businesses have failed during the pandemic through no fault of their own. Daltile is working hard to discourage business. Went to San Diego Marble and Tile.<//Review>< pictures>

SIMPLY TRYING TO SEE MY SLAB CHOICE ON A COUNTERTOP TO GET A VISUAL ONLINE BEFORE MAKING THE DRIVE OVER THERE WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. THE MOST DIFFICULT WEBSITE I HAVE EVER USED....ALL i COULD EVER SEE WAS A SMALL CIRCLE OF THE WHAT THE SLAB WOULD LOOK LIKE. WILL NEVER EVER SHOP HERE AGAIN!</review>

Convenient location, small but nicely displayed showroom.  But, the young lady, Sandra, a design consultant was very helpful as we considered different kitchen tiles.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and very patient while we considered different combinations.

Thank you!<//Review>

The lady helping my family, has a bad attitude, and a horrendous attention to helping people. She is monotoned and has no desire to seem to help anyone. And her attention to paying attention to what samples we want was terrible, after telling her more than twice she still cannot understand which samples we want. She was extremely pushy about everything and was very impatient about the whole ordeal. I personally would not recommend to see this lady, her name is she Sandra and her coworker pushed us outside to look at countertops even though we could not purchase one since they only sell whole slabs and we needed a half slab.<//text>

Gorgeous showroom, and gorgeous tile.

But God help you if you have extra materials left after your project is finished and you want to return them. The contractors' desk is only open from 7AM-4PM weekdays, when I work at a demanding job, and has no weekend hours.  The showroom, which is one door down in the same building, adamantly refuses to process returns, or even hold them until the contractors' office opens next day, for phone processing.

I've spent thousands there on a recent remodel, and they won't even extend themselves to accept a box of tile as a return--mind you, this tile is $50 a box, so that's a sum that might matter to a frugal customer.</Text>

Rudest people I have encountered in a long time.  Went to the showroom by mistake and was met by a rude salesgirl that seemed bothered to help us.  Then get to the right place the guy behind the desk was too bothered with his personal texting to even look up to see someone was standing there or he just didn't care.  Seemed work was a hindrance to his personal time.  Then we were helped by yet another rude guy that for a min or so I didn't know if he was helping us at all only for him to look up and give me a total for the invoice.  Ok thanks bud! Just have your contractor deal with them, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!</Text>

It was a nice stop to enjoy Newport. We enjoyed the shaved ice with vanilla ice cream. I enjoyed the manjo, and others had grape and cherry.<//text>

I take my family to this place many times a year! This is my favorite spot to to have a good dinner.  I visit this spot many times. The meals are just great, the crew is friendly and the payment is reasonable. I enjoy being in this place to have a nice lunch.< /Review>

<text>Had a great bike ride from Huntington Beach to the Newport Beach Balboa peninsula. Stopped here to grab a bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised that they carried a New Mexico Chile hamburger which was quite good. I had their combo which added fries (cooked to a nice golden brown and had a crispy exterior with a soft interior) and a fountain drink. While this was not fantastic, it exceeded my expectations of tasteless food by a large amount. We were fortunate enough to sit at one of the benches on the grass and could view the beach, people watch as countless people strolled along the pathway. Between the food, Beach, and spectical of people watching, I was highly enamored during my visit.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>A little pricey but balances out when putting into consideration the real estate value and views. Enjoy some classic American fast food on cement benches while people watching and taking in where sand meets sea. The Double bacon cheeseburger hit the spot by also adding grilled onions. The strawberry shake was a sweet beverage straight from heaven!<//text>< pics>

Today, my son went to order two orders of fries. My son came back with one order of fries and I have been buying fries from them for about 1 year. My son came back with one order of fries and then I went to go back to them and the employee started lying to me that they changed the size of the fries bag and he gave me a little bag of fries as a joke too. He tried laughing in front of my face and lie too.</Text>

Had the bacon cheeseburger. Bacon was hard and old, bun was stale, meat tasted like costco food, I basically had to pick it apart. I didn't even get to the tomatoes and lettuce under the meat because it was too soggy. 8 hours later debilitating stomach cramps...ER visit. Food poisoning!</review>

<Review>Super delicious "silver lake burger"! I asked no onions but still received lotsa onions on my phone order. (It was EMPTY when I went 130pm so I'm surprised they messed it up)

Didn't care bout the lingering onion flavor cuz it was still tasty. NO NEED for fries cuz burger is so big. Had a caramel malt with it- that's all u need for avg stomach size.

Yes InNOut is cheaper, but they don't take phone orders or offer same variety.</Review>< Rating>

This place is great! For being on the beach,  Pipeline has the best prices, convenience, and selection. I got the salmon burger which was only $6 (a steal for on-the-beach), it was very good.  All of their other food that my family ordered was great also.  There are only 2 less than perfect comments I have about Pipeline: after ordering our food, it took quite a while to receive it, and second, their ketchup packets are really small.<//Text>

Great location!  We were here in October and the owner was great to my kids.  We rented body boards, beach chairs, etc.. Great place for food while you are on the beach as well.  Great service!</review>

<Review>They rent beach chairs, beach umbrellas, boogie boards, and bicycles at reasonable prices at the foot of the Newport Beach Pier. This was great for a family that was in the area visiting.</Review>< GmapID>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>We ordered food for a family of 4, and it took probably 25 minutes to receive our food (they were not busy at all - I think 1 person was in line in front of us).  When we did receive the food, they had messed up my husband's order, which he had made sure to repeat to them prior to ordering to ensure they had it correct.  It took another 10 minutes to fix his order (which was really only adding bacon to a cheeseburger).  I ordered the turkey sandwich with green chilies.  The sandwich looked like a kindergartner had thrown it together.  The lettuce was wilted, and the cheese had crusty dried out edges like it had been sitting in the fridge uncovered for a few days.  Very disappointing.  The burger was good once we finally received it, but overall, this place left much to be desired.< /Review>< Pictures>

Years back a device insurance was added to my two upgrades even though it was not required according to Spring Get Human Help Line. After telling them so many times that I didn’t want insurance I still had the charge on my next monthly bill. Contacted customer support and they removed it. Not willing and capable of helping with the bill explanation. Only care about their commissions. Please learn to be a natural sales person, not a wolf.<//text>

The customer service was great! Very personable, and down to earth. And the prices are very competitive as well. I'm glad I made the switch.
I just made my first payment in store today. Daric, the person who originally helped me a few weeks ago with my new account remembered me, which is really awesome! Customer service was just as great as the last time. It's nice to be more than just an account number.</Text>

Very rude representatives. I advise you to stay away from this store and go somewhere else. These representatives here will not answer your questions and cheat you out of your money.<//review>

<gmapID>0x80dca746a5afc315:0x4c09c8d8aa601fb1< /gmapID><user_name>Fernando Sal y Rosas< /user_name><text>Very disappointed with their business techniques. After speaking with Andrew, I went in to open a new line of service and do an upgrade. A girl who's name I will gather tended to me. Toward the end she told I Had to buy phone insurance for 90 days and cancel thereafter, if not they couldn't finish the transaction. I refused and she refused to proceed unless I agreed to the insurance. I refused again and she refused to proceed and I walked away.

Called Sprint to report it and reported it to another agency as well.  Sprint stated that it was optional and those practices are not part of their practices and will look into the store.

Per Sprint; they should have proceeded with the transaction and never forced upon Optional phone insurance.

So beware of this if forced upon, call Sprint immediately and they'll cancel the insurance for you on the spot as well as notate their bad business practice.<//text><user>107242253616240462130</user>< Time>

We have been a loyal sprint customer for a very long time and we been in this store for since they open but this time this year its been worse both manger and the store associate are not honest in doing business so be very careful of what your signing and what they give or say its as free accesorry just pay the tax bec. in the end your going to pay for it without knowing and their customer service is rude and disrespecful they do personal text while talking and conducting bussiness in front of the customer they are serving at the time. This is not a sprint i know so dont go here beware 😡😡😡< /Text>

Terrible customer service! I went in there 3 days in a row to try and upgrade my phone and I still haven't done it because they are really slow! Then there are two girls who sit in the middle who don't seem to have a clue and do nothing and then they act like they don't see customers when they walk in, they're never busy but when they actually get customers, the wait is over an hour! Either they need to go back to training or somebody needs to get fired because this store really sucks!< /Review>

< review>
Best pizza in WEST HOLLYWOOD! Not only is the pizza great, but the food is authentic Italian cuisine! I found this place while walking my dog, as I passed by the restaurant I smelled the aroma of pizza and I had to turn back around and go inside. First they have hot and ready slices on display, I grabbed 2 slices, I must say it was the best pizza I've had in years. Since I had a big appetite from waking, I decided to try their Steak Entrée and Angel Hair pasta! The steak was nice and juicy, fries were crispy, golden & perfectly seasoned. The angel hair was heaven sent , this pasta is worthy of a Michilen Star! Over all, I would definitely eat from here each time I'm in the area. I order here weekly and their service is very prompt! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for amazing food (with great prices) when in West Hollywood.< /review>

The pizza here is very basic. It tastes like dough. Good for late night sobering up. Other than that, pass.< /Review>

<Review>Um. Delicious lasagna. Huge calzone. Ample servings. Hands-down one of the best sauces I’ve had outside my grandma’s recipe (please don’t crush me and say it’s out of a jar). I’ll pass on the garlic bread again (fine but not great, especially as compared with the other delicious stuff) but other than that ... molto bene<//Review><user_name>Jenn Capuzelo Kiel<//user_name><Rate>5<//Rate>< pics>

Great pizza, not super clean or fancy. Reasonable prices for the location. I’ll pass on the baked goods next time though.
Ordered: slices of pepperoni, pep/mush, pep/mush/sausage, and spinach. Peanut butter blondie, Honest Tea, and San Pelligrino.<//Text>

< Review>
Local pizza, pasta, and sub place. They have counter serve, fresh order made, and delivery. The atmosphere is basic and rustic. Indoor and outdoor seating available

Pros:

Quick polite service
Good food at a reasonable price
Wide selection to choose from, including vegetarian and gluten free

Cons:
Counter food sits.... and sits...
The dining room upkeep is meh, finding a clean table even during a slow time can be a challenge

The staff is nice but unmotivated, be patient and willing to ask for things like a clean table, napkins, etc.

Overall an OK place.</Review>

Had one of the worst pastrami sandwiches here. Hardly any meat but plenty of bread. Other dishes I've seen people order have looked average at best.<//review>

<Text>Blast from the past.. Still serving it up until 3am, a great place for a slice after clubbing. Ordered a pizza while visiting a friend the other day, it was very oily. Had to blot it a lot. Very good though.</Text>< pics>

<review>Great pizza and meatball sandwiches. . .You may have to ask for a little extra sauce or cheese (Jersey Style) but it is well worth it.  Buy by the pie in my opinion.  The slices are great, but you are gonna want more anyway so you might as well give in right off the bat and have some left for cold breakfast and to be toasted up for lunch in the office the next day or two in the office. . .excellent delivary as well and I recommend going straight through them and avoiding bigger apps due to the additional surcharge.  Garlic bread is meh, and calzones need work. . .but eat in "eat out" ♡HAPPY PRIDE♡ this little joint and Mama will shortly become one of your homes away from home. . .especially if you are a blue collar East Coast transplant like me.  Tell 'em Mama kel sent ya.  That and $5 will get you a sweet slice of gooey home.  Spread love.< /review>< pictures>

We used to order pizza a lot at work (I suggest the Pesto with Chicken, Sausage, and Mushrooms)  I also LOVE their submarine sandwiches and their greek salad.

The woman that owns this restaurant is VERY nice and appreciates return business and customers.  She rocks.  We had 1 bad pizza delivery and when I went in a month later to the store to tell her about it she completely hooked me up.

Cons:
I'm not a fan of their meatballs but my other co workers loved them
Certain pizza cookers can make the crust too thick - we all enjoy it when the crust is more thin than thick

Pros:
Awesome service if the owner is working
Great sauce and toppings
Great submarine cold cut subs!<//review>

Wow. What a change over the past few years.  Cold pizza.   I could walk in here any night over the past 15+ years and count on a warm-hot slice of pizza. If it wasn’t the right temp they’d reheat in the oven. No more, in/out. No QC. Recipe remains same but the experience and presentation has changed a lot.</text>

<Review>My favorite is the potbelly pizza with caramelized onion, , preserved lemon, and arugula.  I have never had *lemon* on a pizza before, and really like the zest.

It's a four dollar slice of pizza when most other cities its at 1 or 2. They suffer from having to be in LA. The bonus is they sell cigarettes</Review>

It's a favorite.  I drive down from Thousand Oaks to grab a slice.  The parking attendants starting trying to charge me to park in the back lot, even if I bring a receipt showing I was a paying customer, just in and out in 20 minutes....  If you park at Pavillions you get a ticket ... So I don't go down to get pizza anymore.<//Text>

Unbelievably this place has the best Fettuccine Alfredo in town.
The other thing that I am noticing is that this place is very under priced for the quality of their food.
I like their Pizza too.

I wasn't sure if certain parts of what I was chewing was cheese or uncooked dough. After 20 minutes, you would have thought it would be thoroughly cooked.

Amazing experience! Best way to do this is get the earliest massage possible and spend your day around the pool and on the patio! Highly recommend bringing a book and sunglasses and head outside to get a great view of the city. Massages have always been top notch and facilities are great!</Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>it's pretty terrible. First, it is super crowded. When I was looking for hot water for tea, two staff who have been there for over 20 years couldn't care less to help me. Second, the facial is horrible. I specifically asked for disposable pads to wash my face, the lady just ignored me and kept using the towel on my face, which they just send to normal laundry. Later I found there are some disposable pads on the table, I don't know why she just couldn't use those! There are lots of gems and viruses attached to the towel, which absolutely shouldn't be used for the face! Right after the exfoliation, they put a hot towel on my face, my face was burning! Anyways, I feel they just don't actually care. If you come for the pool and sauna it is fine, the actual facial services are very substandard, far far away from hotel services.</review>< Rate>

< review>
I travel to Asia 5  - 6 times a year and like to get a massage when I return to help with jet lag. This morning I arrived from Singapore and phoned Huntington Spa to get an appointment. They could fit me in tomorrow but insisted on getting a credit card number.  I have had my card used fraudulently and do not like revealing it on the phone in public places. They know I already been there 2 - 3 times before and my credit is good. I demonstrated that I am responsible when once I called from China to cancel an appointment. If I could email or text them I would but I cannot. They take only phone calls. My experience agrees with other commenters who find Huntington non-customer oriented and inflexible. No worries. I found somewhere else.< /review>

It starts at the reception with one of the receptionists who seemed to be the one on charge, being forceful and rude, requiring my credit card pre-treatment while knowing I was using a gift certificate. Then I had to heavily insist about getting my size slipper and robe. The spa attendant was arguing with me that it would be “too big and that people don’t like when it’s big”. It was in front of patrons and very awkward, she went on to unfolding the robe to prove to me it would sufficient. After I insisted for the bigger size, she remained in the lounge, folding back the robe, while I was waiting for her to get me another one!
While the therapists was lovely, respectful and did a great job, I will never go back. There are enough wonderful spas in the city to not have to endure this type of BS.< /text></record>

<review>Great treatments and massage. The facilities have seen better days though. I was there on a Friday and it was pretty busy, so we had to wait to use one of the two(!) showers in the ladies' room. Food is mediocre.<//review><user_id>110164671966424560475<//user_id><pictures>None</pictures>< username>

Very disappointed! I paid for one hour and the massage was just for 40mins, plus I had a voucher and they charged my credit card also and I had to deal with all these! Not going back again!</Text>

<text>So, we are visiting San Francisco. My wife was super excited about a massage and a facial and she had heard good things about this dump. My wife had set up the services the day before because I was going to be in meetings all day. Well unfortunately I’m San Francisco the day of the service a protest march or rally or whatever you want to call it popped up. They closed down the trolleys and my wife called asking if she could come later if she could switch days if she could just get some help. They said come as quick as you can and whatever time you have left of your hour you can use. So if t cost us $150 for a ten minute massage. That’s just unprofessional it’s just honestly pathetic. They didn’t say hey we understand don’t worry about it, they just gladly stole the money. I wouldn’t recommend this place for nothing because that’s what they provided us, nothing. A charge of $150 for a ten minute massage, I just can’t believe they couldn’t work around this. A perfect example of terrible customer service. Horrible customer service, honestly no customer service. If we canceled and she asked because it was less than 24 hours she would have been charged also. My wife found a bus got dropped of in the vacinity and ran up Knob Hill and had ten minutes to spare. I still can’t believe it, buyer beware, do not go here. Money or nothing, no sympathy no empathy no nothing. Horrible horrible horrible. Who would run a business this way?</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1550011691148</time>< UserId.>

Great spa in a classic SF neighborhood. The pool and patio are coed spaces, but the saunas and steam rooms are located in the male and female locker rooms. I had a massage and it was fantastic...the right combination of pressure to get the knots out and relax.<//Review>

Spa facilities are in desperate need of an update and improvement in hydro maintenance. I liked the attentive customer service and the fact they serve food in the pool area, but the manky shower area with dirty grout and foam (!) in the jacuzzi when the jets were on made me not want to come back. The sauna is an insult to saunas everywhere; there was even a sign above the kiuas instructing visitors to enjoy the dry sauna and not to put water on the rocks! If I wanted to sit next to a toaster in a closet (which is apparently their idea of a sauna?) I wouldn't pay for the privilege. Finally, as with every spa, the level of quality of massage and treatment depends on the technician; but even the best massage needs to work extremely hard to rise above the level of the facilities that are in straight up disrepair.</Text>

Huge guest rooms, a lovely spa, excellent service.  The bar/restaurant is chic and old school. It's perched atop California Street so the view is dreamy.< /review>

<review>We are thrilled with my soon to be wife's ring. Bert and his team were very friendly and attentive. They served us tea and made us feel very welcomed. We tried several rings before choosing this beautiful emerald cut halo diamond ring set in platinum. This is a no stress, no pressure establishment. Don't look any further, visit his store today.<//review>< Rate>

One of the beautiful things about a halo design is that the surrounding diamonds not only look beautiful but they also give an image of completeness and eternity, signifying your love is without beginning or end but will always be. With platinum symbolizing purity, it also tells us your love is a pure love. I’m confident you two have a forever love, just like your forever diamonds.

She explained and taught my wife and I why diamonds can be reasonably priced and why some are just way up there in price.  Once you know this information it is easier to make a selection.
Bert designed a custom ring for the diamond and it came out unbelievable.  He is a true artist.
If you want to find a great price on jewelry, especially diamonds, Bert and Gloria are the people to meet.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1621568509425, 'text': 'Frank, I want to thank you for you very nice feedback. I’ve shared with Gloria and the rest of the staff at Bert Levi Jewelers how much you appreciated the service. I’m glad you took the time to talk about Gloria’s diamond knowledge. I believe a person ought to have all of the information necessary to make a decision, and that’s why I always try to make sure they know what makes one diamond a better choice than another. With the real knowledge, you can buy a diamond that’s reasonably inexpensive but mount it in a way that exemplifies its shimmer and shine. There is nothing like good information to help someone make a good decision. As for the custom design, I’m happy you liked it. People fall in love in different ways and different aspects of the relationship mean more to one couple than another. Jewelry is a very personal thing, and I am always happy when I get a chance to help someone that fits the personalities involved. Again, thank you very much for the wonderful review. We’re looking forward to helping you with anything you need in the future or just getting a chance to have a conversation. Drop by anytime. Have a very nice day!😊'}< /Response><GmapID>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410</GmapID></record>

<review>Totally recommended. Great customer service. They know what they sell and they have the passion to sell it. We bought my son his first Rolex Bert was fantastic in explaining everything. We will for sure be back.. honest people. Gave a 5 stars cause we cant do 10. But this jewelry store deserves more .<//review>< response>
{'time': 1621515220728, 'text': 'Nancy, how very kind it was of you to leave your feedback. I enjoyed visiting with you, and I think it is a wonderful thing that you were able to get a Rolex for your son. Rolex is, of course, the premier name in fine mechanical Swiss timepieces. To me, a Rolex is special because it celebrates the idea of time itself. Life itself is simply the use of time, and if we value life, we must value time. Every moment we spend using our time in a productive or enjoyable way shows value, and celebrating that value is what a luxury watch is all about. I love that we were able to provide your son’s first Rolex, and I am sure he will enjoy it for many years to come. The wonderful thing about a Rolex is that with basic care and maintenance, it will still be enjoyed by his children and his children’s children, too. Thank you again for being the most important part of our business, a wonderful customer, and thank you for the kind review. Stop by anytime. We would love to see you😊'}<//response>

It’s hard to describe such an amazing and  perfectly run business like Bert Levi  & Family Jewelers. From the moment you walk into the establishment you are greeted with a warm smile & offer of tea, this all lends to the welcome feeling you get when in their shop.  The individualized service makes shopping a truly unique & enjoyable time.  The prices can’t be beat for the stunning quality that is offered.  I’d recommend them to anyone, especially after purchasing my wedding ring set from them.  Again a remarkable establishment with attention to detail that is amazing.<//Review>

As a small family business, this kind of word of mouth help is really valuable. I want to thank you for taking the time to describe how you felt in our showroom. Persian tea is not only important to our culture but really represents how we feel about customers. We make an offer because we want our customers feel like family. This kind of tea is brewed very, very strong and then at the end, more steaming water is added until it’s just perfect. There is tradition behind that care and attention to detail. For us, sharing tea is something that makes a guest a part of our family for just a while, and since it is important to us to treat our customers like we want family to be treated, it is just a matter of course to make the offer. Thank you again for your review and I’m very happy we were able to find a perfect wedding set for you. Don’t forget to bring your wedding bands back for free cleaning whenever you’d like, and I hope you know you’re always welcome to drop by for conversation or, of course, for a nice cup of tea.'}< /response>< gmap_id>

A small family business such as ours can’t compete with the giant chain jewelry stores when it comes to marketing budgets so we rely on customers like you to share your experience and get the word out. I’m really glad you like your sapphire necklace, and it’s especially nice that you bought it to match a family heirloom. I learned at a very early age that jewelry isn’t just the precious metal and the gem stones but has meaning that is special and important to the people involved. Your aunt’s ring means a great deal to you, of course, and I’m so happy you found a necklace to match. You may not know that sapphires represent protection and strength. Perhaps when you wear the necklace and the ring, you can think about how they are symbols of how your family protects you and gives you strength. Again, thank you so much, and please drop by any time for cleaning or, even if you don’t need that, just to have a cup of Persian tea and conversation😊'}<//Response><UserId.>103983153317792796368<//UserId.><rate>5<//rate><username>Erin Jacobs< /username>< Date>

Things like that happen, and they are always frustrating for everyone involved. I’m glad you got in touch with us so we could be with you every step of the way dealing with the stress it created. Although I’ve been in business for more than thirty years, I have to admit I’m sometimes amazed at how just treating people the way we would want to be treated has such a positive impact on their experience. We found you a charming and personable gentleman, and I enjoyed helping you get you the watch you wanted and I’m glad you’re happy with it. Some people don’t understand the appeal of a really fine timepiece. For me, I think the attention to detail in the mechanical workings of a watch like the one you bought shows a full commitment to the magic of every single second. It’s a celebration of the fact that life is made up of time and recognizing its value is the key to making the most out of it. When you wear your watch, you’re wearing a piece of history, so wear it proudly. Again, thank you very much for taking the time to write what you wrote.

I had a very stressful and bad experience with the shipping (which was not his fault, it was the weather that caused a huge delay) Bert made sure to notify me and told me not to worry as everything was insured- his lovely wife was always giving me updates and available for any questions i had. Businesspeople like these are very rare nowadays, which is why i will continue to do business with them. I highly recommend them, not just for their extraordinary service but for their knowledge, and variety of high quality timepieces and jewelry. When he says he is always available to his clients, he means it- and someone like that is hard to find. I wish them continued success and will always keep them in mind when i need to purchase a nice Timepiece, i was very happy with my purchase.<//review>< UserId.>

It”s one of my favorite Rolex models, with a wonderful history. In today’s world of computer technology, it”s easy to forget that keeping time underwater wasn’t really possible until Swiss watchmakers developed the technology to give accurate measures in that environment. One of the wonderful things about a fine mechanical watch is that it celebrates time and how humanity developed ways of measuring it accurately and then putting that measurement to use no matter where a person happened to be, even in the ocean. A person who values life values time, and the Rolex Submariner is a perfect example. I’m sure you are right about treasuring your watch, by the way.

As a small family business, word of mouth like this means a great deal to us. It was a great pleasure to help you with your Tiffany solitaire ring. Tiffany is not only an iconic brand that revolutionized the jewelry industry but was also the first company to focus on the natural beauty of the materials, and your ring is certainly beautiful. A solitaire not only means a single diamond but it also means a single focus, in this case the love you feel for your wife and the commitment that brings to your relationship. If you think about it, any time a person has a true, prioritized focus, that focus characterizes everything in their life. In the context of your lovely anniversary gift, this means everything in your life is characterized by your love for your wife and your commitment to the relationship. I think that’s lovely. Thank you for allowing us to serve you and we can’t wait to see you again. You don’t have to wait until you’re in the market for more jewelry.

{'time': 1613256758656, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review, Mr. Hurley. It’s always an encouragement to everyone here when a customer shares a positive experience, and I appreciate you more than you know. I hope Mrs. Hurley’s new diamond ring will help to make your 40th anniversary celebration especially wonderful for the two of you. We always tell young couples just starting out that it’s a much better idea to buy well within their price range and then upgrade later, and helping people to do that is one of my favorite things to do as a jeweler. It was kind of you to point out that you found what we had to offer worth travelling 700 miles for, especially after you looked at dozens of other places. We strive to be a store worthy of that sort of thing, and when it works out it’s just great for everyone. Usually, I end a response like this with an invitation to drop by anytime for Persian tea and conversation even if you don’t have any jewelry business. Of course, that is usually something locals do. Whenever you end up in San Diego, though, please drop by even if you don’t plan on buying anything. We would love to see you. I can’t tell you how happy we are to be your personal family jewelers, and we’ll do our best to make sure you’re always just as happy about it as you are today!'}</response>
<review>I recently purchased a large solitaire diamond from Bert Levi Family Jewelers and couldn't be more pleased or impressed!  The selection was amazing, the prices were fair - and the service (Bert, his wife Gloria, and his sister) were friendly, helpful, accommodating, simply just fantastic!!  I have searched jewelers for several years looking for the perfect diamond to upgrade the engagement ring for my beautiful wife for our upcoming 40th anniversary and finally found the perfect ring (with a few months to spare) with Bert and his family at a price that was very fair.  The dozens of chain and other jewelry stores I searched through either had diamonds that were not the right size, the right quality, or the right price (and usually very pushy) so I was very happy to find what I was looking for at Bert's family store. We travelled 700 miles to make our purchase and now consider Bert and his family our own personal family jewelers and will definitely be back for purchases small and large!<//review><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Absolutely love my vintage ring. Great service, friendly couple that made our engagement trip so special.

<Response>{'time': 1613517030350, 'text': 'Blake, thank you very much for sharing your feedback like this. It is always encouraging to hear about a great experience from a customer, and Gloria and I were happy to meet you and thankful you gave us an opportunity to be a part of your special day. For many years, I’ve maintained that jewelry is special because of the relationships involved. That’s why metals and gems turn into something so much more when two people in love use them to commemorate their relationship. One of the reasons we go out of our way to stock vintage rings is because there is character and warmth in them that we know appeals to people in a very special fashion. It was a great idea to turn picking it up into a romantic getaway, and I have to admit I’m proud of how wonderful a romantic getaway destination San Diego can be.

Bert Levi Family Jewelers is by far one of the best jewelry stores in San Diego County. Their service is exceptional, their jewelry is stunning and their prices are the best I’ve ever seen. So if you’re looking to buy something special for your wife, your daughter a relative, a significant other or who ever stop by Bert Levi Family Jewelers I guarantee you’ll be happy you did...I was!< /review>

Great little high end watch and jewelry shop!  Great friendly service and my wife was able to get a new Rolex watch.  Excellent price as well. We'll definitely consider this place again in the future.

Highly recommended.</text>

We always do our best to satisfy our customers and it means a lot to us when we succeed well enough that someone leaves us a review.

I’m glad you’re happy with your experience with us and happy to know we might see you again. The Rolex Wimbledon is a great watch, isn’t it? When Rolex became the official timekeeper for Rolex, they made the watch to commemorate all of the achievements in the sport. I think recognizing achievement is important but to me, the watch exemplifies how important time really is. From a sport like tennis to any other activity, we are all constrained by time. Understanding how to measure our time and maximize what we can accomplish with it is the key to success, I think. This is, to me, what makes this watch special as well as the Rolex brand in general. I know you’ll be happy with it, and I’m looking forward to seeing you again.

Was referred by a friend 10 years ago and bought a beautiful 2 ct cushion cut ring— the quality, service, prices, value and no pressure sales of Levi are just a few of the reasons I have returned over and over again even though I now live 8 hrs away. I recently wanted a new setting for the ring I bought 10 years ago and Bert patiently worked with me over text with pictures until we found the perfect setting to go out with my unique wedding & anniversary bands...and I could not be happier with the finished product!</Text>

I think it’s a lovely cut, and it is not only unique in today’s world but also has warmth and character that is simply beautiful. I know you will treasure the new stetting as much as you treasured the first over the years.

I’m happy you enjoyed your experience with our store and I’m so glad your wedding band looks brand new again. We’ve been in business for a very long time, and you can imagine just how many wedding bands I’ve had the privilege to deliver to a happy customer. I really enjoy getting to play a part in such an important symbol of the love between people. Did you know the first wedding bands were probably woven reeds in Mesopotamia? The circle was believed to symbolize a gate to another world, a beautiful heavenly world. When a person wore the ring, it symbolized how the love and marriage meant entering a brand new world. Of course, the circular shape with no beginning nor end also symbolizes eternal, everlasting love, the kind of love that makes a marriage really special. I’m happy we were able to get your wedding ring back to where you wanted it, and I hope when you look at it, it reminds you of all the significance of the relationship. I’m looking forward to you coming back when you have more jewelry needs but please remember, you can stop by for conversation and maybe a cup of tea whether or not you’re in the market to buy anything.'}< /Resp>

My fiancé and I were fortunate enough to meet Bert Levi and his beautiful wife Gloria years ago through a good friend. He knew we wanted to upgrade my engagement ring and Bert would be the best person to help us...turns out he was! Bert was very patient and walked us through our pricing options and educated us on the different cuts and qualities of various diamonds. It was a great experience and I got a gorgeous Ascher solitaire! We highly recommend him as your family jeweler and will continue doing business with him in the future.<//text>

{'time': 1614986408314, 'text': 'Laura, it was very kind of you to leave a review and we are just as happy we got to meet you years ago. The long relationships we get to develop is what really makes this life worthwhile, isn’t it? Gloria and I were glad we could help you with upgrading your engagement ring. I’m glad you thought I was patient but I have to tell you, I probably seemed patient just because I love talking about diamond cuts and qualities. Seriously, though, I think your engagement ring turned out beautifully. Did you know the Asscher cut is very rare? Only about two out of every hundred diamonds for jewelry are cut this way. It gives you the timeless character and warmth of a princess cut or emerald cut diamond but the shimmer and shine of a round brilliant. In short, it exemplifies good qualities of all the different cuts. It’s the most difficult diamond to cut and because less of the diamond remains after the cutting, many gem cutters choose a more economical choice. So, when you wear your ring, you can think of the diamond as special because really symbolizes the rare nature of your relationship, and the forever love you enjoy. You can also think about how the two of you help each other exemplify all the good qualities you have. I’m glad you love your ring and it’s always wonderful to see you. Gloria and I are looking forward to the next time already!'}<//response>

We all have the same twenty-four hours a day and how that time is spent determines how we enjoy our lives and, for that matter, how we impact others. I believe a focus on the present, on how time is spent at any given moment, can transform life. I love timepieces for that reason and I enjoy the opportunity to spend time with people who come into the store to explore the possibilities. Again, thank you very much for your feedback.

It has a lot of history, and when it was developed back in the beginning of the days of auto racing, people didn’t really understand accurate timekeeping was even possible for something like an auto race, or for that matter, any racing. Accurate time measurement and the relation to speed hadn’t been put in a timepiece before but the tachygraph bezel changed all that. Rolex has always understood the importance of time is what is done with it. Today, we think of a Rolex as a luxury item because of digital timekeeping and a timer and stopwatch on every phone but when this came out in 1963, it was the first real automatic way for a driver to tell speeds past what the speedometer could measure. It celebrated the use of time and time’s relation to our lives. Ultimately, if a person values life they have to value time and if they value time, they have to understand how they’re using it. This is one of my favorite models, and I’m so glad we got you the watch you’ve been searching for. Treasure it and it will still work for your children and your grandchildren. Thank you again and have a great day.'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

We strive to do all we can to make the customer experience positive, and since we’re a family business, it means a great deal to us when we can help someone and then also help their children or their parents. With wedding jewelry, there is a great deal of significance that goes beyond the materials, and that is why one of the most important things we can do is focus carefully on providing the best and loveliest work when it comes to an engagement ring. It symbolizes the love and the relationship your son and daughter in law share. As I recall, they had yellow gold and a diamond solitaire. That symbolizes a bright and shimmering marriage with a foundation of companionship and loyalty. I’m sure when your son sees it on his wife’s hand, he thinks along those lines, about his love for her, rather than about the diamond and the gold. Thank you again for your feedback, and I’m looking forward to taking care of the upgrades for you.'}</Response>

I brought a vintage engagement ring here to get cleaned and sized. Got it back a day earlier than expected and it looked amazing. Popped the question, and turned out it was still a touch to big. Brought it back to get sized again, and got the ring back on time with no charge for the second sizing. The ring looks great, and she says it's a comfortable fit. There was a lot of trust needed as this was her grandmother's ring given to me by her parents, and the girls at Bert Levi Jewelers were outstanding. We have moved, but if I was still in the San Diego area, I would be doing all my jewelry business there. Would recommend to everyone.</Text>

<review>So, I'm changing my review...

My original review will be below, but I wanted to update to say that within 20 minutes of posting my review, someone from the store actually called me (not sure how he got my number, lol). He was very concerned, apologetic and honest. He did explain that they have to pay someone to size a bracelet, and that is why they charge. He also understood that it is important to be upfront about costs before making a purchase. I think that with this, I would probably recommend them with the caveat that you should always define any ancillary costs that may be associated with it post-purchase.

They seem very concerned with customer experience and opinion. So, I say give them a chance. If you have any issues, I feel very confident that they will do whatever they can (within reason) to make you feel good :)

I wound up going back in and buying a necklace for my husband, and got great service and a great deal, I feel. Very kind and responsive owner/employee.

Original Review:

Ok, so I have lived close to this store for a long time, and wanted to get my husband something nice for Christmas, even though we don't do gifts. I stopped in and settled on a nice yellow gold bracelet. I wasn't sure the size I should get, but I knew the one I picked out was close. The lady behind the counter was very nice and assured me that he could come in after Christmas and get it sized. She neglected to mention that she would charge us another $50 to do that. I GET that things cost money, but I never would have bought it without him there if I knew they were going to charge me even more.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1612191831521, 'text': 'Thank you so much for updating your review, Daniel. You should know a small family business like ours really relies on people such as yourself who share their experiences. We don’t have a giant marketing firm running commercials for us. It means a lot that you took the time to add to your original review and to let people know we did all we could to help you with the issue you encountered. As a third generation jeweler, I learned from my father and my grandfather that jewelry is more than just gold or gemstones. In fact, you bought the bracelet for your husband because of your love for him. It’s not just yellow gold links. It represents how you feel and will serve as a reminder to him of those feelings. Since yellow gold represents companionship and loyalty, there is really special meaning there. I’m sorry we weren’t clear about additional costs up front, and I’m glad you gave us a chance to show you we didn’t intend to neglect that at all. Thanks so much for the opportunity to fix things and thanks for letting people know we did. Please don’t hesitate to stop by if you’d like to have the bracelet cleaned or for any other reason. Even if you don’t have any jewelry needs, feel free to just stop by for a hello and some Persian tea😊'}<//Response>< gmapID>

I want to tell you, I am particularly happy that you will recommend us to any of your friends and family who have jewelry needs. That is the highest compliment anyone can pay us, and it means a great deal. We always do our best to treat customers like we would want our family members to be treated, and it feels good when we succeed. Again, thank you very much and we’re all looking forward to seeing you again.'}</resp>

Very pleasant. He checked on my husband when he was ill. He explained any questions that I was concerned about.

If needing jewelry Bert will work with you. I would refer him to family and friends.<//text>

What a lovely jewelry store and a gracious owner. Family business since 1979. They have a great selection of wedding bands and engagement rings. I enjoyed doing business with them.</Review>

Reviews are very encouraging for us and they also help others know what to anticipate. It was very kind of you to call us gracious. In fact, it was quite a gracious thing to do yourself. We have been in the engagement ring and wedding band business for a very long time, and our selection is large because we believe every relationship is special and unique and wedding jewelry should reflect the people involved. A multitude of designs helps people to find the ring that really works for them. We do a great deal of customization as well. Jewelry in many ways carries a great deal more emotional weight than other purchase, and we do our best to respect that. It was very kind of you to share your experience, and I want to thank you again and remind you that you’re welcome to drop by anytime for some Persian Tea and conversation, even if you aren’t in the market for any jewelry at the moment.'}<//Response><gmapID>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410<//gmapID></record>

<Review>They have amazing fine jewelry and their knowledge is absolutely amazing 🤩 customer service is top of the line as they give you all the attention and there’s nothing they don’t know about jewelry. Basically, they’re an encyclopedia of knowledge when it comes to jewelry, and I completely recommend them.</Review>< Date>

When my wife and I started Bert Levi Family Jewelers more than three decades ago, we decided we would always treat our customers with that in mind. For a jeweler, it was the sale of a bracelet. For you, it was a way to give your wife a stunning reminder of your love for her, something she could wear and think about you while she did. We strive to remember that kind of thing, and I’m happy when you’ve come into the store, we’ve treated you with the care you deserve.

{'time': 1614295925145, 'text': 'Mrs. Cantrell purchased a ring on Etsy and the shipping company made an error, losing it. Hopefully, it isn’t lost forever. It is clear there is nothing at all that can be done to satisfy her even though the shipping company made the mistake. Her money was refunded although we have not received the ring back, and yet she still sends threatening and mean-spirited emails. She has brought up our religion and promised to ruin our reputation. She further made a gleeful comment about us losing $1800 if the shipping company is unable to locate the ring and return it to us. Although we strive to create a positive customer experience for everyone, there are certain circumstances in transactions completely out of our control. We did our best to work with the shipping company and received abuse in return. The abuse has continued even after the money was refunded. For the first time in our history, we told a customer she was not welcome to return to our store. It is a very sad day for us to be forced to do that but we take heart because the way she treated the company and the way she treated my wife and I is not the norm. Nearly every one of our customers is wonderful, and whether the ring is returned, I accept an insurance payment for the loss or I just lose the money, it is a small price to pay to have no connection to this person any longer.'}<//Resp>

<Review>0 stars. My transaction with Levi Family Jewelers started off very well on Etsy, but when the ring was delivered to the wrong address, I respectfully and quickly sent proof and concerns to Mr. Levi. He denied any responsibility, suggested myriad ways I failed, and offered no solutions--all before doing any research into what happened.

His wife is very reasonable and kind, but even after finally acknowledging the ring went missing through no fault of my own, he began insisting I must return it if it ever gets delivered to me before I had proof of any refund. He also issued me a lifetime ban from the store.

He further and most egregiously threatened to sue me and publish my full name, number, and address on the internet if I submitted this review. When I did anyway, and after more nasty messages, he decided to take responsibility, blame pandemic stressors, and ask me to remove my truthful review. I won't because I believe he had every intent to fulfill his threats, and potential customers deserve to be warned.

Run, don't walk. There are plenty of other shops who will happily provide basic customer service.

Be careful if you still choose Levi Family. He requested a positive review multiple times before tracking showed item delivered...

Edit:

Mr. Levi's response is full of lies. He never offered to let me keep the ring after being informed it had been lost. I never said I was happy he could be out any money (in fact, the opposite was said). I never said I would be out to ruin him, just that I would be leaving a review. His wife, as I stated, was wonderful and wanted me to keep the ring should they be able to reroute it to me. Also, I would never attack someone's religion, and furthermore, we happen to be of that same religion.

There's more, but I'll stop there. I'm flabbergasted that he has chosen to lie knowing this is all documented through messaging. I know these are tough times for everyone, but that doesn't excuse treating people like they're liars for hours and then threatening them with financial, emotional, and physical harm if they tell others, which Mr. Levi did. He even sent a full apology with explanation of his stressors and requested I take my review down. I said I couldn't in good faith because I don't want anyone else to not be fully informed of how he treats people when orders become challenging.

I'm sure it was a bad couple of days and he made poor choices, and maybe that's unusual, but him lying about my actions and the truthfulness and intent of my review is just more inexcusable behavior and justification for my decision to write this review.< /Review></record>

<text>If you're looking for quality jewelry and white glove service, you MUST visit Levi Family Jewelers! I stumbled upon them accidently during my Offer Up browsing and I had a question about a Rolex posted. Bert answered quickly with a professional and knowledgeable response. Based on my simple question he was able to suggest a rolex in prestine condition that was similar. Let me tell you, I'm as PICKY as they come so I sincerely appreciated his immediate recognition in what I was looking for and the ability to find that perfect piece! They invited me to come visit, the store was easy to find, cute area in Hillcrest. Zara and Bert were ready for the challenge and made me feel extremely comfortable, they allowed me to take my time, analyze the Rolex, the diamonds, and went above and beyond to make sure it was perfect for me. I appreciated that my silly, basic Rolex questions were allowed without condescension, Bert and Zara are happy to educate and share their jewelry and watch expertise. I ended up spending a fantastic, fair price for my new watch and I can't stop smiling!!!! This is how jewelry shopping SHOULD be, they've earned a lifetime client and I highly recommend them to anyone searching for a special, attentive, experience.

I’ve shared them with Zara and both of us are pleased you’re happy with your experience. We enjoyed our visit with you and you can believe me when I tell you there are no basic questions about Rolexes I don’t love to answer. I think of fine timepieces as a celebration of time, and to me that’s important. Every minute is an opportunity to enjoy and to accomplish, to experience and to experience deeply. The opportunity to meet with you and talk with you was a gift of time and I know when you look at that Rolex on your wrist you’ll be reminded of how beautiful a gift time really is. In today’s world of deadlines and stress, it is easy to think of time as something that’s running out. In fact, sometimes we get caught up in that mindset and when that happens, we don’t enjoy the time we’ve been given. I read something a few years back that said we ought to think of time as a gift and not a threat. I thought that was beautiful. Everybody on Earth has the same twenty-four hours per day, and I’m very happy that I get to spend my time meeting wonderful people like you and sharing my love for jewelry and fine watches.

This jewelers is extremely overpriced,  the staff is extremely rude and pushy.  They also spam craigslist with watch adds breaking terms of services and do not care.  They will do anything to make an extra dollar.  Take your business elsewhere!
In response to their reply below.  Im not a seller.  Im a buyer.  Bert Levi and family ruins the buying experience for 10s of thousand of people that purchase on craigslist.  I added a picture so everyone can see that if everyone "advertised" on craigslist like this it would become completely useless.</review>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1613571932731, 'text': 'When you called our store to complain about us posting on Craigslist and when you threatened constant phone calls unless we took them down, I felt sad for you. This review makes me feel sad for you again. Thankfully, those who shop with us know the truth about us. We pay for our ads on Craigslist, and they go through a review process before they’re allowed to be posted. I understand it’s easy for you to call it spam when the visibility of a paid ad is greater than the free jewelry ads you post. I understand how you would believe the success our small business has achieved with Craisglist advertising hurts your business. Competition is tough, and when your customers choose someone else, it can be painful. However, the market for jewelry and fine timepieces is big enough for all of us. I encourage you to develop your business by providing service and commitment to quality that brings you customers who remain with you for life. It’s a more positive experience and far more likely to work than to attempt to tear down your competitors who succeed where you don’t. I encourage you to be a better person than this. You can do it, and you’ll feel far better about yourself after you do.'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410< /gmap_id></record>

Stopped by to get an appraisal on a Rolex.  Bert and his wife were very helpful and in the end we made a successful transaction.  Very fair and friendly service.  Will definitely revisit with my jewelry and real estate needs.</review>

<text>Levi Family Jewelers gave me the best experience! Bert answered all of my questions and even asked me questions to make sure I was getting exactly what I wanted. Bert and his team made sure the set was completely perfect and even adding something extra to make it more personalized! Bert communicated throughout the whole process. I purchased this online, and even though we are over 1200 miles away, the whole experience made us feel very comfortable...as if we were right there in his store. He has great pictures that identify exactly what you are getting. Several of his pieces have stories behind them. My particular set has an amazing story that makes it even more special to us! It was meant to be! 😊< /text>< rating>

< review>
My fiancé and I went here to look at engagement rings. I didn't know exactly what I wanted, so she helped me look at different styles and took her time and didn't rush me to choose, which was really nice. I did know I wanted rose gold for the band, but nothing else. Haha After taking probably about 1 hour, maybe longer, I finally knew what I wanted: Blue Sapphire in a halo of diamonds, diamonds half way down the Rose gold band. 🌹 I'm in love with it! The designer and jewelry makers are amazing! It's a small family business and I fully recommend going to them! ☺️ They really care about your experience and take the time to make sure you get what you really want. 💗< /review>

We have always done our best to make it special for someone when it comes time to buy jewelry that commemorates something as special as an engagement and we are glad you were happy with how your purchase was handled. We’re especially happy you didn’t feel rushed because a decision like the one you made deserves the time you put into it. We thought you might like to know how the elements of your ring come together from a symbolic standpoint. You probably know that diamonds represent forever, and a halo of diamonds suggests it is forever because it comes from divine decree. Blue sapphires represent protection. In fact, ancient kings used to wear them into battle. So, your gemstones together represent something that will last forever, protected by divine decree. And what is it that is protected? Well, rose gold is the precious metal of love, and fashioned into the circle that makes it a ring, it symbolizes love with no beginning or end, eternal love. We don’t believe you could’ve come up with a more beautiful meaning behind the engagement ring choices you made. Thank you again for being a customer, and congratulations to both of you!😊'}<//response><user_id>108861946786944115094</user_id>< user_name>

I recently proposed last November and with a just a little insight from my fiancé the The team at Bert Levi went above and beyond are expectations delivering a great quality ring from a family heirloom. They were able to disassemble a combine family piece into its original parts, the diamond being one of those. They polished the diamond, were very helpful in helping me understand which setting was right for my stone and delivered on a high quality final product. So Once they were done and I finished my ring box that combination made for an amazing unforgettable proposal. And Since I didn’t bring her with me they even adjusted the size for free afterwards thats great service! Highly recommended!<//text>

<text>I took 2 14kt gold diamond encrusted rings, 1 with sapphire the other with emerald.
The lady was very careless with my rings.
Would only give me an appraisal on gold value not on the diamonds.
The lady told me on the phone she could appraise the diamonds as well.
Big waste of my time.
Did I mention rude and insulting ? 😖< /text>< pictures>

I do want to apologize, however, if you were in any way made to feel uncomfortable. I know my employees and I can say with absolute confidence that none of us would ever intentionally display behavior that might be considered classist. On the contrary, I am a first-generation immigrant into this country, and we have always strived to be good neighbors, good citizens and good people to everyone around us. One of the primary goals of Bert Levi Family Jewelers is and has always been to make beautiful jewelry available to the people of San Diego regardless of a person’s financial situation. We don’t think only the wealthy are entitled to a lovely engagement ring and we don’t believe only the wealthy are entitled to jewelry. This is why we have affordable items along with our very expensive items. Whatever we did to suggest we looked down on anyone, I can promise it was unintentional and I want to apologize. As for us appearing to be uptight, that isn’t what we want to display at all. On the contrary, we want to treat everyone with warmth and kindness, like family. I apologize for leaving that impression as well. I do hope you’ll give us another chance to show the first impression doesn’t reflect how we do business. Thanks for posting your feedback, and hope you have a very nice day today.'}</Response>

My husband and I have been going to Bert Levi Family Jewelers for 18 years.  We have purchased numerous pieces of jewelry from them.  We have never considered shopping anywhere else.  Bert and Gloria Levi ALWAYS provide outstanding customer service.  They go above and beyond of what is expected.  We recently upgraded my wedding set.  I explained what I wanted and they patiently listened and kindly gave me suggestions.  As expected, they ultimately designed a gorgeous, stunning ring at an unbelievable price!  My ring is exquisite!  Thank you for everything!< /Review>

I bought my wife's engagement ring here. They were very accommodating and really helped me make a solid decision. Bert is a detail oriented and respectful man. He's a class act. They were all patient and most importantly price sensitive to my budget, and even offered me tea while we chatted.

I've taken the ring back once or twice for resizing. Never any questions or doubts, they help us every time.<//Text>

Fantastic jewelry, and great customer service.  I can't recommend this place enough! I found a great vintage engagement ring here for my now-wife. We also bought both of our wedding bands here. No sales-pressure like the chain jewelry stores. They have a great selection of new and vintage jewelry. More importantly though, their customer service is amazing. They were able to resize the engagement ring, and helped me out with a machined wedding band(cobalt) that I realized was slightly too large after wearing it for a few weeks.< /text>

<Review>Called to schedule a time to come in. I gave them a ballpark quote for another place I’m looking and was told that the diamonds I would get for that price would be awful. She told me I was being ripped off and they would never even sell such diamonds.
She has never seen the diamonds...?

Clearly, we could have been more careful about how we expressed that this time. It wasn’t too long ago, the standards were not clear in the industry. When the GIA developed the Four C’s method of analyzing diamonds, it helped the diamond industry as a whole stabilize and also set certain standards about the quality of a diamond in relation to its price. Now, decades later, jewelers trained by the Gemological Institute of America are qualified to make some quick judgements about a stone’s quality simply by the price. You can think about it as you might if someone told you they were going to get a brand new car from a dealer for five thousand dollars. You would probably be immediately skeptical. For a jeweler, some prices for diamonds are equally absurd.\nI regret that we did not communicate that more effectively with you and thus gave you a bad first impression. In our effort to protect a customer from making a decision without all of the facts, we ended up alienating you. We had the right intentions but sometimes intentions just do not translate as well as we might hope. Again, thank you for your feedback, and best of luck with your jewelry purchases.

< Review>
I would recommend Bert Levi’s to anyone, especially guys like myself who know nothing about what to get women for jewelry. I was in a pinch for an engagement ring that I liked and could afford. I figured it could be disastrous for a clueless young man to walk into a jewelry store and ask for ideas. And I only mean disastrous in terms of my bank account.

The two girls that were working were really nice and super friendly.They let me look around in peace without bugging me or pressuring me to buy something; it was really nice to just to my thing at first. The selection is startling at first in a good way because there are a lot of rings to choose from! As soon as I needed assistance one of the girls (Zara) was happy to help. She was great and didn't push me to buy something way out of my price range. I was able to buy a super fancy looking diamond ring that I knew would impress my girlfriend thus winning me some major points. And Zara offered a free warranty! That’s nuts but saved me major cash.

My lady loved the ring (of course) and there are future plans to have additional items designed here, like our wedding bands.  It’s nice knowing that I have a jewelry store I can trust, that’s one thing I didn’t think I would ever have.<//Review>

When I needed some extra cash I brought in some gold and other jewelry that I never wear and I feel like they gave me a really fair market value for the items.
I've known the family for years simply from visiting the store and they are the nicest people most honest caring compassionate and kind people. I don't believe they would ever take advantage anyone.  I highly recommend them to everyone and anyone who has ever asked me.
I've actually followed up with other people that used the jewelry store after I recommended it and they were extremely satisfied as well.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

<Text>Wow, this beautiful jewelry store is as good as it gets! Purchasing fine jewelry for years, both in California and the East Coast, I can say the experience one gets here is second to none. Don't even bother with other San Diego area jewelers, this store is the best!

First, the customer service is outstanding. Zara sold us our ring and she really knows jewelry. She even knew the size of the diamonds by eye which is a mark of superior knowledge in the diamond industry. Also, the store owners, Bert and Gloria, were excellent and made the buying experience wonderful. They give fast responses that show superior knowledge in their field.

Next, the selection is excellent. They offer vintage and new jewelry in every price range. The thing is, no matter what you spend, you will get superior quality for the amount whether it would be $100 or $10,000, the quality is there!

In the end, our ring came with the jeweler's appraisal and appraised for well more than double what we paid. This was replacement value and I know the ring would sell in a retail store for much more. I saw this ring on their Etsy shop, which I recommend viewing, and knew it was the perfect 5 year anniversary gift for my spouse. In person, the ring was even more gorgeous and we could not be more pleased!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1601929473401, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review. We are very glad Zara was able to help you with your ring purchase. There is no question that Zara is exceptional, and we are very glad to have her. Your words were very sweet, and we appreciate you sharing that you felt like we would treat a customer spending $100 just the same as someone spending $10,000. That is most certainly what we strive for, and it was nice to see Zara did it just right for you. When you leave a positive review for a small family business, you are helping a mom and pop store. Thank you again and stop by the store any time at all.'}< /resp><GmapID>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410</GmapID></record>

This place is great! Family owned and operated with great attention to detail. They made a custom engagement ring which they brought in multiple diamonds and sizes and quality to choose from. They had it made in 12 days just how I wanted it. And the final result was great my girlfriend loved it! Thank you Bert Levi Family Jewlers</review>

<Text>Absolutely the best, most familial experience I've had in a jewelry store in San Diego.  They not only fixed my six watches in record time (at a phenomenal rate!), but two different Bert Levi employees on two separate occasions took the time to discuss best practices and care for my jewelry.   These people really care, and it shows.  I HIGHLY recommend and will definitely be back.</Text>< Rating>

This was my first time visiting Bert Levi Family Jewelers and I am extremely glad that I stopped by this shop. I was trying to get ideas for engagement rings. I have always been a tomboy and I had no knowledge about ring styles. I was very pleased to have Gloria help me. She was very attentive to my needs. I enjoy there large collection of rings. It was a bit overwhelming at the same time, but in a good way. I am very happy that this shop offers customization on rings and at a reasonable price. They also have a very nice vintage selection too. I like that this shop has a theme to have unique pieces. I will definitely come back to this shop. I would recommend this shop to everyone because I receive wonderful customer service. I really appreciate the fact that Gloria took the time to explain everything to me.</Text>

<Review>I had an unexpected bill associated with my tuition for the new semester and I was totally strapped for cash. I didn't know what to do so I started looking into alternatives for quick cash flow and saw this place because they buy jewelry. I did not expect to be treated so well, and to get such an awesome deal. These people know what they're doing and really want to make the customer happy. It had a very personal vibe in the store and that made everything feel comfortable. I got the cash I needed and I loved everyone I dealt with in the store. They are all awesome.</Review>< Pictures>

Wonderful place.  Very beautiful.  I remember walking by this place once when I was in a fowl mood.  Upon seeing this magnificent shop my whole demeanor changed.  They were very willing to have me come into the store and look around and gave me some options for lay away.  When I'm ready to buy, I will definitely be back.

Owner Bert came out and was very friendly.</Review>

It was my first time selling something at a jewelry store and wasn't sure how it's going to go. The sales associate Zara greeted me and asked what I needed help with. I told her I wanted to sell my ring then she took a look at my ring and provided me with a good amount of information regarding my ring, it's value and etc. She also introduced me to her supervisor, who was also a very nice lady, very friendly and professional. They were both so sweet, it almost felt like we have known eachother for a while. I felt very comfortable about the whole process and end up selling my rings to them. The store manager provided me with her card and informed me that they are moving to the location on University Avenue. I am very pleased with the customer service they provided and my whole experience at their store. Thank you so much! Definitely going back to buy some pieces of jewelry in the future.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1601928462414, 'text': 'What a wonderful review. Thank you so much for you feedback.

Bert is a great guy who has a  outstanding jewelry selection. He is a straight forward and honest guy with great prices in all fashions of jewelry products. I highly recommend seeing his selection and purchasing any jewelry from him. Also he can perform an appraisal on your jewelry that is respected by all major insurance companies for all types of jewelry coverage like your home owners insurance or Renters insurance. I recommend anyone and everyone to shop here before buying any where else first.< /review>

I went to Bert Levis Hub Shopping Center jewelry Store as a first time buyer in the store. The parents were there that day, and what lovely people they were. I was treated as one of the family, and the mother was so splendid... i can't even put it into words. What a wonderful lady! I ended up making a purchase from Bert and he was professional in his dealings with me from the moment we shook hands. I would recommend  this store to anyone making ANY type of jewelry purchase. I will go back for more.  Kyle & Marlon<//Review>

<userid>118377697027929340624</userid><username>Thaddeus Thacker</username><Review>Before we were married my wife and I walked into Bert Levi Family Jewelers in Horton Plaza on a whim to look at rings.  We were immediately greeted by Bert with his friendly, calm and welcoming demeanor.  Bert helped us refine in our heads what we liked by tirelessly showing us a wide variety of interesting styles of engagement rings.  We were struck by how unique their selections were and it was obvious that their jewelry was not run-of-the-mill, mass produced fare.  After buying the ring that we both loved, we later had Bert and his team design and create a beautiful companion wedding band.  After we had our two girls, we went back to Bert to create a custom Mother's ring containing our four birthstones.  Aside from the fact that they have some of the most unique and stunning jewelry we have ever seen, it is the warmth, friendship and excellent service that has made us devoted, life-long customers and friends of Bert Levi Family Jewelers.  Through their genuine, caring concern to help us have the perfect jewelry, Bert and his family have endeared us to always return to them.  I could never recommend Bert Levi Family Jewelers highly enough for the quality of their amazing jewelry, their excellent service and their warm enduring friendship.< /Review>< time>

< Review>
I got a nice ring and a very nice diamond from Bert Levi family Jewelers. I looked online and I think I got a great price, too. I loved most the way I was treated. There was no pressure to buy and no pressure to make a quick decision. I think I was probably the most high maintenance customer they’ve ever had but you only get one engagement ring, right? (Stop being cynical! We’re going to last!) I could have got free customization but I loved the ring exactly as it was. Plus, I get free cleaning whenever I want. I liked the little touches, like giving me Persian Tea (which was really, really good) while I was shopping. Great place. My jeweler forever now.< /Review>

<review>This is a perfect place to sell jewelry. Don't go to some stupid pawn shop or something because they will rip you off. I had some things I wanted to sell and brought them in to be looked at. I wasn't sure I was going to sell to them or if I was just going to get some information and sell somewhere else but when I was there I decided to sell to them. I felt that they really loved jewelry and had an appreciation for it and they were very attentive to me as a customer. I am now a customer for life because of that. I am leaving this review because I think they deserve to have some attention for being a great store and loving their customers.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I went to this jewelry store today and was lured in by the beautiful window displays.  I was greeted by a friendly lady named Cecile and she assisted me with my 2 specific request.  The two different items I was looking for were a gold necklace with a surfboard pendant or a tennis bracelet with the birthstones of my family for my Mom.  She gave me some education on the different stones and assured me that she can help me design a custom order piece of jewelry and work within my budget.  It was nice to go in and feel comfortable and have a trust factor with Cecile. I will be back when I'm ready to order.</Review>

I called a few places but the lady on the phone at Levi Jewelers was nicer than everyone else so I went there first.  I did research, so I was on the lookout for some crooked things I read about like not weighing things right and stuff.  They weren’t like that at all, though.  They explained everything they did from the very beginning of when I walked in with my stuff to sell.
They weighed everything in front of me and kept notes of it all.  I had a set of earrings with emeralds that were broken, and instead of just weighing them, the lady who was helping me told me they could be fixed pretty inexpensively if I wanted.  I hadn’t worn them in so long that I wasn’t really interested in getting them fixed.  She not only bought the gold but she asked me if I wanted to keep the emeralds or if I wanted to sell them, too.  I didn’t even know I could sell them or that they wouldn’t just be taken when they paid me for the gold.
Anyway, with the emeralds I got more money that I was expecting so that was a good surprise.  I recommend them to anyone who wants to sell jewelry.  The store was also filled with people when I was there but they didn’t rush me.  Instead, I got her full attention and she made sure all the questions I had were answered.  They’re very friendly and very helpful so if you want to sell to them you won’t be disappointed.  The only bad thing was that traffic downtown was really bad that day but that’s not their fault.</Text></record>

<Review>100% pleased with my 1st visit here. I can see why they receive nothing but 5 stars continually. I traded my unwanted jewelry in not expecting much, but I came out happier with a beautiful piece (in my eyes an UPGRADE) at $0 out of my pocket. No one else was close to offering this deal. They are helpful and it feels like you're with family. I will definitely return and recommend this place. Thank you for the great service!< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

After holding onto my great grandmother’s jewelry for about a decade, I decided it was time to sell it.  I knew I would never wear any of the ultra-flashy, in my opinion gaudy, old jewelry that she left for me in her will.  I decided it would be best to sell it, so someone might actually get some use of this jewelry, or so maybe it would be used to create a new, beautiful piece.  Plus, it wouldn’t hurt to make a little extra money in selling this old jewelry.  After checking out a couple pawn shops and jewelry stores that buy jewelry, and being incredibly disappointed with the poor customer service and the terribly low prices these places were willing to pay, a friend recommended I try Bert Levi Family Jewelers.  The moment I entered this lovely establishment, I knew I had found exactly what I was looking for.  This is a family-owned-and-operated business, and it feels very homely.  The staff was very willing to help me out, and I was offered an incredible price for my old jewelry.  The transaction was very simple, and even enjoyable.  This isn’t just the place I’m going to come the next time I sell old jewelry—I’ve decided this is the only place I’m going to buy from, too!  I was so happy with the service I received; I can’t imagine going to any other jeweler ever again.</text>

I was in the store not long ago to sell some jewelry that my aunt had given me years ago and that I'd never worn. I had seen some ads for Bert Levi Family Jewelers and it seemed a good place to try. I'm really glad I did. I don't normally leave reviews but I was just so happy with the customer service and they really dealt very fairly with me. I got a nice offer and even kept one piece back to have customized. I'm a very satisfied customer and will be coming back in the future. I would recommend them to anyone.< /text>

<Name>ciara hernandez</Name><text>This is one of the best retail experiences I’ve had in my life, period. The first time I went to Levi Family Jewelers was with my fiancé when we were looking to upgrade my engagement ring, it was such an excellent experience, I decided to go again for a gift for my mother for mother’s day just recently.

I thought their selection of engagement rings was impressive, but I was thoroughly impressed by the selection of statement rings, pendants, bracelets, etc. overall, excellent. Just as before they allowed me to look at several pieces and really made sure I got exactly what I was looking for. I ended up purchasing a gorgeous heart pendant for my mom and she loved it.
Once again, the customer service and attention to detail is unparalleled! Thank you Levi Family Jewelers!</text>< time>

Every time I look at my ring... I not only feel soooo Blessed with my wonderful Husband... I also see the warmth and caring that was put into my ring by Bert & Gloria. My husband and I shopped around many jewelers when we were looking for our Wedding rings. We kept going back multiple times to Bert & Gloria... They were so inviting, had great prices,selection and they kept getting new & exciting inventory!  They listened to our needs and what we wanted and helped us create a beautiful ring!  They create a warm and inviting place, everyone in the store makes you feel right at home! Like you are family!  We have been married for years and not only do we want to go see the Levi Family, we would not trust anyone else to even clean our rings!  Bert & Gloria show genuine concern and we have complete faith that whatever the occasion or jewelry piece we are looking for... They will put their heart and soul into searching and or creating something in our preferable price range to achieve what we desire!  Thank-you so much for caring enough to put your time and patience into helping us!  Many Blessings to the Levi Family!</text>

I’ve bought a number of gifts from them, and I’ve always known they bought jewelry but I brought some old earrings that don’t fit my style anymore and a broken chain in for the first time. I really appreciated how Bert gave me the option to keep the gemstones in the earrings (two small sapphires and two small diamonds) because I didn’t know they would do anything other than just buy the gold if they weren’t going to resell them. Anyway, he gave me a fair price and gave me cash (and I blew it all on a necklace for my neice.) This is a great store. I like them a lot.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1602604852551, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the wonderful review.

My fiance and I spent a long time looking for the right engagement ring for me. We came across Bert Levi Family Jewelers and was so impressed by their service. It is a small family business but they were so warm and patient with us and we trusted them dearly! They had a gorgeous selection and helped us choose the perfect ring! It's absolutely stunning and I cannot stop marvelling at it. Thank you so much! We are so so so happy!< /Text>

<review>Bert Levi Family Jewelers are a very class act.  The pieces made by Bert are truly one-of-a-kind, and absolutely stunningly beautiful.  The staff consist of his wife, Gloria, and their assistant Zahra, both of whom are wonderful with whom to work.  Zahra was helping me first; she acquired a sense of my taste in men's jewelry from the very start.  I bought two rings, both of which are unique, and are clearly made out of the finest in precious metals.  I am seriously thinking of commissioning a few more pieces from Bert. All of the staff want to be sure that you are happy with what you purchase, and they will go the extra mile to ensure that.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.  Bravi!  By all means, stop by for a visit; you will be impressed!<//review><username>Alan St. John</username>< gmapID>

Excellent service.  I sent them my Polar HRM for a battery replacement.  Mailed it on Saturday and had it returned the following Wednesday-good as new. I was a little unhappy that I couldn't find a repair place closer to home, but with this prompt service it became a non-issue.  Very happy.<//Review>

<review>My Fiance purchased my engagement ring at Bert Levi Family Jewelers in 2011 and he just had my wedding band made from here, it is absolutely perfect! Bert and Gloria worked with my Fiance via email while he is on Deployment and made the whole process very pleasant and easy for him. We are so thankful for all the help we have received from Bert Levi Family Jewelers. We had the best experience and a wonderful outcome. My Fiance already told me he is planning on shopping here again soon! They have wonderful personal customer service and amazing timeless jewelry!</review>< Pics>

I found a unique ring that I had been looking everywhere for! Could not believe they had it. The sales associate was so nice! This was the first ring place I have ever been to where I felt like they weren't trying to sell me something. They just really wanted me to find what I loved. Excellent service. Very clean and nice. Also I really enjoyed the free candy they offer and the couches to relax on. This family owned company is fantastic and Bert is so sweet!

< Review>
I am so happy I came into this store! The rings were to die for, and the staff was even better. You can 100% tell whether or not the representatives of any store care that you are there or not and these ladies definitely helped me and actually LISTENED and CARED what I had to say. I am not familiar with jewelry and was “that customer” asking so many different questions but each question was answered with care and confidence. They made me feel so “at home” and not like an annoying person asking the same questions I am sure they hear all the time.
They have a great selection of jewelry at affordable prices and beautiful jewelry at that. If you are on the fence about visiting this store, I assure you will not be disappointed. I found multiple pieces of jewelry I absolutely fell in love with!</Review>

I was referred to Bert Levi Family Jewelers by a friend who had a great experience shopping there for engagement/wedding rings of which they have a fabulous selection. I was finally in the market for a decent watch and knew Bert had a good selection.

Many jewelers highlight the 'family'  aspect of their business but in this case it's very appropriate. The personal interest and care Bert, his wife Gloria and employees shower on their customers is truly special.

To make a long story short, Bert matched me up with a fine watch that matched my budget and included aftercare. I don't shop much but when I do I appreciate an honest, friendly merchant,  plus the Horton Plaza location was very convenient.
Thanks for a great experience!  I'm looking for Mrs. Right so may be back for that engagement ring :)<//Text>

<Text>I needed a new battery so I dropped my watch off at Bert Family Jewelers on my way to work. When I picked it up it worked fine and the price was really reasonable. Why I liked the experience, though, was that even though I wasn’t spending much at all, they offered me tea and were really pleasant and nice. I don’t know when I’ll need jewelry but this store will get the first shot at my business when I do.</Text><response>None< /response>< Time>

This is a great jeweler to go to if you want to sell gold because I went with my aunt’s engagement ring that she left me and they didn’t just pay me for the gold. They asked if they could buy it so they could sell it to customers and gave me a lot more money. I said yes but they still took the time to explain why it was worth what it was worth and why they offered what they did. I was just happy to get more than just what the gold was worth but Gloria wanted me to understand the reasons for the price and I thought that was great</review>

Bert and his staff are great. I refer my clients to them all the time. Always heard positive feedback. Friendly atmosphere with a knowledgeable staff. They go out of their way to sell you what YOU want, not what they just happen to have in stock. If they don't have it, they go out of their way to get it. Thanks Bert for treating my clients with respect!<//Review>

I hate shopping, but I love window shopping! I like going from store to store and thinking about what I'll get some day. And I do usually go back to the stores...someday.

Some stores hate window shoppers...and I get that. You don't make money today off someone looking for a product sometime in the future. Jewelry stores especially seem very touchy about buying something today. I feel a bit claustrophobic when I walk in and the attentive salespeople stare at me the entire time.

This Christmas I took my little brother downtown to buy gifts for people and left him alone for thirty minutes to get me something. What was I to do? Window shop of course! I entered Bert Levi family Jewelers because I am easily attracted to shiny things. They asked me what I wanted of course, and when I responded I was just looking around... they left me alone! It was amazing I didn't buy anything ... but someday I'll want to purchase something shiny...and I'll be sure to keep them in mind.

If you want a low pressure environment I suggest you stop on buy and look at what they have to offer.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My dad left me a number of gold coins and I finally got around to selling them.  I had enough that I was able to go to a collector and get the actual market value for the gold but once I’d sold them I started looking through old jewelry and stuff to see if I could sell that.  I found some stuff my mom used to have and a broken chain or two and also my old watch with a broken band.  I went to Bert Levi family because I had bought some repairs on my new watch from them before and I thought they did a good job. They also told me then that they buy jewelry and had some on display so I wanted to see what I could get.

They looked at everything and the only thing they wanted to buy to resell was the watch. The rest, though, they weighed and told me what they could pay me for the gold (and one silver chain.)  They didn’t just give me a number but explained everything.  Like, I had some stuff that was 14k which isn’t pure gold and some stuff that was 24k which is.  So they could pay me more for the 24k than the 14k.  They totaled it up and I thought it was fair. I took them up on that and they gave me cash but I kept the watch because they told me I might be able to use some of the parts for my new watch.

They were friendly and professional and they didn’t try to sell me on doing one thing or another. They showed me how much they could pay and explained why and treated me nicely even when Id idn’t sell the watch.  I have always liked their service and I recommend them for anyone selling jewelry, buying jewelry, or getting watches repaired. Great service and very professional people!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

When we saw it, we knew it was the one. The thing about antiques is there is only 1 available, and we were about 3 weeks away from being able to afford it. Not only did Bert work with us on the price, he let us use a layaway plan to hold it for us until we could pay it off. We paid it off on a Thursday night, and the resizer wasn't available til Monday. It was shipped out on Wednesday and the engagement ring on my hand at 6pm Thursday night! (Would have been sooner if we were home to accept the package!)</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Bert Levi Jewelers did and incredible job repairing my wife's wedding ring and it didn't take 3 weeks like many other jewelers.  They are friendly, honest and trustworthy.  I was treated like a family member. I would highly recommend their services to anyone who is looking for a certain piece of jewelry or is in need of having jewelry repaired.< /Review>

Recently, due to a lousy ex-fiance, and a broken engagement, I acquired an unwanted engagement ring.  Basically new and of substantial quality, I wanted to sell the item and receive a considerable amount worthy and close to the actual value.  After previously pawning several items at a pawn shop and dissatisfied with the outcome, I decided to sell my ring to Bert Levi Family Jewelers.  In contrast, I was very satisfied with this transaction.  The owners, in a professional environment, unlike the previous shady pawn shop, created a comfortable atmosphere in order to discuss business.  In a pressure-free environment, the owners explained how the process worked, the actual ring value, and how much I would receive through the process.  All the while, in my difficult time, the owner’s were caring and treated me as family.  You can not beat the experience and customer service of this company!  They allowed me to turn a bad situation into a profitable one!  5/5 stars!!<//Text>

<text>I was the WORST kind of customer when it was time to get an engagement ring. I changed my mind a hundred times and it’s a wonder they didn’t kick me out of the store. They were really patient, though, and there just wasn’t any time at all when it seemed like they wanted me to hurry up. When I said it, Gloria told me the most important thing was that the ring was prefect for me. We finally settled on an awesome design but it still wasn’t quite right and I was excited because they did the customization for free and kept working with me until it was exactly what I wanted. Thanks my husband he descovered this place. I LOVE Bert Levi Jewelers!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

I had such a great experience at Bert Levi Jewlery. I had custom matching rings made for my fiancé and myself. I brought in a picture of what I wanted made. It was a surprise for my fiancé and when we went to pick the rings up we were both so delighted and love our rings. Thank you so much Bert Levi Jewelry. I would definitely recommend this great family owned business.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>The store is lovely and the entire selection of engagement rings is amazing.  The beauty of the unique rings and the range in prices offered by Bert Levi Family Jewelers means that no one could go away without the ring they have been wishing for all their lives.  In fact, I fell in love with three rings and then the problem became how to choose between the three.
And then, just for fun, I looked a few of the necklaces. Wow!  Big trouble.  I wish I had the money to splurge on just a few things!  ;) Take a visit to Bert Levi Family Jewelers if you are looking for any kind of jewelry.  You won't be sorry.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Justin Wayne< /Name><text>My dad inherited a bunch of stuff from his father and split it up between my brothers and me. I got a few rings and an old rolex. Since I work with my hands, none of it really had any use for me so I decided to sell it. I tried selling on Craigslist but before I met with anyone I found out my brother got ripped off trying to sell some of my grandpa’s tools. So, I just took everything to a pawn shop but I didn’t like the price they offered. I got busy with work and forgot about it for a few months but then I wanted to pay off a credit card so I thought about it again.  Anyway, I ended up walking by the store after I went to a movie and I went in and asked about selling stuff. They wouldn’t give me any answers without seeing the stuff, which kind of ticked me off, but I went back home and got the stuff anyway.

When I came back I understood why they wouldn’t give me answers. I was thinking the rings would just be melted down but one of them was in a style that was popular again and they said they could give me more money for it. The Rolex was worth more than I thought it was but there were some things that had to be fixed that reduced the price. I think I was really sold on Levi jewelers when they told me I should try to sell the Rolex to a private party because I could get more. They recommended some websites or even checking with friends and family. I went with them anyway because I didn’t want to wait. They would have let me make more money with someone else, though, instead of just getting the money themselves.

Anyway, I don’t really buy or sell jewelry other than this time but if I do it again I think I’ll go there.< /text><rate>5<//rate><date>1490833502623< /date>< Response>

It was just a plain ring, a few chains, and a pendant. I liked the way he explained what he could offer and then let me decide. He didn’t pressure me and I don’t think he lowballed me. I also found out they have a license and I like that even though I didn’t even thik about it until I was there. I’d recommend them. Great service and fair price.<//Text>< userid>

Following a recommendation from a friend I went into Bert Levi Family Jewelers and Jewelry Buyers to find an engagement ring for my girlfriend. Not only was the selection incredible, the staff spent a tremendous amount of time with me making sure I felt comfortable with my purchase and made me a custom design from Bert & Gloria. We recently went back for our wedding bands! Not only will I continue to be a customer, I highly recommend Bert Levi Family Jewelers and Jewelry Buyers to anyone in the San Diego Area!</Review>

THESE REVIEWS ARE 1000% TRUE!!!!! I wanted to sell and buy. I have been to numerous jewelers and pawn shops but Bert Levi Family Jewelers made it very easy for me to decide. I sold an "unneeded" wedding band for a GENEROUS price and bought a REMARKABLE engagement ring for my fiance at a FABULOUS price. The hardest thing about the proposal was figuring out a master plan to match the MONSTEROUS ring! But I did it at Torrey Pines trails overlooking the ocean and SHE SAID YES! She loves to wear it and talks about it all the time. Thank you Zahra, Bert, and Gloria for an OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE!! =)))< /text>

I LOVE this place! Bert and all who work here are fabulous! I accidentally stumbled upon his shop while looking at a beautiful peridot ring in his window. The price that was given to me was very affordable and Bert was so gracious and so sincere I returned for some gorgeous earrings to match. I also had shown Bert a couple of rings that my late mother had left me and he created a one-of-a-kind necklace out of them for me which he didn't even charge for. I will never forget his kindness and I remember my mother when I do wear the piece. I must say that I have returned many times since then and I refer everyone who is looking for something special to go and see Burt, Gloria, Zahra and anyone else who also works here- the jewels are stunningly beautiful, the designs are special works of art, the staff is very caring and the prices are very affordable! After your visit here, you won't want to go anywhere else.</Text>

< review>
Okay, so romance really isn’t a strength for me. So, when I wanted to propose to my girlfriend (she’s my fiancé now) I got some advice from my sister and she’s the one who went around to different jewelry stores with me. I just wanted to go in and buy something and leave but my sister wouldn’t let me, so we went to several stores until we got to Levi Family Jewelers. If we’d gone there first, my sister would have let me get the ring there.

First off, they weren’t hard sellers.  The other places had people who seemed to jump right on us when we walked in the door. Since my sister obviously knew the right questions to ask, they kind of ignored me and talked to her. At Levi, it was nothing like that.

Instead, I was greeted in a friendly (but not, “oh, look, money is here!”) way and I don’t think they tried to sell me at all until after there was a lot of conversation—with me. They weren’t rude to my sister at all but when they found out what we wanted, they started asking me questions about my fiancé.

They asked a lot of questions and they had a lot to do with her personality before they started asking about her tastes in jewelry.  For that, I was lucky because my sister had borrowed some jewelry from her so she was able to show them right away the kind of things she liked. It was kind of amazing actually when they started showing us designs because I realized right away that some of the designs I looked at before that made no sense compared to the ones they showed me.

We ended up going with a sapphire.  Don’t think I’m cheap because I surrounded it with diamonds and my girlfriend loved that she didn’t get a diamond like anyone else. We used rose gold, which accented the red of the sapphire, and she loves her engagement ring. Also, because they did such a good job matching it to what she likes, it matches her other jewelry, at least she’s made it a point to say that a lot. I recommend this store to anyone.  Ask for Zara or Gloria if you want the ones who helped me but I think everyone there takes care of people.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>When my husband proposed to me almost elevn years ago, we didn’t have much money at all. The ring he bought me stretched his budget but it was really small and not that impressive. This year, we decided to redo the engagement ring as part of our 2ndhoneymoon. We went to Bert Levi Family Jewelers, and it was pretty great to see all of the things we could afford now. There were a bunch of designs but we talked to Gloria, and she was really helpful so I could turn my ideas into something I could see. It didn’t take long before she was showing me designs. In some ways, she seemed to understand me more than I did! I love my ring. It’s a cathedral setting with a big, beautiful diamond and smaller diamonds along the band.  I did it in platinum because we got a very nice stone that was graded high for clarity (being clear and colorless) and I wanted to show it off more. I really love my ring, and it was really nice because it made the 2nd Honeymoon seem like a real honeymoon again. They had so many designs there, so whatever kind a person wants will probably be there. When I got my ring it was perfect but even so Gloria told me that if there was anything I noticed later I could come back so she could help me. My experience was great.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I came in to Bert Levi Fine Jewelers in Horton Plaza, San Diego just to browse for "some day." A girl can dream, right? Anyways, I could tell that the staff there knew their stuff. I learned so much from them in the15 minute conversation I had with them about diamond types (my favorite were the blue diamonds…totally exquisite!). I felt totally taken care of in their knowledgable hands and price points seemed reasonable.  I was also impressed with the large selection they had and the matter-of-fact way they had it all displayed. No muss, no fuss...I appreciated that. I thought it was also great that all the refitting and facettings are done in-house. That fact gave my experience a "down home" feel to it. What’s more, I came in right before they closed and they didn’t try to rush me out of the door so they could go home. On the contrary, they were very professional and helpful every step of the way!</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><UserId.>107712523710804957937< /UserId.>< GmapID>

<Text>What an amazing jeweler. First off, this jeweler is nothing like chain jewelery stores, this place is family owned and truly dedicated to selling fine jewelery. My fiance and I went to Bert Levi to custom design my engagement ring and I was thoroughly impressed with Bert's keen eye on what cut and style ring would work for me. He truly read my mind and I couldn't be more excited with the ring we conjured up. My fiance is also thrilled because, he knows he made the right decision to bring me to Bert Levi! Another perk to purchasing my beautiful ring at Bert Levi, is that I will forever be able to get it buffed, cleaned, shined, and fitted for years to come, free of charge! Thank you to my fiance for bringing me to Bert Levi Family Jewelers, but more importantly, thank you Bert Levi Family Jewelers for making me a very happy bride to be!</Text><Response>None< /Response><user>100762744462240691545<//user><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmapID>

When my fiancé popped the question I preferred he use my grandmother’s ring.  Her ring was a round solitaire, but my fiancé surprised me by adding two decent sized side stones! He wanted to do something extra since he didn’t have to buy the ring.  Gloria suggested to him to add the stones, what a grand idea!  The ring is sentimental and after some polishing it oozes Hollywood glamour!  After purchasing the wedding bands I was able to work with Gloria on some special engraved cuff links as a wedding gift for my husband. I wanted to do something extraordinary in return to counter his surprise. We really appreciate the time the Levi’s spent with us to make our wishes come true!< /Review>

<Text>Honestly I didnt think much of getting married or getting a ring for anyone anytime soon, then I realized that it doesnt just magically all appear, so i walked into this store on an friday evening with my girlfriend in mind thinking that this could be a joke or an experience of a lifetime. I have one thing to say. Great Relationship people work here...I actually am in contact with the business in a pretty open relationship, they are flexible with me understanding that I didnt want to be pushed into buying anything at that moment but also realizing i didnt know anything about rings they pretty much walked me through it all. After I took the time I was pretty enthused about my future with the proposal and am looking forward to it... hoping the best with no expectations i think that everything is going to work out, i mean litterally between their website and the employees there in Horton Plaza I feel really comfortable with talking to them and telling them how i feel. I think my girlfriends going to like what i come up with. THANK YOU BERT LEVI FAMILY JEWELERS for taking the time to work with me> TOM< /Text>< pics>

The man (owner?) was extremely rude and tried to overcharge me for a simple watch pin that a different store owner gave to me for free.< /Text>

I very highly recommend Bert Levi Family Jewelers. I am from out of state and Bert assisted me online and he was wonderful. He made sure everything was as close to perfect as we could get it for my fiancé’s engagement ring. I will absolutely use him again if I am in need of more jewelry.<//text>

{'time': 1621798359421, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your kind review. When I started this company, I knew that we were competing against giant chain stores with big marketing budgets. I knew in order to be successful, we would have to offer better service and more personal attention if we could compete. So, I decided we would do our best to treat our customers like we would want to have a family member treated. That was more than three decades ago. When we started, I thought it was good business sense. It didn’t take me long to realize we should do it simply because it was the right thing to do. Your fiancé deserves an engagement ring that fits her personality and your relationship. It was important as I worked with you on this special item of jewelry that she got exactly what made sense, what would commemorate your love perfectly for the two of you. I’m very happy that happened. It was a great pleasure to help you with this, and I appreciate your review mentioning that we handled the whole thing online. We do a great deal of business online and I always do my best to ensure customers have the same experience as they would in our store. Again, thank you very much for the review. I hope someday we might be able to meet in person so you can enjoy some Persian tea at our showroom!😊'}<//resp>

It’s frustrating but not everyone will win over customers honorably. The harassing calls from a blocked number and constant threats have already been discussed with the authorities. It’s tough to deal with the very few bad apples anyone in business must deal with but I always take encouragement from the poem by Mother Teresa called “Do It Anyway”.\n\nHere it is:\n\n- People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered. Forgive them anyway.\n- If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. \xa0Be kind anyway.\n- If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies. \xa0Succeed anyway.\n- If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you. Be honest and sincere anyway.\n- What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight. Create anyway.\n- If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous. Be happy anyway.\n- The good you do today, will often be forgotten. Do good anyway.\n- Give the best you have, and it will never be enough. \xa0Give your best anyway.\n- In the final analysis, it is between you and God. \xa0It was never between you and them anyway”.\n\nI hope this gentleman tries to win business by attracting customers and providing them with a wonderful experience instead of tearing down other jewelers but in the end, I have to continue to do what’s right for my business and my family regardless of his bad behavior. My customers are worth it, and it’s the right thing to do😊'}< /resp></record>

I hadnt had the chance to be in the area to exchange it but today I was able to. He tried to help me as much as he could he helped me locate my purchase because I didnt have the receipt with me. He gave me a store credit and told me which set was the best. Thank you Juan 👍.</Text>< pictures>

Terrible customer service this worker went outside to check our battery and once he got done checking he goes its bad and walk back in the store. You are suppose to explain to us and offer to sell a battery not just walk away. I literally had to go back in store and get back in line when he could have easily helped us. Minding you the lines are long and slow. I always shop at auto zone but not ever again to this one.< /review>

The fat idiot with glasses couldn't find the part he said he had. After 5 minutes he gave up. I went to O'Reilly's down the street and hey had everything I needed, no problem or delay. Don't waste your time or money here.</Text>

Returned back to this store and the customer service is a joke again the workers fail to help customers who need help and pick people who simply walk up to the counter. I stood in line and they skipped me to help and charge one of their friends im so upset. This is the second time I have a horrible experience and I advise everyone to shop elsewhere for products.

Pretty bad customer service, Got to the register and the guy just starred at me without saying a thing. so then I tell him the thing I'm looking for and he cuts me off and says "what car do you have" and I'm thinking...why the hell didn't he ask me that instead of just starring at me awkwardly for 20 seconds. The rest of the interaction was pretty bad as well. It seems like they hardly know anything about the parts either

I guess they assume that everyone knows the process you have to go through and they don't put in any effort to direct the flow of the interaction at all. I think ill be sticking to O'reilly's on Pepper Ave, they are much much better at customer interaction.</text>

This Autozone store is the nearest to where I live. I am at this store spending money almost every weekend!! Sadly to say they have some of the worse customer service I've experienced. Most of the staff is not knowledgeable of the products they are selling or offering. The line at the parts counter and register are always backed up with angry costumers having to wait so long! Sometimes I try to avoid multiple trips here on one day because I know it might set me back at least an hour on the job I am working on. Sometimes employees take personal phone calls while helping costumers. The one thing I hate is when I see employees walking around on the "side-lines" seen the costumer back up they have yet they fail to give their fellow team members a hand. Not professional at all overall. Its sad because Autozone has great parts, prices, and have a highly advanced parts search engine compared to other parts stores. Yet this particular store doesn't reflect that. I feel sorry for the employees at this store that really do their job well.<//review>

There's a Hispanic man that works there(I don't remember his name)that acts like he doesn't speak or understand Spanish. He was rude towards Spanish speaking customers.

<Text>Food is spectacular a bit more than many price wise but we'll worth it when you have an extra $3 - $5 to spend. Parking lot is very large. Drive thru needs just a slight adjustment to make it easier to get in and out of the parking lot.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I've been coming to this little gem for over 20 years. Almost always get the same thing: chili cheese fries and a vanilla milkshake (made with Thrifty ice cream!)
You can count on quality and usually speed from Fantastic. Their burgers and chicken are good (according to my family) and they have a variety of other menu items to choose. I'll be back for the chili cheese fries though. 😁< /Review><rate>5</rate><username>Shayla Brown< /username>< Resp>

My food was disgusting 🤮 🤢🤮. My order was not made right. The pastrami burrito with greasy. I ask for no onions and my burrito had extra onions.  Very little meat and the pastrami meat wasn’t cooked the way I told the lady who take my order. The lady with the blonde hair needs to go find another job.... Customer service is not her specialty she had a very nasty attitude when she took my order. They French fries is old and under cook🤢🤢🤢 If I could I would give them a -0.</review>

Had the pastrami sandwich special.  Was pretty good but could have used more mustard and pickles. The French fries on one and salad on the other made a good split.< /Review>

<Review>Horrible service everybody that's works here is slow and rude and the food is over priced. I called to put in a pick up order they said 15 min I left my house after 15 min got there and still wasn't ready , they were talking laughing and doing other stuff. I couldn't wait much longer so I just got my money back.  Instead I went to golden star down the street way better food prices and better service .<//Review><user_name>gabriel cortez< /user_name>< userid>

Their avocado sandwich is great. Just get mayo instead of the thousand island spread. Everything here is great. Breakfasts are bomb. Just with anything that might have thousand island, make sure to replace with mayo. I just don't like thousand island.<//Text>

the flirtation by the female cashiers
is the best thing about this place!
the prices will have you living in your car,for 4 people you'll be spending about one week worth of groceries.

I'm being generous.  But I've gone to Fantastic for many years. They are that burger stand place you go to. But it's nice that it has inside seating and always the same consistent menu.  It's a great spot in this area.  You can call and make an order too.</Review>

Overall the food here is good, fresh and made to order. The only reason i didn't give them 5 stars is because they are a bit expensive, a hamburger special will cost you around $10! But besides that food is good, the service is great and fast! I highly recommend their chicken Kabobs!! My Armenian friend told me about em and that's all i ever order from there< /review>

The one on Santa Fe excellent. The one on Cherry very bad service I was in there for 20 minutes ask the waitress to check on mines my order to turn around give me one minute a total of 15 minutes went by next I know 20 minutes went by when back in the line ask the waitress that took my order to check my order the manager came from the back and looked at my order it was a first ticket she tapped on it I said that's okay you can refund my money which was $21 and some odd sent so I got a refund I was sitting there watching a soccer game product noticed didn't get served the way to serve all the tables that was very packed in the morning but I would not going back to the one on Cherry I don't use the word racist but I noticed I was the only black American in there after the fact what made it so hurting is I used to go to that one a lot also I stay on Willow and Long Beach Boulevard in Long Beach.< /review>

< Review>
I come here a lot but after today will be my last I had four cars in front of me when I ordered sitting in the car for about 10-15 minutes before I finally got to the window which is not unusual and I don't have a problem with that when I got to the window she attempted to hand me something and said here's your two burgers and I said what I did not order burgers what did you order I ordered two breakfast burritos with bacon I'm sorry give me a second I said sure roughly for two breakfast burritos what really pissed me off though wasn't all that it was more of the girls attitude when she came out and handed my burrito I did not do nothing wrong therefore I'm not coming back to this place and I recommend to anybody else reading this be careful I would not order food from this establishment.  Now the one on Cherry that place is okay but the one Santa Fe they suck...< /Review>

I live in the area, and it's a food desert of sorts, so I only frequent this place just for being down the street from my home.

There's like a 50% chance you're going to get a stale bun.

Tried their burgers, their tacos, and spicy chicken sandwich.  Meh...

I mostly get just their fries as a snack, and their seasoning is frequently good.  However, they're overall a bit inconsistent< /Text>

<Review>Good is good. Unfortunately, for the passed 2 months their customer service hasn't been so good. We order food in advance and sil need to wait 45mns for a cold soup. Lately, they been getting the orders wrong and taking quite some time extra to give you the food. Customer service is a better in the mornings.</Review><date>1560635819670<//date>< user>

<text>I'm a huge burger fan as well as good customer service. This place does it big & right! Fast paced, large filling portions & the price is right. Go to any other restaurant & they charge $15-20 for a tiny burger that your not even filled up on,  not this place! Amazing Home style cooked burgers! I gotta come back for a breakfast burrito! Defiantly recommend this spot :)< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dd347c9e86b1f7:0x6f8b5372d5a8ef00</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This has always been the best place for burgers, chili cheese fries, burritos (especially breakfast burritos) and i personally love the fried mushrooms. I never mind a little wait for great food, if my food comes too quick i get suspicious.  Whenever i visit Long Beach i make sure to stop by for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Please come to Phoenix and shut these so called burger joints down!!< /review>< pictures>

This is my on the go stop to eat or pick up. 95% pick up. The food is always fresh. I do the chicken salad here a lot. Also, the sandwiches are great. It gets crowded so have time or phone in a pick up.<//text>

The service is okay they can act a bit careless sometimes. But the last time I came to this spot the OJ tasted weird and they took about half an hour with our order. Not to mention the food was cold I just hope they do better next time because I like coming to this spot.< /review>

They mest up my order. My drinks where not correct at all. And I see that they don’t have hair nets and their was a hair in my fries. It was a unpleasant dining and will not come back to that specific place. And the worker Diana mest up the order again after I told her what was wrong with, she can’t get any right. SMH Diana.</text>

The best burger spot on the Westside! My fave chili cheese fries in the city....you might have a little wait at peak times, but it's always worth it. anything you're in the mood to eat, they have it. The food is always fresh, always more than enough, and always piping hot. Check them out!< /review>

NO BUENO!,  bacon breakfast burrito and med.  coffee cost me $11.25 and she kept my change as a tip?  she also put sugar in coffee and didnt ask or ever do that, also put chili in burrito and it ruined the taste, got it all over fingers trying to salvage food but ended up throwing it away, there gotts to be a better place near by?< /review>

It shouldn't be that hard to add ketchup to a burger. I asked for ketchup and they poured the whole bottle of ketchup on the burger. Isn't that nice!!!! I would give them 0 stars if I could.</Review>

I paid  $7.49 for a hamburger special I don't mind paying this but, the portion of the fries where in a small tray enough to fit in the palm of your hand in the past I got a good portion. My burger was cold in the past shredded lettuce was used this time it was a thick slice of lettuce no tomato no onion. If wasn't really hungry I would have complained. I don't recommend ordering this its over priced for what you get.<//review>

<Review>For some reason they always take long when I come to this location. I got here and it was not busy at all. I had to wait over 30 minutes for my food to be served. And I ordered a large lemonade and they gave me a small cup. Will never come to this location again.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I am not satisfied with the staff and the customer service is poor. It was my first time to this cafe and the staff was rude, and unprofessional.

Would not reccommend this cafe to anyone.</review>

Today in the morning at 7:45am I took my son to buy him breakfast. This girl on the register was picking her nose and I told her that is not cool and even my son seen her doing it. She replied that she did not care and I told her I don't  want the food anymore and then she said ok whatever I have more customers waiting in drive thru. I can't believe this! I loved the food so much now idk if i ever will go back. I hope this helps.. 😏< /Review>

<Review>The food here used to be good. 5 years ago the burger combo were for 4.90 now its like 7 dollars. The burgers seem a bit cold and a bit more half assed. As for the people complaining about the service they're childish. Mistakes happen (typical rude people). Overall they've never made a mistake on a order I've made. Its just the food has become overpriced and the burgers aren't as good as they were before. They are not cooked well and the lettuce is thrown in half assed.< /Review>< resp>

They are no competition against those huge companies. Eat at local restaurant instead. You won't regret it.< /Review>

<review>Food is ok. My favs are chilli cheese fries & carne asada quesadilla (yummy but extremely unhealthy), but I think their menu is over priced. Fast food drive-thru with Diner prices - $15 to $20 for a one person, meal and drink.</review>< time>

<text>I used to live within five minutes walking distance of this location. ALWAYS received great service. On occasion would receive complimentary dipping sauce. The item on their menu that is to die for and always kept me coming back is the Chicken salad with ranch. It is good for the price since you receive a ton of chicken and cheese. The best chicken salad I have ever tasted. I have had my friends, bf and cousins try it. My cousin lives in Lynwood ang goes there for the salad. I used to work in downtown lb and my bf would call me to get him that salad omw home.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Arrived at 11:55, lights on, full staff and the MC’s just shut down the lights. Flipped them off omw out.

Idk the hours of operation- but saw theH were opened. Lazy people. Lost my business. Could have had the courtesy to say sorry we just closed. Rem though hrs are til midnight- I would understand - I worked drive thru before- and nowadays so many places open late. Either close at correc time or change the hours. No one asked them to work there and that shift. Trust me- it isn’t that serious, but I am a troll!<//review>

quality out does quantity.  this isn't mc-Ds fast service but it's a good place to slow your day down for some decent food. carne asada tacos and pastrami sandwiches are the best in 10 mile radius.</Text>

The omelettes are the business but they hella charge a lot for adding alvocado like 2 dollars. They charge extra for ketchup as well, so if u want more than 3-4 ketchups expect to be told that will be extra. Im not big on ketchup but being pregnant is a different story. Other than that, food is good.< /Text>
