Made my first modification purchase for a new SUV from Auto Talent and they did not disappoint. Their pricing was the best across competitors and customer service was excellent. My product arrived on time and fits perfectly. Will be buying again!<//review>

We tried to buy a set of wheels. They charged us over $2,000, and we have NOTHING to show for it. We canceled the order and asked for a refund and got nothing. Now when we call we only get voice-mail, but never a return call. We keep getting ignored or given the run around. Our next step is small claims court to get our money back.

Update: After 20 min of making a stink about it we got an email about our refund. Hmmm. Curious. I will update if we actually see the funds.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cab26c8decfb:0x9d23eeffc5a0ae4f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<rating>1<//rating><Text>I ordered a spoiler. They sent me a spoiler that was damaged in the mail so it didn’t fit my car. It took me weeks to talk to someone that “takes care of returns” in those weeks waiting to hear from that person I exceeded the return time frame. Now they will not refund the product. Do not shop here. Go to IND distribution! They are way better and customer service the best.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2cab26c8decfb:0x9d23eeffc5a0ae4f<//gmap_id><Date>1628080714018< /Date>< name>

<review>Requested to cancel order before it was shipped. Received email confirmation that my request is received. They still shipped the product and charged my card. Now I am in process of trying to stop the package from arriving to me and returned back to sender.

I am trying to handle this myself. No representative I have spoken to thus far has been of any help and refuses to respond in timely fashion. I have email logs and dates proving my request was received prior to shipment. There was more than enough time for the item to be canceled.

This is the worse shopping experience I have ever had and creates the biggest ******* headache

Update: I finally got a hold of them and I was told it’d receive a follow up as well as an email stating I’d be receiving the refund as long I prove with a bank document stating I never received money. I provided that 3 weeks later no follow up.

Seriously don’t buy from these cons I don’t care what those good reviews say what these guys did is beyond ****ed.

I even have proof if anyone that reads this review and is curious drop a comment and I’ll share photos with my personal information redacted.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2cab26c8decfb:0x9d23eeffc5a0ae4f< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Fast shipping and good follow up. The part (Carbon fiber grill) fit PERFECTLY and was the best price I could find!! I have my eye on a few other parts but have some other things I need to do first. But when the time comes, Auto Talent is going to be the first place I look. And judging from my first order, I probably won't even need to look elsewhere. Great job!!!<//Text>< Time>

<Text>Stop shopping. If you want great service and awesome prices Auto Talent is the place. Golan has been awesome consulting with me. I am a first time supercar owner (so clueless and ripe for being taken advantage of) but he is honest and gives advice like "if I were you, this is what I would do" even if that advice doesn't benefit him directly. He's literally saved me thousands of dollars in wasteful spending proposed by other unscrupulous dealers. If you want expert advice, fair (if not great!) prices, then Golan and Auto Talent is the place to buy from.</Text><userid>105931791945743964929<//userid><rate>5</rate>< date>

Kept getting emails from them to write a review, so here I am doing so. Email responses were quick from Golan prior to placing my order. Once placed, replies were slow and a few I never got replies from. Order was weeks behind schedule, supply shortage, fine... I get it. But the issue is updates were never provided proactively, I always had to email and ask. Eventually got a shipped notification saying shipping label was created, sat for a week, no update to the tracking number. Finally I decided to email them and see what's going on, magically the order gets dropped off the same day, but not a single reply acknowledging they had forgotten about it, not surprised. The order did eventually arrive, hence the two stars. But customer service definitely does not feel like a priority for them.<//Text>

<Text>Paid for wheels that never got shipped.  Refused to answer emails or return phone calls.  They were quick to take my money, but when I called and emailed them questions about the order, they didn't respond because they knew what they ordered wasn't what I ordered.  With service like that, I don't see how they stay afloat in this tumultuous sea of service-oriented businesses.  They were quick to refund my money though when I demanded it, after being ghosted for 2 weeks, and for that I award them one shiny gold star.</Text>< Pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I ordered through them lower down pipes and they never sent me a confirmation email or anything on my order I tried to contact them several time for any confirmation and no response. On my fourth business day trying to get in contact with them I finally get through to someone who doesn’t work for them but sends automated emails to the owner In order to get a response. Once I finally get a call back they tell me my part is out of stock and is it okay for me to wait for October 15 to ship. They should not sell parts out of stock on their website and on top of that have it on sell basically advertising it. Now I have to push off plans of installation and lose my deposit due to their unprofessionalism. I hope my review can help other people before purchasing.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

When purchasing KW V3 coilovers for my M235i, Auto Talent was a no-brainer. They offered the best price and provided friendly support over the phone during the install. Would recommend, and plan to purchase from them again!</Review>

My 2016 Audi S6 fell prey to the infamous turbo oil screen clog......Rather than pay $12k to replace the stock turbo's, I chose to upgrade to RS7 Turbos with billet compressor wheels and remove the oil screens entirely.  Since the shop is already tearing into the car, it made sense to upgrade the down pipes as well.

This is where Auto Talent comes in, most places list non-catted down pipes and when I could find down pipes with cats, they were back ordered.  Auto Talent had the down pipes I wanted (with catalytic converters) in stock and shipped within 1 business day of my ordering them.   Thank You!  I should also mention that the DP's are absolutely beautiful. :D Still waiting on the turbo's from another vender, so I can't yet say how they sound, but I'm betting they will be awesome.< /Text>

< Review>
First time buying from Auto Talent, Jacelle attended me personally (purchased online), and they followed through text message. They double checked my order was correct, gave me ETA and tracking number as soon as they had it.
Honestly this is one of the best online purchases I experience, the attention to the customer is amazing its as if I was buying in person. My AMS downpipes came in in perfect conditions and everything was well packaged. Definitely checking their site firzt before buying elsewhere.
Auto Talent, you won yourself a customer 🙏.< /Review>

Shouts out to Golan and the rest of the team here at AutoTalent. Quick responses from the staff, quick shipping and great customer service. Hard to find all three! Not to mention they usually have the best prices online.<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>This place is a scam for ordering parts online. I can’t speak for there automotive shop in person. But they will take your money instantly and then never send out your car part. I’ve been trying to reach someone named Golan who I guess is in charge here and there has been zero communication from him. I’ve placed my order in February 24th and a month later absolutely zero communication. Save your money and time and just order from a more reputable shop!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2cab26c8decfb:0x9d23eeffc5a0ae4f< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have been working with Golan for over 10 years. He is a true gentleman. Not only does he give you the best service, but the BEST advice. If it wasn't for him, I would be stranded on the side of the freeway with no transmission. I contacted Auto Talent when I was traveling to Phoenix, Arizona from Los Angeles. My car broke down and I was stranded. I searched on Yelp and found Auto Talent. When I called I was greeted by someone named Golan. He understood my situation and offered to help. GOLAN is a scientist of motor vehicles. If you tell him what you need or what problem you have it will be diagnosed and solved within minutes of speaking to him: Thank you so much!!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2cab26c8decfb:0x9d23eeffc5a0ae4f< /gmapID></record>

I placed an order with Auto Talent for 2 items but had to remove one of the items the next day, still BEFORE order was shipped. They said they will charge me 5% restocking fee on the entire order no matter what. I asked to cancel the order in that case, so I could order elsewhere, but they STILL shipped it despite all previous communication! I refused the package and it has been 7 days since they received it back. I still didn't get my money and no follow up from them, nothing. What a thief company! Totally unprofessional. Stay away from them.< /Review>

Hit up AutoTalent for an FI Exhaust for my F85 X5M and got put in contact with Golan. He answered all of my questions, even the "dumb" ones some of us are embarrassed to ask. Golan was super helpful and talked me out of another mod I was going to purchase and explained why. Spent less than I anticipated and could not be happier.<//Text>

Worst service I have ever experienced. Ordered an exhaust during their Black Friday sale. Promised to ship exhaust and send tracking number several times yet never followed through. Paid them $5,000 to get dodged and ghosted for over a month. Buyer beware.<//text>

I ordered a Dinan intake from this third party company ( AutoTalent) , which I paid $1,200 with Affirm , back in October. I have emailed them as soon as it has been a few weeks since I ordered the intake. They reached out to me giving me different dates after having back to back emails with them. I then told them to cancel my order specifically saying " I don't want it anymore ". They have never replied to my emails ever again nor have answered my phone calls I have made to them . I have called Dinan ( the company that AutoTalent gets the intake from) , and the representative told me that the order was cancelled since December 3rd. Now I am paying Affirm for something I have never received. Affirm can't even refund my money unless AutoTalent gives the money back to Affirm.<//text>

<Date>1609983194078</Date><Rate>2</Rate><review>Ordered a copy of BM3 back in November (11/29), got an email that week saying that my order is in the process of being fulfilled (weird I thought that bootmod3 was instant delivery and I just needed a software key), and so I was patient and waited it out. 12/16 I try to call the company, nothing. I email the company and get a response the next day with my code, great! Now I just need the free wire that was promised with my order! Golan emails me back and says that I should have received my obd2 to ethernet cable by now, but I let him know that I haven't received one. He asks if I want the cable sent or a refund for the cost of a cable, and so I ask him just to ship one out to me like we originally agreed upon. 12/18 tracking info is sent out and I got notified that the package is on the way. It's now 1/6 and my item is still at their shop.. the package hasn't moved since the 18th of December. After receiving only one email a day I gave up trying to contact the company and just order my own off Amazon.

Tldr; will never order anything from these guys again. Lackluster customer service with horrible availability and response times. Order placed on 11/29 and still have not received the full product as of 1/6.. Keep your wire.

Update: Golan reached back out to send another cable. Respect on his end for that much.<//review>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><text>After 15 years of ownership I finally wanted to do some engine and suspension tweaking. I messed autotalent on bimmerpost.com and that’s where I met Golan. He was very helpful and answered all of my questions. He presented me with a few different air intake options and I went by his recommendation. The eventuri intake shipped very fast and is a beautiful intake. Once installed it woke up my car with sound and performance.

I placed another order again after I explained to Golan that I had some body roll in my suspension. He recommended that I go with sway bars and I ordered a set for the front and rear.  I just installed them and I notice a difference already.

Thank you to Autotalent for the friendly and quick service and thanks to Golan for all of his help.<//text><Time>1607752130865</Time><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

I ordered a new carbon diffuser first week of December came in damaged which has held my car up from being finished for 3 weeks so I reached out to the manufacturer which responded same hour but Autotalent can’t even respond after a month. I would take your business elsewhere.< /Text>

I said I’d keep the order and was then told it’ll get to me in roughly five days. Fine. On the 24th I was told my order was processed and they’d send me tracking as soon as possible. Crickets  until June 29th and I had to email them asking what was going on. It goes silent again until July 1st, and I’m informed they’re now back ordered until 7/7. Shocker. When I ask for a refund I’m told they have to check to make sure it wasn’t shipped before they can do that. Then I’m told they have it in stock and will ship Monday/Tuesday (7/6-7/7) again, nothing. Now, on Monday (7/20) I’m told it’s being shipped out that day or the next. I haven’t heard a thing. I’ve ordered directly through the company the intercooler is coming from (VRSF) and have had my orders come in within a few days. This is just baffling to me, that I keep being told different things, for what seems like them not wanting to lose a sale. This isn’t a $20 dollar part that’s being help up, it’s $400 dollars. Don’t order anything from these people. Take your money else where.

I’d also like to mention, the response time is horrendous, I have to keep emailing to get responses and they have to keep “contacting VRSF”, which it doesn’t seem like they’re the problem. When I ask for a refund it’s always the same thing “I have to contact them to make sure it wasn’t shipped”. Like what?? You keep telling me it’s backordered and not in stock, how would it ship??

*UPDATE*
My order was being handled by Matt. After posting my review, Golan, decided it would be a lovely idea to send me a nasty email telling me my review was “completely ridiculous” and that I “just can’t seem to understand” that my problem is not with AutoTalent, but with VRSF. I’m not sure if Golan is some kind of manager, or what. But if I were to ever send such a nasty email to a customer, as an employee of a business, I would be fired. Golan needs some training on how to handle disgruntled customers, and it’s been made quite apparent this person has not the slightest clue on how to deal with people. Unprofessional and childish behavior. Someone should give this guy a lesson on how to be a proper businessman and teach him some proper people skills. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!< /review>< username>

They keep telling me we have to hear back from the manufacturer? Why? The manufacturer didn't mislabel it - you did. Keep in mind, it was $110 trim piece. If their customer service is this bad for that small of a part, I wonder how it is for more expensive parts.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The worst customer service experience i’ve ever had. Can’t reach anyone on the phone and made the whole process much harder than it had to be. I ordered a part that said it would fit my exact car; make, model, and year. Only for me to find out when my mechanic has my car all taken apart that it doesn’t fit. I’m then told “I ordered the wrong part” after triple checking the compatibility of the part to my car.

I was then told I would have to pay for the shipping to return it even though they messed up the order. Communication from this company was terrible and this whole process stretched out for over a week, even though my car was taken apart for the install.

Golan was the worst person to talk to, made me never want to order from this company ever again. Seemed to look for any chance to insult me that he could making this process even more frustrating.

I ended up disputing the charge on my credit card in hopes to get the money back and get the part from a reliable company. (Which I did Kies Motorsports is by far the best company I've ever worked with) The credit card company didn't process the dispute and then I received an email from Golan again now months after the initial transaction to "gloat" this was just childish and not professional at all. Im not sure why this guy works in customer service when he has no self control in a work or professional environment.

See screenshot below! By far the WORST company I have ever order anything from in my life. Don't waste you time or money here</Text>

They were all very professional and went above and beyond in helping me out with my decision.  Golan was great and very personable to work with.  The team at Auto talent know their stuff and have very reasonable prices. Thank you Golan, Sam and Justin!< /Review>< user>

This is my third time ordering from them and I’m located in south Florida. Their customer service is a million times better then any local shop in south Florida that why I’ll keep ordering from them. They always sell genuine parts, offer fast, free and secure shipping and best of all their prices are better then anyone else’s. My rep was Golan and he was beyond awesome! I can say that they stand behind their business 100%. Do not hesitate if you’re thinking about rendering their services you won’t be disappointed!< /text>

They are non responsive. I tried to get in touch with them every which way, nothing.  I regret ordering a part from this company.

Golan at Auto talent, was extremely helpful with picking out an exhaust for my f82 M4. He took the time to express to me which ones he likes personally, which ones too loud and/or raspy. Was never pushy about any particular exhaust and gave me the best price.<//Review>

Let me just say there is not a lot of legit shops that can work on German vehicles and have amazing results. My story starts with my engine blowing on my e90 m3 due to rod bearing issues.then my car went to several of shops including one in the valley that starts with the letter G and those guys totally just left my car I did not work on it because the previous shop completely try to disassemble the engine and messed with the arrangement of all the parts off the car or at least that was what they claimed and when I got the car back there are some parts that were swapped total nightmare. Long story short autotalent check the car in and broke the engine down piece by piece I'm talking to the little most tiniest parts.they were able to completely reassemble my tire engine build and machine what was necessary like it was not even a challenge.
With that a question this shop stands out above all those other shops that can only manage to put on superchargers ,exhaust, brakes and suspension. The staff was super professional, understanding of my situation and super helpful in every possible way I can imagine. There is a reason why everybody comes there whether it's a Lamborghini Aventador or a BMW m3. I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever go anywhere else and you can take that to the bank. Thank you Auto Talent for the best experience.< /Review>

Unbelievable service, such a treasure.  George handles his people and his customers with ease, grace and humor.  I always come away from MBZ knowing I can trust the results.  Not many mechanics like these guys!

The Very Best autorepair shop for your MBZ. I've been going here for years, the service is impeccable, there is no extra over pricing ever.  I even bought another MBZ from the owner George. You can't find a better establishment.< /Review>

<text>This place is always on point. The staff are efficient, professional, and reasonable as far as pricing and the actual work that needs to be done. This place is busy, but that's because they provide excellent service and have a lot of returning customers. It's definitely worth the wait. Great work Mbz Motors.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

The auto detective knew what they were up to and ordered them to pull out all employee papers knowing there was illegal activity going on. They released my car with no charge. ALL of the employees gave me and my wife a filthy look as if they were caught and exposed.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
George has been fixing my cars for 12 years and I can't say enough good things about him and his staff. He kept my car running while I was in school and provided a ride to school, or a ride home. He dropped his cost of oil change to reflect the drop in national cost of oil. Who does that?! George. Quality service. And he knows his customers well; notices when I'm not feeling well and tells me not to worry and get well. He's not cheap, but he is reasonable and you can be damned sure he's going to fix the problem and a few others that he may not even tell you about.  Love him dearly.</review>

I've been a loyal customer for 7 years. Even after moving to the Bay Area, I try to schedule my maintenance and repairs during trips to see family and friends in LA.  An honest mechanic is hard to find.  George is a keeper.< /Text>

One of the Best Mercedes Shop in town, don’t be surprise if you find no space because everyone want a touch from George.. The quality of service is incomparable for the price on a MB... I’ve been going to this place for 4 years, I never been disappointed with the quality of the service or the price. MBZ Motors, thank a lot for your service.< /Text>

My S550 had a clunking sound when driving over small imperfections on the road and it was bugging me for months. My brother in law referred me to MBZ and boy was I thankful. George was patient with me and took his time to figure out the cause of the clunking. It’s was my left air strut. After this was replaced my car rides as smooth as butter. Also his pricing is extremely reasonable. My Benz will only be serviced by George moving forward. Thanks again George for taking the time and finding the root of my cars issue.</review>

Mbz Motors does excellent work and very reasonable prices. Very customer service centric. Their prices are a fraction of the dealer's. A month ago I had to have my car towed to the dealer. A censor had gone bad. The dealer was going to charge $960. Mbz charged $380.</Review>

<text>If you have a Mercedes and live in the area - this is the place to go. I can barely get them to charge me anything. My tank cap was stuck, then a lightbulb needed to be replaced, but George just waves you off. When I had more costly repairs, I was charged, but much less than I expected - I am going nowhere else with my MBs (2001 SLK, 2014 CLA, 2007 GL) try them and judge for yourself.<//text><Resp>None</Resp>< pics>

<review>I' am officially so impress by this company.
about 6-7 months ago they fix  brakes on my wife's  E-class. yesterday  you could hear a very loud noise coming from the brakes.,so my wife took  back the car  this morning not only they fix my brakes , they also replace a xenon  light that was busted.. basically they had a mechanic working on my Benz for over 1 hour and 30 minutes..

wonder how much did I end up paying? ZERO-NOTHING-NIET-NADA! you guys are pure awesomeness, classy place, classy people, and extremely professional way more professional & friendly then the MZB of encino !

i will always go back to this place for getting any kind of  service done to my automobiles<//review>< name>

<text>George always looks out for me when I take my car in. Usually lets me know exactly what's going on with my car and what I need to do to fix a part etc. I've been taking my Mercedes to him since I bought the car and he makes sure to keep it running.< /text>< user_id>

It was often so full in between me checking it that my own mail stopped coming into the box and I had to wait in the ridiculously long line to pick up what wouldn't fit. I spoke with at least six different people requesting that this be remedied. I tried with a friendly plea and I tried with indignation. No approach was affective with their staff. If I hadn't printed business materials with this box, I would cancel it and go elsewhere.

They delivered a package to the wrong address and refused to rectify the situation. When I called asking about the package's whereabouts they sent me to two other buildings nearby, claiming the carrier mistakenly dropped my package off at each one. It wasn't at either location. I called back the next day and the customer service representative again told me that the package was delivered to the building next door. It wasn't. Nor should it have been, given that all parcels sent to my complex are to be delivered to the lobby of my building. And in fact the tracking says it was dropped off in the wrong zip code. Every time I call I get a different story from the same person about where, how, and why it was dropped off, all with the same ending: we delivered it correctly and someone in the building must have taken it. Utterly incompetent.<//Text>

They refuse to go upstairs to deliver packages which require a signature.  Apparently they do not want to be bothered to use the call box either. If they don't want to do their job, I suggest they find another line of work!</Text>

<text>I had a foul experience here where a petite Asian lady who works at the location yelled at me for not knowing not come in without waiting in line I apologized profusely for not seeing the sign and she still continued to yell at me. I explained I only needed an overnight packing slip and continued to apologize but she was relentless I feel because I was apologizing it almost made her get more upset. I felt bullied and publicly humilated. Just wrong I am still upset it wasnt right.< /text><Time>1612985730574</Time><user_id>118379229872240591255<//user_id>< rate>

If you are going to consistently lock the lobby drop box, you should at least post a sign to explain when and why it is closed. 7 people with packages worked to buy postage from the automated kiosk, only to not be able to drop their packages. How hard is minimal customer service?<//Review>

The old woman in the tracking service center is so rude, I waited for a long time but she just played her phone and ignored me.   Excuse me?  So I told her I have a question because my package already arrived at the post office last month but no more information after that.  She even didn’t ask me the track number and just let me to wait.  I don’t know why usps has this kind of employee, so stupid.</Review>

While waiting in a long line, I just saw Betty deal with not one, not two, but THREE bad customers in a row. They blamed her for things that were completely out of her control, like the USPS shipping durations and rates, and post that requires signatures. Just standard USPS policy stuff. I felt bad for her as she dealt with immature temper tantrums from grown men. They tried to argue with her but Betty stayed calm, kind, informative and professional the whole time, even offering alternative solutions to their problems—the customers took their frustrations out on her anyway. I admired her professionalism because I would have walked away from that job. I hope that treatment is not the norm for her, but I think she’s truly a great worker at the post office. Betty deserves the best! Give that woman a raise 🙌🏻</Text>

<Review>Tried to send out 100 priority mail envelopes with signatures for our business. The USPS staff was too lazy to do it. Told me they will only process 10, and told me to use the self service machine (which is not automated, and requires addresses to be entered manually unlike when the staff does it directly). I cant enter 90 addresses at the self service machine. They were literally just too lazy to process the envelopes, and dont care at all about the roughly $1,000 I would have spent there. Its unbelievable how lazy they are.</Review>< user_name>

I live closer to the post office on Colorado but I choose to use the one in Lincoln because the people are really really nice.
If you're here to pick up stuff though be prepared to wait a pretty long time just to get to your turn.</Review>

The area to access the post office boxes was open 24 hours in the past. I previously had given two stars since no hours were posted and I wasn't able to get anyone at the post office to respond. I ended up submitting a complaint through the USPS website and did receive a response in a timely manner. Apparently due to vandalism they restricted hours and were unaware hours weren't posted. They posted them within two days which is much appreciated. Also, the lock boxes for picking up items too large for the box is a much appreciated addition since it meant not having to wait in line.<//review>

The staff and manager were super friendly when things go well, but as soon as something doesn't go smoothly (USPS failed to deliver mail), they (the manager) just try to get rid of you without even trying to fix it. They make you wait, just to tell you they cannot do anything. Then they avoid the counter, and other customers have to wait as well. Even if they cannot fix the problem, they should have stayed professional.</text>

Open later than most Post Offices. Parking is often difficult. Staff can be helpful or not, depending on the day. Big post office box lobby. Self-service weighing, postage machines and mailing supplies is useful when they work and are stocked adequately. Lines at the counter can be very long so get organized before you get to the counter while waiting in line..< /text>

<review>As a small business I like this post office better than I do the other post offices in Pasadena, because there are more counter staff, they have a self-serve area, they have a large package bin drop area behind the counter and a large package drop slot. They also have longer counter hours.
I am able to walk in and out with my prepaid packages in under 3 minutes; that is very important for small business customers who ship daily.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>0 stars if I could give it. Terrible terrible. They never take your call. Online tracking says my certified mail has a deliver attempt last Saturday and will be redelivered the next business day. We never received a note or anything about the first attempt, and the second delivery never happened. Been calling them over and over all goes to its stupid automatic voice system that helps nothing but waste you 1 minute 30 seconds. How could you make such simple post delivery system so messy and inefficient? Worst ever.< /review>< time>

I used to be able to access the lobby around the clock.  That way, I could avoid the crowds and mail a package at midnight.  Now, since some time in early 2016; the doors are locked at night.  No explanation, no hours posted.  I'm attempting to call now in order to get an explanation, but no one picks up the telephone.  --Second attempt; still just a ringing telephone; no pickup.< /review>

This is the worst post office! Our mail mail only delivers when he wants.   I've mailed letters to myself from work and it took 3 weeks...3 weeks!   I've gone to pick up my mail... and they're annoyed by me... managers do nothing!  I've installed videos to prove mail man walks right by our house.... it's just disgusting!  Calling to complain on phone over 3 hour hold... I just forward everything to a p.o box at post office on Colorado...an employee stated they get a lot of complaints regarding that post office... seriously get it together😪</review>

<Review>1 star is too many. Tracking indicated a "missed notice" was left. No notice to be found when I got home. Since no one was going to be home all week to sign for the package, I went online and requested it to be held at the facility. I go the next day to pick it up, and it's out for flipping delivery! These incompetent fools. Idiot at will call said the sheets just print out with redeliver on it regardless of anything and it may or may not be there tomorrow for pickup. I'm absolutely livid. Their incompetence is now going to delay me being able to get my package by 4 days.</Review>< pics>

<text>GARBAGE CUSTOMER  SERVICE WORKERS WHO ARE LIARS. Would give ZERO stars if I could. I had a college application deadline yesterday and had paid alot of extra money for my official transcripts to arrive in time for my deadline. I knew my official transcripts would be in the mail Friday morning(yesterday) but the deadline is Friday by noon. So I put a hold on my mail so my carrier wouldn't take it on his route for the day because my carrier doesn't drop off my mail at my house u til 4:30 pm which is obviously WAY AFTER my deadline. I go into the post office the second they open so I can retrieve my held mail for the day. My carrier decided to take my mail for the day on his route to deliver to my house anyways even though the hold on my mail had been processed. By the way, I was going to cancel the hold once I found out my mail was there since I know you cannot pick up mail while it is on a hold. So I tell one of the worker's at the window they need to contact him to get my mail back, they say they can't give out his route..? I didn't ask for his route, I asked you guys to conga t him to bring my mail back to the post office since he messed up and took it anyways. The supervisor claimed he would try to Contact the carrier. Supervisor called me 20 minutes later and said that the carrier would come back to the post office to drop off my mail very soon so I should wait around at the post office until he drops off the mail. I go back up to the window 20 minutes later and ask if the mail had been dropped off yet and of course the supervisor is nowhere to be found so I ask a regular employee if they can check if my mail has arrived from the carrier and he informed me that his supervisor said that my official transcripts weren't in my mail stack for the day and that he never said he was going to bring it back to the post office for me, but instead deliver the mail to my house ay the normal drop off time of 4:30pm. WHY THE LIES?? So I went to the college to drop off my application packet without my official transcripts which is going to most likely be thrown right in the trash because official transcripts are required for the application. And guess what!? When I got my mail that evening, my official transcripts that the supervisor and mail carrier said weren't part of the stack of mail for the day, we're magically in the stack of mail for the day, HMMM. I will be trying to sue, no questions asked.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c30bf4e6f59f:0x84a771810e82f5c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

0 stars if I could give it. I waited in my apartment the entire day for a signature-required package to arrive. I never heard a knock on the door or the doorbell ring, and when I went to the mailbox, I found a “missed delivery” note. Conclusion - the courier decided to default the package as a missed delivery without attempting to get my signature. 2nd time this happened. First time, my package was undelivered because the courier “could not” enter my building, a blatant lie because there was a note in my mailbox, which is IN my building LOL. I’m going to the post office again tomorrow morning to retrieve my package. There needs to be some kind of accountability for consistently irresponsible conduct on the part of the couriers.<//review>

<Text>This place is totally a mess. Called their number for more than 30 times in 2 hours. No one answers the phone. I managed to get some of their internal numbers and someone answered, ONCE! Those USPS people can only answer one phone call a day. I guess two are just to much work for them! Every single people or org should stopped using USPS as their service is just kidding. You live in the best country on earth and live with the worst mail service in the whole universe!</Text>< response>

The most disgusting,irresponsible,uneducated workers at Pasadena California US Postal department,most of the employees can't even speak simple English in order to read simple home addresses I always get wrong mails and my mails get lost how do they get hired go figure it out, and the most irresponsible supervision,no supervision at all why? because they hide behind their union and they are protected by their union,and good luck if someone answers your call.</Text>

Online USPS tracking said it was "Delivered, Front Door/Porch." No package was delivered. I know because I was home all day. I called this facility (while at work b/c they don't answer in the afternoon) to ask. Their system told them that indeed it had been delivered to my residence, when in fact it had not. I had a second pair of glasses delivered through UPS. No problems experienced.

They never pick up the phone during afternoon/evening hours. They should not post open hours "3AM-9PM" if they're not available for customer visits or calls during those hours. They should at least have an automative message when not available to prevent customers from calling a million times hoping for someone to pick up.<//Text>< Pics>

This lobby has limited open hours on weekends and holidays, so mail can be dropped into an indoor delivery slot.  Other post offices in the area lock their doors, so there is no access.</text>

The woman who claims to have managed this location as well as the one on Colorado for over 30 years is a raving witch with no professional customer service skills what so ever. I watched as they were unhelpful in explaining to the girl in front of me how to pay for a package and have it sent out on a later date. They then proceeded to call me a liar when I told her the other office across town was able to print out a shipping label, and yet she refused to. Then she goes off and starts yelling at an old man at the pick up window. Maybe she had a bad day, but that is no excuse to treat people this way. After 30 years, you think you would know how to deal with people.< /Review>

I went to the post office on Lincoln in Pasadena after hours to use the self service kiosk. When I went to drop my packages, the drop box wouldn't work because the cart on the other end was overfilled. I fiddled with it, tried to press the buzzer in the will call area to get someone's attention, tried again, etc. I could see through the blinds into the main service area and tried to get the attention of an employee but she gave me a "we're closed" hand signal and turned her back. I waited, and tried again when I saw two young men behind the counter. I rapped on the window and they ignored me for as long as they could before one yelled "We're closed!" I yelled back that I knew that, but that the drop box was full. He said "Okay," looking totally bored and without offering to help. I asked if he could empty it and all he said was "Not right now." ...Not right now?? I just watched you and the other employee chatting for three minutes while ignoring me. It would take 30 seconds to swap the cart out for an empty one. That and the fact that IT'S YOUR JOB. I just paid for this postage because I wanted these packages to ship in the morning and now am going to have to take time out of my crazy schedule to come back in the morning so that they ship out in time. I waited for 10 - 15 minutes and had three people refuse to help, and will have to take another 10 - 15 minutes to do the same tomorrow when this whole thing could have been resolved in under a minute if your employees weren't so determined to be unhelpful.< /review>

Call the Pasadena office to speak to someone.  If you don't fit into one of their prompts, they say hold for next available person.  Then they hang up on you.  So typical of Postal Service.</Review>

Forget the haters on here - the post office is great for anyone near Pasadena. There's a 24 hour dropbox out front for small packages, reasonable parking out front, and the staff (while busy) are generally helpful.</Review>

<review>Same experience as others- they don't pick up their phone and it just hangs up on you... I tried maybe 10 times. I went there looking for my vacation hold mail- they don't have it and don't know where 3 weeks worth of mail is that includes hundreds of dollars worth of packages and tax information. I have to go again and wait for a second hour to try and get them to call the carrier. PS my mail carrier is a jerk who folds and ruins envelopes to get them in the box instead of putting them on the door with the packages, even if the envelope says "DO NOT FOLD"... this included a diploma.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>We moved to this post office's jurisdiction 2 months ago (filled out a change of address prior to move) and we're still not getting mail.  We tried to call, no answer.  Phone just rings and rings.  I went in to talk to someone and was told "people probably just aren't sending mail"... except that they are, and the mail is being returned "residence vacant." UPDATE: Just had ANOTHER package not delivered. I had to go into the post office and was told "there was something wrong with address, so we sent it back to the sender" even though according to the tracking #, everything was correct -- apparently they just didn't want to bother checking the tracking # in order to obtain the correct address.  This is the WORST post office I've ever dealt with.< /Review>< Pics>

I filed a complaint and the Pasadena Post Office Staff phoned me ONCE and left a message.  .  .  BUT when you call back:
1.  No one picks up the phone, it just rings and rings until you get cut off
or
2.  You leave a message and no one returns the call
or
3.  The line is busy
This has got to be the worst U.S. Post Office in the U.S.
No customer service at all, don't even ask about the long lines in the post office.<//text>< Pictures>

I went into speak to the carrier supervisor and was given someone else.  she gave me the supervisor name and phone number but they don't answer it says " wait while your call is  transfered to the operator and then it just rings for ever, it doesn't go to voice mail it just goes to a busy signal after a few minutes.  They are useless, especially the carrier supervisor.  I think his name is Jeremy.<//Review>

<text>postman threw his bag at my dog who had gotten away from me, then panicked and slipped on the letters and fell on the pavement.  Then he lied and said the dog had bitten him.  I was right there and saw no bite.  Now the  supervisor refuses to have my mail delivered. I will route everything that I can through other services, but this affects delivery of things like drivers license and mail-in ballot.  I have tried twice to deal with the supervisor Maribel Alvarez, who said she would get service restored, but she has not done so and is nearly impossible to reach by phone or email.  I am now going to have to contact Judy Chu and/or an ACLU lawyer to get back the service that my taxes help to subsidize.  This post office is taking inappropriate advantage of the civil service system.<//text>< pictures>

<text>THE WORST POST OFFICE I HAVE EVER BEEN IN....

The relief carriers for the 91106-1458 do not deliver packages to the door as post office rules require (I am a former carrier). I have multiple pictures of this illegal practice. They dump the packages at the community mailbox which is totally visible from the street. Our packages regularly get stolen and I regularly go to the Post Office on Lincoln to complain TO NO AVAIL. I went this morning and the young man at the Will Call counter told me that no one was there to hear the compliant and suggested that I call the Postal Inspectors. I have been doing this for years. This particular post office is a disgrace to ALL postal workers. No one cares, no service and no pride in their work.....It is just disgusting. I am beginning to thing that this on going mail theft is related to the post office....

Update: I received my Christmas presents from my daughter in Oklahoma today. My regular carrier left them outside in the rain. All the presents are destroyed.  I went to the Will Call counter to complain to no avail. Notice he is not even wearing the mandatory uniform to work with the public at the counter. This is one of the worst Post Offices I ever seen....just disgusting. Everyone in this office should be fired and I mean everyone. No one gives a damn about their job....

Update 3/05/2019
Mailboxes on my route constantly left open. See pictures. Also the multiple open USPS cases of complaints that go unresolved continue to go unresolved. Nothing happens to a union protected federal employee. They continue to mis-deliver mail and packages, damage mail and packages and now I know how our mail is being stolen. They are too lazy or stupid to lock the mailboxes....

Update 3/08/2019
Mailboxes on my route left open and unlocked second time within a week. You would have thought that on 3/5/2019 when I reported it the first time, it would have occurred to USPS to do something....But Federal Unionized Employees don't believe in or use sentient thought...

Update 3/11/2019
Mailboxes continually left open and unsecured. This is the third time and the the Lincoln Post office doesn't even respond to my complaints.

Update 3/16/2018
I signed up for Informed Delivery within a week of me signing up, USPS has already lost some of my 1st Class Mail. When I email Jeremie and Patricia the Postmasters of the Lincoln Main Office...NO RESPONSE...
USPS where we lose mail and damage packages and there is NOT a damn thing that can be done about it because we are unionized federally protected employees...USPS where your federal tax dollars are continually wasted...

Update 4/3/2019
I signed up for the service Informed Delivery because of the horrendous mail service in the 91106. For the last two days, Informed Delivery says I have 1st Class mail but I have received no mail at all. They must be punishing me for documenting what sorry service we have on the 91106.< /text><username>Stephen Stubbs</username></record></dataset><record>

I've been to many usps locations but this one takes the 1st place trophy for being the worst. Every aspect of the location is mismanaged. Long lines and wait time at either pick-up window or regular customer service windows. The employees here seem to be taught to take there time (10 minutes) minimum with each customer. The self service machines seldom work and are inaccurate when it comes to the package weight.

USPS needs to completely overhaul this entire location starting with the careless staff. Los Angeles has many unemployed people looking for work that would be much faster and appreciative of having a secure job i believe then the unappreciative slow ass workers at this facility including the non existent management.

p.s. second place goes out to the Santa Monica location but that's another review<//text>

Online request means nothing to them. I requested online to deliver my package on Tuesday when I missed the first delivery which required my signature. Then I waited at home for the whole day, but the delivery didn’t come. The next day, they putted a final notice for my package in the mailbox when there were never a second delivery. My whole day got wasted.< /review>

The final "S" in USPS which is supposed to stand for "service" should be eliminated from the anacronym.
I have never had a positive  experience when calling the Mack Robinson USP Office. Today was no exception. The man who finally answered the phone after 5, yes 5 successive calls until the call auto disconnected, is extremely rude and argumentative.
I called about a package that was supposed to be re-delivered today & was not. He said only a supervisor could help me, saying Manny is the supervisor. When I ask to speak to Manny, he said he's at the other end of the building. More interrupted conversation wherein he states he is a supervisor but refuses to give his name. Refuses to tell me name of local postmaster, then informs me he will have someone cal me back & hangs up. He never asked or allowed me to give my name & phone number.
And I helped fight to keep this branch open! For what! I can easily purchase stamps at the grocery store & request services & supplies on line.   This guy opened a huge can of worms. If I have to start with the US Postmaster General & work my ay down, I WILL get to this man's supervisor!</text>

One star is one star too many. This is the worst Post Office Branch I have ever dealt with. Our mail carrier tried blaming us for the neighbor’s pets being loose and tried to start a physical altercation with my son when he tried to aid him. He even went as far as to start using profanity and threatened to “mace’ the dogs even after telling him they weren't ours. Needless to say, he suspended our mail service and when restored they kept mail and packages that we had a written confirmation that they had arrived. In addition, my medicine which was my most urgent need was being held out of spite. I rather deal with a starving pack of rabid dogs than to deal with this post office and it’s minions. To date no packages, letters or medicine has arrived.</text>

Trying to avoid going here because their customer service is disgustingly terrible. If you guys aren't happy with your job THEN QUIT. Instead of taking it out on customers. 😡<//review>

Right, so this is the Post Office you're looking for in Pasadena. It's annoying that Google doesn't put this one in the top results. It's open until 7, that's why you want it. Other than that, it's a Post Office. People complain about the Post Office, but it works, and this one is no different.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) There was a huge line and I just wanted to make sure of the prices of the stamps that are for postcards since I was going to buy them at the machine, he did not want to help me and in a rude way he said I will not help you. That is their job or that they put someone to guide us in any questions we have. But we do have to wait up to 10 minutes to process our mail when they make a mistake. Hopefully you find supervisors who are engaging and friendly. Also, I am not the only one to give them 1 star, if it were not for me, I would give them

(Original)
Había una fila enorme y solo quería asegurarme del precios de las estampillas que son para postales ya que iba a comprarlas en la maquina no quiso ayudarme y de una manera grosera me dijo no te voy ayudar. Ese es su trabajo o que pongan a alguien para orientarnos en alguna pregunta que tengamos. Pero nosotros si tenemos que esperar hasta 10 minutos para procesar nuestro  correo cuando ellos se equivocan. Ojalá que halla supervisores que les llamen la atención y sean amables. Además que no soy la única en ponerles 1 estrella si por mi fuera ni una les pondría< /review>< Rate>

It was a quick and easy experience. I was especially impressed with the person who helped me was not afraid to ask someone else for clarification and confirmation on a particular  tax deduction item. It made a difference of several hundred dollars in a refund!!<//text>

<Review>Called your Hancock office in Murrieta to ask if the coupon I had forgotten to present when I paid was  still usable receptionist said she was not a tax analyst and could not help me but would have a tax analyst call.  It never happened.  When did coupons become a tax issue?  I had a 20 percent discount as a new customer< /Review>< pics>

The staff is polite and helpful. Myra, the agent who has done my taxes since I moved into this area, has been professional in her manner, helpful in explaining technicalities of tax law, and efficient in working through what seemed to me to be complicated matters.<//text>

<review>First off, H&R Block; the name that usually comes to mind when thinking about tax preparation. While I have always been a do it yourself guy when it comes to taxes, as I have gotten older and more successful it seems that my taxes are more intricate; enter H&R Block. I was lucky enough to secure an appointment with Michael Haly, a senior tax advisor, and man am I glad I did. Michael took the time to explain the entire process, what I was doing right and what I should document better. Michael discussed my various options in regards to deductions and documentation, and provided me with some valuable advice for next years taxes. Finally, Michael helped me get the best deal for my dollar, telling me about the various programs and specials that H&R Block were currently offering.

BOTTOM LINE: Go to H&R Block for your tax preparation, ask for Michael, save a ton of money, wisely invest the money that Michael saves you, and live happily ever after. Sounds pretty simple to me!</review>< pictures>

I cannot suggest strongly enough that you NOT go here. I 100% agree with the other reviewers who say that they had issues with their crowns, rude staff, and that it's very expensive and the services are more money than care motivated. The only pleasant experience I had here was the removal of my wisdom teeth with an oral surgeon who is an outside contractor and doesn't actually work here. As an example, one day I was here for around 9 hours for 2 fillings-one needed a crown and the other an inlay. During that 9 hour appointment, I had 3 different dentists working on me, including one fresh out of dental school as well as the owner of the practice. Fast forward to a few months later, my crown fell out while chewing. When I went back to get it fixed, it actually needed to be redone again due to decay. A few days after the second crown was redone, a dark line appeared all along my gum line around the tooth and you guessed it... it needed to be redone AGAIN. Even now, the crown is bulky and ill-fitting, but there's no way in hell I would let them have a 4th go at it. Stay away!!!</Review>

AVOID!!! Very high-pressure sales. My husband had a bridge done and need to be constantly shaved down for over 2 year. Just recently,  went back for another shaved down, only to find out his tooth is cracked.  My husband has been in pain over this same tooth for over 2 years. I called December of 2020 to let them know I had covid 19. I made another appointment for 30 days later with them practically shoving me out the door. They told me that I needed to go back to get tested again. They wanted proof that I was negative before they would let me back in. I guess it doesn't pay to be honest these days.  They want to charge my husband $500 to fix his tooth when they probably cracked it themselves. I wouldn't send my enemy to this place! The only reason I give them 1 star is because they are nice people most of the time.< /text>

Dr. Aulick and his assistant Frances were amazing. First time at this office and they were very professional. There was no wait time, they work very efficiently and I didn’t even feel like I was at a dental office (which usually is scary) definitely recommend this office to all my family and friends!!<//review>

Went here 1 time back when they first opened (from what I understand they're still trash). The lady at the counter told me that my insurance would cover everything. AFTER the procedure, I am notified that my insurance wouldn't be covering it and that I'd have to pay out of pocket. They also tried to rake me over the coals by suggesting treatments that I did not need. I had a family member that used to go here as well, but would always have to go back because the quality of the work was so poor. My family member had crowns crack on them on multiple occasions shortly after being worked on at this place. Not only that, the staff was pretty nonchalant and unhelpful about everything. No sweat off their backs, just lie to patients. After seeing some of the other comments, I made a good decision never going back to this place.</text>

I am so happy and pleased with Redlands Dental Group. They are by far the best dental office I have ever been to. They make me feel welcomed as soon as I enter the door. The dentist and hygienist there are awesome they meet all your needs and do what ever they can to get your treatment done same day if needed. Front office staff is amazing they take time to answer all my financial, and clinical questions! Thank you so much<//Text>

Not a fan of how the staff can NEVER give me a solid answer of when my next appointment is. They changed my appointment date without telling me twice in one week and I live in Los Angeles, so they have essentially wasted my time this week. Extremely disappointed.</text>

They leave you waiting and waiting...never one time. They only want your money, don't care about their clients. The rooms are dirty...floors not swept, and this is in the am, grimey chairs, and machines with some kind of splatter. On top of that, some of the front office staff are rude. This place is awful.</text>

I haven't been to a Dentist in many years. I have gone in to get a tooth fixed. They were very nice and professional and did all ex rays of my teeth. I have had a cleaning and a temp crown done so far. No pressure on the next steps. Nancy is awesome. Nearly no wait time with being a busy person that is great. Hope all goes well with my future visits.</Text>

This place is absolutely terrible. They DO NOT care about the patient they are 100% a profit mill, there is 0 compassion. I was left in a room alone for 95 minutes before a lady came in and berated me about obviously unneccessary dental work and absolutely outlandish fees. This is a common tactic used by dental offices to create anxiety and push the "customer", not "patient" into paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for work that doesnt need to be done. They will tell 100% of their customers their 1 year old fillings are fractured and need expensive replacements. This is a place to be avoided AT ALL COSTS VERY HIGH PRESSURE SALES. Not to mention my original quote was almost free, once noticing that the lady left and came back with an additional $900 charge on the corrected bill. This included unmentioned services I did not agree to and was not necessary. She literally fixed my nearly free bill to be over 1000 dollars in a few minutes. DO NOT GO HERE<//Text>

This is truly the nicest group of people I've ever worked with.   They are professional, efficient and diligent.  I appreciate the flexible hours with early morning and even Saturday appointments.  Most impressive is the level of care.  Dr. Chung is the only dentist I've ever had that called me the night before my appointment to speak to me directly regarding my issues.<//Review>

They are wonderful, everyone there is very nice and professional however that being said I had to have an upper partial made with back teeth and one front tooth, the lab they use screwed up royally on the mounting so it did not fit properly. The back teeth of partial had to be ground down so I would have something to wear and I had to have a new one made. I was upset that I might not have the right partial in time.
That was my initial post before I knew that dr Neil had gone above and beyond to make sure that I had my proper fitting partial that I could eat with in time for my trip. He put me in touch with the lab and all is good.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Both my husband and I have been patients at Redlands Dental Group & Orthodontics since 2015.

After retiring and insurance changes, we had been to two other dentists and had negative experiences with both.

The staff at Redlands Dental Group always makes us feel comfortable, are friendly, and always keep us well informed.

Dr. Aulick (Dentist), Dr. Maio (Periodontist), Dr. Nguyen (Endodontist), are compassionate, actively listen and advise. They made sure treatment was painless (well, after a major procedure there is always some pain).  Meghann (Our Hygienist) is wonderful as is Lisa (Office Manager).

There are others in the office (whose names we can’t recall) that are also friendly and helpful.  Maggie, especially, deserves a special mention.< /review></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I was over charged & billed twice for the work that was done. The crowns I had put in shifted after they were already in & I had to go back to get them adjusted, after time went by I had to go to a different dentist to get a cavity taken care of that resulted from my crown being to large & not being able to brush/floss food out of the crevice. For some reason they billed me the full amount without including my insurance, so my insurance had to mail me a check as reimbursement, then they sent me a bill for $600 after I was reimbursed. They're nice people but the work is terrible. There are many other options available around this area in terms of dental care, I'd recommend to avoid this place at all costs.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This is a great dental office.  Dr Jackson has a lovely chair-side manner, a gentle touch and is good with local anesthesia.   I no longer avoid going to the  dentist!    They never try to sell you procedures you don't need. They have low staff turnover and the support staff gets to know you by name.   The dentists are  involved in volunteer and charity work.  Support this great local business.<//Text>

My son and I both got our braces here and we couldn’t be more pleased with the results.
Dr. Chiakowski is wonderful. He explains everything thoroughly and is a great orthodontist.
I shopped around and decided on Redlands Dental because the price and financing worked within my budget.
The staff is friendly and professional.  We never felt rushed and they were prompt with our appointments which is very important to me because my time is valuable.
Not one complaint here. I highly recommended this place!</Review>

Some of the staff and Dr’s have changed since I last reviewed but I get people grow and move on. However, the stellar job that’s done in replacing staff is amazing. My family now sees Dr. Neil since Dr. W left. Just when I thought we couldn’t  have a better doctor, Dr Neil and and his team have proven us wrong. He’s genuinely concerned and compassionate to your needs. It’s like having an honest friend kindly tell you what’s best for
You!
Our family members don’t all share the same insurance so in regards to fees, we pay according to what’s best for us and what we are willing to invest into our health. If insurance helps then wonderful, if not, my families health is worth more than the insurance game and worthy having skilled, talented and Licensed professionals perform that work. You get what you pay for!</review>

The doctors and specialists give you piece of mind with their quality of work. The receptionists and support staff are amazing as well.  They are at the top of their game with their outstanding technology.   They keep up with all the lastest techniques and machines and all that stuff.  Very cool office and staff.

The staff is very friendly So I’m a little bit sad I have to give such a bad review. To me the place feels like it’s all about the bottom line. I had a crown put in recently that never really felt right. I had to go in for several adjustments. It ended up being a root canal. Then the crown broke in half last week. When I went in to address it they didn’t want to accept any responsibility for their work or even look at the history of problems it had since they worked on it. They wouldn’t cut me any deals on the new work. I’ve never run into a dentist that didn’t stand by their work. They don’t have to give me the crown for free but they could’ve at least done it at cost. To me that’s just bad business. I will never recommend this place or go back again.<//Text>

<Text>I would not even give it one star! I paid in advance for services and I did not receive all of the services I paid for. I wanted to apply my credit to my child and they told me I could. Now that I've tried to do so, they are telling me that I don't have the credit and I did receive my services I had paid for in advanced. I should have $2,000-$3,000 credit! I have taken further action to get my money! DO NOT COME HERE! I also had a horrible experience getting my teeth cleaned. It was extremely painful!</Text>< Rating>

I do not recommend this office for any services. It runs more like a used car lot than a dental office. Over-priced services, up-selling of treatments and products. "Why pay $90 for a crown through your insurance when you can pay $900 for our overpriced product that will be ready in just one hour"? No thanks. Here is how my visit went, first x-rays, then taken to an exam room to wait forever, then the dentist came in for an exam and told me all of the over-priced treatments that I needed. And then I was escorted out....but wait, I came in for a cleaning, don't I get my teeth cleaned? Then my insurance was over-billed for treatment and services that I did not receive. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.< /review>

I LOVE THIS DENTAL OFFICE AND THE ENTIRE STAFF!!!!! I took my son today 05-06-16, and from the moment we entered the office to the time we left, was an amazing experience!!!! The entire staff was warm and very welcoming.  The dentist (Dr. Chung), was amazing and made my son and I feel very comfortable.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST REDLANDS DENTAL GROUP AND ORTHODONTICS!!!!</text>

Super rude and condescending dentist.
Front office staff not helpful either. Requested MY records, staff holding on to them like they are theirs. They’re not, they are MINE.  Told me my new dentist can request additional records, which is nonsense. Back office staff took TWO HOURS taking hundreds of xrays and ct and pictures, then front office staff charged me $25  for 12 tiny X-ray printouts, after all that time and insurance money I wasted.  Just not a good experience, at all.<//review>

<Text>1 Star because Yelp doesn't accept 0. DO NOT GO HERE!!! SCAM SCAM SCAM. We were charged 1200$ that our insurance says should have been $115 each. & when my husband showed them they said "well that's not how we do it" so they don't go by what your insurance says, just what they want to charge. The girl I dealt with tried to change the estimate in front of me to make it more expensive, & then when I asked why it was different then my husbands who was having the same exact thing done she left the room, then came back & changed it again. When presenting the estimate they made it seem like everything was a part of the procedure, nothing was optional, come to find out that wasn't the case. When confronted about the fact they weren't honest about what was optional we were called liars. As fellow business owners this is NOT how a business should be ran. Do yourself a favor & go somewhere else, literally ANYWHERE else.< /Text>< pics>

CROOKS.WATCH OUT! Im so disappointed with this office. I was going here for the last 4 years. first off my crown that was put on 3 years ago just completely fell off. Then at the end they quoted me thousands of dollars even though my insurance covers 75% of everything. Keep in mind three years ago I had no insurance and they charged me the same today for the same work! With insurance! The lady trying to sell me at the end was really rude and un friendly. I was really disappointed two hours walking out with not even the cleaning I came in for . This place has turned into a money hungry non ethical scam beware.</Text>

Apparently a nerve is still there that they didn't take care off. In the last few months we have tried calling them asking what can be done and we are getting the run around. Lastly being ignored by not getting called back nor emails answered. Mom is still in pain. Took her to a different place which quoted us a price of approximately $800 to rectify.

<username>Neena Gopalan<//username><Review>Relocated to Redlands and had to find a primary dentist. After much searching around for a facility that will accept HMO, found Redlands Dental and requested to see Dr. Jackson after reading all her positive evaluations. She is just fantastic. Always in a cheerful mood, joking around, and great with procedures she did for me. Never felt any discomfort or pain. I wasn't quite happy with the bills I had to pay for these procedures, but that is not Dr. Jackson's fault, it is the way insurance work (or, don't work). I am going to stick with Dr. Jackson.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

We have never had an encounter with anyone there who was rude or dismissive.  The care that my family has gotten from them has always been good, and when they made a mistake on my bill once they fixed it without argument or complaint.  We have never been charged for things they did not do, and they have not tried to "upsell" us on things that we don't need the way our last dentist did.  Our experience has been very positive.  We have been going to this dental office for 3 years.<//Review>

Friendly faces. Great dental hygienist who will be gentle. They were also wonderful in letting me bring my toddler to acclimate him to the environment. Both Drs. Jackson & Penaflorida are knowledgeable and patient in explaining treatment plans and options. Not pushing the most expensive options.< /text>

0 stars really needs to be an option. Do not, DO NOT let this place rope you in. The shiny decor in the front office is no indication of their treatment. I've waited up to two hours to even be taken back, and my dentist (who has since left) would have two or three patients she was working on at the same time, so you will wait between each step (and often have to be numbed again!) My root canal today started off with the endodontist forgetting to check whether my mouth was numb, and starting to drill. I wasn't numb, and he didn't see my hand raising asking him to stop, so it took me crying out in pain before he stopped. I genuinely leave this place in tears almost every time. Please, Please, DO NOT go here.< /Review>

The staff has changed dramatically and not for the better.  I have spent alot of hard earned money and they are johnny on the spot to give you more than one avenue for credit lines of sorts.  They had a credit on my account for over a year and then a needed procedure for ortho was done. Instead of adding this to the existing account they sent my daughter the bill. Then when we complained, they sent to my husband, and lastly they have turned this over for collection under my name.  I tried to contact the amazing collection agency folks and guess what.  No contact listed is viable - cannot connect or failed call.  Be warned.  Whatever changes they  put into place were not customer service oriented. My daughter will now be targeted in waiting time and service for the duration of her ortho services I can guarantee.  The office manager needs better training because she is the reason for my rant.  I hope Carrie gets some advice from HR on handling situations better as I am writing the management, the BBB and will makes sure my complaint is heard.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Not sure why they have bad reviews, girls up front are super nice and I joke around with them every time I'm in there.  As for people calling it "corporate" all I have to say is that it costs money to run a business, this is a business.  All the work I've had done was good and all the dentists and staff are super professional.  I'm having a bridge done and it required an extraction by an oral surgeon.  The DDS who came in to do it was superb.  It isn't free and they do push for the best (most expensive) option but it's your responsibility to review it and make any changes you feel appropriate. I went through my quote and made changes and they worked with me on it.  I think people just want everything for free now.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcaa0d2b2771b9:0xd8554ed537886713<//GmapID></record>

<Review>My wife had a cavity and they said she didn't. All they wanted was $800 for a "deep clean". They don't deserve one star. Do yourself a favor and stay far away.< /Review></record>

I was always petrified to go to the dentist. Dr Neil and his assistant at Redlands dental changed that for me! They were very professional yet very careful to make me feel secure that I would be ok! To me this was very important as I was so fearful which also made their job more difficult but they helped me overcome my fears! I read a lot of reviews complaining about price but I did not find them to be overpriced and also realize that it is very exspensive for one to complete dental school as it also is for doctors, veterinarians ect. So one must take that into consideration. I was so happy with the work I had done and also the fact that they can fit me in when I have an emergency. The manager is also very kind and deeply cares about her employees and goes the extra mile to make sure the company has caring, knowledgeable dentists, hygienists and specialists! I was impressed that they are " up to date" on so many new procedures! I love the staff at Redlands Dental and if your a big sissy like me I highly recommend them!< /Text>

Unprofessional and very rude, the receptionists alone should be reason enough not to go. I've never had any issues with dental work but when I was suggested I needed an extraction I just knew something was up. I didn't argue then and there but I should have walked out. Totally regretted not saying anything,  I had work that I didn't need and disrespected by the people there... :(< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>They care more about making money then their patients. I got 3 caps done there and all 3 came loose while I was flossing in under 6 months. Then they charged me to glue them back in. Plus, they over billed me because they weren't running my insurance, and tried to tell me my insurance wasn't converting services so they could bill above the negotiated billable amounts set by my insurance. I'm still trying to get money back from 2015 and 2016. Not to mention that they're always behind schedule, so it takes forever. Almost every appointment was at least half a day ordeal regardless of the services received. Save yourself the frustration and just go somewhere else.<//Review>< Pics>

Horrible for Oral Surgery! Had Dr. Siem and like other reviewers, not happy. After Surgery my husband wasn't consulted by Dr.Siem nor was I. As soon as I woke up they hauled me out. Like Cattle is a term I have read in previous reviews and agree with 100%. I went in for just 1 wisdom tooth removal and made sure they knew that was it as I have a dentist so I wasn't subject to the upselling. I did overhear a lot of it while waiting as others reported for them to get to me 45 minutes after my appointment time. The charge didn't seem inflated but was a bit more than quoted at Loma Linda. But they are an exclusive provider on my dental plan so that may be the difference. At this point I would not recommend going here for Oral Surgery. I am waiting for Dr. Siem to call me and give me the after surgery consult I feel should have happened the day of. I spoke with the Manager Lisa and she seemed concerned and listened but it seems this is the way the office works.<//Text>

AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!! Me and my family just started at this dentist. I went first for routine xray and cleaning. I wasn't charges anything as it should be for my insurance. The next week my mother went and they tried to charge her 35 for the same services, we thought okay there was a mix up, no big deal. The following week, her husband for the exact same thing, but this time trying to charge him 70 when it is suppose to be free!! All three times these people were trying to push expensive and unnecessary procedures and products. They are just a money hungry corporate dentist office. If I could give less than one star, I would.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><resp>None<//resp><Review>I like our dentist, however the reception staff is awful. Today,  an elderly woman was trying to check in via the office ipad . She was obviously having trouble working the device. She asked for help,  but both receptionists were rude to her. A huge line formed and they still refused to help her or acknowledge anyone. Finally, I asked if it was possible for them to either help the poor woman or start checking the rest of us in manualy. She retorted in a snippy voice that it wasn't possible for them to check in the customers via the computer. They let the elderly woman fumble around for several more minutes before finally signing her in manually per my second request. My sign in took 17 minutes. Front reception staff is the rudest staff I've ever experienced.  I will be shopping for a different dental  office today!< /Review>< pictures>

Worst dentist I have ever had. I have had a good amount of dental work don't in my life and this was the most painful experience ever.  The dentist I had ,couldn't have been more unprofessional he would stop drilling or whatever work he was in the middle of to chat  or flirt with the assistants or to talk about party the night before. On top of it all they are really expensive and they use some of the old school methods on some of the work they do . Well they should have spent some of money they used on the remodel of the office to update their methods . I wouldn't recommend this dentist to my worst enemy.</Text>

I first showed up just for a cleaning. after the cleaning they told me I needed a crown and a filling. This seemed odd to me because I have had very few dental issues in the past. Unfortunately I let them do the procedure. The day I came back in for my crown the temporary cap came off, leaving an exposed nerve end.

When they sat me down in the chair they immediately began work on installing the crown. Little did I realize that this was about to be the excruciating experience of my life. They first sprayed compressed air directly on my nerve end causing me to jump out of the chair cursing obscenities!!! I told the woman that it hurt, but she didn't seem to care and she pressed on applying a steady stream of cold water to the same exposed nerve. I leaped out of the chair and told her I couldn't take it!!! The dentist replied go ahead and sit down, were almost finished. Reluctantly I sat back down in the chair and we finished the operation.

I have had three knee surgeries and none have been as painful as this procedure without Novocain.

1. I was treated like I was cattle
2. very impersonal and un-empathetic service.
3. They are great at pretending to care.
4. They forgot to use the Novocain!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Sooooo  pissed right now!!!! I paid $1200 for my wife and I to have our teeth to be cleaned because they said it wasn’t covered by my dental plan.... Then when I get home to check my policy coverage I find out that my copay should have been $115 per person. They said that’s just the way it is. So now they will also be getting paid by the insurance company and I’m S.O.L 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬 DO NOT GO TO “REDLANDS DENTAL GROUP”!!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I scheduled an appointment for this, showed up, and they did xrays and told me I should get thousands of dollars in work done, then sent me home without the cleaning. Here we are a few weeks later, and they billed my insurance $600 for the xrays alone.  That's 60% of my limit per year, on xrays, and they didn't even clean my teeth! They never once told me that the price was going to be that high either! In fact, on my "treatment plan" that I told them I couldn't afford to get done, it said my total cost for that day was $150.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Beware of this dental office, there practice is to have you pay up front for any dental work.  Yuo are told even on you next visist that you owe money and you have to pay before you go to the back.  They have never offered a payment plan, so if you don't have credit cards or money on your debt card you are SCREWED.  The front office staff are very unprofessional and not well trained.  I am always on time for my appointments, but yet I have to wait 30-45 minutes before I am seen.  My appointments are always in the morning when they open so they can't be running behind.  Since I can't change dental offices right now, I will only go for my cleanings and check-up.  I will not have any more dental work done at this facility.  I have also written my insurance company to make them aware of what is going on and the unprofessional procedures.  To sum thinsgs up BEWARE, AND BE VERY AFRAID.</text>

<text>*This establishment is no longer Open in Azusa. Bye B-Man's....see you in Duarte* Teriyaki chicken sandwich, Katsu chicken, and shaved ice(with sweet milk...mmmm) can all be found at Bman's. The Azusa location comes with a handy dandy drive-thru.....amazing! The menu board is off by .20cents or so, but you really don't notice unless you add cheese to sandwiches and are on a tight budget. Good food makes this a good place for lunch or dinner.<//text>< user_id>

<Review>Okay, I really do not want to be harsh here, but I went with one of my work mates who raves about place and I was mortified. The chicken was dry, the food got to me cold and the customer service was poor. The young lady who I went with still said she loves the place and I could not help but question her taste or lack thereof.
I would not ever recommend this place to anyone and I keep trying to get up the nerve to try it one more time to see if it was just a bad day for them, but to be honest they are way too high priced for fast food to take another chance.
Sorry, but one big "stomach turn".
Remember, Peace starts with you.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

One of my more favorite fast food places. The burgers & chicken bowls are really good & the mini chicken with the side of mac/potatoe salad instead of veggies is the perfect little meal when you need a quick bite to eat that isn't terribly unhealthy for you.< /review>

<text>Sandra, the nurse practitioner for Dr Gregory  is the worst! She is rude, impatient, she doesn’t answer patients question and she’s condescending. If you don’t want to talk to your patients and answer their questions then why see them in the first place?? You’re a doctor your job is to talk to patients, to explain to them what’s wrong with them. It is your job to answer ALL their questions and tell them exactly what is wrong with them. I will not be returning to this place because of Sandra. I want a doctor who actually talks to their patients.<//text>< pics>

I showed up 30 minutes early as requested, then was actually seen for the treadmill test at my actual appointment time (shocking for any doctors office)...then the real fun began.

After my 35 min treadmill test, I was placed in the waiting room. Seen about 40 minutes later to answer a couple questions & give my medication information. Then told it would be ONE AND A HALF HOURS of a wait to see the doctor.

The doctors/techs are fine & do a good job, but your scheduling system is AWFUL.

Being held hostage when you could easily release people & call/message them. Or reschedule for another appt for results as a standard procedure.

Or at least advise people to bring a snack & book & a pillow for their disgustingly long waits.</review>

<Review>SO upset with this place. Arrived 15 min early for my appointment at 3:30 and by 4:45 asked if I was going to be seen soon as I had to pick up my daughter from daycare. They said there was another patient in front of me and there would still be a wait. This was the second time my appointment had been rescheduled. The first time The Fresno office told me to keep my appointment with the Clovis office after I specifically went in with an insurance question call that I thought may hang up the appointment but because they told me it wouldn't be an issue I still went. Immediately after arriving to my Clovis appointment they rescheduled me. I'm a single working mom that has taken time off for both of these appointments so I'm wasting days to request off, losing money and on top of that the biggest issue is I'm not having my serious health concerns addressed. I left and immediately started crying with frustration. If they don't have time they shouldn't schedule these appointments.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Excellent doctors & nurse practicioners & PAs staff this business.  You will get excellent care here.  The main downside is that the wait time for your appointments may be quite long, depending upon who you are scheduled to see.
On the upside, it is right next to Saint Agnes hospital which has a full service cardiac facility available 24/7 & 365.<//review><Resp>None</Resp>< user>

<review>Great Cardiologists, horrible appointment history. The date of this review I was informed that the doctor (Hanks) is running three hours behind. That means I will spend about four and a half hours here. That's NOT a rarity.

UPDATE: We finally left the office at 10:00PM (that's not a typo). If it wasn't so important for me to see him (cardiologist), then we would have given up a lot earlier. While this Is an extreme rarity, they really could do a better job in scheduling appointments.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I live out of town and away from my adult daughter and wanted to hire a driver with a luxury vehicle to transport my daughter for her birthday outing. I was able to communicate with Dodo to set this up. The driver was so kind to stop prior to picking up my daughter for her birthday outing and grabbing a dozen roses for her. Grant it, this was added on to my balance as an additional stop (not a large fee at all). But I was so glad with the driver being willing to pick up such a beautiful bouquet and present it to my daughter just as I had asked, especially with me not being able to be there with her to celebrate her birthday. The Cadillac Escalade was clean, in very nice condition, and the driver was very kind and professional, according to my daughter. This is a really good company for transportation to any event or for whatever your luxury transportation needs may be. They do well to ensure that the customer is happy. Thank you, Dodo! 👏🏽 🙏</Review>< user>

Driver was 15 minutes early, very professional, and work his mask throughout the entire trip. She also knows the roads very well, helping us avoid a delay to airport - there was a car accident and he was able to navigate back roads to get us there on time. Highly recommended.< /Review>< Pics>

Best Airport Car Service I seen in my life. Me and my Wife went to Los Angeles Airport from Carpinteria. Driver was totally mind blowing and unbelievable helpful. While Covid-19 going on they didn’t refuse me for service.
Thank You for your Nice & excellent service. Your online Reservation system is helpful and easy to Book.</Text>

< review>
Excellent in every way! We were picked up promptly very early in the morning to go to LAX in the SUV I requested by a cheerful, helpful, professional, careful driver. Clean, smell free vehicle with water bottles provided and friendly chat when appropriate. Pick up when returning was at Dulles, prompt driver was there with a sign at baggage claim, also professional, friendly, and excellent driver. I am a SB native and both drivers took the best routes for the time of day.< /review>

Amazing.Consistent good service. no qualms ever about them showing up on time. Won't cancel which is more than I can say for the last couple out of Dodo. They tend to cut and run when they see the mayhem at Terminal. Want to impress a client? This is the way to go.Thank you so much< /Text>

<Text>Stanley was extremely helpful at helping me set up a premium bus rental fro my bosses' daughter. I can safely say that with all the companies I contacted Dodo Limo & Transportation has the best customer service.He made the process of switching the dates last minute so hassle free. Definitely the company you want to go with if your looking for a premium bus rental.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I was picked up by Dodo upon arrival to SBA, traveling to Oxnard for Dallas Cowboys camp. I was extremely impressed with the professionalism, clean/nice vehicle, awesome driver. He made it very easy for me to load and unload with an infant! Being that I was so impressed, I scheduled them for my return a few days later. Same exact results. Wonderful business!! Thank you Dodo!<//text>

I was lucky enough to not only schedule a car about 2 hours before arriving to SBA,  I was greeted by the owner of Dodo Limo & Transportation right at Baggage Claim with a friendly smile. He is kind, professional and most importantly an extremely safe driver. In talking with him I know his team of drivers are just as great. I will recommend to all traveling to LAX Traveling for work can be stressful but this was such a wonderful experience. You will be the first I call when I am back! Thank you!</text>

Always nervous when picking a service of any kind from the other side of the country. I found Dodo on the internet and went with them because of their excellent reviews. Dodo provided a prompt and efficient experience from initial booking to drop off at the airport.</review>

Great service! Dodo has been the go-to for my friends and me throughout college & our visits to SB after. He is so willing to help out your group in making your experience the best it can be! Definitely a great person to call if you want to play up your night on the town and show up in a limo.</Review>

He was right on time and we boarded his white stretch limo for a quick tour of Santa Barbara, followed by a few hours in Solvang, and then a trip to the Berkman winery.  We had a very enjoyable day.  His suggestions for lunch and the winery were right on the mark.  We had booked 6 hours for the tour and we were back at the dock at least an hour before the last tender back to the ship.  I would definitely recommend Dodo for cruisers off of a ship when in Santa Barbara.
Thanks Dodo for a great day!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Lets hope they dont get rid of my review this time, because i really want people to know that this isnt the 5 star dental that they think it is, i will continue to write reviews about it in hopes that others that are thinking about even stepping foot in here know, i will write my full experience by the end of my treatment.

<text>My son and I had very pleasant experience at Hart Health Center Dental. My son was very anxious about the appointment and any procedure having to do with shots. Dr. Samoha was very patient with him and spend time trying to calm him down, the staff was very helpful and kind and always available to help. Dr. Samoha is very professional, he takes the time to explain what needs to be done. It's not easy to find a good dentist for your kids, I highly recommend Dr. Samoha and his staff for kids and adults.</text>< Date>

I'm in love💗 with this office.The front desk is AWESOME personally. My kids are comfortable with the xray tech, the dentist she was explaining every step to Andres(4yrs. Old) her assistant clean his teeth in a soft manner.
He got a price after the cleaning.Thank you Hart Health Center.<//Review>

Let me start this by saying Dr. Dan is the best Dentist I have even met!!! Very very professional, and very cool. Dr. Dan knows what he's doing, i had root canals and some cavities taken care all in the same day, which left me more confident about my teeth.

I dont like the dentist lol but I definitely recommend coming here they'll take care of you !<//Text>

<review>I've lived here less than 2 weeks and I'm so unhappy. My toilet quit flushing, and the light in my fridge shorted out and then broke in my hand cutting me. I still don't have a mailbox key nor will the mgt open the box to give me my mail. I've told them about all of this, and they just keep coming up with excuses for why things aren't getting fixed. Finally, a maintenance man came and temporarily fixed the toilet and told me if it happens again, to open the tank and jiggle some hose. No. I just want my toilet to run as expected. Fix it. Then, the very next time I tried to flush it, it wasn't working. I've called them multiple times about these issues to no avail. Then today, a huge roach jumped out at me. I've called  the after hours maintenance and haven't heard back. I've asked for them to fix the issues or relieve me of my lease and pay my moving costs. We shall see what they do.</review>< userid>

<Review>I lived here for 18 months, 9/16 through 3/18. Started out great, nice apartment, old, but nice and open. Nice neighbors and staff. The manager arranged periodic community get togethers in the common area. At staff change that stopped and repeated calls for repairs were ignored. I would like to believe this was just an adjustment period. I don't mind waiting for something, but i DO mind being ignored. I would be willing to bet that they have found their stride and are running smoothly now. I moved because of work, nothing else.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7REhxZmup9WFAKlA21foWY_fTOALGv1lAcwn0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
June 2017 my husband and I rented a 2nd story apartment with Twin Creeks, This was our first home together as we got married the next month. As it stands today I can not tell you how many management teams there have been in the last 2 years. Lets start at the beginning:

Move-In Day: Delayed for 3 days after original move-in date, never found out why. When we were finally able to move in we noticed there was nothing clean about the apartment in fact we found food in the cabinets so we spent the first day of our delayed move in cleaning what should have been a clean apartment. We noticed we were missing a kitchen window screen and a balcony sliding screen and several blinds and reported that right away, 4 months later we got the screens but never got the blinds. Thankfully I had a friend who lived here who found several in her storage unit when she moved in and she gave us some to fill in the missing holes.

November 2017: Our stove quit working and after putting 2 work orders in the problem has still yet to be resolved. The refrigerator has never gotten cold, we buy our groceries by the day which is kind of annoying.

December 2017: The sliding glass door track broke leaving us unable to close the door a week before Christmas they fixed it, kind of. About this time we started noticing cracks at the ceiling of the fireplace and in fact almost every crease of the ceiling throughout the apartment. We counted 5 cracks and reported them. We were told this is California that is natural.

As the problems continued our kitchen still barely worked in 2018, our washing machine failed twice (guess it is a good thing I work somewhere that has repair people who came to help me because no one responded to those work orders either). Our 5 cracks turned in 18+ now some reaching from ceiling to floor others widening and some are moist.

December 2018: Our bedroom ceiling started leaking yellow water even when the heavy rains or any rain were not happening. We called the office again and that took 2 weeks for roofers to come out but we still have the hole where the water fell from in our bedroom. Near that hole we now have a rapidly growing black substance that is about 2 foot long and 7 inches wide. We suspect that it is mold and have reported it but got nothing from management. Remember that problem with the sliding glass door in 2017 well it happened again it took them 3 weeks this time to fix it cause they had to call door repair people, oh and in case you are wondering the solution offered  by management to the cold rainy weather and the fact we couldn't close our door was turn the heater on.

August 1 2019 WE TURNED IN OUR 30 DAY NOTICE TO MOVE. Also our toilet apparently has been broken and is now flooding our bathroom and the one below it. It is now 8/3 and it still isn't fixed!

In my personal opinion the best advice I can give to anyone who comes to look at this place RUN, DO NOT DO IT! Twin Creeks is not worth the 1700$+ they charge for rent!!! (Included are only a fraction of the cracks that exist in our apartment)

August 9th the plumbers are back but the apartment downstairs is still leaking i have now taking 3 days off of work lets see about a 4th because they don't care that we are trying to pack and leave this hell they only care about the tenant who never should have moved into a broken apartment unit!< /Review>

<review>The Teammembers at Twin Creeks are stellar! Thanks for your attention to detail with making sure I am pleased every step of the way with my new location, listening to me and not over selling what should be a natural choice for quality at a nice price. Your assistance with my desires for a great location to live on the property and exceeding my expectations!  Go Team!  And a extra special thanks to Jessica and her direct supervisor ( her name is right there..... Sorry can't remember, she's still a great young lady and her style of leadership is clearly evident as the smooth sailing of operations is on point at Twin Creeks 2016 ).< /review>< pictures>

I like the layout and the balcony, fireplace/mantle, quiet, new carpet, big closet, work out room, location overall, landscaping, Donald the maintemence guy is nice, dishwasher, and washer and dryer in unit. Also the trash pick up is nice from your front door.

I dislike the roaches, smelly and old cabinets, water damage, loud street nearby so you cannot enjoy fresh air at night and hope to get any sleep (they can't really help that), parking (watch out for towing.....very costly!) Outdated kitchen and bathroom.
Overall it jas been fine. I would live here again. But not great. So there you go.</text>

The outside of the apartments  appear  to look nice but once you move in it's a whole different story. Bugs all year round. They don't come out when you ask them to fix something we've requested multiple times to have are laundry room doors fix and still no one has come out to fix them it's been 5 months and we've called and went into the office . They are over priced for such bad service we will not be renewing are lease. Also they make you pay for garbage but the company who pick up your garbage doesn't come on the days they should and they leave trails of trash . Bad  neighborhood we  will definitely be moving before we have our baby< /review>

The staff are nice and professional but they don't follow up with concerns! The community looks nice however the apartments are really old and it's obvious! I would only recommend them for the nice and friendly staff!< /Text>

My wife and I currently live in Twin Creeks I would say it's the worst apartment complex. We've had so many issues in our apartment that we have brought up to management and they have never sent anyone to fix the issues. Twin Creeks als has a bad problem with insects as well we have to get our apartment bombed and we still have a few pest issues. In addition to that the pool isn't always clean. But I would say the top issues with this apartment is that the management is poor and nothing is ever fixed. These apartments seem better than other apartments in this area but once you move in here you will see they aren't that great. If you can pay the extra money and move to Brentwood or Oakley.< /Text>

<review>was a former tenant from twin creeks, and it’s basically  a place  that you want to stay away from,   you get all sorts of new charges, no to mention that  they sell to you the water at a very high price, since you have no water miter  even if you are on vacations,  you get to pay  the same amount even if you are not in the house, bassically all tenants are being charge for the water used on the pool & water pond where fish are, not  to mention the garbage service imposed  by the office they charge you 45 for the valet garbage service, which they should, t be charging for garbage, if you forget garbage can outside of apartment you get a penalty for  25 dollars,  any ways, the only good thing about that place  it’s just the park on the side, kitchen to small,  management  uncap able of solving issues on premises’, my ac system never worked for the 3 years i lived in this place they couldn,t fix it and suggested me to buy a windows ac system,  that is sucks,  go to the office with a complain if you get lucky they will get it solved within a week or two, manager says it’s the average time for thing to get solved, winch I personally think it’s to much,,,
lots of roaches, infested with mice  winch are the only animal  you can have in the apartment out of charge, cause they can get rid of them otherwise you will get charge for it, check  all reviews, and don’t fall  for it,   pretty much what most of the  Negative reviews tell  you here,  is right   no more or less, I would,t rent or recommend it to anybody, Thank you!!!
when it comes to reviews,
manager says it doesn’t  affect them,  that is what I was told by him, and I thing he is totally wrong cause through as tenants they get their pay checks, but it seems he doesn’t care, hopefully management  will correct his attitude, cause through this kind of don’t care behavior, attitude  people is moving away..</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<rate>4</rate><review>I really enjoyed living here - unfortunately for me I had to relocate closer to work but I would recommend the complex to anyone in the area. Its a very safe - quiet complex and the management staff is always very friendly-professional and helpful which is an anomoly for rental complexs of this size. I read past reviews and those, from my experience ,seem to have been resolved with Marcus who took over right about the time I began my lease so I never had any issues whatsoever.
I gave four out of five simply because the one thing that I would like to say would be "better" is the garbage service. That's more a complaint for them directly - the concept is nice but it was just hard for me with my schedule to navigate this. Most likely would be fine for anyone with normal working hours. :)< /review>< Pictures>

The manager at this location is very rude, lack of customer service. Once they get rid of her I think they could have a better community. Im sure that coorpetate will be making those adjustments soon since they are unable to keep residents happy. I would be careful with the noise complaints I had 2 when I moved in from the downstairs neighbor who constantly harrased me and my guest I never complained bc I thought hey I live in an apartment complex and it's a part of it IDK.... worst thing EVER! The neighbor kept on making false complaints eventually the manager sided with her and refused to renew my lease which eventually forced me to move into a homeless shelter (where I'm at now) they didn't care that the neighbor had an extensive complaint record from all the other neighbors she was harrasing and pissing off. I love living there my son liked it we had a fresh start which was short lived due to false complaints and lack of customer service. I was there a year and they refused to move me to a different apartment and they had my parking stall in the other end of the complex, towed my car for having the bumper in the red zone which was just ridiculous but justified bc it was still in the red SMH (very petty) that is not a good way to treat residents. I never paid rent late EVERRRRR! And still they refused to renew my lease! The manager there is a terrible human being and lacks cunstomer service. I hired a PI to do an investigation on the neighbor so they will soon be hearing from my lawyer for them kicking my out for FALSE COMPLAINTS! I use to hear to much noise anywhere from people having loud sex to baby's crying waking me up all kinds of hours of the night NOT ONCE DID I MAKE A COMPLAINT.... bc I lived in an apartment complex.... HELLO!!!! But hey not everyone is as understanding as me... do yourself a favor and ask about those things before moving to this apartment complex.<//Review>

<Review>I’ve living here for over 2 years although I do not recommend this place to anybody
roaches all over place, not to mention mice, those are the only pet included in your property and come free of charge, and they can’t get rid of, cut garbage service, if you forget your garbage can outside apartment you get a penalty for 25 dollars each time, I worked hole day no time to pull garbage out so I’m paying for a service that I don’t need but it is mandatory
And like someone said in the review, and it is very thru they keep adding charges,
Don’t believed get an apartment so that you can see shitti service, people just comes and goes, because of that... get  an apartment  and see for yourself, but don’t say you weren’t warn of all of this
So over all, for the price you can get a better place in Oakley or Brentwood which by the way ‘crime and theft it is becoming already an everyday thing, got the windshield of my car broken cause of that... thank you!!!<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1375261790365< /Time></record>

Besides that I wake up in the middle of the night too loud music outside and people breaking into cars.My car was broken into they did nothing you think they would gate the apartment complex or have security but no because they dont care.Garbage is $40 a month and they dont have garbage dumpsters if they miss your garbage and they only pick up weekdays only but no holidays.

I can't stand Safeway, and this is one of the previously "independent' markets Safeway took over.  Rotten service, normal and excessive prices, not exceptional fruit or vegetable selection.  A Safeway, in short: a safe way to waste your money.  Berkeley Bowl is nicer, cheaper and much more expansive in every way.  Do not waste your time or money here.  And that goes for all Safeway stores, in my humble opinion.  Only useful in a pinch.</review>

<time>1605198781980</time><Text>One cashier lane open, 6 people with full carts in line. It’s faster to put all your stuff back, walk to Safeway, and recollect all your stuff if you’re trying to buy an “express” # of items. If only this store would keep 2 cashiers up front and open the express lane...</Text><gmapID>0x80857ea1418f38db:0xc9bc9a888d86227</gmapID>< Rate>

The food shopping is great- if a bit expensive. Right now, they are tearing up/resurfacing/rebuilding the parking lot in front of the supermarket. A large part of the lot is closed while the work continues. It's awkward getting in and out...<//Review>

<Review>I won't go to this place ever again. The staff is very rude, and it is not like I've only been there once to judge them like that. Every time, I tell myself that because it is 3 minutes closer to me than the (other) Safeway, somehow, it's worth it, but I've been wrong! You hear that Walmart or $1 stores customer service is not good, but to be honest, I have never been treated worst in this store than any other stores/shops. The only reason that I'm giving two stars not 1 is because the store basically has whatever any other store has.</Review>< Pics>

A pretty solid grocery store in terms of the people there and the quality of the produce. You'll find most things you want there although if something is missing, you'll almost definitely want to go to the other Safeway just a block away. This Safeway definitely gives more of a farmers market vibe in comparison< /review>

I like the idea of a smaller market place. It was almost closing time 9 pm, so not too crowded. Its in a lovely and safe location.  The employees need to stop talking loudly to themselves and focus, instead, on the customers. I'd rather listen to some quiet music.  They're probably worn out at the end of the day but they should still put on a happy face for their customers.< /review>

I went pretty late at night, but hella things were not stocked. Pretty inconvenient.

ADDITION:
do not go late at night. They tend to only have 2 cashiers working (and they're close self-checkout for some reason) so there's nothing but two massive lines that can take up to 20 minutes to wait through.<//Review>

I give stars because the store is very clean and everything looks so yummy! The African American cashier was a bit rude...he didn't greet his customers, only offered a bag and stood there with his arms folded.

I absolutely hate when cashiers do not greet me.< /review>

<Text>It's Safeway! Not sure why it's next to another Safeway. Otherwise, pretty standard selection. We haven't tried the hot food but the groceries are fine. Safeway is expensive in general so it's not our default store, but we always check it out when there is a certain item we need that we can't find elsewhere.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Amazing collection and friendly staff. But if you want mainstream brands for everything, you might find it difficult to get a few items.</Text>

<review>There is only so much one can say about a Safeway.  This one is a former Andonico's and has retained some of the layout and a good bit of the staff.   They are à very nice staff, old and new, and the service is very good.</review>< Pictures>

I shop here not so much for the selection of items but because it's close and convenient, it's open late, they have a parking lot and if you use your club card you can get stuff for cheap. Produce quality and selection are decent but they sometimes fall down on restocking items through the store. Cashiers are kind of grumpy. Today the cashier replied to a text in the middle of ringing up my order. Guess it couldn't wait..<//text>

I wish I could report better experiences shopping at Safeway. Staff's morale always seems to be low and they are rarely interested in helping their customers. Checkers seem to want to escape the checkstand regardless of how long the lines are.</review>

<text>This store used to be Andronico's and I loved it because the meat market and seafood market you would get your items wrapped in butcher paper. That is something that I miss when going to other supermarkets.The only thing that has changed is the name and I believe the market is still the same.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

This is the high

end of the Safeway stores. It was ounce a family owned deli called Andronico's. The store still has some of the same items as the family deli had. There are 2 community markets in Berkeley. One is at the top of Solano Avenue near the Alameda The other is on Shattuck Avenue in the Gourmet Ghetto. The cross street is Cedar.

<text>Money saving tip! Download Safeway's app. There are digital coupons and discounts in the app that give you free items you actually can use. I love avocados, and get some free every month along with other offers. The app is for both Apple and Android phones, and the stores have free WiFi. You can add the app from the notice that pops up when connecting to the WiFi. I remember this store from when it was Andronico's. Now it's a Safeway, but some of the same nice staff are here. The selections have shifted a bit, but the prices are lower. It's nice and clean.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80857ea1418f38db:0xc9bc9a888d86227< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My pet peeve with this place is the misnomer 'Community Market". It has nothing to do with the community, other than being a giant retail chain in the middle of North Berkeley. The name is an insult to the original CO-OP market formerly at this place which WAS a true community market built on the co-op principle. This store is a Safeway, no more no less, with average food and customer service. It does have a good bakery, offering more high end pastries than  the regular Safeways. Other than that, I actually prefer the offerings of the larger Safeway a couple of blocks away. I think Safeway bought the Andronicos stores to get rid of competition. How long will they keep this store open having another, remodeled Safeway just two blocks away?< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>I like andronicos and shop here regularly as it's at the end of my street, but it's super expensive for regular groceries, normal items like beer, tortillas and cheese are really expensive. Produce is really good quality and not that much more that Safeway. The brownies are the best! Avocados for 3.49 though, come on andronicos, drop your prices a little!< /Text>< user>

Pricey end of grocery options but has a good layout, fine produce, good deli selections and a great house bacon. Stop here once or twice a month or when I'm feeling like a treat as they have a good selection of single serving desserts.< /Review>

<review>It's a small Andronico but what I like about that is that it makes going in and out quick. Andronico in general seem to be more pricey compared to other grocery stores, but they also carry higher end groceries. I like their selection of meat, seafood, etc.</review>< pictures>

Lines to check out are always obscenely long. Beer prices at Safeway are more than Whole Foods, Trader Joes, or even the new Sprouts. Don't have pretty basic things in stock like dried chickpeas. If you want anything that might be considered "niche" like kimchi or tahini don't bother coming here they don't have it. Trust me. Pretty small produce section as well. Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, or Sprouts have much much more.<//review><Rate>1</Rate>< Date>

<text>A big disappointment after the switch from Andronicos. Yes, many of the great people from Andronico's are still there, and there are a few of the old products, but too much has changed, and the prices are just as high. The fruit and produce section especially is a problem, weak selection and high prices. If people want Safeway stuff there is a Safeway 2 blocks away - why do we need another one in the neighborhood?<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Safeway took over Andronico's here and has been great about keeping it much like Andronico's was.  They have many items that Andronico's used to carry plus Safeway items as well.  Very friendly employees, hot bar, sushi, custom sandwiches, and good deli section.  Love to eat and shop there.</review>< pics>

Miss Andronicos. Produce here is a major downgrade vs Andronicos. Despite this being walking distance to my house, I now take 100% of my biz to Berkeley bowl unless I have no choice.  Old cashiers made this feel like a neighborhood grocery store. New ones they've mixed in kill the vibe, clearly aren't happy...which makes me wonder about mgt. and how they're treated/trained.< /review>

<review>After Andronicos sold to Safeway we seem to be overwhelmed by Safeway in Berkeley. There are three of them within,two being two blocks apart. They are not the same. The community market carries better meat and seafood. The butcher and fishmonger are of a better caliber thar the Rose street location. The delicounter is pro. You can still get a good,made to order Samwhich at the deli. For a buck more they add double meat. With a semifreddies room and boars head meat you get a real samwhich. The seafood and meat are run in a more professional manner. Although the close a bit earlier,it is run better than the rose street store. Safeway seems to be competitive and trying to match the standards that Andronicos  offered . I feel that the Cedar st community market is caters to the neighborhood.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80857ea1418f38db:0xc9bc9a888d86227</GmapID></record>

Sorry to say it, but the pod people have invaded Andronico's and sucked their brains out.  Nothing but styrofoam left in their skulls.  I can't understand how the hallowed government of Berkeley could let this happen--like they couldn't have brought the Andro's folks over to Berkeley Bowl and have them teach how to do it?  A Bay Area tradition has been invaded and hollowed out.  Go to any Safeway--all the mediocre same for the most part.  You can find much better in BB, Monterey Market, and last but not least, Colusa Market.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It took over the Andronicos Market. I thought it had changed dramatically since it became a Safeway store, but I was relieved that the product lineup and service were almost the same as before.
I'm worried that I'm not competing with Safeway's neighboring stores from the beginning. I want you to keep it as it is.

アンドロニコス・マーケットを引き継いだ。Safeway店舗になって、劇的に変わったかと思ったけれど、ほぼ以前と変わらない品揃えとサービスに安心した。
元から Safeway の近隣ストアと競合を起こしてないのか心配している。このまま、維持してもらいたい。<//Text><Name>Tetsutaro OKADA< /Name>< Date>

價位有點高的超市，有機產品價高驚人，不是有機產品卻也不便宜。<//Text><gmap_id>0x80857ea1418f38db:0xc9bc9a888d86227</gmap_id>< username>

<review>(Translated by Google) Similar to the berkeley bowl, but the price is slightly higher, the supermarket is open in the east bay and SF.
There is a door-to-door service available. $$$
