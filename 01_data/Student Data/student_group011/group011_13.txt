I brought my foster kitten (3~4 months old) in for a flea bath and cleaning. I was mainly concerned about the fleas and when I got her back, they seemed to all be gone! She wasn’t scratching harshly (which she was very frequently) like when she had the fleas. She smelled fresh and clean. Art’s customer service was amazing as well. Highly suggest! :) Good prices too< /review>< user_name>

The owner lady told me to stay outside and no greeting at all. She made me feel like I went there to beg her. I stayed outside. When the lady with the other dog went outside I went in with my dog. I Waited and they never said anything to me. I went out with my dog and the mean owner lady stared at me. If they treat you like this  you know how they will treat your pet. Go to places where they respect you. Stay away from this place.< /Text>< pics>

<review>LOVE IT HERE!! So nice and such good service. My dog looked amazing. They even gave him a free flea bath because they found a few fleas on him!! They also have a great little store with a lot of well made products. Didn't take a while either, unlike the other groomer places I've taken my dog to. Definitely recommend!! 🐶</review>< pics>

I went to Andy's for the first time today, and my dog has never looked cuter. They listened to every instruction and executed it so perfectly. My pup came back happy and relaxed. I am so so happy with my experience here. Art was personable and great to speak with. I will definitely be bringing my dog back here for every groom!< /Review>< Pictures>

Made an appointment here for a wash and a cut. When we got there (this place is 45 mins from our house), they said they didn’t have time for the cut. Then they said dog won’t be ready until closing (our appointment was at 1). We asked for our dog back and they said it was too late, as he was already wet. They gave him back to us wet, unwashed and still charged us $80. My husband paid because they were holding our dog hostage. I am dubious that most of these five star reviews are legit and suggest you do not take your pet here.

Do not believe the 5 star reviews. As others have stated, this business offers a discount for 5 star reviews.< /review>

I usually get my dogs nails trimmed with my vet in Pasadena but I wanted to find something closer. I took them for a nail trim and this is how they returned them.
When I called him to inquire about the injuries and obviously get my money back.

- He first claimed my dogs had that before coming in.
- He then claimed were aggressive mind you I live with children and go to a daycare. I told him if they had been aggressive he could have called me and I would have understood.

- I had to take them today to the vet and the vet told me the red eye cause is blunt trauma. This means somebody hit my dog!

- The owner of the business never apologized and kept saying he was feeling stressed.

- I did get a return for the money but this is unacceptable.

I am now having to pay $200 for the vet visit and medicine.

DO NOT COME HERE!!< /Review>

We've gone here multiple times since moving to LA and our dogs always come out fresh and clean. They handle full grooming care and the price isn't too bad. They even seem to do well with our dog that is super high anxiety around strangers. The staff has always been friendly and helpful.</text>

My dog is a bit shy and is wary of people, but when I picked her up she was all tail wags. I've been told previously that her fur is a little challenging to deal with (as I often groom her myself, I agree). But they did a great job, trimmed the fur between her paws and overall made her very neat and fresh within a window of less than 3 hours.<//Text>

3/5/2021 _  Friday @ 9am.  If I can give Andy's Pet Grooming 10  Glowing Stars🌟 - I will.  The Owner is very Friendly & Accommodating. BANFIELD Pet Hospital & PETCO Glendale Highly recommended To bring my 10month old Kitten for grooming. I was hesitant at first due to some 1 star reviews. But, after the visit today __  I am  A FAN!  I will surely be back & This will be my Cats Favorite Salon!!  By the way, My Kitten was so happy & hyper & running & ready to play (Maybe she  just Missed me;))
---when she got back home -- I was very surprised !!   -- I think she loves her new Hair cut & spa treatment . I AM a HAPPY MOMCAT!  Thank you Sarkis & Your staffs  for treating my Cat such a little Queen of Glendale! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤~  Miss K.< /text>

Very Bad Experience

I took my 2 small dogs to this place a couple of months ago.  Since the first interaction, I noticed the cashier was recommending way too many services that I did not request.  I accepted most of them (like teeth cleaning, ears cleaning, nails cutting, etc.) always thinking I wanted my babies to be pampered and look nice when they were ready to be picked up. I noticed the receptionist/cashier kept telling me about the cost of a “Flea Treatment”, without not even knowing if my pets needed it or not. I firmly told her my doggies did not have any fleas. “I check them on a daily basis. I am sure they don’t have any fleas”, I said. When it was time to pick them up, I was told that both of my dogs were infested with fleas and that both received the Flea Treatment. To make the long story short, the cashier informed the services rendered grand total was $149.00.   I fell robbed!  I never authorized such treatment for my dogs, which I was sure had no fleas at ALL!  I had to pay anyway to get my dogs back. I love my dogs like they were my own children. I will pay for any service I consider they need, but paying for something they did not need was very dishonest, unfair and unprofessional.  Pet lovers:  Be aware of this so called “Pet Grooming Service”!!!< /Text>

The anti-Big Box store, and locally owned!  Great selection, very competitive prices, and if i'm not mistaken the owner--Peter-- is also a stand-up comedian.  More in the helpful, nice-guy Ray Romano way than the aggro-preening Dane Cook style.  Which is good, because our cats thought "Good Luck Chuck" was a crime upon humanity.</text>

The first groomer I tried by my house I did not like. This one is perfect! They told me about their  history and experience quickly making me sure my dogs are in good hands. Haircuts also were exactly what I skated for and so cute! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c1022ccedc19:0xd6be3b86845a7dc</Gmap_id></record>

I love bringing my dog to get groomed here. They are very quick and  my dog always looks great. Even on a Saturday, my dog is ready within 3 hours. They always have availability and you can book online. The owner is very knowledgable about dog behavior as well as dog hair styling. I'll be moving to a different area of LA soon but plan to drive back to Glendale every other month so I can stay with this place.<//review>

Great grooming prices and amazing  doggy daycare. I am so glad  that I found this place for my rescued super sensitive Maltese, my dog was very badly abused, and she has a hard time trusting people she is very scared . So it is always hard for me to fined a place where she can get groomed and not feel so scared. So When I first took her to this place for grooming the owner Art welcomed us very kindly made us feel very comfortable, made her feel very comfortable, then he offered us the greatest package for grooming very cheap and amazing 🙌🏼, when I picked her up she looked amazing she got her teeth cleaned,  she looked and smelled amazing. Then I had to leave out of town so I left her with them for 4 days, they worked so well with me, they answered my calls the sent me pictures they are the best place in town. Art is amazing Andy very hard working and he loves what he does and he loves his customers<//text>

When you walk into Andy's Pet Grooming  you immediately feel comfortable and happy!  It is clean, warm and pleasantly welcoming.

< Review>
our 8 month old pup just got her first haircut at andy's. she was totally comfortable with them. she got a great haircut with all the other pet grooming bells & whistles. the price was totally reasonable. we didn't have to wait a long time. both art & terry were really friendly folks. I highly recommend them.</Review>

Andy's does a great job grooming our terrier mix. We sometimes take him there just for a bath. They always accommodate my busy schedule. They're professional and very nice.

I highly recommend Andy's Pet Grooming.< /Text>

< review>
My dogs are clean,  happy,  perfect.  Even my fidgety, active dog did very well.  Get the teeth cleaning, trust me,  it's a small fee for a beautiful cleaning job that other places quote you 100+ to get the black buildup gunk removed. Oh, and they're super friendly and accommodating,  parking is free and behind the building.   I'm just happy that they were attentive enough to notice a small bug bite and make it a point to point out it to me whereas my previous groomer would return my dog with bloody cut nails. Will use services again. Thanks.</review>

Great service, friendly, helpful employees. The store has abundant, free parking. The parking lot is flat, clean and even surfaced. There is handicapped parking and an easy way in and out for the mobility challenged.<//Review>

I laughed so hard. I took my yorkie in today for a grooming-including haircut.  After getting her back, I was just in shock. It was seriously the worst haircut I've ever seen. Like a little girl cutting her Barbie's hair. Upsetting? Yes. Some amusement for my day? Yes.
Even so, I will not be returning.</Review>

<text>Want to Recommend Andy's Pet Grooming.  My friend had a flea emergency  and she called him about 3:00 asking if she could bring in her little terrier rescue dog for a flea bath.  He was able to take her last minute,  finished quickly (1 hour), gave us some really good information about treats and why getting animal food and flea meds from large companies was not such a good idea since they may sit on the shelves for a long time and loose their freshness and efficiency.  He was friendly and has been in business for 10 years.  Moby's organic coffee and tea shop is next door.  Great coffee while you wait!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Being new to the area I was looking for a good groomer for my little one. Although the cut wasn't bad, they had cut her fairly badly on her belly that took more than two weeks to heal. I understand things happen, but what irritated me the most is that they tried to make excuses. For example she said "It seems to me she is not used to being cut so she is very jumpy". Even though my dog is fairly young, she has been groomed a few times prior with no complaints, at the vets, cool as a cucumber. Don't make excuses. I am only one person, but that is not a good first impression on a new client. :(<//Text>

Having little experience with cars the sales men helped me understand what was wrong with my car and helped me prioritize what needed to be fixed first based on severity. I was surprised they were not that pushy. They got a customer for life. Would definitely recommend.< /review>

<gmapID>0x80dcb13333be186b:0x5946b6355fd93bef<//gmapID><text>So I was having issues with my car the AC Compression was making noise only issue I had in my car I am the original owner from a 2001 Ford Expedition I called to get a quote give me the quote over the phone personally I thought I was a little expensive but I still went ahead and approved it I brought my parts in so I'm only paying for labor to replace my AC compressor 3 hours later I received a phone call Kirt sales manager tell me I need my tensioner replace supposedly because it was seized ones again I bought the part took it to them by know my total is $452 just for labor when the only issue was my AC smfh so know everything's repair according to Kirk know my starter solenoid it's not keeping the car on so he tells me that needs to be replaced only asked for me to pay for the park which was another $30 they install the solenoid then I get another call back explain to me it wasn't the solenoid that ended up being my fuse memory box doesn't make sense so I went in after he said everything was fixed pay my amount that I owe I went to start the car my overdrive light was blinking my check engine light was on the car wouldn't go nowhere the mechanic by putting it up on the lift it wouldn't go up the lift keep in mind this whole time I'm explaining to Kurt about my issue and he's there arguing and yelling at me telling me it's my fault it's my car trying to blame it on the brakes while the car wouldn't go skip the making up excuses when at the end of the day there are mechanics and it'll be in a better help then with the sales manager was so I ended up leaving my car work two more days and at the end ended up being like I said the fuse panel box that burned out for some reason when the original issue was just the AC compressor everybody be careful with this place because the sales manager will get over on you Andover price you Kurt was totally rude unprofessional I will not ever take my car here again after being a regular customer for 10 years and knowing Kirk for that long smh I forgot to mention he was trying to charge me another $50 for the final repair I was lucky and blessed to walk in to Firestone and spoke to the floor manager explain to her what happened it looked into it it took care of me professionally the way she should have I don't like Kurt also too I want to give out a shout out to Richard who was totally professional with helping me out and keeping me satisfied that's mechanic I would take my car back too BE AWARE OF THE QOUTES YOU RECEIVED FROM KURK if I were you guys I'll try to avoid him if you guys take the car to Firestone at this location is rude and unprofessional for being there for 40 years I think it's time for him to retire and he's going to be treating customers this way I have it on video that's true so if the owner would like to reach out I will show him the video thanks everybody have a blessed day</text>< Name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>First time here Anthony helped me and I needed a new battery and he got me a great deal on 2 new tires with a warranty, he gave options and found a great deal for me, he was very honest he quoted me a price for a battery and as I was waiting to have it put in (because my battery is hard to get to in my dodge) I guess it was the wrong size and the one I needed was a lot cheaper and he didn't have to tell me that and he did. I highly recommend this place. I'll definitely come back with other car needs. Also I was under the impression I needed a tune up and the other guy there told me I didn't need it yet, again completely honest when they didn't have to be and I appreciate that.</Text>< Pictures>

Me and my wife came here a month ago for new tires. They told us to come back and they would rotate the tires for free for the life of the tires. I am happy to say today I brought our vehicle in for rotation of the tires, and they even did a quick brake inspection all at 0 charge like promised. I highly recommend if your looking for a honest group trying to make an honest living. As a former Automotive Technician I rare let anyone touch my vehicles and I feel comfortable with the guys here.<//Text>

Great service. I needed an oil change fast and they did it. And they didn't overcharge me.  The other repair shops I've gone to try to sell me all kinds of repairs. Econo wasn't as pushy. They made some recommendations about repairs I should consider for the future. I will highly recommend Econo Firestone to all my friends.<//text>

I really hate to do this, but we have now stopped taking our vehicles to Econo Firestone. It used to be a great customer service and repair experience. Last time we were there was, well, the last time we will go there. Customer service was reasonable, but the repair work was sub-par. Having spent so many years taking our cars there, and some distance away from where we live in the Orangecrest area of Riverside, it's a shame to have to cut our four stars for Econo to two.
-----
We've been bringing our cars here for almost as long as I remember. They've always treated us fairly. They have many of the same employees from the earliest days. The city PD services their vehicles here. These guys get my highest recommendation. We've tried other places a little closer to where we live now, but always come back -- and two of our cars have stayed in top shape with over 120K miles each. What more can I say?< /Text>

<Text>When my shop and the Toyota Dealership tried to tell me that I needed a costly repair (that was totally unnecessary) to get my monitors ready for a smog check, EF staff coached me on how to go out and drive my vehicle to complete a drive cycle so that my monitors would become ready on their own. Thank you for being honest and for taking the time to teach me!!!</Text>< Rate>

I got an affordable smog check here with the Groupon. They did have an additional charge of ten dollars for my car but the price still seemed fair to me. They did good honest work.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Yesterday I took my 1991 Ford Expedition for a smog check and after taking about 40 minutes for my car, a male comes to tell me that my cars APM is "too high to smog" I asked him what that meant knowing nothing about cars and he said "I cannot explain due to California law" which makes no sense since it is MY vehicle registered to ME. I began to get irritated and then the man adds "but you can leave it here with us and we can run a $100.00 diagnostic test to tell you what the issue is" I immediately knew right then and there that this was a SCAM so I took my vehicle and left. Today I went to a Smog Only center over on Magnolia and my car passed with flying colors. The man here told me that they were most likely trying to pull a fast one on me which is rediculous. Although they have a great price here at Firestone I advise you not to waste your time here.<//Text>< Pictures>

DO NOT GO HERE!!! FRAUDE AND THIEVES!!! I went to to go get two used tires and they charged me $70 I paid and handed their worker my money and not even 20 minuets later they tried to say I never paid! And they were yelling at me asking me to show them my wallet and how much money I have. They’re extremely rude and unprofessional! NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!!!! Only one star because it won’t let me rate unless I choose a star!</Text>

Rude people in the front desk. Try to do a Groupon smog check special and it failed because of reasons that did not make sense to me, but they told me to run it for 40 miles and bring it back. So I did that and all of a sudden it passed. It just didn't make sense. And to top it off they ended up charging me again! I think its scam and people who work there are not professional.</review>

They are rude and wont work a minute past 6. I had my car there. I raced to get it picked up after work and the owners daughter who is so nasty mean said too bad I have things to do. Im not waiting for you! I got there 3 minutes after 6 and they were all gone. This company actually tried to charge me for storage fees the next day. Do not use them there are other Firestone Service centers in Riverside that are much better and a lot nicer. Why give your money to somebody who has no intention of providing any type of service.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>They failed my vehicle for smog and wanted to charge me $99 to tell me why it failed.  I had just replaced plugs and wires as well as several sensors and scanned it for trouble codes before I took it in.  On my way home it was idling a little rough so I scanned it again and found a code that wasn't there before.  2 of the plug wires were loose at the distributor (I had double checked those wires the day before and they were all tight).  I snapped them back into place and checked again for codes and the code was gone.
The smog guy was a jerk.  He was rude and condescending, walked away while I was talking to him and just had a general crappy attitude.
I went to another smog place (test only) and it passed.  I didn't have to wait 3 hours either, like I did at this place.  Needless to say, I won't be going back there.< /Text>< userid>

I hope you take the time to read my short book. Sadly, I have nothing good to say about Econo Firestone any longer. 6 years ago I had posted a 5 star review after they had serviced my Dodge truck and my wife's car. My brother, my son, and my employees were also taking their vehicles to them. Because six years ago they did good work with a quick turn around and backed up the work they did. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. I followed my son to Econo a month ago to drop off his truck due to a check engine light on the dash. They tested and said it was a catalytic converter problem. They also said he needed a new timing chain. My son told them that the truck had also been over heating. So please fix that also. Now mind you. They replaced both catalytic converters in 2013. Approximately 2 years ago, they replaced one of them again. But they claimed that this one was not one they had replaced prior. In fact for longest time they denied that they had replaced both catalytic converters until I told them to check thoroughly on their computer. Well, they found it. So several weeks later. My son still doesn't have his truck back, (Which they know, he uses for work most every day). They told him that they don't have a special tool they need to replace the timing chain. Said they had ordered the tool and were waiting to receive it.  But everything else has been repaired, including a new radiator and thermostat. After a third week waiting my son took his truck back. Still needing the timing chain replaced, he took it to the closest reputable auto repair shop near him. They had the timing chain replaced, and back to him in one day. It didn't take my son long to find that the overheating problem he had paid to be repaired, was still a problem. He took it back to Econo. They claimed it needed a new radiator cap. Said that they replaced it and it no longer overheats. He had already paid them to replace the entire radiator. Why wouldn't they have put on a new and correct cap? He got the truck back a couple days later, to find that it was still over heating. He took his truck back to the place that installed the new timing chain in one day, and they found that the thermostat was stuck and they replaced it. Meaning that my son's truck probably didn't need the new radiator or the new cap. His truck no longer overheats. He drove the truck over 50  miles to make sure that the dash sensor light stayed off, so his truck would pass a smog test. The dash engine light came back on. After paying Econo over $2,000 at this point, and them never being able to replace the timing chain. My son was getting irritated. Now I want you to know that Econo Firestone mechanics are the only people to work on the catalytic converters of my son's truck period. Well after he and I took his truck back to Econo yesterday morning, for the sensor light problem.  We were told there must be a short in the wiring to the sensors. At this point, we are livid. Myself, my son, my employees and all of my family are done with Econo Firestone on Arlington Avenue in Riverside. We will never take a vehicle to them again. If you don't want to be a victim of shoddy and incomplete repairs. Then I suggest you find a different auto repair shop. Life can be difficult as it is. Why ad unnecessary aggravation to the mix?</Text>

(Translated by Google) If they are very good but only to change tires because they don't work for mechanics, I don't recommend them. I had a bad experience with these mechanical dials.

(Original)
Si son muy buenos pero solamente para cambiar llantas por que para mecanicos no sirven no se los recomiendo yo tuve una mala experiencia con estos disque mecanicos yo no se por que no les ha caido inspeccion.</review>

There #1 seller is the strawberry bagel but yet fail to meet the demands on how many strawberry bagels are made everyday. I called ahead of time and asked them to save me 2 strawberry bagels but when I got there they were all sold out. Waste of my time and gas if they can’t make more strawberry bagels than other bagels. They know it sells out the fastest but still no change to maybe put out more strawberry bagels in the mornings.< /text>

With the same gloves they except money, touch meat products and touch counters, to save money they continue to use same gloves. When you remind them to change they show attitude. Very disgusting< /text>

This is a delicious little bagel spot! They have a huge variety of fresh-baked goodies, including some I've never even heard of, and a massive drinks case. They're not the fastest service in the world, but they are well worth the wait! Freaking delicious breakfast sandwiches, too.</text>

Very nice staff. Good service. Fair pricing. Line can get long during prime-time hours though so that can be a bummer. Great selection of bagel flavors and sandwiches. Tried their coffee but was not a fan.</text>

Okay, they are not dead on authentic bagels. But this place kicks butt on every other detail. Fresh coffee, good ingredients, get you through the line and get you your food. Super clean. Prices are excellent.<//review>

I love coming here after dropping the kids off at school. I always get a club sandwich it is by far one of the best I've had. The fresh sprouts and cucumber make this sandwich delicious. Coffee is also good quality. 👍👍<//review>

<Review>Service is always lacking whenever I go. The last time I was the only one in line and i stood there for a few minutes and never got a single person to acknowledge me. I saw they were all busy but just a quick "I'll be right with you" really does go a long way!! Ended up walking out. The owner is nice but the workers are always awkward to talk to. The food is good and the prices are fair, when you finally do order.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The food is always good, but the service is slow.  They might want to consider having a line just for people buying bagels and not sandwiches. The process is painstaking...food is good though!<//text>

Dissatisfied because they insist on not writing anything down, so my order is messed up again. The quality of ingredients and flavors are great, but their process of getting orders to the register accurately (especially when busy, which they typically are) is disorganized and managed like no other. The gamble of not getting a simple eggwich order correct makes it unworth the effort. I also noticed their voicemail box is full.</Text>

<Review>Horrible customer service. Expect to wait 45 mins, for about 20 people in line, any morning. I  dont understand how a place that is that busy only has 3 people working there.

1 added star because the bagels are decent.

No soy or dairy free anything, not even for the coffee. It's 2018, get with it.

The cookies were so stale and gross and tasted like saran wrap. Yuck!!!!!!

Coffee tastes like cheap, weak, gas station coffee.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809022b5fc26d6e3:0x3704705e08dd15ab< /Gmap_id></record>

Horrible experience here!!
First of all very rude customer service every time I've come here...
And most disgusting thing I've ever experienced..
I ordered and eggwich with bacon and cheese.. nice younger Asian girl with a very long ponytail took my order and made my food.
I open my eggwich and as soon as I'm about to take a bite of one half i see a black hair sticking out of my egg!! Literally pulled it out and it was a long piece of hair inside my egg it was not pleasant at alllll like wow. And the worst part was the hair for cut in half and was also in the other half of my eggwich...
I want to throw up right now...</text>

They don't have most of the bagels by mid-day and they don't intend on making new ones. So as a customer your choice is pretty restricted<//review>

< Review>
This place is a mess they don't have a clue about what they are doing first they are very slow in costumer services , they don't give a number for the tables and they should because they keep confusing the orders , the guy who are taking orders he got lost after few minutes later he could remember who has the order nothing compared with bagel street cafe in Dublin Blv. Never recomend!</Review>

I have gone at Bagel Street Cafe in Tracy, 3x it's been a disappointment every visit!!! Slow service, workers are rude, customer service is horrible! Workers at the store have no personality. Workers sees, you standing and waiting, no one bother to say, I'll be right with you... I have to ask for assistance to help me, after standing for a while.</review>

<Review>My sister and I visited Snyder optometry for the first time as we both needed  new eye glasses. The office is set in a house and not an office building. The staff were so helpful and kind that you indeed felt at "home".  Dr. Snyder was excellent and was explaining everything as he went on. We are looking forward to the follow up visit

<Text>I can have a lot of anxiety when going to the doctor's office. And when I walked into Snyder Optometry I was so nervous.  As soon as I was greeted by the receptionist my nervousness went away.  She was so warm and friendly.  The atmosphere is very homely and the furniture gives the office character.  You will love the fireplace in the waiting area. As for Dr. Snyder, he was the best. He was extremely patient with me when he was applying eye drops in my eye.  Is he accessible for phone calls? I called today and I got to speak to him. How often do you get to do that? I strongly recommend this office. Go check them out yourself.<//Text><username>Kelly Nelson<//username>< GmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I have been visiting Snyder Optometry since 2000, when I was first prescribed glasses for my nearsightedness at the age of 5. At that time, it was only Dr. David Snyder, and as a kid I remember being charmed by his professionalism, patience, and kindness. The staff only enhanced the experience of choosing glasses with their friendliness towards my family and myself. I have been going for my check-ups every year without fail and eventually I got contacts - though I continue to prefer my glasses. I remember when Dr. Harlan Snyder came on board, he carried the same qualities that his dad had; for me, a visit to their office has always had the same positive experience throughout the years. The staff genuinely cares and it really feels like they've seen me grow up throughout the years!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1604724237567, 'text': 'Thank you for the review, Guadalupe!

< Review>
Snyder treated us like family. Explained why not everyone may want every feature available and addressed how important fit is for my disabled daughter. Made sure we got what we needed and understood how insurance and financial goal.

Going to costco to get every feature without substance was like fast food and i have a drawer full of glasses ive gotten over the years i dont love.

Our new glasses fit better and we can see better. An example is i didn't know transitions reduce overall light content and make me struggle even worse in the dark.</Review>

I have been a patient here for over 10 years and the baton has been effectively  passed to the son Harlan.  The exam is thorough - the most thorough I have had for a number of years and the practice also has available equipment for eye diagnosis for eye diseases which is not commonly available at optometrists.  The office staff is experienced and friendly as is the professional so you can't go wrong with eye service.</review>

It was so nice to walk in and be greeted and talked to. I use to go to Linden but its such a huge very impersonable place, like Walmart. Dr. Snyder was great. When my 18 yr old walked out he said " mom I like him". I said " yeh kid, me too". Thank you Dr and staff for being so pleasant. We found a family eye dr because my husband likes him too:)< /text>

A good and clean office. The staff was very nice and informative. I do plan to keep on going there. I was even able to take my two boys there for their eye exam.< /text>

The staff is funny, kind and informative, they get all insurance info and give you options for you to choose. Dr. Snyder sees it all lol he asks questions that you don’t think about and really looks into your eyes, get it, he’s thorough and patient.
This office isn’t your typical eye place, it’s not in a shopping center or a mall or on a busy street. They’re not in a big box store either, this is like you’re personal private family eye Dr, they make you feel at home becz they’re patients are like forever family to them, which I will forever be You will fall in love with them because they’re The Best.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Like to see elevated food being offered.  Pricing is fair, however would have expected food to be better seasoned.  Quality was there and would get 5 stars had the food been presented and not lacking anything.  Just a little more salt would have fixed this review.<//Review>

< Review>
The website shows ‘dine in’, which was misleading, we had to sit outdoors. We had to ask for water and bread. There were flies all around our food, the owner, who waited on us, had nothing in place to keep them away , he didn’t even apologize for the inconvenience. The coffee was lukewarm. It was not an enjoyable experience. Definitely NOT worth the price we paid to suffer thru this. I’ll not be returning or referring anyone to this place.<//Review>

Vintage decor, traditional Italian fare. Plan on a REALLY leisurely meal. Everything is very, very slow coming out. The owner is ever present- not a positive or a negative. Disappointed to find all desserts are bought and not made in house. Wine selection is slim. Mahi mahi tasty, not amazing but good. Cesar salad served in a very,very small portion- but tasty dressing (not housemade). I expected more but for the price it was worthwhile.</text>

Great place for a great meal. Been back several never had the sme thing twice, still more to try. Food is always prepared for your order. Good wine, great variety of bourbons. The staff is always friendly and fun. You may pay a little more than other places in town but the food he is worth every penny I've ever spent here.</text>

Very small & intimate place. Great place for a date night with a loved one or a girls night out. The food is amazing very delicious. Good size portions. They do have a full bar which is a plus. The owner I heard is always there to greet the customers. We met him & he is such a nice man. Very tentative with the customers. Highly recommend this restaurant!< /Text>

Best pasta I have ever had. I had a good time. The restuarant seems small but its cozy and it isnt loud and I think it's one of the best spots to have a date on. I'm definitely gonna come back again. Again best pasta. The time it took for food was a little bit. But the quality of the food made up for it. I enjoyed our server short older guy. Super funny definitely broke down the wine selection and helped with a good choice.< /text>

Delicious - home made croutons in the salad, Prawns Fettuccine is my favorite. The Sea Scallops were superb!
We were famished... everything was excellent. I am still full. The ambiance was perfect - great way to celebrate my hubby's birthday with the family.< /review>

Way above the bar, great service great food. I'm glad Tracy has something really nice that's not a chain. Small personal atmosphere. Just really "nice"<//review>

<review>I have never had a bad experience here. It is my favorite restaurant!! All the food is sublime, the atmosphere is great. Everyone I have ever taken here has said it's the best and always brings their other friends! Anyone who had a bad experience should surely talk to Tomas. He always goes out of his way to make sure everything is perfect and he would want to know if you had an unpleasant experience.<//review>< rate>

<Text>The food was good. But when I ordered the steak they asked what side I wanted and charged me. I already had an expensive dish, and paying 9 dollars for a potatoe that they didnt tell me was any extra means that the $40 prime rib... is only the steak. I had a nice time and it was very good, but getting played like that definitely put a divot in the night.<//Text><Date>1537421447210<//Date><name>Anthony Olson<//name>< Response>

Thomas and his crew have provided me several classic dinning experiences.  Excellent food with spot on wine recommendations.  Best wine cellar in the area and a menu that will support any choice.</review>

<text>Great, gourmet eating establishment. I had a delicious Linguine Pescatore of mussels, clams, prawns, salmon, white fish, scallops in a tomato-based sauce and a spinach shrimp with vinaigrette dressing. My relatives had Filet Mignon and Petrale Sole dishes. The owner/chef was delightfully conversive.</text>< pictures>

bar none the best steak i've had in years! they beat ruth chris in quality, taste and freshness- an upscale family resturant. Big enough for groups yet quaint enough for romantic dinners. My choice for those special occasions or just for a candlelight meal. Great wines and drinks and desert will knock your socks off!</Review>

Never been in Tracy before, traveling and couldn’t stand the traffic. Magellan’s was in the list of restaurants. We did not call just showed up, should have called. They gave us the chefs table, no matter, at least we could eat. The drinks and food was very good, the portions on meat to veggies and carbs was just right. Plenty of meat, less carbs.

Thank for squeezing us in Fresno, Ca< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Decided to try Magellan's after multiple locals recommended. Small wine selection but fabulous and to the point, full bar. Hard to find parking, even on a Tuesday. Fragrant, warm bread on request, but cold butter. Not too annoying, as the bread was lovely. Now, the revelations! Caprese salad had beautiful beefsteak tomatoes and a high-quality mozzarella with a tasty balsamic reduction, and perfect basil chiffonade. On to the filet with peppercorn sauce and a red wine Demi-glace: I cannot express how impressed I am that the chef chose to use green peppercorns! That's typically how I made kangaroo with a green peppercorn sauce in Europe, but it was a learning experience for me to have this presented on filet mignon. Appreciated the addition of fresh parsley to the sauce. Absolutely brilliant!!! I suggest a deep Cabernet or at least a Merlot to bring out that peppercorn, I had a Pinot noir. It was absolutely to die for. The vegetables were an excellent accompaniment with a bit of broccoli, red onion, pepper and larger diced potato- everything was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.

Side note: Magellan's is one of the few restaurants that doesn't need salt and pepper on the table as everything is perfectly seasoned and salted, but they are unpretentious enough to offer it. Loved this!

All in all, we are extremely well fed and satisfied which is what anyone wants from fine dining. We are happy to have found this in Tracy and will return for the duck and lamb. Thank you, Magellan's, for a wonderful evening of spectacular food! Thomas, we enjoyed your company and will return very soon.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>For starters, the service was terrible. Many of the waitstaff ignored our table completely, also gossiping about us in plain sight. My drink sat on the table, empty for over fifteen minutes. One particularly nasty waitress would refuse to even glance at our table and when she did there was a permamnent scowl on her face. The food was certainly not worth the 20 dollars, as the calamari was grossly undercooked and the salmon on the pasta tasted straight out of the can. The lighting was dim, as if to take away the horrid appearence of the food. And five dollars for a Coke? Really? I could get a soda in a theme psrk for cheaper.  Honestly, I could not wait to just leave the place.<//review><time>1447522676363< /time><username>jenna<//username><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80903d225593ba49:0x7b915ebc14b4ec8d</gmap_id><Rate>1</Rate>< user>

< review>
We had been recommended this spot for a great lobster and prawns .. our service was poor.. for 45$ we expected a full size Lobster tail.. and more then 3 prawns.. it's started with us being seated and asked if we would like a few mins to order.. never asked us if we would like water or anything to drink before we looked at the menu.. then we were asked if we were ready to order after ordering we were then offered our drinks.. then as the second waiter brought out the appetizer mind u 13$ for grilled scallops and we got 4 tiny scallops not the bay scallops we assumed we were paying for.. he is the one who offered bread and butter.. then when got the bread and butter the bread was warm but the butter was frozen?? Then I received my refill of my iced tea and it had a few pieces of bread floating in the bottom. I grabbed the attention of the hostess and she immediately grabbed the drink then showed the waiter and he returned with bread drink in hand and asked if I added any sugar to thins drink cause sometimes the sugar clumps at the bottom. I told him I added it to the first glass and this was a refill.. he then states hhhmm that's a first.. not an apology not a I'm sorry let me get that for u...If I knew I'd receive grief for asking for a non breaded drink I would have ordered a 5$ bud light.. yes 5$ bud light.. Then our "waiter" was serving us with a blue tooth in his ear. We thought this was completely un -professional. Then the food finally came out and that's when we saw the baby lobster tail filleted out to look bigger. I feel like we were definitely not treated like they wanted us to return and for 100$ bill for 2 people that was hard to believe the lack of care for patrons. Needless to say we will never return there ever again.</review>

Based on a friends recommendation we choose to try Magellan's on our way home through Tracy to have a nice dinner before our teens started school.

We called and made reservations to stop for dinner on our way home from a great day boating on the lake. We arrived with a party of 6 at 7:40 on a Friday evening. We were the biggest party in the restaurant. We were seated immediately by the hostess. She poured us water while we looked at the menus. We had a few questions and her response in an unpleasant tone was "I don't know, I am the hostess".  If you can't answer how about, I AM SORRY you will have to ask your server.

Our waiter came over and asked if we wanted drinks, we said, "no but we were ready to order". He asked again about drinks, we told him we had been out in the sun all day and really just wanted water. The look on his face was one of aggravation.
We pushed again for him to take our orders which he did. This waiter did not crack a smile or pleasant look. Some of us ordered salads which came quickly.

Then almost 50 MINUTES after we ordered with no check-in from our waiter. We sat at our table fading fast and not one word of apologies from anyone. There was another waitress who walked around with a scowl on her face and the hostess looked frustrated as she reset tables.
We heard a bell ring and knew it was our food. Our waiter was making bar drinks for another table and sent the other waitress to start bringing our food. The look on both faces were that of exacerbation. I am not sure what we did to deserve such visibly aggravated staff.

Finally, our meals came, 4 of the 6 meals were similar pasta dishes, one was veal and one was filet. This should not have taken 50 minutes. The food was ok, not anything great after such a wait, not anything I would travel back to have or recommend to others. We finished our meals and were exhausted and ready to go. Our waiter asked about dessert, when we said, "no thank you", he again showed how frustrated he was.. We asked to have food wrapped up, my husband asked for a couple of slices of bread from the table to be added to his box. The hostess was nice enough to fulfill this request. I watched in the open servers area as our waiter approached her and openly showed his frustration that she was slicing bread for the box.

It was a little after 9 pm, we paid our pricey bill with hefty gratuity included because we were a party of 6. At this point the owner was in the dining room talking to guests. He said  to us as we began to depart, "that was fast."
Sir if you think a ticket time of 50 minutes is fast you are sadly mistaken. Had we not had to wait so long we probably would have had a few desserts and coffee.
The staffs disdain just made me feel that I wanted to get out, why would we want to linger with such a negative vibe in the space.

Even the two teens with us knew the wait staff was not treating us like we were paying customers and the service and wait would not be okay on any food network reality show.

We eat out a great deal and have had many kinds of dining experiences. I can't remember a time when 24 hours later I still NEEDED to write a bad yelp review. The owner should visit some of the best restaurants in Livermore or Pleasanton to experience good service, happy staff and delicious food for the same price of Magellan's. Perhaps just watching food network will give you some clues.

Sorry we gave it a try and will not return, we will keep driving next time.</Text>

Requires a full commitment-once you’re in, they don’t let you out financially! Expensive.  Monthly minimum $97, 6 week challenges around 250-300...good trainers, good selection of classes. Wonderful and inspirational environment, trainers do not monitor technique<//text>

The combination of weights and aerobics has enabled me to lose 20 lbs in under 5 weeks. I highly recommend this workout. I would also recommend taking the pre-workout drink and the BCAA drink after working out. I think that has helped as well.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I joined the camp a few months before my wedding and it was life changing . I not only lost weight , I gained muscle , I felt amazing and came out the best shape of my life . The staff was great and always motivated me , even when I didn’t see results as quickly as I had hoped for . The trainers were great and the classes were so fun , definitely challenging but so worth it . I would recommend the camp to anyone serious about making healthy changes to their life , you won’t regret it !</Text>< GmapID>

Always fun but challenging! No one who works out there is pretentious or a show off, but everyone is friendly. The trainers keep us on our toes (or knees or elbows or in a plan position)!<//Text>

<review>Just not for me.  I went for two weeks, let them know it wasn't for me and they didn't offer my money back when I said the group trainers came off too pushy making me uncomfortable in a public space.  $500 for two weeks.

I lost the weight on my own through portion control and cutting out of my lifestyle.</review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>They will not let you change your plan. I was going to do the 6 week challenge but my car broke down so I couldn't afford it. I wanted to switch to the detox and they won't let me. It is not good service.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I am having a good experience with the Contractors License School, the teacher, Luis, is a very good teacher and does a good job at explaining everything. Esmeralda is very kind and whenever I have a question she answers it in a kind manner, she is always there to help me when I have any sort of problem and or question. Thank you, Esmeralda.</text>

Great school,  I highly recommend this place preparation in Anaheim. the staff guided you to the easiest way to understand it simple and they show you step by step everything, you just need to put some effort to succeed because nothing's easy in this life that's what ESMERALDA ACOSTA told me she works there and that motivated me to keep going, thank you so much I really appreciate it ☺️😊<//text>

Great school. Thank you for your help. I went to other schools and they didn't sound too experienced. I saw this one had a lot of ppl passing. I signed up for a painting license with the online classes and did my corporation.<//Review>

<review>I am currently in the process of obtaining my
C-33 Painting and Decorating license.
Just wanted to thank Aldo and the staff at the Anaheim location for there very hard work and helping each and every one of us obtain our license. Aldo takes his time in explaining all the material and answering all our questions.
If your looking to obtain your license in any trade I highly suggest you give them a call. You won’t regret it.<//review><GmapID>0x80dd2997a72aeb93:0xeda0e3868eb7c0cc</GmapID>< user_name>

Aldo the instructor is very knowledgable and will guide you and provide you with any and all information you will need to pass your exams. Rocio and Ana will take care of your paperwork with ease and simplicity so you can focus on studying your exam which is the most important. CSLP of Anaheim is your go to school and you can ensure with your dedication and urgency you'' have your license in hand within 90 Days.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2997a72aeb93:0xeda0e3868eb7c0cc< /Gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) Rocio and Aldo thank you very much for helping me to be able to operate the roofing contractor license. I think the classes were very well given by Aldo and I think that many classmates can also get their license to work legally and safely. And also where you go to work with your forehead up and say that you have a work license and everything is in order again thank you very much and I will gladly give recommendations to new colleagues.

(Original)
Rocio y Aldo muchas gracias por ayudarme a poder opener la licencia de contratista de roofing .

<Review>Stopped there to pick up sandwiches and salads for lunch. There is a good vibe there. The cashier was very welcoming and friendly. We had Cuban Sandwich and tuna salad, all good and reasonably priced. You can eat in at the bar and there is an outdoor sitting area by the side of the restaurant.< /Review>< UserId.>

Great sandwich place to eat at. Always clean, prices are good, with so many options. Build your own or get one of the daily specials, you can’t go wrong. The staff are really nice and super funny who really care about their customers.
I highly recommend this place!< /Text>

Avoid at all cost for takeout and future dining.
Employees handling food with no gloves. Beyond negligent given the standards that all food establishments are asked to comply with.< /review>

Moved to California about a month ago from Chicago and I haven’t been able to find a single restaurant that serves Chicago style Italian beef sandwiches. I called before I came and when I arrived it was exactly what I wanted service was great food was great I will be returning to this establishment.< /review>

Three Pickles on Canon Perdido has so many things going for it besides having the best sandwiches in town. First of all, it has some of the best views in Santa Barbara when you sit in the patio/alley. It's next to the best coffee shop in town, Handlebar. And best of all, the Pickles bar (located in a historic building that once housed an opium den and brothel) has an all star team of bartenders all with different specialties. I find myself there for breakfast, lunch and dinner for drinks! It's a real gem.<//text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>The pickles here are outstanding, and my sandwich was very good, though a bit expensive for not having any meat in it (there is only one vegetarian sandwich on the menu).

<Review>Probably the best sandwich place in town. Decently priced for amazing quality. Staff is always nice. Only downside is parking.</Review>< time>

Best sandwiches in SB! The Goodland Club is my favorite, never disappoints and the meatball is the best meatball sandwich I've ever had.  Don't miss out!<//Review>

The sandwiches are HUGE, I always get a half sandwich and end up asking for it to be cut in half again. The pastrami sandwich (appropriately named the Presidio since it's right across the street from the State Park visitor's center) is my favorite, and the soups are a great pick-me-up on a cold day!

I wish they were open Sundays so I could walk over there during lunch, though.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The Handlebar Coffee Roaster, which is next to each other, and the outdoor table side by side, make the outside feel better than the interior. The sandwiches are not greasy and lighter than people imagined by the photos they posted. My husband ate Meatball, and I ate Reuben, but the processed meat called pastrami from Leuven is sour-kraut (German pickled cabbage), which is well neutralized in terms of taste. Italian Wedding Soup is a complete seaweed soup. It is recommended that you try it. ^^ But you should never eat cucumber pickles that you take by yourself at the store. Weave I just squeeze the garden salad and it tastes bad in my mouth.

(Original)
옆에 나란히 있는 Handlebar Coffee Roaster와 야외 테이블을 나란히 같이 놓고 있어 바깥 분위기가 실내보다 좋다. 샌드위치들은 사람들이 올린 사진을 보며 상상했던 것보다는 기름지지 않고 담백하다. 남편은 미트볼(Meatball)을, 나는 루벤(Reuben)을 먹었는데 루벤에 잔뜩 들은 pastrami라는 가공처리된 고기류를 사우어크라우트(독일식 절인 양배추)가 맛의 측면에서 중화를 잘 시키고 있다. Italian Wedding이란 수프는 완전 미역국이다. 꼭 먹어보라고 권한다.^^ 하지만 가게에서 셀프로 갖다 먹는 오이피클은 절대로 먹지 말아야 한다. 넘넘 짜다. 가든 샐러드도 짜기만 하고 내 입에는 맛이 없다.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQhhgkDdr3c-W3Nls3EWqFgVxkUVHuyaLZYkjk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVdGosfDOdcQRCe_971aoVQq_R5pUmH7Rh-byU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNBnZmZTE1LaAPEcRyCPmQ4vCd3Mh9g7UiYKYS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmL896Dexmar56UKvWYWI61taqHxIAkEU2X85U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) The salad is good, the service is efficient, and the meal can be delivered to the outdoor seating. It is very intimate. There is a bar to drink and watch the game.

(Translated by Google) Delightful restaurant, opposite the Presidium. Very good salads, abundant, fresh and well presented. The guys who run are very kind. Low prices, less than $ 10 each

I've tried a couple of different poké places in the area and I keep coming back here. For the price, what you get is a great deal. The fish is fresher than any other place I've been and they are very generous with their toppings. Next time I'm in town visiting, I will definitely visit Poke & Roll again.<//review>

I'm sorry but I do not like this place at all. It feels super dingy, the poke bowls taste funky and the sushi seems like its from the super market. I don't want to bash a place but I have really have had better!</Review>

I had previously given this place a 5 star review:

Tasty food, AMAZING serving sizes for the price, the highly-coveted “unlimited toppings”, and up until tonight— wonderful staff. However, this evening we had a horrifying experience!!

I jumped into the car as soon as my friend made it over from hollywood and we rushed to make it before closing time, arriving at 8:45pm with 15 minutes to spare. As soon as we walked in we were met with a curt attitude from the young woman behind the counter asking us to “make this quick”. Well, we come here quite often and order the same thing every time... we can’t possibly order faster. But in her unduly extreme sense of urgency, she rushed through our orders and COMPLETELY messed mine up. I asked for a mix of sauces with “just a TINY bit of eel sauce.” And she doused it. There’s no recovery once the sauce is on there. And of course I felt so pressured by her behavior that I didn’t ask for it to be redone (huge regret). I was shocked and commented on the mistake, but she just asked if I wanted any dry toppings. I said “No it’s fine” because I was afraid to interact with the uncomfortable haste, but now there’s about 52 grams of corn syrup my “salad-based” bowl is swimming in.

I’m disgusted, disappointment, and out $17 for a meal I don’t want to touch. As someone who has worked in the service industry, I’m shocked that she in any way feels it was acceptable or appropriate to treat us that way. If this were my first time there I would give it one star and never come back. But like I said, we come often and have openly appreciated the staff other times... so, 3 stars for them.</Text>

Please do not order through Yelp or Grubhub. They don’t get the orders because those accounts aren’t verified. Order through their website, Uber, or Postmates if you really can’t make it in person.< /review>

It was ok, poke wasnt bad but I've had better. The edamame had a weird taste to it. Apart from that, the place seems as though it needs a deep cleaning. Atmosphere wasnt too welcoming either.</Text>

< review>
the fish is warm, gets warmer when added to the rice. house sauce was flavorless and they don't sell rolls anymore? I guess the name just refers to rock & roll at this point. There aren't many places for poke in Whittier but the commoner has a more legit poke. check it out, let me know.< /review>

<text>This place is small and kinda drab.  Go anyway!  The server was really friendly.  Patient and generous, she helped me select poke for 2 other picky eaters.  No seats, so take-out only.  It's in the same center as Jack's diner, so the parking lot is busy on weekends.  My so lived in Hawai'i, and he said places spending more on decor spend less on filling your box with fresh ingredients.  We will go back.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2d39a43bf26b1:0xa406082a4663267d< /gmapID>< rate>

Nice small poke stop, the proportions are really good. The small was enough for me and I was pretty hungry. They also have some good house special-made bowls (combos) that looked really pleasing. This restaurant also offers a variety of different flavored smoothies.<//Review>

This place is pretty good. The quality of the fish is decent. The portion sizes are really good (I got a medium = 3 types of protein). It's a pretty small place (can only seat about 4-5 people). So this likely a good take out option. The service was quick and staff friendly. They do have a unisex restroom. No alcohol. All in all a good local spot.</review>

<Review>Tried this place with my mom after one of my matches, really good! Only thing I'd say is that it's hard to see at night maybe light up the sign or put POKE in more visible letters. Food was very good though.< /Review>< pictures>

Last week was the first time we visited this excellent restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the efficient service, with the superb cooking and wine and with the honest pay. We will absolutely return there soon.< /Review>

A meal per person costs $115 with supplementary grilled Wagyu Beef for an extra $25. They serve around 8 people a day so make a reservation before you come. Food is delicately handmade, but adjusted slightly to fit American tastebuds. The chef himself creates his pickled ingredients from scratch. The imported ingredients from Japan are blended well with the fresh ingredients available locally. My favourite is probably their steamed dish. The menu changes monthly.</Review>

Nice Japanese restaurant with the counter dining experience just like in Japan.  Attentive service.  Quiet elegant dining room.  Artistically presented food and dishes.  They are all tasty.  $100 for the set dinner and it is a nice relaxing meal.< /Text>

What a fabulous dining experience for two hours. Each our little dishes are well presented and absolutely delicious. OzaOza is the only Japanese Restaurant in San Francisco that provide authentic Kaiseki cuisine 会席料理.

Little bit background about Kaiseki cuisine.
There are two kinds of traditional Japanese meal styles called kaiseki . The first, where kaiseki is written as 会席 refers to a set menu of select food served on an individual tray (to each member of a gathering). The second, written as 懐石 refers to the simple meal that the host of a chanoyu gathering serves to the guests before a ceremonial tea.

OzaOza changes menu every month based on the seasonal ingredients.

**2/2019 Menu w/supplemental dish  (some highlights of the set)
Sakizuke (small Appetizer): Love the combination of herring roe, dried squid and yuzu  skin.
Yakimono (Grilled dish):  the miso marinated grilled butterfish are stunning.
Supplemental dish:  The boom,  Waygu beef steak was mind blowing. We glad that we ordered the waygu steak as a brief interlude for our wonderful night.
Sunomono (Vinegared Dish): the best sunomono that the I ever had, the sweet miso- mustard sauce was phenomenal

Drinks:
Plum Wine: Nanbu Baji, very unique taste of the plum wine that OzaOza Provided, it has some sweet osmanthus taste< /Text>

A very unique dining experience which is uncommon to find outside of Japan. Traditional Japanese tasting menu in a very cozy space. Pricey, but well worth it.</text>

Had a lovely dining experience at oza oza.
The French laundry of Japanese cuisine!The courses were amazing--in flavor and presentation.  The atmosphere was warm and every dish was prepared and presented with pure passion and love of the art. The chef and his lovely wife made us feel like we were having dinner in their home.  Beautiful evening...were we in San Francisco or Japan!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This was also my first Kaiseki experience, and it was awesome! All the food was absolutely delicious, with ingredients & preparation methods I hadn't even seen before - and I've eaten a lot of food in my life, haha.

The service was phenomenal, really friendly and not at all pushy, she explained everything very well and it felt very special without being too 'fussy', which is just how I like it.

It was also a great value considering the amount of work & care put into each dish, and the quality of the ingredients - really lovely sashimi for example, including uni from Japan that tasted so light and delicious I think it'd make an uni lover out of anyone. We opted to add the Wagyu beef course for an additional $20, and if you're a beef lover I think it'd be well worth it - it was the most tender beef I'd ever had that still maintained a savory flavor.

Definitely left feeling satisfied in every way, and I'm looking forward to going back again!< /Review>< pics>

<userid>111351154742000609642</userid><Time>1483689619198</Time><Review>This was my first Kaiseki experience like many others and it was amazing. I took my fiancé here for her birthday and it was quite a treat for both of us! From the monk fish to the wagyu, everything was delicately cooked and arranged. Oza Oza is located in between a karaoke bar and a lounge in Japantown, but the inside is perfect. We felt very welcomed by the owners (a husband-wife duo) as well as the other guests next to us. They change the menu periodically (every month I believe) and even though I tried it recently, I'd like to try it again once they update it. Each course is amazing and they give just the right amount so that you are able to eat everything, including the additional wagyu course. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who's looking for a special meal and I'll never feel the same about other Japanese restaurants!<//Review>< resp>

If you like stepping back in time to bold Bob's Big Boy restaurant this is the place to go. Remind you of old time spent with friends and family. Although you may notice there is a Bob's Big Boy statue out front and he is wearing a cowboy hat. We have never seen Bob where cowboy hat or any other hat that matter. But it's a nice change of pace. Modernizes the place. Stop in for a visit.<//text>

<Text>The service was great, we ordered to go and ate on the patio with our small dog. They waited to make our dessert until we were ready. It was clean and nice outside.

This wasy first time back to a Bob's Big Boy in like 15 years. I anticipated the chili spaghetti and was excited to share the experience with our kids. While the noodles were perfectly cooked, everything tasted really bland.

I was surprised when one of my kids, a picky eater, said the french fry he tried was bad. I grabbed it to see what he was talking about and took a bite of his rejection.

It tasted like manure! This ruined my experience completely. I have never had this happen anywhere else.

My wife said afterward that other reviews mention this phenomenon. I cannot recommend you gamble eating here.< /Text>< Name>

This particular location in Norco has the best burgers chicken sandwich and club sandwiches. Fries are perfect. Deserts are great. The service is also very good!</Text>

Had a lovely dinner with my girls. Andrew, our server, was conscientious of our needs during the meal making sure our meals were good, our drinks sufficient, and then dessert! Gotta have the hot fudge cake when we go to Bob's Big Boy! Everything was clean without the odor of constant cleaning.< /Text>

Bob's isn't what it used to be. Bob's big boy was so-so tasting (somewhat  cold), and fries were over cooked (a bit warm). Service wasn't very desirable. Guess it goes with the pandemic times where no one cares anymore.</Review>

<Review>Food was delicious! First time I came here was on Thursday , the 11th of June 2020. I love this style of restaurants. Especially the decor and music. I tried the Super Big Boy. Thankful for the restaurant being open. Waitresses take great care of you. You get your money's worth. Next time I will try the shakes and that's for sure because summer is already here!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkFz02_OaqAO92EijxJeE2gi-nYSE6rPO0fl6i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My grandson just loves coming here to see all the Bob's here.  Especially cowboy Bob. I've been coming to Bob's since I was a child since the 60's. Glad he enjoys the milk shakes and burgers as much as my grandma and I did.</text>

Went on a Saturday afternoon and got right in. The restaurant was not every busy so it was a nice change of not having to wait on a Saturday to eat. Service was fast and all wait staff helped clear our table and run orders which was good to see. Food came out hot and fresh which was great because my wife got breakfast and I ordered lunch which usually leads to poor timing by the kitchen and one of the orders is cold, but that was not an issue here. I will return and recommend this to friends and family.<//text>

<Review>Never even heard of the place but staying in Norco had to try it. Cool little spot! Very friendly staff and atmosphere was cool. Good food as well. I have to be honest I wasn't that impressed with the burger but had some of my friends turkey bacon club and it was really good! I'm sure all the food is really good and would come back again if I'm in the area.</Review>< pics>

Hello, the reason for 3 stars was for our waitress Britney,  she was soo sweet and helpful,  now to the food.. the spaghetti n chilli was horrible, it tasted like Hormel and the spaghetti itself had no taste or texture. It had a very weird aftertaste, it was sour. I had the cajin chicken Alfredo. The chicken was rubbery, the sauce was watery and the noodles were blan... not sure if well come back to this one again, we sure miss the one in burbank... thank you again Brittany for your attention and help.< /Review>

Staff is very friendly my girlfriends steak was excellent. My chili spaghetti  was not so good no seasoning and just bland. The waitress was very apologetic and took care of it. I highly recommend the fried pickles<//review>

I have to be honest I wasn't that impressed with the burger but had some of my friends turkey bacon club and it was really good! I'm sure all the food is really good and would come back again if I'm in the area.< /Review>< name>

Went on a Saturday afternoon and got right in. The restaurant was not every busy so it was a nice change of not having to wait on a Saturday to eat. Service was fast and all wait staff helped clear our table and run orders which was good to see. Food came out hot and fresh which was great because my wife got breakfast and I ordered lunch which usually leads to poor timing by the kitchen and one of the orders is cold, but that was not an issue here. I will return and recommend this to friends and family.</text>

<review>Food was delicious! First time I came here was on Thursday , the 11th of June 2020. I love this style of restaurants. Especially the decor and music. I tried the Super Big Boy. Thankful for the restaurant being open. Waitresses take great care of you. You get your money's worth. Next time I will try the shakes and that's for sure because summer is already here!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkFz02_OaqAO92EijxJeE2gi-nYSE6rPO0fl6i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Staff are always friendly and attentive and food is delish with good prices for good sized portions. Big menu. Try their handmade ice cream shakes! They have a neat little gift shop too with some rare finds. The place is always clean and spotless. Great place for a date or large group gathering. I mean it's Bob's Big Boy!! :) Ever since the one in Diamond Bar closed this is the only one in the area and I'm really glad it's still here. I hope they stay forever, definitely some nostalgia!

Listen... It's decent, simple, chain restaurant food. Nothing fancy. Nothing spectacular. Priced right and low key. Staff are courteous and helpful (and on it with the coffee refills. Thanks Michelle!!)<//Text>

This place brings back memories of my childhood. Chili spaghetti was always my fave back then, but now I can't tear myself away from the Classic Big Boy burger with fries. The season salt is a must have on the fries! Don't forget to save room for dessert, the hot fudge cake is to die for good.< /text>

I'd forgotten. They really are great!!! Also had an order of onion rings for the 1st time & they were also excellent!
A couple of years ago or more a waitress turned me on to the taste sensation of their Blue Cheese dressing with french fries which is my new favorite way to eat them.
You can't go wrong at Bob's Big Boy that's for sure!!!< /review>< pics>

Even during this "pandemic" of 2020, the food is still just as good as it was the last time I ate at a Big Boy (late 70s).<//Review>

Great car show, Bob's big boy special is 12.99 used to be 1.29, haha, but that was in 1961! Friday night special it was 99 cents. The burger is bigger now though.< /text>

Yes!! I've always loved Big Boy's, too bad seems like they're disappearing, even the ones close to me, my whole family have always enjoyed Bob's Big Boy, my parents were regulars there, we even held our little gatherings there in the city of industry, now I travel from Victorville to Norco or at times when it was open to Calimesa,<//text>

< review>
After a few months of Stay At Home, I decided to venture out to the Bob's Big Boy in Norco.   I am fan of Big Boy's Hamburger since I was about 5 - 6 years old.     I was born and raised in Pasadena.  My parents would go to the Bob's Big Boy on Colorado.  We either ate in the small take out patio or took the burgers home.   Pasadena did have 3 Bob's Big Boy.     Two on Colorado Blvd. and 1 on Lake Ave.   I do miss them.  Even the ones in Barstow, CA are closed now.  There is only 3 left here.  The original in Burbank, CA, Downey, CA and Norco, CA.

We drove down to Norco for lunch.   I called ahead to make sure they have dine-in service.  They do have dine-in service.  We were greeted by the host and seated right away.  The waitress was very courteous, attentive and very friendly.

She took our drink orders and we were ready to order.  I had their Big Boy combo (regular size) not the jumbo size one.

Salad was fresh.  The burger came with fries.   I truly enjoyed the Big Boy hamburger.  It's been a while since I ate one too.

The server kept on coming back making sure drinks were filled and making sure we were happy with food.

I would recommend this place.   Very close to the freeway too.

I would go back to Bob's Big Boy again.<//review>

<Review>Stopped in for dinner Sunday night about 5:00, not busy, Very bad service.  waitress was more interested in talking to co-workers then doing her job. We noticed other waitress doing the same, Shows the manger is not doing his/her job. Could not follow the simplest things like cutting hamburger in half for elderly, refilling drinks,  getting desert order in timely fashion< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>We went for the breakfast buffet. We got are first plate and there was some food. But when we went to get are second plate we   had to wait for food to be put in buffet. The waitress had to let the manager know that food wasn't out.  Other people came in wanted buffet and had to also ask when the buffet would be refilled. And then I saw a waiter throw a potato back in the container that was sitting on the side of the counter. It took a few minutes and the the manager was helping to bring out more food for the buffet. Probably never go back there for the buffet.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1576354306556< /Time>< GmapID>

<username>Scott<//username><date>1561518245394<//date><rating>3<//rating><Text>Okay. Now this place is iconic in SoCal and I haven't been to a big boy in close to 30 years. I saw a sign off the 15 freeway and said..Dang! Gotta stop and get a burger. I did and well it was much better in memory than it was today. The burger was similar to the big mac, when I was hoping for something different and was missing the seasoning. I know I know salt is bad... but my gosh it's good on meet when cooking. So basically it was missing the taste I was hoping for from my childhood memory. The fries were great as was the salad with Bob's ranch dressing.  The service from the folks working was fantastic and the restaurant itself was classic old time comfort.  I will be back to try something else on the menu as I saw a number of items that looked good. I will update one I try something else.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

First time in 30 years, and it was such a great decision.

The Turkey bacon sandwich is amazing!
The bread was hot, the turkey was grilled, the lettuce and tomato was cold.
Perfect.

I thought there were no more Big Boys around. But there is. Yeah! I love the Bob's Big Boy hamburger. And the hot fudge cake YUMMY. They gave it to me free for my birthday. Reminded me of my childhood.< /Text>

Came in for take out. Staff offered to have us sit in patio area to eat. Food was taste less and barely warm. I was very unhappy with our meals. Tables were dirty, door handles flippen filthy with grime.  Spent alot of money to support this business during this  time and food was not ok. Staff was friendly.< /text>

<text>Stopped by for a quick Big Boy combo and it was just as we remembered it ... soft bun, fresh ingredients,  excellent fries! Service was quick & efficient, too. Couldn't take time for dessert, though ... our loss. The Strawberry pie and/or hot fudge cake are to die for! Keep up the good work!< /text>< pictures>

My husband and I went here for our first time. He ordered the Double Cheeseburger and I had the Jack Avocado Omelette, however, they have failed me. My Omelette tasted like plastic and the cheeseburger was cold. On the other hand, the fries were good and crispy. Service was average. Would have prefer In-N-Out, at least everything would be fresh and hot.< /Review>

Honestly, despite all I'd heard about this place, my burger was incredibly dry and I could barely finish half of it before feeling like it was just too much grease. On top of that, our waitress essentially made me feel bad for not eating it on two separate stops at our table. The pickle fries were great, but I kinda wish I'd just gone for the breakfast bar.<//Review>

It's always been my favorite burger and it was as good as I remember it to be! It's nice that there are a few of these restaurants left to enjoy. Amazing how many wonderful memories are connected to a burger. Memories that go back to the 1950's. Great food, service and memories.</review>

Would have prefer In-N-Out, at least everything would be fresh and hot.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good Server, Good meal. Food well prepared. Had Turkey Club Sandwich. Apple Pie with Ice Cream dessert was also tasty. Meal came out pretty quick. I think prices a little high.<//review>

The buffet was old food that should not have been served after 11am.  We came in at 1pm and was told that the food was fresh.  That was not the case.  I love boys since I was a child but this had to be my worst nightmare of a meal.  The hot cocoa tasted liked water, the potatoes were dried out and the eggs were cold. Only thing good was the salad bar.  Next time I will be ordering my food from the menu.</review>

Clean place with a typically friendly staff that brings back memories of my childhood, since we visited Bob's a lot back then. My favorites are the patty melt and the Ruben. Generally,  the service has been fast and the food has been fresh. I do recall one meal that took a while to arrive and some of it was no longer warm. To be fair, when we complained, they went and reheated it. Thus is why I gave them 4 stars.</Review>

<review>Burgers were nothing special and fries were just gross. They were not crunchy, just very chewy. Decided to order dessert and asked for fudge brownie and ice cream. The "brownie" was literally plain brown bread with old tasting fudge and had vanilla Ice cream with hidden pieces of ice in it. I would skip this place if you're looking to actually enjoy your meal.<//review><UserId.>100868005320289867634</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0<//Gmap_id><Name>Stephanie</Name><date>1554076332202</date><Rating>1< /Rating><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

If I could put a 0 star I would. Service was horrible. The server gave me grilled garlic roll instead of French fries. My wife and I ordered the shrimp fajita and steak. My steak was cooked ok but my wife's steak was overcooked. There was only 2 female elderly servers and a male busser. I have served for many years and I have never experienced such horrible service. Rant over< /Review>

Nothing spectacular about our visit. I've never had bad service here. Food came out as ordered and was delicious. Waitress was a little slow getting us utensils so we used a pocket knife to cut the burgers but otherwise, a good visit.</review>

<Text>We went for a hot fudge cake and we were not disappointed! The service was great and the dessert was delicious. There was no wait. Not too many people inside.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Love Bobs. Whoa, careful how you read that. I love those too but that's a different review. I have been going to Bob's (Burbank) since before I was born. This was my mom's pregnant craving. I live the Big Boy combo with blue cheese and always get a side of tomatoes relish to add to my burger. The fried chicken is super yummy too. Great place for casual family dining and good food that won't break the bank.< /text><Date>1550676937890<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>The service was on par for a restaurant. We showed up late morning and they offered a breakfast buffet. We opted to order from the menu to get something a bit more fresh. Scrambled eggs, hash browns, pancakes, french toast, etc. My scrambled eggs were undercooked and the pancakes were reheated in the microwave, you can tell because dough gets a rubber consistency when it's overly reheated in the microwave. The hash browns were super greasy. Nice people, but I don't think we'll be back.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Burgers,  stuffed potato pancakes,  chili spaghetti  are all highlights.  Frequent classic car shows in the parking lot. Great diner food.  Nostalgic SoCal chain.  Fun, cheerful waitresses.< /text>

Brings back the memories!  You know what you're getting here if you've been to one in your past.  Good food with historic flavors.  Wonderful shakes.  Great desserts.  The full on Big Boy experience.  Glad we ran across this place!  Will be back when in the area.</Review>

I went hear for breakfast and was presently surprised to find a really good selection of items.  They even had potato pancakes which I ordered.  They even had a solid breakfast buffet for about $13.
The selection was the win, the problem was everything we tried was only okay at best.  I was hoping for so much more.
The price was right the taste was alright at best.<//text>

<review>I'm amazed. How does Bob's Big Boy make consistently great burgers every time you come in. Year after year after year. I've been eating Big Boy hamburgers for over 60 years now and they're just as good as the first time I tried one. Amazing. The best hamburger in Southern California. Maybe the whole world.</review><Name>Gifford Claiborne< /Name></record>

<Text>Best burgers we have had in a while. It was great making a burger the way we like it...with the different topping available. The salad bar looked great for next time.

<Text>I will never return to this restaurant. I was served a burger on a moldy bun. I then ordered a short stack of pancakes. I was served two pancakes that were about an 1/8" thick, really I mean wafer thin! They tasted like they were cooked on a dirty grill. To my surprise, I was charged $7.00 for said pancakes. The manager was too busy to be bothered to come address us personally. The cashier did however discount my ticket a few dollars. Bottom line, a good manager would have come to the table and apologized. Further more, the entire check should have been free because that is what great customer service about. What an absolute joke of an establishment. AVOID THIS PLACE!</Text>< pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><Name>Mary Jane</Name><Time>1550109524492</Time><Review>Waitress and hostess were very nice, but she was the only one on the floor so when we needed something else or extra, it was a bit annoying trying to get her attention.  We did though get the older lady who I think was the hostess,  and she definitely took care of what we needed immediately. Bob's big boy just doesn't taste the same as it used to. I think that will be our last visit there. We had to search another table for their seasoning salt. As a customer,  I think its important to make sure all items are on the table before being seated so when our food gets to the table, we can eat instead of looking around for something that is missing. We dined around 4pm and there were maybe one other table eating as we were being seated.<//Review>< user>

<Review>Bob's Big Boy. this is a really old Drive-In style restaurant that has like a Denny's menu basically burgers and Sandwiches and Such it's not bad but they have pretty much everything that everyone else has what I liked best was the service The Waitresses there are super helpful and attend to your needs so the service will keep me coming back even though the burgers are just a regular hamburger with cheese and what they call Red relish which is what I call ketchup. all in all it wasn't bad.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None< /resp><name>Pit bull Lover< /name><date>1574490179035< /date><Text>You know it's a shame for all the take-out dinners that we have had from Bob's big boy from all the dinners that we have eaten in restaurant at Bob's big boy tonight the order is very pathetic their quality is going down apparently they prefer profit over quality and satisfied customers. Apparently when Marie callender's closed their restaurant in Corona Bob's big boy Norco figures that they can slack and they won't lose any business to the competition little did they know but Bob's big boy Norco is losing business. We have ordered the same takeout dinners from this restaurant a few times and tonight it got to the point where I just had to post a review on Yelp and now on Google.  Unfortunately it's not a good one and it is their own fault from the manager down to that blond pretty boy they have taking the order behind the counter. I ordered a Cobb salad and usually it would fill the takeout container here is the picture of what we got for a Cobb salad there is no Roquefort cheese on it,  there is no egg on it all it is is basically lettuce some turkey shredded bits a ton of bacon bits and a quarter of an avocado and I had to ask for more Italian dressing. As far as the chicken-fried steak goes or country fried steak whatever they call it.  When we would order a mashed potato as a side they would give you two scoops plus a cup of mashed potatoes now they say when you order the potato on the side it's just the scoop of potatoes I guess it depends on who is cooking in the kitchen that night. (I can't call them a chef because they do not act or perform as a chef) with a fruit cup as you can see they give you a quarter of the cup and cantaloupe that has the Rhine on it which is green and a lot of grapes. I ordered mine with the cottage cheese he gave me a little cup of cottage cheese the size that the dressing would be in for the cobb salad I had to make them go back and put it in a normal sized container like what they used to do all in all Bob's big boy Norco has lost another customer I would definitely drive the extra 17 miles up to Riverside to Marie callender's on the corner of Merrill avenue and Riverside avenue right behind the Riverside plaza and next door to market broiler which by the way has excellent fish oh my gosh it is to die for, but I digress the location is perfect because Christmas is coming and we can go shopping at the Riverside plaza and then go to Marie callender's and have a very nice dinner with a slice of pie of course who does not like Marie callender pies for Thanksgiving ?  so really we're killing two birds with one stone to coin a phrase. You know my grandparents and my aunt and uncle that used to go to Bob's big boy all the time would be rolling over in their graves about now.  This is pathetic so long Bob it's been fun but like they say all good things must come to an end and you've definitely proven it.<//Text></record>

Fish dinner 2 small pieces of fish fries and slaw which was fine, except used to be 3 peieces of fish for ?10.99. Now its ?13.99 for 2 small pieces of fish. No wonder there business has gone down so badly.< /Text>< rate>

I took 2 kids, a teenager, and one adult. All three kids loved everything they tried (except the 5 year old with the adults food). Great service during a busy part of the day. Walked out with a $45 bill and the 2 kids are almost sleeping. Plenty of food for all and both adults are happy.< /text>

<Text>Pretty good food for the price and not as crowded as some other places. We haven't tried the buffet so I can't comment on that. The only issue we've had is some of the service has been poor and unprofessional. The waitresses seem nice, but the cashier we've had twice now was rude and standoffish after ignoring us and we were really nice to her. I find this to be common in this area though, for some reason. Everything else was good. We have breakfast here now and then. Good family place.</Text><time>1521596617618<//time>< username>

Like actual burgers no thin ass patties on a diet engulfed by a bun. The mouthwatering meaty magicalness was magnificence incarnate.  Customer service here is also on point. Get here.

<Text>Bob's Big Boy tastes exactly as it did as far as I can remember. Excellent! The burgers were fresh the meat was cooked just right and the fries were crunchy and amazing! The drive to NorCal is so beautiful, very patriotic I love how they have the red white and blue stripes on some of the streets, so American I love it! Highly recommended!<//Text>< Pics>

This is a great place to eat a breakfast buffet. It's always refreshing to walk into a restaurant and find a grade A from the health department in the front window. Great job people! My favorite place in Norco to eat even though I'm only here once every 5 months! Debra from Crest Ridge Saddlery!!!<//Text>

<Text>Husband got the cheeseburger said it didn't taste very good, my mother in law got the tilapia with vegetables and mashed potatoes. She liked it but I had a bite and it was not fresh and the veggies looked brown. I had the chili cheese fries. If I would've known that they put that canned nacho cheese stuff on it I would not have ordered it. It was way to spicy for me.< /Text>< pics>

Terrible service with sub par over priced ice cream. 0 out of 10 would not recommend. As a fellow ice cream scooper this is a disgrace to our title. These employee's are sticking a bad name on the ice cream parlor name. If google gave me the choice I would give this restaurant zero stars out of 5. I first walked into the restaurant and first noticed that they were more about selling gift shop items than the food itself, after about 15 minutes of waiting to be sat in a half empty restaurant a server finally stood up and sat us down. The server took and absurd amount of time to check on her other tables and by the time our table got ordered I could have probably just driven back home( and I live in Utah!!!). You also can't forget that the person dishing the ice cream was a complete amateur smashing the ice cream and packing it in the glass(no longer creamy but more giving it the taste of freezer burn) to also(no surprise) forget to stick the hot fudge and the hot fudge sundae!!! YOU LITERALLY HAVE ONE JOB AND CAN'T EVEN SCOOP HOT FUDGE ONTO A FREAKIN' HOT FUDGE SUNDAE. I also can't get passed the fact that I payed over $4 for this pathetic excuse of ice cream. I'm not surprised by the fact that the it was almost empty when we walked in. You can also tell the effort of a location by the cleanliness of the restrooms, don't even make me go there, The ice cream was bad enough. Who ever the manager is needs to get a grip on that place and teach some server etiquette. CUSTOMERS ALWAYS COME FIRST AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT AN ETERNITY TO GET A SCOOP OF ICE CREAM. The only good thing that happened inside of this restaurant was that the cashier didn't even bother ask for a tip CAUSE HE KNEW NO ONE IN THAT RESTAURANT DESERVED A TIP, LET ALONE MINIMUM WAGE.< /review>

Tracy was very attentive, however when ordering a hot fudge cake, she asked another worker if she would mind making it... Her reply was " well I'm not off, I guess I'll have to make it"... didn't seem like she really cared to be here. Another employee that was talking about going to a reception to that same worker was dragging a pair of worn sandals all over the food counter... I won't be coming back< /text>

I had a loaded bowl of chili beans and garlic bread it was delicious a company with ultimate fudge brownie. The novelty of the place was as cool as I remember it. If you're ever in the area off the 15 Corona and Norco and you want a quick bite to eat I recommend stopping in...<//review>

I wonder why they dont get more business. Could be they can be a bit pricey for burgers but the atmosphere is nice. My only complaint was the salad bar. There wasnt any iceberg lettuce i had to ask for more and wait for it. An all you can eat salad bar should always be stocked. The guy at the entrance was very friendly. The waitress was too but we had to ask for a few things and her face looked a bit overwhelmed at one point. Its ok to feel youve got too much going on but as a waitress you cant be showing that in front of the customers.</review></record>

<Text>First time ever coming to Bob's Big Boy, it was amazing! The food was delicious and i wish i saved room for dessert. Our waitress Racheal was awesome! Very kind and attentive. She was taking care of our table and 3 others... Plus a LARGE party! She really was on top of everything. Great Job Bob!!< /Text>< Response>

Nice flash back to the old days and good Bobs Big Boy burgers. They did a good job making this restaurant. This City had a Bob's Big Boy here in the 80s and is Happy to have one back. Its comfortable and the food is good.</Review>

The food is good don't get me wrong but every time I get salad bar dinner lunch or breakfast I get sick!! I really don't think they check anything once they've put it there. It just stays there for hours on a warmer. Yesterday all I are was a bowl of soup and a salad and the toilet was my best friend the rest of the night. No more salad bar for me. DON'T GO TO THE SALAD BAR!</Review>

We hadn't been to Bob's in a loong time since they don't have many around. So, since we were unfamiliar with the area we looked up what was around. As soon as my husband saw Bob's Big Boy there was no more search! The food and the service was great and the restaurant clean.<//Review>

<Review>The food was awful. I ordered a steak with shrimp and mashed potatoes. The shrimp was okay, but the steak had absolutely no flavor. It just tasted like water. The potatoes were obviously fake, but they didn't even taste as good as normal instant potatoes. It was disgusting and I will never go back. My server was very nice though, she took back the food and had it removed from the bill with no arguments or snooty comments.< /Review>< userid>

Waiters are great and soup and salad bar were very fresh today 6-18-17. Sometimes I have went soup and salad bar weren't fresh. It's sometimes a hit and miss. Overall, nice relaxing atmosphere for dinner or special occasion.<//Text>

Normally pretty tasty, last time was a bit of a disappointment. Buns were past the freshness date on the edge of stale. The whole combo plate, especially the fries, was pretty dry. Not a good day for a Bob's lunch.<//review>

The people who work there are so nice, always busy. Offers a military discount. But today the chicken was dry and the burgers had no taste. Will go back though cause it's Bob's. And the only one nearby.</Text>

We were excited to go to Bob's burgers for the first time. Then the waitress Grace came to our table and she was so rude she didn't let my husband finish ordering wen she tried to make it seem like we were both dumb. Then when our order was ready she jus looked at me didn't say a word slammed my plates on the table jus said oh and walked away. Not satisfied with the service given after being so exited to visit this resturaunt☹️<//Text>

Yay!  This Bob's Big Boy is the original!  I've come here for years to eat and check out all of the radical vehicles on Classic Car Night, Fridays starting around 4pm.  Great shakes and a good set of options for vegetarians as well as meat eaters!<//Review>

Always go for the Super Big Boy burger or the Big Boy burger.

P.S. If your going for desert, go for a malt, it's practically you buy 1 and get 1 free cause they bring you your malt in its glass and they bring you the left over part of your malt which fills up your whole glass.< /review>

This is difficult to write because I drive 2 hours to come here and it's usually yummy yum yum. I came here the second week of July and it was horrible.
I am here today and it's just as bad. Have they changed the Big Boy burger? Something isn't right. Yuck. Not worth the drive for me if it stays like this.  And I am a fan of Bobs. Blech. The waitress was very nice though. Youngish, pretty, dark hair. The cashier asked me about it. I don't know. It just doesn't taste good.< /text>

< Review>
Going here is hit and miss. Food is ok but service is not that good. Last visit waited 20 minutes for the server to greet us at the table after being seated and take a drink order or whatever. Got tired of waiting and left. Was not that crowded to explain a 20 min wait for a server after being seated.< /Review>

The classic meals are all from frozen. No hand made burgers here. Frozen fish, frozen chicken... The only thing not frozen is their salads. The Mexican chicken salad was good, but the spicy salsa dressing left a lit to be desired.<//Review>

I've been coming to Bob's Big Boy since I was a small kid and we still make special trips out of our way to eat here. This is my favorite burger (sorry In-n-Out!)  I have ONLY had the Big Boy Classic Burger and their Fudge Cake dessert...EVER, so can't attest to their other food offerings, but they have a small salad bar and a large menu. You can get your drinks made with Vanilla or Cherry. They serve Pepsi products unfortunately...sad.
I just know this is comfort food for me! They have a 50's vibe inside with booths and tables in red, white and blue decor.   Service is fast and great most of the time.  They sometimes have Car Shows in there large parking lot.  There is a " Malt and Ice Cream Shoppe" inside the restaurant with a small gift shop selling cookies, candy T-Shirts and gifts.  This is "Americana" modernized!
Did you know that the Bob's Big Boy statue which stands outside the Norco restaurant, is the only one to have their " Bob's mascot" altered? They received special permission to add the cowboy hat on Bob!  Norco is "Horsetown USA" where the horses outnumber the people.< /Text>

<Text>I feel like this place is more about the hype than it is about the taste. My food was rather bland but at least the service was really good. It was possible it was just the day I went but I don't know if I'll go back.<//Text><Date>1511285231563< /Date><user>112371243961229881649<//user><Name>Mattie Triesthings</Name>< rate>

Good Classic American restaurant, the food selection is so tasty I would like 1 of each so I try to eat something different everytime. However their Chilli Spaghetti is by far MY Favorite dish, the kind u order 1 for here & 1 for lunch, I highly recommend it if you like eating pasta.< /review>

Waitress was awesome!  Had all you can eat breakfast...  bacon is really good..  better than any all you can eat i have ever been to.  But biscuits were hard and dry.  But i love a server that keeps your drinks filled and monitors but doesnt interupt.</Review>

<review>In ancient times, Bob's Big Boy restaurants herds roamed the plains in abundance.
Then came the dark times when evil corporations ran the chain into the ground.
Today there are few remaining Bob's Big Boys left in the wild. The iconic Big Boy combo with the Bleu Cheese dressing of my childhood is now a rarity as stores in Diamond Bar close.  There are only a handful of stores left. This store was not crowded on a Saturday night, which makes me worry about its future. I'm sure the original Toluca Lake store will be around forever...but please people, visit all the stores so that you and your progeny can experience an American classic.< /review><gmapID>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0<//gmapID>< response>

< Review>
Came here after a long day of shopping for Christmas. The staff was great, but it took over an hour to get our food and honestly, it wasn't that busy. The food was decent, bit not worth the hour long wait. Would go back, but not after a long day.</Review>

Been here twice in the past 3 months or so and walked out somewhat unimpressed each each time. Food's decent enough don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't go any better than just decent. Service has seemed a tad slow the times I've been where and it seems a bit pricy for the portion size and food quality I've experienced. Bottom line: Not bad, but there's definitely better food nearby for the price.<//Review>

<time>1526183665508</time><review>In ancient times, Bob's Big Boy restaurants herds roamed the plains in abundance.
Then came the dark times when evil corporations ran the chain into the ground.
Today there are few remaining Bob's Big Boys left in the wild. The iconic Big Boy combo with the Bleu Cheese dressing of my childhood is now a rarity as stores in Diamond Bar close.  There are only a handful of stores left. This store was not crowded on a Saturday night, which makes me worry about its future. I'm sure the original Toluca Lake store will be around forever...but please people, visit all the stores so that you and your progeny can experience an American classic.</review><GmapID>0x80dcc9e418783719:0x68fa77f84e702fa0<//GmapID><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

Place is still great to get the Bob's big boy.  My only complaint is the owner has decided to use thin thin patties.  That part is unacceptable to me and the founder.  What a disgrace to Bob.< /text>

Terrible food, good service.  Don't go for nostalgia's sake. We used to go when we were in high school and college, but the big boy burger was nowhere near what it used to be.  Boo hoo.< /text>

<Text>BIG BOY HAMBURGERS WE HERE BEFORE THE BIG MAC. THE BIG BOY CLASSIC BURGER HAS A TASTE OF IT'S OWN, AND I LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE COMMON "BIG MAC". I ORDER THE BIG BOY COMBO (EXTRA RELISH ON THE BURGER IS A MUST)  THE COMBO COMES WITH FRIES AND I ORDER A  A SIDE OF BLUE CHEESE DRESSING DIP THE FRENCH FRIES. MMMM LOVE IT . WISH ONE WAS CLOSER TO MY HOUSE. I HAVE TO DRIVE APROX 35 MILES. BUT IT'S WORTH IT.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>The wait for food was long, the food was standard food nothing special, except my dad really loved their special red relish they put on the big boy burger.

Don't go there at lunch if you have limitrd time.  The service was real slow.  Pretty bad when you just order a hamburger and fries, then you see other tables that were sat after you, getting there food before yours.  Then when the fodd finally came it was cold.  If time isn't an issue, have at it.</text>

I was really disappointed that a burger place had such lame milkshakes. The pasta was terrible but that was my fault for ordering spaghetti at a burger joint.<//Text>

Can count on Bob's to give me my burger fix whenever I need it. Rachel is a great and attentive server and of course you can't go wrong with a Super Big Boy combo and chocolate shake.< /text>

<Text>Bob's 40-plus years ago ,till they most closed were a family treat . Stopped at Norco location , got a Big Boy burger and Dr Pepper soda , why cannot the cooks have the pride to put the relish on the bun , so you get some with each bite . Soda tasted like cough syrup . Very sad .<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Bob's 40-plus years ago ,till they most closed were a family treat . Stopped at Norco location , got a Big Boy burger and Dr Pepper soda , why cannot the cooks have the pride to put the relish on the bun , so you get some with each bite . Soda tasted like cough syrup . Very sad .<//Text>
