Got the vegetable a la carte and pad thai with egg rolls. Would recommend the vegetable dish and egg rolls if you stop here, they have a lot of flavor. Aside from that, they are always on time with food for deliveries and everyone there is very quick and friendly :)<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I LOVE THIS THAI FOOD PLACE. I order it on door dash all the time and it’s ALWAYS delicious and fresh. So far I’ve tried the fried rice, pad Thai, orange chicken, tempura shrimp, egg rolls and some others. The orange chicken is SUPER GOOD it’s obviously made fresh and with real oranges it’s nice tangy and crispy. I don’t get the fake chicken feeling when I eat here like when I eat at other cheap Asian takeout places. Even though it’s cheap it’s really good and authentic. They also have a very good jasmine rice.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Best service I've ever had at a restaurant. I was about to finish my smoothie(which was fantastic) and the waiter gave me water before I even asked, and was super on top of refilling it.

The food is incredible. The prices are $8.95 for a typical Thai plate and $14 for the Boonsee specials. I had the spicy salmon special and it was so good. Savory and full of flavor. The orange chicken is also really good, it's sweet. There was also a fantastic dessert, I forgot the name of it but it was coconut rice served with mangos.

Great place to come with friends or family. I will definitely be coming back and I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for Thai food or just great food.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>GO TO LITTLE BUDDHA THAI KITCHEN in Eastvale, will never order from here again, yesterday we called in an order and then went directly to pick it up, she gave me a big paper bag, which was stapled closed on the top, with the printed itemized receipt stapled also, so i assumed that everything with in there, and i paid by debit and left a $5 tip since its been tough for many out there, so when we got home, we waited about 30mins, and started taking out the containers out of the bag and started serving our plates, about 10 mins into dinner, i thought how we ordered alot of food, but then realized oh wait, i dont see the chicken pad-thai, so i decided to call them before it got to late, (and it has happened before through doordash), we spoke with a lady and told them that they did t include our chicken pad thai, and she said oh it was in another bag, and the bag isnt here anymore, and my wife said while on speaker that she only gave me the one bag, it i was pretty fuming while hearing this, so i said aloud she only gave me the one bag, she never gave me 2 bags, and its like why would there be 7 dishes in one big full paperbag and then just the pad thai in another bag, so she says well someone must of taken it by accident, and i said out loud, well she never tried to even give me 2 bags, so she must of given it away before hand, then she said ok do you want to come back and  pick it up, and we said no, because it is about 15 mins from us she finally says she will refund us, then they called me about and hour or more later and the lady was nice and said that she was sorry, and that instead of charging us $59.54, she would charge us $40 something, so i figured it would be the price minus the pad-thai, and i said ok great thank you, yeah it was a big full bag and i noticed that the pad thai wasnt in there, and so i thought that would be it, but then i check my account today, and i see that they refunded me $5.82, its like wow really, so that means that they probably saw the $5.00 tip that i left and added that to the $5.82, to equal the price of the dish owed to me, but i guess not, instead of issuing me a full refund for the pad thai, they just added my $5.00 tip to the $5.82 that they refunded me, so thats pretty shady, i just thought that well maybe, just maybe, they would refund us the full amount, and not cash the $5 tip also, since they really didnt deserve the tip since they messed up the order, not us, and this isnt the first time, several months ago, i ordered from them through doordash, and they didnt include an item, and by the time we got the delivery they were closed, so when i tried to call then no one answered, and i had only used doordash a few times before hand, so i didnt know where the option was for forgotten item, so i didnt get my money back then also, so now i just wont go to them anymore, they disappointed us for the last time, and Little Buddha Thai Kitchen off Pats Ranch is actually a better quality food, less greasy and oily, they are so much better that we tried calling them first, but the line was busy, wish we would have kept trying, they probably would have gotten the order correct!! lol now<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Wow I can't believe we have been coming here for 2 years already. I can't say enough good things about this place. We drive a bit out of our way but it is worth it one hundred percent! Their food is great, I have tried a variety and everything is really good! My favorites are their pad Thai, spicy glass noodle, and pad see ew but their other dishes are really good. My husband is obsessed with their wings and spicy basil fried rice. When we come to pick up the food or eat in the restaurant the employees are always so nice. We are always glad we went there. Thank you!!!<//Text>< pics>

I just discovered this restaurant recently. The food seems authentic and made fresh, with great ingredients. I give it 4 stars because I've tried about 6 of their dishes now and some are better than others, but overall, I like it very much and you always get service with a smile. 😃<//review>

In my opinion, there are only two really delicious Thai food restaurant. This is one of them. They have the typical Thai menu, but their flavor profile stands out. Did I mention the price?... Economical. And they also deliver through Doordash.<//Review>

The egg rolls are awesome! The wonton soup is amazing as well. I've had the chow mien as well as the pad Thai. Each one was delicious. My wife has had the teriyaki salmon and the king pao chicken. Both were excellent, and she's a bit harder to please. Overall, great food!</Text>

We starting going here for the Crying Tiger dish. This was the only Thai Food location that we could find that offered the dish. We've discovered that almost every dish is exceptional over our 2 dozen + trips. On our most recent visit we tried the Pad Thai and my wife agreed it was the best we've had. It was well balanced without an over bearing amount of peanuts or peanut sauce as many locations are prone to doing.

Each of their curry dishes are consistently good and their massaman curry is very good.

If highly recommend a visit if you are in the area.< /Text>

<review>This is a local favorite for my husband and I.  Atmosphere is quite, food is excellent, staff is attentive.  Physical restaurant is a bit older, so if you want a super nice, upper class, atmosphere this would not be the place.  Prices are reasonable.  I highly recommend this place for dinner or take out.  They also have a nice lunch menu.</review><rating>4</rating><response>None< /response></record>

This place was very very good when I first started going there I don't know what happened new chef or what but the food is not the same.  I ordered a seafood Dish One Time got sick as a dog but I believe in second chances went back sorry they did not redeem themselves so sorry to say that was my last time going but please feel free to stop by and make your own opinion maybe they just had two bad days</Review>

The staff not very  attentive  to their  dining I customers, they seemed more focused  on the people picking up orders for grub hub,door dash,etc. We tried their pad thai and its was ok, their bbq beef ribs were delicious,  and their beef panang did not have a lot of taste.  I'm don't think we will ne going back.</Text>

Attentive service, great food, and comfortable seating. Typical of Thai places, very spicy at most places is considered medium spicy here. You have been warned.</Review>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I went to pick up an order and arrived around min before the order was supposed to be ready. They told me ten minutes, ok that’s fine. Then I kept seeing people come and pick up bigger orders after I got there. Ten minutes turned to forty five and every time I tried to ask them what was going on they would ignore me. Like I was invisible. Eventually I started getting stern and they told me they were working on it, it would be done soon. So I kept waiting. Again I would see people come in, show them the order on their phone and leave. THEN, the guy comes out and says someone already picked up the order. How? If I’ve seen you check everyone’s order confirmation everytime they pick someone up? “The order was picked up” even though I showed them the order confirmation they refused to remake it. Never again. Money and time down the drain</review>

I had an order for a delivery and it was not ready on time and the food containers spilled in my bags. And the client tore a few of my bags. Not a professional  look at all.< /Review>

<review>Great veggie options with delicious mock meat made of mung dal (lentil). Panang curry, eggplant with tofu, massaman curry, and tom yum tofu were all excellent with authentic flavors. Staff/owners are very friendly and helpful also!  One time our Groupon wouldn't work because the site was down but they gave us credit for next time. Highly recommend!< /review>< pics>

Good food. Their PAD THAI is really good.  You can tell if a Thai restaurant is good according to their Pad Thai.  I have gone to other Thai restaurants where this dish was too sweet and had too much sauce.  At Boonsee they make it just right.

Their Green Curry with eggplant and chicken is another of my favorite dishes.  I order at least once a week.

Friendly service and great food.  My favorite Thai restaurant and now they are open in Norco, YEA!!  I used to go to the one in Rancho Cucamonga, but this one is closer to me.<//Review>

I've eaten Thai food all over the United States, this is by far the best place I've been to. It's made fresh, the minute you order it. The Panang Curry was soooooo good. And you get a lot for a good price. Will definitely be coming back here. Oo and they deliver!< /text>

I enjoy eating at this place. They also deliver when the food arrives its so hot and fresh! Their tom kah is yummy. My only complaint is to much meat. Last time I ordered it with tofu and it was great! Their pad Thai is yummy! Their pineapple fried rice is one of my favorites!!! Their pineapple curry is also super yummy! Their appetizers are also all yummy their golden tofu is always good. Sticky rice with mango is also very good. The only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is their tv is kind of loud and I'm sick of every resturant having a tv. We are there to eat not watch tv! But that will not stop me from going here as its yummy local Thai food that delivers and is also just a short drive with comfortable booths and good service.< /review>

<Review>I've been on the biggest Thai binge lately and this place has totally come in handy lol

Not only are they one of the few places (other then pizza) that delivers food to the border of Eastvale ..... they happen to be cheap, fast and taste delicious.

I always get the prix king with beef and my girl always gets the pad Thai with beef and yellow curry .... it always comes to my door piping hot and tasting amazing.

Can't beat this place in the Norco/Eastvale area</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Back in 2018 I went there for pain in my teeth and they wanted to refer me down south, to a dentist office that would take my insurance. That was after they had taken my x-rays. All that was needed was 3 root canals and and a few crowns.  I ended up going to Grace Dental of Modesto, since it was a lot closer. They were happy to take the $22,000 my insurance covered, No problem.<//Text>

I use to like this place when the male dentist was working their. He was so nice and personable, don’t get me wrong the new dentist is nice but it doesn’t seem like she knows her practice. She Missed diagnosed me with 18 cavities and 3 root canals. I told her how I don’t trust dentist and I get anxiety. She refused me service because of the questions we were asking like was she qualified and how long was she doing this practice. We then went to a family dentist and he gave a declined opinion and said I only had 5 cavalries and definitely no root canals. To be misdiagnosed when I have these fears of the dentist is just cruel. Be careful u might be getting filling that might not be there. People are cruel and corrupt and this has seriously taken a huge toll on me.< /Review>

I Love Doctor Miranel, she's awesome. I had an older doctor who took care of me, but he had to leave our town so I was left with no doctor, but doctor Miranel showed up and treated me like my old doctor did. I recommend her highly.< /review>

<text>I wish I could give this place zero stars. The dentist here refused to see my brother because my mom questioned how long she had been a dentist after relaying the news that my brother had 18 cavities and probably needed three root canal‘s. But she didn’t even have the decency to call after our first appointment to let us know that at our appointment the next day she would be hiding in the back telling her office staff to let us know that she would no longer be seeing our family. We went to get a second opinion from an old family friend and come to find out that my brother only has five cavities and doesn’t need any root canal’s. I’m not sure if it’s just Medi-Cal dentist in general or if this office is an exception but definitely don’t go here because who knows if this dentist and her staff even tell you the truth! It sure is scary when it comes to one’s health but when you know that you can’t trust someone and you’re being lied to it just makes you sick. I hope other people have had better experiences but this was our experience and we want to put it out there into the world.<//text><userid>110249942349864950712<//userid>< rate>

<text>I'm only giving one star because I had to, but if you have anything but ex rays needed, this is not the dentist for you. I referred a friend here and all they do are take xrays and tell you now you need a real dentist for any other fillings or a simple tooth extraction. They are worthless If you need actual dental work done. Very disappointed! Don't waste your time.< /text><gmapID>0x8090557caf566013:0x9ab491a750ca13cd</gmapID>< name>

<review>The front desk ppl try to get you in.  But the drs dont much believe you even if you saw a dr there for 5yrs and they didnt make good notes and then left.  They dont want to help you with your issues unless it is something like hep C that's been around forever.  They at least give blood pressure meds which the Tracy location didnt want to continue giving anything even though they can see your whole 20yr history in the computer.  They forget to do referrals,not very compassionate or knowledgeable about today's illnesses such as genetic diseases.  Just in a hurry to get you to a specialist so they dont have to "deal" with you.  Most are directly out of school.  Tried to switch dr's and the dr i was going to see called my current dr and told her:  i dont wanna deal with going thru her history and deal with her medical condition. My dr called me to tell me the new dr didnt want to see me so i should continue seeing her since no one else will within golden valley.  I had to get a referral from a friend to ANOTHER TOWN 30MIN AWAY who listens to me and gives me meds,tests,referrals anytime.  They take Medicare only though.  Which is fine:  i have both MEDI-CAL AND MEDICARE.  I tried to make an appointment with a dr similar to the one i had that retired and it was 3 months out!  Unless you need a flu shot right now i would seriously try somewhere else.  The dentist was the same:  in a hurry to refer out to not deal with you.  Im telling her i have a cavity (the tooth is brown and chipping on gumline)and she said:  it's fine let's watch it and see what it does.  I come in early for my filling on tooth nx to it complaining gum between both teeth hurt.  Assistant takes X-ray further up the tooth and discovers the CAVITY ON THE TOOTH I KEPT TELLING HER I HAD A CAVITY ON.  They dont LISTEN TO YOU!  I WAS A DENTAL DAUGHTER FOR 30YRS!  My mom retired and my teeth fell to the hands of govment clinics and everytime they get "a nice/good dr/dentist they go somewhere else!
The dr's in clinics are just doing their internship/residency here until they can work at a private office.
I would go to a well worth dr who has done their residency in a private office who is in your network or try to get a secondary insurance so you can go to a place that listens.  Or you may end up like me with an illness that if caught, wouldn't have destroyed kidneys/liver/pancreas/ gulbladder/blood/cell absorbtion.< /review><Date>1563553662260< /Date><userid>109081930187755196602< /userid><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

Very unprofessional and non informative.
I came in for a cold cough and the doctor didn't even try to help with my medical needs nor did he even introduce himself when walking into the room.  He made feel extremely uncomfortable and was completely off subject on the reason why I came for the medical visit. Also he made me feel like he was absolutely invading my privacy in terms of my medical history and was very non-understanding.
He prescribed me with medications that have nothing to do with my sickness.
And also did not inform me of the medications I'm supposed to be taking and what it will do. He was just rushing to get me in and out.
I don't recommend this clinic and will not be revisiting again.
I'm better off paying out of pocket with Kaiser and get the real medical attention I needed and deserved.< /Text>

<Review>The girls at the front were saying my info WAY too loud. HIPPA... I went in for depression anxiety and i left feeling 10x worse than i did coming in. The Dr reviewed my sheet i filled out for anxiety and kept repeating "thats not good! Thats very very bad, this is not good". Okay, i know thats why im here. Then when i asked if she could give me something for the panic attacks she said not a good idea xanax is addicting. Made me feel like she was saying im an addict. Anyway, going to a councilor today and if its the same kind of experience I am going right to the ER.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Also the environment so clean that you really want to be tread it.
It is a spectacular, clean and quiet place that you can feel at home, with the kindness of each of the employees and even the Dr, you feel one with the confidence of being treated there.
Thank you so much Golden Valley.

Fantastic service (having multiple employees working as a team made for a wonderful & speedy experience) & delicious food (my dish needed salt, but they had a great selection of hot sauce to flavor it up). Large portions & so good I ate all of my veg skillet and banana & peanut butter pancake. So good, I got a hummus bagel sandwich to go for later. The server was patient with my ordering & kept my delicious iced tea flowing. The patio is cute & dog friendly. Give them a try, you won’t be disappointed.</review>

I absolutely LOVE the fact that breakfast is served until 2pm; it gave our family a chance to hike during cooler morning hours but still have breakfast items as our 1st meal. Wonderful decor, staff and indoor & outdoor seating. Vegan and vegetarian options, appropriately priced, nice sized portions and everything tastes extremely fresh. A big thumbs up and we highly recommend eating here.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80960d967cbef955:0x7b91bd138cc09158< /gmapID></record>

<text>Holy Ruben, best Ruben I have ever had and I have had New York deli. They cook their corned beef to perfection. The tomato and bisque soup was also great. The only reason this place falls short of 5 stars is because my partner ordered the turkey bacon wrap and it was very sub par, too much lettuce and not a great tortilla. Definitely will be back for that ruben. Also the service was great

Darn was so stoked on the lunch we came back for dinner and got the biscuits and chicken and it was good tasting but the portion I just payed for was ridiculous. It was two medium sized biscuits and barely any chicken.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>My family and I were in need of breakfast before heading back home. The Warming Hut was probably the best breakfast location I have ever been to. The environment of the restaurant was lively and extremely comforting. The aesthetic themes they chose for their walls to the cute red coffee cups really give off this warm, welcoming feeling that really compliment the cold snowy location.

The staff are amazing, they are very polite and friendly. They greeted us with smiles and made it our satisfaction their priority. All of them seemed to love their job and the manager knows exactly how to treat everyone.

I had the chorizo omelette, and my uncle had the monkey cakes. The monkey cakes were humongous and were stuffed with chocolate, bananas, and topped off with a generous amount of whipped cream. He found it perfect, but I thought there was too much chocolate and not enough cake. The chorizo omelette was delicious. The chefs behind the dish really knew what to add to make the spicy sausage even more scrumptious.< /text><GmapID>0x80960d967cbef955:0x7b91bd138cc09158</GmapID><user_id>109516872923861892273<//user_id>< date>

< Review>
This restaurant is a complete gem in Mammoth!  We were in Mammoth last month, and again this month, and it’s our favorite place to go.  The food is comforting and deliciously prepared.  Great drinks!!  Fresh homemade soups with homemade ingredients.  A pure delight to dine there!  Joey has been our waiter on several occasions, and he welcomes his customers with his engaging personality.  Paul, the owner, is a true delight also with his welcoming personality to make everyone feel “right at home!”  They are working hard to keep their place open with all the COVID restrictions. You will NOT be sorry to dine here! Enjoy!!< /Review>

The food is amazing. Everything tastes fresh  and real. We had the Texas hash, blueberry pancake, and a side of sausage. The BBQ was perfectly done - and that’s coming from someone used to Texas BBQ. The entire meal was light overall and not heavy on sugar or oil. Definitely a nice change of pace from the typical greasy breakfast<//Text>

This place was highly recommended by everyone. Yet we went for breakfast and it was not very exciting. Service was absolutely the worst. They were either very overworked,  or not so good at their job. Anyway, clearly this place must be good, so give it a try, but my experience was not that great.</review>

<review>Everything is warm at Warming Hut! The food, the atmosphere, the service was all really nice. Erica was awesome! We sat at the bar and had several servers stop in and say hi and check on us to make sure we had all we wanted. Food was perfect for a cold night. We will definitely be back!< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Excellent service and good food. I’d give it 5 stars if not for the somewhat deceiving description of the Chicken and Biscuit dinner plate. The menu leads one to believe that it is a chicken pot pie, when in fact it’s biscuits smothered a chicken gravy, and to make matters worse, I only found one cube piece of chicken breast.  My girlfriend had the Sea Bass Dinner dish; however, she and I both felt that thiin the filet looked and it tasted like tilapia.  Having said that, I would return to try some of the other dishes.<//Review>

UPDATE: they have an apres ski menu. The cocktails were refreshing! And the food was good, as usual

Great deal for good food in Mammoth. I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The sandwich was delicious and the soup was really good with a little flair to it.</text>

It took around 20 mins just to order our drinks, it wasn't crowded and we still didn't get our food until at least a hour after we ordered, as they were ordering other people who got there AFTER us and what we got was underwhelming (we got soup of the day which was chicken noodle soup) literally had no noodles or chicken, so we ordered grilled cheese, that took 25 minutes. Also for this place being called The Warming Hut most the food was cold when it was given to us so, ya don't come here it is also Extremely over priced . 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND< /review>

My experience here wasn't great. The wait for a table for two at 10:30am on a Sunday was pretty short - about 10 minutes. However, it seemed the waiters/waitresses don't really work well together here because there was a lot of confusion over who had our table. It took us about 15 minutes before someone came to take our order (and that was only after having to flag someone down) and then another 20 minutes just to get our coffee. There were several tables seated after us that had their food before we even had our order taken. The waitress was very kind and gave us our drinks for free, but I was still disappointed in the amount of time I lost to waiting. The food itself was just okay. I had the veggie hash with avocado instead of egg. It was nothing special. The  hot vanilla was pretty good though.< /review>

Great atmosphere and friendly service are more important to me that great food but this restaurant has it all. A cozy fireplace, lots of sunshine through the plentiful windows and beautiful decor. The owner waited on me early one morning this week and was very cheerful. The short stack was great, served quickly. The Warming Hut is my new breakfast spot.<//text>

New favorite breakfast and lunch place in town.  Food is great, employees are friendly, owner is amazing.
I went with a larger group of family and got to try most of the breakfast items.
The hashes are incredible.
The pancakes are impossibly fluffy for the altitude, and the topping selection is so fun!
Get the butter coffee, don't think twice.</Text>

I would give no stars but that isn't an option
Don't go there if you expect friendly service, or any service at all. We were seated and then watched as our waitress waited on others-who had come in after us. We waited over 15 min. and didnt get asked if we wanted coffee or any drinks. She did stop by and gruffly said"ill be right with you" and then chatted seated and brought coffee to a couple she obviously knew. Was unpleasant and .ade us feel unwelcome. We went to Th Stove and had a lovely breakfast< /review>

We had a delicious lunch here with great service on the busy 4th of July weekend.  My sister and niece came to town and this is the lunch spot we met at. The Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato fries is my favorite thing here on the menu.  I normally don't use catsup, but I do here since they make it themselves. These place is great! Excellent service and high quality food.<//review>

I had the Mountain Cuban sandwich, which was excellent. The best thing was the gluten free bun—it was tasty!  They also have great French fries and make their own ketchup. The owner stopped by to see how everything was—super pleasant and personable. I can’t wait to try their gluten free pancakes!<//review>

Highly recommend coming to this new breakfast / lunch restaurant.  Homemade ketchup is amazing.  This place will get busy once people start hearing about it! Service was great as well, thanks Nate!< /Review>

<username>Rebekah Zweiban<//username><review>Food was Awesome!!! Service was slow. Don't go if you're in a hurry. We waited to be seated for about 30- min... the food is worth it! Love the hash combinations and the sweet potato fries. The prices are reasonable and the portions healthy size. I will go back for the vegi hash alone!!!<//review>< response>

Mountain Tavrrn had over an hour wait so our second choice was the Warming Hut. We have enjoyed  breakfast there so why not dinner? The service was adequate.  Included in our order was a hamburger and a cheeseburger with grilled onions. When the bill arrived, we were charged an extra $3.00 for romaine and grilled onions x 2. After questioning the waitress, she removed the romaine charge but not the onions. In the future, it would be a good idea to inform the customer of the up charge when taking the order. The food was fine, but the onion charge made no sense to us. Our bill was over $75 with water only.< /text>

I’m so, so happy I stumbled (literally) across this place while visiting Mammoth. I had a whole list of restaurants Google Map’d before arriving, without Warming Hut on the list (I must’ve missed it). Upon arriving, I was greeted with exceptional service. Multiple servers greeted and asked what drinks we’d like (a plus I feel, rather than getting nothing). We both ordered some coffee, my significant other got the Quiche Bites, and I got the Corned Beef Hash. She told me the Quiche Bites were excellent and I KNOW my hash was EXCELLENT! Some of the most tender and flavorful corned beef I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Again, the staff was exceptional and the food is out of this world. I wish I had enough time in town to come again! I will for sure recommend to anyone in Mammoth.< /Text>

Took over 45 minutes for the staff to make three basic meals and the quality of the food was not worth the wait.

Bearded server gave us attitude when we asked for things like syrup and butter when they didn't deliver it with the pancakes. Kinda rude for no reason

Pancakes were redeeming tho. Avoid on weekends if you want fast service.</Text>

What a great little gem of a restaurant to find. W were looking for someplace to have breakfast and stumbled onto this place. Very friendly and attentive staff and wonderful food. I had the Inyo face with serrano chilis, potatoes and their homemade sausage, My wife had their whole grain pancakes with the berry compote. Good stuff, highly recommend!!< /text>

There are reviews stating the wait time is long. I would like to state that this restuarant is new. When you first open a business you have to work out the kinks.

I ordered an ice tea, bowl of creamy tomatoe soup with a grilled cheese and a ceaser salad. I think the tomatoe soup was probably the best tomatoe soup I have had in a long while.

Ceaser salad was done well, good homemade dressing, homemade croutons, and shredded romaine the way I like it.

The grilled cheese was on a good loaf of bread.

I really enjoy the outdoor seating and decor. Use of mason jars for glasses and nice dishwear for the food.

The owner is also very polite and you can tell she takes pride in her business and wants her customers to enjoy themselves.

If you are in town give them a chance!< /text>

< Review>
Justin Lorenz at Salon 1500 provides the best Men's Haircut. Best men's cut in the Bay Area. I return to him every month, for his attention to detail and his focus on the resulting shape of my hair. 10/10 for quality and service.</Review>

I randomly decided to get my hair transformed and was a bit nervous to meet a NEW stylist. Rite away Katrina was amazing ! Super friendly with a great vibe. I shower her photos of what I wanted my hair to look like and she Provided me with honest feedback in regards to the process it would take to eventually get my hair with the highlights I wanted, I personally really appreciated her transparency and made the process so much smoother my hair came out looking feeling and smelling amazing!

Btw the shop is super super clean and flows Covid -19 regulations</review>

This is my hometown salon and I love it! Everyone is so friendly and it's very clean and bright. Justin Lorenz is my guy and he really takes pride in his work. I really look forward to getting my cuts from him. He knows my face and how to frame it correctly. I trust him so much because he genuinely loves his profession and treats it as an art form. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Justin is the Best!!! I did Kerotine treatment with him and my Family. I Loved to get hair cut from him very courteous,  respectful  and flexible time availability.
I have been visiting salon 1500 for almost 10 years and  I always get quality service. Since I get my hair cut with Justin he is now our Family hair stylist.<//text>

<Review>Instead of making me the last customer of the night I was told it's by appointment only after a certain time. There is nothing saying anything about appointment after a certain time. No biggie. The big one is to walk by moments after to see the lady outside playing on her phone and smoking for the remainder of her shift. (30 minute's or more)  A new face should be one to impress to get a return customer. Not turned away so you can have a smoke break and phone play.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808f86cc48ba5c6d:0x2d30a478857d8c8e</gmap_id>< user_name>

Interesting concept, newly decorated with tool boxes for supplies and looked clean and will probably be nice when it's done. It's down the street from Franklin school so not much parking out on the street as its in a residential neighborhood. The prices are elevated. Now every stylist charges what they want and I'm guessing they rent booth space. However $75 for a simple angled bob seems excessive to me. An up do for prom was the same price. Add a tip and you're near/at $100. Now similar up do cost only $60 from another stylist, but she had said she could do it based off photos then completely couldn't and I left dissatisfied and still had to pay full price and my hair was falling out of the pins from the moment we left. I fixed it as best I could at home before we left and was thankful it wasn't an important event for me. I guess I've had better for more detail and less cost elsewhere and won't be returning. Prices should be posted by each stylist somewhere so you know what you're in for.< /review>

<UserId.>100734114758773965955</UserId.><Review>OMG!! I had a horrible hair cut experience at another salon ... I called this salon in tears last minute because I was so upset and couldn’t go home with my hair the way it was. The guy over the phone immediately found someone to fix my hair and provided me with so much comfort. I truly truly truly appreciate him so much. Cecilia fixed my hair and styled it. I went from a really Crappy day to an awesome one. Thank you so much to the both of you for making time and making me feel beautiful. I will personally fly from NJ to CA just to get my hair done here. Def recommend this place, modern with great vibes< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Took a chance on these folks last year — been stoked ever since. The economy has me shopping the cheap end of the menu and I’m never disappointed — but the whole menu is high value stuff, well curated and aggressively priced with great service to match. You love to see it.</Review>< Pics>

The gentleman that came was very friendly! He was almost misdirected but stayed and gave me a few mins to come down. This was my first time ordering from them. As long as I get gentlemen like him… service with a smile! They will continue to get my business!<//Review>

Best first time experience ever... Very professional and friendly employees...helped with all the questions I had... delivery arrived as scheduled.. actually sooner than I expected..the text said the driver would be arriving in 10 minutes and they got here in 4 minutes instead... definitely ordering from here again...Thank you City Greens......< /review>

Everything was fast, I barely had to wait, and waiting is the work part for anything. After being greeted with a smile by Jasmin, all the information I could need is on the package, so all my questions were answered before I could even think to ask them. Also, no unexpected fees from unknown taxes or anything like that, just overall a smooth transaction.<//review>

Excellent product all around the menu and the prices are the cheapest in town. Sherbinski is sold here 🔥.Do a price check on the brand they advertise and you will find no one cheaper. If anyone can find a cheaper price, DM me and I'll buy you an eighth.<//review>

They good , but been In business for a while now and still do only cash. Seems an little inconvenient every time you wanna order from the couch. And times can be 5 mins or 3 hours. Also they need to have a VIP program because if you order every 2 days like me, you should be valued!< /review>

City greens is always very professional. I order a lot from them because of this. Today’s driver was Sean, he was great! He arrived right in front of my location and the transaction was like clock work. His costumer was excellent and would highly recommend him and city greens to take care of your order in a timely manor.<//review>

City greens comes thru all the time even if it's super late, You ain't getting a solid deal anywhere else. Also I have been smoking for 15 years and they carry California's finest cannabis products.<//text>

Literally the ONLY service I’ve bought from since the pandemic and they’ve never disappointed me once. The entire delivery staff is always on time, even like 30 minutes EARLY. Yea. EARLY. Amin is running a solid business and I highly recommend anything off of their menu to anyone who hasn’t tried them. City Greens... thank you for all you do! Amar came through and is ALWAYS a great conversation! Got some pre rolls too! 💪🏾</Text>

Best delivery service in the Bay Area right now!! Quality bud for the best prices as far as I can find (and I have LOOKED) and I mean even their least expensive bud is so dense and crystally and beautiful. Not to mention, the owner is the kindest dude - and they have the absolute best customer service I have ever experienced buying cannabis. Thank you city greens!!

Big ups to Sean for bringing me my weekly Gelato! I cant imagine my life without City Greens. I havent set foot in a dispensary in over a year and see no reason to ever go back. Super quick delivery, flat prices, and always the chillest drivers. See ya next week!< /Review>

Hybrids and indicas are great, but I'm a sativa man. This Red Congolese is some funk! This smell is something else and it's a great, true sativa high. My 1/8th was pretty much two giant nugs and a baby. Great prices and quick delivery</Review>

<Review>First time so cant speak for everything but they had a good deal on a  oz of zips blue cookies about 40 bucks cheaper then average price. Delivery took nearly 3 hours 🤷‍♂️

Update. I keep coming back for the oz of zips 👌
Also who's the baddie who just delivered 😍< /Review><Date>1586041863687<//Date>< gmap_id>

<review>I work independently which means a lot of the time, the companies I work for will send packages to be held for pickup, this location charges $15 for a service that is free at any other FedEx or UPS Store I've ever been to. DO NOT GIVE THIS OWNER YOUR MONEY OR BUSINESS. If I had seen the other reviews I would have avoided this place and for good reason.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I have been coming to this UPS store for years. I am always greeted with a sincere and warm "Hello". The service is excellent. they usually have to box up and wrap up all the things that I bring in and they do so with a smile and pride in their work. I love coming into the store knowing that they remember me and always ask how I am and are willing to carry on a conversation, they always make me feel welcome. This is the best UPS store I have gone to. I will NEVER do to any other UPS store!!!!!!</Review>

No prices posted and Price Gouger.
Here's what a friend said:
WHAT the "H", did you really pay that amount??? That's insane...highway robbery!  Was the piece framed and have glass on it?  I always do my own packing and have shipped larger pieces for less than half that.</text>

Number 1. Nasty rude indian man that acted like a woman on her period with his attitude for no reason wanted to charge me $10 for taping a box on top of that. #2. Bad costumer service horrible i should say! i was waiting and he let 2 Costumers and being annoyingly nice to them and he had me waiting for more than 20 min while i was first.. i asked him you should've told me about the charges for taping his reply obviously "i told you". Then i left to UPS the one at staples the difference was like day and night classy no additional charges.. Good job staples. Go to the UPS at staples. This UPS store is Garbage just like it's owner.<//text>

I visited this UPS store few days ago and I had some issue with my UPS shipping label. Some member of their team over there told me that he can't call UPS since corporate was closed since they were in East Coast. I called corporate myself right after I left store and they answered my call.

Employees in this place are very rude and they will lie to you just to get rid of you. They definitely don't provide customer service that UPS requires them. Not recommended at all<//review>

Please do not visit this store and save your money, No price posted and after the service they are charge you anything. The guy who work over there he say they only accept cash if you don't wanna pay tax. I said go to the nearest UPS store the price difference you will understand automatically. I am giving this store as one star because I cannot gave a "0" but thake is as a 0 and never ever visit this store.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd28a8ca2c83c5:0xda51429a364c8688< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was charged $12 for a 3x9x18 box. Called another ups store for an estimate and they said it was about $5. That Indian manager is a greedy person and I hope karma catch up with him. Take your money but you've lost a customer for life. Never doing business here again.< /Text>

Loud...Rude...Arrogant...and possibly the worst customer service i have ever seen.
Not only will you be mistreated but also coaxed into buying additional box...tape etc...

The manager not only is rude to his customers but also to his employee...

I did overhear him call a particular customer..."cheap..." coz he refused to buy additional box....

Suggestion : Keep calm and stay away from this store< /Review>

Really wish I could give this place less than 1 star. Always have had bad experiences they do NOT follow their business hours as I came here to ship a package and it was 9:00 and still not open when they are supposed to open at 8 am. Lazy employees with horrible customer service.<//Text>

<review>Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at this store my guess is with the same Indian guy as everybody did. He tried to charge me $1.50 just because I asked him kindly if he could tape the pre-paid shipping label on the box.  I understand that is a business but I already pre-paid for the shipping and also use to ship out a lot of items there.  He also was rude when I told him that I was going to report his store for ripping off the customers.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Customer service is horrible.. I called recently to verify if I could fax something and the guy SHOUTED out that it was $3 dollars to fax the first page when I asked him the second time..

I was only trying to make sure I didn't misunderstood him since I could barely hear him on the phone.. The guy has to chill the ... out he's not doing me a favor, in fact we're doing him a favor</text>

It's a joke to come to this location. 20 dollars to print 6 papers because one little hyperlink was printed in color and the manager doing it didn't even give us the option for color or black ink. When we asked why, he told us because we didn't specify. WE DIDN'T KNOW. Serious scam. He then proceeded to tell us if we didn't want it, we could get out.<//Text>

<text>The Indian guy running this store will try to overcharge you everytime. He still thinks he's ripping off tourists back in Mumbai.
He's charging $288 to rent a small mailbox per year, other UPS stores charge $145< /text>< pics>

Papa John's stuffed crust pizza is better than Pizza huts in my opinion. I tried a new flavor with Alfredo sauce using the Papa John's app is super easy to order. My only complaint about my Alfredo Papa John's stuffed crust pizza was there was a little too much Alfredo sauce and it was a little overwhelming after a few slices. But I eat a lot of slices on my cheat day so if you're just probably going to have four slices no worries but I ate almost the whole large myself.<//review>

I just called, to order one of the heart pizzas the guy who answered was rude, and I felt like he was rushing me. I order often at this location, and the girls working the night shift are always nice, but this is the first time I felt that I received poor service. I didn’t ask for his name, but I will check my receipt, and edit this later.<//Review>

Pizza showed up an hour after ordering. Was apparently bundled with another delivery order. I wouldve just ordered from another place had I known this, or have them wait to make my order, but the thing is there was no courtesy call, no apology from the driver until I said something. 20 min after the estimated delivery time. All it wouldve taken is for you guys to call and explain the situation. Thanks for the room temperature pizza. I'll be ordering from other places from now on.< /text>

Always late. When you come for a pickup, pizza is cold as they don't keep the pizza in a closed oven... Really? Papa you can do better then that.<//Review>

<text>Bad custumer service. I ordered a 8" pizza and they gave me my total of 4 dolars and some cents. When i was about to pay. Casheir asked me if I rather get the 10". Thinking that would be a better deal i agreed. Then he gave me my total of 15 dolars. 10$ more for 2" extra. I told them about the big difference and they told me they couldnt cancel the order..<//text><resp>None</resp>< userid>

I had a full body deep tissue message. It a very relaxed environment and clean. They play soothing music while you are getting treatment. This place will make sure you feel comfortable, confident and brand new.</Text>

I make it to garden spa at least twice a month. It's very clean, the service is awesome and the people are very nice. The atmosphere itself is just wonderful and the prices are sooo reasonable. Always a pleasure. No regrets<//Review>

< review>
The massage was great. The place is nice & there is plenty of parking behind the massage parlor and I will be going back to try the facial BUT the only thing I didn't like was when I gave the massage therapist a tip he scoffed and walked away. The receptionist was nice & explained that they usually like a 10% tip of whatever you pay but the guys reaction to getting a tip was rude.</review>

<Text>I received a bad massage at this spa. If a friend was giving me this kind of massage for free, I would've told him to stop. The masseur either had no interest or was totally unskilled. In a 90 minute "massage," which actually lasted for 75 minutes, the masseur took several breaks and I even had to move tables in the middle of it, which is not that conducive to the experience. I honestly do not even understand what I paid for. I came here because of the high rating on Google, so I am compelled to say that what I received was a ripoff and felt exploitative.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Perched on top of a little hill just a few blocks from the ocean, this grassy park has a perfect peek-a-boo view of the water and beautiful hillside homes. Great for a dog walk, a nice stroll or run, or even playtime for the kids at the playground located on the lower end of the park. There are conveniently placed benches and trash cans, so feel free to bring a picnic lunch, enjoy the coastal and cliffside views and watch the boats cruise through the harbor.< /Review>< userid>

Great park but residents (?) There give you strange looks and makes you feel uncomfortable. People walking their dogs or sitting at the park would just look at you if you parked thereb to walk to the beach. The park is beautiful though</text>

< Review>
Dr. Brian is the best. This is the second time I have seen Dr. Brian for acute issues where I was debilitated from pain. Both times, with just one session, his adjustments made me feel 100% better. I was able to fully function without pain. He is an incredible healer.<//Review>

Dr Brian and his staff are the best.  I went in with a bulged disc in my lower back and he's been great at getting me on track to no more pain.   Been going for a good couple of months and I'm getting better.  Can finally sit for longer road trips and don't have to worry about aching at the track.
No complaints at all, their prices are great and he does great work.  Sending all my friends this way.</Text>

From the moment I stepped into the office and was greeted by Kelly I felt right at home. Dr. Brian spent a lot of time asking me about my injuries and when I told him I was nervous about getting adjusted he took great care of me. I highly  recommend Dr. Brian.<//review>

< review>
For anyone who has been skeptical about the efficacy or benefits of Chiropractic treatment,  let me say that until I began receiving treatment from Dr. Ben  Spencer of
Wellness Chiropractic, 4761 Hoen Ave,  Santa Rosa,  California, I use to identify with you, but No More!😊 At my initial  appointment with Dr. Ben Spencer, I found him to be extremely patient with me and my long term skepticism and several questions  - despite the fact that he, obviously had other patients waiting to see him! His knowledge of the human body and how it functions was also quite evident.  I have been a patient of his for 2 years now.  I was in his office last week and he and his Partner, Dr. Brian, were quite busy and yet  they and their patients were practicing proper Covid-19 protocols the whole time I was there! I  wholeheartedly recommend Wellness Chiropractic! By the way my wife, Dianne,  retired from her office job at a Marin County Chiropractic Office, and swore by chiropractic  treatment,  but still wasn't able to convince me to try Chiropractic treatment! So, now,  I'm happy that we  can both give 5 - Stars to Chiropractic treatment and Wellness Chiropractic!
Sincerely,
Lee Pierce

<review>Today I brought my 16 yr old daughter for an adjustment with Dr. Spencer. He did a fantastic job at explaining what he was doing the whole time. He also gave great advice to her in regards to posture and what is good and not good for the body. My daughter already feels a difference.< /review>< rate>

From beginning to end my initial visit with Dr. Spencer & the wellness clinic staff was nothing but positive. The secretary was very welcoming and kind and Dr. Spencer was very thorough and knowledgeable. I will be returning next week and will definitely be using him for my adjustments in the future. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a chiropractor in the area.< /review>

Super clean facility with the friendliest front desk service!!  After two visits with Dr. Ben my lower back feels better than it has in a year - I finally have hope that this is something that can be taken care of!! I was skeptical going in, but the proof is in the relief!!!  His rates are far more affordable than a lot of other places in the area, and he has a no nonsense approach, meaning he gets right to work on your body.  So thankful to have discovered this place!!</review>

<gmap_id>0x8084488fb1c64627:0x93673f1f4a0120cb<//gmap_id><Review>I’m temporarily up here in the Bay Area and thought I had injured my spine, maybe pulled something out of place. So I was referred by a friend to see Dr. Brian whom she swears is amazing. Well sure enough, Dr. Brian fixed my issue which turned out to actually be an issue with my neck. But he also  discovered an issue with my head. He said it was literally not sitting correctly on my neck 😱 I had no idea.. didn’t even know that was a thing.
I was in a car accident back in 2014 and have had an issue with a certain pain/tightness on the right side of my head behind my ear and down my neck since then. So anyway, Dr. Brian found the issue and fixed it right then and there in 1 shot!
I also basically ended up getting a full body adjustment and the next day I felt like I had worked out 😆 I cannot believe I don’t have that pain and discomfort in my neck anymore and also that I spent YEARS... with another Chiro back home who had me do months of therapy and many xrays but never figured it out. I’m sad I won’t have him closer to home 😕
Thanks Dr. Brian, I’m so glad Aimee referred me to you!<//Review>< user_name>

<review>Dr Brian, DC is fantastic in his presentation, his knowledge, his approach and with his safe adjustments. I highly recommend his services. I went in unable to walk with a hip muscles flare up, and his work Ana guidance had me sleeping, no longer in agony, that very night. Whew. The waiting room staff are courteous and very helpful. I work in physical therapy and they function better than my clinic. The staff got me in same day, even though schedule was full.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

I love this place! The environment is very clean, friendly, and welcoming. The service is great. The staff is professional, pleasant, and always willing to meet the needs of their clients.  I have walked in many times complaining of my aches and pains to find later that the services rendered was exactly what I needed.  My problem is eliminated and my energy is replenished. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Wellness Chiropractic to everyone I know. Even if you don't have a complaint just pop in I guarantee you'll always find a friendly smile. ♡</Review>

Brian was awesome. I have been to several local chiropractors and this experience was hands down the best start to finish. Clean and comfortable office, great communication throughout and his adjustments were some of the best I ever had.

Thank you Brian. I found my go-to Chiropractor!</Review>

I highly recommend! The office is kept sterilized during this pandemic and you are asked to come in wearing a mask. You will be asked to wash your hands immediately after entering the front door before touching anything. I felt totally safe going here for my chiropractic care.

Going anywhere public feels scary right now during the pandemic, but this office is practicing extensive sanitary practices and made me feel safe and cared for throughout my visit.
Dr. Spencer was kind and helped me understand why I was in pain, and helped to ease it.  I'm looking forward to future visits knowing they will help me be a happier and healthier person!</Text>

I’ve been seeing Dr Brian for over 4 years.  He came into our lives during a rough time in my life. On top of being diagnosed with Neuro Lyme Disease, MRI showed 2 bulged disks, along with degenerative disks.  Dr B said that  I was a candidate for the DHR Machine.  After my treatments the MRI showed the bulges back in place. The excruciating pain was gone and best part: No surgery needed!
I’m thankful to have Dr Brian on my healing team.
Today I go in for a few adjustments here and there as needed.
If you are looking for an incredible chiropractor Dr B is the place to go.  As a family guy his family is top priority so he wants to make sure your at your best for your family as well.
I’ve been able to recommend a lot of my friends and family to see Dr B and they all say the same thing....”Dr Brian ROCKS”
Shout out to his incredible wife Kelly who keeps the front desk and all the behind the scenes action going so Dr Brian can adjust, adjust, adjust!<//Text>

He was more concerned with getting me off all the meds I'm on and explained how my quality of life could be so much better with changing my diet and some minimal exercise.  I walked out feeling far better than I went in, he got me back in line my body was a mess! And texted me all the info I needed to make a life change that could keep me around a long time. After a week now Im feeling very good again, I have recommended co workers and family to go see him.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Dr Thalhamer is excellent.  Really awesome with explaining everything, always open to questions you don’t feel like he’s in a hurry.  I got a great workup on my body just with the first visit.  I work with a lot of doctors, I can honestly say that I’m feeling like he’s one of those best ones.  I highly recommend him.<//text>

It’s hard for me to put into words how grateful I am to have found Dr. B. I’ve been to several chiropractors over the years (I’ve even worked for one) and as a bodyworker myself it’s hard for me to be impressed.

I came into Dr. B’s office in the worst low back pain I’d ever experienced. An old injury had been inflamed by body work I’d received at another location. After 5 days of this pain not subsiding I truly feared that I was going to have to drastically change my active lifestyle.

Within seconds of being on Dr. B’s table I knew he was the real deal. He found parts of my body that had been stuck for many years. And that low back is pretty much non existent. I feel elated!

I honestly could not stop praising him to the point of feeling like a “Fan Girl“😂😂. I think at at one point I said to him  “I can’t believe you’re real.”

Hands down the best and most knowledgeable chiropractor I’ve been to.

And not to mention Kelly at the front desk is a true gem. She made me feel heard and got down to the business of me getting better with actual sincerity. I’m sold on Wellness Chiropractic🙌🏾

Cheers!

EXCELLENT CHIROPRACTOR. I went in after getting a  recommendation from a trusted source. Clean and pristine environment. Dr. Brian fixed all of my physical tensions and body alignment issues. Can't wait to go back!< /Text>

<review>My daughter was having back pain due to a sports knee injury that required surgery so her physical therapist referred us to Wellness Chiropractic.  Dr Thalhamer showed us the areas that needed to be adjusted and thoroughly explained what he was doing and why.  Everyone in the office was very friendly and helpful. Can’t say enough good things about our first impression of this practice!</review>< pics>

Dr. Brian is great! The office has a great atmosphere and welcoming staff, always with a smile. Dr. Brian is very professional, obviously well educated in his profession and most importantly ALWAYS fixes me when I come in on the verge of tears.<//review>

I was a little apprehensive on about my  first appointment and how it go  but I was immediately assured by the thorough assessment that Dr. Brien did, both on paper and on my body. He manipulated my body this way and that but when I left his office I could immediately feel the difference in some areas of my upper and lower back. I have a follow up appointment soon and plan, at this point, to see him regularly as I have confidence that 'regular maintenance'  can help me feel better.< /review>

<review>Dr. Brian has been treating my family and I for at least 15 years. He is very professional and personable, but most importantly he is a REAL chiropractor. He possesses tremendous knowledge of anatomy and physiology such that, like a great mechanic, he understand what is causing your pain, and then he will actually adjust you down to your toes.<//review>< Pictures>

I am always amazed at how much better I feel after a visit with Dr. B. It's almost magical. I had a chronic issue that bothered me for two years which my podiatrist could not effectively relieve. I experienced constant pain. I described the issue to Dr. B and he gave me a 'correction'. That was almost two years ago and it has not bothered me since!</Review>

Dr. Spencer explained every step of the way what was going on and what I could do to better my overall lifestyle. Definitely going back again and recommending this place.

<rate>5< /rate><text>I went  to Wellness Chiropractic for my first visit today and I was so pleased with the experience. The receptionist was very welcoming and warm and explained everything to me thoroughly.  Dr. Brian was an amazing! I was there because I had been in a car accident and  he made sure to get all the details about my pain as well as the incident itself. He took x-rays and explained why my body was in discomfort and his plan of action. He had great bedside manner and genuinely cared about my body getting back to where I was before the accident. I personally have a lot of anxiety about neck adjustment but by the end of this visit it was so apparent that he was very knowledgeable and experienced in this field and I allowed him to adjust my neck. The adjustments left me feeling a lot better than when I first walked in. 10/10 recommend to a friend.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8084488fb1c64627:0x93673f1f4a0120cb< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr.Brian was very thorough after reviewing my prior tramas/history...came in as was suffering from a cluster headache for over 5 days. Many adjustments made and I walked out feeling alot better than when I walked in. They are very contentious of Covid and you feel safe going there.<//text>

What a great chiropractor! Not only did he fix all my issues, shoulder, neck/occiput and knee in the first treatment. He then put me on this vibrator machine that was like nothing else I've ever experienced. The next day my whole body felt stronger and solid. I would definitely recommend him!< /Review>

<review>Dr Brian is the first medical professional I have seen that made sense, addressed my actual symptoms, showed me why and how things are affected, and I left with a feeling of progress for once. After thousands of dollars, one MD, one PT, and two ER docs I finally found someone willing to take an X-ray and simply look instead of guessing at whats wrong. Such a relief. Finally a light at the end of a long dark tunnel.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I highly recommend Dr Brian. His adjustments are right on point.
Him and his wife Kelley are attentive to their patient and Dr Brian really takes the time to talk to his patients and do whatever it takes to "fix " them : )
I always walk out of there feeling like i am walking on a cloud.
They have both a great attitude and make you feel welcome the minute you pass the door. Sooo glad they are here. Thank you.</text>< Pics>

What a great experience I had with Dr. Ben Spencer. He was very thorough when explaining what he was doing and how to handle my posture and stretching after I was adjusted. I highly recommended going to him.</Text>

Nice, clean, modern office. Very friendly staff up front working the desk. Brian was an awesome chiropractor, very friendly and knowledgeable. This was my first appointment there and he was so thorough for the appointment spending an hour with me doing X-rays and strength tests. Will definitely be using this office from now on!!</Text>

<Text>I feel completely revived. I had a lot of chronic pain causing me to become more and more sedentary and over the years I had just given up. I just had my second adjustment and I am starting to feel like my old self again! They really know their medicine. The doctors are people persons and enjoy helping their patients. They aren’t the money grubbing quacks that I had grown accustomed too. They have changed my whole perspective. They really care about you. The office has a good vibe and everyone who works there is so kind. I can’t wait to get all of my friends to visit for adjustment. It is a game changer. Thank you so, so, so, so, so much. You have changed/saved my life!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1547256304095</Time></record>

<review>I’ve known Dr. Brian since we were kids, but I have always had a chiropractor. Today I called my chiropractor and the first available appointment was next Tuesday.

I reached out to Dr. Brian and he graciously got me an appointment for today. He was very thorough and professional in his exAm and the adjustments were just what I needed. I walked in not being able to lift my left arm above my shoulder, and left with many adjustments needing to be done to get me back to feeling good.

Thank you so much Wellness Chiropractic!<//review>< pictures>

As needed I have gone to Dr. Thalhamer for over 20 years.  Every time he treats my aches and pains I ask myself why have I waited so long.  I have had chronic lower pain problems since being hit by a car at 10.  As a result I have visited many Chiropractors over the last 50+ years.  Dr. Thalhamer is by far the best!  Not only does he know exactly what to do, but he stays in great shape and has the strength to do difficult manipulations.< /review>

<review>Just left Wellness Chiropractic after seeing Dr. Brian and I have to say 5 stars across the board. I've seen a number of different chiropractors over the years and with those experiences in mind-  I was really impressed with his adjustments. His adjustments were highly effective and specific. No generalized moves, all were targeted at the specific issues. He certainly had the strength to get the areas to move that other practitioners have never been able to get. Very impressed! Cindy at the front desk was wonderful too! She was personable and helpful from the first phone call through the visit. I felt supremely comfortable and at ease the entire time. Beautiful, clean and modern office as well. Highly recommended.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>I was a little short on time for my initial session. Brian did an amazing job learning about my long injury history and addressing what the current issues were, along with giving a very thoughou and extensive adjustment with reassessments and follow up.  I've been to probably 10 different chiropractor's over the years and he's by far one of the best I've seen.<//Review>< gmapID>

As a filmmaker I spend a lot of time with my head facing down looking through the viewfinder of a camera or sitting in my office editing at a desk. Dr. Ben Spencer has done an excellent job with getting my neck and lower back feeling awesome. I see him on a monthly routine so that I can focus on what I do best and no longer have to worry about any pain and discomfort that comes with my job. I'd highly recommend him to anyone looking into chiropractors!</Review>

BEST chiropractor!!!! I've seen many...and Dr Brian T. "is" the very best! He adjusts the entire body; hips, feet, jaw....my husband and I fly to Santa Rosa from Southern California to get adjusted by him. He is that good! I have not felt this good in years since I've been seeing Dr Brian T. for over a year now. People come from all over different areas to be adjusted by him.<//Review>

<text>Excellent experience!  Dr. Brian does a great job!  He is the only chiropractor that is able to give me a complete adjustment.  I’m a larger man so has been difficult to find someone able to work on me, but Dr. Brian always does a great job!</text>< UserId.>

I saw Dr. Spencer for the first time today after straining my sciatic/lower back. He really took the time to get to the root of the issue. The treatment really helped and he gave me some great advice for staying healthy. I'll definitely be returning and highly recommend!</review>

Dr. Ben Spencer takes the time to educate you on your ailments and offers various solutions; from home care to high tech options in the office. He can realign the spine without cracking, which can be uncomfortable for some. His rates are very reasonable and he won't have you coming back weekly unless you really need it.< /text>

This is the best chiropractic office I have ever experienced.  Everything about the people here and the office is five stars, but what matters the most are the results.   I have never had such a rapid response to treatment before.  There is no upselling of service or pressure to keep coming back a certain number of times.   I couldn’t be more impressed, nor could I recommend a business more highly.  Dr. Brian has the utmost integrity, and it shows in the way he runs his practice.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Ben is skilled at his craft and honorable in general.  He has helped me overcome several ailments including a partially dislocated rib that was causing me chest pain for several weeks before I eventually sought treatment.  I also see Ben for "routine maintenance" and he does a wonderful job of keeping me firing on all cylinders.  I highly recommend Dr. Ben to anybody who could benefit from chiropractic care!</Text>< Pictures>

I have been seeing Dr. Thalhamer on a regular basis for close to a year now. He helps to keep my body working to the best of its ability. He puts me back together after injuries and normal wear and tear of being an active person in my late 50's. He is awesome!< /Text>

I've had the opportunity to be adjusted by Dr. Brian and Dr. Spencer. They are both very pleasant and professional. The environment at Wellness Chiropractic is more upscale, but they still remain affordable and do not try to string you along with multiple appointments or try to sell you expensive packages or add ons, all experiences I've had at other chiropractors. I also wasn't rushed so they could get to the next patient. Regarding my last visit, the receptionist Callie was able to get me in same day, she's always very pleasant, and Dr. Brian went over my concerns and did additional adjustments at my request. Coupled with personal care at home my neck pain has resolved and a vertebrae that had been off for years is feeling a bit better as well.

TL;DR: I highly recommend Wellness Chiropractic.< /text>

Dr. Ben Spencer is the chiropractor I recommend to any of my own patients who need chiropractic care. He treats patients in very much the same way I do--spends a lot of one-to-one time with each patient, focuses on patient education and empowerment, and prescribes exercises and dietary adjustments as needed.

Personally, I've had terrific results with Dr. Ben. When I was pregnant, an adjustment from him fixed some really distressing apnea.  And he never, ever tries to up-sell--not supplements, not future appointments, nothing more than what the patient needs. He's a practitioner with both knowledge and integrity, and I'm so glad to have a practitioner like him in my primary referral network.</text>

At my first visit I felt like he already knew my pain issues..without having to ask any questions he could tell where I was out of alignment, where I needed to be adjusted, and what issues it was causing. Since then, he sees my whole family and has been able to address ear infections and coughs with my daughters. I used to hear a ringing sound in my ear from a previous injury about once per week or more. Since going to Dr. Brian, the issue is nearly gone. He is the Master! I would highly recommend his services to anyone! He is great with kids and adults alike! What are you waiting for!?! Go see Dr. Brian and you won't be disappointed!<//review>< Pics>

< review>
After being in a car accident and injuring my neck, back, arm and a couple other places on my body, I wouldn't be able to function if it wasn't for Dr. Brian. My condition has improved greatly as a result of his treatment. He takes time each visit to assess what is going on with me that day. It's amazing how he can pinpoint exactly what my concern is and work to make it better. There are days I've been in agony and I go in and in a matter of minutes I'm so grateful because I can actually move around again once Dr. Brian has adjusted me. He is thorough, kind, considerate, and genuinely cares about his patients. In addition, his office staff are friendly, making you feel welcome and they do their best to work with your schedule so that you can get seen as soon as possible.< /review>

This was my first time here. I came here because Dr Thalhamer helped my husband with an issue that caused him a great deal of pain for many months. I was impressed to see his pain relieved in such a short amount of time so I figured he was the man to see about my lower back and neck issues.  It’s been many years since I’ve  been to a chiropractor so there was a bit of fear and apprehension knowing what may be in store. As I expressed this to him he reassured me he would do as little or as much as I was comfortable with.  In retrospect, I am already experiencing improvement and I should have let him do everything, but I really appreciated that I was not pressured and my goal of being “fixed” was still attainable even if I didnt do everything yet.  Looking forward to being pain free!
Immaculate office and great receptionist too. Highly recommend !<//review>

I am 55 years old and had never been to a chiropractor.  I’ve been in pain for years, trouble sleeping, tired all the time, and suffering from brain fog and had trouble staying focused.  I‘ve been to the doctor who told me I need to go to the sleep clinic, lose weight, got my thyroid tested and it’s fine.  Blood tests gave up nothing.  My husband saw Dr. Brian because of back pain and I was so surprised at the difference in my husband I decided to go.  He took the time to find out what was bothering me, and as he was checking my back and neck asked me more questions and took the time to explain how being out of adjustment can affect so many different areas of your body.  I was scared of the adjusting process, but he put those fears to rest.  He did a lot of adjusting to me and when I got home I fell asleep.  I felt so much better after this one visit that I know when I see him again in two weeks it’s going to go up from there.  Thank you so much!</text>

Nothing but good things to say! I had really bad hip pain before finding a Groupon to try the chiropractor out. I am so glad I ended up here! Years of pain almost completely gone after a few months! Before coming I was in so much pain it was stiff and hurt to move... now I only feel occasional pain and do not need to take any pain meds anymore for this issue!<//Review>

I've always been sceptical of chiropractic work but Brian Thalhammer has completely changed that. As a powerlifter i beat upon my body often, and before finding wellness chiropractic i would generally just suffer through it. Since finding Brian and the awesome staff at wellness, chiropractic work has become a key part of my recovery and prep for training.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I was in an auto accident in February of this year, 2017 and was referred to Wellness Chiropractic and another Chiropractor.
After looking over Brian Thalhamers website and reading his story on why he became a Chiropractor I was intrigued to give him a try. I was impressed from my first visit. He started off by asking me to tell him my spinal history. This blew me away. I'd never had a chiropractor ask me about that before and over my lifetime I've seen many.
At 12 years old I was bucked off my pony and run over. At 17 I was bucked off my horse at a gallop and stepped on. At 19 I was in an auto accident, and at 27 I was in another auto accident that left me disabled for 7 years. During that time I tried to get help from Chiropractors from all over. I eventually saw a NUCCA Chiropractor (National Upper Cervical Chiropractic Association). I was diagnosed with a post-traumatic upper cervical subluxation. They told me I had pressure on my brainstem and the pinching of an artery going to my brain. For two years they tried to correct it to no avail. I would pop out of alignment with in days or sometime even hours after my adjustment. After two years my adrenals were shot. I was told my subluxation was so bad it was like trying to balance a bowling ball on top of a golf tee pin. So after 4 years of Chiropractic treatment and not wanting surgery, I gave up and thought I would have to live with this problem for life. I turned to massage which helped me survive.
Then miracle of all miracles I met Brian this year. He was confident he could help me. He wasn't concerned that my atlas and access was misaligned or that no one had been able to get it corrected for me. He told me, "We won't worry about your atlas till a little later. I want to start by working from the ground up so to speak. Let's make sure your hips are aligned and you are standing correctly. Then we will address your neck." I was impressed to say the least.
I felt a confidence and competence in Brian's hands I had never experienced before. It was my sixth visit before he finally adjusted my atlas and WOW... what a huge release of energy that flowed through my body when the years of pinching on my brainstem was over. And would you believe it, the adjustment stayed put and has never popped out since. If I were to go into the details of the physiological changes my body has gone through and the depths of my recovery I could write a book. But let me just say, I went in with reverse curve of my lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine. After seeing him two times a week from March through August, I am now enjoying better health than I have in the last 20 years. Everything has been corrected and aligned properly. I have never felt better. I can not say enough good about Brian. He is the best; God's gift to humanity in my humble opinion. If I could give him 10 gold stars I would. I owe him my deepest gratitude.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This place is probably the best (and most convenient) hiking park in the south bay. Plenty of different hiking paths mostly flat some with moderate slope. There are a lot of shaded trails too.< /review>

My favorite hiking spot! There are different trails of various difficulty level. One sees a lot of wild life here.
On weekends finding a parking spot can be difficult  7:30 am onwards. There is plenty of parking, though. Sometimes I go back and park on Cristo Rey drive and hike a mile (on a trail) to the Preserve which isn't a big deal.
Beautiful wild flowers in spring and, if the winters bless us with good rain, a pretty creek to throw pebbles in.</Review>

Great please for hiking with family to the farm which is approximately 1.2 miles each way. For the hard core hikers or runner, they can go up to PG&E trail and even up to black mountain. Parking is challenging on weekend.<//Text>

So many different trails to hike on and explore. Lots of trails with good shade too for hot days. Should try the pg&e trail, it’s one of the hardest ones there but really worth it for the views. There’s also a farm too, great place to take children. One downside is that parking can sometimes be impossible on busy days.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This is THE place for getting a good exercise by hiking! The wildcat loop trail has a very good elevation and is absolutely gorgeous! I totally reccommend this trail! The vista point was beautiful too! This reserve has many one-way trails due to the pandemic and they are very comfortable to be explored 😌 If you have pooches that are adventurous, then this reserve is not for them since dogs are not allowed. But it is amazing for us, humans, to get a fresh start here! The weekends are very busy though, so I reccommend coming earlier in the morning to get a parking spot! It's great for kids too, especially since they can be engaged with picnic tables that are everywhere for quick snacks and also because of the wild turkeys, deer and the cute animals in the farm located in the reserve! I also recommend you to take lots of water and snacks to stay hydrated ☺️☺️< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHg8TNTOA3xl6U5ud62Mif4Y1iJKbUyA9_ibOk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoH6LGvuOa2lqkbRbLDNoVXubgx_aCOyy3dyVP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDOAjEkGquaSUmcDvs7VBIBbvSIJ7l9si3UrDx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>Nice place to hike albeit a little long at 8+ miles if you take the high meadow trail. Lots of crowd especially in the weekends and parking gets full pretty soon. Views are not exhilarating but there are a few points to lookout for. Restrooms only near the parking lot as expected so plan accordingly. Trail is moderate and can be done by beginners as well. Deer can be spotted.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1AHTTc5MqFACEqKK5fjCNSRID5NzhLCdDk1kV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGfBkmGe3wzHxXDeb60JRFq8ssXKrPzsjdt7Qu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcz3CPX3rT99sZnymun1KXxIs71p7IObWdXOug=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoGoZgOa-DKw6h3kbiupUOZRdev6pNojU8HTkx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMICGbk4eX4R9pzoZrbs8x5fxKxXa9707Mp4BAF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-z8jup6QF78nWy_H_P4t3ep5enOn4LI-ru2D-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I have hiked every trail. Do you doubt
my conviction? The proof is the
pictures. Depending on your comfort
level you can choose your own
adventure! Bring your water,
sunglasses, trail mix, a proper hiking
hat, shoes with good insoles and a
enthusiastic mind that desires to
wander and meander FREE. The most
preserve parking spots around.
Rancho will not let you down. Rejoice!
Starting out with Deer Hollow Farm
is great. What comes next is up 2 U.</text>

Love this place for weekend hikes. Get here early because the parking lots get packed. Many trails of varying lengths good for the hiker who has an hour to those who have all day. Enjoy!< /Review>

Beautiful place, though on weekends and during covid it is actually extremely crowded, even at 9am. Parking later than that can be tricky.

The deer hollow farm is closed for the time being due to the pandemic, but sometimes you are lucky to see the animals through the fences< /Text>

The staff has done a great job creating one way trails with easy to follow signage.    Hidden in the hills of Cupertino, this is worth the drive. Beautiful views, seasonal water and a farm!(not open due to Covid). Perfect for hiking, picnics or just to relax in the open meadow area.<//Text>

This place paints a different picture, answers my different call and brings a certain comfort for me each time I need to get away from the chaos of urban living, stressful work weeks and noisy busy streets.

Though a popular spacious place and often filled with floods of people on the weekends, this space has a variety of offerings--lush greens, wandering animals, beautiful meadows, bubbling creeks, leisure paved paths and higher trails that lead to more quietude for those that crave for moments of peace and meditation.

If you're intentional about seeking out some solitude to clear your mind, listen to the sound of nature and spend a little time in contemplation while admiring God's creation right in your South Bay backyard, this place just may be a sweet gem you need without committing to a long drive--it's easily accessible and a quick ride from most of local neighborhoods.</Text>

<text>My favorite place to go hiking. There are multiple trails to choose from with great views of the Bay Area. If you go early in the morning, you're more likely to catch deer grazing. There's also a lot of wild turkeys. When it's hot out, be careful of rattle snakes sunbathing in the middle of the trail. Due to the rainy season, there's been quite a spectacular bloom of wildflowers. There are nice restrooms in the two parking lots closest to the trails and a restroom by the farm. On a good weather weekend, you'll need to come early, otherwise, expect budgeting time to hunt/wait in line for a parking spot.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNitARtoy-LNdAFjsc6LfbWVGvG0jJdCzknR64c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFQ9HDY3dHkhnbEWl5MkUGGdsjjcgd2vHevnKW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOu6Rn9snmscg78_6-tZIlIlOFc1unmvqFnGin=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe8NrJnnhfjyZFocfV_4MMLBF4_Fd-YsN1rROp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5OFOguKVuckUeAVkBJDB0krC1TwUv686kbOti=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCmhcjujhKT0B6xbKlLDSifMybLY69fZ-sm8cx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyVAj8pdeNEHNz9OWm5LjCAYDSJ6-bpSI7M07N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM71hqreYnUeRBoIJM76s2ckABL0quAoWOHv8QS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIyOFGZMiCs30hlto0UmmVYZND188lPYxwoB4q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</GmapID></record>

This is an amazing getaway right in the middle of bay area. Very easily accessible from South Bay and is hugely popular among locals. This is not a local city park, it's a natural preserve and stretches across the santa Cruz mountains and is gone to local flora and fauna, including the elusive mountain lions.

The park has many trails and thus doesn't bore you even if you are a regular. If your are training for a marathon, this is the ideal place as it has mostly shaded trails with fair amount of elevation gain. Kids are welcome and you will do many of them. Bikers are welcome too and is a great opportunity to get some mountain biking training done here.

There is also a petting farm located about a mile from the parking lot and is fin with kids. They have goats, sheep and cows.

Make sure to get early as the parking lot gets full very quickly. Or get in later when the earlier ones are leaving.<//review>

Amazing place for short and long hikes there is a farm in between that is lovely to watch if you want to separate from the crowd go towards the farm and make a left in interact the left side is more shaded and after rain you will hear and see water flow next to you if you prefer open space go right or continue straight. Bikes are only allowed untill certain extent so plan accordingly.<//review>

Great for family or seasoned solo hikers. Benches around for relaxing sits and some picnic tables for groups. Paved road for walking makes for easy treks for those of us with a bad ankle or knee. So close to home right off I280. Remember to bring water and enjoy nature.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

One of the best places in the bay area for hiking, biking, or to go visit with farm animals. The trails are well marked, and most of the reserve is accessible for kids as well. The kids will love Deer Hollow Farm where they can get close to goats, sheep, pigs. All in all a beautiful way to disconnect from the Silicon Valley and always on internet... And get closer to nature.<//Review>

Excellent ranch, very recommended for family workout with kids. Clean and well made trail for both pedestrians and bikes at all levels. What’s amazing is the delicate farm full of cows, sheep/goats, ducks and hens/roosters! We also saw wild deers and turkey close to the trails! Kids love it so much! Thanks to park/farm management and volunteers who preserve this place to be like a hiking paradise for the community! Will definitely visit more often in future!<//text>

<text>I was visiting from out of town when my manager told me that we’d go for a hike during our lunch break. Despite the rain, the hike was absolutely amazing! Beautiful views and mist drifting up the mountainside made it feel like some movie set. Plenty of wildlife: deer, turkey, quail as well as signs warning of mountain lions 😅🦁< /text><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Amazing experience. Really scenic and good walking paths. The awesome weather added to the experience. My one-year old nephew loved his evening stroll here. Saw some turkeys and deers on the way. I was taking pictures of the turkeys from a close distance and thankfully a park ranger came and warned us not to get too close as they might attack.< /text>

A very expansive hiking area with miles of incredible trails. You can choose to stay in the flats along the hillside or ascend up the hillside to experience the great Bay Area views. One of my favorite hiking areas in the Bay Area due to the variety and magnitude of trails and size of the preserve. The canyon trail and hike up to the vista point would be my favorite two in the preserve. Well worth a visit if you love to hike.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Something for everyone here.  Need a easy walk with a stroller? Yes.  Need a long climb for your Grand Canyon prep? That too.  Just want to hang out with the kids and chicks (young goats and chickens...) at the farm? Sure.

The parking is lots better since the second lot was remodeled.  If you're thinking of biking, there's a totally different route (not hilly or car-y) for you through the neighborhood in the other side of 280, it's very convenient.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFVXYoQ_Lmi2-h8kI7OcHKJvDTLuZFPL2_5VVu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNmYD-yyY9c_pXJMWB6d4m4oiq96wy3Jbek2z5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvW0OqzT5h7bFLSSwB_TU4zqgYCqFklU0CjPPY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjJP45T2ofRI3O1DAPkYULIzMqK_YSchsUHxFG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgX69ryNzMBnRYPmvpnDUlUTjVSCw0GdRna9-s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRSNK2wZeo6IZjHMuNr5E047VWUr9bk0pF-jAd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3bN0352zNR1RLfvUoq1ejyVezx_6oK6eAjnU9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsIlyaQwfbB1fx60N38bSbb4AS35qlUOcQOXIX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKKfWo6ZB10f8Cj4KiIaHgON5xKMUCIKvGgI8n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMff8KTNp6LRoh7h-FgWWO2r5Vrs1HkNO0LxdsH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Beautiful trails, some are designated one way for social distancing. Can get a little crowded on weekends.</Review>

<text>It’s a hiking trail for all ages. It has almost all kinds of trails. Greenery all around. Shades all around👌 very soothing and relaxing for eyes. They have farm to show some animals to kids. Parents take their kids there to show them cow, pig , goat, lamb, many produces like few green vegetables.

You can bring your own food and have a potluck there. I see many teams or groups go there for hiking and after that they have breakfast/lunch/evening snacks etc.

Many fitness freak people also go to this place for their running, elliptical exercises and get a feeling of nature’s lap.

During your hike you can see many deers, peacocks and many many birds chirping. Overall it gives you an amazing feeling.

I personally like this place very much and o often visit this place to do my weekend workout. I feel hiking gives you enough heart pump to get you feel that you are alive.

I strongly recommend everyone to go for walk/little hike/steep hike/ fitness minded friend get together etc. it’s a place for everyone ☺️.

Please check my clicks around this place and you will see what I am I talking.<//text>< time>

Amazing place to hangout with friends or family. You can do picnic, hiking, walking and cicling.

P.s. 4 stars because this place doesn't allow dogs :/<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Awesome workout place for different levels of fitness and training--from an almost flat 2 mile round trip to the Deer Hollow farm, to a moderate (550+ ft climb) 3 mile closed loop hike/run along Coyote trail (my favorite), to a difficult (1600+ ft climb) 9 mile closed loop hike/run along the PG&E trail.

There is a lot of parking, but this place is extremely crowded during weekends and holidays. Be prepared to wait up to 15-45 min to get parking during busy time. Definitely advise car-pooling if coming here with friends and family. Consider the 'waiting for parking' as a meditation exercise before your workout!😃

Now the best part! This place has awesome trails (especially when various streams have water running), lots of wildlife (birds, snakes, wild turkeys, deers, rabbits, and occasionally mountain lions), and multiple restrooms. The CA park rangers here are always vigilant, and helpful when needed.

The Deer hollow farm is a nice stop for small children if your are here for a casual visit. Updating (3/7/2020) with pictures from the farm (1-2 day old baby goats, and wild tom turkeys performing mating dance).

Update: May 03, 2020. Today we spotted a great blue heron in the preserve. It has been several years since we last spotted them here.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJSeKQbfo_CNw-rzr4qOqY51BgSwtEC93wt6xt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeDakOo8IOwll80vz92zY7BEMKKkvN6T3bGZiN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8cq0SAKtq_zTkD7-V62Z1TaF1rw3mjhr7BUV-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb_WC9yxsKkRkcDQIEWrI4i9Bi5lhxGGmsDgeL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVzuid7h3OSaFUzC_1Rqh0dwW4uXyin3J8a3Q1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjDANraVTuZqziYGydno1hc0pen2TDWu0OJjC4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBzB-KtH9_SQ0_vYheyBpUEg99Gh7WJtbI5WSP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfuP0dJzgZo4N3LzAQhC3EkZLFf7U3cCGIWTpf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFq6kVspzQ9ifVpHwMNjOtvqKXEycAd5_EPIjf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtvuIITFeERJ196I6rP3SMghqm9btMJsbF_GzK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRdv6DhGTXPhz6-DOXMUmaUBonbP3ACMZwKxRV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxIx0RYqmdwuDHMkwUM0eFwo8GcnJO-r0cbp0z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlt9bjZaZwei9gH0ulAocoHGQpb0OP21qEphL8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPo5t5WURvPWsQ7SPJg_d0oUHm9fndSgLpwTc9D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtReZ5HKeikPMSA_BlB-oKYxTgq5UDykqNn3V6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8bVus-J69TOsYK-ixlHritavuAl48doXs3s2G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6y6pgLze-CtBQxlPVO9euIfCfwzZgOT5KKmgS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZog_O0Lnc3hq01MNGgWyzlC-khbJ7tOM5tjpB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuK4rU5j4MjKecg92ygBgctUTMYGFgs2hH4W7D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMITFjgWS37Op90dA-M8PEEZ5eTAoADLKKHrl0_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoRgNRhNN1ls51wbTg_-YXVXnWOGGz8JPSihPv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuuV2UKs1auDhCNlvvbGKjrv2YnuLQWihAJYh-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWpxSAtzF7BpYvsW15BUut_dcy08BCNHQyF-GC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXStTODku2bybdWICuEhFNwpF_2aMhKWm6zNmw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTxVrNj5smY-qBjonzc1xoVLeBz_SREMikX4EG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3v2W9K3GyAoKjvC9TQipHT5BgVvcU6fFqrXcB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk1CgKOUMLZod9yR1MUaDTLdLwIjuVOkmd5ThG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4vIjPueJgAVPdk8suCNcWoc6AH6Y0T-evrmT5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPifPERXeGHJ3kZ__Ken57F9WFuWnKqw7lFgjY1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT1H9D6fhECLbk_DOMva8Ijez2krfESTDQbuEr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2knw5AiE34jn3yBxRwK2uDLCbS0fHwxZySzwX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp1-tQ8dwvtIhQ32e5je_A_r8S3l_BTkAx4AcZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUhKTTg9clH7ewfup9ENMkTk3G7WZ04I5BAve9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgKz2D0DE7RZM-BKM4OskoyuBfcH07qiykXdXK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjAnp4yBvnIQZpQcZP6JQZnMxfJCY0UoqnWmaL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW2zTiOAyov0C6QGIg-65M2qoNFmRi2AnHVJ3v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_mQuyaXWjlxyLpPCy8ubOBCU995bC7CP-3JE0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAvBoN9muvHw-pkTd1QRJvEiRk667tv9wsXUgA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAMuT-SiHIXrndsoy7BUqN3yG1kI-w2A6Jwl6U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>One of the best to go go hiking, if you one a long long trail this is the place to go. They have parking for the cars and then you can go hiking, but remember go with water, because is hard to find a place to buy it there. Beautiful mountain.< /Review>< date>

<text>Awesome trails for all types of runners, hikers. Steep hills for gruesome LT workout, downhill well paved trails for constant low impact form work.
Been there twice for trail running/ hiking, no complaints, restrooms are quite well maintained too.
It gets dark in some areas of the trails due to trees so make sure you check sunset time before starting your hike/ run.
Climbed 1600, still so much more to go.

Starting at PG&E is better in my opinion as there are more gravel sections which are easier for uphill. Coming down on Coyote is better due to more smooth downhill and no gravel.

Lookout for small tree roots sticking out in the trails, they can be deceivingly high, I tripped on one coming downhill, not a pleasant experience.</text>< Pictures>

<review>This is an overall great place for outdoor activities...
Great hiking trails, picnic areas, lots of parking options, well kept, dedicated area for RC plane flying, lots of wildlife, and a farm with a diverse range of animals for people to interact with as a bonus.
I highly recommend!</review><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmap_id>< userid>

<Text>It’s a great family and kids friendly trial with many trails at various terrains. Free parking but be early to get a spot. Enough restrooms and water fountains.

Animal farm is a mile away from parking lot and everyone loves to witness it. Close to nature just 5-10 miles away from Sunnyvale or Cupertino.<//Text>< pictures>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Kalim Moghul< /username><text>Beautiful views and fairly well maintained trails make this a great place for hiking or biking. There's a modestly sized flying field for radio control airplanes and the like. Parking is plentiful, though it got a bit crowded later in the afternoon. Social distancing was not difficult and mask discipline was fairly good if not perfect. Narrower trails have been marked one way to promote distancing, so it's a good idea to consult the map posted at the trail head.<//text>< UserId.>

There are many good short hikes here, and at some view points you can see a view of the south bay and peninsula.  You can also do longer hikes up black mountain, to Rhus ridge or Hidden Villa.  There is a good mix of trails with varied terrain.  Scenery are green after rain, but otherwise some parts are quite yellow in the summer and fall.</text>

A nice park. There's a good variety of trails - easy ones by the parking lot and tougher ones farther in. The trails have a mix of open views and wooded sections. The farm is neat too. Parking can be tough though.< /Text>

<text>Beautiful area. Lots of wildlife to see. Must visit at least once. Lots of nice hikes for all difficulty levels. Some hikes are also stroller friendly.

Make sure to bring sufficient water/ electrolytes.

Always watch your step in the hikes. I have seen people fall and get injured.</text>< Time>

If you're planning for weekend hike, parking is limited inside the reserve.

<text>Lovely easy nature paths with a sweet creek next to the walking.  Well maintained and my favorite,  the petting zoo after a reasonable over one mile walk. Animals are well cared for,  a very kind docent that was very happy to explain that area and the history. WHAT MYSTIFIED me were the 3 dead wild turkeys we encountered driving away from the place, in the open field across the street from the park. There's bike paths with various levels of difficulty as well as other paths for walking.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

Great place to hike. Very accessible - stroller and wheelchair friendly. Maps, restroom, water fountains available. Parking is very tough on weekends though - come early or circle around to get lucky. There is an old animal farm there as well - kids love it.<//text>

I went on a Tuesday morning between 7am and 10am. It wasn’t too busy, just enough people to feel safe hiking on my own. The view from Vista Point is worthwhile and a relatively short hike from the farm and entrance.  Saw tons of wildlife and enjoyed the canyon trails and high meadows. Would suggest wearing layers as the temperature change can be quite drastic from trail to trail.< /text>

<Review>The parking lot was busy but seeing as it’s a huge park you can have the trail to yourself. Loved the accessibility -saw both elderly and tots enjoying the lush oaks/trails and babu animals at the farm.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmapID></record>

<Text>We picked an easy trail.  Round trip was only 2.5 miles.  This was our first family hike since...forever.  at the end of our hike to Deer Hollow Farm, there was a nice little educational shack that kids can learn fun facts about the animals around the area.<//Text>< Date>

<Review>It consists of lot of trails with dense trees. If you are planning to take a longer one (black mountain trail) carry sufficient water as there is no water source anywhere. It is a good hike.< /Review>< date>

<Review>Did the wild cat loop early morning. Parking is a big problem. Come early as possible because one literally has to wait 20mins or more to see if someone is coming back. I reached at 7:05 and it was all packed with 4 cars ahead of me waiting. Trail is nice and moderate level.<//Review>< Pictures>

Best place to hike. Has all levels of hike. Mobile Network coverage is good through out. Difficult to find parking. Restroom available at the trial head. There is a small farm for kids to see farm animals. Also, has a launch area for remote controlled air planes.</Text>

<Review>Great place to go for hikings.
Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic trails are now just one way so you are forced to walk more.
For me that's great but for others who aren't in great shape it might be difficult.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//Gmap_id></record>

Enjoyed the hike. Very nice place to start the day. Could spot many deer along the trails. There are multiple trails for hiking. Ample of parking available at the entry. Park opens at 6 in morning (after sunrise) and usually remains crowded on weekends.  One can reach there in 15-20 minutes from Mountain View in early morning.

<text>Beautiful open space and trails. We went a bit close to sunset so had to rush, but will definitely return! We did a loop hike that was about 2.5 miles. Perfect for our five-year old. She loved the farm!

Deer Hollow farm loop trail is an easy trail, where the trail paths are well constructed roads. you can take your children along ,and they can ride their scooters as well.
There is a nice ranch created at the end of the trail. The ranch has sheeps ,goats ,baby lambs, turkeys,cows and pigs.
There is a small museum near the Deer Hollow farms , the museum has display of stuffed and preserved animals including red fox, owls, eagles , mountain lions and many more. You will also enjoy the touch table with bones, feathers, leaves,  seeds , fur ,nests and more< /text>

Love this park. Great trail runnning there. Get there early on the weekends! Gets packed very quickly. Also, try the Coyote Creek trail as an alternative to the more popular PG&E trail. Here's a photo I took from top of PG&E trail.<//Review>

<text>Open free to the public 365 days a year. Open 30 mins before sunrise to 30 mins after sunset.

No dogs allowed.
Helmets required for bikes/scooters/etc (even for adults).
No drones allowed. Fix winged RC aircraft allowed at the runway. (Located near the main entrance).

Parking is competitive on the weekends, easier on week days.

Some beautiful trails, the deeper you go in the less people you encounter.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUN76_NVaVPhqL5Aknu-R12wjc_jY17KfFCITb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYow0mIdQ_h156CB7zkhbOERQbz66bNdHMLULr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPl-DPxAcE8ARAL1RI5L5TzjWIbeCxI807gUf4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0CgOxSKZ1ShytosJAzMEyqBs_XlJgJnHirGCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwUd-MtD76_Qcqy83-hzkQ07IivA7DTqGesU32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtnoUefSgp9sw0H1o2wDKCuHFm7HL5jpsEtnog=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcpdv19qTzg6HNfHkuIDFeGfJKsr57NjHMhY9S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq2sFbR2uH6OwkMraVprocDSg5ZWGxBR-N0SRG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGDfKHHbGf1ugQvYg5qsFq-CzwZdMkqPeRiXdn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgtUGtTNmYJIdAamnTdemZC-2Df2k3t7P_uQPq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORhVmfP3BUHqKgMIpVQ23rJDLXz2Bi5wpnK233=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm0_TjZdci4pqjniCIdrWJoEZZI_KIW7DdWVyt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3m8ljpWIBb5K6EMWYlQsl9RlLK05c4l24sa9U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<Review>This is my favorite place for hiking especially in feb-apr. The creek is flowing and I love it.
There are couple of trails. Also there is a farm which is an attraction for little kids. Usually takes about 1:30 -2 hrs for wild cat loop hike. There are longer hikes available too.
Parking is not exactly limited but it is favorite spot so its hard to find parking no matter what time of day you go.<//Review></record>

Good place to visit for trail lovers, be careful while bringing your children as during summer time you can see snakes near the grass/bushy places. Also there are warning of mountain lion. As we trail we have seen deers and also some creepy sounds inside the forest. Really must try place. But please bring water to keep yourself hydrated.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>This is a great place to hike, bike or run trails. There are trails for every level. Plenty of parking spots with three parking lots. Water fountains are at the Equestrian Parking Lot and the main parking lot at the bottom of the entrance road. It opens earliest in the Summer at 5:30 am depending on the month. It closes at Sunset. My favorite trails are Coyote Trail, Upper Wildcat Loop, Black Mountain Trail, High Meadow Trail and Stephen Arbors Trail which most locals know as PG & E Trail.</review>< gmap_id>

This is the most beautiful hiking place. I have been there almost every weekend for the past 18 years. I saw deers, turkeys, coyotes, snakes, but not mountain lions yet. You can adjust your paces according to your own strengths. Slots of trails for you to pick.</Text>

Raw nature and beautiful scenic trails that provide walk through both wilderness and open views. Took wildcat loop trail through the vista point. Car parking could get tricky, so better to arrive around sunrise. Will definitely come back to explore more.< /Review>

This is a go to hiking place if you live in Cupertino, Saratoga and near by areas. There are plenty of trails here. Place is generally busy. Even though there are lot of parking, it can be hard to find parking in the mornings, since it  is a extremely popular hiking spot. PG&E trail is one of the popular trails. You can bring children to show farm animals, there is a picnic area near the farm as well. Great place to visit if you are a hiking enthusiast.< /Review>

Nice park that's easy to get to and typically has plenty of parking. There are a few different routes you can take, but your choices are limited. The trails are mostly exposed. There's western poison oak in every conceivable spot off of the trail, so don't do any bushwhacking here.</Review>

Deer hollow farm is a popular destination for families with young kids. You can walk or bike there (separate paths). On weekends parking is difficult due to the popularity.</review>

Great place to connect with nature and farm life. Park close to the 280 bridge, and walk in to a system of small stroller friendly hikes leading to a farm with goats, chicken and other animals - that kids would love. There is a small picnic area too (restrooms are smelly).
If you want a more strenuous hike, there are trails that lead all the way up the mountain (or around it) and provides some good views from the top.< /text>

Parking was always a problem. During May shelter in place, parking is STILL a problem. Other than that, always a relaxing place to walk around.< /review>

Good hikes around a park, PG&E trail might be full of people and not super easy, but it deserves to spend two hours of going up</Review>

Ranch I San Antonio is a mixed bag overall. There are many great trails to hike, but parking is a nightmare over.

They have done a great job of trying to make many trails one way, but many people violated this. The one way trails also made it difficult to plan a hike as we didn’t know which ones were one way before we came upon them. This not anyone’s fault, but something to know.

It is pretty here and we did see some deer as well l, which is always great, but we likely will hike elsewhere until after the pandemic.<//text>

Very good place in a good weather, during covid they made one-direction trails to reduce number of close contacts, which is good as well. Trails are short and long, for any levels, good environment for kids. The rancho itself is closed for now unfortunately.
In a rainy weather it cood be dirty, so check forecast.< /Review>

<Text>Very popular park - parking lot will get full as early as 6:30am. Come early and be prepared to wait.

Cars usually queue to get a parking, please be considerate and get in the line. Also, parking is first come first serve. You cannot stand on a spot to hold a place for your family. That’s not how it works here.

Always a fun time in this park. Lovely sceneries and great trails to really exercise and enjoy nature.

<text>When we pulled in the parking lot was mostly empty so it appeared to be safe to hike. People on the trail were wearing masks and keeping social distance. The farm is closed for safety. Bathrooms are open for hand washing, etc. The start of the trail has a lot of sun so bring a hat/sunscreen.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This is one of favour parks in the Bay area.  There are lots of hiking trails for all levels.  I have been hiking on the PG&E trail for the last 15 years and never got tired of it.  There are lots shades, ups and downs.  Almost every turn is a new scenary.  I just love it.< /Review>

Great beginner friendly trails, nice location. You can also visit the Deer Hollow Farm and don't miss the small cabin there, it houses several taxidermied animals, animal skeletons and other artifacts.</Text>

Beautiful and big park... Only downside is that it can be hard to find parking when it's really busy.  But once you're in the park, it's lovely.  The farm is a big hit with our kids.< /Text>

Be prepared for a crowd on the weekends, but if you're an early riser and want to run some trails the views can't be beat so close to civilization. The Chamise Trail to Black Mountain Trail is highly recommended for a11 mile loop.</Review>

This is perfect place for walking, running, cycling, picnic or drone flying. They have spearate path for cyclers at many places. The area is huge and connects more then 10-20 trails. They have barn also inside which was a nice surprise for us. There are multiple places for picnic too. They have 3 parking lots, the first and second one are small but the last parking lot at the bottom is big. They have drone flying zone near first and second parking lot. This is the default place if I am not able to find a good trail to go for a weekend run, thus I have been here multiple times.<//Text>

<review>I would give this place a 5 but parking is EVIL.  There's hardly ever any parking,  bring a lucky person with you when you visit.  If you're able to secure a spot, you'll enjoy this place.  It's good for families and kids and there's a small farm with goats and chickens.

Good place for long distance runs, varying surfaces and good for trail running<//review>< Name>

<review>This trail is so nice and peaceful. Many trail and has a animal farm for kids to play in. Beautiful color changing tree leaves. It can be cold or super hot defending g where you're hiking, make sure you have enough water. PG&E trail is very long and some part are pretty hard.

They recently created One Way routes for most -used narrow trails in respect to "social distancing", so go to the home main page to take a look at the trail maps for new/diverted routes before planning your hike or....just follow the new One Way signs when you encounter them.

Lots of trails and great views and the farm is a nice touch, but the parking here has gotten worse with time. At 8:30 this morning all the lots were full.

The bit of the trail that’s under construction is said to open later this year in 2020, and hopefully there’s more parking then.< /review>

Excellent location for hiking. Several trails and picnic locations. Also saw much wildlife. Hawk, turkeys and a small snake. There is also a farm along the trails.< /Text>

Very easy hike, at least the first mile to the farm.  Our hike today included an encounter with a rattle snake. It was in the intersection of several popular trails so the park rangers moved it to a safer location. It was also a nice lesson for the kids that “we are in their house”.< /Text>

A good mix of paved trails for bikes and strollers and hiking trails. It also had a small farm with cows, sheep, chickens etc. For the kids. A family of deer laying around is great too.</Text>< user_id>

Urban hiking, Parking can be tough at busy times. PGE trail is arduous takes about 3 hours but lots of other smaller loops and trails. Can be crowded at times.<//review>

This preserve and the trails were my regular weekly haunt years ago. Went back to see how it's changed - 7:40 am on a Sunday morning - and i found the lower parking lot completely full. Saw a few cars occupying two slots, now that's on them.

This preserve has a variety of trails - there is one that will match your own desire for level of activity. From the parking lot, you can tell this is a very popular place - so if you like walking with lots of people, kids, babies in strollers, joggers, this is the place to be! If not, there are hundreds of trails in dozens of open space preserves in the south bay...<//Text>

<Text>Went for the first time this weekend with a friend and hiked a decently inclined hill, so I noticed if folks wanted a even easier trek there were some nice flatland trails as well. It was pretty populated but that wasn't surprising since it's so close to town but it was a gorgeous get away and we saw so many little cottontails and deer off in the distance. My favorite wildlife surprise was the rafter of turkeys we saw close to sunset! It was also need to see people flying there model plains out there. The people watching was just as good as the walking!< /Text><UserId.>107835787179343434998<//UserId.><Name>Amie Regester</Name><rating>5</rating>< resp>

<review>Nice ranch! Lots of beautiful wildlife. I would recommend going there but stay on trail as there are lots of snakes and I once accidentally got near one while staying on trail, so be careful there don’t go in the bushes while hiking.
There at the entrance is a parking lot and bathroom. Another nice thing is that when you get inside the rancho there is a huge plain and on it is a picnic area shaded by a large tree.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /Gmap_id></record>

Rancho has miles of well-maintained trails, all marked with signs to keep you going in the right direction. You'll get to see a variety of plant and animal life here, from bay trees to California thrashers. Keep an eye out for interesting mushrooms, too. Got kids? They'll love the working farm, which keeps chickens, goats, and pigs. Parking can be difficult, especially on weekend mornings.</Review>< Pics>

Plenty of nice hiking trail. No matter how fit you are, you should find something adapted. There is also a nice farm that kids should enjoy.</review>

Have been running here twice a week for almost 20 years. Many trails, short and long, can take you up all the way to Black Mountain (about 16 miles round trip, 2500ft climb). A lot of wildlife to see, primarily deer and turkeys, some birds, and occasionally a coyote. Easy access, however parking can be challenging at popular visit hours.< /review>

As a hike, it's pretty easy. A fair amount of wildlife (mostly turkeys, other birds, rabbits, deer, etc.), and on most days, there's a nice view of the valley. Parking can be difficult on weekend mornings.</Text>

<Text>From casual intensity flat trails to Deer Hollow farm, to strenuous hills on the PG&E trail, this park provides a wide variety of hiking experiences. Frequent sightings of wild turkeys and deer. Magnificent views of South Bay from several vistas.

Can be difficult to get a parking spot on good weather weekend afternoons.<//Text>< rating>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We went on Sunday afternoon! A lot of people! Recently they are making some of the trails one-way so people don’t have to run into each other. However the “one-way” instructions are a bit confusing because some of them are not one way and they might be connected to one-way trails without further instruction . We end up walking into a one-way trail with wrong direction and was very embarrassed when people come tell us that we are in the wrong direction. Beautiful scenery though!< /Review>< Pictures>

Amazing trails around here. This place has plenty of parking (there are many lots but still you come late, you will find it hard to get one). I did the wild cat loop trail which was really good. There is a short one you can do or make it longer, depends on how much distance you want to go. The moment to trail the trails at entrance, there are maps detailing the route. I THINK you can also go to the Black Mountain through one of the trail paths!< /review>

The place is great for a day hike or a morning run to the top of the mountain. The first 3km are pretty flat. After that is all uphill. Trees become more scarce half way to the top so is a good idea to wear susncreen and glasses. Parking gets very crowded very early in the morning during weekends. If you want to make sure to find parking arrive before 6am. Bathrooms are located in the parking lot and water fountains are available. There is also a small farm where you can buy organic eggs and other vegetables.</Text>

Nice open space preserve run by the city of mountain view. Plenty of parking (although it can be quite tough to find parking during peak park hours), free entry, some really good hikes. This preserve has something to offer for all. Deer hollow farm and small hikes for the young ones. PG&E and black mountain for anyone looking for a longer hike. High meadow Vista point hike if you want a quick hike for the day. Almost always spot deer and turkey on the trails when we hike here.<//Text>

A few long trails. Some are uphill, and requires some good lungs! There is a tennis court 1/2 mile in on the north side on a trail and that one leads to the petting zoo as well. The trails uphill are long and it's best to do them in the early AM...when it's not so hot. It can get VERY hot there. Not alot of tree cover on many areas on the trails. They have bathrooms by one parking lot only. We have seen a rattle snake there and bunnies, wild Turkeys etc.Views are great over the valley when up on the trails. Nice few hours in the woods. For being in CA, it's not too bad! Bring LOTS of water!</Text>

Great place for a hike. Many families come during the weekend so it can get crowded. The farm is a popular place for the kids. The trails are for all skill levels although some areas can be pretty steep. some areas also good for wedding photography, and mountain biking.</Text>

<text>Its beautiful to be sure and lots of chances to see different wildlife at a leisurely pace, but the limited parking compared to the massive numbers of potential clientele makes the parking a nightmare. If you don't go early, especially on weekends, you'll end up stalking parking spaces for leavers for ages.<//text><Name>Ivan Sanchez</Name>< GmapID>

Absolutely a running/walking heaven. Anything from a cute little walk to the farm with kids to a 17miles hike/run and anything in between. They have maps when you enter so really easy to navigate and choose the right route for you. My favorites are: to the farm and upper Wildcat for about a 7 miles loop. Enjoy!</review>

< Review>
I really enjoy this trail. Easy to get to. Lots of parking. Good trails. Not a ton of people.

Let's start from the beginning. Parking. This reserve has a lot of full sun areas so most people are here before 9am on weekends. They have multiple lots, but the bottom most lot is the largest and is closest to the reserve entrance and bathrooms. The closer to 9am you get there, the harder it'll be to find a spot.

As for the trails itself, wear trail running shoes or sneakers you're okay with getting dirty. It's all dirt paths. Also watch out for horse poop.

Bikers are allowed in parts but dogs are not. Parking is also free.

They have bike lanes but they're not labeled well so everyone just walks wherever. It's never been a problem when I've been there though because the paths are wide.

As for the trails itself. There's a lot of shorter ones that when combined, become longer hikes. We've always gone to the lookout points so you get a 4 mile uphill climb to about 1000ft, then 4 miles back down. You can combine some so they're 11-13 miles if you want something longer or more difficult. Same with the other way around. You can stay on the flatter beginning path for an easier walk.

As for the sights, they got it going on. Lookout trails have beautiful views. Tons of nature, hills and views like the Apple donut campus, NASA building and redwood City salt mines (are they mines?... Lake?...)... They also have goats. So that's cute.

Most trails are part sun and part shade so wear breathable clothing, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen. I've definitely seen some women wearing very little because of the heat, but they're beat red and don't even realize how burnt they are.

Trails are pretty wide for the most part. A few spots where we walk single file because of hikers coming the other way. These are not trails for strollers. If you bring one, stick to the easy flat part only, don't attempt the harder hikes because of the elevation.

They have bathrooms at the lowest level parking lot, and two portapotties further in on the flat area. No bathrooms higher up.

Overall, it's a really nice hike that's quiet and challenging but not too long. I also like that the first half is uphill while the second part is downhill. I've definitely done it the other way and that's less fun.</Review>

<text>When we got there, most of the trails were closed due to mountain lion activity. I would certainly like to have explored more. The trails we were on, we're not as shady as we are used to, so I prefer some of my other trails. Nevertheless if this place were open I imagine it would be quite delightful.<//text>< Name>

Be sure to go on a week day morning if you want a parking space. Trails get busy on weekends, sometimes with large noisy groups and even some people carrying mini-boom boxes while hiking. If all you want is a noisy place to walk please spare the rest of us the noise and go to the mall. Let the rest of us escape from the hustle bustle of city Life and enjoy the peace and quiet of nature.</Review>

I have been there twice ! It is always fun to go there with friends or family and have experiences together. It is recommended if you have never been here. Good to be out in summer to have a great picnic and fun with family. Water rides are amazing too. Park is huge and can keep you busy the whole day.<//review>

This is a great place! There are historical exhibits at the farm and Ohlone village, plus miles of trails to hike that vary from easy to not so easy. I recommend lots of water and sunscreen if you're going to do any of the longer hikes though.<//Text>

Usually ultra-crowded in the weekend, and hard to find parking if you go there after 8a. There are many trails, for all levels. Bring your bottle full of water with you though, because you won't find any fountain if you get half mile away from the parking lot</Text>

Great trails here, yet too many people on a weekend. Stick to higher elevations and steep trails to avoid the crowd. Nice flat garden area with animals. Check out the goats! Parking can be a challenge.<//review>

Come here often. Love that there are flat trails along with longer, more difficult incline trails. Cute farm for kids (and adults!). Parking is difficult to find but worth the effort.</review>

Great for hiking.  Watch out if your car is parked in the lot after park closes.  You will get a ticket.  Deer Hollow Farm is a sweet spot for farm animals.</Text>

< review>
I have been hiking in the Bay Area for years and Rancho San Antonio remains my #1 place to hike. They have 3 parking areas but they can fill up on weekends and holidays causing you to have to wait for people to leave. There are a number of trail options but hiking to the top via the PG&E trail gives you the best workout and the best view. The trail has a good amount of shade so even on the warmest days you will get some relief. If you hike early enough you might see some deer and wild turkeys. There are always a good number of people there so you won’t feel as though you are out in the wilderness by yourself.<//review>

<Text>A convenient park for elevation and distance training. Quick one-hour loops to comfortable half-day hikes. Preferable to Mission Peak for hot and cloudless days thanks to shade on many stretches of trail. The animal farm is a popular attraction (but not always open). Trails are muddy after rain. Reception is pretty solid throughout the park. Parking is free, but can be a challenge on swell days. Restrooms available at trailheads.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great for all walkers/hikers! This area has many different trails with different difficulties. Most trails are loops and there are maps you can pick up on your way in to plan your route. I really like the Rogue Valley trail for a moderate hike, but I never get tired of exploring and trying new trails. There's a lot of parking, but it does tend to fill up - don't worry though if it says "Parking Full" when you get there, people are always leaving and I've never not found a parking spot.</text>

<Review>This park is one of my favorites to go for a quick hike/bike ride. It’s suitable and easy enough for all ages. There are great trails and some amazing views. Every time I go, there are deers and turkeys roaming around everywhere.
There are multiple lots for you to park at. Parking on weekdays doesn’t seem to be too bad, but on weekends I recommend getting there early (like before 8am).<//Review>< pics>

I always go running here, every chance I get. Its a great place to just get away and enjoy ones peace at mind. I've been going here ever since I was a youngster with my mom, dad, and sister.
Now I go buy myself just to run. Usually I go Thursday's and Friday's.< /Text>

Popular, expansive park... great for trail running (with challenging climbs), lots of groups hiking & running... avoid weekend mornings, unless you get there pretty early... you'll be driving around a while looking for a place to park...the 5(!) parking lots fill up quickly.  Family friendly animal farm on-site, with cows, goats, ducks, and hungry chickens (which they let older kids feed).  Docents around to educate you.  Yes, cows are really huge up close...</text>

It's an awesome outdoor loci where it has something for everybody. I see folks flying drones and model planes on the upper fields next to a paved parking area. As you drive down the road l, there're more parking spots; and there's a public restroom in the middle of the parking lot that I consider clean and no signs of drug use. Rangers patrol this area quite often, they're knowledgable and eager to help. There are multiple trails but every one but the Black Mountain Trail (high elevation gain) is easy. Not into hiking? No worries. There's an animal farm in the area too so everyone is welcomed!</text>

Simply one of my favorite places to hike in Bay Area. You can wander for hours in the valley or do 20 miles with significant climbs.</review>

<Text>Such a wonderful place to hike. There are flat trails that are good for strollers and more inclined trails if you want something harder. I've only gone with my baby so I've stuck with the easier hikes, but it looks like there's plenty for a real hike.

My son loves seeing the turkeys and deer wandering around.</Text><Time>1548014973093< /Time><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//GmapID><user_name>Adrienne Tegreeny</user_name>< rate>

It is kids friendly park where there is Deer Hallow Farm which is a petting zoo and open for everyone. There is a hiking trail of round trip around 4.6 from parking lot to the Vista point. The Vista point has a nice view looking towards south Bay.  Park is very beautiful and green, especially after the rain.</Review>< pics>

Very nice hiking trail with well preserved nature. Combine some trails, we can make different length and difficulty level trails. Along the trail, we can see many insects, lizards, deers and wild  turkeys.  Around farm gets a bit crowded with many children. It is nice working farm and number of farm animals out all the time. There are a few parking areas, however so many people visit the park, parking can be challenge especially on weekends.</text>

There is a small farm at the bottom of the field, which houses sheeps, goats, hens, and rabbits. The hike has some shaded and some non- shaded areas, so it could be a little sunny on a hot day. Overall, it is a great hike!</Review>< Pictures>

Always has been a great place to hike.  The PG&E trail has been popular for decades, but I had to inform some new timers the name was changed.
Because of the popularity of hiking local trails there is a big problem finding parking even with the new lot and bathroom built last year.<//text>

Is a good place for a simple walk and a small farm. LOTS of flies and wasps. Bring lots of water because the water fountains are dirty and covered in wasps. You will end up bit by a mosquito (or a thousand).< /Review>

If you come before 4 pm you get to interact with farm animals. That's always fun for kids and adults alike. There are plenty of hikes for all levels. To top it all, we almost always encounter deers, brush rabbits, California quails, and turkeys.</review>

<Text>I love walking here. Very peaceful and away from the city madness. Excellent place for walking, running and bike riding. A lot of trails. In my walk today, I came across deer, wild turkeys, a rabbit, small lizards, and a small green snake with red stripes!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Many different trails by distance, shadow/sun, altitude difference. There is a deer farm with different animals, which can be interesting for kids.</Review>

This is a beautiful place for hikes, picnics, runs, bike rides with family and friends, weekends and weekdays. Hide up to Vista Point from the many trails options, and see a great view of the valley. Even SF and Oakland are visible on a clear day. You can see deer, squirrels, lizards, rabbits, snakes, turkeys, and bluejays. Bobcats and mountain lions have also been sighted. The farm is great-pigs, goats, cows, herbs, flowers. This place is on my favorites list. Parking can be hard but with patience, you can get a space.</review>

<Review>I love the trails BUT hate parking here. People will just wait at an enterence until a spot opens up and cause everything to back up. I wish they have better security circling around to make people move or have signs that say no waiting/stopping. I would just park on the streets and walk all the way to the trail. It's far but at least you don't have to deal with that.<//Review>< Pictures>

S.Antonio rancho is a wonderful  place to hike
It is very safe and pleasant place to walk. My wife and I are using the park for many years except on weekends where it's impossible to go because you can't park due to the crowds.</Review>

I only go here a lot because I deliver gift baskets to The Forum Retirement Center as new tenant or special occasion gifts.
This foothill area is basically a large percolation Farmers pond that is being totally rebuild and rejuvenated and the surrounding area is expensive high-end homes, as well as high-end Retirement Community,<//text>

To be honest, I have known Rancho San Antonio since childhood and the park has always served quite a few purposes. I never really used the tennis courts or the exercise structure but I have heavily relied on the decently sized flying field and the brilliant hiking trails that this park has to offer.

I wish I could give this place a 5 star review but ever since they added the strict rules and regulations for the flying field, it never was quite the same as it was for decades on end.< /text>

Such a beautiful place I kinda hate to tell everyone how nice it is because I'd like to keep it a better secret.  If you want the perfect place to get out of the city without driving for hours this is your place.  Great clean tails with and without elevation,  some paved and some dirt.  Great for hiking, biking, picnicing and mostly relaxing.  There's a nicely mowed grass airfield with wind velocity and wind socks for flying your model planes,  helicopters or drones.  Public bathrooms are available at the beginning of the trails and more just after Deer Farm where the is a petting and viewing area of all the animals.  Parking is the only down side. And it's not terrible.  Early in the day and later in the day it's never a problem. I'm just thankful they haven't wiped away more nature to pave more parking.  If you enjoy the outdoors this is your place... but don't tell anybody else let's keep this gem a secret!<//review>

Great spot to check out nature, free, and free parking. What more to ask for in life? We hiked the trail with a 3 year old and he did fine. Also, we hiked all the way to the farm. Live animals, free to visit. Fantastic.<//text>

I could use a better map. It most likely me but I get lost a lot. Take kids but keep their bikes on the paths you do not want to run over a poor little snake. Stay on paths and you will have no problems. It has a great area and people flying planes and drones. I recommend this park highly never gets old.< /review>

I've been here a couple of times and I always love it. It's a nice hike through the trails and when you get higher up you can see a lot of the silicon valley. You get some cool tree shade throughout a part of the hike on the wildcat loop trail.There are bathrooms & water fountains at the very last parking lot.  Keep in mind though that the parking lots get pretty full especially on the weekends.< /Text>

This is my favorite place to run and  hike. You will see an abundance of beautiful terrain and have some really nice pushes for cardio burn. There is an abundance of wild life as well- wild turkeys, predatory birds, salamanders, deer and maybe, hopefully not though, mountain lion. Bring water. Bring vibes. Bring family. Being your horse even.<//Text>

<review>One of the easier hiking options in Bay Area. Parking is an issue. I came at 7 am and had to roam for 40 minutes to get a parking. You have options for hiking, from 3 miles to 10 miles. And not very tiring too. Pretty plain. Very good for moderate workout.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I was hiking an someone asked me for directions and I led them straight where the wanted to go. It is a beautiful place. I am so blessed to live in a town with such a beautiful space to take a leisurely walk or a hard-core uphill hike. Rancho is an amazing park and I hope I will be able to enjoy for years to come.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Took our kids here a few times and it's always a fun time. From spotting wildlife to checking out Deer Hallow Farm and climbing on trees the whole family is entertained. There are multiple hikes and a wide variety of difficulty which is great as if both kids are on foot we stick to flat ones that they can handle. Highly recommend checking it out!<//review>

Nice, shady trails. You can do a short farm loop, or long hikes with beautiful views. The farm has pigs, goat, sheep, etc.
Parking situation is not great in weekends even though there is a lot of parking since it's a very popular spot. Arrive early morning or around 1 PM to find easier parking.< /Review>

This place is great.  Excellent hiking trails. Both easy and harder trails are available.  This is a great place to take kids.  You can hike a little and stop at a small farm to see goats, pigs, chickens and other small animals. Lots of open space.< /Text>

<text>A remarkable park!! Lots of different levels of hikes, there's one for every skill level. Parking lot to farm - great for toddlers, go past farm towrds wild cat loop trail - beginners but make sure you turn back before the hills, mid level you can go up the hill but turn back before the last extremely steep hill. PGE trail (Abbors trail) - a difficult hike but even there you can turn it into a mid hike but crossing over near the first electric pole on hike, but if you continue make sure you really are used to a difficult hike. TAKE WATER!!

The views of the valley are spectacular with a lot of photo ops if you are into that.< /text>< Pics>

A great place to go trail running, be prepared to encounter plenty of walkers here. Can connect to other parks to create a long distance course if you take the proper trails.< /Review>

The trails are are hilly and full of people; kids on bikes or kids running around, adults walking in groups, etc. It is very hard to find parking here; Uber or bike or show up at dawn, or just go somewhere else. Deer Hollow farm is in a canyon that is 10 degrees colder than the surrounding area so bring gloves and extra layers in the winter if you get cold easily. You can usually see deer here and sometimes turkeys. There are some views of the South Bay if you hike a few miles.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Different trails to explore. Each has its own beauty and difficulty level varies. Every trail is suited for hike across all the seasons. You can see wild life like dears, turkeys, wild squirrels and other species. Go either early or late to get parking. Yes , valley looks beautiful from vista point.<//Review>

<text>The open space preserve is adjacent to the Rancho San Antonio county park. Lots of easy hiking trails through pretty terrain. Look for deer, coyote, and occasional mountain lions. Parking is very difficult on weekends, so come early if you must bring your car. Bicycles are not allowed on dirt trails.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Plenty of trails with nice views of the bay; trees provide plenty of shade during the summer; water flowing in the creeks during spring; for kids there's Deer Hollow Farm with animals.< /review>

<Text>We took the shortest hike because we have a stroller. It was easy and good for young kids who are walking by their own. Passed by the third largest bay tree in California. Saw the farm animal at the end. On the way back saw 4 deers. Overall very suitable for our kids age group (2-7).< /Text><rate>4</rate><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Beautiful and extensive trails offering an open feeling with plenty of sunshine. Lots of trail options to appeal to a broad section of population. You can go rugged and do hills or opt to stay on flat paved walks. Plenty of miles. Very popular so parking on weekend mornings are nearly impossible past 9:3am.</review>

<review>Went to the park on a long weekend, it was very crowded but we managed to get a parking spot in a few mins (feels easy enough to get a spot anytime). I personally liked it much better than going to mission peak. Beautiful trails and lush green grass amid some tree line made it a nice and easy hike. Most of the trails are flat except a couple of them.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Many trails to hike and can do very easy hike to very long and steep. You can get to black mountain too from this trail and can choose a number of different trails to get to black mountain. Pretty good for easy family hiking too.</review>

Loved coming here for a hike with a friend and by toddler. Great retreat away from the busy lives of the silicon valley. Can't believe it is so close to the hustle and bustle of city life. I only walked on the east route but saw so many options for those who don't have a stroller. Restrooms were clean. Parking is hard to get but I got lucky on a weekday. Spotted 20+ deers so close to us. My toddler loved seeing the sheep and goats too.<//Text>

Rancho San Antonio is a preserve that combines both accessibility (it is right on the border of Los Altos/Los Altos Hills) and enough miles of trails to pack in a serious hike for the day. You could hike nearly 19 miles from the main parking lot up to Black Mountain and back, or you can exit the preserve at Hidden Villa and get ferried back from Moody Road to your car. The main area, within a mile of the parking lot and the Deer Hollow farm can feel crowded on weekends, but start hiking out a mile, and you'll start to find the solitude enjoyed by most serious hikers.<//text>

<text>Great place for a workout. I've been here multiple times. It can be very busy on weekends and after work. Good for a hiking workout and parts of it are good for running. There are shady spots, which is where I happen to see a few rattlesnakes, otherwise lots of areas of no shade and hot.

Great open space preserve, but not a lot of shade. Miles of trails and beautiful views while on your walk. There is ample free parking and bathrooms that are a little stinky.  There are water fountains to quench your thirst. I recommend you go early while it is cool.<//review>

There is something for everyone here and it is just one of the many reasons this is a much better place to go than Mission Peak or Communication Hill. It is outdoors in a scenic area and the trails are well maintained. Just don't go after it rains. The trails very in length such as moderate trails like Wildcat Loop or much harder ones such as the PG&E trail. Although if you do the PG&E trail on a clear day you can see San Francisco not to mention the abundance of wildlife from deer to snakes.< /text>

There are definitely more scenic hikes out there, but it's hard to expect too much when it's surrounded by South Bay suburban sprawl. Still, I really like hiking here, and if you're willing to take the time to go further into the hills, there are some trails where you feel like you really are getting away and out into nature. If you live nearby, check it out!<//Review><time>1442347987682<//time></record>

<user_name>Eric Gavaletz</user_name><Text>I was really surprised at how much wildlife I saw along the trail.  Humming birds, quail, rabbits, chipmunks, lizards, mice, cool blue birds, and the list goes on.  The trails are very well maintained if not a little too wide.  Plenty of room to stretch your legs, but not enough room to escape the rude groups of people who think the trail is the perfect place for loud conversations.  It also seems impossible to get away from the buzz of high tension power lines in this area.</Text></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>It is the closest open space to Sunnyvale. It has several vista points where you can see the bay area. There are many trails with different distances and difficulties.
You can hike all the way to the black mountain peak, which is 8 miles one way. You can also pick an short easy trail.
There are many runners running on the trails in the afternoon and evening. Trails are not that wide. Please always stay on right.<//Review>< pics>

Awesome nature here. It's not at all uncommon to see free range turkeys, deer, quail and of course lots of ground squirrels. And the farm is sure to be a great attraction for kids, with pigs, cows, ducks and chickens.
Besides the animals, the hike up towards the farm is admittedly kind of boring, lots of open space and not a lot of trees, it can be pretty brutal on the hottest days, but once you get into the forest it's quite pleasant.</Text>

<text>This is a nice place to hike with your family, friends, or by yourself. It's not very challenging;however, it has some steep climb at times. Remember to take the trail leading to the animal farm! Enjoy the breeze and the sound of water running along the creek, it's beautiful.< /text>< pics>

No winding roads to get here. Quick drive from Central San José. We arrived around 10 am on a Saturday and the couple of parking lots they have were full but people were coming and going so finding a spot was easy. The trails are very well maintained and mostly shaded. There were children on bikes, scooters, wagons, and strollers and many elderly people, so I would say the trails are fairly easy to hike, not a lot of elevation. My 3 year old hiked for almost 4 miles with no complaints. Perfect for beginner hikers. The farm, with chickens, goats, sheep, and pigs, was a plus.</Review>

I did the PG&E trail to reach the vista point and took the night medow trail back to the parking lot, which makes for a good 8 mile hike. I also saw some deer.</Text>< Time>

Beautiful and a wide variety of trails. Only downside is the limited parking; if you show up at the wrong time you will be stuck finding parking for half an hour or more.< /review>

< Review>
I've hiked every trail in this preserve and I will never get tired of them. The parking lot can get a little busy, but they're adding an extension to it so it'll be better very soon. Great place for running, hiking, bird watching, some horseback riding, and there's even a little farm! This is my go to place to take friends for a day hike anywhere from 2 to 16 mile loop trails.<//Review>

Unfortunately, it has become very busy on weekends recently and the parking situation is a joke. Arrive anytime between 8:30 and afternoon and you'll be searching for a spot.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>perfect place for easy hikes for kids, and advanced hikes for avid hikers. has a great farm too, the animals are so cute! I've been going there since I was 5, and I still love it. It's easy to navigate too, the signs are very clear. 10/10 would recommend<//text>< Pics>

Great place for hiking, views, running.  Visit the farm (with or without the kids).  Parking a challenge on weekends. You can hike all the way to the top of Black mountain (several hours each way).< /Text>

Beautiful open space with diverse wildlife (turkeys, deer, mountain lions, quails, bobcats, snakes, wild pigeons) variety of trails for short and longer hikes. And only few minutes drive from urban area. Probably the best open space preserve in the South Bay.</review>

This place is beautiful! My ex girlfriend used to take me here and we would go hiking, some of the best times of my life have been had here. It's kind of sad now to even see this place on maps... but one day I'll return.
Oh on a side note they need more biking areas.</Review>

Lots of trails, covered and open, ranging from easy to strenuous.  Also has a farm which is nice for the kids, but you have to hike to it (easy hike though!). Viewpoint on Upper High Meadow Trail is under an electrical tower and straight ahead view is restricted because of the overgrown brush but there is a bench and there is a nice view to the left and right.< /review>

<review>It's a great place for nature lovers who hike on the 24 miles of hiking trails, enjoy the views and visit the zoo. Local residents bring their children to walk and visit the zoo. The zoo has pigs, goats and 1 cow. You also see visiting deer, turkeys and other birds and animals.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Multiple options here.  Good easy kids walk/bike out to the farm to see the animals and gardens on pavement or trail.  Also good real hikes up in the hills above the farm.  Plus there's an RC airstrip next to the upper parking lot, which is fun to watch.</review></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful, gorgeous, peaceful. Totally great workout doing the full loop. Gorgeous SV views from the top. Watch out for mountain lions — be EXTRA cautious if jogging as mountain lions like that. Jog with a buddy (or five) and DONT wear headphones. Lots of animal viewing—turkeys, deer, birds. Farm is lovely and all the families with their kids is so wonderful to see<//Review>

No better place to run for hard core and casual runners. Beautiful trails, wildlife, easy trails, a monster uphill advanced hill run, intermediate runs, hiking, horseback riding, it's all here. My favorite place to run in the Bay Area (a frequent visitor from Pittsburgh).<//review>

<text>Great for the family. They have a farm house with sheep, goats, rabbits, a few cows, and chickens. There's even an open air barn for lunching. Otherwise, truly an open space that gets super hot. Make sure to check the lot down the hill for parking.</text><user>108663260148567670950< /user></record>

My family's best weekend hiking spot so far. Good views, mostly well shaded and family-friendly (there's an animal farm inside the park). There's plenty of trails to choose from, with differing lengths and difficulties. Huge (and free) parking lots and there are many amenities such as picnic areas, toilets, benches and drinking water.</Text>

<username>Mohammed Ishaq<//username><review>A great open space for hiking, which is very easily accessible.  Lots of easy hiking trails for the kids and the PG&E and black mountain trail for those looking for a good cardio workout. The petting zoo, picnic tables and the RC plane strip make this an ideal place for outing with the kids.< /review><Time>1520718844591</Time><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

It has everything one require in this month to unwind from daily office routine. Parking can get tough iver weekend so my suggestion is to take whatever you get instead of trying to get closer to gate. There are multiple parking lots and last one has restrooms too.< /text>< Pictures>

Love this place, I go for PG&E hiking trail from this place. This place has nice little farm, where kids can see cow, chicken, turkey, Horse.
The trails is beautiful, it has many paths. One, which goes around 1800 ft high has similar cardio as Mission peak. However this trail has shades and trees not like Mission peak. One path goes by stream, that is very beautiful.</text>

Nice park but can be very crowded and difficult to park.   There are lots of nice parks in Santa Clara County but this is one of the few with free parking and a Children's "Deer Hollow Farm."   It's heavily used by the local Cross Country teams for practice.    The model airplane flying field is one of the few places where it's legal to fly.</review>

Lots of well maintained trails, and eating areas. Noticeably free of garbage despite the large amount of children. Even when it's packed you don't feel crowded. Little petting zoo about a mile up the trail with goats and other small farm animals.  Great for trail runners, no major inclines<//Review>

Wonderful place to go for a walk, hike or run. Parking can be tough on weekends but otherwise such a wonderful getaway from the daily hustle. Often can see deer and other animals. There's a farm about a mile in.<//Review>

Great trails but car got broken into and stole many goods. I believe they were scoping us out. We were in the upper lot. Don't leave anything exposed.</text>

Great place in the South Bay for trail running or some hiking with friends and family. Come early on the weekends because the parking lots fill up pretty fast. There are quite a few trails to choose from and there's even a small petty farm.<//review>

It is an awesome county park with some real good trails. Plenty of parking and it's free. Weekends are a bit more crowded lately and you may need to wait for 10-15 mins for parking. If you have kids in your gang please make sure to visit the farm.</text>

A local treasure,  Rancho has a variety of trails many of which offer panoramic views of the surrounding area. Once past Deer Hollow Farm the crowds dissipate and even on busy days the trails are quiet. We often spot deer and wild turkeys, a variety of birds and once a bobcat. Parking is a challenge during peak times.<//text>

Rancho San Antonio is a true hiker’s paradise right in the center of the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley! It’s huge, just under 4,000 acres with 24 miles of hiking trails. The Open Space Preserve supplies a detailed map of all the trails, get a paper map at trail heads or PDF on website (paper map larger). You can hike an individual trail or combine a few to form loops of various lengths. Most trails are people-only, but there are some that allow bikes and horses (I avoid those – marked on map). There are 3 or 4 places where you can begin your hikes (parking can be a challenge on weekends, but weekdays are easy). I usually park at the end of Mora Drive, which gives you access to multiple trails. Trails vary in challenge. An easy beginner’s loop is the Rogue Valley trail, about 3 miles. If I want more of a challenge, the Chamise Trail is good, about 5 miles out and back and takes you through the Duveneck pasture, a quiet tranquil (400 foot elevation gain). The PG&E Trail is challenging, 4 miles with a 1,600 ft elevation gain. Wildcat Canyon is a good trail, shaded mostly, and brings you back to the Deer Hollow Farm where they keep some animals. Black Mountain is the most challenging, another 1,800 feet in elevation gain after you get to the end of the Chamise trail! Be in good hiking shape and take your time! Take lots of water with you on hot days! Don’t step on the lizards! (Western Swifts are everywhere).<//text>

I was on a business trip to the South Bay area (San Jose, Mountain View) for the week.  I wanted a hike and love elevation.  We took the 7 mile PG&E trail.  It was a good workout and gave a great view of the Bay.  There are several loops you can do if you aren't interested in the one I did.

I did it early in the morning and saw tons of bunnies as well as a few deer.</review>

Love coming here. It has something for everyone. For families, the trails are easy to run on, and on certain days there is a small farm with goats and other animals for the kids to see.

For the runners, there's enough paths where you can leave the crowd and go on to more challenging runs. They have nice vista points to reward yourself to getting the top. Parking can be tough but not impossible, it's ok to park up the hill. You're going to be walking anyways.< /text>

I'm sure it's been said a million times already, but they desperately need more parking. The one consistency of this place is that you can count on circling for parking unless you show up at some very odd hour.< /Review>

All kinds of trails that you can think of, easy to moderate to hard, both in terms of elevation and distance. If you're a trail lover, you'll find your favorite American trail right here. Being under half an hour's drive from anywhere in the South Bay, this is a haven for all the Silicon Valley folk. Love this, and will miss it sorely if and when I do leave NorCal.</Review>

also, if you want a quiet reflective hike.. the popular trails are littered with large groups of ppl talking loudly and or running as well.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmap_id></record>

< review>
When I lived in the Bay Area,  this was my favorite place to hike.   It is absolutely beautiful.   If you hike to the top of the hill,  you can see the whole Bay Area on a clear day.   However,  being a dog person.  I am disappointed that they don't allow dogs here anymore.   Perhaps too many folks let them off leash and craziness ensued?<//review>

What a contrast to the gridlocked concrete torture of Silicon Valley.
Only 20 minutes drive from there, u can quickly experience that  kind of arid, almost starched beauty that reflects this region well. The hike is quite easy, with a wide mostly paved pathways snaking around the hills. The views are spectacular of the mellow landscape. Shame about the obscene electric power lines... 1 star less for that.
Honestly after a dog-eat-dog binary-focused day trapped in the tentacles of whatever tech business u slave away for, this is like sinking smoothly into a lush golden bath of melodies that stroke ur soul.</Text>

Awesome park for running and hiking. Unlike other parks in the peninsula, this one allows non-millionaires to enter and enjoy the beauty of the views. Parking is really hard on the weekends so if you have time on the weekdays is the best time to go. Otherwise go very early</Text>

I enjoy hiking rancho San Antonio because of its mix of trails and the farm where you can see animals. My only criticisms of the park would be the first part of the walk is fairly boring and long to get to real trails and that parking is a pain. I feel like we find parking only 50% of the time but at least it is free.< /Text>

A hike where you can go any time of the day. We went on the wildcat loop trail and the path was very shady so we had a great time. The vista point offers a great view of the silicon valley< /review>

<review>Fantastic park near Mountain View. Follow the trail up for a great view of the southern part of the of the San Francisco Bay. Model airplane enthusiasts fly their planes on some days. Come early and see the wild turkeys and deer. I heard there are also mountain lions and bobcats, but only saw a bobcat in the far distance once years ago.< /review>< rating>

It is mostly shaded, covered by leaves, alongside small stream, not much of elevation. However the way between the parking lots and Deer Hollow Farm (1 mile) has almost no shadow and can be very hot during summer (and also crowdy).<//review>< pics>

Five stars only based on the memory I had of going to this place around 2007 - 2009. Now, yes, I do the favor of introducing people to the dizzying number of turns and intersections of this place before cutting them loose to visit on their own, but it is no longer the weekly weekend trek of the grueling PG&E trail or just to get outside for one of the quicker, easier loops. PARKING has become a stress-inducer. People have gotten ugly. I have witnessed a parking confrontation primarily due to the arrogance of one driver and nearly became involved in one myself had I arrived just seconds sooner. Throughout the years, the grounds and trails have been well maintained, though I attribute the wider trails to people not staying within the boundaries. Wildlife sightings are hit or miss, but I have seen a banded snake, a rattlesnake that was within striking distance but luckily too young to know that I was a potential threat, deer, turkey, hares, pheasants, ground squirrels, birds of flight that I'm too ignorant to identify, and my favorite: a California Newt. So, if you don't know any better, have never been, want to get outside, need to work in some cardio, like nature's creatures, then try the place out. You'll figure out when to go so actually can find a parking spot. And people of all ages are afoot on weekends, so it really is a place for a everyone - hence its popularity.<//Text>

I love hiking here, the trails are beautiful and well maintained.  However, the parking situation is awful, so few spots for the size of this park.  The wealthy neighborhood next door to the parking lot, where every house has at least a 2 car garage and a driveway, has recently instituted permit only street parking which makes the situation even more frustrating.  I pay my taxes that pave your road and ya'll have more than enough space to park your Teslas and BMWs.< /text>

<review>I very much enjoyed our hike, but parking was nearly impossible on the weekend.

Most of the walk is pretty flat and well-maintained, but there are some more challenging trails a bit further in. We ended up doing a 7ish mile loop.<//review>< Date>

Be sure to go in spring to see the baby animals! Goats, sheep, chickens, cows, a goat among the ducks, and the most beautiful rabbit I've ever seen!< /review>

Best place to get fresh air and enjoy greenery. Near to Santa Clara. Getting car parking is bit difficult on weekends. But there are many lots. If you wait for 5mins, you will get one.< /Review>

Good hike - many many different trails here with varying lengths / height variances! Signage was relatively good for a complex set of trails. The view could be slightly better (perhaps if I had tried a more difficult hike it wouldve been better)</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I was saddened by the end of our walk many years ago by the area you call the "farm". I am appalled by the breeding of the sows you have there and the cute little piglets that will have to be slaughtered for bacon on somebody's pizza. Please consider the humane route. It would be far better to save the ones who are downed en route to slaughter. Please stop raising pigs for meat! Thank you, N. Chiodo, (back to being an Oregonian).< /Text>< pics>

The trails here are well-maintained and not too difficult, so it's perfect for a relaxing hike for people of all ages. Many parts of the trails have plenty of tree cover, so don't be too worried about being sunburned. The park is super popular, so it may be difficult to find a parking spot.<//review>

Always too crowded, NO PARKING space. We had to park a mile away. I walked to the farm whit a 2 years old, anxious to see the animals and we were told that they had a found raising event and we had to pay $7/ea to get in!! REALLY!?
"How about posting a sign at the beginning of the trails going to the farm?"
That would have save me a little guy disappointment and the unfruitful walk....<//Text>

Nice light walk. The trail through the woods and hills is interesting, and it's refreshing when the view opens up.< /Review>

It's nice Trails but the nicer ones are just for walking and people don't know how to stay on their Trail and Rangers just sit in the car or on bike texting or on Facebook must be nice overall nice place but a little crowded at times to find parking</review>

This place feels like a whole other world compared to the cities close by! I love to go here on my days off to relax and get a good workout in. The trails here connect to other trails to get you all along the bay area!</text>

The park is very nice, great place to visit.  The directions on this page are incorrect.  There are signs at the Foothills Expressway that lead you to the park</text>

Great for a big park but they really need to address the parking issue knowing that so many people come there, it's common sense.</Review>

Easy access to the South Bay and Peninsula for some good nature time. At certain times of day it is crowded and loud and detracts from the beauty of the Area. Try to go when there are less people.</Review>

Wide variety of trails.  Great for kids because trails are mostly flat at first and you can walk/bike to a small farm where you can see goats,  sheep,  chickens,  bunnies,  pigs and a cow. Relatively shady.</Text>

If you can find parking, there's many trails and activities to choose from. The lower trails and loops are packed with families/strollers/bikers. BUT YOU CAN'T ENJOY ANYTHING IF YOU CAN'T FIND PARKING. I've turned around and left multiple times because of lack of parking and overall overcrowding. Maybe an entrance fee would help?<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A very nice place to enjoy with the family.
You can go have a picnic, you can ride a bike, you can walk or run.

There are various animals, and various paths to choose from.

They have several parking lots but they fill up so you will walk around until you find one.

They have toilets.

The place is clean.

What I recommend is to put more garbage cans in the canine since I found several bottles of water thrown away and those harm the animals and insects of the place.

But I recommend it 100%

(Original)
Un lugar muy bonito para disfrutar en familia.
Puedes ir hacer un picnic, puedes pasear en bicicleta, puedes caminar o correr.

Hay varios animales, y diversos caminos para elegir.

Tienen varios estacionamientos pero se llenan así que vas dar una vueltas hasta encontrar uno.

Tienen servicios higiénicos.

El lugar es limpio.

Lo que si recomiendo es poner mas tachos de basura en el canino ya que encontré varias  botellas de agua tiradas y esos dañan a los animales e insectos del lugar.

Pero lo recomiendo al 100%</review>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a good place to be with children. There is also a course where you can enjoy more than an hour of trail while you are pulling a stroller, and you can climb the mountain and see the Silicon Valley. There are deer farms in the middle, and there are many people who can see sheep and pigs. There is also a place where you can eat lunch in the middle, so it is a good place to take lunch and hike.
The parking lot is quite wide, but there are a lot of people, so when I arrived at 12 o'clock, it took about 10 minutes to park. At 2 o'clock there were more than 10 cars waiting. Please refer to parking time ~

아이들과 함께하기 좋은곳입니다. 유모차를 끌고도 한시간 이상의 트레일을 즐길수 있고 등산을 해서 실리콘밸리를 조망할수 있는 코스도 있숩니다. 중간에 사슴농장이 있는데 양과 돼지 소 등등을 볼수있어서 사람들이 많이 있슺니다. 중간중간 도시락을 먹을수 있는곳도 있어서 도시락을 챙겨서 하이킹 하기에도 좋은 곳입니다.
주차장은 꽤 넓지만 사람도 엄청 많아서12시에 갔을때 10분정도 주차가 걸렸고 2시에는 10대 넘는 차가 대기하고 있었습니다. 주차시에 참고 해주세요~<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4q9CsBHQG3tdRAL1mGaWqU3B7Vyk5rqLH5_A8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmfjK2s2fP3X8clOkQ5ocXw73LXlMCb_MkeXne=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuSQFcxBBe0YZU-sFrajAGvrE42lSxt4Xgn8tr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5y_nyvaVhUif_aucl7ZNXFT-dA_NvQZ9Z6exB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZxHPh9vSowBfU4ofxI9FeuXm3gSaLOowqxX2o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU068bWB-48BHJItri8-Hs66is_BmkcSKWVso-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7aSic36WzasRisRiPpi8hK13i3I6HSgq-zBZJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOegMvMwnYDC-QcmK2u_xMLEcxJOeJgWpfeP4GE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa2omHhqrCcY2VdsU9pVjYbFpsOBYm-YFLnaHW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdMmKnKIqSSJYZppK_M5tQU-JasL-xOlleflWp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJKrudLLTwF30hEJ9qO3EPHlBC8NQk4P19-zG2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0kvw28-L6z3GoQt9aKzzT5Hv8GkQtUmUYaYo-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh2wzJVleH9qkPMNkiY9IoMMpmSmaoTDoMbiJ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDcPqyYjoU8b746SvpZyUJ8XSLaFotRXoVs1tF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvdE_xJS3anfJRVOQShDVOZ0ieZN3U_oVfWOfr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm6_zLQTomNcuSJQsO_ZO3_2z-tuJ-GM3Xqnaj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNtsGkkYsdr4-vMdvOd3ghXoMfb_V761rZXcEJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJmV8gKbl5XUBGRaMaP2fZHs2wfnFUokKs44LZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2uOL6PRBCdU6nI2PdZ_72wxf4mD1O-Ms0HXwf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpFgTkhpxQkxLUYoRYqYD7Eve3YBCHLkqiZxwh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-K1HewmM7pBicojcgXKrMBncK47QASD0N0yNz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONqAZ5288wQQnpUU_AiLgM3VuamMVqXHIvHmaj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9ZF-Hr9hgaLoM_8F8AAKvyfz2Q7MW1lQNqRqI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl01bAjWOKvcGWiFjJr-ptPYFm_Wu6NNJUAq-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyyaMFf9QgICB3d67eqSzI8ePVi6JlJbq0Yqec=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to walk! Lovely livestocks in Deer Hollow Farm. Great scenery at a vista point.
A pleasant place to stroll and climb. When I visited in early May, I had plenty of parking space. There were quite a few people but it was very easy to walk. The scenery is beautiful, and you can see livestock such as sheep, goats, cattle, and chickens when you visit the farm. Be sure to visit Deer Hollow Farm. It takes 20 to 30 minutes from the entrance to the farm.
Wild turkeys are easy to see. I could see wild deer or rabbit, but I could not see it. If you climb the Vista point for 30 minutes on the farm, you can see the view from Mountain View to San Jose. There are many people who come to the stroller because the road is wide and flat. The vista point on the farm is not steep, but there is a little slope and a narrow section.

Beautiful place to walk! Lovely livestocks in Deer Hollow Farm. Great scenery at a  vista point.
산책하고 등산하기 쾌적한 장소. 5월 초에 방문했을 때는 주차할 곳이 넉넉했음. 사람이 꽤 있었지만 길이 넓은 편이라 걷기 편했음. 경치도 아름답고 농장에 방문하면 양, 염소, 소, 닭 같은 가축을 직접 볼 수 있음. Deer Hollow Farm은 꼭 방문하길. 농장까지는 입구에서 20~30분이면 도착.
야생 칠면조는 쉽게 볼 수 있음. 야생 사슴이나 토끼도 볼 수 있다고 하는데 보지는 못했음. 농장에서 30분 정도 등산하면 나오는 Vista point에 올라가면 마운틴뷰부터 산호세까지 전경을 볼 수 있어서 아름다움. 농장까지는 길이 넓고 평탄해서 유모차를 끌고 오는 사람도 많음. 농장에서 vista point는 길이 험하지는 않지만 경사가 조금은 있고 길이 좁은 구간이 있음.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKcRgkEV8HtBz7ZR9Hd0H3FNuomu9JTgiIwjg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) Great vacation spot with the whole family. Huge area. And almost in the city. You can get acquainted with wild animals and domestic animals. You can ride bicycles and even horses. We saw deer, heron, wild turkeys, a lot of earthen squirrels. Maybe not enough benches. Parking is problematic at the weekend.

(Original)
Прекрасное место отдыха всей семьёй. Огромная площадь. И практически в городе. Можно познакомиться и с дикими животными и с домашними. Можно кататься на велосипедах и даже лошадях. Видели оленей, цаплю, диких индюшек, много земляных белок. Может маловато скамеек. Парковка проблематична в выходные.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) There are ups and downs. Moreover, the course is diverse and it seems that you can enjoy trail running. However, as I went deeper into the mountains, the number of people decreased, and there was a mountain lion sign, which made me a little scared. There are bears in Japan as well, though.

(Original)
アップダウンあり。しかもコースが多岐に渡っており楽しんでトレラン出来そうです。ただ、山奥に進むと人も少なくなり、マウンテンライオンの標識もあり、少々怖くなりました。日本でも熊がいますし一緒ですけどね。<//text>
