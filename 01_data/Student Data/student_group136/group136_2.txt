Amazing little sushi restaurant, literally a hidden gem of Palo Alto since it's not on the street front but hidden behind in an alley.
Super fresh fish and the chef delicately dresses up every single piece of nigiri keeping the flavors in mind.
The uni was one of the freshest we've had in the bay area and some of the other stars included kanpachi, Shima aji, kin medai, sake to, Umi masu and of course the toro!<//review>

Even with the local closures of indoor dining, Daigo creates a great selection of take-out dishes, beer, and excellent sake beverages. Everything was super fresh and there is clear attention to details in their recipes and presentation. Thanks!

This place is tucked away in Palo Alto and had a really delicious omakaze! My boyfriend and I each got a set with a different nigiri at the end, his wagyu and mine uni. What we both really enjoyed was how meaty each slice of fish was. They certainly didn’t skimp on their portions of sashimi. And the Hamachi shots were a great way to start the meal too! Hopefully we’ll be able to make another trip out once it’s safe to soon.</review>

<review>Daigo had good sushi, great atmosphere, and great alcohol. All of the fish was fresh, and I enjoyed every roll. This place is more of the traditional idea of sushi. I would consider the rolls to be on the simpler side which lets the fish stand out, but that also means none of the rolls especially stood out. I would still visit if only to eat in the cute "hole-in-the-wall"-feeling restaurant.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Overall: super fresh, super tasty (can be expensive)

FOOD: omg, wow. So good . Every piece of nigiri was absolutely amazing. We had an assortment of fish and seriously, every single piece was delicious. My favorites were the toro, uni, salmon belly. But seriously all were great. I have to say that I was very impressed by how fresh everything was and the presentation of the food was still excellent.

LOCATION/SERVICE: a little hard to find lol. It's like in an alley and I only found it because of a sidewalk sign. The restaurant was clean and had great service. People there were very friendly and on top of it. We got our food quickly.

Would recommend if looking for delicious sushi and willing to pay</Text></record>

This place was great! My wife and I have been to a handful of sushi places in the area and this one hit the spot! The waitress was very helpful and attentive, and overall the service was fast and excellent. We ordered several rolls and enjoyed all of them. They have a good selection of options but without being overwhelming. The presentation, freshness, and taste were great, especially for a pretty reasonable price. We'll definitely be going back. The place is small but very well decorated and clean. It's a small hidden gem.< /Review>

Overpriced sushi, not worth the money or time. Came in 45 minutes before closing and was denied service on a perfectly fine and busy night. While there were plenty of tables that had still yet to order, we were forced to turn around and go back home without any hesitation or hospitality. I guess there's no such thing as southern hospitality around these parts in California.</review>< user_name>

The quality of their fish is really great.  I really like to start sushi with Miso soup (just a personal habit) and even that was really good.  Will definitely be back.</review>< Response>

<Text>High end sushi restaurant. Just four tables and a few seats at the bar. You are paying for quality fish. I recommend you let them choose for you. Drowning your sushi in soy sauce is frowned upon. The Zen of the sushi experience is in the restraint and simplicity along with the freshest ingredients.<//Text><userid>114708303105072162997< /userid>< Rating>

<text>Sushi was good. But the prices are steep. It's nice they have a patio are that you can sit and have a stroller. Service was quick and friendly. Sushi prices for what you get are overpriced and not worth it. It was nice to try but I left hungry and got a second meal afterwards lol< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

<Text>This is the best sushi I’ve had in the U.S.  I lived in Japan for 4 years and ate sushi/sashimi several times/week. 2 of us split the larger omakase, Erynga tempura, miso and edamame.  The omakase is better than any of the extremely expensive places in San Francisco at 1/3 the price.  The sushi is on par with the best I’ve had in Japan.  The ambiance is good; simple light colored wood, quiet, understated, like a solid place in Japan. Service was outstanding.  Our waiter was a young guy from Japan so the manners and customs were spot on.  It’s now our go to place for great sushi.  Skip the pretentious needlessly expensive places in San Francisco.

< Review>
We've been here multiple times, and watch time it's been consistently top-notch sushi.

The aburi saba roll (note there's ginger in it), eryngi tempura, and zuke sake toro are all you need to know. There's lots of other stuff here, but these are dishes I *assume* I'm ordering when I walk in the door.<//Review>

Top shelf sushi here. I'd recommend fish, but we mostly got the daily specials, which I'm not sure we'll ever see again. I'll have to go back to find out. Y'know, for science and stuff.

If you like umami, get the oyster mushroom tempura starter. Maybe even order two. We did.< /Review>

Their fish is really good and high quality. However they completely messed up the sushi rice. Seems more like Chinese rice, than the sushi rice cooked Japanese style. The rice takes  away from the sushi experience. If you just want to have Sashimi then it's probably OK.

Their Agedashi tofu was also sub par.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fbbd1e15a93ed:0xc6ba7f4f29ee3bb3< /gmapID></record>

<Review>Overall, highly recommended. Pros: best sushi and sake I've had in the Bay so far, very kind and knowledgeable waiters, intimate yet casual. Cons: quite expensive (paid $85/person for a 9-piece omakase, 3-piece sashimi, a shared roll and sake, all included), ambience/chopsticks/napkins/other details do not match the price tag, may need to wait for a while (we waited for 15 min at 8:15pm). Attire smart casual. Great for a date, OK for a first date. Similar quality to Kyosho, otherwise much better than other sushi restaurants in Palo Alto (e.g. Kanpai).</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><user_name>Stelios Serghiou< /user_name>< userid>

<text>Excited to see a SF place open up in PA. The lunch menu is limited to a few cooked and sashimi sets, plus some nigiri and maki. Service was friendly and fast.

I would save your lunch money ($26 for 8 PC sashimi lunch set) for a nicer omakase meal or to try a wider variety of their sushi and specialties (hamachi shot recommended!) only offered at dinner.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Finally authentic nigiri and sashimi in Palo Alto. Daigo replaces long time favorite and casual takeout spot Homma’s Brown Rice sushi with a more upscale and traditional sushiya experience.  Despite not being Japanese run, Daigo impresses with an extensive specials menu (rivals Gintei in San Bruno) and solid knife skills.  Nigiri are priced per piece which means prices can add quickly but that you can also sample a lot of variety.
Tip: order from the specials menu or choose among a variety of Omakase specials where the chef will choose.</text>

< Review>
Checked out this place on a quiet Sunday during their soft open. Second branch of a popular SF spot. Wait staff was lovely and attentive and the co-owner was so welcoming and friendly, recommending a perfectly clean tasting sake and making us feel as if we'd sat down to dinner at a friend's house (who just happens to make amazing sushi). Sashimi was delicious and fresh, flown in from Japan daily! They will add omakase and other specials eventually. Rolls were on point, good balance of filling v. rice, great flavor, and easy to fit in my mouth. Get the tamago too, it was just oozing with umami. We got comped a tasty green tea cheesecake for dessert! All in all a satisfying meal and I'm looking forward to making this my regular sushi spot.<//Review>

My Family and I have been coming here for years because they’re the best!
Amazing work, Lovely staff, the Dr herself is the sweetest lady in the world!.
They also have Great Pricing and honestly the best experience I’ve had going to the dentist...and that’s that going to the dentist is one of the least favorite things to do, according to people in general. We will continue coming with this dentist and will recommend them highly to anyone looking for a new dentist. 1000/10< /review>

Selfie Smiles Dental is the best. They are always friendly, kind, helpful, and conscientious. I have always been treated like family. Dr. Maritza is a very professional and thorough dentist. She makes sure to answer all my questions and great helpful details on options. She has a huge heart and is committed to excellence and truly offers a very caring patient experience. She takes great pride in offering the absolute best and professional service. I highly recommend her.</Text>

I would like to say that Dr. Lazcano and her staff are extremely professional, respectful and the services they offer are wonderful. Being able to sit and actually communicate with your doctor in respect to your dental needs is extremely important. They are open and honest and I trust them. In terms of treatment, the Dr has gentle hands and techniques so you barely feel any pain. I trust her.

Thank you so much for providing such great dental care.</Review>

Best Dentist in the VALLEY hands down! It’s hard nowadays finding a knowledgeable but most important, friendly dentist staff. You feel right at home with Selfie Smiles and I am incredibly happy and satisfied with the cleaning I got! Now I’m smiling even more confident and I am excited for my next visit! They officially have my business going into the future!!!</Text>

< Review>
I had two missing teeth and Dr Lazcano made me feel comfortable. She made multiple recommendations and gave me options. I love how she showed true caring for me. It felt personal. I had my first bridge done last month and I’m very happy with it. For my last space she is going to put two implants for me. I feel more confident about my smile and appearance now. Thank you Dr Lazcano and thank your wonderful staff for the great service.< /Review>

<Review>if I could I'd rate her zero, or even minus 5 stars
My wife and myself been getting treatment here. At first we where impressed with service here. But now its a horrible experience
Worst dentist ever !Dont waste your time and  money.. they just want your money and your time RUN..
I did a deep cleaning and whitening but nothing changed
and i didnt see any progress or any cleaning even for the whitening treatment
specialty frauds don’t trust her
those pic after deep cleaning you should shame on you< /Review><userid>116738399095870080001<//userid>< rate>

<review>Dr. Maritza was very quick to attend my fractured front tooth. I had an urgent matter and she quickly took me in. Her level of professionalism is very high. Extremely precise on the color, fit and adjusting.  If you need a great dentist she's the one. Also if you are afraid of a dentist she's nothing to worry about. I highly recommend her. Ella habla español y sus asistentes también y son de mucha clase y educación. Easy parking too.. Yo la recomiendo mucho a ustedes. L. B.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Dr. Han and his staff are so friendly and helpful.

They do professional, quality work.

The receptionist, Lela, is super friendly and so helpful making sure I get the write paperwork for my insurance claims.

They cater to my personal dental phobias always making me feel relaxed and comfortable no matter what the dental treatment is.<//Review>

I’ve never had ANY problems with them and they really take their time and dedicate themselves to their patients. I would really give them a try, I guarantee they will not disappoint. Thank you guys for everything!</Review>

<Review>Dr. Han is caring and knowledgeable. I am in my late 20s and was incredibly nervous about getting braces. He was very patient in explaining the differences as well as the pros and cons between traditional braces and clear aligners. As someone who tends to get anxious with dentists, I appreciate his calm demeanor. Overall, if you are looking for a dentist that is going to take the time to understand your concerns and advise you on what is best for you personally, Dr. Han is the dentist for you.</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Han is a great dentist.   Been going here for 12 years now.  His dental office is always emasculate. All the employees are wonderful.  Jose is my dental hygienist and he is always a pleasure to chat with during my cleanings.  My wife just started going here this past year and loves it as well.</review>

Dr Han, Lela, and Rosie are outstandingly professional. Dr Han is always equipped with the latest technology. After twenty years of dental services, I would still travel the world over to have Dr Han take care of my teeth.
I highly recommend Dr Han,  he is the best ever. AnnyTaylor<//review>

Dr. Han and his staff, are extremely helpful and friendly. Dr. Han stays current with the latest technologies. His office space is open and comfortable and he has managed the COVID 19 crisis  by spacing people’s appts and implementing safety guidelines.<//review>

I was little bit cautious because of Covid situation- but the whole office was so carefully managed to avoid any sort of virus transmission that I felt very safe and relaxed.

About the treatment, it was excellent as usual :)<//Review>

<Time>1290763226510<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Dr. Han and his staff are AMAZING! He has treated my children for years who have since overcome their fear of dentists thanks to Dr. Han! I saw Dr. Han for the first time in November 2010 because I thought I had a cavity. It has been more than 7 years since I have seen	a dentist because of a few traumatic experiences. Well Dr. Han told me I needed a root canal and a crown, or had to pull my tooth which he did not recommend. Instant panic struck me and I had to refrain from tears! Dr.Han was sooooooo patient and talked me through each option. He suggested we try the root canal without being put to sleep and without nitrous first to save me some money (who does that, really? Dr. Han!). I decided to trust him and we proceeded. I was amazed!! He gave me three shots and I did not feel a thing! He really took his time to make the procedure easier for me and it was completely painless!! I was in shock that almost two hours passed and I NEVER felt any discomfort or pain!! All I can say is that if you live anywhere in or near the Inland Empire and have ANY fear or reservations about the dentist you MUST check them out! BTW, when I looked for a place to post this remark I found stories from many patients of Dr. Han on various websites all singing his praises so I was not special but both he and his staff make me and my children feel we are everytime we visit his office!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I called to ask if they were able to do a design I had seen on IG. They had set me up for the morning after, super quick and easy. I did a gel mani on my natural nail, $35 for gel + $15 for the design. Andy was great, he had to modify a little because my nails were a tad shorter than the ones on the photo, so he worked through it. He was also helping a girl with an emergency broken nail at the same time, he’s a real trooper. He kept asking if I was ok with how it was coming out, which was really nice. There wasn’t that rude tipping pressure you find at many salons, he did a really nice job so I had no problem at all tipping him what he deserved.
The place was clean and masks were used. There was a plexiglass between us, although he wasn’t wearing gloves when he was touching my hands but I personally didn’t mind.
Definitely coming back for more!</text><Date>1621582895793<//Date>< gmap_id>

Update: I went back for a fill and my nails turned out amazing again. I requested Tracy. I have found my nail tech! Yay! I got coffin shape and a midnight purple shade. Shiny this time. Beautiful. Love Diamond Nails and Tracy!

My nails turned out beautiful. I was worried because I needed a set last minute and couldn't get into where I usually go. I am pretty picky about the nail shape and length etc and so I was nervous.
Tracy welcomed me right away and let me know she could do the complicated design I wanted no problem. Her confidence put me at a bit more ease.
After thinking about it for a minute I decided I wanted plain matte black stilettos instead. Looking back I know she would've done a great job at whatever I chose.
Tracy told me that she's been doing nails done over 20 years. Its what she does (this was what she said when asked if she likes doing nails as I have done nails in the past as well), and she's great at it!
The way she shapes the nail is so impressive. She actually takes the time to make sure they're even, not too wide, not to high off the nail bed etc. Plus she's good enough that she can be time efficient while also delivering a quality service. I can't say enough good things about her and the establishment itself. I will definitely be back.
Thank you Diamond Nails for helping to make my graduation special. 🖤<//text>

Hate to be that person, but this nail salon was pretty bad. They didn’t have the color I wanted, so the woman gave me another color... saying that it was the same one. Ended up being hot pink and not at all what I wanted. I got dip powdered nails done, so there were some steps that needed to be done for everything to dry correctly, and she forgot about them... so my nails never dried and I left the place with worse nails then I came in with. I ended up fixing them at home. The service was bad as well. Never never again.</text>

Pretty typical cheap asian nail salon. You get what you pay for! I do think they make an effort at having good health standards since they put a plastic bag around the tub for my pedicure but that's not exactly an eco-conscious choice and I didn't notice procedures in place to make sure other instruments and tools of the trade were clean and/or safe. Also, my pedicure chipped within a day of application.</review>

<review>If you want to spend $22 for a 15 minute spa pedicure then this is your place. I’ve never had such a terrible spa pedicure in my life. 15 minutes from the moment my feet touched the water...felt like he was going to cut me as he was so rushed. When I asked him if that’s really it for $22, he said yes and walked away. I was the first customer in this morning so it’s not like they had a reason to rush.

<review>I've been to Hollywood as a tourist and had an accident with my nails. Just went in to Diamond's to have a quick manicure. Had to wait for like 15 minutes. They did it quick, clean and lovely. It's USD 17 for a quick manicure which is very reasonable. Will come back one day and have the pedicure as well!

Not happy.. Did my nails and toes.. I asked the nail technician if my toes were insta dry and she said yes. I still waited a while but as soon as I got home I noticed a large smudge on my big toe and it ruined my pedicure. I don't think she understood me but just said ya anyway. They were nice and hate to write a bad review but what's the point of getting a pedicure and paying all that money and then have to go home and redo my toes. 😏 and now my nails are already chipping with gel manicure. Didn't even last a week.</Review>

I have been coming to this salon for almost 8 years. I not be returning. Diamond Nails has lost a loyal customer !!
The technician charged me for a manicure and lied about performing it. She didn’t clean my fingers cuticles. It’s wsd never performed!

She reshaped the nails twice but not a manicure.
I will never return to this salon. I have no reason to lie considering that I’ve been coming for many many years!!
While I like her personality she has rushed my services and also become complacent with me since I always coming. She has become rude and taken my business granted! Today was the last straw.
Furthermore the shape of nails are not even and she did a poor job on the gel application!
I will be filing a report with the Better Business Bureau as well.
I paid for the bill so I could leave. Diamond Nails has permanently lost a a loyal customer! After 8 years! Not right !< /Text>

I had a great experience here.  I have not treated myself to a mani and pedi for a few years now, and it was long over due.  I had two gentlemen work on me and wow.  I had a gel French manicure done and it looks beautiful.  The pedi looks great as well.  (And I'm sure it was challenging for them!) They were efficient, kind and great at what they do.  I live up the street and will definitely return.  Great price. Thanks a bunch!!< /text>

< Review>
I contracted a toe infection after getting a pedicure here. I approached them a day or so later and they refused to refund me, they told me I needed to go to the doctors and they would pay for the medical bills and give me a free pedicure. I do not understand why they would rather pay upwards of a 100 dollars than just refund me..? AND why in the world would I go back to a place that gave me an infection..? They were rude, I didn't feel any form of remorse from them and this is needless to say but, please just DO NOT GO HERE.< /Review>

<Review>Disappointed abt this store saw amazing reviews abt it and saw it closes at 8. After we went to universal at 6:45 we pull up and I run it to be told In Spanish it’s closed. I said I didn’t understand twice and worker was a bit rude trying to keep me away. How abt y’all first say 6:30 on sundays or something bc it said 8 pm close. Saw amazing jerseys in there and would of paid for them but rude worker</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

You would never know about this place unless you were part of the soccer Community I'm downtown LA. Incredibly warm and helpful staff, everything you need to equip a soccer team, all of the cold spray, bomb, bandages you need to keep players on the field and everything you need to outfit a team.

The cheapest screen repair for my I-Phone XS Max was in my Purse and it broke while in my purse phone turned green and blue on screen had a temper glass on as well! Took into a store this guy not even 24 hours after walking out, said I’m that wouldn’t happen I must have dropped it, Technically call me a liar Extremely disappointed very cheap screen he said I can help y’all just discounted $50 when I paid $149 nope! Don’t waist you’re time or  money, take it to the Apple Store!</text>

Prompt professional service keeps a steady stream of customers here and when you talk to him you can tell this is what he loves to do. Repairs and trouble shoots mobile device problems. There's always cell phones and tablets taken apart when I come to see him. My friend, who has a walnut farm, dropped his cell phone in a bucket of oil and Mohammed helped him clean and restore it. He was amazed and incredibly happy with his service and prices. Mohammad also has a close friend who works on computers, so any problem that comes up can be resolved. I hope you'll have time to drop by and meet him and get his help, it's always a great experience!< /Review>< Date>

He even put on a free screen protector. Sweet, down to earth, professional repair tech, this is your guy! Highly recommend!</Review>< userid>

The owner Muhammad always goes above and beyond. He’s very friendly, honest and incredibly helpful. If he can’t fix it, he finds someone that can. Also, better prices than anywhere else in town. Thank you!!</review>

<Review>Mohammed was very honest and sweet to my friend Carolynn. He had no idea I'm a Google Guide. When he was done diagnosing her broken phone he made an HONEST & fair assessment. Gave her good advice on how to find an inexpensive phone ( she's elderly and on a seriously limited budget.) He was a true professional! Love to support local businesses who treat customers RIGHT!
Go see him - tell him Kathy sent you! 😊
If you've got a 'broken phone' you definitely NEED to see what he says FIRST!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I went in beyond stressed out because I needed photos off of the phone. My phone kept restarting it never came to the home screen. He was able to fix it, pull a dent out of the phone, put on the glass over lay, and got me a case for my phone. I never had to leave my phone over night. He was able to work with me and told me step by step everything thing he was going to do, and also the other way to solve it if plan A didn't work. This place is beyond amazing and does great service for a great price!!! 😄< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I was not going to be able to pick up the phone for a few days so he delivered it to my work without me even asking. When he returned it was I very pleasantly surprised. The phone would charge now, he returned it at 100%, he gave an apple charger cord and box, and he fixed the cracks on the screen (which did not ask him to do) and all for a very reasonable price. Good customer service and they definitely know what they are doing. I will definitely take in my family members phones again and recommend them to my friends.<//review>< Pictures>

We had our Samsung galaxy s6 repaired for broken front and back glass and the repairs were done quickly and efficiently. The price was very reasonable and actually cheaper than the surrounding shops.   Thanks for the great service.<//Text>

Best experience ever! He had to order the piece for my phone, so it would take a bit longer. Originally it was supposed to come in on the 24th and it came on the 20th ! He said it would take an hour but it got done in less than that! Highly recommend this place!</Review>

Great service  - I had quotes from other phone repair shops in Turlock for a small fortune to fix my Samsung Galaxy S7, but Mohammed suggested another solution which was much cheaper and works perfectly. Would certainly recommend.<//text>

<text>Just went for restaurant week dinner.
Brussels sprouts and mushroom flat bread absolutely fabulous. We were early so had happy hour prices for drinks and they were great. The fried chicken was cold. I would expect fresh cooked food. I can get leftovers at my house. The waitresses tried to steer me away from the chicken, very subtlety but it sounded so good. Chicken cooked in duck fat. They reheated it for me. Loved the place and peeps. Feel cheated on the food.
But we also had dessert. Cheesecake, dry and tasteless. Pot o cream was great.
Next time it'll be drinks and appetizers only.<//text>< Name>

<Text>Beer selection is top notch. Gourmet Burgers and the Brussels Sprouts are a must. They serve Pliney at that magical time of year which couldn't make beer lovers more happy.... Also the duck fat fries and home made ketchup. Get all that and you will be in a glorious state of mind.< /Text><time>1487527520137< /time>< UserId.>

We've been back twice now and every time it's been wonderful. They regularly have the coveted Russian River Pliny the Elder IPA on tap for $8.50. Happy hour features a few $5 draft beers and wines, as well as some nice food options. The shishito peppers are good (not battered as expected but still great) and the truffle fries were excellent. You get a heaping mound of them for like $5, awesome deal.<//Text>

One of the best burgers I've had. Love the interior to this place, my kind of joint. It's a little tiny and can fill up easily, but the food here is excellent and if you're are ever in the area it's definitely a good choice. Appetizers are also really tasty but I feel like the burgers are their specialty.</text>

I have been out to this location twice. The first time, a reasonably busy Friday night, I sat at the bar by myself like I frequently do, and had a nice experience. The bar staff was attentive, the daily tacos were excellent, and I left with the idea cemented into my head that I would be back again. The second experience nearly ruined it for me. The bar tender that night was completely oblivious, entirely submerged in a nearly hour long conversation with a couple just three seats down from me, and failed to even ask me if I would like another drink when mine was empty; another one of the bar staff picked up the slack for him. He then proceeded to brag to this couple that he was the "best bar tender in Orange County", a claim that I, to be kind, scoffed at. I believe his name was Paul. I will probably be back to this location, simply due to the quality of food and draft beer selection so close to my temporary home, but I doubt I'll ever forget the impeccable lack of service I received that evening.</Text>

<Review>We came without rezzies on a Thursday night and there were seats, but we cut it close because it got pretty packed soon after.

We shared the black label burger, crow burger and duck fat fries. The burger portions were a bit small but they're artisan, we get it. The taste alone made the world go round again. They were both delicious. The famous duck fat fries aren't amazing, but they paired well with the burgers.

They need bigger water glasses with less ice because the glasses are tiny and the ice impedes you from actually drinking. More attention to refills, please.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dce08b273d8651:0x751c2667c069b771<//gmapID></record>

Great beer and cocktails. New food menu is a bit limited but don't be fooled by the "starters" - the ones we had were actually huge platters for sharing. We had the tater tots, sprouts and sausage trio between 2 of us as the whole meal and had to take the extra to go which formed the basis of our lunch the next day.<//review>

The "Black Label" burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was so delicious that I ate it plain. Just the meat and bun and nothing else. They grind up a ribeye steak and make that the burger along with bone marrow butter. Pricy at $19 but worth it. I enjoyed excellent service from Kacie as well.<//Review>

Small bar/restaurant that is always full and fun. Burgers are some of the best around. Duck fat fries featuring a giant beer and wine list are the reasons to go.< /review>

This seems to be a very popular local spot, but my one experience was "meh". Service was not so great and it was too noisy for any sort of conversation. Food was good, though.< /Review>

Can't say how disappointed I was in the service and the food we received on the night of 3/25/2017.

Upon entering the restaurant, my wife and I were the first out of a party of 4 to get there. We stood around waiting for someone to seat us and was rather annoyed that out of the 3 servers and the one bartender, we were being unnoticed. I eventually had to walk up to a server and ask if anyone was going to seat us. Mind you, the establishment was not overly busy at the time. Strike one.

A few minutes later, our other two guests arrived.  Our server gave us some waters and had us look over the menu. One of our guests asks the server if she could sample a beer. It was super awkward when the sever questioned the sampling of a beer. There was a moment of pause and a bewildered look to the servers face.  It couldn't be more obvious that the server was shocked that someone wanted a sample of a beer.  I wanted a lighter beer and a Pacifico sounded good. The server came back and told me that they were out of Pacifico. Who runs out of Pacifico?  Really?  Strike two.

Upon ordering our dinner, the server fesses up that it's her second day on the job and that this restaurant is different than her last. Okay, I get it, I understand. I've worked in a restaurant before and I know how hectic it can be.  This note is for the manager there, if there is one. If you have a new server who doesn't seem like they know what they are doing, perhaps it would behoove you to have your other employees help them out. It would make your patron's experience much better, and perhaps would make your employees much happier in the long run.  So we order our food and my wife decides on the short rib. The server then asks how does she want it cooked?  Is that a trick question?  No, she was serious.  We finally get our food and everyone's dinner looks okay with the exception of my wife's short rib. It came out grey, super dry, and lacking of all flavor. We send it back and order their grilled cheese. Literally it takes them almost 20 minutes to make it and they forgot the bacon. Whatever at this point. Strike three.

Lastly, please ensure the restrooms have an adequate supply of paper towels.

Go at your own risk.< /Text>

Duck Fat Fried Chicken and Waffles ($17) is served with maple butter and crow hot sauce. The exterior is golden brown and crispy. The duck fat flavor is definitely apparent and adds a richness to the chicken. The chicken is tender and juicy. The waffle is pretty good, but adding the maple butter and syrup makes it a winner. The hot sauce gives it a spicy kick to get you going on a Sunday morning. Rating: 4.8/5

The Crow "Black Label" Burger ($19) is an 8 oz. signature blend beef patty (including 21 day dry aged prime ribeye) served on a brioche bun with bone marrow butter, and caramelized onions. The burger patty is juicy and meaty. The bone marrow butter adds a creamy richness to the burger and caramelized onions add sweetness. The brioche bun is soft yet sturdy and holds the juices in the burger. Add a side of duck fat fries. The fries have a crispy exterior and kettle chip flavor with a soft, fluffy interior. Rating: 4.8/5

"Smores" ($10) is a graham cracker cake topped with milk chocolate and toasted marshmallow ice cream. The cake has a solid texture, almost like cornbread. It has an in-your-face graham cracker flavor. The marshmallow ice cream is creamy, fluffy, and tastes like ice cold marshmallow crème. Hershey's chocolate mini bars are at room temperature so it is slightly soft for a melt-in-your-mouth s'mores experience. All that is missing is a little bit of burned sugar! Rating: 3.5/5</Text>

After booking online, I arrived at my appointment and while the front desk lady was direct and answered my questions, she so took it upon herself to shame me for touching my own piercing. Mind you, these are piercings I have had for over 2 decades and was touching the jewelry but that apparently is a massive sin in this shop. The piercer was extraordinary, but she spoke over me when I asked questions and was only genuinely nice after I tipped her. Not sure what type of bug crawled up and into these ladies, but this shop would have 10 stars if they weren't so rude/cold. If you don't mind some snappy attitudes, this is by far one of the best technical places I've ever visited. They are APP certified and have beautiful jewelry. They also accommodated my request for the location of my piercing to change at the last minute. I would definitely recommend but also warn people of the impending 'tude...< /review>

I waited to see how it would heal before writing a review, and I must say that I'm very disappointed with the result of my nose piercing. I waited an entire year to change to a hoop, but as can be seen, the piercing was done crooked, leading to the hoop not sitting properly and being angled towards the front. What isn't as visible is the fact that the piercing hole was also angled downwards instead of going straight through. I could understand if I got this done in some back alley, but I payed pretty decent money for this to be done at Enigma. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because both Rubi and Evan are phenomenal people and great piercers. Not so sure about the person who did my nose piercing, though.< /review>

<Review>I like the quality jewelry here but the staff are very rude. when I made an appointment and came in to pick out some jewelry, the woman in the front was very standoffish and rude. I felt completely unwelcomed and I do not plan on coming back. It appears I’m not the only one since I read another review that stated the same thing. It’s unacceptable to treat customers so badly.</Review>< pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><review>very expensive but an amazing place all around. great sterilization process and very nice people. my piercer was Erika and she's very understanding and let's you take your time and set your own pace. just be prepared to spend around 100-150 even for a simple pair of ear piercings. definitely expensive but not overpriced. they have top of the line mirror finish jewellery and a wide selection. I'd definitely recommend to anyone who can afford it.<//review>< pictures>

Took my 11 year old daughter here to ear piercing. It was so easy and virtually pain free. The piercer has years of experience, was kind, gentle and walked us through every step. No reason to ever do the old gun piercing method. My daughter's earrings are symmetrical and sit beautifully on her ears. No issues healing whatsoever. Nice assortment of studs too.< /Review>

I had a really good experience here getting jewelry swapped out. The piercer was friendly and provided some helpful tips for caring for my piercing which was healing from an infection.  I haven't bought jewelry here as it's rather expensive but it looks to be high quality and they have a ton of interesting pieces.</review>

Where to start? Before choosing a business for my first piercing, I did plenty of research. Enigma was easily the most impressive on paper and is, as far as I can tell, the only APP certified business in San Diego.

After going to Enigma for all four of my piercings and jewelry changes, I can definitely say they live up to their reputation. The staff are all extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and (above all) patient. I had a few brain farts at my most recent visit with Rubi, but she was incredibly accommodating and took the time to walk me through the process. Shout-outs to Evan, Lou, and the front-end staff for stellar service too!

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Enigma was impressively thorough with their safety and sanitation procedures; their response to our new reality has been solid and extensively planned. They have a wild selection of beautiful, high-quality, and safe jewelry too.

Looking forward to my next visit, whenever that may be!</Text>

Their name says it all! Everyone on the Enigma team is next level professional, as well as incredibly skilled and kind. Not only did I have an amazing experience last year getting my double nostrils done,  but then Shane and Lou *really* came through for me today when I was having a fairly challenging jewelry emergency. They seriously went above and beyond anything I have ever experienced in the industry. I already tell everyone I know who's considering a new body mod to go to Enigma, and I will definitely not stop doing so.
Thanks again you guys! True lifesavers< /review>

<review>I went in to replace a rook ear piercing. The shop was very clean and very organized. I first thought that signing a huge release just to buy jewelry was a bit much but thinking about it, the organization skill of keeping track, I would MUCH rather have a company be on top of sht!! Plus I wasn’t thinking about it at the time that a piercer would be putting In the new earring piece. So I’m glad they are thorough!
I signed the release and answered all my questions. Both piercers there were very informative and helpful as to why my current ear piece may have been bothering me. The ladies behind the counter were also very nice.
The gentleman who changed out my ear piece was Didier. Very very cool guy! Helpful, informative, funny  and made me feel at ease,  Thank you Didier! But they were all great and I was very very pleased to see that they were strict about keeping clean, and wearing their masks PROPERLY! ...as I am trying to be just as careful so I felt comfortable in their environment!</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d955bb232f0141:0x30953a767f096e07< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I didn’t even get to make it into this shop. I had read reviews and saw they did great work, so I had called to ask if they did a certain kind of piercing. Instead of saying yes or no, the woman who answered the phone just hung up on me.< /review>< pics>

I appreciate Enigma's high standard of professionalism in their service. I went there years ago to have my nose pierced the first time. Since then, I tried a few other places for piercings because the prices were low. Unfortunately, so were the services and quality. So when I went for my latest piercing I wanted to make sure the work and the jewelry were the best quality. I knew I couldn't go wrong with Enigma. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I think they could use one more person behind the register. When I went to change my jewelry out last time, there was a long wait. I think it would be helpful to have one additional employee when the shop gets busy.</Review>

I just moved to San Diego and needed a new piercer. I was referred to Enigma and Evan by a close friend because she is diligent about good piercers and shops. I went to the one on Adams Street. I was not disappointed. They have a good selection of quality jewelry and can custom order what they do not have in stock. They have a sanitation machine and even show you the result of your jewelry sanitation before doing the piercing. Evan was very professional, communicated every step he was doing before he did it and was great at helping with deciding on jewelry placement (which is helpful when your ears already have 15 piercings already and plan for more). I highly recommend him and this shop.< /Review>

Just be aware it can get very busy on the weekends.</review>

Got my verticle labret done here recently. Short wait time, helpful staff, and they're always very clean & professional. I didn't bring someone with me this time for a second opinion, but my piercer Evan took the time with me to make sure I felt good with the placement. I have come here for all my piercings, except my ears. And I will continue to come here. They also have good quality jewelry to choose from. Well worth the drive for me.</text>

<review>Total Pros! My daughter has had many piercings, and when she visited and I decided I was ready to both get some old ear piercings opened up and have a nasal piercing, she insisted I go to Enigma because its piercers are the only ones in San Diego listed with the Association of Professional Piercers. They did not disappoint. I had my work done in Pacific Beach, and when one of her earrings came off (and, later, after one of mine did), she (then I) went to the Normal Heights location. ONLY place to go!<//review><Date>1564264719398</Date><Name>Tamara Jessup (Tam)<//Name><Pics>None< /Pics><gmapID>0x80d955bb232f0141:0x30953a767f096e07< /gmapID></record>

<text>I brought my 5 year old daughter here to get her ears pierced. I am a medical professional and work in the ER. They had fantastic sterile technique and hygiene practices. Also, the piercer used every tactic I've ever been taught for doing procedures with kids. These guys are truly professionals.< /text>< Pictures>

Excellent place to get pierced. They are very knowledgeable and professional. I just wish they weren't so strict about the type of jewelry they will put in for me. But I understand why, though (they don't want to be liable for bad reactions to lower quality jewelry).<//text>

{'time': 1583009715800, 'text': 'Hi Mairene, thanks so much for your feedback. Both of our studios have a 7:30 cutoff for services. Our employees work hard and work all day, and we are very thorough about end of the night cleaning. We’re so sorry we didn’t get to take care of you, both of are locations are consistently busy, so we encourage our employees to stick to a certain schedule and timeframe. The stations get broken down, all items from the day get processed. We work a bit differently than most studios, for example we sterilize items in the autoclave in front of you, which takes a bit of time, and is factored in to our 7:30 cutoff. Once again, thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review and we apologize for not being able to take care of you, have a great day!'}<//response>

I have been going to Evan ever since 2011 when he worked at Church of Steel down town.  I have not always been regular about coming to him for jewellery but every time I have been back, he has been excellent.  He is very sweet and takes his time to make sure the jewelry fits the way it should. I have brought a friend in to Evan before to get her nose and tragus pierced and she was very happy and it looked great and healed beautifully.  I have not had any new piercings in about 7 years, but when I do get more he will be the only one I will go to.
I went in today to get a peice of jewelry  that had broken replaced and to get a proper size for a bar backing for one of my ear piercings.  It had been 7 months since I had had some other guy pierecer at Enigma put them in for me.... he had not done a good job I regret to say... but I do not remember his name. Evan was so nice and even though I had waited way too long to get it fixed by Enigma for free... he gave the bar to me free of charge anyways.  I am very grateful and recommend to all who go to Enigma to see Evan.  I garnetee you will have an excellent experience with him. Thank you Evan! I appreciate you.</text>

<Text>They will always be my number one pizza order. Vegetables fresh, crunchy. Condiments, plentiful. Crust is fluffy and perfect. Dont be afraid to order the thicc crust. The cheesy pesto bread is definitely a plus to the pizza order. The staff has always been phenomenal, whether it be pick up or delivery. Having this pizzeria in the neighborhood is a God send.</Text>< response>

This place, and team of people ROCK!  I just relocated from Atlanta, and was seeking some great local pizza!  I came across their unique menu, and thought "yep, I want to try that!" I did the half and half Speciality pizza and tried their Hawaiian and Burger pizza, and they are delicious!  Not only that, but 1. The gentlemen was kind enough to help me carry my order to my car, as I had a toddler in tow and 2.  Our order took a little longer than estimated, but they kindly let us sample the cheese sticks, and my son loved them!  Delicious and unique menu, excellent customer service, great place to do business with!  Thank you!<//text>

Pizza was good but 37 dollars for one large half combo half pepperoni lovers (which I though would be a lot of pepperoni, it was not even the normal amount) and a small basic pepperoni (which had little pepperoni) I could get that a
at Costco for three huge pizzas<//review>

< review>
Got a x-large 3 topping meat pizza and mozzarella sticks. The price with a coupon was pretty good although the person on the phone didn’t apply it and I called back to get it updated. The crust or bread was not that great. The pizza sauce was a sweet sauce and although it wasn’t my favorite, it was pretty tasty. The other ingredients were pretty good as well. The mozzarella sticks were really good and that’s what I liked the best. Unfortunately I will have to try a different pizza place next time but may come but for the sticks.</review>

I thought I ordered something, but technology was against me. Got frustrated because my order was wrong on delivery, call in frustration. They called me back and apologized. It was no ones fault. The customer service stood out to me. Amazing pizza and staff. Sorry for my frustration</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Friendly people and great pizza! Great and stellar customer service and they gave me free donuts and free cheese sticks the last few times I ordered delivery to my door using Grubhub! This pizza joint is awesome! Love them!

They have the best pizza ever! I have ordered 3 times from here using Grubhub and these awesome people have been on time every single time! They offer free delivery and are very close to my house. Their pizza is great and yummy and the employees and owners are so kind! The first time I ordered, I had a small order and they called me to ask if they could deliver it earlier. Awesome customer service and I appreciated that! My second delivery was a huge order and they gave me a box of FREE donuts with a sweet note written on top of the takeout box. The Apple fritter donut was bomb! Loved it! So sweet of them and yesterday I ordered a large pizza from them and had it delivered for the third time and they were so sweet she kind again to make my day and gave me a FREE medium sized box of garlic cheese sticks! Score! Love these people here abs I highly recommend eating here and doing business with them. They know how to treat the customers right and their delivery has always been on time with stellar customer service! You can really tell how much they appreciate your business and how much they care for their customers. I definitely recommend! Thanks guys!<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9roHdMkScWZaqIQzgZKgizP6YSBTzcpVN4kTu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnRUXDimIg7vnmxyfmvmCOHSLND8F8Bq1WD62x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH4e1i4E8qwgCi45cjM1iu2i-TmZSUrZg4eRE5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJdcm98_KoFW0gPMDVgX8bl0VUe8_NLkv8blGV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWUXl_BhbMT-on_5CFtmTJobzba18BwpBXOzfj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

This place has the best pizza around, hands down! Our food is always hot, fresh & Milan is a great example of how every business should treat their customers; they're personal, remember customers by their order & take care of us like we're old friends. I only hope for continued success for this business & the owners who lead by example & create an excellent product.<//Text>

We love this place. Awesome owner, killer classic pizzas and incredible unique specialty pizzas. Shes always coming up with new ideas. Every store should use Mulan Pizza as an example of how customer service SHOULD be. This is a real hand made pizza.  I would give 101 stars if I could.< /Text>

<Review>The best Keto pizza I have found in Sacramento!

The pizzas were delicious and so were the wings! The sausage is cooked on the pizza not precooked and they make their own ranch. Two qualities that really stand out to me about a good pizza spot and this place does both. I will be going back! Thanks Karen!<//Review>< name>

If you have a gluten allergy and a dairy allergy then you know how hard it can be to find pizza places that have good tasting dairy free pizza and cater to the allergy. THIS IS THAT PLACE. Milan has the best gluten free and dairy free pizza around. I have searched and tried many different places in Sacramento. Milan is the best. The people there are super friendly! You got to at least try this place once. Its mind blowing. You wont want any other place. They also have amazing regular pizza. The sauce is fantastic!!<//Text>

<text>Fantastic customer service and great deals. We were really looking forward to trying this place out. Unfortunately, the pizza didn't stand out the was the people did. Crust was dry, chewy and flavorless, and the chicken wings tasted less than mediocre- no real seasoning and very generic. Overall, very unimpressive compared to other pizza joints. I probably won't be back.</text>< Pics>

<review>order my pizza at 8:40(an hour and 20 minutes before closing), 9:35 i called once  to verify my order and i was told that they were waiting on the wings, 10:10 i called once again and asked what the status was and was informed that my order was never being made at all. i understand if someone forgot but the fact that they lied to me was not ok. this is the first 1 star rating ive ever given. disappointed.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Outstanding Service! First time guest, and they were busy, taking orders over the phone and helping other guests, yet they treated me like i was someone they knew for years. Honestly can say that I will come back any time I have a craving for Pizza, simply because they treat people right.</Review>

Great pizza, and amazing mozzarella sticks! Probably my favorite pizza place in the area, the staff is always friendly and the delivery never takes more than 45 minutes. All of the pizzas I have tried have been delicious, and the pasta is good too, but I would be lying if I didn't admit that the reason I keep coming back is because of the mozzarella sticks!<//Text>

At this point I'm concerned about the Inconsistency.
2 weeks ago when I got a pizza there it was absolutely perfect. The the base was delicious and perfectly done. The toppings were excellent.
Today I ordered the very same pizza and the toppings were excellent, But the base Was not good. It was gummy and not quite cooked or something.
I was planning to buy pizza from Milan for a family gathering that's coming up. Now I don't know if I will or not.< /review>

<Text>Milan Pizza I was one of their very first customers when they open thedoors they always have specials this is a family-owned business and I'm telling you they do take care of their CUSTOMERS.
They also deliver and they have sodas and they bring plates and peppers and cheese if you want a good down-home cook pizza this is definitely the place to takeout or delivery</Text>< gmapID>

Excellent service and absolutely delicious pizza. We ate in the restaurant and the wait staff was very helpful and polite. There are fun arcade games for the kids and pinball! Traditional classic pizza salad bar. Still, the salad bar was fresh and impeccably maintained. Their garlic knots are cheesy and fantastic!!< /Text>

Best Pizza place ever. Been here dozens of times. No need to worry how the pizza will taste. This place MAKES BOMB PIZZA. And they look well put together as if the person making them understands patience. The staff are great. They do their job. I pay $12 for a small pizza with numerous of toppings. They also gave me a free ROOT BEER on my first visit. I love Root Beer. I appreciate this place. Thank you for all you do to open your doors everyday for us hungry people. Keep it up. - James Apple<//Text>

<text>I love their pizza! Everyone there is super friendly. My favorite is the create your own. I love trying new things most times I do half & half just to switch it up 2 pizzas in one! Not to mention the dough is made fresh daily 🤗<//text>< Name>

Ordered from them yesterday for the first time and absolutely everything from the customer service to quality of food was outstanding. I ordered at 12 and they were here 32 minutes later with the correct order and pizza still hot. This is my new go to place in Rancho Cordova. Highly recommended!<//text>

I have to say, we order pizza almost every week, and Milan has been AMAZING. The employees are fantastic and when they have made a mistake they have called me to make it right. They called me before I could even call them! That's customer service. They know how to do pizza right. It always taste great and it feels good to order from a place with great customer service.<//Review>

<Review>The food here it's so very very delicious I love it so much especially the Buffalo chicken ranch pizza. Like OMG you can't even believe this place is conveniently located off highway 50 at the corner of sunrise and coloma. they have high-quality gluten-free crusts and oh boy are they yummy.

Some of the best pizza I’ve ever had, and the jalapeño poppers were perfect. Offered a free slice and 2L bottle of soda when I was picking up because they were having a slow night. Honestly I just moved into the area but I know I’ll only be going to these guys for pizza from now on. Plus the prices are dam good<//Review>

Wow,  this pizza was amazing. We got a coupon for the large, two topping pizza and could not believe how delicious it was. Leftovers, what little there was, were just as good the next day. Will definitely be eating there again. Thank you!< /text>

<Text>Nice deal - two large pizzas, a two liter soda, and cheese bread for a reasonable price came to about a total of $31 (excl. tip), but beyond the cheese bread things were on the blander side. I'll sprinkle a little garlic salt on it - I'm sure that'll do the trick. This was my first time ordering from them so I'm on the fence, but I took a risk.<//Text>< Pictures>

Amazing service!!We ordered for a delivery for my kids birthday party. Owner went above and beyond to not only deliver in time but texted me with a picture for me to decide how large is each slice for kids. Delivery was right on time with good hot pizza, couldn’t ask for more 👍👍<//text>

<Text>Milan Pizza has exceeded my expectations in customer service, quality and creative options. I've seen nothing but smiles from the delivery team and the folks on the phone are equally outstanding . I recently had a laughable experience with another pizza place and now will be exclusively ordering my pizza from Milan . Great job guys keep up the honest work< /Text><time>1549686975396</time>< pics>

<Date>1534660584589</Date><rating>1< /rating><Text>I decided to take advantage of a coupon to try this place out. The purpose of a coupon is to get people to try you out so you can get new customers. That's when you put your best foot forward. They were clearly unhappy that I chose to use a coupon, but they grudgingly agreed. They were extremely skimpy with the toppings. It was a garbage pizza. Either they don't know how to make pizza here, or they intentionally tried to rip me off by not giving me the deal I was entitled to. It is incredibly stupid to take a loss on a sale just to alienate a potential future customer rather than trying to keep him.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1534703813030, 'text': "Hi Jim, I am extremely disturbed to be reading this review seeing that this is not the kind of service I teach my staff. I am deeply sorry that you had such a horrible experience. However, I can't help but ask if you might have mistaken us for another pizza place called Milano Pizza in Sacramento. I had a customer who recently left a review for us accidentally about how they dined in at our location when in fact we don't have a sit down facility. If that's not the case, I do apologize again and hope you can reach out to me so I can make things right. I take a lot of pride in what I do, and it really bothers me that you walked away with such a bad impression of Milan Pizza. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon-Karen"}<//Resp><gmapID>0x809add838e091a89:0x4adbfffe563d6f9a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>If you need food fast, this is the place to go. Nevermind quality because they don't have any consistency. Some days their beans are burned others their taco shells are stale, there is never a time that everything is fresh and crisp. Fries are usually undercooked as well. Best option is their del Tacos...when they put enough cheese on them. 🤔< /text>< pics>

I receive excellent service today at this Del Taco from Dinette.
This Del taco is above average, the staff was friendly the dining room is clean and a lot of people seem to use it.
The food was fresh and as ordered.
Clearly a Del Taco doesn't compete with a steakhouse... But comparing this location to other Del Tacos, and other fast food options, they definitely stood out as clean, polite, and efficient.</Text>

Best Del Taco I've been to in awhile. And I've sadly been to many. One employee who stood out the most to me was Breanna. She definitely knows how to be personable, friendly, and make you feel like you're not just another car, even at 1am! Definitely made my horrible night a lot better just from her customer service.

Thank you! I'll be back</Text>

The burritos are a gamble in how much they put in it. Many times my burritos were skimpy and other times they might be huge. It's like rolling dice here.</text>

Restaurant was clean and food was delivered fast and hot. Staff was curteous and didn't hate that they were there. Ordered the chicken soft tacos and never let's me down. Food was fast which is why we stopped here. Employees were friendly and polite. Food was good. Impressive Bathroom was really clean.  Burrito was really big. Del Taco on Frederick in Moreno Valley is an enjoyable place to grab a quick Mexican meal at a reasonable price. The manager Irene keeps a great group of employees who always care about their customers. While I lived in town, I used to get my lunches there 3-4 times a week, always being able to stay in my budget. I am very thankful for the pride Irene displays in her store, and that is why I come to her store.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dca7f4ab1188fd:0x3e8188b30e8337ec</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

An AWESOME place to go for a family Breakfast. The environment and the employees are so sweet and family Oriented. We go there because of the Manager Bree, she is so sweet and our grand daughter lives to see her and gives her big hugs. It's more of a family Oriented place, where everyone knows everyone. If you haven't gone to Del Taco on Moreno Beach St. Then you need to go. Great food, and great people's and great employees. Go and ask for Bree, AWESOMENESS!!</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Very very disappointed in the food.  I asked when I ordered for HOT fries and we got cold and old grease taste.  And my red burrito, I asked for extra red sauce, extra cheese and add sour cream.  So NO sauce at all, i small dot of sour cream and absolutely no extra cheese. Then we were ready to go and needed a small bag and my daughter stood at the counter and 3 employees just kept walking passed her and never asked if she needed something for about 5 minutes.  What happened to customer service.  I worked at a Del Taco and it was all about the customers and the freshness of the food that would keep coming back.  So sad!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Del Taco on Frederick in Moreno Valley is an enjoyable place to grab a quick Mexican meal at a reasonable price. The manager Irene keeps a great group of employees who always care about their customers. While I lived in town, I used to get my lunches there 3-4 times a week, always being able to stay in my budget. I am very thankful for the pride Irene displays in her store, and that is why I come to her store. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK IRENE!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dca7f4ab1188fd:0x3e8188b30e8337ec</gmapID></record>

I like Del Taco, the food is very light to medium spicy. The french fries are good size. Their Taco Meat is nice their nachos are excellent. What really makes them especially good in our small town is it they're open all night. There's only a few places to go if you've got the late night munchies Del Tacos a good one.<//text>

Great customer service!
Edit: Normally Deltaco has not disappointed, but tonight they did. I ordered two separate meals, one order was done correctly, but the second order of Del Carbon Tacos were awful. Each taco shell was completely torn in half with all the meat falling out, the shells were stale, like they were microwaved too long. The chicken taste awful. I don't know who made them, but they should be ashamed of themselves. I will call them tomorrow and let them know about this, I want my money back. Customer service is still fantastic.< /text>

<user_id>107371620514109168559</user_id><Review>Wow, they have really gone down hill. The 1/2 pound bean and cheese burritos the last 10 times we have gone have weighed at 5.25 oz through 7.02. Two days ago I felt no weight after getting my bag. The burritos were so small I sent them back. We had been waiting for ever in the drive thru. They took forever and I drove through. I asked my son the check them. They were so small again. Felt way below the 5.25oz. So I parked and went in. No manager!! I let them know there was no excuse and to bring out their scale. They didn't. They remade them. I got home and weighted them as 7.75oz and 8.1 oz. So at least normal range. It really bothers me because they keep getting smaller when a half pound is a half pound, and the price has gone from .99 to $1.19!!!!<//Review>< Date>

<Review>The sad thing is I love Del Taco. But this store is the worst!! The girl that help at the register was good. But the manager was making the food. We got 2 chicken sneakers 1 had a good amount of chicken the 2nd one had like 3 small pieces. Did he think we wouldn't notice.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>I love Del Taco! The thing that I love is consistency no matter when or where it's always the same. That's what I expect from a chain fast food restaurant consistency. Today the drive-in employee forgot about me and left me out there for a minute or two. Accidents happen! That's for sure, but it's the attention to details and the customer service experience that makes a difference. I've been to this restaurant before and I will probably go back I won't hold this against them. What can I say stuff happens?? I usually get the number 9 which is a Del beef burrito,Fry's and a orginal taco and a mr. Pibb. What's your favorite combination to order?< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dca7f4ab1188fd:0x3e8188b30e8337ec<//GmapID></record>

< review>
Del taco located off the 60 freeway on Moreno Beach drive.  I walked into Del taco to place my order, and the person who took my order was Mr. Sergio, he has such an up beat personality and had a wonderful smile that made me feel good.  I normally order my food and go, but l decided to sit and eat my food there.  The tables and floor were clean and there was plenty of condiments.  My food was ready in no time so I sat down to eat and enjoyed the atmosphere which was quite nice inside.   I ordered the large del taco and a medium drink with a charro on the side, it was delicious.  Mr. Sergio thank you for making my day Pleasant with a wonderful smile and a great personality you are definitely a plus for the restaurant.  I Recommended this particular Del taco, its a Pleasant place to eat.   Walmart, Games stop, and other businesses are located in the same lot.  Plenty of parking and the parking lot is well lit at night.<//review>

<Text>I rate Del Taco pretty high compared to the other major taco place however not this specifically location. I live near this location and unfortunately every time in recent months I've used the drive-thru it took it over 15 minutes, the longest taking up to 25 minutes.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I came in on a Sunday afternoon and the dining area was very slow, but the drive-thru see very consistent with a steady stream of traffic. The food was good, not the best deltaco experience but average to above. I'll definitely be returning to this location.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

If I need a quick bite, and I'm near Moreno Beach, out of all the fast food I'll choose Del Taco. No matter how long the line is in the drive through, I always seem to get through super quick. Is the food the best? With any fast food it's always up in the air, and of course every location relatively stays the same, but I can say it's always good food, and they actually care to make their deluxe chilli cheese fries deluxe. Some places do a spurt of sour creme and the fries are dry, not here!<//text>

< Review>
Im a very loyal customer to this del taco but im getting sick of the people who work at night not getting orders right. I asked for extra secret sauce and barley got any at all i also asked for side of green sauce and mild and didnt get any at all. Im going to start going to the other del taco up the street because they actually listen to what you asked for.</Review>

<text>It's not my problem your speaker doesn't work for the drive-thru. Don't ask me or tell me to back up. If I can hear you and you can hear me, press your stupid fast food button. I don't really care. Fix your garbage drive-thru system.< /text>< name>

I’m so happy with my meal today! The host Bryanna was so nice and genuine considering she took my order at 1:00 am :) The food was freshly made and everything was perfect! I believe it is very important to take note of the good work people put in. Thank you Bryanna!<//Review>

Just went in on 2/4/18 at around 1:50am.  Staff is extremely rude and undertrained.  The employee taking orders not only forgot his headset was still on but he had the nerve to complain about there being customers and having to work.  After complaining for a bit he realized his headset was on and didn't even apologize for being so rude.  I didn't even order anything because they'll probably make it wrong.</text>

< review>
Waited there for 10 minutes just waiting to order food. And the whole entire time I watched them fill orders they were so very disorganized. I really don't know who is in charge of that store. Also I was Charged an extra .40 cents for jalapeños and didn't get them. Yeah can't even get an order right and they want $15 an hour!<//review>

<text>Stopped here to grab a bite on our way home from the casino and even though there was only one small family of three other than me and my bf they took forever and the employees were arguing and bickering with each other over ridiculous minor things and there was only one napkin dispenser that was hidden as far in the corner of the ordering counter and they didn't give or offer us any at anytime so after having to get our food I had to get back up and hunt down some napkins while an employee watched me with a dumb look on his face 🙄 Should've taken 5 minutes but took 45!< /text>< pictures>
