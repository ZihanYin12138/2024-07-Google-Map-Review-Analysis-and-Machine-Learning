< review>
If you're thinking of having Thai food, don't make the mistake we did by eating at this place.  We ordered 9 different dishes and they were all the same taste!  No Thai flavors or spices at all, everything was drenched in the brown generic sauce served in bad Chinese restaurants. The owner must think his customers aren't sophisticated enough to  know the difference, and judging by some of the honest(???) reviews they obviously don't.<//review>

It's our first time ordering from here and the food was delicious! My sister got Chicken Pad Thai, and I got Tofu Pad Thai and Thai iced tea. After ordering, it was delivered in 20 minutes, still hot/warm!! Never have I ever had such fast, fresh food delivered to my door!! The food was 5/5, we loved it--and we are avid Pad Thai fans. Definitely recommend if you're craving pad Thai or any Thai food! Thank you for the positive experience!</review>< Pictures>

Fantastic food. Quick service. Not crowded. Ordered the coconut soup, pad thai, & yellow curry with chicken, after tasting probably would've gone meatless. Friendly folks. Economical prices. Nearby street parking avail. I would definitely return!!

One caveat the waitress told us the online prices are outdated; the current menu prices are $2-$3 more per item than the less expensive prices listed online. It'd be nice if they updated that so the prices would match.<//Text>

<Text>There like 4 Thai cafes on Westwood Blvd practically next to each other, all staying in business for over 2 decades! This one is my favorite so far. Has little dated decor, but food is good, same as prices. I eat at all of them hundreds of times  and this one I think have more fresh ingredients and little cheaper. Love lunch menu prices!<//Text></record>

I went to this place pretty often, maybe twice a month at least. The food was always fast, tasty and a great price. I love all their types of curry the most. But their fried rice is a close second. The pad thai was good as well. And their thai tea and coffee were a constant, every time I went I got one or the other. I'd tell everyone to come here as you can't go wrong.< /Review>

One of the best Thai places I've been to. Has a small, hole in the wall vibe, and doesn't look particularly elegant or cute, but is kinda charming nonetheless. The portions are huge and prices are fairly good for a Thai place, making this the go-to Thai place in the area.< /review>

Good place if you want fast service for good food relative to its price.  Not fine dining... but a good lunch spot or a last minute quick fix for Thai food on the a tight schedule.  I will repeat attendance in those occasions.<//Text>

<user_name>Jessica Castillo<//user_name><rating>2< /rating><response>None<//response><Text>We ordered the Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea. I placed the pick-up order over the phone, and mentioned the check-in offer for the Thai iced tea. They wouldn't honor the offer, but didn't seem to completely understand. Regardless, I proceeded to order 2 of them. When I arrived for pick-up, I showed the check-in offer to the cashier. She still wouldn't honor it, so I proceeded to pay. After receiving my receipt, I realized I was charged more for my Pad Thai than what was stated on the menu. The cashier didn't seem to care, and started to walk off. I stopped to check my order to make sure it was all correct, when another woman came by and said they would honor the check-in by giving me another (a third) Thai iced tea. I told her that I didn't need a third, and declined the offer. She then said that I needed to let them know about the offer when I placed the order, to which I replied I had. She looked at the cashier, whom must have said something about the situation, and murmured something to her before turning to me and saying "Well, we can't do anything about it since you already paid." Obviously, it wasn't a big deal to me since I had still ordered and paid for my entire original order. I think it was a bigger deal that I was overcharged for my food, and they didn't care. After I was able to check my order for completion, I thanked them and left.

Once home, we were looking forward to enjoying our Pad Thai, but were quickly let down as our food had absolutely no flavor! I've never experienced Pad Thai lack flavor, which is pretty bad in my opinion. It's almost like they forgot to add ingredients. Needless to say, we will not be returning 😕</Text><UserId.>109564050239968664352< /UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

As we were adding the sauces, not one, but two separate employees came over to tell us we were not allowed to eat at the table. We could only guess that it was because our orders were packaged to go as opposed to being on plates, because they never bothered to explain why they were ushering us out so unceremoniously after we spent nearly $50. The problem wasn't that the rule exists, it was the way they approached us. In fairness the second person was apologetic, but did it really take two people? There is something to be said for customer interaction.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>We ordered online for pick up. Food was pretty good and was prepared quickly.
The reason I took away 3 stars is only because of their email spamming. I specifically checked not to be put on a mailing list, yet I have been receiving emails with coupons at least once a week, and THERE IS NO LINK TO UNSUBSCRIBE from their stupid emails. I also cannot reply, because it's an automated mail.  I live in Chicago, I was in LA only for a couple of days, what am I gonna do with coupons to a restaurant that's 2000 miles away? Isn't also illegal to be spamming customers with promo emails without providing means to be unsubscribed? I'm pretty sure it is. Horrible business practice, you don't even deserve the 2 stars.</review>< Pics>

<text>The food is VERY good. I've been a customer for many years. However,  the customer service/relations is non-existent. If there is any dispute or complaint, the limited-English speaking employees play dumb and act as if they don't understand. I have been trying to contact the owner for weeks. She has NEVER called be back.<//text>< Rate>

Food is beyond bad. Ordered thai Red curry as delivery order. One bite and threw it right in the trash. Never had such bad Thai food in LA. Chicken was all dark meat. The curry itself was smelly and just awful. Absolute waste of money.< /review>

My go to Thai spot in West LA. Staff is so nice and very attentive. I love the chicken paradise or the thai chicken wings. Yes, I know the chicken wings aren't really thai but if you ask for extra extra hot, they're amazing. The thai curry, pad thai and rat na is pretty good.</Text>

Taste: not great but is ok enough to fulfill a craving.

I definitely would not stop looking for a good Thai place yet.<//Text>

Food is okay but not exceptional.  Prices are average for Thai food. There is no restroom in the restaurant and only metered street parking.</Review>

I’ve eaten at many Thai places on the Westside and this among the worst. Food is bland and quality of the ingredients is poor. It took them two hours to deliver our food, no wonder the delivery is free.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I went about twice.
All are normally delicious and cheap! Because there is a volume, you can not eat even noodles or rice, soup, maine. I like pad Thai and fried rice (chicken) because they are sweet and spicy.

Charged my husband $40 for a set after they quoted $25. Plain white set, no frills and she did my daughters middle left fingernail crooked. It was her birthday nails too. She told the lady it was crooked and the lady said "it your finger that's crooked". Um no? We aren't going back.<//Text>

<text>Update: Let me again say this place is great and I'm sorry about the typos on this review they have been corrected. Lol
I took my sons girlfriend and her best friend to get their nails done. My friend told me about this place, she just had hers done and was very happy with the price she paid and the job they did. We got there and they were busy so we signed in and went thru the options. It's a Very clean establishment and although they were busy they had plenty of help so the wait time was not long. The girls were thrilled with their painted nails and the price was  very affordable. The ladies were very pleasant and we plan on going back soon</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1552198151322, 'text': 'Thank Lori    We hope to see you .'}< /Resp><gmapID>0x8093fc3e57d917c3:0x296c5b92d82cd58<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I been living in Chowchilla for 10 years, I keep having bad experiences with v nails salon but unfortunately I keep going back, employees are very rude  and they make you wait forever even if you have an appointment , today I went to my 6 pm app, waited 20 min to be seated and when it was finally my turn I waited another 15 min to just seaton an  empty soaking tub  ,( yes no water tub) I decided to get up,  put back the nail polish I had picked and walked out of there feeling so upset . I understand that if you just do a walk in chances are you are going to have to wait until your turn but appointments!!! Come onnnnn!!! And what's more sad that is not the first time , ( just like the jerk of a boyfriend you know he's not good for you but you keep going back😭) Chowchilla deserves a good,  friendly  nail salon. I guess I'll just start doing my own nails or make the drive to Merced or Madera .<//Review>

It wasn’t a good experience. The tech did not cut my nails before starting. She charged me so much for a simple color with no design. & on top of that, she had made one of my nails crooked. I wouldn’t recommend this & i definitely won’t be returning.< /text>

Overall , great customer service & chairs with massage during pedicure! I love this place , not a big or fancy salon but I can find in here a quiet place to relax . The services are not perfect but I see they try their best to satisfy the need of customers , so I still rate as 5 Stars salon .<//Review>

Terrible establishment....went there to get nails done & the lady spent more time on her phone then she did doing my nails, and she did a horrible job at that. And when I got a pedicure they did a horrible job, charged me for gel when I didn’t even want gel & if you pay with a credit card be careful, they tried to say my card wasn’t charged & That I had to pay cash. I even showed them my credit card statement on my phone showing the charge & they tried to argue over it. Would not recommend this place to no one.<//Review>

The polish job wasn't any better. Again someone else had to help clean up the smudges around the nails and in doing so my toe was clipped causing it to bleed a great deal. I paid and left with a bad pedi and bloody toe.</Review>< rate>

I had booked a private course with Seth through Ocean Enterprises for my Advanced PADI certifications and could not have been happier. Seth is very knowledgeable and accommodating and ensured that we covered the dive plans and discussed any potential hazards before the dives. The shop is a little inland so expect to be hauling tanks and any rental gear back and forth, but the very friendly service and reasonable prices make up for it.
Would definitely come back for my next diving needs.<//review>

Whether you are debating on getting your scuba certification or you are deciding on what company to go through, you will not regret choosing Ocean Enterprises. I was indifferent about getting my certification, but my instructors (Kym, Rob and Pedro) were so passionate and knowledgable, you can't help but love it. They equip you with unmatched information and are insanely awesome people. Even at the dive shop getting equipment, every associate is very bubbly and there with your best interest. Incredible team in every aspect of the company.</Text>

<review>For everyone looking to do Open Water Diver, here are the prices:
~$225 for the course (includes the main scuba rental items)
~$180 for the PADI e-learning (cannot be shared with anyone else)
~$50 for the guidebook, dive log, etc.
And you need to have fins (~$100), snorkel (~$40), mask (~$50), booties (~$50), and gloves (~$30), which can be rented ($40 per day?) or purchased (prices above).
Total is roughly $750.
Would be nice if this were quoted on the site.

Another thing you aren't made aware of on the course sign-up: you will have to drop off/pick up your air tanks from the store. You borrow two at a time and need one tank for every dive. This meant that for a course I took, I needed to visit the store 5 times for pick up/drop off of air/equipment. (We had four pool dives, 4 ocean dives. And actually we had to go an extra time, but that was unexpected.) A lot of extra driving and time I wasn't expecting, when the course is already quite demanding!

All the pool dives were completed within 2 or 3 hours, never 4 as quoted. We rarely went below 2000 psi on our tanks (though ymmv). Felt like those skill learnings could've been condensed into 2 or 3 days.

The orientation was OK, but felt more like a sales event for the "snorkeling" gear. I definitely felt pressured to buy and the orientation part did not feel meaningful--could have been accomplished online or on the night of the first pool dive.

The people in the rental department were pretty cool - I liked their calendar with random "holidays" - yoga day, rocky road day, etc.

Then there were the vagaries of the particular course I took, which I don't feel like getting into. Suffice to say, I'm getting my advanced cert at another shop in the area.

It wasn't the worst experience, but wasn't great either. I did get stoked to keep diving! But for how much money you're spending, it'd be nice to receive a consistently positive quality of service.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I always wanted to be a diver and finally decided to the jump! This dive shop came highly recommended by a friend and I literally can’t say enough good things about the people that I met and that taught me how to get open water certified! Everything from communication and expectations through the course were above and beyond. I actually forgot to pick up my dive gear before the pool certs and the shop called me giving me the heads up to come get the gear. Which to me really showed the business cares about helping you become a diver versus making money which is really important to me in a business I support. Because they could’ve easily had me make my mistake and charged me for rescheduling.

The instructor staff was awesome, attitude and knowledge wise I had Trevor/Allie for my pool time and Donovan/ Jessie for our open water dives. Not a single bad experience just awesome times taking my first steps into the world of diving thanks to the instructors. Even when I was getting helped at the store and fitted for gear or what to buy, I never felt pressured to buy or rushed and the knowledge demonstrated by the staff was awesome definitely coming here as long as I live in the San Diego area.<//text><Rate>5<//Rate><GmapID>0x80dbff930ed63f79:0x167f0302b050719b</GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

If you’re debating about getting certified for scuba diving - this is your sign to do it! I recently took the Open Water certification with Ocean Enterprises and I felt very prepared, confident, and had a ton of fun. My instructor (shout-out to Andrew) was so encouraging and shared lots of his experiences to get us excited for diving trips. Can't wait to use my new skills!<//Review>

Best dive shop in San Diego by far. Amazing selection, very customer focused and have a great staff of avid divers to help along the way. It is hard to find another place that has the range of products, especially the higher end items by scubapro/aqualung etc.< /text>

From the moment I walked in the customer service was excellent! The sales lady was knowledgeable and answered all my questions. It is a large store for a dive shop, but that meant more selection. If I need anything else for diving or scuba, this is my now go to shop.<//Text>

These comments apply to the SERVICE DEPARTMENT. The service staff are exceedingly well trained and qualified to repair most scuba equipment. They have serviced my gear for at least 10 years and their work has been excellent. I trust them to do the repairs right. They do.<//Text>

I’ve been diving with Ocean Enterprises for three years now and it has always been an enjoyable experience. Continuing education with their instructors or the knowledge of their shop and repair staff has been great.  Also their travel wing has put together some great trips!!< /text>

<review>My husband and I came to San Diego to do a great white shark dive . We were ill prepared since Georgia doesn’t carry much 7mm stuff . My husband had called before hand and spoke to Hanna who happened to actually be at the store when we showed up. She was so amazing and patient in helping us choose the right gear for our dive . She was knowledgeable and provided many different options from suits to masks and even different Go Pro accessories . Our dive would have been impossible for us without her . Our gear was perfect from head to toe and kept us warm the whole entire trip. We are so happy we purchased the suits instead of renting them because we want to use them for future dives since they were that awesome. If you go to this store ask for Hanna because she will hook you up and get you exactly what you are looking for . I can’t wait to visit the dive shop again next trip. Thanks Hanna!</review><date>1568752127090<//date>< user_name>

<Text>Great scuba store. Friendly, professional and good products. They are one of the best scuba repair service shops in SD. I have bought gear for me and my girlfriend many times.  I showed up 5 minutes before closing with faulty BCD. They gladly looked into the problem and had it diagnosed and fixed, by replacing the dump valve o-ring. We were out the door in 5 minutes and still able to get back out to La Jolla for a lobster dive that night. Awesome service, great shop. Thanks, Ocean Enterprise!< /Text>< date>

I couldn’t have asked for a better Open Water Certification class and instruction. The instructors, gear, teaching, and process were very professional and help you understand all aspects of diving. Their #1 goal is to make sure that you are safe and are taught the right habits early to begin your dive career. Spend the money and get certified the right way. If you are looking to save some money, wait until they have their Tent Sale. It’s a great way to grab gear and classes at a discounted rate. Thanks OE!<//review>

I have taken many classes with Ocean Enterprises over the years, the consistency, safety and professionalism, is what makes me and my family come back to this shop.
Nobody else goes the extra mile like these PADI instructors.
The shop keeps up with the latest trends, and brands and the staff is knowledgeable and pleasant, always helpful and actually legit involved into diving.
If it wasn't for the vibe there I would probably had become only a warm water diver, but these people kept me excited about the sport.
Thank you OE Team!<//text>

Ocean Enterprises and the entire OE team are a fantastic resource if you're diving in San Diego, or if you want to get into diving for the first time! I've done all of my advanced designations through them, and their team is absolutely top notch. Every person that works there is a diver, and they are all educated on their products, and are always willing to help answer any questions about a new gear purchase!</review>

<review>I've been a customer there since day one.  Always enjoy a visit.  Their service department has kept me safe forever.  Seeing complaints about staff surprised me.  They all do their best and are helpful and will patiently answer questions.  You can always get expert advise since they have some very experienced staff.  When they are really busy they can get swamped especially during a sale or tent sale.  All the players in the dive industry try to have a rep on site for the Tent Sales.  They have price matching so the complaints about high prices are not fair.  I occasionally check out the other local shops but nobody has their selection.  I've also had other shops work on my stuff when necessary and was disappointed to say the least.   They've been in business for the longest time for a reason.<//review>< Pics>

Kristy, Kelly, Jacob, Alex, and Rocio are always so helpful! As an independent instructor they make my life easy when it comes to the logistics-side of running my courses. They care about your safety, comfort, and success as a diver and understand that we as an industry must be a team in order to enjoy what we do and grow as instructors and individuals. Take a course here and absolutely go in for gear-fittings and advice on gear selection.< /Text>

I absolutely love Ocean Enterprises!  Their instructors helped us get our open water certification and we kept going after that.  Right now we are doing our Divemaster certification with OE.  We have purchased all of our equipment from them and they have stood behind all their products 100%.  The good thing about buying from a local shop is that you now have a place to fill air.  The more you can buy local the better off we all are.  I recommend buying the air card and your fills will be a fraction of the cost.  Their repair shop is awesome and very reasonably priced.  How can you put a price on your life!  I can be cost conscious in many areas of my life, but this is not one of them!  We have also done many fun events with OE and will continue doing them in the future.  Great job to all the staff at OE, why go anywhere else.  Oh yeah the other cool thing...they all know us by name now so it is kind of like Norm on Cheers!</Review>

<user>111210939257147934655<//user><Text>I had tried scheduling open water certification dives with a different shop in San Diego and was struggling to get clear communication, so I switched to Ocean Enterprises last minute.  Kaylie made scheduling a dream, diligently taking care of everything last minute.  She even emailed me back after 10pm one night!  Misty was also a pleasure to work with in equipment rentals.

Once we had our equipment, my wife & I set off with Jay (our instructor) to review our skills in a pool before hitting the ocean.  He was very detailed and was patient with us (it took us awhile to don our 7mm wetsuits).  Jay made sure that we displayed proper skills before deciding it was time to head to the ocean.

Upon arriving at the ocean, it turned out that conditions were too hazardous for diving.  It was the same story the next day, so unfortunately we were not able to complete our open water dives during our vacation.  However, the shop was very fair about refunding our money for the open water dives.  They charged us for the pool time but not for the equipment, even though we had it for two days waiting for good weather.

If I'm ever back in San Diego, I will go straight to Ocean Enterprises for my diving needs.<//Text><Name>Jamie Cecil</Name><time>1395345999049</time>< Pics>

Camille Rice was the dive professional that helped me out. We actually had alot of fun finding out about some of the equipment together. Camille was incredibly helpful while not being pushy or impatient as I took quite awhile to decide on what equipment I wanted. Most fun $1000.00 I have spent in awhile. Great job Camille 🤗</Review>< gmap_id>

Things are all a bit overpriced. Bought Mares bungee strap for my fins last week and it costs $10 more than the other local dive shop that I visited. Scuba classes are fine. Instructors are professional, experienced, encouraging and dedicated. They have lots of interesting dive stories and useful tips to tell.<//Text>

Walked into this place with a fin in my hand. Spent several minutes trying to get somebodies attention. Couldn't even get anybody to make eye contact. I didn't need help immediately, but if their employees cant even let you know that they will get to you in a minute, then... there were about 6 customers in the store and at least 4 employees.</review>

<UserId.>109598078907347486669</UserId.><text>The best place in San Diego for all your dive gear!  Kristy was phenomenal in ensurIng I got exactly what I wanted when I went to the store for new dive gear. When I wasn’t totally happy with my chosen unused bcd and computer, Kristy patiently worked with me to determine exactly what I wanted, and found the suitable replacements for exchange. After all her assistance,  I love all my new gear and can’t wait to go back to OE for more accessories, even though I have exactly what I need and then some.

OE certified me in 2003 and they are still providIng value after all these years. Thank you Kristy, Claire, and the service department for your patience and professionalism. I am a very happy diver and love my new equipment!< /text></record></dataset><record>

It’s hands down the best dive shop in SD. They provide lots of scuba equipment -head to toe- and lots of brands to buy from. Rental gear are new and are in great condition.< /Review>

Service department is a joke.  They look out for their wallet and not the customer.  They think they are the scuba safety patrol and need to "make you safe" at every turn, usually resulting in more money pouring out of your wallet.</Review>

I went here to get PADI certified and was treated with the utmost respect. Being in the navy I deal with a lot of hurry up and waiting along with courses where you get certified that are all education and no fun but that definitely wasn't the case here. I learned everything I needed and felt comfortable enough to dive many times off of grand cayman island. I went to their tent sale as well and realized anyone who wants to start diving and has some money saved up needs to go to this sale, they have everything available and for prices anyone can afford. This is a great place to be whether your a new guy just looking for answers or an old pro that needs the best gear out there.<//Text>

Went there for the first time today, I found the customer service and prices to be excellent. I was able to get a tank & valve for a much better price than anything I found on the internet. Staff was very friendly and helpful, will buy more diving supplies from them in the future.< /text>

Went in to get a new mask, and they didn't have the colour I wanted but they were going to order it. There was miscommunication and it didn't arrive in tjme before I left the San Diego area. I called them and they apologized profusely and were very accommodating for my upcoming dive. Since the mask I ordered still wasn't going to arrive in time, they overnighted me the same mask but in another colour for free and my other mask arrived a day later. They were wonderful with the misunderstanding and making sure I was happy with everything. I would go back there any time I was in the area!
Thank you guys!< /text>

<Review>The girls that work there are really rude. Looks like we are doing a favor to buy there. One was more interested in texting, other one want us to leave ( showing the exit) and other really upset to explain about the gear. The guys are nicer. I was buing wetsuit, light and BC, and wanted to know about brands, prices... Looks like I was disturbing the girls... I bought what I need, but I don't think to come back there anymore.</Review></record>

< review>
The most expensive prices I've ever seen.
My bottles which are in date, were labled with stickers from a rival dive supply company. My bottles were refused, The 'lead bottle tech' said i could take them back or i would have to buy two new bottles@ 500$ each.  When i asked specifically WHY , he responded with "they are LUXFERs we havent charged those in years and years.."
He just wanted to make me buy new bottles.

I refuse to support a business who seeks to screw over its fellow brother.</review>

<rating>2< /rating><text>Definitely not your typical dive shop, and that is not a good thing. Being located within an office building should have tipped me off immediately but I proceeded to do business with them anyway because they are one of the very few PADI 5 Star IDC dive shops in San Diego. Upon entering you can tell this is a large organization and, as I continued to learn each time I visited over the past two years, has lost (or never had) the customer service touch within its bloated walls.

Staff is very hard to find - nary a greeting upon entrance. Sales staff, once identified and made aware you are an interested customer, provided good service. However looking for them becomes a chore that an organization with as many people on the payroll should not suffer.

On the service side, which is almost a completely different company within the Enterprise, seems out of touch with the meaning of customer relations. My most recent interaction with this staff resulted in a passive-aggressive attitude that is not required nor desired. The dive industry has for the most part eliminated the 'holy than thou' attitude, but it remains with these individuals. I tried attempting to correct this in person but unable to find a manager in a timely manner proved impossible (see previous paragraph).

Nothing negative to report on the rental side - that is a well run shop. But just like the service side, it is a completely separate 'company' internal to the Enterprise. What happens in one, stays there - it appeared there was no cross-talking between their systems.

Pricing: out of this world. Very large selection of items but each are priced very high. Items displayed as 'on sale' are marked down to the MSRP. Regulator service is also over-priced by a very large margin in what must be an attempt to make a nice profit. To maintain the Enterprise, one must charge the customers through the roof.

And finally, the little things that add up. Store opening on weekends is 0900 - how do you expect to service divers opening at such a late hour? Open at the latest by 0700. Social media marketing galore - but what supports these claims? Another 'business' focused on corporate sales - you can start to get the idea that the primary business model isn't focused on the individual customer.

I wanted to like this establishment but the Enterprise is just too big for itself. Have a look at how many instructors they have - 34 plus 13 assistant instructors/divemasters! I can't speak to how they excel on the instruction side but to maintain such a beast of an instructor pool doesn't come cheap.  Based on the high prices, the poor attitudes, and the lackluster service, I am no longer a patron of this dive shop.</text>< pics>

One stop shop for anything Scuba and my "go to" place.  Best customer service I have had in any type of retail store.  I received my Advanced certification, Night Diver cert, drysuit cert, EFR and now signed up for Rescue Diver all through OE.  The staff is amazing and extremely helpful.  They are always laughing, always have smiles on their faces and without a doubt love what they do. I have dove with several of their instructors and DMs since becoming a regular here and they are always a good time.
I started as a clueless open water diver and now have the goal of being a DM with OE.<//text>

<text>My wife and I came up to Tiberon on our most recent visit San Francisco. We decided to take the ferry over and we were amazed to find a very quaint downtown area were this candy store is located. The experience and atmosphere of the shop was charming. It added to an already pleasant visit to Tiberon.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Discriminates:Every time I have taken the ferry to Angel Island I stop at this candy shop, this time the reward for going in a hike for my daughter. We are in the store and not even 4 minutes later a police officer walks in. Following me, my boyfriend and daughter. Going as far as standing right next to by boyfriend while paying. I guess being Hispanic and black in a predominantly white neighborhood us a bad thing. Seeing the whispering between the employees was a dead give away that they called them. I will never go here again. I am warning anyone that is not white to never go there either. This was the most uncomfortable situation in my life.<//Review><GmapID>0x8085847d1be8d061:0xdec3c339374bdcca<//GmapID><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Cute little spot perfectly situated for a gluttonous grab and go treat.  The prices are ok, but the quality of product is hit and miss.  I can't be sure, but I am pretty positive they don't rotate stock, *at all*.  The zotz were ancient and basically melted goo, other candies were "gamey" and tasted old.. like gummy that sort of dissapated into granular sugar, etc.  So it's going to be hit and miss.  The chocolate counter has some awesome stuff (DARK CHOCOLATE HONEYCOMB!) and the ice cream is okay, if you like Dreyers.  There's a more "modern" ice cream and treat shop by New Morning which has hip ice cream and other treats.....

I end up here during a vigorous constitutional, from time to time, and happily destroy the intent of my walk with a tasty treat.  They have all the classics - ring pops, lik-a-made, and more....  enjoy responsibly. =)</text>< user_name>

However I'm giving it a 4 star because I feel like the fried rice was a tad bit under flavored compared to other similar Chinese Food places I've been to like this (for example like Hong Kong Express in Fullerton, their fried rice is a little bit more flavored, but this comes in at a close second place for me).< /review>< UserId.>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>I thoroughly enjoyed the Teriyaki bowl from Golden Gate. It was a nice-sized piece of chicken breast that they chopped into slices and served over a bowl of fried rice. You may request white rice instead. I couldn't determine if lo mein could also be substituted. The rice wasn't all that, but the Teriyaki more than made up for it.

The space is small wit a couple of 4-seater booths and three or four 2-seater booths. It's set up buffet style with several of their most popular items in steam trays: fired rice, kung pao, sesame, beef /broccoli, egg rolls, shrimp. You may also order a la carte. For drinks they have a soda machine with coke products and they also have BANG! drinks which seem to be pretty popular in this area. Almost every QSR I've been too has them outside of the big chains.

A flat screen is situated over the seating area. You can't really watch it while you're dining. I think its for the staff.

The previous reviews are hit or miss which I attribute to new restaurant blues and growing pains. Again, its nothing to write home about, but if you're looking for decent Chinese fast food this is your place and it'll be mine for the forseeable future.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My car was due for some recall services.  Circle Porsche called me to schedule a visit, they sent me a kind text reminder day before, and when I got there morning of, everything was ready to go including a loaner Porsche.  Not only was the recall fixed but I also got a car wash.  Now, I am not writing because I just got a car wash but because the car has some scratches on it that not even a previous professional detail took out but when I went to pick up my car, the scratches were gone!  Circle Porsche went above and beyond to use appropriate chemicals they have to remove these scratches without even me asking and it was just a pleasant surprise later that day when I got home.  This place is such a family-feel place.  Great job to the owners for making the employees feel at home and therefore they make the customers feel at home.</Review>

My daughter found this dealer. It was one of the few dealers that had the car my daughter wanted. Brett Rajotte was awesome! He was super helpful, patient, and personable. Matt also instrumental. We weren't here as long as we had expected. Both guys assisted us in having a great experience.<//Text>

Visited Circle Porsche as tag-along with a family member. Brett Rajotte was there to greet me, showed me around and allowed me to test drive couple vehicles. Wasnt on the market for anything but if you are, allow Brett and Circle Porsche to look after you! Fantastic experience, Thanks again Brett!<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Edit: based on the response below I called this afternoon. Asked to speak to a manager in the sales department. After holding for 3min the phone was disconnected. It’s been extremely frustrating to continue putting time into getting this resolved. It sounds like you have our contact info, maybe you reach out to schedule something?

We purchased a Cayenne from here about a year ago. They promised to fix a paint spot on the rear bumper after purchase. We contacted our sales person several times and can’t get the services promised. They apologize that it hadn’t happened yet, promise to take action, but still haven’t followed through. After reaching out a handful of times I’ve given up on them honoring this fix.

We love our Porsche but suggest looking for another dealership that prioritizes customer satisfaction.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I had a most wonderful experience working with the gentlemen in the parts dept. They were all very helpful. I am in awe of their talent and knowledge.  If you find yourself with a ding in your Porsche, or you just want a new updated gadget, these gentlemen are excellent, and quick at finding just what you need. An "Excellent Award" from me.< /Text>

Whether it is your first one, or your fifth one, Circle Porsche have always left me very satisfied with my purchase. When I was looking to buy a Macan S, David Mercado showed me all the features of the car and brought me on a test drive. He is very knowledgeable about the product. Eric, the manager, gave me a good deal and catered to my lease needs. Would definitely come back in the future.< /text>< pictures>

I'm very happy with the experience I received from circle Porsche, I worked with David Nidess and he was very professional and very knowledgeable. I was able to test drive the car ask questions and I felt his responses were  accurate with years of experience. Next time I buy a new car I will return and look for Dave, cause he was supportive in all aspects especially in his efficiency to get me in and out with no wasted time.</Review>

<Review>Having now purchased 7 new Porsches from Eric Ernst in the last 10 years we are still totally elated with the experience.   This young man is beyond good.   He has our business hands down going forward.  He is honest, down to earth and knows his product 100 percent.   We pass his competitor driving to Long Beach and never regret the extra 25 miles.</Review>< Pictures>

An amazing experience from start to finish. I was dealing with three different dealers and the reason I chose Circle was due to the transperancy of the staff, the professional service and their ability to make you feel like you are the most important customer. Will definitely use Chris and the team at Circle for my next Porsche purchase.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Jonathan Arena was great to work with, very knowledgeable but not nigh-pressure. We were in Southern California for a visit and thought one of Circle's Boxsters might be for us. Turns out it wasn't but Jonathan helped us configure a special order we thought seriously about pursuing. Had he had a car in stock we would not have hesitated to proceed. We highly recommend Jonathan and  Circle Porsche for their expertise, friendliness and straight-forward approach. We have dealt with several Porsche dealers and sales reps up and down the West Coast in our search, and Jonathan was second to none.<//review><response>None</response>< gmapID>

This review is based on their parts dept.

I sent an email requesting cost for parts and labor for a steering wheel replacement. I gave them 3 different steering wheel options I was interested in.

I received an email from Marlon Vargas, informing me only one option of the three worked. He gave me the parts number. But no cost estimate on parts and labor.

I wrote to him on two different occasions within a two week time frame asking for a quote on parts and labor, but no response.

He finally responds and simply says "I can't give you cost on labor you have to call the service department for installation." Are you kidding me?

Two weeks delay, I reached out politely twice and all I get in return is Marlon telling me to contact another department? He STILL didn't give me a price quote. I've contacted other Porsche dealers in the Southern California area and all of them have provided me the information that Marlon couldn't.

He clearly doesn't care about taking care of customers and his lack of response and lack of effort in reasearching my question shows he's in the wrong business.

Poor communication, poor explanations, and it's so blatant, I will never do business with them and will ensure my friends and family are aware.

I did contact Marlon's manager Steve who responded quicky and his peer, Nate, provided me the information I requested in less than 10 minutes. That is not an exaggeration, 10 minutes. What Nate could do in 10 minutes, Marlon couldn't do in 2 weeks.

Again, this review is strictly on their parts department.</review>

Dealership is currently being remodeled so finding parking is a challenge. Was a bit disappointed to drive all the way the to buy floor mats after using their love text service confirming they had it in stock. Parts guy was very courteous but ultimately left empty handed because he was unable to locate said floor mat. But they did have some cool free swag like grocery bag and desktop calendar.< /review>

<review>I have purchase 3 cars from this auto dealership and have consistently maintained each car with the respective service departments.  In my latest service at Porsche I was upsold yet another item that was questionably necessary. Still, believing the tech, I went ahead and bought the new battery.  Needless to say that after they sold this to me they admitted that I had purchased a battery within the last couple of years.  Upon arriving to pick up my car, which I paid nearly over $900 for a routine oil change and replacement battery, the car was filthy and was trapped behind several other cars in their lot.  I had to wait an extended period of time for the techs to locate keys for the cars on their lot.  Took quite a while.  I recommend that if your porsche is not under warranty, save time and significant amount of money and find another service location.  They over charge for their service and immensely disappoint on trying to make things right.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Joseph Grimaldi was such a pleasure to work with. I will definitely buy my next porsche trough him. He was very honest and extremely knowledgeable about the product. If you want a salesman who goes the extra mile and doesn't just focus on the deal this is your guy.< /text>

I recently lease a Panamera S E-Hybrid from Circle Porsche.  Their sales team was very professional and took excellent care of me.  I dealt with David Mercado (Sales), and Eric Ernst (General Sales Manager).  They were very upfront and honest about everything and were easy to deal with. During the sales process David Mercado spending hours with me going over every possible detail about the car. David provided the best service anyone could ask for when purchase/leasing a 100k plus car. His attentiveness, attention to detail and follow up was excellent.  Eric Ernst was also very helpful in finding me the best lease deal I could get.  The experience was smooth even thru the financial and record recording end. Everyone did their job well.  I would recommend Circle Porsche to anyone who is looking for an easy professional purchase from start to finish.<//Review>

<Review>My 2014 Cayenne Diesel was picked up by Circle Porsche on 12/12/17 in order to complete the "Emissions Compliant Repair", and perform a requested oil and filter change. I received the vehicle back from the dealer on 12/19, and after driving approximately 10 miles received a notice on the instrument panel stating "Oil level minimum reached". I called Domenic Macchia, Service Advisor, and asked that the vehicle be picked up and serviced properly. Domenic informed me he would see when he had a loan car available, and would call me back within one hour. As of 01/02/18 I still had not heard from Domenic.
On 12/28, 12/30, and 01/02/18 I telephoned the General Manger, Eric Ernst and left a message each time, with the hope of receiving assistance with this matter. Still no return call.
Bottom-line, you probably want to think twice about having your Porsche serviced here.</Review><resp>None< /resp><Name>Wayne Jonas< /Name><Gmap_id>0x80dd3191375c64af:0xb9137df83a4ac484<//Gmap_id><user>109554322257991397436<//user>< date>

<text>I've been a car enthusiast since I was three years old.  The sales and service experience at a dealership matters to me, which is why my wife and I have purchased our last three 911s from Circle Porsche including a 2010 Turbo, 2015 Turbo S and 2018 GT3. The dealership is about 25 miles from our home and although there is a nearby Porsche dealer less than three miles away, traveling to Long Beach is a no-brainer for us.
At Circle Porsche, it's not just about selling vehicles.  General Manager, Eric Ernst, has a team of car enthusiasts who have a passion for motorsports.   We have always been treated fairly by a staff that has shared our excitement on each 911 purchase.  Also important is the fact that their deals are highly competitive.

Whether configuring a car for himself or for stock, Eric has ordered some truly exceptional cars and SUVs.  So a visit to the dealership to look at the inventory is always a cool experience.  Currently, there is a 911R on the showroom floor and later this year, Circle Porsche will take delivery of their first 911 GT2 RS.

If you're thinking about buying a new or used Porsche, I highly recommend Circle Porsche.  If you're considering a sports car, definitely drive a Porsche.  There are three "Rs" that really matter to me: Racing pedigree, Reputation, and Reliability.  All of these contribute to vehicles that are a blast to drive under all conditions and that represent Porsche's commitment to engineering and high performance.

Finally, Eric Ernst is part of the family that owns other dealerships in the area.  There aren't many family-owned dealerships anymore and a trip to Circle Porsche will make it apparent why the difference between their dealership and others owned by conglomerates is totally in the customer's best interests.

Happy Shopping and Enjoy Your Next Vehicle!< /text><resp>None< /resp>< date>

<review>I was in the market for a Porsche Macan. TrueCar directed me to Circle Porsche Long Beach for my TrueCar offer. Chris Mcgregor helped me out. We test drove a Macan base and looked at several colors and options. They end up trading the color and interior I wanted from another dealer. The general manager Eric helped me getting the car I want from another dealer, he was really nice! I love the experience I had there, Chris was an amazing sales person and went through every detail of the car. Most importantly, my Macan is so amazing, I definitely suggest coming here for your next Porsche.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Flew out from Dallas to LA on a day trip and Bought a $110k car from them, experience below

Cons -
- Rafael, one of their Manager, made me feel like he was doing me a favor by letting me spend $110k
- Asked for 2 things for the car, the missing floor mats and a temp license so i can drive it until i get my official License plate. Didn't get either one on arrival of car to Dallas
- Made us sign some documents on arrival in LA as expected. Next day emailed us that they were done wrong. You need to print, have them notorized and fedex them for next day.

Pros -
- Michael from Finance and David from Sales. Very nice and courteous

Recommend dealing with Eric, the manager. He was nice on the phone and in person. Still waiting on my mats, glad i made them put it in the contract or i would never see them.<//review>

{'time': 1390846871587, 'text': 'Omar, thank you for taking the time to write your review. I apologize that your experience was not to your satisfaction.  After speaking to our team, I learned that the floor mats were ordered for you at your initial request.  Unfortunately, the mats are backordered at Porsche and could not make it to you right away.  They will be shipped to you as soon as they are back in stock.  I am sure that David had communicated that with you as well.  Also, I am sorry for any confusion in regards to the paperwork.  Michael, our Finance Manager, is new and still in the training process.  In regards to your request for a temporary license, there are no temporary plates or licenses in California.  That’s something that would have to be taken care of at your local DMV since we cannot provide a temporary license for Texas.  Again, I apologize for any inconvenience and hope that you enjoy your Porsche.'}</resp>

<Review>I saw Circle Porsches offers on Facebook and decided to come by. I was greeted by David Farnel. He was very nice and knew a lot about the Panamera I am checking out. Thank you!< /Review>< username>

<Review>I came here looking to buy my first porsche, I was on a budget and was looking at the less expensive boxster or a used Porsche. The sales guy I talked to looked down his nose at me like I wasn't rich enough to buy his cars. Worst car buying experience I ever had, its attitudes like that that give other Porsche owners a snooty stereotype.<//Review>< Pics>

Parts department are a bunch of clowns went to pick up special ordered  parts they tried to nail me for full list instead of wholesale discount because thier system threw out my wholesale account. I asked for a wholesale taxable because I didn't have my resale number on hand & it was already my second round trip out from Costa Mesa  employees were worthless female sat playing on her phone the male took close to 20 min just to find my special order. Then they wouldn't do the sale as a courtesy wanted me to make another round trip to get my resale even after I said just charge me the tax??? Lost any business from me ever as I  drove back to Costa Mesa called SSF bought the exact same Porsche factory parts for $107.36 less. Really ridiculous on thier part time not do a courtesy sale the still would've made a very good profit off me but their greed & horrible customer service has caused me to never do business with them again. Business 101 keep customers happy!!! They failed!!!!<//Review>

<Text>Came in for 20 minutes and no one ecknowleged us it was like we were invisable. There was about five people there who all looked like they could help but instead were just on computers while we were just walking around looking at the cars right In front of them and they knew we were there however they did not care. We told the worker (don't know any names) and argued with us saying he said "how are you doing" (which he did) however right after that he went back to talking to another worker about someone complaining saying they were mislead while buying a Porsche (I don't know if that would make me want to buy one and he was just yelling and I had to drive 20 minutes to the other one. Worst experience ever.!!!!👎👎👎< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>So stoked! I have been here three times. The first time I was there to see a pre owned 911, but the car sold before I got there. I went back a few weeks later because I saw a very nice low mileage 2012 MBZ E63 Wagon. I was hesitant, because I didn't want to get beat up on my trade ('07 Z06 Corvette). I met with Joe Grimaldi who very graciously let me look the car over (he moved it into the shade and left me and my wife alone) at my leisure.
Joe followed up with me a few days later. He said that the car was still available, and that they hosting a special event on Saturday. I returned, with my trade to drive the E63. after a test drive and some simple and painless negotiation, I was the proud new owner of the E63.
Thanks to Joe and Rafael Borenstein for taking good care of us and being respectful of our time. Can't recommend them enough! There are other dealerships in the greater LA area, but this is the store that works hard to meet your needs.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I’ve been wild about cars since I was three with a passion fueled in my college years as an SCCA volunteer at Watkins Glen where I watched Mark Donahue and George Follmer wrestle Porsche 917s around the track in the Can Am series and club racers in their 911s in SCCA class races.  It matters where I buy my cars and I’m writing this review as an enthusiast and a very satisfied customer of Circle Porsche in Long Beach.

My wife and I recently ordered a new 911 and as with our previous purchase from Eric Ernst at the dealership, it was a terrific experience.  Even though I consider myself knowledgeable about 911 options, Eric advised us on some take-aways and some add-ons that resulted in a much better car - and the MSRP was lower!

That’s what’s unique about Circle Porsche – it’s all about enthusiasts not just profit.  A visit to the showroom is a cool experience just to see their sports cars, sedans and SUVs.  GTS and Turbo nameplates abound and Circle Porsche has received its third 918 one of which will be in the showroom for a few months prior to sale.  (Check out YouTube for the Porsche video on the record breaking lap at Nürburgring.)  Virtually every premium automobile dealership is within two to five miles of my home, but the 25-mile ride to Circle Porsche is worth it.  As a fellow car enthusiast pointed out, the Ernst family dealerships in Long Beach are among the few remaining family-owned automobile businesses in the U.S. that have remained independent of a corporate buy-out.  That will be obvious if you visit Circle Porsche.  Great Cars, Great People.  Have Fun!<//Text>< pictures>

Great Korean restaurant and great owners! Food was absolutely delicious and fresh. Employees were super friendly and made sure that we were completely satisfied. Serves mostly Korean-speaking customers but they can speak English!

We ordered the "황제해물탕" which is a HUGE tray of a variety of seafood and vegetables including lobsters, squids, shrimps, clams, mussels, octopus, etc, in a broth. We had 4 people and couldn't finish it.

Comes with complimentary Korean side dishes, japchae, and Korean pancake.

Definitely recommend!</text>

This place is awesome. You can get so many stuff for about $20-30 depending on what kind of combo you choose. Their service is super nice. I definitely come here again.< /Review>

Fresh seafood over 30 miles from the sea? Yup! This place hides in the corner of Golden Spring and Brea Canyon Road. You'd miss it if you are not looking for it. Did't really know what we ordered, but it was HUGE platter of fresh seafood. This may not be for those who faint at the site of blood, but some of them were still moving; that's how fresh it is. Similar type of Korean seafood dining was seen on Youtube in New York. But this is definitely a first time seeing this type of offering on the west coast. Excellent eats and will be back for more. Thank you!<//text>

Worst service. Only half the food ever made it out the kitchen. The place is understaffed and the tables were dirty from the previous diners which the waitress only wiped once before she walked away to not be seen for 20 minutes. Food was not good and the fish didn't seem fresh. I will never go here again.< /Review>

The owner and server are very rude and unfriendly. Slow service. And their food is not just bad but gave uncooked food. Didn't even apologize for that. Don't go.</text>

You must check your bill before you pay. I have feeling that I got almost ripped off. This restaurant is very weird.
How tasteless it is.........< /text>

(Translated by Google) Used to be very good but service seems to be changed under new ownership. I ordered by waitress recommendation but as a result, I felt ripoffed.

The feeling of being changed by the owner and changed a lot. I heard the waitress and ordered it. Customers are fed up with very small details.

주인바뀌고 뭔가 많이 바뀐느낌. 웨이트레스 말듣고 주문하고선 기분상해서 왔네요. 고객들은 아주 사소한 작은것에 삐진답니다.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The owner changed and they also did seafood such as grilled clams, so I went with an expectation, but it took more than 30 minutes for the shellfish to come out, and it gave me a little bit of charcoal, so the fire was so weak that I asked for more fire. If I didn't even call the server as well as the boss, I couldn't stop by once at the table to eat. And this time I ate steamed agu, but I complied because I didn't have any flesh, so I had to cook it with extra meat. I didn't know it wasn't ripe, and I ate it again with the bitter water I used to eat, and when the boss asked me to listen to something like this, he asked me if he had something like this. I just threw away the money. section
Don't go. There is no taste and service is not good. It was a pity that I often went to before I changed my owner. I do n’t like even one star. Just don't go.

주인분이 바뀌고 조개구이 등 해산물도 하신다 하셔서 기대하는 마음으로 갔는데 조개가 나오는데만 30분 넘게 걸리고 숯불도 조금만 줘서 불이 너무 약해 불 좀 더 달라고했더니 사장님이 알겠다고만 하시고 가져다주시지도 않고 조개를 내오기만하고 사장은 물론이고 서버 조차도 부르지않으면 테이블에 한번을 안들려서 먹는데 너무 불편했어요. 그리고 이번에 아구찜도 먹었는데 살이 하나 없어 컴플레인했더니 살을 따로 넣어서 요리했어야했는데 실수로 안한거같다고 하더니 살만 드리겠다고 하더니 정말 소스하나 없이 살만 대충 데쳐서 가지고 나오셨는데 심지어 익지도 않았었습니다. 안익은줄 모르고 한입 베어먹는데 쓴 물과 함께 차가워서 다시 말씀드렸더니 사장이 들으라는식으로 뭐 이런거가지고 그러냐고 하더니 그뒤로 죄송하다는 말은 커녕 테이블에 한번을 안들리시더라구요. 돈만 버렸습니다. 절
대 가지마세요. 맛도 없고 서비스도 별로입니다. 주인 바뀌기 전에는 자주 가던 곳인데 안타깝네요. 별 하나도 아까워요. 그냥 가지마세요.</review>

<Date>1498843895571<//Date><Rate>3</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) It wasn't long before the Japanese food was opened, so we went to eat fish, but I'm a little disappointed that it starts at 5 PM.
Then you can't eat at lunchtime .. ??
I hope that there will be a lot of customers so you can eat it for lunch.

일식 오픈한지 얼마 안돼서 인지 우리는 생선을 먹으러 갔는데 오후 5시부터 한다니까 좀 실망.
그럼 점심시간때는 먹지 못하는건가요..??
손님들이 많아져서 점심에도 먹을수 있기를.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>It's a very large park with tons of trees and lots of ducks. They also have some very interesting placement of art around the center of the park. It's a very nice place to just sit on a bench relax under a tree or bring your kids over to ride the bikes around the park. I would definitely come here to relax on a Sunday.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT8UAhQIeQZlA8Y0ZRlOXIjwvRIY5Z_yEUu_f_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGNAaKQKqDBh-BOZvemLiJJ4UlZi3eippwNbUt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzlKSHP1s23upEGmq9tNV5uU7NsEpA15fsA5zZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW_ingXMdyGYODTfBNgkodIfKKNW23dmKNJZ32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmIrcUoM3rn6OjtPYFmgEcnpewTh3guTV9-2kl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOneNOEdoREwxbCHUIr20Fse0Ihpbhj6tXJ3edY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRkbi_WW1LCLqNg-Hs9wG1m_G1-SiTcdsMi1_X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

This is an example of how to do a great small skatepark.  It's simple, but perfectly designed - a nice snake-ish run with good little street features entering and exiting, a few easy staircases being ripped by locals.  Not intimidating, but still lots of potential to get gnarly.<//Text>

I called looking for help about something I knew absolutely nothing about and got all of the answers I needed and more.

We live in Santa Clarita and my son went out to San Bernardino and unfortunately he got arrested. I was worried that I couldn't bail him out because I was so far away. I called Absolute spoke to a guy name Marco and he arrange it so it would work for me so I wouldn't have to drive up there. Very nice man and cared that I was worried. Made my experience at ease with a great price.</text>

<Review>I was in need of a BB for a family member. I decided to use Absolute Bail Bonds and I do not regret it! Marco took great care of me! He was very understanding, polite and very knowledgeable. It made me feel at ease. They have different payment options depending on your situation. I was able to get my family member back home in no time! Thank you Absolute!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Absolutely great service! They were beyond helpful and honest in explaining the bail and financial process step by step. It was helpful that our agent Marco was bilingual and knew the bail process inside and out which eased our worries. It was a quick and easy process, thank you. I would definitely recommend their services!<//Review>< Pics>

The service was great, Marco really helped us out. He literally explained every detail about the process. I hadn't done this before so when you have someone leading the way it REALLY HELPS OUT. Fyi he was able to set us up with a discount. I cannot express how much gratitude i have towards this company. Thank you so much Marco and Absolute!!

PS: Also, When I went on their website and found useful information, about laws and child safety. I found it really interesting that a bail bond company was giving information on knowing your rights and family care. I added the picture that caught my attention to the article about Keeping kids safe in the water. Keep up the good work!<//text>

<text>We had a party this weekend and ended up having to bail out my brother inlaw. Well we have never done this before so we really didnt know what to expect. Marco was really informational!! He was also very friendly, he treated us like regular folks. I called this other place and they seemed to be having a bad day, so when Marco answered at this place it was a go. Thanks Marco, we really apprecitae your service man. Glad to see there is still people who care about the customer.< /text>< Pictures>

My daughter in law was arrested, and we used absolute bail bonds to bail her out. The whole experience, beside the fact that she was arrested, was good. They were able to explian the process very detailed. When i called they found her in the system right away. I love the fact that they were able to do everything over the phone. The agent even reccomended a place to eat since we weren't familiar with the area. Very happy with the overall service! Worth checking out....fyi ask about the discounts they offer.< /text>

Love this movie theater. The food is delicious and served to you before the movie starts. There's enough room to relax and watch the movie. I would suggest you get there early to ensure you get a comfy chair. The place fills in quickly. There's a nice wine bar inside and they allow you to bring the wine into the theater. Staff is always friendly and helpful.< /review>

Not bad for a neighborhood movie theater that serves restaurant quality food, [which is actually pretty good.] But, for their prices, it would be nice if fries came with the chicken prosciutto sandwich I ordered. They also have no drink fountain as far as I was told. Therefore the soft drinks I ordered were specialty soft drinks made by some company I never heard of. Again great tasting but more than I bargained for price-wise.< /Text>

What a beautiful surprise ! We went twice and were happy to see we could watch a movie seated on a couch, with a convenient table to put our drinks and food on. It’s a small and local theater, I love to support places like this. From what I know, there are 2 movie rooms, one upstairs, one downstairs.

Ps: Sooner you go and more chances you have to be where you want to be.< /Text>

<Review>Fun atmosphere.  The seats have small tables interspersed so you have a place for your snacks... next time I'll try pizza. The nachos are hard to eat in the dark- you never know when you'll get a bunch of jalapenos. Also messy. The grilled cheese was not to my taste -- bread too thick and dry and maybe stale. Anyway, had a fun time.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The itself theater is great and the food is good, especially for a movie theater/restaurant combination. I had a hamburger at my last visit that was served quickly and met my expectations, and I've never had a problem with service or with the food I've eaten there.

I've often seen opening day movies and it's great fun to have food, a drink, and a movie at the same time. It's a great spot for a date or time with a good friend. It's pretty intimate, especially if you're eating while watching the movie, so it might not be perfect for a large group. That's probably part of why I like it so much.< /review>

<Review>Comfortable seating. They show the newest movies. The food is quality because they have cooks in the kitchen not just movie theatre food. They have a nice wine bar that has even more food options and of course you can always go to the bar without a movie just to have a drink.< /Review>< rate>

<review>I enjoy the adult atmosphere it's more like a speakeasy than a regular theater. They serve alcoholic beverages and light meals (salads, nachos, chicken wings etc) with individual tables and chairs. The service is fast and friendly and afterwards if you're still hungry there are ample places to dine nearby.</review><user>107300330873670201541<//user><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

The seats are comfortable, the employees are always friendly and helpful, and the food is surprisingly good!  I love the selection of beers on tap too. It's the best place around to see first run movies in a great atmosphere. I always go with a group of friends - we can eat out and see a movie at the same time. What could be better!< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Foods always delicious - movie quality is always great. Satisfied every time i leave this theater. Glad i got to see opening night of Black Panther here. We had to buy tickets way in advance because it was the early release shows - i suggest others do the same if the movie is highly popular and within its first few weeks of release. Get there early if you want a good seat, its worth it, plus you usually get your food before the lights turn off - which I prefer. Staff is friendly and helpful, the woman at the bar is awesome!</text>< Pics>

We love seeing movies at this theater: wide screens, sound doesn't overwhelm,  comfortable seats, wine bar/lounge (when open). On the delta side: they need to have more employees present especially when the more popular movies are showing. The last few times we went, there were fewer than four employees to handle the crowds. No bueno; please fix this.<//Review>

<review>Top tier service, good food, nice location, but I can't justify 5 stars because there is only street parking, some of the seating is kind of aged. however their tater tots are really good, the burger has very fresh meat, the super nachos are a classic, and they serve alcohol, including whole bottles of wine. Sometimes it is a little packed, and sometimes the line is a little long, but if you ever drive by and it seems empty, take the opportunity, you won't regret it.<//review><resp>None</resp>< user_name>

<text>Literally a historical landmark with a friendly   small family  vibe where people can  actually comfortably enjoy the entertainment of the cinematic experience they came to see. Ran by a group of all differently interesting  personalites so insync with eachother that they effortlessly seem to manage and maintain ship to provide you the smooth stress free  experience you expect to have on an special outing event like going out to the Movie theater used to and should still be. Their kitchen staff offers and skillfully provides an interesting array of food choices prepared with many varieties of classic and rarely used luxury ingridents cooked to delicious downhome perfection. The quaint cozy little side  Bar area called The Scene has a classic relaxing fancy lounge atmosphere, with wine options served in real stemware. Most usually bar is tended by a distintly uniqe guy that gives the place a slight OG sportsbar edge as he draws you a nice full pint of different draft or lauger beers of choice. The scene menu even offers a small  array of thoughtfully  unique d'oeuvres like ricotta stuffed mushrooms  or sauteed brussell sprots with prosciutto. So regardless if your alone, on a date  or with family, the Rialto Cinemas is fun for all.</text>< name>

Small but great hometown-y feel-y movie theater.  Great price and they accept movie pass if you’ve joined that cult.  Their food is good and decently priced and I really enjoy the sofas in the front.  The staff is excellent!</Text>

Love this local theatre venue, would take this over AMC and Century. Much quieter, less rowdy crowds when it gets packed compared to chains like Century Hilltop. Although, there's usually only 2 movies in play, it's worth it for the prices and the spacious seating. Great for families. There's also restaurant quality food and beverages as well.< /Review>

<time>1517273473303< /time><rate>5< /rate><review>They only show two movies at a time, but they have some fun special screening nights too.  The best thing about this place is that you can spread out on a couch and order food to eat and they'll bring it to you during the movie.  The food prices are a bit on the pricey side, but it's all tasted amazing to me.  They have things from hummus plates, tots, pizza, and burgers, popcorn and a bunch of popcorn toppings available.  They also serve alcohol.  It's a comfy environment, I love coming here. :)</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I love going to this theater when visiting family nearby. It is clean, the staff is friendly, the food is good and served hot (had the pizza this last visit) and the lounge atmosphere is great. I have always had a good view of the big screen while feeling very much at home.< /Text>< Pics>

Clean up worker at the end of “Once upon a time in LA “  on 7/26/19 4:15pm Friday. Knocked off 2 stars from a 5 star first time experience. I liked the seating and overall vibe from this theater and was really excited to see the movie. Therefore after discussing the movie with a friend..roughly 2min after the move ended the clean up guy says....guys movies over!!! In a rude tone with a smirk on his face.  Hey man if you don’t like your job and you feel like being a jerk, work somewhere else. Note to management, I had a great time but you should check that guy, shouldn’t be hard to figure out with his negative performance regarding decent customer service.

- Thank you otherwise< /Review>

<Text>I ordered some nachos and they had so cheese on them I asked for my money back. Unfortunately, it was the last movie of the night and they had closed their register 30 minutes after the movie began. The manager said she couldn't give me a refund and offered me candy from the display case and said that was all she could be because the register was already closed. I informed her I was a diabetic and could not eat the candy from the display. I asked for their corporate office, contact person and her name. Only then did she offer me two free movie passes. I told her I was satisfied with the free passes and didn't need to contact their corporate office but took the information anyway. I tried to use the tickets when Thor: Ragnarok came out and was informed by Carl that I could only use the ticket approximately 3-4 weeks after the movie came out. It was very frustrating to say the least. I still have the movie tickets and now I can't use them to see the Black Panther movie. This is some of the most horrible customer service I have experienced in a long time.</Text><Date>1519095423466< /Date><gmapID>0x808579225d754191:0x82d85371ec47f6cd</gmapID><userid>114256877891414529777<//userid>< Resp>

It's a old 2 screen theater that has couches, rolling chairs and some theater seats. It is very old school but not bad. The rolling chairs are very comfortable. They sell food and drinks, I had a pizza and tater tots and they were pretty good.</Review>

<text>Small, fun, cozy. Get in early to score a couch and/or grab a drink or food. They have regular seats and dinner tables behind the couches. Beer, wine, pizza, burgers, popcorn, ice cream. Check online for schedule and beware of bring the baby night! It actually wasn't bad the night I found myself at baby night.< /text>< rate>

This is THE place to see movies in the Bay Area and the patrons know it, every time I’ve been here the audience really gets into the experience. Food is great, service is great, atmosphere is great, seating is great, so really, why are you wasting your time reading this? Go now!<//Review>

An updated but old fashioned theater, the seats are comfortable, the food is tasty and staff are friendly. Nice to be able to have a drink and dinner with a show. And tickets best the giant multiplex. This is the place for a classy and enjoyable trip to the theater.<//Review>

We saw the avengers the other night.  Good selection of beer and the food was good. They also had really comfortable couches. What's really nice, when you order they bring your food to your table so you don't have to get up. It was a good experience.< /text>

It's because of the Rialto Theater that I no longer need to go to the big stadium theater when I want to see a movie. The loveseats are cozy, the pizza is amazing, the lemonade is made fresh and they put real butter on their popcorn!</Text>

A small two showroom theatre that shows the most popular films and past masterpieces (from time to time).

It is a spacious and accommodates a large amount of leg for a comfortable movie viewing experience.

There is a range of average "sports" bar food that can be brought in to make it an opportunity to eat and have entertainment at the same time.< /review>

I love the sofas and the couches that have tables in front of them and the swivel chairs with the tables in front of them. I dislike that they will not take any bill over $20 because they think it will be counterfeit or that they will get robbed. Their food and drinks are tasty!< /text>

This place is awesome! The theaters are comfy, with couches and soft chairs rather than standard theater seats. You can order food/drinks (including beer) and take it into the theater while you watch. The food and beer selection is surprisingly good for a little theater like this as well.

I went in once, and after the movie ended I realized that I locked my keys in my car. It was cold and rainy out, and the staff here gave me free popcorn and let me hang out while I waited for AAA to arrive. Definitely put them as a solid 5 stars after that.< /Review>

Adequate beer & food selections...vegetarians accommodated by offering numerous salad combinations and even black bean burgers. I miss the traditional sweet potatoe cut they used to offer for the fries, though.
Now they offer that waffle cut and both times I ordered them they were either over or under cooked.< /review><user>106510621930086352334</user><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Management: You had an "Incident" in your theater on Friday May 24th during the 3:30PM showing of the Avengers that you need to investigate and take corrective action on IMMEDIATELY.

You have in your employment a RAGE-MONSTER with zero people skills, and zero communication skills that yelled multiple times at an entire audience (Who by the way was non-confrontational and patient through a technical issue your business was experiencing). FIX THIS NOW.

Let me preface this by saying my family and I have been supporting our hometown theater since it opened. Yes the negative reviews are all correct about this theater being run down. This was the first show of the day and the theater was filthy and not cleaned prior to it's first showing. Soap dispensers in the bathrooms are broken and they had an empty bottle of hand soap on the counter. Floors sticky and filthy. furniture is run down and no longer comfortable.

Note to Management: You should provide a clean theater for your clientel.

In spite of this we have always returned because we want to support our local theater and have found the staff to be friendly and our visits an overall positive experience.

Until yesterday...

May 24th 3:30pm viewing of Avengers. Dropped well over 100 bucks on tickets, food & beverages. Had to go downstairs to inform the staff that there was no sound during the previews. An extremely rude and confrontational employee replied "I'll get to it in a minute". Really? No Sorry for the inconvenience, will be there shortly?

Went back to my seat. Employee fiddled about then rudely yells to the audience: "You all need to go downstairs". No details or explanation... Everyone looks at each other a bit bewildered, and proceed to go downstairs. My family and I are gathering our burger, pizza, beverages to carry downstairs and the employee yells at us  "You need to go downstairs". Um, we are... just gathering up all the food and drink we ordered to support your business.

The audience is now in the lobby wondering what the heck is going on and hear another staff member say avengers is playing in theater 1. So we all go into theater 1 and get settled. After a few moments the same rude employee comes into the theater and yells at the audience: "I told you to go downstairs, not come in here... GO UPSTAIRS". The audience is beside themselves with disbelief at the way this employees is yelling at everyone... An audience member replies "You aren't being clear in your communication", in which the employee replies: "You don't gotta be here if you don't wanta be here, you can leave".  He is aggressive, angry, and confrontational...Yelling Multiple times to the audience as they are moving back upstairs "You don't gotta be here - you can go home".

Never seen anything like this EVER. Will not be back until that guy is GONE. What the hell was he thinking? You don't speak to an entire audience of paying customers like that. Hey Rage-Monster... YOU DON'T GOTTA BE HERE...YOU SHOULD GO HOME.<//review>

Plenty of eating while watching the movie. They forgot to bring my food. Came back several months later to see Lion King. The upholstered chairs need to be shampooed. The carpet needs to be cleaned. The theatre needs to be disinfected.</review>

Let's be honest for a moment: you can sit down, on a couch, watch a (new!) movie, and drink beer, and eat a pizza.

If the movie you want to watch is here, why would you go anywhere else?

Note: There is limited couch space, so arrive on time if you want to sit on the couches.<//Text>

Presentation is nothing special and feels a bit dated, but everything else here is fantastic. Food is a bit pricy but totally worth it, popcorn is fresh, and couch seating is so nice when you have someone to sit with. Even the theater seats in the back are comfy and give a great view of the screen. Love coming here!< /Review>

Love this movie theater.  Comfy couches, beer on tap and surprisingly good food.  This is our go-to for any films in the area.< /review>

The best movie theater in the East Bay. A very comfortable theater with great food served by an excellent staff who are friendly and helpful. A great theater for families or "creepy old guys" like me who just wanna sit and watch a movie without being surrounded by disrespectful teens and twenty something's chatting away and playing games on their phones the whole time - all those kiddies paid extra ($23.00 per ticket now - 3 times the matinee price of this place) ) to go to the overpriced, overblown, over crowded, over-hyped Metrion in S.F.  So, if you're a grown up who enjoys being able to have a pleasant movie going experience with a friend for under $20 instead of $50 and up, this is the theater for you.<//Text>

Homey theatre. Couches are stained and uncomfortably sagging. Otherwise a nice venue.</text>

< review>
Part of the new-school old school movement in personal service and food friendly theaters, (See my review of Alameda theaters) this local spot, boasts multi theaters, and live national drama plays, as well as an eclectic selection of movies and great staff. Note: Beware their online ticket purchase page. It has major flaws and sometimes will decline a working credit or debit, and yet still charge your bank. Call them before ordering to check it's status.< /review>

It's a theater style movie theater, so you will have table inside to put your food. Good movie theater, but don't expect to find a recline seat or a luxury lounge inside.</Review>

It's good environment and I like what they offer (food, drinks, alcoholic beverages). It's a little pricey if you eat there though, and not all food options are delicious and worth the price.< /text>

(Translated by Google) First time I visit this place, it's very nice to watch movies and eat some pizzas because it has small tables in the same room 👏👏

<text>(Translated by Google) Dinner watching your movie. There are only two rooms, but one of them is decorated like a theater and the seats are comfortable. Dinner took a long time to serve but it was of good quality. The entrance is a bit expensive.
