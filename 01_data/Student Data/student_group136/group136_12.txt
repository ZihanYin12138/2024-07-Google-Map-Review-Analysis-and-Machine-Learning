I loved Dr Lizette! Honestly, she was 5 stars. The lost star was having to wait 30 minutes for my scheduled appointment. It wouldn’t have been a big deal but I was on my lunch hour and the delay made me late getting back.  The ladies at the office were lovely as well! I will definitely be coming back to Dr Lizette for future exams!<//review>

The staff was very friendly while taking every safety protocol in regards to the Covid pandemic. They explained my options for the eyewear I seriously needed. The optometrist explained everything that I was being tested for while sharing the results in detail. An overall pleasant experience. Would definitely continue to use for my optical needs.< /text>

Everyone from the front office to the doctor in the back office was awesome! Super friendly and thoughtful. Although I wish Target would put a little waiting area outside of the area for other people bc I saw two elderly people waiting without chairs since they could only allow a few people into the space at a time.< /review>

The doctor was absolutely amazing, she was kind and took the time to really listen to me. The woman who helped me in the optical side of the store was just as amazing and I genuinely enjoyed talking with her. The staff is fantastic and I will be back and continue to use this location for my glasses and contacts.
They kept the store very clean and sanitized everything during my visits. With the Covid craziness going on, it was nice to know they cared for my safety as well as theirs and they made a point to show me and tell me things were disinfected. It made my visit a lot less stressful.

Thank you ladies, I appreciate you!< /Review>

Emily was my doctor and she was kind and informative.  She didn't judge me or make me feel bad if I didn't take care of my eyes properly. (Some doctors will reprimand you almost if you sleep in your contacts a few times. Like I get it tell me I shouldn't do it, but don't have to scold me.) The woman at the front who did the "administrative" work was amazing, a one-woman show running the place. Handling walk-in customers, customers buying glasses, and guests with appointments.<//review>

There service is great. The Dr was very kind and sweet but efficient and took the time to explain in detail what she was doing and why. Also EXTREMELY
optimistic. There were two women in the lobby area where you pick the glasses that immediately and happily went to help us. Me and my wife were actually arguing to an extent, and they not only pretended that they weren't there, they didnt act any type of way as soon as we got on the same page they were happy to proceed and consistently professional and polite. They smiled and didnt mind describing every lens and frame, they didn't make us feel pressured at all. They werent trying to rush us, and they took the time to make sure we found exactly what we wanted. This is a very good office, they made me feel the actually gave a real d*** about me.</Review>

< Review>
Van Nuys Vision Optometry is located inside the Target on Sepulveda. A bit hard to find in the store, but it is on the first floor, int he corner close to the pharmacy. There are a few doctors here that I have had a chance to meet. Dr. Husain, Dr. Coffee, and Dr. De Ramos. They are all amazing! I got a comprehensive eye exam, and a contact lenses fitting done. They even taught me how to put on my contacts and the care of them. The team of Target Optical is also amazing. They take their time to help you pick out glasses. They also have amazing deals, so I saved a bunch of money by getting contacts and glasses!!<//Review>

My recent eye exam was a very good experience.  Dr. Magno is kind and efficient and knowledgeable.  It was a pleasure to be his patient and feel confident that he is taking good care of my eyes.</Review>

I can't say enough good things about my experience with StorageMart. Anastasia, the manager, was always the perfect mix of professionalism and personality. She explained the lease in detail and got me moved in quickly. Whenever I saw her on the property she was upbeat and helpful. I definitely recommend StorageMart and especially the one in Morgan Hill.< /text>

The front manager is very fake and unprofessional. My boyfriend had to move a toolbox out of our unit because we are moving into our place and we're trying to get our stuff out, but couldn't do it by himself because the box was too big to fit into either of our cars so he needed help and was going to have the guy that moved it for us come get it while he was there not realizing he would have to wait a few hours for the guy to come.  Apparently that's ground for termination and apparent she already told him this but never once said anything to me about it even though it's my unit with my name on it. Being unreasonable with the fact that we couldn't move the toolbox ourselves with out help. She acts like she an understanding person when you're signing up and then changes tone after you're already renting. As soon as I called I got instant attitude from her about it instead of actually just telling me what's up when this is the first time I'm hearing anything from her about this issue.< /Review>

< Review>
Just booked with them and then immediately had them give me a refund.  They roped me in with a 50% off promotion.  Then told me my rate would double sometime after 3 months.  They don't know when.  How does a company not know when they are going to double your rate.  Very shady and I cancelled and requested a refund immediately on the same call.  They kept saying if they cancel I won't get that low rate again.  I told them I'd rather pay more and not be surprised with double bills in the very near future.  Hopefully my refund goes smoothly.  I reserved and cancelled all in the same call.<//Review>

Really easy,  and I needed 24 hour access due to work and it was no problem. The best part was how easy it was.  The cost is a little higher then I want to pay, but it's worth it.   My unit seems to have a harder to roll up door then most I have used in the past, but overall its been my ONLY negative.   Place is clean,  easy to get to and little traffic in the area.</Text>

<text>Fantastic team and a great location.  I was always impressed with the facilities security and the cleanliness of the property.  If you're anything like me, you want to know your valuables are safe from theft and any sort of infestation or ruin.  I felt very good about my time at StorageMart.

I really enjoyed working with Georgette (the local manager) and felt like she truly valued my business.  She was always friendly, courteous and extremely professional.  The only reason I left was due to a move.  Do yourself a favor and check out StorageMart in Morgan Hill.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Horrible facility! I happened to have been experiencing some financial hardships upon losing my job as well as my Mom and Grandpa passing and was unable to cover the almost $150/mo rent on the small unit my belongings occupied with this establishment. While I continued to receive the billing statements including the insurance I opted into and a late fee that that increased from June to July and increased yet again from July to Aug, I NEVER NOT EVEN ONCE received nor was I sent a notice stating a lock was being placed on my unit and I would be charged a Over-Lock Service fee (common sense, yes I know) however, I'm none the less legally entitled to be notified of this action, in which I was not. Nor was I notified (13 days later) that the facility would be cutting said lock for the purpose of gaining access to my unit to conduct inventory of my belongings, and of course billing me almost $100 to do so. I was not notified yet again, 15 days after they accessed my unit that they had put a advertisement for the sale of my unit, of course billing me yet again nearly $100 to do so. STILL NO TYPE OF NOTIFICATION OF ANY OF THESE ACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF, YET STILL MANAGING TO EMAIL MY BILLING STATEMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER OF COURSE. Less than 2 weeks after the advertisement my unit was being scheduled for auction (it was then, that precise day Fri Aug 23rd 3:30 in the afternoon) I received a call from the facility stating my unit was going to be auctioned off Mon Aug 26th @ 4oclock (did I mention the auction scheduling fee I was billed of yet again, close to $100? ) after explaining to the gentleman the what the past few months had entailed and that my Moms (who I lossed what will be a very short year ago come this Sept 11th) belongings were in this storage and I couldn't loose these items!!  I was given the opportunity to come in on Mon Aug 26th the day of the auction by 4pm with $400 and I would have until close of their office hours (6pm) to have the entirety of this unit removed. Worried I would be late (coming from San Jose in traffic) I called (approx. 3:30ish) the same young man I spoke with on Fri to ensure him I was indeed on the way and I had the amount we agreed upon, only to be told that they had auctioned off my Mom's things!! Imagine losing all you had left (tangible, that is) of your Mom! Correct me if I'm wrong, is a verbal agreement not legally binding? I was told that because the individual who purchased my unit had not yet paid for it that they would let us know if said party failed to come remove my items and pay for the unit they would let me know and we could then go down with $400 of course and clear out our items. The only good thing about all this is that I didn't loose my Mom's belongings and I couldn't be more thankful for that of course! However, during the less than hour and a half we were given to vacate the unit I spoke with a tenant that in conversation mentioned she had been at the facility ALL day and there was no auction conducted at all at any part of the day! I'll have to look into the advertisement that was posted because unless it was a online auction, I was lied to and my unit was never auctioned off in the first place! I can't help but feel emotionally, mentally and physically exhausted from this whole ordeal! Truly considering contacting my grandmothers lawyer in regards to this matter.
TAKE YOUR POSSESSIONS ELSEWHERE! THERE ARE A PLETHORA OF OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO SELF-STORAGE AND AT MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE RATES THATS FOR SURE!!!! Not to mention, I am unaware of any auction online or on-site that you have "pay later" option? I was of the mind that once a unit is sold,  payment is due upon purchase?< /text>

At StorageMart, it is never our intention to auction any customer's belongings and we do provide great options to help avoid any loss. While we try our best to be as transparent as possible by listing our policies in the lease agreement, we do apologize that we did not do a great job of communicating with you about this process.

< Review>
The latch mechanisms are so cheap, theives can break those more easily than the lock.  My girlfriends locker was broken into, the lock was fine, they dont have cameras except on the front entrances, and the manager tried to tell us it was my girlfriends fault because she didnt come by to inspect her long term storage locker recently.  If you are looking for decently secure storage, go some place else.</Review>

I arrived on a Sunday, exhausted and confused about which unit was mine. Miguel Alvarez did a beautiful job in helping me out, keeping me calm and turning a potentially terrible experience to a happy positive one. Customer service at Storage Mart is a 5 Star experience. Thank you Miguel and your supervisor Georgette.<//Text>

<text>Very unhappy with the service. I'd never recommend this company to anyone as soon as i find a place to move my stuff into i will be moving my stuff out. The Store Manager and district Manager are very unprofessional. My unit was drenched in water back in November on Thanksgiving day.  And it took 6 months to reimburse me and only gave me half of what my paperwork says.< /text>< date>

<Review>Went with my mother to pay the storeage bill. Sign on door said, running an errand. Be back in 20 minutes. We waited for 2 hours, for worker to get back. She blamed it on the owner. Not my storage, I wouldn't use them to store my belongings.</Review>< pics>

< review>
I've only really worked with Bredan. He is very helpful with everything that I've ever needed. I only met Georgetta today but she seemed very pleasant. The only downfall of this storage facility is that you can't get into the gates after 7 pm and the outside doors are always open so there's no telling if mice or bugs are getting into your storage. I haven't seen any droppings but I did find a few daddy long legs. I accidently locked myself out of the gates with some stuff outside of my storage. The grounds and storage unit are very clean, my storage unit is carpeted which I really like.  All in all great customer service a little pricy but well worth it for hvac climate control.</review>

<review>Very pressed with overall operation. "Toni" is an attentive, personable server. She anticipates your wants before you ask, and is the kind of person you would like to have join you for the meal. Excellent variety for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Consistent quality prep and service. House wines of good quality, mimosas, all low priced, lattes are hot and rich in flavor. E-Club deals are super inviting.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

As expected of Mimi's.
I prefer this place for American breakfast. Whatever you order, make sure to get their famous bran. This place closed, but if you like Mimi’s, they have another one on Foothill.</Review>

This restaurant has a good but crowded atmosphere. The prices are a bit high, but the food is always excellent no matter what dish you choose. My favorite is something they recently took off the menu: cinnamon raisin French toast... Bummer!< /Text>

After we ordered our food, we felt completely forgotten or abandoned. Customers at a nearby table waited long enough that they asked to talk to the restaurant manager.  No one (manager or waitress) came talk to us while we were waiting. No bread either.  The restaurant wasn't even crowded at all.  It was only 40-50% full that day.  I will not go visit them anymore.</text>< Pictures>

Never offered the bread basket. I ordered an avocado burger and there wasn't any avocado on it just a very very thin layer of avocado. Asked to have my order change due to disappointment and dissatisfaction. Now I'm watching my mother in-law enjoy her food while I wait. Was never offered an apology . never coming here again<//Review>

My wife and I went for dinner last night, Jan. 14, and will not be going back again. Ordered a beer, it 'expired' in Aug. 2016, ordered roasted chicken- did not look anything like the photo because it was undercook - asked  server (Brian) to speak to the Mgr. and was told she was busy. He never asked if I wanted anything else to drink when I told him about the old beer. Place not very busy for a Saturday evening and I totally understand why after this experience !!</Text>

The service is horrible. They took forever to place our order and to check on us throughout the meal to make sure we didn't need anything. Food came out cold twice and no manager ever came to the table to acknowledge us.<//text>

We haven't been to Mimi's for a couple of years because we were disappointed in the new menu and gave up on it, but we got a gift card and decided to try it again. Wish they'd change the name cause it certainly isn't Mimi's anymore. Won't be back!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Went there for brunch and was greeted very nicely. Got my order placed and  began to fill my drink from the fountain. When I finished I noticed my first problem. Something, looking like small bits of mold, were floating in my drink. My guess is that they didn't clean the ice machine too often. Second was my order. I got a chicken plate to share with my sister at my house, but when I got home to share the order, the chicken was extremely spicy. Now I can handle the spice but I definitely wasn't expecting it. Overall the ladies working there were extremely nice and I thanked them for the time to make the meal, but I wish they were a little more attentive. My suggestion is to double check your food and drink before leaving.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I really like this place as a quick work lunch spot. They always make my food in under five minutes, normally quicker. The chicken is always hot. I get the regular bowl with rice and veggies and then put double hot sauce and yummy sauce on.

$8 and I'm full and I feel healthy after I eat it.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd9cf51377dc9:0x58abf43fa2c69763<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It was empty for a reason. The fish tacos next door looks more appealing than this place. They really need to adjust the pricing. The quality of the food is like any other place, just the price dosesnt match the food they give you.</review><user_name>Ma La</user_name><userid>115962576588406199838</userid>< resp>

<Text>I give them 3 stars for the simple fact that I have to ask to have my meat and chicken well cooked every time I visit. The first time I asked to have the meat well cooked, the younger cook made an arrogant comment! If it was not for Arlene and Karen's customer service I would never go here. They deserve a raise.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd9cf51377dc9:0x58abf43fa2c69763<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My mother is currently a patient here. I had to drop off some things for her and was so pleased to see how clean and neat everything was.  The staff were especially kind and helpful. Plenty of parking and easy to find.  Wouldn't want her anywhere else.</Review>

If I could give ZERO stars I would. Terrible customer service - they make it seem as though money is all they care about.

My first experience was in the physical therapy ward. Although I had 2 sessions a week for 2 months (over 16 sessions), I dealt and met with the doctor ONE time. He did not give me the time of day. The PAs were helpful but still gave very little personal attention.

My second (and last) experience was in the surgical operations ward. I was told I would receive phone calls about pre-op Covid test, pre-op patient information interview, and a final call as to my operation time. I received NONE of these calls, I had to initiate every call in order to get the information. I provided feedback to the chief of surgical operation, who passed me along to the head of Human Resources, who passed me along to the next. I finally called the CEO directly in order to inform him of the terrible experience - he brushed me off and asked “what do you want me to do about it?”. Zero empathy for someone receiving no attention from the people I am trusting to operate on me under anesthesia. The operation time finally came around, and even though I put up a major fuss about the low quality of service I had received, the operators still managed to show no regard for my experience - chipping my front tooth during the operation. Not only did they disregard my well being, they GAVE me an entirely different patients medical information, pictures, and diagnosis. Huge HIPAA violation. RIDICULOUS. After calling to inform them of the mishap, the only response from Casa Colina was a call from the head of compliance. No apologies were given to me, but she made it very clear that I signed a consent form alleviating them from any legal issues following my chipped tooth (fair point, I should’ve been more aware while signing). She also accused me of being “egregiously inhumane” for refusing to return the other patients information until they handle my situation first (their mistake, not mine). Not only have they showed zero remorse, but they harass me with phone calls accusing me of wrong doing, when in reality they didn’t care enough to check the patient information they were handing out - they only cared when they were placed in a position of dealing with legal ramifications. When I requested the chairman and vice-chairman’s contact information to inform them of this situation, the CEO blocked any employee from releasing this information to me specifically. Covering their mistakes.

Terrible facility. Terrible leadership. WOULD NOT recommend.<//text>

I recently had an out patient surgery at casa Colina in Pomona on November 9th with Dr Brady My experience was great!!! Thanks you for your patients and for always explaining everything in detail. The intake nurses were fabulous very sweet upbeat and professional. As a patient I was nervous but having nice upbeat friendly nurses made the experience a whole lot better!!! Not to mention the fact they wiped down everything very clean facilities.< /Text>

The place looks wonderful bit on a bit discouraged about not allowing outdoor visits for a therapy patient. I guess they don't have the right training to screen and manage such a simple thing. I guess the parents mental well being isn't a priority.  I will say the place looks wonderful.<//review>

My father broke his hip and his recovery was at Casa Colina.  The staff took very good care of him especially considering the additional challenges with my father having speech and heart conditions. While we hoped he could have had more time there to recover, he had to be transferred to another facility due to Medicare limitations.  The case manager at Casa Colina (Jason C.) was especially helpful and supportive in making sure this transfer went smoothly.  We appreciate and want to thank Jason and the staff at Casa Colina for their assistance in helping my father through his recovery process.<//text>

<Text>I was treated two different times in 2016 for total knee replacement. Annie was amazing and constantly encourage me to work hard for the best result while continuing to support me at my pace.

I recently found myself needing hand therapy, went against my original thoughts and went to the therapist my surgeon suggested. I was miserable yearning for the support I had previously experienced. I took a chance and tracked down the staff I worked with previously hoping for a recommendation. Of course life goes on and I didn’t expect much but thankfully both the director and the therapist still work for Casa Colina. I reached out to the director for a recommendation and Christi Ewing went far beyond that, she listened to me and my concerns and immediately got me in to see a hand therapist the next day. I had my first appointment today and left with tears in my eyes because the therapist wanted to hear about the path I had taken and assured me that she would help. I look forward to working with Mariem and can’t speak highly enough about the professionalism I experienced. Thank you Casa Colina for being diligent enough to keep your staff long term and obviously creating a team dedicated to service!< /Text><userid>106448623822602082345</userid></record>

This is heaven on earth here, the staff is caring, patient and over all AMAZING!! I'm here scared but because of the staff willingness to spend their time talking to you and explain their experiences with you I now understand what's going on I understand and am now relaxed.  I love this place and can't say enough good things about it. I would recommend all my family and friends to come here. the facility is clean and very well taken care of. Do yourself a favor and come here if you need this kind of service you will never regret it.</review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>I was at Casa Colina for two weeks for therapy after having been in a diabetic coma. This is the finest place I have experienced or even heard of as far as rehabilitation and assisted living/therapy are concerned. The medical staff is dedicated to your well being and safety and the therapy staff takes the time to not only help you do the work, but explain why they are doing it and how it will help you attain your goal of getting your life back.

Safety is the number one priority. When I first got here, I could not get out of bed on my own and had almost no stamina or strength. Two weeks later I am walking unassisted and am well on my way to being independent.

Overall, everyone is interested in seeing that patients are safe, working towards achieving their physical and even mental health to where it was before whatever happened to you.

I would HIGHLY recommend Casa Colina for your recovery/therapy needs. There tends to be a waiting list to get in here and after two weeks I understand why.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I have been in outpatient therapy at Casa Colina several times over the past 10 years. The doctors and therapists who have helped me are first rate and should get 5 stars. They do have a problem with communication within the outpatient staff regarding insurance and scheduling. It is worth the effort to call them if they do not call you and to call your own insurance provider if there are questions.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Only giving three stars because their staff is rude on the phone. They don’t problem solve all they do is hang up and you have to call back up to 4 times to get transferred to the right room.</review>< Rate>

What can I say about this Hospital but 🤔. Thank You. Thank you Casa Colina for the love and care you showed my mother for the 4th time once in 2001, 2015, 2018 and now 2019. Never have I ever been to a facility full of people that are so loving and so kind. It took a lot of weight  off my shoulder knowing that she was being taken care of. My mother showed up weak she had been in the hospital for a month and in 2 weeks she is so much stronger. Once again we appreciate you working on her physical inside and out and her spiritual with the sweetest Chaplin ever.  Thank you for being more than a hospital but a home away from home for my mother. The only thing that I want to say thanks a lot for is, because of PT my mom wants a Nintendo Wii lol.< /Text>

I was a patient at Casa Colina on for therapy.  I highly recommend C C for therapy.  They have excellent therapists.  I was a volunteer at CC for around 25 years and loved it.  The staff is wonderful to work for.< /review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>Only reason this is not a 5 star is because to make an appointment for an ultrasound, they were giving me a wait time of one month. Turns out I have a hernia that needs to be fixed, which explains 4 weeks of agony. I was lucky to have an opening turn up sooner, but imagine if I would have had to wait that long and in pain.

Staff is polite and once you do get there for an appointment or xrays which don't require appointments, wait time is reasonable.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I don't have good memories of being in casa colina as a patient, I almost got gangrene on my right leg, the nurses took almost 3 months to remove a special boot from my leg, I had developed an infection,they didn't want to remove the boot, they removed after my ex asked why after 3 months I still had the boot.
I have the scarred leg to prove it.
This people could have blamed have had the accident and the infection for developing gangrene, could have become an amputee

<Review>Dr. Fink is the 3rd Primary Care Physician I've had since I moved to the CV 4 years ago. Finally!! A doctor that isn't just "practicing medicine." The Doctor pays attention and listens.  She and her entire staff are very caring and patient. The billing AND order approval staff are incredibly efficient.  I'm truly thankful to have found such a professional practice.<//Review><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80daf9c431c8c08d:0xf1e805be8c5cfa1c< /Gmap_id><user>117851055551253395021< /user><Date>1621539138618< /Date>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>At first, Dr Fink was incredibly thoughtful and caring doctor. As a young adult with a heart condition I was referred to her for primary care upon release from the hospital where I had severe pneumonia and was diagnosed with heart condition. I was also prescribed Celexa by Dr. Fink for mild anxiety I was experiencing during Covid.  Over the course of 6 months the Celexa I was taking made me have suicidal thoughts, I gained 25 pounds, could not focus, and was extremely emotionally distressed every day. By not warning me of these extremely dangerous side effects not only was my heart health effected, my business was, and I was so depressed I had actually thought about suicide. After detoxing off this medication for 3 months, I have been much more happy, lost weight, and suicidal thoughts have completely gone away. I think Dr. Fink has amazing bedside manner, was truly caring during my visits. But the negligence in prescribing me an anti depressant with side effects that were so counter productive to my heart health and mental health I would advise questioning every single thing she prescribes you.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I can honestly say that I have never had a Primary Care Physician as cheerful, kind, easy-going, and most importantly as clinically knowledgeable (on the spot questions) as Sayda. When I met her for the first time, she asked me so many questions, but she made me feel comfortable the entire time. Which I think is important and essential. We even spent some time laughing during the appointment, which is different, because my past providers had always been so serious and down to business.. whereas, with Sayda, it’s all down to business but with a smile while she’s at it. She checked off all of my concerns and got a referral sent over to me for a specialist faster than I thought. Estimated wait time was ~2 weeks, and I received the note and info in 1 week. All in all, I would recommend Dr. Fink to anyone and everyone, especially if you’re a college student returning to the Valley after years of being gone and you’re looking for someone who is modern, genuine, cheerful, and charismatic. I don’t see myself changing my doctor anytime soon! Thank you Dr. Fink, you’re amazing ✨✨👩🏻‍⚕️</text>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Fink is a very engaged Primary physician. She spends time to educate me and family about modifiable risk factors, suggests healthy lifestyle changes that I could do such as diet, regular preventative screenings, increased activities that really empowers me so I can engage in my wellness and health. She clearly explains the diagnostics and lab results and all related plans of care.  The entire staff is professional and timely In reminding and follow up for referrals or appointments. The clinic is clean, and follows the standard for infection control related to the pandemic. Overall, our experience with Dr. Fink and her team is exemplary, most especially in this time of pandemic.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Being a new patient, I really had a great experience from the time I checked in -to check out. The staff makes you feel welcomed and they care. Dr Fink was awesome and took her time with you. Making sure she had addressed your concerns. Everyone there made you feel you mattered and not a number. Shout out to Stephanie to helping me with forms and also touching base with me if earlier appointments opened up. So sweet. Thank you to you all and I hope it never changes.< /review>

Just saw Dr Fink the other day, it has been 8 months since my last visit and what can I say, it was like she doesn't skip a beat. Shes so friendly and goes above and beyond in getting to the core issues. Hope and Gratitude come to mind when I think of Dr. Fink, she really sets the bar in patient care.

Dr.Fink and her staffs flow is remarkable, as a team they are through and know how to put your mind at ease from the moment you walk through the door to setting up your next appointment.

Truly appreciate having this quality care especially through unpredictable times.

From our heart to yours,
The Schmidt’s<//review>

Everyone was professional, from the front office to the back. Very clean office. I have been searching for a primary care physician since I moved to the desert. I finally found my MD. Dr. Fink is amazing. She listens and she cares.</review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>I have had an outstanding experience with Dr. Fink as my General Physician.  Dr. Fink has addressed many medical issues and when necessary, referred me to fine specialists.  I can not give enough praise to her for the time she has taken with me, her honest advice, spot on diagnosis, as well as a very caring manner.  Brenda, Dr. Finks assistant is a most patient person and after working with me, she deserves a medal!  My overall assessment of Dr. Fink and her practice is 5 stars.  Thank You for the opportunity to give feedback.<//review>< username>

Having Asthma my entire life she is well versed on new medications & treatments. Highly recommend her care. I really wanted a female Doctor and I am so glad I found her. Her office Team was very professional and helpful.</Text>

<Review>Doctor is great! But I hope she can read my review about her staffs. They don’t even bother to pick up phone calls. If they do, they will keep telling you to hold on.... after 30 mins, the other one pick up and said the same thing “ hold on”... so I waited for almost another 40 mins, the last girl told me she us new so she doesn’t know how to book new client then tells me to call back an hour later. Trust me! I call many times and they keep doing the same thing! I got so mad so I went to their office to make appointment, the lady told me to ho home and wait for their call for the appointment!!! Reallly!!!??? Should I scream at them!!??? What a careless facility!!!< /Review>< Name>

She actually listened to me, and what made me admire her even more and assure me that she wants to help me, is when I broke down crying because I haven’t been feeling well for months, I saw the compassion in her eyes as she got teary eyed and placed her hand on my shoulder to let me know that she is here to help me and listen to my needs and that she’s going to do her best. Never in my life have I seen bedside manner like that. Someone who actually cares. Thank you Dr. Fink, I’m feeling very hopeful after today!</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Sayda Fink is an amazing Dr. She is attentive and explains so that you can understand the plan moving forward! I am so happy to have her as my Doctor! She treats me with respect and I never feel like she is too busy! During these uncertain times she has kept steady as well as passionate with regard to patient anxiety related to COVID-19! I am so fortunate to have Dr. Fink in my life!< /Text>

I had my first appointment with Dr. Fink via Zoom as I was experiencing what I thought to be Covid symptoms.  I was feeling quite nervous about the whole thing, but Dr. Fink was wonderful.  She listened carefully and then walked me through everything I needed to know and gave me guidance on what I needed to do going forward.  I felt in very safe hands and very reassured by the end of the appointment.  Dr. Fink is very professional and  kind and takes the time.   As I have only recently relocated to the area, having to choose a new primary physician can be a daunting task.  I am very glad to have found her.< /text>

Arrogant. Quick to diagnose before you're even done explaining your history and without running any tests. I know other people who've had the same experience. I'm a nurse and have worked alongside plenty of doctors, none of them like her. Don't waste time letting someone who is overly confident and inexperienced manage your health.< /text>

Her concern and caring attitude showed through for the entire time I was with her.
I was also impressed that she took the time to call me personally for a follow-up !

<time>1594254108246<//time><rate>2</rate><Review>2 months ago I would have given Dr. Fink 4 or 5 stars, but increasingly Angie / Katrina the office managers at both of her practices got between helping the patient and the complexity of my mother's case was too much for their office. They complained of the amount of attention my mother required and started denying requests that could only be completed by the patient's primary care physician, saying that it wasn't doctor Fink's job. When it was the only person who's job it could be. They discharged my mother (the patient) a couple weeks ago, and sent a letter explaining that they would help for the next 30 days, but when they refused to continue to help, and are denying the patient access to her own records portal, this is negligent, and patient abandonment. While the patient's life is hanging in the balance (currently undergoing cancer therapy, and being taken care of at home) all PCP requests have stopped until a new PCP in person appointment initiates the legal requirement for authorizations/prescriptions, and orders. This is the most unusual and unprofessional medical relationship I've ever witnessed. The extra star is for Dr. Fink, who was professional and very good at her job, but this current experience has left us no choice but to review accordingly as this is about the whole team and the care my mother receives or lack there of, at the end of the day.</Review><userid>116769795554590531705<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend dr. Fink and her office. During my visit I was impressed with her bedside manner, knowledge and attention to details. Dr Fink did a very thorough exam, listen to all my concerns and spent enough time to answer all my questions. Her staff was very knowledgeable, professional, polite and efficient . Thank you dr. Fink.</Review>

Dr. Fink cares about her patients and always answers any question I have.< /review>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<text>I had left a few messages and unfortunately I never received a call back. I was also rushed from my appointment because Dr Fink said she needed to go eat lunch. I left her office feeling frustrated and ashamed. I have health issues due to my weight gain and I am obviously aware of this as I see myself in the mirror everyday.  She was short and harsh and lacked compassion. I don’t feel like she wanted to hear that I was on the right track to a healthy me. She also had no concern for my pain and muscle spasms and I left her office feeling defeated by a medical professional who is supposed to help me.< /text><Date>1571608476231<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>The cashier was honestly like real dumb I don’t know how else to put it nicely, when I got there there was a family waiting because she had gave them the wrong change or forgot it I don’t know. I ordered really simple drink and somehow she managed to actually mess it up I felt bad for her at first but I see the problem.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80900c2c16180947:0x2e34316b53802246< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

Emmanuel is always top of his game, when I come here, whether I order inside or online. He goes the extra mile to provide great service! To all the other staff members as well, I always feel welcome when entering AND when leaving. Even during this COVID-19 crises, with the sign on the door as to how many people can be in at once, they do a great job POLITELY getting people to follow these rules. Keep up the awesome work, you all! I love the great personalities and professionalism here! Great hiring on the part of the hiring manager!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I frequent this Jamba Juice every week and the staff had improved greatly. Before the customer service was sub par, but recently the stores have been more inviting and lively. The staff is extra courteous and helpful. I look forward to my visit each time.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpwgSsqX2J_W_l3DRHB-d0PYDgLe_9CMuYKK8L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNomPXkCs9d0qsFghYV0ybMT5iHPxYOyxMwSdwA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1549986936491, 'text': 'Bekah thanks for the great review!'}< /resp>< gmapID>

I have always had a good experience at this Jamba Juice as well as most of the other Jamba Juices I have went to. But speaking of this one in particular, they've always made my order right, very friendly staff and nice, clean facility..< /text>

< Review>
You know I usually like Jamba Juice and from a service perspective they were spot on! However I tried the new Electric Berry Breeze and what began as a wonderful burst of berries turned into your least favorite pop cycle in the twin pop bag. You know the one you eat on the hot day, only because it's hot and you need something cold to cool you off, but it doesn't have much flavor. You would not be eating it, but it's 103 outside and you need something to cool you off. Of course you discover this loss of flavor on your way home so it's too late to complain but you are super unhappy with your choice...yep this was my last trip to Jamba Juice...<//Review>

<review>It doesn't taste good anymore like it use to. Its not sweet enough 😔. Maybe get some kind of sweetener to give a better taste. A whipped cream perhaps 😋< /review></record>

They are great at the service they provide, also their drinks are pretty amazing. The only suggestions I would make is:
1: Customer service needs a little more work.
2: Pay more attention to detail to the orders.
(Our drinks were marked wrong)
Having to make suggestions -1 Star
Other than that, keep up the wonderful work guys.< /Text>

< Review>
After leaving the gym, I trying to get a protein shake without PB with extra protein (I expressed that I willing to pay extra) The worker would not accommodate my order in a sarcastic way. (She reminded me of where I was at) I felt like that was unprofessional. It was my first visit to this establishment, recommended/adviced by my wife and gym staff.
To the owner;
Thanks for your concern. This is not a reflection on your facility as a whole. Its just my experience at this one.</Review>

Gave 2 stars because previous service had been great. Pre-ordered a drink said it would be ready in 6 minutes went in 10minutes later and drink wasn't done. 2 people ordered at the counter while I was there and got their drink. Hmm.. was not happy with the crew on 05/24/19 @:3:15pm.<//Text>

<Review>They have really rude service, didn’t even greet us or nothing. She seem like she hated her job. But I still tipped her anyways, didn’t even say thank you. I also thought was weird that she didn’t even call out our order and I had to ask if this was mine and all I heard was a slight “yea” then she walked away. lol which was funny. The one in Lincoln center is way better! Rather go there for better service. Thanks anyways guys</Review><Name>Ann Satsuki< /Name><response>{'time': 1517410759547, 'text': 'Ann Satsuki oh no!

The ice cream is so delicious! So refreshing and I loved how they asked us if we wanted to try all the flavors. One thing I wished they would do is raise the prices!! I would pay double for what I got it for to be honest. It’s so cheap and I want to support them more. Love it and I’m coming back for more soon< /text>

Absolutely delicious! Rich flavors and very refreshing on a warm day. They offer different flavors  and you can mix them if you’d like. The staff is friendly and the service was fast! My husband and I will definitely be coming back here again.< /Review>

The ice cream here is water based and is a mix of raspado with actual ice cream.They have a lot of unique flavors and they also offer snacks like esquites and Fritos with the works. I had the jamaica and coconut ice cream and it was delicious!!  The customer service here was amazing as well. I truly recommend this place.< /review>< Pics>

Got this place recommended by a few people and when you get a local spot recommended you know you gotta check it out!
Honestly one of the best ice cream ive had and definitely coming back for sure!
When I walked in they recommended me the taro and I loved it so I ended up going with that flavor. The prices are decent 👌<//Text>

Great first time experience here! Very helpful and friendly staff, great menu selection, only thing I suggest if you get boba, to choose the cups. In the pouch the last bit of the Boba get stuck in the bottom and you may need a spoon to get it all.< /review>

Been here twice already and it’s a pretty decent place. I’ve gotten their mango mayhem smoothie and purple tea (taro). They have so much I want to try and they put some drinks in a bag which I find really cool. The only thing I dislike is their boba, seems a little over cooked, but not too bad.< /Review>

<Review>Ordered the ice cream and Pulp latte! Definitely the best Pulp ice cream I've had in awhile. Could really taste the Pulp favor in the ice cream, sadly can't say the same about the latte, the almond milk overwhelmed the green tea but still good.<//Review>< pictures>

The boba was an amazing addition to my mango smoothie. If I could I would visit Pulp Juice Bar everyday! I would recommend getting the mango mayhem. The service was also very good!</Text><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

this place seems to be a typical coffee house vibe with some board games, a few tables and a couch to hang out at. They have a few different kinds of items on their menu such as acai bowls, juices, smoothies, and milk teas with boba.

Me and my friend tried the jasmine milk tea and the regular milk tea with boba. There's a lot of boba places near me so compared to them, pulp juice bar didn't have the best boba i've ever had just because the boba itself was pretty hard that we couldn't even eat it. I think out of the two options, both me and my friend would definitely prefer the jasmine milk tea over the regular one.

This place is definitely insta worthy and honestly it was pretty cool drinking something out of a pouch, its like an adult version of the capri sun! Next time I go I'll try one of their juices for sure.<//Text>

<Name>Megan Hill< /Name><Review>I always have a great experience at Smiles For Health.  I went to one dentist my whole life prior to moving to Californian a few years ago, so I was uncertain to say the least about finding a new dentist. Dr. Zorro is kind, professional, and great at what she does. Taylor and the other staff are excellent. I feel like I am in good hands when I visit, the staff is always super nice, and the office is beautiful and immaculate. Highly recommend.<//Review>< Rating>

I have been going to Smiles for Health for about two years. The practice is very clean, and has all top-of-the-line equipment.

They are always extremely friendly and professional when contacting me about appointments, questions, etc. As soon as you walk into the office for your appointment they check you in, ask you if you need any water, etc.

At my most recent visit I was taken in for my cleaning almost immediately. My dental hygienist, Taylor, was very thorough, knowledgeable, and patient. She took the time to ask me if I had any questions and went over any concerns with me.

Dr. Zorro is always a pleasure to speak with. She always remembers me from previous visits, and her bedside manner can't be beat.< /Review>

I cannot say enough about the reception I received yesterday from the entire staff at Smiles For Health Dentistry. From my original phone call describing my emergency dental care request I felt that this facility had my care as a number one priority. They were able to fit me in same day and the online process of registration was seamless. Upon entering the office I found a bright, friendly, welcoming atmosphere that I waited in for a very short time before I was escorted back to a very nice room with a beautiful piece of art to admire while my x-rays were taken. It seemed like moments before I met Dr Zorro who was courteous and careful in her exam and subsequent recommendations. Able to continue, she, with great support from her staff, performed a triple root canal on my molar.
Stopping at times to show and discuss this hour long process I am amazed at her patience, diligence and concern for a perfect resolution to my extremely severe pain. I thank Dr Zorro and all her staff for relieving my pain and fully recommend both Dr Zorro and her staff to anyone who wishes for patient, minimally painful dentistry in a wonderful setting with a very nice group of caring professionals.< /Text>

Dr. Zorro and her staff are a great team.  From the moment you arrive, you are greeted warmly in a very comforting setting.  While a dentist visit is no one’s idea of a great time, they do everything possible to ensure the experience is a positive one.  We feel fortunate to have them as part of our wellness program.<//text>

I haven’t been to a dentist office for a few years because my last experience was extremely uncomfortable and extremely expensive even with health insurance. My experience with Smiles for Health was the complete opposite! The staff is so sweet and welcoming in a very genuine way. The office is beautiful and the decor and aroma therapy is very calming. Dr Zorro was awesome! She took so much time explaining what she saw on my X-rays and pictures, I felt like I was in good hands. My deep cleaning was actually not bad at all! The dental hygienist was super sweet and empathetic to any discomfort I was having (which, really wasn’t much). And lastly, the cost was very fair and worth every penny.<//Text>

I was very happy with my visits. I am glad I found a great dental office. Tina is super helpful during my check-in and follow up. Dr. Zorro was extremely thorough during my cleaning and my fillings were painless. Dr. Zorro also spent time explaining different things to watch for and how to prevent future issues. Bri was helpful and made sure I knew what was going on. The whole team was warm and friendly. Highly recommend!!< /Review>

After dealing with a headache of different offices I finally called Smile for health and immediately was helped and set an appointment within a 5 minute phone call. They were able to fit me in immediately and take care of me. The entire staff was great and friendly but I definitely hope to helped by Bri and her bubbly personally. I highly recommend this place and will gladly be coming back even though I hate the dentist.<//Review>

<review>Rebekah at the front desk is very friendly and always offers water when you arrive. Bri is super accommodating and is very nice to talk with. Taylor is a very thorough hygienist and has great advice for upkeep in between visits. Marcos is very knowledgeable about my son's hobbies like UFC and is very down to earth when talking about it. Dr. Zorro goes above and beyond and is a very skilled dentist and we have never been uncomfortable under her care. This is the best facility we have been to and the charges are much kinder to your wallet than previous dental fees from other offices in the past. 5/5 for sure. Thanks again :)</review>< pics>

Before I started going to Smiles for Health I was so afraid of going to the dentist. After one visit I was already starting to feel the anxiety leave me. The staff there is so kind and accommodating. I immediately knew I would be in good hands. This week I go in for my first cleaning in 7 plus years and I’m actually feeling good about it. I can’t wait to get the smile 😃 I have always dreamed of.<//review>

Amazing customer service and care!  Dr. Zorro's and her team go out of there way to make sure you are comfortable and answer any questions you may have.  At no point do you feel rushed, to the contrary they make you feel at home.  The quality of work is top notch!  I went for veneers and can not be happier with the attention to detail.  Thank you Dr. Zorros!< /Review>

<Date>1620481992512<//Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>I was eating breakfast with a client next door @Richard Walkers Breakfast spot at Bressi Ranch which is a cute little industrial Mecca located off Palomar Airport road, Carlsbad, Ca.
The staff is AMAZING!  The office is CLEAN, MODERN, CUTTING EDGE EQUIPMENT, and the Doctors have take. Every step to welcome you as a new member of their family. Your well-being  is the priority!
On my first visit, I received a thorough assessment, then explained in detail my necessary work, which was broken down by health not wealth sustainability.
Being sensitive to sticker shock, they took a smart approach only showing my critical procedures first. Allowing the patient to assess time, money and other surrounding factors. I truly appreciated this, as it made it less overwhelming. We then scheduled my cleaning and first steps toward better health.
I recommend this team with the highest regard, and look forward to being a patient for years to come!
If you’re looking for a reasonable #dentist in the area, give them a try, let them know I referred you and pass on the good!

If you are looking for a topnotch dental practice, Smiles for Health is the place for you. From the first call to the completed treatment, you are treated with kindness and respect. Dr. Zorro and her entire staff are such caring and compassionate individuals.

When you step into the office, you are greeted with a warm welcome from the beautiful smiling Christina. She ensures that all your forms are properly completed and then she screens you. Next you see Bri the dental assistant who is very thoughtful, caring and efficient. If you are doing cleaning you will meet Taylor who is kind, thorough, understanding and efficient. Dr. Zorro takes personal interest in your overall health. She spends time to get to know you and ensure that you get the best care possible. She is a compassionate professional who is skilled in the art and science of dentistry. To top it off, the facility is not only safe and impeccable, but it is equipped with the most modern equipment. The exam rooms have safety air filters installed and live plants on shelves on the wall facing you. Oh, I almost forgot! You are offered aromatherapy with essential oils also.

All of this contribute to a calming, relaxing and comfortable visit and a positive experience that you will always remember and want to share. Thank you Dr. Zorro and staff. God bless.

<text>Dr. Zorro is a nice person but I’ve had nothing but problems here. Several mistakes,  quality problems, scheduling issues, waiting every visit because they run late, and over charges that weren’t covered by my insurance because the fees were double the covered amount resulting in high out of pocket expenses. In the end, I have decided to go elsewhere to have work completed that wasn’t done satisfactorily.</text>< user_name>

I am grateful to have found Smiles for Health. The office and the staff are very comforting, The aromatherapy helped me feel at ease. Dr Zorro listened all my concerns and showed me all my teeth even the airway with the CBCT. I am grateful for what I was able to understand. She gave me many alternate solutions. I believe she cares about patients and I recommend Smiles for Health for all your dental needs.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>My previous dentist mentioned that I have some stains on my back teeth, but they're not cavities and don't need new fillings.  My previous dentist also suggested that none of my old fillings need replacing.

Smiles for Health suggested that these stains were cavities and need new fillings.  Smiles for health also suggested that ALL my old fillings needed replacement.

I got a 3rd opinion from another dentist and I have no new cavities and none of my old fillings need to be replaced.  None of these old fillings are visible when I smile.  I understand that this is a business and needs to make a profit... but profit should not come from unnecessary procedures and unnecessary suffering from the patient.<//Text>< pics>

I’ve had a root canal and a tooth pulled so far. I’m the person you tell your kids about to convince them to brush their teeth. But as such I’m familiar with the bedside manner of Dr. Zorro and her team.

They’re an absolutely lovely group of people. They’ve worked very hard, and I’ve watched Dr. Zorro think very carefully as to the best way to help me. They quickly gained my trust and I’ve deeply appreciated their kindness and professionalism during my procedures. These things hurt, but they do their absolute best to assure one's comfort to the best the situation allows.

In light of COVID-19, they’ve done everything they can to take care of folks in as safe a manner as possible. I’m thankful they’re open as I had an emergency, which led me to them.

I highly suggest going here.</text>

We moved to the west coast towards the end of last year and during the move I chipped my front tooth. I needed to find a new dentist ASAP. I did a little research and found Smiles for Health.  Dr Zorro and her team are professional, caring and friendly.  Their offices are also beautiful with state of the art equipment. My front tooth experience went so well I decided to bring my kids to Smiles for Health for their cleanings . We have now seen her both before and during Covid, and each time has been a good experience . We have had cleanings and fillings and every time we were made to feel comfortable. I highly recommend Dr Zorro for all of your dental needs.< /Review>

<Review>Once again, I am leaving an outstanding review for Dr. Zoro and her staff Bri and Gina. I came a followup visit for the placement of a crown... it was done and felt good but their was a small flaw from the manufacturer, which I could not see. She wanted it to last and be correct, so sent it back to be corrected. Today I returned and Bri was extremely delicate and gentle, with dr Zoro both doing an excellent job. I continue to be impressed from the receptionist, assistant and doctor. Thanks for your amazing services.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1605633730690, 'text': 'Thank you Bobby!

Dr. Zorro and her team are a breathe of fresh air! For someone who has dental anxiety, I quickly forgot I was at a dental office! I was thoroughly impressed by Dr. Zorro and her team! If you want a dentist that offers a holistic approach, and thinks outside the box of mainstream dentistry, then Dr. Z and her team are the right fit for you! I will be seeing them again very soon! 🙂<//review>

Their sanitary processes are on point.  The cleaning was the best cleaning I have ever had.  While Dr. Zoro scraped plaque during the cleaning, she did not poke and jab my gums.  It was so pleasing to have a cleaning that was incredibly thorough yet gentle at the same time!
I also had to have a filing done.  And this also, was the most amazing experience I have had getting a cavity filled!  Again, she was so very gentle.  I am so so happy to have found this dental office and I cannot recommend Dr. Zoro and her staff enough!!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

For the last few years i’ve been bouncing around from dentist to dentist... i’ve been either treated like another number or been over charged for dental work... last week I had a bad tooth ache 😖  so this made me go on yelp to try to find a dentist close to home... And that’s when I found “Smiles for Health” Dr Zorro! Anyone that knows me knows that I am the worst patient when it comes to go to the dentist... But Dr Zorro and Anna made me feel so comfortable. Before anything they explain to me step-by-step what I needed and make sure that I was comfortable with the procedures and their pricing... today I had my second visit with Dr Zorro and Anna, Dr’s Assistan... when Anna saw me walk in the door, she  greeted me with a hug...  The procedure that I had done today was painless and I almost fell asleep....I’ve already making sure that my kids and husband schedule an appointment to go see her. Dr Zorro thank you 🙏🏻 😊 for making it easy and fun... yes fun to come see you... looking forward to my next appointment< /Review>

They accept reservations for indoor and outdoor seating. Their outdoor, rooftop patio is gorgeous and equipped with heaters. The customer service is excellent, along with the atmosphere. The food was savory and well-seasoned. One of our friends is a bread-a-holic and rated their bread one of the best he's ever had. Even the clam chowder was delicious! This is a must go. It's a little on the pricey side, but 100% worth it. Try the Salmon and lasagna. Enjoy!</Review>

Very cute little restaurant in the heart of Carmel. Outdoor seating feels like you’re in a treehouse with the elevated balcony. We were told to wait 20 minutes for a table but were seated almost immediately. Nice bathroom!

COVID wise: servers wore their masks but didn’t enforce guests at all. Tables were very close together with little to no distancing.

Menu was only 2 pages long but had a variety of cuisines such as burgers, thai curry, pastas, and spanish paella.</Text>

Cute outdoor patio setup. Staff all really friendly. However, I got the paella, and even there was ample shrimp, some mussels, sausage slices, chicken, salmon and a bit of bell peppers, the ratio to rice was off. And it was $36…</text>

Beautiful scenery, food tasted great but be ready to spend some money. Willing to let us sample wine prior to buying.< /Review>

However the manager, or whoever he was, was SUPER nice. He helped us get our stroller up the stairs, and was very accommodating to our family. He stopped by our table to ask how the food was even though he was not our waiter. He was kind, happy, polite, professional, and extremely hospitable. We will go back just because this guy was great. Great service and great food.

The ambiance, outdoor seating, heaters, and lights were great. All around a 5-star place to dine.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005< /gmap_id></record>

Nice little place, perfect for a quiet fancy night. My group was fully vegetarian and we had to scrape the menu for veg food. The mushroom ravioli was delicious - a must try. We also had pasta and red thai curry, which were both just okay. The garlic bread was a pleasant surprise and I'd totally recommend it.<//text>

Amazing outdoor dining.  The Seafood Paella was a very large portion - perhaps meant for sharing.  The shrimp were giant!  Baklava was delicious and DH says they have the best Clam Chowder.  We came on a Friday late afternoon around 4pm and we were seated right away.  All employees were smiling under their masks (I could see it in their eyes)  It was perfect!< /text>

Excellent restaurant, unfortunately only takeout at present. Our take out dinner a couple of nights ago was very good. Probably the best lamb I have eaten in a very long time. The owner ws very pleasant and helpful. It's slightly on the pricier side, but typical of Carmel pricing, however the food was absolutely worth it. We will order again from them before we leave Carmel in a few days.

4/10/21 update.

Had the opportunity to visit this restaurant again, but this time for indoor dining.

My review thoughts have not changed. This is a very very good restaurant. The menu is quite eclectic, from Thai curry to steak to kebabs. I once again had the lamb kebabs, and once again they were outstanding.

The wait staff service was also very good.

Should be very high on any Carmel visitors restaurant dining list< /review>

Treehouse was recommended by the sommelier at one of the wine tastings we went to. It was a great rec - small family-owned restaurant with a wide variety of food options. The family is consistently checking in on guests.

I got the lamb stroganoff and my partner got the shrimp pasta. Both were good, but would probably try something new off the menu next time! The sommelier highly recommended their curries. One of the best parts was oil mixture they served with bread and no corkage fee if you bring Scheid wine!< /review>

<review>We ordered grilled sea bass and grilled salmon. Both served piping hot. Both very good. We also ordered a Greek salad which was good. We had mango raspberry cheese cake and baklava for dessert. Both were good. Overall, great service, great food but very expensive. But I guess, in Carmel, that may be expected.</review>< date>

The place is pretty, but the food is awful. Burgers with no fries. Ordered the Philly cheese sandwich and it was gross. Chicken Alfredo pasta, the chicken is dry. Don’t come here. There are better places.<//review>

Last week was the first time we visited this magnificent restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the finest  dishes and fine drinks and with the comfortable price. We will definitely return there again.< /Review>

The Spanish Paella was delicious! Finger-licking good. Perfectly paired with the dreaming tree wine. Also, we were lucky to be given free dessert. (Thank you, treehouse!) The baklava was beautiful!

Personal Touch ⭐⭐

Restaurants are like love affairs. It doesn't have to be perfect, but some things will make it last.

We came from a far to visit this restaurant. We waited about 40 minutes for a table. Met Fadi, the Jordanian entrepreneur who owns the restaurant. Very pleasant.

The food was absolutely delicious. The sauces were just perfectly done, not overly creamy, just the right consistency. The food combinations were awesome.

The server didn't recommend any appetizers. Went from drinks to main course. When asked about the Ravioli special vs. the seafood pasta, he said he liked both but couldn't recommend one over the other. So I ordered both. Though the owner knew we came from a far and it was to celebrate a birthday, there was no effort to make the birthday girl's evening special.

The server only visited the table just once since the order. The owner didn't visit any tables while we were there.

We would have ordered dessert and wine had the service was better. This is where the relationship part come in. We would have gladly spent a lot more money, but went elsewhere for dessert and wine.

There was a table of 4 next to us who just had water, no dessert, but was googling where to go from there. Missed opportunity.

There are many great restaurants in Carmel. We come to Carmel often. We come for that special Carmel experience and service. I hope Fadi realizes that it's a privilege to have customers, not a privilege to eat at his restaurant. Make the customers feel amazing and they will return even if the food missed a beat that day or on that dish.

Great potential at this location and at this restaurant. Keep the kitchen staff, but change the attitude, spend more time taking care of your customers. Get to know them. They will come back. They will spend more money per check. They will be more forgiving.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP8hkMQFYDV2Us9G96c0nZYW4uTiiMxQQZN2y7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH7I57YDX73KL4qzsiCwwOot9Tn4SXKHj54dkx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPczFPBIyirFoiwh5EjBwtumP9X_mwRj8Zj6b-b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk-dxZWlFX-1UiMBU3iOJETgHAsRPzf-DgeWxU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxqh-MLbuFovBbYUzWYW-W62iYkDEE1G_dqUc4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhh9wzafbgMUsRab2oUPbqxiLMY6hu--3qNk_C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOgpouGel1KYPtQLrniUXIjMD9AOeSK067wO-p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwFcs6uCIfZ1N3h7M6kDmjaqyVHzebAaNWoMa6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML31HoVwqAJhKeSTZzQP5KDWNyq0tNWMZSU0V-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0yoyIQNXWngPw3Wqjk_Y7kwqt1IVpUM9eV8k5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIffAC0Aveeu-mvr6r9DVLlQqEx1OSmcFyY80y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT3x73WOKwtHQ9jLq9y4Ne2y3-PZWNMED5LPWy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSXh87N0-KjL5UnF-tBGtp-0yNMtSOdehJdpWz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqIY2bHfAhdcT991nqsFbNcEpHYKScuMVGV5tu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIK1dYa8-82dHUevNnCF09YaxVegdionKY_YA9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN16cuCujVR4Ba1ESg-fUb_hZPInvoReSB4br0o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAfwBFJ6hMcAFdbWYTScibb809p90Std6PA-mq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO53mPYuKal8fpVb9nAdWd-TWhXhT1JmjUcobWT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi6mfEbtMno-B4ttdnMY9QfC_zCa89Wf4SIAEZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVUC3n5EvZF_i38_U5mFBh8P_Lg19X9uxStuBj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaeSBX5FvaMIxGnjYFYeqO5qV4QPwEU-0-RsmH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqCMBUeL_2tU8CWyYnnAe61e6LiWLk2031UXlU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPullYDQhFj3iT5wsXbUNxmxtVpubJEglgnTV8-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8tnyTxNcEk8ZfZbi5b40kC2xhLhLVJ8Mx8eRD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB8bd8z8cdvKE9dJjsJyY6V-hQ1fCc8zKykylp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4M9WOKIDtSGkQEhwmywSdU6m1CqeCO0iEWbT6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrj4lmAkSeXSg0t5l24BApwPcuph4Vo9hpJjNj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1yDYgozjnDKOH-0EsWWFsKyo8kl7qvq7OZoYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsoRXzs3nRIWlDW6fmxyjSYUBbJFdwzjhxquL0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7p7Tq7JRlgq_uz6nGtXXTrzXdW1GrrccnpTWz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8l6GX0NbYXtm8n9MTGMC6f-vI-uJbY-Dayt3B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPElh07E7Sq4ZePzcZBMxiEZ1GRgQaSTMF_MVde=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNproBNRMdikE75CR9eB0rTss9CYefs5J1sZb4T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtVFJ6__jWAqmgOCQffM_jwWAaoueeL3DXzFvL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs30uc_baUAXXRBGoCks9OdpNtnNxfaFmoYZFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We celebrated my birthday here. Daniel - our server has given us 5 stars service. He made us feel so welcomed. Excellent Mediterranean food, Greek salad was freshly made with care. The grilled calamari was so delicate( although I wished they actually would grilled it instead of battered it). Very delicious though.
The chicken kabobs was tender, juicy and very flavorful( I’m very picky when it comes to chicken kabobs). Treehouse Cafe got this down.I would come back again on my next trip.</Text>

<Review>Lovely little roof top oasis. My only complaint is that some seats are directly in the sun and everything is crammed in a little tight on the balcony, but I'd absolutely go back - with sunscreen.< /Review><UserId.>109320838541008993494</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Best food we've had in Carmel, out of the fixed or so places at which we've eaten in the past year. Just watch out for the $9/bottle sparkling water.< /Text>

First time in Carmel and friends recommended this place and it’s across from our hotel.
It was super yummy!! Had gyros for appetizer, seafood pasta and lamb kabobs - and baklava for dessert! Also had a glass of Sangria and I usually don’t enjoy red sangria but it was the best I’ve had!
They had us eat on patio upstairs which was beautiful! Would definitely recommend!!</text>

The deck seating was just right for today with a warm sun and cool air. The fresh pesto was balanced and tasty, the stroganoff a great comfort-food choice. Be ready to walk off the meal afterwards!<//Review>

What a darling little restaurant with amazing food! I didn't have high expectations and they blew me away. The bread is phenomenal. And the pasta bolognese and beef stroganoff were the best we've ever had!

Just as important as food was the ambience. You fill like you are sitting on a little rooftop in Europe. The service was friendly, quaint, and intimate.

Will definitely be back!</Review>

<text>Delicious!  I got the chicken pesto pasta, which was perfect.  Papardelle was done just right, the chicken was juicy and high quality, and the pesto sauce was terrific.  My wife got the dolmas, which she enjoyed, and my daughter got a huge cheeseburger which she devoured without complaint.  Service very friendly and attentive.  We didn't want to wait for outdoor seating, which looked really nice -- next time, though!<//text><Gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005<//Gmap_id></record>

Treehouse Cafe is fantastic. The terrace is beautiful with the sound of a fountain in the background, La Vie en Rose on the surround sound, mimosa in hand with a prawns cessar salad for brunch. Doesn’t get much better than this on a sunny day in Carmel! Service, atmosphere, and food were wonderful.</Review>

Great food. They are working under their social distancing rules, and obviously trying hard. All the servers and bussers wear masks.

I recommend making a reservation earlier as they are very popular in weekends.

The Calamari is really good. It's not your classic small rings. In stead it is a slab of high quality squid that is breaded and cooked. My wife doesn't like calamari, and she loved this. It was not chewy at all.</Review>

Absolutely loved the location and charm of this place - very cool patio and indoor area also. Did not love the food, unfortunately. Our dishes were very bland with flavor, although they were well-presented and filling.
Staff was completely lovely, but our server seemed a little disappointed that I ordered a soda instead of wine.
Bear in mind I’m a simple man of simple tastes, so upscale places aren’t my forte, but hopefully this review can help another in my situation.
Overall, I’d 100% recommend this place to a trendy, spendy friend looking for a new experience because it’s really neat. But I would not go back myself because I prefer taste and value to atmosphere.<//text>

<Text>Loved their wine (heavy pours) and had a great appetizer and bread! But unfortunately when my friend went inside to go to the bathroom she overheard one of the managers talking about very controversial political opinions! While we had different political stances, I'm okay with it but try not to talk about it in front of paying customers. Especially when she was saying some offensive stuff :(<//Text><user>109454113286177130303< /user>< Time>

Great place to have lunch, the size of the plates is good, the quality of the food is great as well and they were very friendly. I give 4 stars because I would loved it if they had more vegetarian/vegan options. But I would totally recommend this place.< /review>

< Review>
My husband and I have been here twice. Last time I had the smoked salmon sandwich- it was everything you would want out of a salmon sandwich. We also had the dolma appetizer, which was pretty up there with some of my favorite dolma. This time we had the goat cheese and honey with crostini and my husband had the chicken pesto sandwich and I had mussels as an entree (I scarfed them down before I remembered to take a pic. Whoops!) also the patio is the best seating in Carmel. It does fill up very quickly, because it’s a pretty small place!</Review>

Fab cute little restaurant minutes away from the beach at Caramel. Cozy outside sitting with heating lamps at twilight adds a lot of romance and warmth, no matter the occasion ( not to mention a dog friendly place). The menu is more than satisfying with a rich assortment of Italian, Thai and Mediterranean options. I am going again (worth the 2 hours drive from Mountain View).<//text>

<Review>After having read such great reviews online about the Treehouse Café we decided to try it for dinner. Unfortunately, we left very unsatisfied.
We ordered the bolognese pasta and the sauce tasted undone and like the sofrito base didn’t cook down enough. The special was a creamy tomato seafood pasta and it lacked flavor. We’re not too big on adding a ton of salt to food but the sauce needed it. We also ordered the cheese burger medium rare and it was brought to the table well done.
I will say that the wine pour was generous and good and the ambience was quaint and cute. However, the food did not meet our expectations. We’ve had our share of pastas in Italy and nonna’s cooking but this did not taste authentic. In fact, it stung when we received the bill and saw how much we were charged.
Being that Carmel attracts many tourists year round I hope that the Treehouse Café makes some improvements to the food.</Review><Time>1593406266450</Time>< Resp>

Great spot. Hospitality is wonderful.  Menu is eclectic a little of everything. Delicious California and Mediterranean cuisine. Plates look great. Tastes are well thought out. Food well prepared. Good low priced wine menu with big pours. We have eaten there many times and for me it is my go to. Eat outside 1 floor above the street or more intimately inside. I highly recommend Tree House.< /Text>

The food at Treehouse Cafe was very delicious. I ordered the Gyros for lunch and it was excellent, the beef was moist and not dry. It was too bad I didn't have room for the Greek burgers my companions ordered as well because they looked very very good and I wanted some too. The wait staff were very friendly and polite and very accommodating for our water requests on a hot day. I loved the decor and ambiance in the restaurant too. There was a queue for the single bathroom but that was no biggie the food and service were great!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><user>108188067025725934348<//user><username>Julia Most<//username><pictures>None</pictures><text>The food is amazing here. The host, waiters, bussers and cooks all worked amazing together last night as a team. The restaurant was so busy and the wait was long. I highly recommend making reservations in advance... Just don't be too upset when your reservation becomes delayed because a large group doesn't want to finish their wine. I got to give it to this restaurant last night. I made reservations for 8 pm last night.. we probably were seated around 8:30pm maybe later it was definitely crowded. The staff all were wearing masks perfectly like you would hope. Tables are spaced apart. Only con is they only have one restroom... But what can you do.

I had the calamari for an appetizer and yellow curry for dinner. My spouse has the Greek burger with salad. Both were mouth watering. I don't normally like calamari but it was a steak and cooked to perfection.
This place has a wonderful romantic atmosphere and is dog and family friendly. If you are willing to wait for a seat on the deck I think it is worth it.
Thank you staff for our best night in Carmel. A great way to end a small vacation post covid.< /text><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005<//gmap_id><time>1592174536607</time></record>

Had a great quiet meal in a quaint restaurant. We had lamb kebabs with saffron rice and a prawn pasta dish in a garlic cream sauce. Scrumptious bread. Eclectic menu . Great service. No wait and meal came within like 15 minutes.< /Text>

It’s our go-to place to eat when we are in the area. We usually have our dogs & kids, and we love how welcoming they are every time!! The food is fantastic and the price is reasonable. Pleasant Ambience indoor & on the deck. Always super friendly and customer-service oriented.< /text>

<Text>The ambience and setting is amazing. I called for the fish ($27) which was undercooked and tasted off. I called for extra sauce twice, it never came. The bread served with the roasted garlic does not pair well at all. The staff is friendly but no one came to check how the meal was. Other stuff we ordered was decent.< /Text>< Pics>

Menu is eclectic with leaning to Mediterranean. Wife had lamb kabobs, I had Paella. Lamb was extremely tender and was delicious! Pasole was fantastic! Clams and mussels were tender, chicken melt in your mouth and just enough sausage to give it some spice and flavor. We both had wine which was a large pour for the price. Will definitely go back!</Review>< Resp>

<review>If you take anything away from this review please remember that the food was awesome and we will be back! We enjoyed our gyro salad, platter, and lamb kabobs tremendously! The reason my review slipped from 4 to 3 stars were some logistical issues we had with our experience. First the bathroom situation is a bit limited with only one toilet for the entire restaurant and it was a bit messy and without paper towels. Second there seemed to be a lack of silver ware as we were provided set ups in waves, so first forks, then knives and napkins. Can’t wait to check back with Tree House once these two things are resolved!<//review>< Pictures>

Excellent food;  very nice and friendly staff; and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  We had the gyro platter, the chicken kabob platter, the hummus and the bruschetta. I honestly can't say which dish was best, because they were all so good! The restaurant itself is fun and the music they play is so welcome. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin. ..oldies galore! Definitely go if you visit Carmel.< /text>

<review>Great Mediterranean food with outstanding service! We sat outside on the 2nd story patio & loved the atmosphere! The gyros are really good & my husband said the pork sausage appetizer is the best sausage he's ever had! We went to lunch at 11:15 & had no problem getting a table. They are kid friendly (and dog friendly too!). We'd go back!</review><user_name>Jenna Guggisberg</user_name>< Resp>

<text>The place is amasing, amasing food and atmosphere but carmel.expansive, not one $ price mark.like it is said on google.maps.and yelp, between $$$ and $$$$ main courses start from.20$ to 35$ burgers from 15 to 18 salads from 12 to 22, firsts fro 6 to 17

Great music design.and.people

Stumbled across this place while strolling through Carmel. I was a little hesitant given the diverse menu, but what a great find. Staff were not just friendly but entertaining. I had the Green Curry with Chicken and would dare say most Thai restaurants could not achieve it’s fine taste. My wife had the Chicken Kabobs and was cooked to perfection and had a freshness to the meat and salad. Wonderful setting out on the patio overlooking the street with heat lamps adding to quite a cozy atmosphere.<//review>

During a recent trip to Carmel, I ate here with family.  Food was exceptionally delicious!  A memorable meal, and beautiful setting.  Loved the outdoor dining area.

I've been to many very good restaurants over the years, but never given a 5 star rating.  This is the first!  😮☺</review>

Love this place. The food is wonderful and so are the staff. They really should have a lunch menu instead of same prices for lunch and dinner. 15 for a tuna sandwich just doesn't seem right. Prices are great for evening but a little too much for a quick bite!  Overall great ambiance and people and food</text>

We stopped at this beautiful town and found this restaurant. The rooftop plays Mediterranean music with a cozy environment. We ordered the Greek Burgers that come with a salad. Both were great! The burger was on point and super tasty. The grilled onions was amazing. The stuff was super friendly as well. Highly recommend.<//Text>

Calamari appetizer
The Greek burger w carmelized onion..the best w Greek side salad.
Topped off w a Lime pie & Chocolate cake for the table ..delicious.
My niece was impressed that the waiter didn't write anything down.
We all laughed & talked how professional customer service they have in Carmel by the Sea.  Very top notched food experience.
Tremendous wine selection...

Lovely outdoor venue, perfect for enjoying the breeze, CA sunshine, great food, and a glass of vino with a friend. Honestly, I really did feel as if I was dining in a tree house! The manager who greeted us was joyful, classy, and accommodating. The service and food was excellent. If you are on vacation, as we were, and want to experience the flavor of this quaint, charming, seaside town,  this restaurant is a must!< /review>

<Review>I rarely say a restaurant is perfect but I’m sayin it now! First of all we were super late for our Sat night reservation and they just giggled and seated us immediately- even giving us a choice of tables. The waiters are so friendly and warm and appropriately attentive and so flippin’ handsome (not that that matters). Oh yes, the food...we are vegetarians so had the Caesar salad- delish, lentil soup- the perfect blend of flavors and the veggie pasta with an incredible sauce to slide the soft yet crunchy cooked to perfection bread in. To seal the deal we had key lime pie for dessert and I know my KLPs and it was excellent. I wish I lived here so I could eat her all the time. Thanks for a delightful dining experience and comfy ambience.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>A great little eatery in Carmel, the rooftop seating area is really good, they do not take reservations but if the wait is not too long its is worth it. the food was good. had the beef stroganoff with pasta which was decent but could have maybe had a little more meat, my partner had the Gyros which was excellent. the entire experience was quaint and I would return.</Review>< user_id>

<text>We sat at the outside patio. It was nice weather, but noticed they do have heaters when needed. We had the Salmon dish, Sea Bass, Beef Stroganoff, Yellow Curry and the Ribeye special. All were delicious. Fyi, the curry was considered more spicy (than mild as stated by menu) by someone who loves spicy hot foods, so it was fine. This place is a local favorite of 2 people in our group. Was the first time for the others, but all agreed we would come back.< /text><Date>1568082649208<//Date><Name>Truckin Tortuga<//Name>< pictures>

Food here was good, and service was excellent. We came in for a quick bite before we left on a long drive back home. We sat outside, which was very pleasant. They didn't have a kids menu, but made a small plate for my baby from one of the menu items. Nice experience overall.</text>

<review>One of the Hidden Gems of Carmel by the Sea, superb service amd ambient atmosphere. Ordered Lamb Kebab and Gyro Sandwich for 2 of us. Lamb meat was delicious without any extra fat and tasted awesome. Greek Salad was fresh and held to the flavor.
Certainly will havr to come back and try other great looking delicacies.
Keep up the good work.</review>< date>

<Review>Favorite restaurant in Carmel these days. Especially when dining with our dog Winston, who the staff remembers from year to year.  Great food, personalized service.  They make a great olive oil-parmesan cheese dip for bread.  Probably the best outdoor seating in Carmel.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I was expecting at least a solid 3 in dining experience, based on the overall 4.6 rating (restaurant ratings in and around Monterey seem to be artificially inflated, for some reason).

The servers were friendly, but did forget to put our appetizer order in. We got the chicken pesto pasta and the beef stroganoff. Both dishes were severely lacking in meat portions, so we ended up paying about $22 - $24 for a bowl of noodles. The meals were relatively bland and tasteless. I think this restaurant uses its location, rather than food quality, to attract customers.

The chicken pesto pasta was greasy and oily for some reason. The chicken was not great.

The beef stroganoff was the saddest thing we received. There were 5 tiny pieces of beef in a huge bowl of noodles. They advertised mushrooms in this recipe, but we found no mushrooms in the bowl. They advertise this as Russian beef stroganoff. What they neglect to mention is this is the wartime rationed meat version of Russian beef stroganoff.

Overall, we were extremely disappointed and will not be back. I don't know what's up with the 5 star reviews, but we certainly did not have a great experience. I believe just about any restaurant in the Barnyard shopping center is superior, so I recommend you go there instead.</Text>

Pretty place for sure, but without being treated right, it's hard to appreciate it.

We were seated by an uncomfortable corner of the patio right next to where the waiters constantly walk past. That was okay, since we could've chosen to change. Once our waiter appeared, he asks us 3 questions stereotyping us, mechanically and unthinkingly. After his "revealing questions", it is soon exposed within seconds of being seated that we are vegetarians. Again, too soon and too mechanically, he gives us 3 quick options that are the only ones available to us and to let him know. Waiter quickly exits the scene.

We wonder for a few minutes on what that was and decide that this is not the experience we want to give our money for. And thus we make our exit too.</text>

Average for the area but the area is very very good.

Atmosphere- 4 stars. Even though the rooftop deck in on the street, traffic sounds were low and trees in the area aw well as the building itself create a relaxing atmosphere. Dog friendly even though you have to walk through he restaurant to get to the deck.

Food. 3.5 stars.   The food was good.  We had Chicken Pesto Pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the chicken was tender.  The pesto cream sauce was rich but not oily.    They let us split the plate which was about perfect for lunch.

Service: 0 stars.  Servers were attentive and kind but I had an issue with my glass of wine.  I had an expensive glass of nice wine which I was nursing through dinner and had only had a couple of sips.

Near the end of dinner, a gust of wind flipped the table cloth up spilling my mostly full glass of wine.  I got a servers attention and told him what had happened and asked for some new napkins since ours were drenched in wine.  They  mopped up the wine with  the napkins but left a damp table and    didn't come back with new napkins.  They also didn't offer to comp or top off my glass.  That was a major fail.</Text>

<Review>Great menu and lovely outdoor seating on a second level patio surrounded by trees. The lamb shank curry was perfection! A family member had suggested a visit to Carmel when we were visiting the Monteray Bay Aquarium, and everything closer to the aquarium seemed more touristy and overpriced for the quality. I am SO glad we found this little gem a short drive south. I might visit the area again solely for another meal at the Treehouse Cafe!< /Review>< pictures>

This is our favorite place in Carmel and we always come visit. It has Italian, Thai, and Greek options (I know right?) And it does all of them amazingly! You can't go wrong with any dish here. The wine glasses also have generous pours hehe</text>

Great ambiance and literally the restaurant seems like a tree house on top of a tree stands just close that entrance. Must try their open space dine area which is an awesome experience.<//review>

Totally exceeded all of my expectations. The owner is very friendly and personable and they have the best wait staff I've ever seen in a restaurant. We got there on Saturday night without a reservation and a party of 6. We were told 10 minute wait but when it took a little longer they opened up the private wine room in the back for us. Alberto was our waiter and he was fantastic. He went above and beyond. We will most definitely be coming back every time we're in town.< /text>

Beautiful candle and snifters, ornaments, and other beautiful things for yourself or to give as gifts. They are connected to Sock Shop with many differant socks for the whole family, many differant materials like wool, cotton, and synthetic mixes, many styles and fun socks.  They also have a few special slippers for all, one pair softer than a bunny and very comfortable, baby socks for Christmas, running socks and fancy support socks.</text>

Great food, hats off to chef.

We got a feeling that the waiter was rude, most probably because we ordered fewer foods than usual.

But the food is so awesome I didn't want to give them four.< /review>

The food was mediocre. I ordered Thai Chicken Curry and send it back b/c it was overly sweet and overly spicy with a huge chunks of veggies. They did not charged us for that but later the charge showed up. The lamb chops were too thin to turn out medium rare and not so good. Mashed potatoes looked gray and starchy, Chicken Pesto Pasta was greasy in a pool of olive oil. Baklava was like from the store pastry dough. Service was excellent though and the ambience. Wish we never have gone there. :(< /text>

Lovely little restaurant in Carmel. If you love a British kebab then the Pita sandwich is pretty close. Otherwise, everything is top notch, gyros, lasagne, stroganoff, pasta etc.<//Review>

I first visited Treehouse Cafe because they were dog friendly. I return time and again for the unbelievable service. The staff treats you as family, is always happy to see you, and will do everything to make sure you have a great meal and a great time. Oh, and the food's good, too. Whether it's ribeye, paella, dolmas, or chocolate cake, I've always been happy.<//text>

< Review>
Very confusing restaurant. My family came as a party to eat up by the balcony and it was chaotic. Smoked salmon was raw without a description in the menus,meat wasn’t cooked, and servers weren’t helping and taking way to long to help, and way to pricey for something that shouldn’t be. And their paying system is too confusing and over exaggerated. I do not refer this place to you.< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Location is very nice, good service, good food. Too expensive, like everything else in Carmel. We were there at noon, it was very busy, but the staff had everything under control. Highly recommended, even if it was not quite enough for me with five stars.

(Original)
Location ist sehr nett, guter Service, gutes Essen. Bisschen zu teuer, wie alles in Carmel. Wir waren mittags dort, es war sehr trubelig, das Personal hatte aber alles gut im Griff. Durchaus zu empfehlen, auch wenn es bei mir nicht ganz für fünf Sterne reichte.<//Review><rating>4< /rating><gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005</gmap_id>< Date>
