Dirty, I havent been inside for a while due to the c19 there's been no point as everything has been takeout. Well today I went inside all the tables are blocked off floors are black and sticky, trash and debree from weeks of not cleaning. Dirty cardboard sanitizer station missing the sanitizer. Staff looks at you as you enter then runs and hides. I'm guessing they didn't know things are opening up and people will walk in and see the disaster.< /Text>

Forget about eating and delivering with this place! The employees were just straight up rude and some of them don’t speak english at all. That makes it impossible to communicate with each other. Absolutely lack of respect for customers and delivery drivers. If you’re thinking about craving fast food, I highly suggest going to another place that has a more professional customer service!<//Text>

Came at a time with no line. Pleasantly surprising because it was the first day with the Beyond Meat chicken available. Besides being a little rough, and a bit dry texture wise it's a win for me, a nice healthy crisp on the outside a well. Less carbs and much more protein is something I won't complain about especially when it tastes as good as this.<//Text>

<review>Pot pies are great.  People working there were snotty.  I asked about changing to a combo after paying and it was a huge fiasco.  They couldn't be bothered to do the math.  They just made up numbers and when  I challenged them, they were highly offended and let me know it.  If you want a good side of abuse with your meal, this is the place.<//review>< response>

Never had any probs with services and foods until yesterday. When mid-aged gentlemen were there, had no probs. Yesterday, 2 young ladies at the front, very rude. No greeting, first thing she told me was no credit card processing in the store otherwise I have to go drive-thru. Ok. So I ordered. I saw those 2 ladies never changed disposable gloves from hand out cash changes and then grab biscuits with same gloves! Did not use tongs!! One of my order, strips were not all the way cooked so I cooked them with my air fryer. I am not going back there until well trained employees and well done foods. Vary disappointed!!< /review>

We had the worst experience ever!!!! Got our food from drive through and came home found that they gave us only half of our chicken!!! Hungry kids and tired parents !!! Called back and asked them to sort it out but the manager “ Samantha” a young inexperienced lady was not willing to help!!!!surely the worst service ever! Disappointing and a shame Mr. Baker#<//Review>

I would normally give KFC a two star rating for their mediocre chicken and their horrible sides.  What brought it down to a one start is their chicken wings.  We thought we'd give them a try one day.  What a mistake.  Absolutely the worst wings I've ever had in my life.  We ended up throwing them out.  The coatings are more than the chicken, the meat is dry and old, and they actually include the wing tips, which are inedible.  KFC has gone way down in quality overall, but this experience has turned me away from ever going back.  I'm now on my search for a descent fried chicken place near me.< /Review>

The chicken was absolutely delicious you could tell it was fried fresh we bought the $20 bucket value and it was the tenders. However the only thing that was a disappointment where the biscuits they were hard as a rock they look like they overcooked them and then they weren't cooked fresh they might have been sitting awhile cuz they were extremely hard. Otherwise they would have gotten five stars. If something had to be bad in the order I'm glad it was the biscuits sad to say cuz we love their biscuits and we were glad that the chicken was top-notch.</Text>

It has been a while since I visited KFC .
Coming from Dana Point Harbor and in the mood for fried chicken. The navigation brought me for this KFC location.

What a big mistake and disappointment.
- First the bathrooms one is closed and the other is filthy..
- The gentlemen Hispanic at the register rood and is more interested in taxing on his cell phone.
- Hispanic music is so loud.
- Food is horrible..
- Seats are in bad shape.
What happened to KFC.. NO wonder why chick filet is so successful..
Do not recommend..Never again</text>

I love KFC because the workers are soooo helpfull and kind, friendly, and easy to talk to.  The food is fresh and tastes AMAZING!!!! Another reason is the bathrooms are very clean.<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>Overall I have had a good experience with KFC when  I dine in.  This is the second drive-thru incident I have had recently so I decided to write a review so hopefully management will address this issue and consistently repeat orders when they hand it to the customer at the drive-thru.  So this is what happened.  The guy at the drive-thru asked me if I wanted a biscuit with my order.  I told him yes.  When I pulled up I asked for two honey packets for my biscuit.  Got home and to my surprise there was no biscuit and no honey!!! One star because it was my fault for not checking for the biscuit after we discussed it twice.<//Review>< response>

Why haven’t I come here sooner???  So happy with nail trim and gland expression.  And such a great price!!  Debbie and the other young lady (didn’t catch her name!) put my little guy at ease during these stressful procedures.  Nails look clean cut and uniform, and I’m taking her word that the glands are empty. 😆 Definitely coming back for a full spa treatment soon!<//review>

I really like the service, my puppy comes smelling and looking so good! I don’t like how it is so hard to get a hold of this place, I have to call a lot of times in order to make an appointment. I call and call, they don’t answer.</Text>

Hit or miss on operating hrs and phone #. Sometimes she’s open, sometimes she’s not. Appointments are kept, so try it that way. She’s the owner and operator of her salon. I’ve been coming here for 7 years and she seldom has assistance, always does a great job, works quick and swift, never freaks my dogs out or keeps them hanging around and her prices are best in town.
Yeah, the phone number changes & sometimes there’s no one inside.  She commutes from TJ & gets stuck in a line sometimes, but she does a great job for cheap, so it evens out. Make an appointment like everywhere else you would go to in San Diego.

My dogs have been med-large, long hair working dogs.</review>

<Review>This is the only place my dog can get his nails trimmed, so far. Before he would get so scared at anyone trying to clip his nails. Here he doesn't make a fuss, that's why we come back.<//Review></record>

<Review>I Got an appointment last week for my dog for Monday at 3:00pm. I was very excited because I read good reviews, and my only day off is Monday and normally all groomers that I found in San Diego do not work on Mondays. I arrived with my dog on time and it was closed. No one called me to cancel the appointment, (and they took my phone number)  I am very dissapointed they didn't respect my time. I have lot of errands and things to do on Mondays, so I  have to take my dog back home and start over again searching for a groomer.< /Review>< Pictures>

Thank you Bebby For your kindness and understanding today. Thank you for the fantastic job you did on Rocky. Thank you for taking Rocky on short notice. Thank you for the discount and paying it forward. My Aunt was so happy with the job you did on Rocky. She said he looked like a "puppy" again. That he looked fabulous. Thank you again.</text>

<Review>Here's the fact. They are very thorough I put a brand new air filter in my vehicle before I went there and they checked it I wanted to see if they would say you need one they said you do not need one it looks really good they took care of my vehicle very quickly and I got a free $23 car wash so my bill was actually only about $38 nice place and the car wash next door does a super job and no I don't work there< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>Can't get a better oil change anywhere! Management is too notch and the place is a gem. Better than that you can get a wash right next door after you get the oil done! Do your car right and visit  soon.</Text>< Date>

Going to be doing oil changes myself.  I went in with my 2013 Ford Escape, got the oil change, did not drive my car Sunday, went to work Monday, and when I walked out of work I saw my splash pan was hanging down about an inch off the ground.

That Friday, they did put it back on but the managers excuse was, it's because the vehicle has over 100k miles.  Their carwash there is real good, the oil change place.  Not going back again.</Text>

When i went in bright and early, I had realized i didnt have my debit card and was $8.00 short to pay for my total.

The manager Paul said it was ok and let it go!
Happy Tuesday to me!
Not only did he say it was ok but my car got its usual cleaning. So im a happy camper!

Go in & enjoy their cool lobby while you wait on your wheels!< /review>

California can be a confusing state in terms of protocol and it's regulations regarding registering a vehicle from out of state.  QVV company was so helpful and reliable on delivery of service and on informing what the next steps to fulfil was.  Their quality of customer service and professionalism deserves every bit of this 5 star rating.  I highly recommend their services to anyone in the dark or in need of navigating VIN registration/verification.  I'm not quite sure what other services they provide, but, if your needs fall into their other categories, I can say with full confidence, this company will not disappoint.  Best of luck!</text>

When Darrell showed up I did not know what to expect but he was so professional and knowledgeable that he put me at ease and made the process so easy that all I had to do was show him the car and he handled the rest. He was easy to talk to and it was done quickly. Thank you so much Darrell!!!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I am a nationwide Fleet Manager and am always filtering vehicles in and out of CA. Darrell is my go-to VIN verifier! He is always on time and quick! He provides a courtesy call when he is on his way and squeezes me into his schedule as much as possible. He’s easy to talk to and easy to work with. I appreciate the consistency especially since I have limited time. Thank you Darrell!< /Review>< Name>

I was very pleased with quick Vin verification service they came out the same day and the representative spent much time making sure I was clear my documents were correct and any questions I had he was happy to enlighten me he was very professional prompt and very helpful. I would highly recommend them to anyone their price was reasonable and all I had to do was be on site at the time agreed it was easy peasy so do yourself a favor and get ahold of them if you need your VIN verified and they'll take good care of you thank you so much quick Vin you rock!</text>

<Review>Service was done quickly and on time. I am disappointed with the lack of correct communication. While scheduling the appointment, registration services were offered and I asked a few questions and I was given the impression that I would be able to utilize registrations services as well as VIN verification on the same visit. The service provider was aware of the state the vehicle was coming from, aware of the type of vehicle and was aware further documentation regarding the weight of the vehicle would be required to complete any registration but failed to tell me until meeting at the appointment. I really feel as if I wasted $100 and truthfully feel robbed. I feel as registration service providers, the least that could have been done was asking if I had the proper documentation for weight of the vehicle before the appointment was scheduled.< /Review>< pictures>

True professional company. Responded almost immediately to my quote request ! Unlike couple other Vin Verification companies I contacted who did not even bother responding back at all. The process was quick &  cost was really reasonable. Darrell was on time, friendly & professional. I would recommend this company for your Vin Verification. Oh yea they came to me which was additional bonus for me.. Thank you Darrell!< /Text>

I am definitely going to recommend this company, they're so easy to work with even the initial call in. I waited maybe 20 seconds before I talked to a real human, which is always nice. I scheduled my appointment and and was booked to get my vin verification. I recieved a call the day before my scheduled appointment. Darrell Hunter was my verifier, he was on time and really nice to work with. His customer service skills were were exactly what companies need nowadays. Cool, Calm, and Collected, if I ever need a vin verification I am 100% sure that I will be calling Quick Vin Verification again.

Professional, Knowledgeable, and Super Fast!

We've been using Quick Auto for a while now and they and their staff have grown without and with good reason! All very knowledgeable and ready to assist with anything I've bought them including odd ball out of state titles with recordation issues.

Registration cost always seems a bit cheaper than expected too which is a nice surprise every time.  I have a AAA membership and I've been thinking of cancelling since Quick Auto beats them in EVERY way (speed, availability, and in the range of registration services that they can perform).

I've been referring friends here and every one of them is amazed at how fast and easy their registration is. Makes me feel like I'm letting them in on an awesome secret. Can't recommend them highly enough!!</review>

< review>
I want to thank the staff from Quick Vin Verifications for coming thru for me, as I needed to have my custom build motorcycle information verified for the DMV since I was unable to take the bike myself. Quick Vin Verifications stepped in and came out to the shop where my bike is being worked on and performed exactly what I needed to satisfy the DMV requirements for me to get a new title and registration. Thanks again to the Quick Vin Verification company.
Sincerely a happy customer: Peter J.<//review>

What a great service!!!

They took the frustration out of dealing with the DMV. I would not only recommend Quick Vin Verification, I will be using them again for any used vehicle or trailer purchases that need Vin Verification. If you don’t want to go to there location in Riverside, they send someone out within 24 hours to your home or business for an additional charge based on your location, totally worth it. Time is money, Awesome!! Never again will I spend 2-3 hours at the DMV for this.

Thank you for a great service!!!!</Text>

<Review>Had to register my out of state truck and with the DMV closed, this has made it very difficult to do. I ended up buy a AAA membership but when I went in to get the vin verified by  Quick Vin before heading to AAA, they told me they could handle the entire transaction. I probably paid more having Quick Vin do it, but I was done in 30 minutes and Noelle took excellent care of me. I am totally cool with paying more for amazing service and saving time!</Review>< pics>

<review>These people are amazing. They saved me a trip to the DMV and got my new plates/registration done in just a few minutes. I had to pay a fee as a new customer to skip the DMV ($75) but it was totally worth it. The VIN verification was much cheaper than anywhere else, so it evened out. Great people.

If you have tried to register a vintage car in California you know how that can go...they have made it next to impossible...
I made a call to Uni at Quick Auto Tags, made an appointment for him to come to my house about 70 miles from his office. He
showed up on time, was extremely professional, finished his work in a timely manner, emailed me my new registration the same day, two days later l had my new tags, license plates and registration delivered to house.
Was the price too high?
Not when you consider the time, cost of trailering the car, not to mention the time and anxiety of local DMV.
Have an old car you need registered? Call Uni..l recommend him highly!!</Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1575942264210, 'text': 'I appreciate your review and your business.. thank you'}< /Resp><text>I purchased a horse trailer in TX back in June and when my license plates didn't arrive I contacted DMV Sacramento.  I was told that the dealership would need to cancel my registration and resubmit and this could take up to 60 days.  Unfortunately I needed to travel out of state with my trailer on the 16th.  Part of the discrepancy was when purchasing any out of state vehicle it must obtain a VIN verification certificate.  After receiving a few quotes and no one available the same day, I contacted Quick Tags and they were more than accommodating.  I received a same day evening appointment.  Upon the arrival of the verifier he noted that my registration was coded improperly and stated that Uni may be able to assist me.  The next day I was contacted by Uni, he went over a few things and said he would get back to me.  As promised he contacted me within a couple hours and said he had good news.  Not only did I not have to pay the additional $461 DMV was requesting, he was able to correct the issue and my DMV charge was only $22 plus their services.  It was amazing, it took less than 24hrs to fix and I didn't have to do anything.  Uni and the other employees at Quick Tags deserve a thumbs up for their professionalism and going the extra mile to assist their clients.  Thanks guys!!!<//text>< gmap_id>

Easy access,  easy drive up And convenient hours. What a great place.  Met with the part time manager she was great, she helped us with picking the perfect size. Loved the attention to detail and she talked about the do's and dont's to store. Amazing personality.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Absolutely awful all around!! The location is perfect but the actual storage facility is disgusting. There’s no security cameras anywhere besides the entrance of the property, which was a huge red flag for me. My fiancé and I drove 60+ hours with a 18 month old with a trailer carrying all of our belongings, and they knew this. We were supposed to have a “drive up” storage unit. We paid for a drive up storage unit and we wouldn’t be arriving until after the location would be closed and they also knew this. When we arrived there was no map anywhere to show you how to actually get to your unit. We drove around for 30 minutes looking for our unit and there were no unit numbers close to what our unit number was. Turns out they LIED and did not give us a drive up unit, instead, we had to walk through 3 doors with no windows. Just an all around horrible situation because at 9 at night and no security cameras it honestly feels like someone could easily attack you and rob, kidnap you VERY easily. We never found the storage unit because the email they sent to show us our unit never included any kind of directions or map for the unit numbers. You literally cannot figure out how they decided to number the units because it’s a mess. It makes no sense. So we ended up not even being able to remove our belongings into our unit until the next day which was not our original plan.
We spoke with the management and they didn’t even care that we didn’t get what we purchased when it came to the drive up part, they also didn’t care that we didn’t feel safe. We were very busy and ONE week went by before we got a new storage unit from a different AMAZING facility 20 minutes away. They refused to refund us or give us a month credit or any kind of accommodation for all the mistakes that were made on THEIR part. Absolutely terrible place. They’re rude and inconsiderate. They take hours long lunch breaks while you’re sitting in their unlocked office just waiting. There is no such thing as customer service with Public Storage!!! Do not go here unless you just don’t care about your belongings. They’re not liable if anything is stolen or if something happens to you on their property. Someone has been shot there before and they don’t even disclose this information with you or care about your safety while using their facility.</text>< Pics>

Devon is stellar. My goodness I’ll recommend this location to everyone. I had such a crummy situation feeling so insecure with my unit being unlocked while I was out of state. Thank goodness for Devon and their keen communication between myself and the overseers to make sure my unit and peace of mind were both secure. Not mention he’s been helpful from day one and counting. Thank you guys. Highly recommend this location. All star service.</Review>

Greg was so incredibly helpful and made the process of renting painless. He was knowledgeable of all things and even advised me of a safe way to enter the property without getting out of my car!  Kudos to GREG!!!<//Text>

Julio is such a sweetheart! He went over the entire contract with me before I signed anything, and told me exactly what was going to be coming out of my account so I knew what to expect on the 1st of every month. The units are really nice, and the customer service is great! It also helps that they are all good looking too :P
Definitely a place you can trust that your valuable things will be in good hands! Plus, it’s cheap< /Review>

Hadn't been in to check my stuff in a long time - the young man who helped me was awesome.  He walked me to my unit, as I had forgotten where it was.  I am glad he did, as the lock was almost impossible to open.  (I wish I could remember his name!)  So he went and got another while I waited at the unit.  Such a helpful and great guy with such good manners.  A rare bird in day to day interactions, that is for sure!</Review>

Justin was amazing and attentive. He seemed quite busy but still made the time to explain everything to me very  thoroughly and answer all my questions. I trust leaving my extremely important belongings here because Justin made me feel very comfortable with the facility and those who run it. The facility was clean and the prices were very reasonable!! Thank you Justin!<//Review>

<Text>In all my years of renting storage (that would be like 100 years)... my experience with Greg, Devon, Julio and Justin at the Moorpark location has been the best storage experience in all of my history! Not only are they all professional and maintain the property top notch, they care about their customers and make personal/professional phone calls if anything is awry! I love, love my temperature controlled storage at Moorpark Storage. Thanks to all of you!< /Text>< pics>

Tracy and Justin are the absolute best!  Both have gone out of their way to be accomodating and help me select the best storage unit for my specific needs... and then alerted me to a short time frame where I could save 50% on my monthly fees!  (Labor Day Promotion) Highly recommend!!!<//review>

<Review>storage was clean service was exceptional.  i cant give 5 because i was told i needed to bring or buy a lock from them.  i asked how much locks were.  they didnt tell me i had to have a specific type of lock.  it must be a cylindrical lock.  also it worked out for me but when you lock in and reserve a price for a specific unit.. if you wait too long that unit might be sold.  i would definetly reccomend public storage</Review><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

Justin was a tremendous help to us today!  Kevin is a great addition to the PS staff, too.  We are continuing customers, and we needed to consolidate our stored items into a larger drive-up unit.  Justin made the transaction easy and then stood ready to assist us getting everything done in a day.  Wonderful customer service! You have earned our respect and our continuing business.  We highly recommend (this) Public Storage!!
People make the difference!</Text>

This is such a great facility with the BEST people working for them.  I just got a new unit and had the friendliest person help me: DALLAS.  She was very informative and helpful.  She took me for a tour of the property and gave me some great moving tips along the way. Thanks Dallas for such a great experience.  I would definitely recommend coming to this storage facility!</Review>

What a wonderful place, i pulled up and was already impressed with how clean the property was. I went inside and i was just inquiring about a space for me and my families stuff, Robert was the first person to greet me and i felt welcomed. Both Julio and Robert were very very knowledgeable Robert explained everything and even went thru the process of even showing me a space or two!!! Robert you rock.

I definately will be back to rent my space here at this location.

Friendly staff
Knowledgeable
Go out of thier way.

Great job Robert and Julio....< /Review>

<Text>Terrible experience! Public Storage uses cost shifting to account for seasonal fluxes. This means that if you been a loyal customer, your rate will continually increase each year for no reason. If you rent the smallest unit and have been renting for years, you can end up paying the same amount for a unit that is quadruple the size. I started renting a unit a couple of years ago for 135 dollars per month, and have now realized I am paying 210 dollars for the same unit. My same unit is advertised online for 120 dollars per month for new members. Public Storage will use whatever scheme they can to continue overcharging members. When you inquire about your account, you will be given a blanket answer about how corporate sets the rates and they have little authority to assist the customer. The management at the Moorpark unit is absolutely awful, unhelpful and straight rude. Justin should get a new job because he does not belong in customer service. Public Storage has unethical business practices.< /Text><date>1549762646844<//date><rating>1<//rating><userid>113931499989427983883<//userid>< pictures>

<text>Dave the property manager was great. When we first arrived we had doubts about the travel time to the facility. Dave went immediately to the computer to find another available space. While he was doing that we asked him some questions about the facility. One of our concerns and the main reason we were seeking a storage unit was the recent wildfires in our area. Dave informed us that the Moorpark structure was a concrete and steel design.That tid bit of info and his helpful demeanor sealed the deal. It may be a few more minutes drive time but we feel this facility is a secure choice...< /text>< pics>

Went to Public Storage today and dealt with Ryan. He was very helpful, along with being able to answer all of our questions. Even appreciated that on his lunch, he opened the door for us to get some boxes we purchased but weren't able to fit in the car earlier. Thanks again!< /text>

Colin was very responsive and made the whole rental process a breeze. He answered any questions and explained everything so there was no "sticker shock" or hidden fees. I would recommend Public Storage in Moorpark to anyone needing quick storage for a move or other circumstance.<//review>

Christy was super friendly and provided us with excellent service. I have been shopping around and had just general info given to me in other storage places. Christy on the other hand blew me away, she walked us to our unit, opened and showed us our space. Amazing service I left extremely happy with what I was looking for.</text>

<response>None<//response><name>Marie Lorenz< /name><Text>I love the service at this company! I walked in and didn't really greet which sounds bad but was under a lot of stress and just going after my need which was pricing storage places in an hour at different locations and I asked the guy Justin when I walked in what's it cost for your biggest storage? He told me 3 storage sizes with 3 prices and immediately took me to see them. I had shopped online also couple days prior so I knew prices were fair. The guy was just so kind and told me about the discount on boxes for a bundle and any I don't use I could bring back and get credit, I liked that .This was my second storage facility I checked within the hour, and the guy told me about the hours here of operation and I decided to go for it! Way cool guy, very honest man, so I got my storage based on conveniance, storage hours and Justins customer service!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

recently moved and I see public storages everywhere. I decided to go to the moorpark property to see what kind of money I would have to spend for a unit. Not only did justin answer all my questions but he made me feel comfortable with paying for a untit every month. I felt my things would be safe on the property and I felt that the staff actually cares about their customers. Highly recomend</Text>

This place is mediocre at best. It seems everyone wants a speedy service. I prefer to have them take a minute to prep the area.
I found prepping the area with baby powder as well as applying a soothing gel post-threading is beneficial. I don't have sensitive skin but broke out in small bumps.
I also have never had to request for the finishing touch- the scissor trim on the beginning area of my eyebrows. Here, I had too.
Overall, the shape of my eyebrows were fairly done. Two stars because prepping the area is half the service.<//text>

I have been coming here for three years now and can’t imagine going anywhere else to get my eyebrows done! This place is very clean and professional even throughout the entire Covid-19 pandemic. Carol is very kind and attentive to detail so you can rest assured you will come out looking great. I have never been unsatisfied with any of the services done here. If there was ever anything I wanted to be touched up again I just kindly mentioned it and it gets fixed the way I want it. My sisters come here as well and they also feel confident they will get a great service here whenever we come! Best place to come to in the AV. Highly recommend it. Thank you for the consistency and accuracy in work!<//review>

My name is Matthew. I went to Carol and had such an amazing experience. She was fast and her facilities were CLEAN! She made me feel comfortable even though it was my first time threading and she even does eyebrow slits!! She trimmed too cool lines into my left eyebrow and my girlfriend LOVES IT. I highly recommend her services and will continue to go to her and refer my friends.<//review>

This is the absolute best place in the Antelope Valley to get your eyebrows threaded. She always makes them look even and perfect. Also if you want your chin or upper lip(cuz ladies let's be honest) this is a great place for that too. She also does hair cuts and eyebrow and eyelash tinting. Her shop is very clean everytime I go in. I love that she has big windows in her shop so it is very well lit with natural lighting. It's very bright in there which is something you'd want because she can see all the hairs on her clients face and remove what needs to be gone. I've been to other eyebrow threading places that dont work in bright natural lighting and while I'm inside the shop their work doesnt look too bad but then I go outside i see lots of hairs and peach fuzz they've missed. I've never had any problems like that here So I only go to Precision eyebrow threading because I'm always satisfied. She's super nice and understanding and she always let's you check out her work before leaving the chair so if you'd like more hair gone or see any places shes missed shes very kind and will take off what you want. If you dont live in Lancaster its definitely worth it to come here because I always make the drive for my eyebrows and wouldn't change it not even with these gas prices. When I say THE BEST PLACE in the AV I really mean it.<//review>

<text>The only place I trust to thread my eyebrows. The results is always amazing and I’ve been coming here for 2 years. I recently started getting henna too which adds a nice tint to my brows and lasted longer than expected. Definitely make an appointment, she’s a one woman show and can get very busy due to the holidays coming up and the pandemic. Best place in the AV for threading.< /text><userid>101398409872056785712</userid><gmap_id>0x80c25ae37e817a13:0x5600c04deba4f4de<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Like everyone else said she is very quick!! I was surprised and anxious because I felt I was taking a risk by going to someone new...don't we all? Anyways I love them and it was a big deal for me because I been growing them out for 7 months and didn't wanna have to go through an awkward stage again. #eyebrowthreaded<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>She’s always busy back to back, sometimes doesn’t even get a lunch break & is on her feet all day. Tip her well because she’ll make you feel so beautiful at the end of it all. Best eyebrow threader in all of the AV, well worth the wait.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Literally so rude. I came here and she didn’t even greet me she told me to stand outside, and while I was standing outside for No reason I had to ask if appointment was required and she said “yea you need an appointment”. She could’ve said that in the beginning but instead had me outside for no reason, never greeted me and said hello, just to stand outside. What a joke! I’ll be telling everyone in the AV to stay away from here. Horrible service< /Text>

Thought I has finally found my go to person to get my eyebrows done. First time was a great experience. Today, not so great. I called but there was no answer. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a text a few minutes later asking what I could be helped with. I inquired if they had any availability as I had just gotten off work and had an event to go to shortly after. Was told I could be seen and to come over. I arrive and wait patiently as there are two people ahead of me and no one after me. I wait about 25mins and 2 other girls arrive. Once my turn comes up I go in and tell her I had texted her for my eyebrow threading only to be told that I will be seen only if her appointments no show.

Completely wasted my time by not clarifying that via text and expecting me to wait "if" there is an opening that may or may not pop up. Just lost my sister and I as I will make sure to tell her not to bother anymore.< /review>

I moved from LA and came across this place, i went twice, each time was an exceptional experience, the younger lady did amazing work each time. Now just this Friday I went and an older woman was there, it didn't bother me, I didn't walk in because i seen a sign saying 1 customer at a time, so i stood outside, WITH MY MASK ON and the older woman saw me and instead of acknowledging me and letting me know how they were doing things, she closed the door on my face, never said a word to me, & walked away,mind you i never even walked inside, SHE WAS VERY RUDE. ill never ever come here again. Very unprofessional.<//Text>

Precision Eyebrow lady is one amazing human being. I absolutely love coming to get my eyebrows and sometimes my upper lips done by her. She is caring,  patient, accommodating, and knowledgeable at her work. She listens to her clients and does an outstanding job. She doesn’t just do eyebrows, upper lips, she also does sideburns, entire face, waxing, facial and even haircuts. I would definitely recommend her services.<//text>

Carol is amazing! She does my eyebrows perfectly every time. Even on her busiest days there is barely a wait, I’ve maybe had to wait 20 mins at most? And she finishes quickly as well :) She is very sweet, I recommend getting your eyebrows done here!< /Review>

I'm very picky about who and what touches my face, I messed my eyebrows up my self smh. Huge mess, So i let them grow back fully for about 2 months and went to her after reading some reviews. best choice I made. I absolutely love the way she shaped and lined them. she was so gentle and on point. friendly and positive and inviting. I felt very welcome. I will be back every 2 weeks from now on . look no more for perfection. shell have you looking and feeling good.< /review>

<review>First time going into the place I was greeted by Carol, she was friendly with the clients she was assisting and I really like that, made a good initial impression. Then my turn came I asked for the eyebrow waxing and upper lip threading, mind to say I am a pretty picky client lol well she did well above my expectations, she was professional, clean and listens to what the customer wants. I left very happy and
of course I’ll be another regular customer of Carol. :D</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Carol is so professional and sweet! She makes sure you get what you want. It's hard to find someone you can trust with your brows that won't make them too thin or uneven.

<review>I love this place! Carol is the most sweetest and friendliest woman. She is so delicate and takes her time. She does not rush through the process, even if she has people waiting. She will make sure you are satisfied and feel comfortable with her work. She is a true artist! The prices are also very reasonable. The store is always so clean and relaxed. If you haven't seen Carol for your waxing and threading services, I recommend you head over there ASAP! (:</review>< Gmap_id>

BEST service ever, great customer service, friendly and welcoming Carol always makes sure your happy before leaving her chair. Carol is absolutely the BEST in the Av! Eyebrows start off at only $10, very well worth it! If you’re looking for a threading salon this is the place to go highly recommend it! I never leave disappointed from here, she is an amazing artist.<//Review>

<text>My Favorite eye brow place to go to! If you are in a rush you can make a appointment before hand or just wait in the chairs they have. It's a very small place but we'll kept. I've only been with the one lady that is there all the time and she is so Nice! Great customer service!! I Do recommend going weekdays because they raise price up about a dollar or 2 on weekends because it gets so busy for her.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Can't say enough about this place. Walk ins are welcome, you just have to wait a short while to squeeze in between appointments. Threading is $11, I believe, and it takes less than 10 minutes. My brows have come out perfect every time.< /Review>< UserId.>

<Review>I have been coming to Precision Eyebrow for about 6 months now and I am so happy that I found this place. The reason why this place is so special is because of Carol, the sweet lady that works here. She is always so kind and welcoming. She does fantastic work and is so attentive in making sure she gives you what you want. I have not been disappointed by any work that she has done. I always leave a happy customer and always come back with a smile on my face, just because of her. Carol makes sure that you are happy with the work she has done, and if you are unhappy, she will be sure to find a solution. She cares more about your happiness and customer service rather than the money. I refer all of my friends to her if they need any waxing or threading services done.
The one negative review that the woman left is inaccurate. Please do not take what she said into consideration if you are thinking of coming here. Carol will NOT let you down or take off a "chunk'" of your eyebrows.  You will be so happy that you chose her for the services you want. You will NOT be disappointed! :)

Just to let other customers know- there is a $1 charge for any credit card transaction. There is a blatant sign on the desk stating this. If you want to avoid this fee, pay with cash. :)</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Awesome work!  Carol is a perfectionest.  She take her time and makes sure you are satisfied with her work before you leave.
I found her about a year ago and won't go anywhere else.  I am always referring her to friends and family.<//Review>

Terrible!!! I went there today friday november 17th.. First the lady rushed through my eyebrows. She did it in about 3 minutes and less. Then at first she told me it was 10$ . Then she told me it was 11$. I didnt argue because it is only a dollar. Then i get in the car and I just realized she took a chunk off the top of my eyebrows off. Please dont come here. I shouldve went with my gut feeling and went to Perfect Eyebrow Threading like i usually do off of J and 30th. Terrible smh...<//Review>

<review>Carol is such an amazing caring person I am so happy to have met her♥️ For over a year I have had to deal with my eyebrows GONE REALLY WRONG from shape to color 😧 I intended to have microblading done on my eyebrows I ended up with tattooed fill in eyebrows and to top it off, BLACK color was used 😔I was devastated until I kinda got used to them.... Today I was looking to thread my eyebrows the lady I usually go to was closed I have a photoshoot tomorrow so I googled and found PRECISION EYEBROW THREADING on Ave K west next to Autozone and carol was so concerned at the way my eyebrows looked after I shared my bad experiences with her, she kindly offered to do a COLOR CORRECTION on me for FREE the first time just to try and see if it helps lightening the dark out of my eyebrows AND RESULTS ARE AMAZING!!!🙏🏼♥️My eyebrows even look shaped!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR GREAT CARING HEART CAROL!!!!

Ps HER HAND IS SO LIGHT THREADING DOESNT EVEN HURT! 😜I Strongly Recommend PRECISION EYEBROW THREADING 1248 w Ave k in Lancaster!

Shortly after that I decided to add a few more skeins to my order and called the store. My yarn was already being packaged for shipping and they quickly adjusted my billing and included the extra skeins. It was picked up by USPS the same day and the yarn was in my hands within 48 hours! Delivered from California to Minnesota in 48 hours! Couldn’t be happier with their customer service, competitive prices, cute llama shipping bag and of course the yarn!</Text>< Pics>

Heartstrings is a world class yarn store with neighborhood heart! Amazing yarn selection and knowledge.  Low key; don’t get the feeling of any pressure. Went in looking to find yarn to match some no-name homespun that I had and got exceptional advice on yardage, weight and fiber matches.  Michelin three star award means "exceptional [cuisine], worth a special journey". If you’re a knitter, Heartstrings is worth a special journey.</text>

< Review>
I came in because my dog ate my circular needles and I needed help salvaging my project.  Laura (a different Laura) got me set up with a new set of needles and back on track with  my project.  Being new to the area I'm thrilled to find  Heartstrings.  They carry everything a knitter could want at a fair price and are knowledgeable and helpful.<//Review>

<Review>Not a knitter, but the wife is! I've been to plenty of stores with her of course. And this one was huge! Just keep going back and back. Tons of variety and she had tons of problems finding something to get, because there were so many choices!< /Review><Date>1547926864318</Date>< username>

beautiful park, clean I mean no litter anywhere.  the bathrooms were clean there was water on cement which is good so that everyone pays attention I impress with the bathrooms.  there is a grass field  on the other side there is a dog park, nice one very much kept up.  I have already meet 3 dog owners and their pets.  beautiful dogs all the area the teenage are playing hoops or just sitting listing music.  then they  have side for the small children  all quite and having fun.  last but important well lite all the poles had no burnt bulbs.  that itself is a big plus.< /Review>

I live 1/4 mile from this park.  When in the park was being planned, I attended some of the community input meetings.  Total cost, over 2 million dollars.  I'ts been open for maybe 2 years now, and already it's gone to sh*t.  Overgrown and filled with weeds.  (See photos. )Maybe they could have spent a little less and saved some money for maintenance?<//Text>

<Text>On our way back to Oregon we heard about, and visited, the Andy Lopez Community Park. We saw the beautiful and heartfelt monument. Very impressive. The park was so well designed and inviting. My friend, who lives in Santa Rosa, did not know the story behind it and was really glad to get the history. Coincidentally, Andy's little cousins were hanging around the memorial and engaged us.  What a great and empowering message to the community.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>You know those skateparks you see on youtube from New York? They're like a small   dog run with ramps for skaters but they're awesome . It's like a holy elbow of skateboarding fun. Flows beautifully into the trees and nature and it has a community farm , kid park and soccer field  along with the skatepark.<//text>< Pictures>

It's a nice park although very new and the trees are still very small. There's not much shade. BBQ grills, skate park and nice grass to chill out on. Also a dog area.< /text>

Grew up in this area. This used to be an open field where people would throw trash and us kids would try and explore. Its wonderful that they built this beautiful park in memoriam for a wonderful human.< /review>

Food was delicious worth the price, relaxing ambiance. Tonight they had live music, absolutely amazing. I don’t know the females name but she had blue eyes and she had great customer service skills, and was very attentive. Friendly atmosphere! Could hardly wait to visit again 👍<//Review>

<Text>This place does not thrill me.  Food is okay but not worth the money.  Disco montage played while dining gets my wife bouncing and happy, but again no value for that amount of money.  Ceviche I ordered was very fresh and good.<//Text><userid>114984790864486040998</userid>< pictures>

Decent place for Mexican food. I stoped by for drinks and apps. Their tortilla chips were not the best to be honest, guacamole was delish!

Ordered Mango blended Margarita as well.<//review>

<review>Over priced for fair food and service. Gratuity of 18% automatically added to your bill is a bit bold for parties less than six. Will not return or recommend.<//review>< name>

Excellent food, drinks and service! All staff were friendly, attentive and professional. Food came out quickly and had large serving size. We ordered guacamole, combination platter and fish tacos. The speciality margaritas were very fresh and delicious. Will definitely go back to eat again. Great atmosphere for date night or time out with friends.<//review>

< Review>
It is an awesome place to have lunch or dinner. In my last visit I was in the outdoor seating. The staff is very professional, wonderful customer service, for real! They servers and host are always taking care or everything you may need. I was doing my job while waiting for my delicious fish tacos accompanied with a red sangria, and to be honest I didn't wait long! They serve my drinks and food very fast, the food was very tasty. I loved it. I widely recommend this place with the extended/expanded outdoor seating for the safety of the customers. Ah! Staff members are well protected for COVID safety guidelines!</Review>

There was a time when the food was edible. But now it seems there only interest is to sell you ever cheap product they have got leftover in the kitchen and charge you twice the price as their competitor across the street. I used to be a loyal patron but I have seen nothing but a downward spiral and they won’t ever get my business again and all I can say is I’m sorry for the waiters because I’ve always given them 20% but now I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone i like< /text>

< Review>
Went there on a Saturday night May/2021 and this place has horrible customer service. It might of just been one waiter but still give the place a bad impression. The chips were hard and they did not give us salsa until asked a different waiter. Our waiter tended to people that got there after us first. The food is mediocre at best. $23 for two taco platter at least they could make some authentic tacos and authentic Mexican rice. They get away with it because of the location.<//Review>

<Review>So happy they opened a location on the promenade. Your happy hour menu is pretty great and they have some very good drink choices on there too. Whenever I get the three taco happy hour special it’s always enough definitely a great place for a date or just hanging out with friends the Papi Chulo margarita is my favorite drink</Review>< Pics>

The fajitas were tasty but a bit dry. The
Margarita was too strong in my opinion. Chicken taco a bit tasteless.

Our waiter was in a rush and didn’t help us at all with the menu.

Love the food, not the experience. Our first visit on Halloween was good except that the music was deafening. The second time we ordered online and were called by the restaurant asking whether we were on our way to pick up the order because they planned on closing early. This time we ordered through the link on their website again (2 hours before closing according to the website), received an order confirmation and a time for pick up and then found the restaurant closed when we arrived. Please update your hours or find some way to let your customers know when you've closed early</review>

I’m here for the first time, it looks great and they have Mariachi Playing today, so I said to my self why not go and take a bite...
The hostess  walking to a duty table when there were more empty tables for two, she said lets wait so someone can clean the table ( hello !! there is one clean and ready for customers and one more over there)
The waitress come and ask me if I like a drink, so I ordered it and chips and salsa come and my drink to.... ( why is it that you will need with chips and salsa.... yes napkins) so I ask the waitress for napkins and ... right there you could sense her .....< /Text>

<Text>Check price before you order. It’s very expensive and the food is also not good at all. Plus they charge service fees(18%) and then expect tip on top of that.</Text>< Pics>

The food was average, long serving time and the beer not very cold! The staff is forthcoming and polite, they are over the value of the restaurant offer.I wouldn't recommend unless there's no alternative<//review>

Just had dinner here. Worst service ever! The waiter came around to our table a total of maybe 3 times. My bf and I ordered water to drink with our meals as soon as the waiter heard that he seemed uninterested in serving us. Our chips were burnt to begin with. I asked for a straw at the beginning of our order and didn’t get it until they brought our tab out. Everyone who was ordering alcoholic beverages seemed to be getting good service. To top it all off the food wasn’t even that good. Definitely NOT authentic Mexican food and WAY over priced. First and last time visiting this restaurant.</review>

Food is way overpriced, NOT authentic, and tastes bland. Went with my fiance and the only thing she remotely enjoyed was the tortilla of the burrito. Salsa was bland, chips were bland. I normally don't even write reviews but they've earned it.< /text>

<review>Just purchased a car from Kyle and it was a very smooth process. (Guess he wanted to get me in and out before the check engine light came back on)Took it for a test drive, went over the features and car services records(except the records for both catalytic converters being bad), then Kyle gave me a great price! (Considering the catalytic converters cost 4k to fix) The paperwork took less time than expected. Kyle took care of the DMV paperwork too. (Even assured me I didn't need the 200 day purchase insurance) If anyone I know is ever in the market to buy a car, I would NOT send them his way.</review><Gmap_id>0x809adb7b32f465b9:0x795ec094002eb117<//Gmap_id>< response>

Awesome experience. Even better price. Great customer service. Experience was quick, so quick I got it the day I crashed my other car. The car was in perfect condition. Clean inside and out. Great selection to choose from. Also helped me get a smart decision. The all electric was amazing. Never going to a gas station for gas again is the absolute best. Also got a car in my favorite color. Highly recommended to all my family and friends.< /Review>

Keith was absolutely amazing!!!
Honest, trustworthy, and transparent. Couldn't ask for a better car buying experience. Seeing how I never leave reviews or at least positive ones this should speak volumes about the customer service you receive at CarSight. Thank you for helping me find the perfect vehicle and giving me the peice of mind to feel comfortable in a new purchase.<//text>

The guys were MOST helpful in facilitating the purchase of my daughter’s first car.  Even went the extra mile to take it to a friend to test drive for us, since I’m not living in the area.  They were responsive and respectful and made it easy to communicate with over text.  My daughter says they were “super nice” at delivery and that’s much appreciated!  The car is running well and seems to have been represented honestly.</Text>

<Review>Keith was awesome! What we really appreciated about him was that he didn’t make us feel like he just wanted to make a deal. Through our first interaction we had, he had professionalism and integrity in his business which we greatly appreciate! The transaction was easy and smooth. Would definitely recommend CarSight for a used car dealership!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809adb7b32f465b9:0x795ec094002eb117<//gmap_id></record>

I don't normally leave reviews but these guys worked for it.  The crew at CarSight made me feel welcomed and made the whole process painless. They searched for the type of truck I wanted within my budget, discuss our goals and go over options available.  Finally found a beautiful 2019 vehicle with a warranty.  Very happy camper. Thanks Keith and Michael! 👌🏼</text>

Kyle and the crew are amazing.  They always come through in the clutch.  My grandson wrecked his car that we bought from Kyle and he delivered us a Nissan leaf the same day. The price was right and he brought it to us.  Only place to buy a used car.</Text>

I was looking for a 2014 Chevy Volt and knew how much I could spend. I gave them my price and they found me a perfect car. Low miles in excellent condition and perfect running order. Michael did everything he could to make it happen !! I appreciate how hard he worked.</Text>

Grateful for these awesome, dependable folks. Keith put a lot of labor and time into making sure I left the lot with a dependable and affordable vehicle, helping me feel informed every step of the way. Carsight is a fabulous example of how local small business can go above and beyond in building trust and support between seller and buyer. Thanks Carsight, Keith, and Ken for the helpful service!</Review>

<Review>Kyle is the man! He made the car buying experience incredibly fast and easy ! He is not your typical cars sales man just trying to get a buck out of you.  He genuinely cared about getting me a safe car for me and my baby. I recommend using Kyle/carsight. Next time I need a vehicle  this is the place I will go!

Thanks Kyle!</Review>< user>

<Date>1609866818038< /Date><Text>Had the best Experience working with Keith I told him what we were looking for and he went on the hunt just the convenience of having some one do the leg work and the fact that we have 3 kids and my wife and I work 40+  we clearly don’t have time to run to multiple dealerships so it was just amazing having a personal shopper.  We were in the market for a Ford Explorer Keith noticed that they sale very fast meaning it must be a great vehicle so that was nice to know. Keith found our new family member  in a few days a 2014 Ford Explorer limited edition with  low mileage and price range we were looking for and we ...Love it!!!

<text>I had a fantastic experience with CarSight. Keith helped me with every aspect of my purchase, and was able to put me in a car I couldn’t be happier with. There was no pressure, no pushy-ness, kept in touch with me during the search, and checked up with me several times after the purchase, worked with my credit, got me good financing, everything was very smooth. Thank you so much, I will be buying my future vehicles and referring friends to CarSight!</text>< Date>

Car Sight is great place to buy a vehicle. Kyle is the most honest sales person you will ever meet.
I have been involved with over 40 transactions with Kyle to purchase vehicles for myself, friends, and the company I manage.
We always get what were asking for and a price that is fair to all.
If you want a sales person who will actually return phone calls and respond to texts and emails, call Kyle and don't get ripped off by the the big dealerships with false promises.
I highly recommend Car Sight and Kyle for any of your car needs.</Review>

<review>This past year had been a huge challenge for our family. We were put in a situation where we needed some cash my wife and decided to sell our 2008 Silverado. A man named Kyle did an exceptional job buying our car from use for more than what Carmax offered and he didn’t even push a sale of another car. This guy is the man of you are looking for honesty a just an out right sincere man Kyle Is the guy to talk to.

OMG! CarSight is all the way around, totally AWESOME! Customer Service here is great. This will be the second vehicle my daughter has purchased from CarSight. Keith walked my daughter through every step of the buying process for her first car, a 2000 Toyota Celica. Keith was patient with understanding this was my daughter's first vehicle purchase. He was honest about everything (although there wasn't much to tell about the Celica.) It was in great condition inside and out. When it was time to look for a second (current) vehicle we came back to CarSight. This time she got a 2003 Pontiac Vibe. Again, Customer Service was unmatched. The Vibe is also in great condition considering it's age. It looks and runs great! CarSight sales great cars at a very reasonable price! We plan on referring everyone we know to CarSight. If or when we need to consider another purchase, we will only buy from CarSight! THANK YOU CarSight! 😁< /text>

<Text>I found CarSight through a post that Michael made on Facebook. He was very responsive, answered my questions, and got me a carfax so I could review the maintenance on the Subaru Outback I was interested in. I set up a time to come to the lot and when I got there the car was pulled out and ready for a test drive.

Michael handed me the keys and told me to take it for a drive and take my time looking the vehicle over. Since he knew I had done my research and knew quite a bit about this make/model he didn't hover as I evaluated the vehicle.

I took my time and then came in to discuss pricing. They have a really nice and unique system that makes it easy to see and understand the pricing on the vehicle, the dmv fees, taxes etc. We looked it over and then discussed the pricing. It was no pressure and I paid a price I was satisfied with.

Could I have gotten a better deal? I'm not entirely sure. What I do know is that it was the most painless buying experience I've ever had and my interactions with Michael didn't give me anxiety like a typical dealership would. Their unique purchase process was actually programmed and developed by the owner of the company. It was really seemless and impressive. I actually work as a software consultant for Enterprise companies and I was impressed by what they've put together.

While CarSight doesn't appear to have much inventory they do seem to be choosy with the cars they sell. Every car on the lot was in great condition and a quick look at their inventory gave me the impression they had picked their offerings carefully. It was clear they stand behind their products and if you aren't happy with a purchase they'll do what they can to make it right -- within reason of course.

Bottom line -- I'm really happy. Thanks guys!</Text>< resp>

But Kyle found me a gem. 03 4runner that is amazing! Can’t thank these guys enough. If you have bad credit with some money down or good credit you for sure can get approved and Kyle will work hard to let you know he’s constantly trying to find the best deal for his customers. This is how used dealers should ALWAYS treat their customers. 5 stars without a doubt.

Kyle was awesome! Always responded and made time for me to view car according to my schedule.  Was honest and negotiated with me for a very fair price.  Stuck to his word, and followed thru with promises made. Would definitely buy a car from him again.</text>

As my first experience buying a car, it was amazing. Kyle who helped me through the process made it hassle free! I got a great deal for my bmw and would definitely recommend others to buy from him. He made sure that everything was fine with the car once it was ready. It made me really glad that he was not one of those dealers throwing words at you to make you buy a car.</Review>

I worked with Kyle and he was very professional from start to finish. He helped me find the car I was looking for and I’ve never been happier with the results! I’m surprised at how easy the process was and would highly recommend Kyle to everyone. Thanks for everything!<//text>

<text>Bought a car from Kyle at Carsight today and it was a great experience! Kyle was super professional, didn’t pressure me into a decision and allowed me to take time on the purchase. The car was in great condition, everything was disclosed nothing hidden like every other used car dealership! Kyle worked with my budget and got a deal done, would definitely refer friends and family to carsight inc!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Kyle from Carsight is the best! Such a painless car buying experience! I’ve always bought cars off CL from private owners and had no credit history. Kyle was willing to work with my situation and worked hard to get me a great approval rate. I’m so happy with my Toyota RAV4. Everything was just as described, and Kyle shot me straight on its cosmetic blemishes which were very minor. I can’t recommend Kyle enough, I’ll be sending anyone looking for reliable vehicles straight to him.<//text>< Pictures>

I spoke and met up with Kyle on a Friday.  I really appreciated  the honesty and no pressure to buy encounter. I bought the car (1st one I looked at too) with no hassles, no long waiting time, no trip to DMV, no hidden fees and he even delivered it to me. Did I mention he gave me a really good deal on a super clean Toyota Rav4?

If you need a car, carsight is the place to go. I bought my car with carsight and Kyle Brown help me to make the purchased. I sent him an message on facebook messenger a day prior and we set up and appointment for the next day (saturday) at 8am. I really liked his flexibility when it comes with appointments. I showed up and he was there to help me with over 20 years of experience from working with big dealerships to now his own business. We made the transaction pay the car sight all the documents and I went home to pick up my wife to go and get the car home. When we got back to pick up the car my wife and I had changed our minds of the car I had already bought, we asked Kyle if we could switch the car for another and without hesitation he said "yes we just need to redo the paperwork and switch to the other car".

We really recommend Kyle with carsight inc. for his professionalism, knowledge, great service and his great customer skills.

Thank you,

Jorge< /review>

Kyle is awesome.  Never bought a vehicle so easily, loved my experience.  All dealerships should be modeled after Car Sight. They treat you with respect and handle everything for you from DMV to delivering car to your home.  We had a broken light after truck was delivered.  No problem, got replacement in 3 days!!  Can't say enough good things .  Would definitely buy another vehicle from Car Sight.< /text>

An amazing car buying experience-- Kyle got me the exact car I wanted for at least $4k cheaper than anything comparable on the market (A BMW X3 with all the bells and whistles).. The most painfree auto transaction I've had to do. Also, he helped me in finding financing to find the best rates. I would highly recommend Kyle and Carsight.<//Review>

Very professional, was able to work with us to get financing when others wouldnt, not only did they secure the financing but actually negotiated a better interest rate, they delivered a solid car we thought we could never afford and did it all seamlessly and made it very easy  to purchase. This is the place to get your next car. thank you for the time and effort you put into this. when its time for another car, youll be hearing from us.< /text>

4 stars for thier molqajete, but customer service is horrible. 2 star on customer service . at least not rude but very inattentive. It's like you pay, they bring your food and forget you where ever thier. If you love good  food and want to be left alone come here. If you like being served and be assisted well not here. I like it but I rather go where thiers someone always checking in what else they may may serve you in.<//text>

Loved the original servers that used to be there. They worked their butts off and never messed up our orders. Lately, the service is not great! My order of simple enchilladas was boxed and received with single enchillada. Not what I asked for.  At times the food is too salty. Its hit and miss now. We used to eat there about once a week- now we eat from this place about 1 time in a 6 month period, even before the pandemic!<//review>

Very good taquitos, perfect portions. I recommend getting the chicken filled, they come with salsa, pico, gauc, and sourcream. Pretty sure the guac is house made.< /Review>

Great food, I have very high standards for tacos and they were delicious, full tacos with lots of everything I especially loved how much cilantro they added. Definitely will be going again well worth the money for the great food and its fair pricing.</text>

I came here due to a bad experience at Flaming Grill who has more stars on Google! I got bad vibes there from the start honestly.

That being said I came to El Portal and got great service. I asked for hot salsa on burrito and they were happy to accommodate. They got me a seat right away and had smiles the whole time! What a difference! Also, the food is bomb! The salsa for chips is a bit spicy (which I love) and the burrito was great!!< /review>

We like to come here when we want some mexican food. I've been coming here for a while, and have always forgotten to leave a review. I think they're the best mexican food in Auburn.

They are very consistent with their quality, and I think they've got the beat taco salad. The super tacos are my favourite, just the right amount of everything without getting over full.

You pick your own seat, they bring out chips, and a menu. Super simple in and out too.< /text>

Very authentic food. The food is wonderful. Very friendly staff. The atmosphere is cafe style. We LOVE the chili rellenos. It is a great place for a quick bite. In the past you ordered at the counter, but now they come to your table and take your order.<//review>

Good food as always, just beware of their beer prices. I decided to go for a Dos Equis in the bottle and didn't think to check the price. I figured it would be several bucks but when I got the bill they charged me $9.98!! For one bottle!? That just ain't right.</text>

Food is OK but they consistently lose my phone in orders.  Just happened again today and as usual no apologies from staff.  So I went over to Maria's over the freeway and their food is actually way better.  I'll be going there from now on.  Guess it was good they lost my order again at El Portal.</Text>

< review>
I have been here quite a few times &  every time has been delicious! I just love tacos so I normally get the hardshell tacos, chicken most of the time! They are delicious! But many of the people I go with love the huge burrito on the menu! I can’t think of the name of it but it’s not the regular burrito. Is just huge and definitely enough for two meals! I have tasted some of it before and it was delicious! It’s just always been a very pleasant experience at this little sit down restaurant!</review>

Good, reasonably priced and the wait is not unreasonable even when they are slammed. You can tell everyone works hard and works well as a Team.</Review>

My new favorite place. $2.50 vegetarian taco w/ beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream (hope I'm not forgetting anything, it seems like so much stuff!) on two soft corn tortillas. Delicious. Other thing I've tried here is a fried fish taco--also delicious. The chips and salsa are yummy, too!<//Review>

< review>
We ordered their crunchy taco plate and received street tacos. When i called to get new tacos made the lady was really rude and insisted that is what i ordered -street tacos. When i asked for a refund she demanded me to bring the tacos back! When i asked for a manager she told me he wasn’t there and she had to verify she could give me a refund. Need less to say i returned the tacos and got my money back. Will never go here again. Her customer service was the worst ever and she should not be the face of a restaurant especially if she wants to have a negative attitude. If i could give 0 stars i would.</review>

<Text>My Al pastor was great, sauce for it excellent, flour tortillas very good. Rice and beans served with were average Tex mex--rice not very good. Wife's fish taco was OK but fish not crispy.  Salsa served on table was not canned but not great. Guac was kinda weird. Did not seem very fresh. Service good and very friendly. There was a very noticeable and annoying blown speaker in the sound system. No salsa bar. We did not love.</Text><Time>1528638280399</Time>< pics>

<Text>El portal does a brisk business so turn over is good and food is always fresh. It's just a hole in the wall but in my humble opinion, it's one of Auburn's best Mex places to eat.</Text>< pics>

<rate>4<//rate><review>This places has changed quite a bit... My father used to supply them with quality vegetables that were needed. I used to eat here a few times a week. I just say they are pretty dang good still but my favorite burrito is not quite the same anymore. It's a tasty recipe I'd say but the ingredients weren't balance as well as they could of been. In the "California" 🌯 burrito the balance was far off for the amount fries in there. I realize that people would like to be stuffed by one burrito but I didn't desire that! Better luck next time I hope!<//review>< gmap_id>

Best place for Mexican food in Auburn!! Fast service and cheap prices. Food is both good and authentic! Great lunch menu for about $6! Best crispy Taco's I have ever had! Many meat choice with Taco's and enchiladas. Good tamales. Free chips and salsa. Mexican beer. Homemade flan! Always busy at lunch time!! Chili relano is to die for. Fantastic taco salad!! Munodo on most Sundays!</text>

<text>Being new to the area and after reading the shining reviews, my husband and I decided to try this place.
We have no idea how the food is because it took 15 minutes (really) to get a drink and after waiting another 20 minutes for someone to come back and take our order, we got up and left.
The salsa is NOT authentic..it's like the stuff that comes out of a jar.  How I long for authentic, tasty mexican food.
We won't be going back.</text>< pics>

Ate here three times.  Food is good but not great.  The prices shocked me they were so high.  A friend and I had two tacos and one taco one enchilada with small soft drinks about $23 plus tip.  Cafe Delicious over at 49th & Bell Rd much better at half the price.  For the price Taco Bell has pretty good food and super fast service.  Try the Deluxe Tostada at Cafe Delicious for about $7.50.  Promise you will not be disappointed and their salsas are good too.<//Text>

Special regards go out to the tostada de ceviche. I get it every time and it's always amazing. The veggie tacos are brilliant in their simplicity and complexity.

If you're ever in the area of Auburn, I would drive 2 hours to dine here. The service is exceptional. Be sure and get one of the grande size Negra Modelo! The value of everything here is worth the trip.</Text>< GmapID>

The food is good but the service is horrible,  the lady was so rude to me and made a big deal over me calling the wrong one when It was the number the had on their menu. It took over ten minutes to for her to call and cancel it over at the other place, complete attitude the whole time and made me wait over 20 minutes for my food. Never going back<//Text>

<text>Really excellent authentic taqueria with some of the best el pastor around!  Their salsa is fresh and delicious, truly a highlight of going there, the kids love their beans & rice, and their tortillas are fresh and don't fall apart!  I do have to say their chili colorado is nowhere near chili colorado however, but that's not a problem for us since we are loyal to the el pastor!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>My favorite taqueria I've ever been to. This place is very consistent and the salsa is great!
Their lengua, cabeza and menudo is some of the best I've ever had. Their chimichangas come out like a giant golden molten brick of goodness. I've never had a bad meal here and will come back time and time again. Been coming here for 8 years and ain't stopping anytime soon!< /Text><userid>107068264207045862689< /userid>< GmapID>

<review>Holy Cow, SOOOOO good!  The chicken chimi I bought was HUGE, I even snapped a photo of it with two rulers!  The size and the taste were both impressive.  I have never had a bad meal at El Portal.... It's Auburn's best kept secret and all I could ever wish is for another location, closer to me!  Like the South Auburn area, near Maidu Market would be convenient for me!!!  YUMMY!!!  PS- They usually serve menudo on Sundays.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809b053fe883c767:0x595e88bad40ee18c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Been 4 or 5 times now and it is consistently a great burrito, has never taken too long, and is a fair price. I am a very picky taqueria conneseur having lived in the Bay Area and Chico (best taco trucks in the state), so it takes a lot to impress me. Not sure what below reviewer was saying about the salsa, I've always found it to be authentic, not so much "out of a jar".<//Text>

I got two tacos with great flavor, the right amount of heat, with beef that was a tad dry, but still tastey. Overall, the restaurant was clean, even into the kitchen, which is in clear view.<//Text>

That was the worst burrito ever. Couldn't eat it. Cold, watery, giant mess. Threw it away after four bites. If I could give negative stars, I would.< /Text>
