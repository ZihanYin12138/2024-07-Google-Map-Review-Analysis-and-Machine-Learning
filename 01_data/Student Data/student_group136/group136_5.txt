<Text>Have lived here for 15 years. Very quiet, and clean. Maintenance team do a wonderful job. Call them in the middle of the night and they where there within 10 minutes. Office staff friendly and happy to help. Love the gym. No need to join one when I have one right where I live. Has almost all that a health club has. Pool always clean. Pet friendly. Love it last year they made a doggie park. Have checked out other apartments on a 2 bedroom apartment to rent prices either the same or higher.< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< response>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I am absolutely appalled with my experience at Salishan. I’ve lived here for almost two years and I’m at my breaking point of dealing with this complex. Keep in mind, I try to be as flexible and reasonable as possible, but the experience I’ve had here is undoubtedly uncalled for. When my girlfriend and I were looking at moving here, we were told the “two story” gym would be finished and accessible by our move-in date in July of 2018. The gym finished just this month (March of 2020) and it’s not two stories. We were also told during construction that our apartment would be done with the remodel by September of 2018, but it started in September of 2018 and went through the end of the year (although still seemingly unfinished). Before we moved in, we were sold on our apartment having a parking spot in front of it and Salishan gave us a letter about a week ago giving a two day notice to change parking spots in a way that would “suit everyone much better than before.” They ended up moving our spot much further away and around the corner where I can’t see it. It’s making it tough on my girlfriend with a back injury now. I feel extremely uncomfortable with our spot moving so far away considering I’ve had paint drop on my car when they were painting our parking spot covers and I have had construction lay equipment and wood way too close to my car and in my spot (I got a huge deep scratch on my car that same day as well coincidentally). There would be days that my car was so covered in sawdust, I couldn’t even see out the window. I was told a while ago that there would be a way for us to get compensation for our negative experience once construction was over, but nothing has materialized yet. I frankly don’t even know for sure if construction has finished on our apartment since there are multiple nails still sticking out on our patio and the light outside of our apartment door is still not functional. An officer came to our door one day to let me know that someone was sleeping on our stairway to our apartment, which made us feel extremely uncomfortable as well since it gets so dark without that light. When I called Salishan to get the specific issue of my parking spot sorted out, none of the employees were able to do anything except for Ruth apparently. I called Salishan six times trying to reach Ruth and spoke to someone every one of those calls checking on when Ruth would be available, only to hear by the 6th call that she was going to be in meetings all day. On that 6th call, I was also told by one of the employees that I’m “just venting at this point.” I reached out via email to resolve the parking situation and will update my review accordingly based on what happens from here. I’ve lived in multiple apartment complexes throughout the years and have never had any problems or an experience even close to as negative as this. The night that everyone got the letter about our parking spot changes, I talked to about 6 other residents and everyone I spoke to truly felt miserable living here. Save yourself the hassle and don’t give Salishan your consideration. It would be a disservice to recommend anyone to live here after the multiple lies, inconveniences, and simple lack of care.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD3DoAwXs05vc1w__Vr8CXkAR-v8SYZlqQMi9w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1587673849772, 'text': 'Graylan, we’ve contacted you several times to resolve all the issues you’ve brought up in this review. It seems like you’re not happy about your parking spot being moved which we feel may have prompted this review. When going through construction, things get delayed, changes get made, weather doesn’t permit work – these are all factors that contribute to deadlines not being met. We’re sincerely regretful that construction took as long as it did. Your building was the 6th building to get remodeled out of 18. Your building was completed February 25th 2019. Construction is now completely done, which means you won’t have to worry about any construction near your car. The paint drop was wiped off immediately, leaving no permanent mark or damage; and as for the scratch, Ruth has sent multiple emails trying to resolve the matter, which we have yet to get a response from you. We’ve also asked for documentation of your girlfriends’ injury, which might be subjected to an accommodation for a closer parking spot but again, we have not received anything from you as of today. You’ve taken to Google and Facebook to complain about things that we can’t resolve unless you work with us by providing documentation. Give us a call if you’d like to discuss this matter further.  We are happy to submit a work order to get issues addressed inside your apartment and patio areas. We don’t know of issues like this unless you bring them to our attention. Please call us today so we can hopefully resolve your frustrations 916-726-6300.'}</Response>

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Salishan Apartments.  The grounds and amenities are great and its very pet friendly.  The maintenance staff is quick to respond to requests and the office staff is professional, friendly, and great communicators.  They have navigated this pandemic with grace and understanding...especially since some of the properties amenities had to stay closed for much of 2020.

If you are looking for a place to live that is pet friendly, affordable, has courteous neighbors, and a management/maintenance staff that takes care of you and cares about the property they steward....I recommend Salishan Apartments.</review>

This review is only for Charles, the leasing manager.

My mom and I toured Salishan Apts looking for a one bedroom and Charles was the leasing manager that showed us around. He was so professional, friendly and helpful. He was so patient even in answering my mom's questions, some of which were redundant and a little negative.

He really shone though afterwards when we didn't rent with them but had created a free, online account in order to apply and wanted to delete this account. I called the office over a week later to do this. He had the best attitude with no hint of annoyance, he just wanted to help solve my problem even though it wasn't his problem and he easily could have brushed me off! Above and beyond he goes, such an excellent representative of his company! I would hire him in a heartbeat if I was in a position to.

Charles, people like you are GOLD so know how valuable you are! You have the best attitude, are genuine and live from your heart. Those characteristics cannot be taught or put on a resume! It has been my pleasure to interact with you during this transaction!</Review>

Where to start?
Our experience here has been amazing! The manager Ruth is a doll! She is always willing to listen and assist in anyway she can she made our move a breeze!
Once we moved in, we did have a little trouble with our AC, but that was immediately addressed and fixed with not only Ruth but also with Nick one of the amazing maintenance techs here at the property.
I really can’t say anything bad about this company or the property, our experience has really been a great one. I would recommend living here in a heart beat.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><text>I've lived here just under a year now and am very happy, especially as a dog owner.  The best part is the maintenance crew, in particular Nick, Jerry and Cheng (sp).   Recently I had an emergency, and the response was very fast,  professionally handled and the crew was respectful and worked around my schedule (I work from home).   Compared to other places I've lived (including the East Coast), the work orders get taken care of a lot quicker and more efficiently (even on Sundays).  When I have had to call the office Ruth has been forthcoming and gotten most everything done that I ask for. I love the trees in the neighborhood, there have been a lot of improvements lately, and overall I am very pleased with the quality of life here.  Highlighting again that Nick, Jerry and Cheng are the best!  The "little things" that happen during holidays, and now a yard sale are more than I've ever seen happen in other neighborhoods in the past.  It definitely adds a touch of togetherness and community.</text>< pictures>

<Text>STOP! THIS is where you’re next apartment should be. My Wife and I spent months looking at EVERY apartment complex in Folsom, Roseville, Carmichael, Orangevale and Citrus Heights. Salishan Apartments we’re the ONLY one that had a great mix of amenities, activities, and all for great pricing. The first thing that we enjoyed about the apartments are the grounds themselves. There’s an extremely nice river walk with a fountain and a little dog park for our dogs. This was top priority for us as we wanted a nice place our dogs could get out and enjoy every day. The next thing we were happy to see was the package room. Any packages you get from Amazon or anywhere else will be stored safely in a locker that only you call have access to via an app. It’s so cool! I no longer have to worry about packages being left on my doorstep for hours or days at a time for anyone to steal. Salishan also has quite an amazing Gym with all kinds of really nice and clean equipment for working out with. There are 2 pools, a spa, and a fire pit area which are really nice too. The units themselves are quite spacious. And they come with a washer and dryer IN UNIT! Yes! They also come with fire places which is really cool too. They even tell you during the tour through the unit that they have no problem with you wall mounting your tv or putting up shelving, etc and that they won’t charge you a fee against your deposit when you move out for it…who does that?! That’s awesome! The patio that you get is really spacious and enough for a table and chairs if you like to sit outside and enjoy yourself or have a meal.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the apartments though is the fact that the apartments don’t just take your rent each month and let things around the complex fall apart. They are constantly reinvesting money into the upkeep and upgrading of the complex. They’ve quickly taken care of trees that needed to be removed due to storms or damage. But they didn’t just remove them, they quickly replanted a bunch of new trees throughout the apartments. They’ve also upgraded the mailboxes with some nice new mailboxes. Right now, they are adding in some sidewalks and redoing curbing around the complex. It’s just super nice to see the place constantly improving. They care about the way the apartments look and it shows.

Finally, I have to mention the awesome staff. Ruth and her team are awesome. Maintenance is constantly going around and checking on things and are quick to respond to requests. They’re all super nice and a pleasure to speak with. And everyone in the office is super nice and a pleasure to work with as well. They work hard to keep everything running smooth and it shows.

Salishan Apartments is the first apartment complex where it truly feels like a community and a place that is really enjoyable to call home. You’ll really enjoy living here as much as my wife and I do, I promise! Thank you to everyone who works at Salishan Apartments for helping us call this place home!< /Text>< user_id>

My husband and I moved here in October 2019. This year, because of COVID-19, our family was hit hard financially when my husband and I were both laid off from our jobs. Salishan worked with us on a new payment date to make up the rent we couldn’t pay in March because of the job loss and let us pay a day late in October after my husband had gotten a new job, but his pay date ended up on the 4th of the month.

During this holiday season they have tried to keep up our communities spirits by holding Holiday contests, having Santa come through the community on a carriage and dropping off a gift of fudge which included a “Golden Ticket” for our specific apartment & gave us a gift card. It was very nice and unexpected.

Our work with the staff has been professional and fast. We’re grateful to still be living here.< /Text>

Ruth is the most unprofessional and disrespectful manager I’ve seen in my life. She can’t count till 4, she sabotages, she never calls back. She always asks about “documents” even if you already provided everything they asked before. And the “most perfect” thing in that performance is she will never let you know if she decline your application, she will not even send you an email or a message. You just accidentally go to their website and see the unit you applied for is on the market. Spent my time and money for nothing. Would never recommend this complex.<//text>

I absolutely loved living here. The complex is very well maintained and beautiful! The maintenance staff is always around, extremely friendly, and was always very prompt when called. The women in the office are incredible. My roommates ran out on the bill, literally leaving me with an empty apartment and rent coming up in a week. The women in the office were so extremely helpful. They were very understanding and went through all of my options with me to make it as painless as possible. I would absolutely recommend this complex to anyone looking. The apartments are very nice, spacious, and the bathroom was HUGE! I truly wish I could have stayed at this wonderful apartment complex and would recommend it to anyone who is looking.<//Text>

<text>I lived here for one year and I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews I read. The staff is great and has accomadated every request I made...timely and resolved completely. Ruth is extremely pleasant, approachable, and professional. I've seen her interaction with others and she's always been friendly and considerate. The grounds are clean, manicured, and very nice to walk the dog or just an evening stroll. The complex is undergoing construction so additional noise and traffic is expected...but the renovations and upgrades are much nicer and worth the temporary issues. Rent is a little high but given the ammenaties, responsive staff, security, and location proximity to stores, highway, and restaurants I think it's a great place to live.</text><response>{'time': 1569616845541, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your comments.

This complex is a joke. We were harassed by others and the complex did nothing to help us because they stated they had no proof. We moved into this unit for 6 months and were fooled by the nicest management. But never again. I would never recommend anyone move into this complex. They will take you for all the money you have and then some when you move out. They stated in our moveout notice that they had to replace the carpet due to extensive wear and tear and stains. Mind you we did not even wear our shoes in the house and I deep cleaned the apartment before we left but they are still charging us. There were numerous broken tiles and maintenance needs but none were solved while we lived there. To top it off the construction is non stop and causes flat tires because the construction crew does not clean up after themselves. There is also no place to park after 5 pm so don’t even think about leaving. The spots are small and many people park over the line making it impossible to park in your reserved spot. There are also cars that sat in the parking lot the whole time we lived there obviously broken down or abandoned and they never got towed or removed which took spots from us. The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors conversations like they are in the room with you. This company just wants to charge you for the money they are putting into the outside construction job. You basically can’t even live in these units without being charged. Look elsewhere. This place is garbage since the new company took over. Don’t let the cosmetic changes fool you! Almost everything in my unit had damage or problems.</Text>

<Review>The customer service here is the BOMB. They offer a military discount and keep in touch with customers while they're still trying to move there. Even while being in a different state, Andrea was an amazing rep that I've spoken to and she's helped me feel so comfortable about moving there and meeting all my needs. I haven't moved there yet but I am so excited to and feel very confident with the new place I'm about to call home. Honestly, request to speak with Andrea, she's very sweet and informative and also keeps in touch and she calls back!!! She doesn't leave you hanging or make you feel forgotten if she's ever had to call me back she does within an hour and its so nice to deal with a management who cares about their customers!<//Review>< time>

Was in a tricky situation when another apartment situation decided it was prudent to lie about the move in cost among other things all the while playing semantic games about availability. Anyway the end of the month was fast approaching. I had a week to get find a place, see it, get approved, all that bollocks.
In came Nikki to save the day and situation. She took an interest in getting me in despite of all the red tape and communication hassles associated with renting in California. She took the time to show me all the available floor plans in person and to actually take me to the units rather than showing an idealized and inaccurate "model" apartment or even worse, pictures. The best part was the fact she answered all my questions and had the place ready.
The overall vibe of Salishan is as good as it gets for someone new to the community. Always a crew of people making sure the grounds look good, no litter about and actual parking spaces near my unit. My last place I had to practically hail a cab to my car it was so far away- not fun after a days work. It was a real team effort to get me in despite typical paperwork issues (on my part) as I am used to a simpler process back East where I am from.
There were a couple minor issues (sticky bedroom lock and slightly clogged bathroom sink). I let Nikki know and the next day Nick and his associate from maintenance fixed the issues and were great conversation. Also, the buildings numbers are not particularly well displayed, but a map is given to new tenants.
I've rented many places coast to coast and Salishan stands out. Everything works and is in optimal condition in the unit. I look forward to the events and warmer weather where I can use the many amenities like Basketball Courts and Tennis. Meanwhile I can use the indoor fitness center and Racquetball court.
My first few nights I slept very well, which is a good sign for those who travel a lot. It's very quiet and tucked away from the main roads with no trains honking at all hours like the first place I almost moved to.< /review>

The staff remains to be amazing and the maintenance is great too. This is nothing against them at all. The issue is that 3 months in, we get a notice telling us that we won't be able to use our patio for a minimum of 2 months. This is a huge problem for us because apart from having a washer and dryer in the units, the porch was a major factor in picking our apartment. The porch allows my dog to be happier because she loves to be outside, and she can use the bathroom on a patch of grass when she needs to. I already struggle with having a million things to do in the morning for my health(I have Cystic Fibrosis), and that made things easier for me too so I don't have to worry about giving her morning walks on days that I work early. This is also confusing my dog because she already won't use the grass inside as she keeps trying to out on the porch to use the bathroom. She is known to have accidents inside when she can't go outside. I don't want our carpets to get stained either. They are also telling us that it will be very loud from 8-5 every day for the next few months due to the "renovations." So much for a quiet and peaceful environment to live in. Once again, due to my health, there are days I need extra sleep, so if this impairs on that, that is a huge issue. Lastly, while it isn't as big of a deal, the paint scheme they chose to change things to is absolutely hideous. Think of colors used in a Dr. Seuss book. So the cottage feel I loved about this place will be gone. As far as the patio goes, they need to reduce the rent until they can be used again, because we aren't getting what we are paying for. I'm pretty livid at this point.

Update: When we moved in the apartments had boarded patios. Now they changed it to railing, yet the first floor is still boarded. Since then, the owner has refused to allow us who live on the second floor to put up privacy screens. How is that fair? You can completely see through the windows, not to mention I don't like being seen when I want to enjoy being on the patio. I want a reasonable amount of privacy. Salishan claims to offer a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere, so why not stay true to your mission statement? Additionally, my dog tends to stick half of her body out and she could easily fall through. This is also about the safety of my dog. When we moved in, we were told that to prevent our animals from going through gaps, we were allowed to put up chicken wire. Ruth has been great in trying to mediate for us. However, I am not sure that the owners actually care enough about their tenants to listen or take anything into consideration. We pay to live here. I also don't think they care about the fact that their tenants are now paying for a product they did not agree to when the lease was signed. We would not have decided to move in here if we had known this was going to happen. Owners, please make it right. I might actually want to stay here if you do. At this rate, we are considering leaving when our lease is up as this has been the worst living experience we have ever had. Thank you.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<rating>1</rating><review>Literally go find someone else to rent before you get stuck here. I've only been here for 1 year and a half and they have increased my rent for a 1 bedroom apartment over 20% since then. What started out at 1020/ mo (not including the water fee) has turned into 1250/ mo (not including the water fee). The only nice thing I have to say is I love the repairman (Nick, I think). Since we moved in I've struggled with the lack of security and inoperable gates, our vehicle has been broken into TWICE, the constant noise coming from loud music at the bar and the parties hosted in the childrens park area. You could find way better for the price and hopefully you won't get charged for a false sense of security. I think down the street there are some nice apartments across from a residential place (not a bar/cemetery/low income housing) if you do chose to rent here my suggestion is to increase your insurance coverage so when your windows get smashed in at least someone (obviously not the salishans) will help.

Update10/29/17

If you are still debating whether to rent here, I hope this helps to advise you otherwise. If you’ve read my original review and the vague response from management I’m here to give you an update on how well they are working to fix the issues. The front gate hasn’t been able to close for over a month in that time we’ve had other windows being smashed in and glass on the parking lot, homeless that are sleeping in the park at night, and holes in the metal fence. The security concerns are not taken seriously, maybe because they don’t live here at night but the rest of us do. It’s not safe to walk around with how many lights that are out and have been out for at least 6 months. You know it’s bad when the mail package doors are always hanging by a thread because of criminals ripping the open. Hopefully this helps you to decide to rent elsewhere; my hopes is to either convince you to find a safer place for your money or to actually get a fundamental plan from the management about how they are going to resolve the issues. Why would the residents care who you are teaming up with to solve the problems? It’s not working and your dodging the issue, you’d make a great politician but not manager.<//review>< pics>

I'm not sure this place is getting bad reviews. I've read some of them, and I can definitely tell you this. The management and maintenance have been nothing but respectful, prompt and helpful. I call or walk over to the office with a problem, knowing it will be handled ASAP. All the staff are great! I am a current resident here, and the only people I've ever seen complain are people who were rude and impatient. So as far as the reviewers go, I obviously don't know how their experience was here but I'm willing to bet, it was troubled people who were bad residents and we're treated as such. I can honestly say, I love this apartment complex and I hopefully will be staying another year!</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>This is a HORRIBLE apartment complex to live in.  First of all they raise the rent over $500 when your lease is up to get you to leave.  They also take away your entire deposit and have no reason why.  The property is poorly taken care of.  They don't have gates that close so there are constantly bums coming in and searching through the trash cans.  They took over three months to get back my deposit check which is illegal.  The manager refuses to return my calls and blames it all on corporate.  They act like they are an apartment community that is well taken care of but really they are in a ghetto area and over charge when really they have poor service, crime, and don't care about their residence.

PS- Read the reviews below and see how Brandy the apartment manager tries to address everyone's concerns.  They don't care about a single resident here.  Listen to me when I tell you that Salishan is a DUMP.</Text>< pics>

We very much care about all concerns and it is our goal to address and hopefully correct situations if needed. The community manager Brandy, sent your refund check within 21 days and you contacted us 60 days later for a new one because your check was torn. This is why it took longer to get another one reissued to you. Your concerns regarding the rental increase is deeply concerning since our largest increase has never been more than 8% to market. If you planned to go month to month then your rate could go up $400. The homeless around the area have increased not only in Citrus Heights but all over the Sacramento area.

Make sure you guys do a walk thru with their employee before you move in and before your lease is up when you decide to leave. If you do not request  a walk thru before vacating, they will take your whole deposit (e.g. $1,000) for replacing old carpets that needed to be replaced anyways. Worst place to live ever. Even if they decided the carpets were "clean" before moving in, at least mail the summary of charges to our new address. After 10 months of nothing in the mail, we had to contact them to inquire about our deposit.<//text>

I see a lot of bad reviews on here all the time. They are a lot about their deposit being taken from them, when in my opinion if your apartment has carpet stains and isn't clean then what did you expect. Peoples idea of clean probably isn't accurate. in my experience its quiet, clean and the office people are respectful to me because I am respectful to them. and as far as the bums going in the dumpsters, YES that is sooo frustrating seeing people go through my trash along with other peoples when we work hard for our living and for a safe place to live. but they can't control that. its rare at I'm out after 9pm but if I am I see paladin driving around which I personally appreciate. apartment complex's will never be perfect but I've had nothing but good experiences here.<//text>

<review>This is the 3rd apartment complex I've lived in and it's the best apartment complex so far. I've lived here for almost a year and have been treated with nothing but kind, professional help from all of the office staff. The only time I ever had to call maintenance (due to heavy rains, there was some minor flooding at the base of the steps to my apartment) they were prompt and they fully fixed the issue. The office also contacted me to offer a better covered space as they had a closer one become available. All areas of the complex are well-kept at all times, the leaves are cleared away in the Fall and the grass is green in the summer. I have had some issues with there being dog poop in the grass, but I don't think this reflects poorly on the apartment complex because they have free doggie bags set up at every grassy area for the owner's use - there is only so much they can do! It is a very pet-friendly apartment, which I love and the other tenants have all been kind and relatively friendly. I would definitely recommend this complex.< /review><gmapID>0x809adfbeee161ec5:0x8442202333e11dbd</gmapID>< Rating>

All the power outlets in our apartment were loose, all the plugs for our TV’s, laptops, etc had to be bent so they would stay in. Even though the community is gated, vagrants are digging through the trash in the middle of the day and the middle of the night. The gym has two treadmills and two elliptical machines, twice the treadmills stopped while I was at a fast pace damn near hyperextending my knee as the belt just stopped. They had invested in re-landscaping and used some plants that attract bees, so we have limited the walks with the dog and kids.
After about a month we noticed the stains resurfacing in the carpet, the oven and drier were of deteriorated quality, taking a very long time to heat up and dry. A few months after we moved in, the dog park out front was closed and fenced off. We tried to go to the playground area inside the Salishan grounds, there was dog poop everywhere and the playground was filthy. We returned a couple weeks later to see if it was a fluke but no, just as gross and our basketball rolled over some dog poop and that was the end of that.
They double charged me rent in March, then put a ‘second “Pay Rent or Quit” notice’ on my door a few days later (never received the first). After much back and forth I received acknowledgment of their wrongdoing. I felt I was pretty cool about them taking $2400 out of my account (rent is $1200/month), but the front office handled this so poorly it was ridiculous. The following month I reconnected with the manager to verify the autopay was setup and good to go, she never got back to me and I just wrote a check and had my wife take it in. The last time I went to the office with a problem she blew up on me. Perhaps I approached her wrong with my pregnant wife had to jump over the balcony to get into the house because the locks on the front door are shotty.
I’ve determined the owner/managements strategy is to market the place to look like a luxury resort, investing in repaving the parking the lot, landscaping, keeping the front pool clean and pretty (back pool area is a different story). Once your locked in, they don’t care about you, which explains the high turnover and moving vans every weekend in the parking lot.
The year living here is an experience that needs to be forgotten. The primary reason we moved here was because they took large dogs, Foxborough apartments down the street has the same dog policies, try that place.
When we moved they reported back to potential landlords that I had bounced checks twice, something that was mentioned in the aforementioned ‘second notice’ after they had charged me twice that month (and autopay had worked fine the previous 6 months).</Review>

Not only do the CONSTANTLY do unnecessary upgrades to the apartment complex that come to an inconvenience to many people but when the do those "upgrades", nothing changes. The first month I moved in they tour down alot of wood finishings on the balconies which exposed the wood to the elements (this is when it was raining everyday). Then instead of replacing the now wood rotted support beams, they instead just covered it with painted finishings. They barely matain the second pool which is the only pool that kids rarely go to. Which is totally fine that kids play in the pools but it's frustrating when all the pools are not matienced. On top of everything, which pushed me to write this review. The complex decided that they wanted to do major parking lot construction and instead of giving me a months or weeks notice. I receive a note on my door two days before they place tow zone signs in the area where I have to park. Not only was the asphalt construction not needed, but they didn't suggest or offer alternative parking in a safe area considering I pay for security and gating. Gating which barely ever works in any given week span.

UPDATE:

Woke up to another morning of homeless people sleeping in the children’s park. Any parents moving here, I really hope you aren’t allowing your children to the park unsupervised as this apartment complex has zero concern for their safety. There’s homeless people digging through trash cans, doing drugs in the park, and homeless people riding there bikes through the complex now look in cars. Want to know how this complex addressed the issue. They removed the bushes from the fence. Great Job Salishan! How about cameras, more lights, and better security because all I see is a security guard that sits on his phone in front of the rental office.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1469030561257, 'text': 'We sincerely apologize for every inconvenience associated with our property improvements.

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>DO NOT LIVE HERE.
When I moved into this apartment complex, I was so excited to live here. However, my excitement was brought to an immediate halt when I discovered the lack of concern the management has for it's residents.
In OCTOBER, someone came into my apartment and boarded off my balcony with a huge, hideous piece of wood. But no big deal, I had thought, they will fix whatever was wrong with my balcony. WRONG. It's MAY now and I still have no access to my balcony, but I listen to the construction workers demolishing walls and other stuff outside my apartment all day long. Its obnoxious and every time I call to ask about my balcony I get a lame excuse. They tried to bribe me with River Cat tickets too lol. I don't want stupid baseball tickets I can get for free, I want my balcony.
Besides the fact that I havent had a balcony for about 8 months now (pretty much my whole lease) they REFUSE to give us a discount on rent. The management is greedy and doesnt care about you. My neighbors have MOLD all through their walls and are having their walls removed/replaced. The construction workers are noisy and obnoxious too.
They claim its a "gated community" but the gates barely work half of the time. The dumpster was "expertly" placed outside of my apartment so I hear the trash being taken at 6am in the morning. Someone's car alarm also goes off constantly through the night and no one does anything about it.
And to top it off, they want to raise our rent to over $1500 for a 1 bedroom without a balcony...
Do yourself a favor and find ANY other complex. I'm thankful my lease is ending soon because I couldnt inagine staying in this place any longer.< /Text>< resp>

I had to leave Salishan two years earlier than I wanted because every time my neighbors' tire went down 25 to 30% because she had a slow leak, but not bad enough to go buy a new tire yet, they kept slapping a "tow away sticker on her car". They are real big on that sort of thing. I figured it was just a matter of time till they started that crap on me. It was the same tire each time and the car was otherwise kept very clean. My neighbor had put up with a lot from the other tenants at Salishan and she never complained or did anything to bother anyone. She had neighbors who begged for food and money from her and another neighbor who complained so much about being able to hear her bathroom fan and her doors opening and closing which was not her fault. Salishan should fix these kinds of things not the tenants. After watching what she went through I thought it best to just leave.<//Review>

<Text>It’s an okay pizza place. It has the freshness but not the taste and the pizza is very dry. Not that much sauce on the pizza. Don’t get me wrong though, they do it make it on the spot and is fresh but the taste is just not their and that’s what they are lacking on. The wings are pretty good also. The only reason they are getting a 3 star is because the lack of taste of their pizza.< /Text></record>

We had a basic large pepperoni and cheese pizza, we ordered double pepperoni and they put on about 4 times more than we usually get else where . Great service and the pizza tasted awesome, and only $15. The only thing that would make it better would have a deck oven to cook it in, I'm not a fan of conveyor ovens.</Review>

Stopped for the night at the RV Park across the street from the Pizza Factory. Went there for dinner , Nicole was so friendly and helpful. The pizza, salad and wings were excellent.  Nicole made our first time there a wonderful experience< /Review>

I have tried to get delivery service on three different occasions. Each time the staff acted as though it did not matter if I ordered or not. I only got a pizza delivered once out of the three attempts. One other time I was told to , "Just come and pick it up." I canceled the order the last time. The pizza is decent. It isn't great by any standard. The locals get treated different maybe. If you are traveling through, dont waste your time.</text>< user>

Keep your pajamas on, we deliver! Not before 4PM! Even then there is a price limit. I would have had to order more than I could eat. Called around lunchtime and was told no delivery until 4PM, called back then and was told I had to order more. Just one guy, can’t eat more!< /Text>

The Pizza here is fantastic!! Large quantities of really fresh quality ingredients, and fairly priced. So very tasty!! Employees were all so very nice and it's obvious that they put effort into what they do. I appreciate that...thanks!!<//Text>

The pizza was good. There's something desolate about this whole plaza though. They don't have trash cans outside and when we went inside to throw away our Starbucks that we drank with our pizza they told us we can't throw away outside trash. Bathrooms are customer only and the clerks were paranoid about making sure it was locked. The pettiness of policies like that make me sad for the people who live and work here.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Customer service was horrible. I placed a mobile order because my lunch is only 35 mins. When I arrived they told me it was gonna be 10 more mins. The estimated time was incorrect. I waited 10 more mins in my car and when I walked in the guy looked like he had just started making my pizza. I asked him if that was mine and he said no that the girl was making it in the back. That was weird. When the girl came out I asked her and she said it was gonna be 15 mins. I asked her for a refund and she refused. She said she did not know how to do a refund. I waited for her to try to figure it out and she kept calling different people on the phone. I asked her for her name and she refused. They had a few other customers waiting for their pizza for over 30 mins. Prior to this time, I ordered a pizza that was raw. The cook said it was because it was the first pizzas he had made. He was nice enough to prepare new ones but I had to drive back to pick them up. Overall, I avoid this pizza factory<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Simple but amazing. I will drive from Gustine to santanella just to get this pizza. It’s so much better thank the pizza factory in Gustine. And they actually put extra sauce on when I ask for it. Bomb pizza. Not too pricey, especially if you look for coupons online (they have a lot of options)<//review>

<Text>It's a nice walk on calm days. Watch for waves and pot holes. There are warnings telling you not to walk out on the jetty but you can make your own decision based on the conditions. Grab a coffee and friend and head out.<//Text>< rate>

Fun little town and a very neat feature. It's an easy walk all the way out. This isn't a bad way to stretch your legs during a long car ride. There was a decent brewery not too far away too.< /text>

Sureal location to visit. I love the intensity of the jety and the dramatic scene it represents on the northern coast of California.  Definitely a must see visit if your staying in Crecent city 😀 👍.</Text>

<review>The stroll was worth the water scenery comparative between the bay and the open ocean. Be ready for a 20 minute walk. I enjoyed the unique concrete water breaks and the fog horn sound as I strolled. You also get a good view of the lighthouse during the journey to the end of the jetty.<//review><response>None< /response><rate>4< /rate>< gmapID>

The Jetty is awesome and has a lot of historic information all around it. You might have to go anywhere to Crescent City to figure out why the cement structures are there and shape that way but it's worth the journey. I did not make it to the lighthouse because I do not allow dogs which I wish they told me that when I was out in the parking lot but I may have missed the sign. Didn't want to leave my dogs in the car on a hot day. But it was a awesome Journey walking around the area I come back every single time :-)</text>

Cool stop for us. We walked along the beach to stop at the lighthouse. Stayed up there for 30 min or so and snapped some pictures of the beach.

If you hit it at the right time, you may be able to see some whales!< /Text>

<text>I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves the sound of the ocean. The waves crashing against the jetty along with the sound of the seabirds is so relaxing. The fog rolls in so fast that the city disappears right before your eyes. It must be very popular with the locals. I could get use to taking early morning or evening walks with the puppies out here.< /text>< UserId.>

The walk down the Jerry to the ⚓ Anchor Graveyard was awesome. Got to see lots of wildlife :crabs, pelcians (most I have seen ) a black bird with a long orange beak (I do not know the name) Kill deer(Yes this is what the birds are called) Cranes and Blue Heron. Also, saw Harbor Seals ,squirrels and seagulls.
There's also a park area with picnic tables , beach access, and toilets. Beach area is Sandy and rocky is safe and clean for childern. Toilets are kept clean also.
Would recommend stopping here if your in the area.< /Review>

It's a run down town and the sewage place is near by the lighthouse, sending a smell that you don't want to remember every 5 seconds. The bathrooms by the beach is not clean at all. I only gave it a 2 star because of the lighthouse and because I witness a humpback whale that day. Oh,  there is a little carnival near by. I didn't check it out, but if you have kids or to have a good time, that could be place to stop by.</Text>< Pics>

High quality and fresh, light ingredients. The Mexican pizza was on a paper thin crust and loaded with what seemed to be an entire meal including salad on top..all for $11.00. It was excellent in taste, texture and quantity. The fajita consisted of grilled chicken breast on a ton of grilled onions and green peppers.  It came with two freshly made flour tortillas and some paltry toppings.  It was very filling and tasty but I thought overpriced.  There were no chips or beans included or guacamole. Not even any sauce.  I thought that there should be more to a fajita but nothing was greasy and the pairing of this dish with the pizza made a great meal.</review><user_id>117400010725583077164<//user_id><GmapID>0x80c2beb0bd46564d:0x80bfb3c67d827e6a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The corn pancakes are amazing ! Also had oyster shooters (pictured) with beer, breakfast tamale, grit in my belly, and the Mexican crepe. The corn pancakes were by far the best, and the grits second.< /review>

<text>This review is based on one and only time there..m I will not return after today..
I'm so sorry to disappoint you regardless the very good pictures they have. Check out how many latin reviews they have to see of they are reliable.
If you go for the picture, is a good vive for that, before the night time, since is a dark room environment... the food is BAD, the chips were soaking oil, the corn tortillas too. I asked for the chicken fajitas, the veggies were literally stuck to the hot plate to the point it got bitter. They didn't offer salt, pepper, salsa or anything else. The plate comes with a side of Pico de Gallo, shred cheddar and sour cream, on the same small plate! The pico the Gallo got watery and, well you can imagine how was it...
I strongly recommend you, if you want to eat real Mexican or good food in general, research good first not just on instagram or open table.
I'm sorry if in your review you think this place has good Mexican food,  let me tell you:::::: you are missing out!!!!</text>< Pictures>

<Text>The food was good but service was practically absent. I had to unfortunately flag down the host on several occasions just for a waiter to finally get to our table. I would have understood, except it wasn't even busy. Probably won't be back as there are plenty of good Mexican restaurants within a few miles.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I got a vegetarian super burrito and my girlfriend got a carne asada super burrito. We both liked our burritos but I think there is some magic that other nearby taquerias work that this place doesn't quite have yet.<//Text>

Sat at bar right away. Cadillac margarita's were very good. Great guacamole. Loved the fish tacos. Filet tacos were a little dry. Bar tender was very nice in suggesting dishes.</Review>

Incredible Bar Tenders! I did not eat here, only had drinks. However, these guys know the drink game, and have it perfected. We actually witnessed the pursuit of perfection as we sat at the bar, and they worked on a new drink. It was phenomenal. I'll have to write another review, another day about the food. For this excursion, call me impressed! Given the drink scene in this area, and the over priced templates most places follow, this one was worth it. It was really nice to see some people who cared about authenticity!</review>

<Text>I am torn between three and four stars, great location and great staff but pricey for what you get and living off location, but the staff is great even if they are living off the tip

Dozen Ca sampler oysters: 5 stars
Clam chowder with clams: 4 stars not your standard clam chowder came with clam in shells but a bit watery
Mussels with fries: 4 stars
Seafood stew: solid 4 stars with lots of squid and not so much fish
Squid Salad: 5 stars with generous helping of tender squid</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Food: B None of their tacos were outstanding. Kinda pricey too for basic tacos.
-Carne Asada Taco ($6)
-Chicken ($5)
-Baja Fish ($6)

Drinks: A
-Mezcal Mules - don't remember cost but drinks were tasty!

Service: A
-Blonde Female bartender was very nice especially when I was complaining about my date... Quick and held the bar down.

Will be back for a future date hah.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Almost not worth reviewing and expending the time and energy.  The food was so bad and really terrible that I'm reluctant to put it in the same category as as an average restaurant.  It felt like a taco truck was parked outside except that you couldn't actually order what you wanted. . .like a chicken enchilada instead of a steak one. . .I know, complicated.  Stale chips, bad seafood and cold tacos are just a start. The service was equally poor.  This restaurant was a big let down.<//review>

<Text>Got the taco pizza which was more like a cut up tostada (but delish). It was busy and bustling, seemed like they needed a bigger bar and more staff to handle the volume.

I can highly recommend this restaurant! We got there early so the staff was not very busy but every single person who walked by the table was helpful, empty plates were gone in a flash, excellent service. I have had 4 out of the 7 types of tacos and they were great. Mexican pizza, Green Campechana (like cerviche), Fun drinks, if you want to save $ order the great n/a cocktails like the JJ Cooler and yes, share! Save room for the churros - they are so delicate and fresh and the chocolate ganache they are served with is beyond good! I can't wait to go back for the Ainoko - Chef's Table experience!< /Review>

If I could a negative star, I would.

This was about the worst Place I have ever been to, and I eat out a lot.

1) The Host was very rude. She seemed to be very focused on me and my friend’s appearance, and kept complimenting us in a condescending tone.
As if she was trying to point out what was wrong with our looks.  And believe me, my friend had on a gym outfit on and I was very preppy. You can check my instagram to see what type of person my friend and I are, or would dress like to ear out. ( ig : @cindyxylex )

The host then directed us to what looked like the smallest table in the darkest corner of the restaurant, next to the kitchen and bathroom entrance. Which resulted in a lot of traffic right next to us.

2) A very unprofessional waiter then approaches me. He does not introduce himself, and does not inform us that he will be our waiter. Noo, He just decides it will be ok for him to get  really close to my ears  as if he was about to tell me a secret and only for me to hear him ask if we wanted some water.

He never spoke loud enough for my friend to hear him and insisted on staying right next to my ear. Forcing me to repeat everything he tells me to my friend across the table.

3) The same rude waiter then brings over the bottle of water already opened, and as he serves it to us, he spills the water on the table and on my friend’s phone, and never apologizes for it nor does he clean it up and simply hastily rushes back to the kitchen. Whose entrance is again right next to our table if you can visualize that.

4) Another waitress then comes and introduces herself and asks if we need any water or drinks to start, which gives me the impression the previous waiter was not assigned to us. My friend and I go ahead and explain our previous encounter with another waiter and so she insists only she will be taking care of us without asking wha he did.

5) The traffic of people leaving from the kitchen to tables and bathroom becomes more and more intense and we decide this was too much for us to handle and ask the host if we can be given another table and as we are explaining our experience, she starts talking to some guy who approached her without asking us to excuse her.

Another hosts then approaches us and asks if we were helped. We repeat whatever we were telling the previous host , and we get a lie from this host who says she’s sorry but unfortunately there is no availability.

This was a lie because we came and talked to her after  we saw people leaving a table. Otherwise we would have headed back home.

As we angrily leave disappointed by our experience at a place we were so hasty to try, we see a group of people coming in and they ask to have a table. Which clearly means they did not have a reservation. Well guess what? They were ushered to a table which was not the corner table we were ushered to.

We luckily ended up going to El Carmen which proved to us how rude this place was because their employees were a lot more respectful and nice.

Save yourself from a horrible night and wasted money and DO NOT GO HERE.</text>

Apparently everything on the menu is 'share size' .. Altogether between a friend and I we spent $88 on 2 very small cocktails, one bottle of beer , share size dish (see image), corn tortillas and butter & two tacos .. Come on, seriously?</text>

I called on Sunday to see if anyone could see my husband and the girl I guess she is a receptionist says “everyone is gone and we’re closed.” Mind you they close at 4pm on Sunday and it was 2:30 when I called. Like if your going to rep a business don’t you need to be getting business instead of turning them away... completely Unprofessional!!!</review>

Does not even compare to San Diego Barbers. Ask for a low fade, I get a non blended high fade. Ask for a small light trim in the top, cuts more in the middle of my hair then the back or front. Walking around and people ask me what happened to my hair. They ask if I tried cutting it myself! Price is horrendous for service. 10/10 do not recommend unless you want a high fade that does not look even.</review>

< review>
I have had a beard for years and  decided to grow it out. It had been 4  months  sense I started to let it grow out and wanted to get it  trimmed up a little bit to help the growth of the beard. The gentleman that trimmed my beard took too much off in length. I asked to have it lined as well and I Thought that he would have  used a  straight razor not his clippers. I’m vary unhappy with it. Puts me back 2-3 mouths in growth. Will not be going back or recommending anyone to go here.</review>

I came is as a "walkin" so I got to observe at least five of them in action. I could see during my time there and the service I received that they are dedicated to customer service.  A woman and her son walked in and the owner asked if she would like them to change the music.  Top notch.  Go and see for yourself.  In time I betcha they will need a bigger place.  Cuz these guys are all going somewhere big</review>

I heard of this place from some friends that started going there and telling me to get my cuts at this place. The shop itself is clean, barbers are chill, and they have a good playlist. The first time I went during the week and the wait was long but the it was totally worth it, they give a really good cut for just $20. I went again on Sunday and the wait was less. I won't be going to any other barber now that I found this place.<//Review>

Marco is simply the best at his craft. He's very popular so expect a wait up to 1 hour.

But, they are really good at what they do. Dom is 100% the best person there and takes his time making your cut dope.< /Review>< pictures>

This was my very first massage for 30mins and was very relaxing and calming. The staff was very helpful and since it was my first massage, she was very easy. Will definitely go again.<//Text>

<Text>Today 3 of us went for massages.  A friend of mine has been there before my other friend and I had never been there when you pull up to the building you go to the back side it doesn't even look like it would be anything ..you go up the stairs and enter into a very welcoming lobby. After we wrote down what kind of massages we wanted I had the combo of Thai and Swedish together they took us down a hallway after giving us some slippers and we had our massages. They had a us get completely undressed and gave us Thai pants to wear which are big enough for practically anybody. It was nothing like I had experienced before lots of different techniques and stretching it was absolutely amazing I would highly recommend this place.</Text>< Pics>

I have been to Tik Thai 3 times total. Twice on my own and one time for a couples massage with my husband. I love this place. Everyone has always been professional, friendly, and really great.  I personally love the Thai massages, being stretched and more than just a massage. They do a fantastic job.</Review>

<Text>The other reviewer wasn't joking. This was better than any massage I'd had in Thailand. For that matter this was the best massage I've ever had. The perfect amount of pressure and I feel like a million bucks. Prices are good. It's a bit hidden but next to Denny's so not that hard to find.  Definitely highly recommended. I'll be going back again for sure.< /Text>< pictures>

There's no elevator and little signage on the outside so you have to be confident in knowing you are at the right place but the massage was great and everyone was professional and helpful. As soon as the person at the front desk finished scheduling someone who called in, they helped set me up with the proper massage as a walk-in. I was given Thai shorts (very large size) to wear rather than being completely nude or in my underwear.<//review>

Definitely NOT massage envy! But that's not a bad thing! Thai massage involves stretching and lot's of targeted and precise walking on your back by people who know what they're doing! I was a little hesitant at first but after the great massage I am a convert! Will definitely be going back!</Text>

<Text>Not sure how they have such high ratings, there must be some good masseuse, but mine was definitely not one of them. She only pressed down with her elbow and feet for long periods of time, which I understand is part of it but should not be the entire massage. When supposed to use her hands and put pressure she would not, literally 10 seconds at a time with barely touching, which I was eventually glad because her nails were too long. The ‘head rub’ she would literally be scratching my head which is just weird instead of putting pressure. I was just hoping for it to be over. Not much or great stretching at all. When ‘massaging’ the feet, she rubbed the top, did not even touch or put pressure on the bottom. Gave them a 2 star because my boyfriend’s masseuse did use her hands a bit more and massaged him a bit. I know what a good Thai massage is like, and this was NOT one of them. I did come with a Groupon so I wonder if that has to do with it, guess you get what you pay for. Don’t waste your time here!< /Text>< user>

Even my very stiff husband loved it. If you have a lower back problem (structural), be sure to mention that and possibly consider declining some of the stretches that bend you way back, or some of the routines where they kneel on your lower back. I do, and had to really use my core to protect my lower back. But in the event experienced no issues. Also loved the menthol oil from Thailand. Great overall experience.</review>< pics>

<Review>So owner saw this review on yelp, and when I returned what does she do to rectify?... Gives me a hard time about it. Demand I change it!
😆

First off.

Great massage, Nina. (Thank you!)

She is very well trained, and an way going, hard working pro.  (Likely under paid by owner.)

Anytime you get the therapy needed AND doze off - never saying ouch - you know it's perfection.

Unfortunately, the woman manning the ship today, whom i believe is the owner, actually asked me how I was going to pay... OVER THE PHONE while making the app. Huh?

Then, more of the same rudeness, and the audacity to blame over use of my card on a declined transaction.

*Naturally, it was her input error.  Doooh !

Wish they still had those schools where people could learn manners, or just the basics of customer service.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Better than traditional Thai massages in Thailand! 😎 90 minutes of pure heaven. Aromatherapy, strong, yet gentle manipulations, combined to both relax and loosen the tightness associated with today's stressridden existence. Weekly visits are sincerely recommended. 🇹🇭< /review>

We’ve had a wonderful experience getting the professional Thai massages at Tik Thai Spa couple times already! Sweet, caring staff and nice calming atmosphere 😊. We are coming back EVERY WEEKEND and genuinely can’t wait it! :)< /review>

<Text>Fabulous experience! Tranquil and relaxing atmosphere when we entered the quaint and well decorated establishment.  As first time clients, our registration was exceptionally smooth and easy with the help of a very considerate front desk professional. Now,  as for the massage... I requested a medium strength, semi-deep tissue treatment . The Masseuse was fantastic! And her strong hands relieved all my tense muscles . She even preformed some therapeutic  'chiropratic like' adjustments to my back and legs that felt so good! The calming sounds of soft music and the gentle aroma that drifted throughout our room encouraged me to give this place a "5~STAR" rating !</Text><Date>1510947808432<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Finally a great traditional thai massage. Surprisingly good thai massage is hard to fine in the South Bay. Do all the back walking, stretching, wtc. Good price too. Check groupon first!< /review>< Pictures>

It wasn't too bad. It was a little odd that the women doing our couples massage talked to each other quite a bit. Overall, I feel that they did a decent job. I'm not sure how to explain it, but they stretch you out very good. After a long week at work and in the gym, I sure needed it. 5 stars for that. The back massage portion was meh...<//review>

Phenomenal. If you aren’t familiar with Thai massage, it involves most elements of traditional massage, plus a bit of stretching. It feels great. I highly suggest a 90 minute session for maximum relaxation and stress relief.< /text>

This was our first massage ever. We enjoyed the couples massage. My massage therapist was very attentive and personable. However, my husband's massage therapist was a little rough, so he didn't enjoy it as much.</Review>

Best massage I've ever had! Consider it a very deep massage that gets out all your knots and they really focus on tension and stress points. I've been recommending this place to all my friends!< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>If you're apprehensive of this place because teeny ladies bashing the knots out of you scares you, your fears are justified and that is exactly what will happen.

But haven't you heard of 'No pain No gain'? If you wanna do away with those knots and stiff tights borne out of your ridiculous postures and sleeping orientations, you gotta go thru this ritual. Go get beaten up for 60 mins and experience the full 180º movement of your neck after, like putting on glasses for the first time after years of squinting at the blackboard.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Tik was trained at the esteemed Wat Pho Thai Traditional Medical and Massage School at the royal temple Wat Pho Temple where the training can last a full year. She has helped me with me with joint pain for years, and I highly recommend her or anyone on her team.</Text>

A good Park to take your kids for a great day of fun whether not is playing basketball running their 50 yard dash or even in the play areas for the smaller kids they have a swim stadium there that's outstanding with a great slide for kids and also for adults.</Text>

Peaceful place in the A.M to utilize the track to work out. I only wish they had work out equipment like other parks. That would make it a 5 star rating. Some what historical also. Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis both had their careers start at this park.</Text>

2 pools only 1 open due to staffing,  advised to go to another facility not an option my area my only option.   This location should be treated with same respect as other locations.   Sounds very political should be allotted same curticies as other locations</Review>

<text>Very clean. Only thing that the workers there stay on your ass for wearing the wrong swimming suit. Must be swimming suit. You cannot enter without you wearing a bathing suit even if your not going in the water. Life gards are very young.almos look like teenagers unless they are..<//text>< Name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The park is nice because it has basketball courts, tennis courts, skate ramps, baseball fields and a very nice and well structured section for young children. In addition to several months here, there is a lot of surveillance by the police.

(Original)
Es agradable el parque ya que cuenta con canchas de básquet, tennis, rampas para patinetas, campos de baseball y una sección para niños pequeños muy bonita y bien estructurada. Además de varios meses para aca hay mucha vigilancia por parte de la policia.<//Text><userid>113996126918604498188< /userid>< time>

(Translated by Google) I love coming to this pool, it is very clean, only that those who work here always look bitter.

The tomato sauce is amazing. Great staff and atmosphere. We always order for take out due to Covid. About 25 min for the pizza. We highly recommend it.</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>I’ve eaten at Heirloom a few times and it’s always been good, but was pretty disappointed with my customer service tonight. I ordered a small deep dish and a salad. Nothing crazy. I get home and the dressing is not in the salad box. I call and the employee says “oh I’m sorry, I’ll tell the manager” and hangs up. I wasn’t going to drive back as they were closing. I tipped them too because times are tough & I like to support my local peeps! This isn’t the first time dressing has been forgotten.

When your only source of business is takeout, you’d think more effort would be made to correct a mistake (take my name for future maybe?) Food is good, but lacking in detail.

Edit: Touched base with the owner who made it right. I appreciate that!<//Text>< Pics>

Hands down one of the better places in this area for deep dish. I used to go to the Bay Area for deep dish but now I don't have to because I got this place. The Bixby And everything else is fire. Don't play yourself. Just take a deep dive in the deep dish.</review>

Really the only deep dish pizza in town, but don't let that make you think it's just "ok." If you've been to Chicago you'll definitely appreciate these pizzas all the same. Layers loaded with toppings, crust is the cornmeal kind that's study yet delicious. The English Ales beers on tap pairs perfectly with everything. We had the roasted beets for an appetizer which I really enjoyed, the goat cheese and walnuts packing tons of flavor. Staff was friendly and pizza came out sooner than I expected. Great place!< /Review>

Visiting Monterey and wanted to get some pizza - they have the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, with a thin, crispy crust and a thick meaty top with plenty of ingredients. The only negative we had was that we ate it all before we felt satisfied!<//Text>

Location is clean, but has a loud bar vibe.

We'd like to try the thin crust pizza next time!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>The pizza was amazing. I did not get the deep dish. I like less crust. Everything on my pizza was really good and the crust was not burnt. Fresh local ingredients. The server treated a single person with lots of service. I was not put into a corner. This is a new go to place on my next visit to Monterey.<//Text>< Pics>

A nice quaint pizza parlor in Monterey, California with modern décor.  At the time of this writing, a small pizza was $20.50.  You're allowed to split the pizza into half of one topping and half of another.</Text>

While taking a day trip to Monterey, we stumbled upon Heirloom Pizza Co. There was a long wait and the restaurant was full but managed to get bar seating. The sweet & spicy wings were on the spicy side but crispy. The deep dish pizza took a longer time to cook but was well worth the wait. Highly recommend!< /Text>

<Review>Wow, delicious, and incredible service! They toss some corn meal underneath the pizza for both deep dish and thin crust. This makes the crust the right amount of crispy and textured and delicious.

The service was incredible too. Friendly and helpful but never intrusive. The human who served us was positive and encouraging while being really on top of everything. Everyone else there seemed smiley and happy too.

To top it all off, it’s only $20 for a loaded deep dish pizza that left two of us stuffed even after a day of activities. Oh, and the bathroom is brand new and surprisingly nice.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808de425c8ca6b85:0x7cbfdd98dd5c8f81< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Being an Illinois native I tend to distrust anything that touts deep dish pizza "Just like Chicago's"... Well, Heirloom pizza delivers on that.
Being a carnivore I chose standard fare of pepperoni and sausage. Those ingredients are the dead giveaway for a quality pie. The crust was as good, if not better than my favorite, Lou Malinati's back in Illinois. The right amount of sauce (people tend to skimp on the sauce) to meats ratio, crispy crust but tender and fluffy on the inside.
I had to hold back on a 5 star rating because they rushed the baking right at the end, to expedite the order is my guess, so the cheese didn't melt all the way through,  reducing the cheese pull necessary to achieve that fifth star.
I will be back though. It's truly the best pie I've had out on the west coast to date...<//Text>< pictures>

<review>So I have eaten pizza 🍕 pretty much my whole life and this pizza place is unlike any other. First, the owner is doing a fantastic job handling food and customers during covid 19. (no dine in) we ordered take out. We ordered half and half large margurita and Napoli pizza. And a small pepperoni pizza, both pizzas with thin crust. I could tell the ingredients of the pizza were all fresh, quality ingredients. Not to mention, the pizza crust!!!!! It's unlike any pizza crusts I've ever tasted. It's crunchy, has flavor, and just the perfect texture for a crust. I highly recommend this pizza place.< /review><username>Amanda Diaz<//username>< Resp>

<review>Had a great pizza (probably one of the best I’ve ever had)and good beer here. We did have to wait a while for the beer and food but apart from that I really enjoyed it. Looks like this place is very popular so be prepared to wait but it has a great vibe with an eclectic mix of people.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Compared to Chicago deep dish........ Mehhhh. But if I'm not comparing, it's pretty good.

I got the new original. First bite was satisfying. But way too many onions. I had to pick out most of it. Especially they are big pieces of onions... Now I have onion taste all over my mouth after finishing my meal. The sauce especially tastes like canned tomatoes... The crust is too bready. Wish it was more crunchy. Didn't like how the texture was like a bread. So when it got soggy it was not pleasing.

I still recommend to those who has never tried deep dish just to get an idea of what it is. but if this place has the classic sausage patty, it would have been awesome because the sausage was pretty good.</text>

Once the sun went down it got chilly quick and they happily moved us inside. Our server, Paige, was friendly and accommodating.

The pizza was fantastic! My husband especially loves deep dish pizzas but we have a hard time finding a place that cooks the crust on them well. This was it! The crust was cooked all the way through the middle, just crispy on the outside but not overcooked at all. We ordered a small, half heirloom, half bixby. (So nice that they allow that!) A small was perfectly sized for two hungry people who had just walked from the hotel.< /review>< Pictures>

Easily the best pizza place in town! I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish, but there's is darn good. Also, you can get any of their signature pies in either style if you prefer. The make-your-own option also means you can have it however you'd like! Friendly staff and nice ambiance, but they deliver if you just want to eat at home.</review>

<text>I went for thin crust and it is by far the best pizza I've had in Monterey to-date. Great sauce, cheese, and quality other toppings in addition to a fabulous crust. I look forward to trying the gluten free crust one of these days!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

DEEP DISH PIZZA. If you're in Monterey for a weekend try this place out. It's a local favorite for sure! I was here when they just started up and it has been growing to be such a popular place. The crust and ingredients are so great! You gotta have this pizza.< /Review>

The one time I ate there was fantastic!!! I’d give their food a 5, for sure!!! Great deep dish and sides!
But..... I used their waitlist app, because they don’t take reservations, and their app lied and really ruined our evening... before leaving our house, the wait was 15-20. When we arrived, they said it was 55!!! Seems like this waitlist app is a scheme! We paid a sitter $20 an hour and had to head home...< /Review>

We waited 80 minutes from placing our order and never received our pizza. Our waitress certainly tried to make the best of it and offered a free small cheese pizza the second time she came to apologize to us for the wait at about 50 minutes, but the 15 minute ETA she gave us for our order came and went and at nearly 9:20 at night we just couldn't keep waiting for pizza that was apparently never coming. People seated long after us were getting their orders, and a steady stream of to-go orders also appeared to be prioritized over our table.
I've been here before and the pizza is delicious, but this is a major failure in service/logistics and I will not be returning.<//text>

My family tried the thin crust and deep dish pizza and were blown away by how good it was. We are from Chicago where good pizza is all around us, but I have to say that we could not get over how much we liked Heirloom better than Chicagos. The ingredients are fresh, the crust is perfectly crisp and light,  and cooked to just the right wellness. I'm not sure we'll ever visit Monterey again but my family will never ever forget how good Heirloom was and how much we'd like to have it again. Well done!<//Review>

Beets were my fave and marinara with cheesy bread was phenom. Enjoyed the deep dish potato and meatball, but honestly loved the thin crust pepperoni we ordered most of all. Crusts were on point.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>We love the pizza here. It is more pricey than your average pizza place but for good reason. These are great quality pizzas with creative toppings. We've only tried the thin crust pizza but that's only because we're not too hot on deep dish in general. We can vouch for PB&G, arugalala, bbq slam, Bob Marley, pesto potato, butternut, and a few others we can't quite remember.<//text>< Pics>

Really delicious food. It's very popular and the overall size of the restaurant is small so be prepared to wait a bit to be seated but it is definitely worth the wait. I had the baked wings which were crispy on the outside but moist and perfectly cooked on the inside. I also had a thin crust pizza with custom toppings and it was top notch and very unique, you can't get a pizza quite like this anywhere else in Monterey. The selection of beer was small but all great choices. I will definitely be eating here again.<//text>

<Response>None</Response><review>Really busy hotspot, lots of to-go orders, I really don't understand why people like this pizza so much, the sauce was great and the ingredients okay, but the crust was terrible. Dry, hard, cornstarch taste. I won't go back unless they change up their game on the crust.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

The pizza was very good, you can have every pizza as a deep dish or thin crust. They also have some veggie options. They would sell half pizzas too so you can order two different halves. We had a large pie, of two different halves, for 3 adults, and had leftovers to take home.</Review>

Lovely location, lovely staff. Charming interior. But the pizza was simply fantastic. Fresh and tasty ingredients is a winning formula. Highly recommended. Just go. Your taste buds will thank you.</review>

<Text>Just got back from an amazing meal. Might well be the greatest pizza I've ever eaten. The slider pizza on thin crust is a revelation. The garlic gloves really elevate the pizza (which has a perfect crust and cheese ratio) to something special. Server was great too, it's well worth the money if you're in the area.< /Text>< Name>

<text>I was excited to finally go try this place and was disappointed. Our waitress was lovely and friendly and asked us if it was our first time there, I said"yes!" Knowing that this was our first experience should have alerted her that it is a good idea to do your best to make it positive. So we ordered the broccoli app and the goat cheese/sausage/arugula/butternut squash pizza. She came back after a while and said the timing was off but here was the broccoli. I didn't know what that meant. The broccoli was good. Then about 10 minutes later we get the pizza. It looked burned on the top - like all the cheese was crispy. Now with regular cheese that might be ok, but it was goat cheese and that is supposed to be fresh and warm, not crispy for sure. We started to eat it as we were STARVING. It didn't have much flavor but I was assuming that it was because it was burnt. So when she came to check in and asked how it was I gave her an unenthusiastic "it's good...." hoping she may clue in. Then at the end when she came to pick it up to put in a box I asked: "So it is always this burnt on the top....? seems a little overdone..." She responded that actually that one was overdone as they kept it in the oven to give us time between the broccoli app and pizza. What!? So she knew it was burnt and still served it to us. I then expected her to offer a discount or even to NOT charge me for it, but no I got the full bill and no apology or credit. I won't come back to this place. If they had offered me a refund or a discount for the burnt pizza then I would have given them a second chance. The waitress should know better - that is not good customer service.< /text>< Pics>

The best deep dish pizza I've ever had, and I've had the ones in Chicago! Friendly staff, good prices too. My family and I were just passing through but if are ever in area again we'd definitely return. You gotta try it.</review>

It was good and I'm enjoying it for the most part, but over hyped.  Some people claim their deep dish is better than Chicago Deep Dish, but I don't agree, though it is vastly better than chain pizza places attempting to do deep dish.

They do have various discounts, which is appreciated.</Review>

<Text>This is the newest, hippest pizza in Monterey! I've eaten here three times. It's consistently fantastic pizza. The deep dish is my favorite crust option. As far as I'm aware, there's only street parking available, and it can be pretty busy during the dinner rush, so call ahead or order out!< /Text></record>

Fantastic tomato sauce.   Very tasty.  The only minor negative is the crust was a bit bland, but the sauce definitely makes up for it.</text>

The food was good but as soon as the globe of blue light turned on, on my table, I got distracted because I was trying to look for one on Amazon. Could not find it though. Cool ambiance.<//Text>

Deep dish done right.  Its actually deep dish pizza not just 2 inches of crust with some toppings like alot of other places.  The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful.  The first bite was heaven. Loaded with cheese, sausage and pepperoni with a pizza sauce that was so good. The chunks of tomatoes in the sauce were delicious and juicy and I dont like tomatoes.  It takes about 30 minutes to make one so dont be in a hurry when going there or order ahead.
It's a small place with seating of about 40 maybe. There is also outdoor seating.  It's a cute place with a little bar in the front. The people were friendly and our server was very helpful and explained everything well. I would have probably given 5 stars if they hadn't run out of the wedge salad and if it hadn't been cold in there.  If I wanted to be cold I would have sat outside.<//review>

<Review>Super friendly cool vibe, and very family friendly which is what we needed. The staff was very nice and attentive to our large party. The food came out promptly. The pizzas themselves were pretty good as far as pizza goes, though I'm a native New York city girl so I'm very biased. The Bixby pizza was my fav cause it didn't try to be NY, it was Chicago style. Kids loved the cheese and pepperoni. Definitely a place we will visit again.<//Review>< pics>

I don't think I'll be going back because of the absurd prices ($18 for a small pizza!?), but the pizza was quite good. The service was eh, the waiter kept checking on us over and over...

The vibe here was very chill. We ordered a thin crust pizza and we were not disappointed! The crust has a bit of corn meal on it and was super crispy.< /text>

<review>Wow. I haven't had deep dish pizza this good since I moved from Chicago 28 years ago! Chicagoans will know there are two styles of deep dish pizza: Uno pizzeria style—a high-sided pizza crust filled with extra toppings—and Edwardo's or Giordano's style—a *stuffed* pizza, with a thin extra crust on top, topped with crushed tomato sauce. The latter is my favorite. Heirloom Pizza Co.'s pizza is a hybrid. It's a high-sided, filled pizza, like at Uno pizzeria. But it's filled more substantially than Uno's, and looks (and tastes!) very much like Edwardo's/Giordano's. I ordered mine with meatballs, onions, bell peppers, and fresh basil (which came as a shredded garnish on top), and it was fantastic! A small pizza has 6 substantial slices, and three were enough to fill me (with no apps or salad). The restaurant itself is comfortable and charming, with about a dozen tables seating 2 to 4, a bar area, and friendly staff. In the dimly lit dining room, you'll feel comfortable in street clothes or in something a bit fancier on a night out. The only improvement would be to accept waiting list requests by phone (currently you can only get on the list via the web site—no luck for those of us without smartphones). If I'm ever back in Monterey, Heirloom will be at the top of my dining list.< /review>< Rate>

We took our pizza to go, but the interior had great design and a relaxed atmosphere. Definitely looking forward to dining in next time.

As for the pizza, we ordered a deep dish "arugalalala" and it was ex-cel-lent. Fork and knife pizza for sure, unless you have the desire to use a pleathora of napkins. We are definitely coming back to try their other deep dish offerings, then maybe we'll move on to the thin crust selection...maybe.< /Review>

Probably the best pizza in Monterey. I had a thin crust Napoli pizza and it was something else. Those spices were amazing. Also, the garlic bread was top notch.<//Text>

<Text>If a hipster could become a restaurant it would be this place, I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I went here with a group of friends with a glowing recommendation from another friend (whose judgment I now question deeply.) I will state the positives first. The pizza was ok, not great but it was good and in a unique kind of way. Visually the restaurant looked appealing, but that was the extent of it. If you are really into clean, organic ingredients, and knowing where they are sourced this place might be for you. If you are not int that, or paying 3x what the meal is worth for that kind of product this place is not for you, it was not for me. So now let me let you in on why this place barely skated by on a 2 star for me. My meal was $45 for a small pizza, a salad and a soda. I was not impressed with my pizza, as there are many places i feel do a great job at a better price. As I said, this place was ok not great. My Cesar salad was ok. The soda (a fair trade soda) was good. My other friends that were with me did not like their pizza enough to even take the left overs home. The service was fine, with the exception of the awkward service provided by what I think was the owner. When we came in this person was seated at the bar watching tv in a dirty mad hatter's shirt and jeans. when he got up and asked us "how many?" we all had the same reaction of awkwardness. he clumsily went and cleaned a table and gestured for us to be seated. Judging by his appearance and that the tv was pulling his attention he did not seem to have much pride in what he was doing. Finally, it was uncomfortable. It was a chilly night, and over head was a massive fan on full tilt inside the restaurant.  It was just as uncomfortable inside as it was outside. The women in our group were really off put by this. I assume the circulation was necessary as the space was small, but it still was not comfortable. This place gets 2 stars because it is unique in its offering, and the servers were friendly. For the quality of food and service I would have expected to pay $15 for my meal, and at that price I might frequent this place. As it stands I wish I had spent my time with my friends in ANY other restaurant in the area.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1519369827248, 'text': 'Sorry about your experience, justin. Most find our menu to be a good value. A small, loaded signature pizza easily feeds 2, sometimes 3 for $20+ tax. if you wanted the fan off, all you had to do was ask.'}</Resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) Had dinner here with my family. We were able to go without a reservation after waiting for 5 minutes. We had a pan fried cheese / garlic bread as a starter, very tasty. My youngest son had a caprese salad as a main course. Very tasty, with different types of tomato, soft mozzarella, lots of fresh basil and olive oil. We, my wife, I and my oldest son shared a large pizza. This one was half Napoli and half heritage, with the thin crust. I have to say, these people know how to make pizza's. I didn't even eat them that good in Italy last year. Very thin base, crispy edge and not overly topped. There was a little bit of spicy in it and all flavors were easy to distinguish. The pizza was big enough for the three of us. I found the restaurant itself tastefully decorated and there was a pleasant buzz inside. They serve fine wines and tasty specialty beers. The staff were friendly and attentive. I really recommend this restaurant!

Met mijn gezin hier gegeten. We konden zonder reservering terecht na 5 minuten wachten. We hadden als voorgerecht een pangebakken kaas/knoflookbrood, erg lekker. Mijn jongste zoon had als hoofdgerecht een salade caprese. Heel smakelijk, met verschillende soorten tomaat, zachte mozzarella, lekker veel verse basilicum en olijfolie. Wij, mijn vrouw, ik en mijn oudste zoon deelden een large pizza. Deze was half Napoli en half heritage, met de thin crust. Ik moet zeggen, deze mensen hebben verstand van pizza's maken. Zo lekker heb ik ze zelfs vorig jaar in Italië niet gegeten. Hele dunne bodem, knapperige rand en niet overdreven belegd. Er zat een klein beetje pittig in en alle smaken waren goed te onderscheiden. De pizza was groot genoeg voor ons drieën. Het restaurant zelf vond ik smaakvol ingericht en er hing een gezellig buzz binnen. Ze serveren fijne wijnen en lekkere speciaalbiertjes. Het personeel was vriendelijk en attent. ik vind dit restaurant echt een aanrader!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) 5 🌟, I have rarely eaten a pizza of this quality 😄, it's good and hearty, from home. Only pleasure. Home on top, it was busy, but everything is well managed.

After comparing lots of quotes I chose IRBIS based on their overall competitiveness. Vadim and his team did a superb job for installing a 2-stage dual fuel heat pump system and all the duct work which replace my 30 year old furnace. The installation process was very professional and their are very careful with details. They are very responsive, prompt in the whole process. They also did a great job in bringing the noise down. It is much much much better now!< /Text>

<text>Absolutely phenomenal service. Our heating was broken and was blowing fuses. 3 technicians came, but, could not figure it out, so, suggested a costly replacement of the whole heater. Oleg from IRBIS HVAC was the only technician who succeeded in root-causing and fixing my heater at fraction of the cost. Thanks Oleg! Thanks IRBIS HVAC!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I reached out to IRBIS because of seeing all of the good reviews online, and they really assured me their quality of service. They are responsive and was able accommodate my same-day service request. The root cause of the issue with our furnace wasn't diagnosed at their first visit, but they sent us a senior technician to make sure the issue is fully addressed and fixed. I'm impressed that the senior technician identified the root cause (which is not an equipment failure but an electrical dis-connection issue) and fixed the issue within just minutes. He explained that although the estimate of cost is based on control board replacement (which is diagnosed by the first technician and with a higher cost) but they will charge us by the service to connect back the ground wire. I appreciate their company's candidness and honesty.< /Review>

why would I highly recommend "IRBIS HVAC and Appliance Repair"?

(1). response promptly - the most important thing to me
My HVAC stopped working on 8/15/2020 Saturday evening when the outside temperature was 104. On 8/16, I contacted 3 different companies via phone call, voice message and online scheduling. IRBIS HVAC was the only company who called me back on 8/17, Monday morning to schedule the service time on 8/17 afternoon, and called me again to confirm the schedule on 8/17 around 5:00PM. This is really impressive to me!

(2). technician showed up on schedule and super helpful
Mr. Vadim Vechkanov, the technician from IRBIS sent me the text message before he arrived. He showed up on schedule. After arrived, he checked out the Air Conditioner, the thermostat, the air filter, etc., ran the test with the test set, and quickly located the failing part, which was the aged capacitor. The AC was back to normal and ran well after the capacitor was replaced. Vadim also tested the temperature from the vent to make sure it is cold enough.

He advised me the importance to clean up and maintain the clean environment around the AC. When I asked him a favor to help change a battery, he was glad to help me out. I really appreciated his job.

BTW. the other 2 companies still did not contact me while I am writing this review.<//text>

Called IRBIS HVAC to repair my furnace.  The nice lady, Carol, took my information and was able to send out a technician the same day.  Francisco was polite , well-mannered, and also used shoe covers so he would not track dirt into my house.  He was able to make an accurate and honest diagnosis, explaining in non-technical, easy-to-understand terms.  Placed an order on the spot for the required part.  Also made a temporary fix so that I would not freeze to death while the part came in.  One week later, he installed the new part, and the furnace is back up and working.  He was also nice enough to provide a special tape to better secure my air filter.  Francisco was prompt and responsive, his work is of good quality and reasonable cost.  It is all of these small touches that are above and beyond the call of duty, and when put together, make IRBIS HVAC an outstanding company to do business with.</Text>

<Review>Any issues with any appliances or installation you can blindly call IRBIS. They are prompt and have a very reasonable pricing. They also stand behind their service. Any issues get resolved the same day or the next, utmost. Ryan is an amazing guy. Very friendly, respectful and polite. He explains what he's doing and why all along the repair/installation process. After he's done working, he'll leave the place clean. And the best part is he's always smiling even at the very tail end of the day at 9:30 PM. Highly recommend these guys.<//Review>< pics>

Tim and his team really did a great job. They were very prompt in getting the right parts and the guy who did the servicing was excellent. They thoroughly diagnosed and helped fixed the HVAC. The guy went extra mile and cleaned the tubing in the attic and outside mesh of the HVAC. Getting an appointment was simple, prompt response time. Really happy with their service.

Ryan has been very prompt in his responses. He is also extremely thorough and detail oriented in his work. Our unit is pretty old and trying to get the best efficiency out of it takes quite some effort. He came in on multiple occasions to check the efficiency after recharging the refrigerant. The performance is getting there! Will certainly recommend IRBIS to someone who is looking for a professional and reliable HVAC tech.< /Text>

Derek has done a fantastic job to not only diagnose and fix the AC but also went above and beyond helped check and replace the air filter and inspect furniture etc. Further he helped me installed two Nest thermostats. Note: I never checked any of these for the past 16 years until the AC stopped working and I was preparing to replace the whole AC. But Derek figures out the issue within 5min and fixed it after 30min. He is a solid professional with great customer orientation and after learning I haven’t changed the air filter for years and had no clue, he went out to purchase a new one and brought back and installed for me. I am very happy. Thanks a lot.</review>

Overall very satisfied. Their response time is unrivaled compared to their competitors and Tim quarterbacks the job nicely. At first I was disappointed because Francisco brought the wrong equipment so the job had to be rescheduled which caused me to miss additional work time. But they followed up when they said they would follow up and returned in just 2 days. Francisco did an outstanding job on a task that turned out to be of much greater scope then originally planned. After seeing all the work he did, best $425 I could have spent!<//text>

These guys are professional, competent, skillful, friendly and flexible. Our A/C unit had a leak and slowly leaked Freon. As a result, the air is not as cold. Tim and Ryan serviced the issue. Firstly, they were very on time and communicated very well through text to coordinate the time to meet. Second, they looked my system for 10 minutes and found the issue/leak. They fixed the leak and recharged the Freon fairly quickly. In a couple hours, cold air is coming out of the unit again. From time to time, we were carrying on a very pleasant conversation. I really enjoyed their presence and highly recommend their service to anyone. And best of all, I got a lot of quotes for the issue, their price is very competitive. I felt like I got great value for my money. Thank you, Ryan and Tim!</review>

<review>The team at IRBIS is amazing all around. From their response time, pricing, and quality of work, everything is top notch. I reached out to them initially to request a quote for replacing an AC unit in one of my clients' homes. We were able to schedule the visit the next day, got the quote shortly after and hired them to do the work. After meeting with them compared to the other company we reached out to, IRBIS was a no-brainer. Vadim, who came out to do the inspection, was great with explaining their process and the work that needed to be done.

Their work was very thorough and they were sure to keep everything tidy and clean during and after they were done. Since this experience, both my clients and I have high regard for the work IRBIS does and have recommended them to others as well. I will definitely be giving them a call next time I'm in need of their services!<//review>< Pictures>

I had a good experience with Irbis and their service personnel. Polite and very professional. Came quickly and only worked on the problem. Didn't talk about any other stuff that some contractors do like comment about the house or other things that are broken.

They gave a decent price for the repairs - not the cheapest but I liked the professionalism and how he explained the work to be done. Came back and then fixed the problem. Looking forward to enjoying the fixed duct work and better airflow around the house. Thanks Vadim and Francisco.< /Text>

It seems that my original experience was just an exception.
Tim contacted me himself,  soon had the parts and Vadim fixed the issue promptly.
I won't hesitate contacting them again for any issues, they actually do follow through and strive for customer satisfaction.

Irbis did an excellent job installing a new furnace and AC unit in our house. We have had many different companies and contractors over the years, and often, we have found ourselves frustrated about lack of care and quality that we received.
Irbis are among the best, if not the best company we have worked with so far. Most important is that they demonstrate throughout the entire process that they care.
Vadim is knowledgeable and he worked diligently to identify a system and configuration that worked for us. He was super responsive and answered all follow-up questions, prepared adjusted quotes and in the end, delivered exactly what was promised. The office is responsive as well.
Oleg and Sergej did the onsite work, and they are knowledgeable and qualified. They worked super hard, and when the job took a day longer than expected, they both showed up on Saturday to complete everything.
We are super happy about the final quality and strongly recommend this exceptional company.</text>

<Text>I had a dryer that did generate any heat. IRBIS was prompt in responding and scheduling the appointment on the same day, a Saturday.

The tech was 45 minutes late.  The technician diagnosed the problem to be the heating element and replaced it. When the dryer was turned on, the coils lit up and the dryer seemed to be ok, when it was run empty. Half an hour later after the tech left, I put in washed clothes and there was no heat. Same problem as before.

Contacted IRBIS and now trying to schedule an appointment for Monday.</Text><Date>1552244663649< /Date></record>

1. They quoted $159 - $185 for 2 items repair and I double confirmed before I booked appointment. But after they fix 1 thing, they charge for $159.
2. $159 for clean the washer drain pump filter, as far as I know it only takes a few minutes. This price is definitely a lot higher than industry average.
3. They came to checked the AC fan problem, and concluded it is furnace control board issue. The technician does not even checked the furnace, how can he root cause the issue?

BE CAREFUL guys! They will rip you off</text>

Music was great. However bar service was horrible we were being over prize and then under prize for the same drink. The mixed drinks were water down I asked for a specific tequila and they told me they were not allowed to serve what we wanted to utilize what they had. And I thought it was ridiculous they were charging $100 a table if you didn't reserve a table it was standing room only. Some people didn't show up to the reserve tables so they were empty and they did not make exceptions to cater to us people who were standing. Overall I give them one star. I also forgot to mention they charge $10 for parking for unsupervised parking lot. When I went to retrieve my vehicle the gate was locked and no one to be found to open the gate until I complain to the owner.< /Review>

I purchased a dealsaver coupon for them so that I can try them out. Their prices were very good nothing over 12 bucks.  My husband ordered the flautas and my son ordered the enchiladas and I ordered the garlic shrimp and they all came with beans and rice. We all liked our food and will probably go again.<//text>

<Review>This was our first trip to Walmart Market and I went with my wife and adult daughter.  They have a better feel for grocery shopping than I do because they shop weekly and felt that the prices were reasonable enough that they will go back. I still like Costco better, however,  for the things I regularly buy.<//Review>< Rate>

I wasn’t expecting much when I came into the store today. Just get my items, pay and go home. But I had one of the loveliest shopping experiences at this store! Thanks to Narsi, she was super helpful in assisting me find the items I needed. She was committed to great service and was very friendly. She truly cared about what I needed and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great experience. Hands down one of the best Walmart trips I’ve ever had. Thank you Narsi!<//Review>

We went in at 8:45 p.m. not a lot of people.  However inventory stocking was taking place so that was a little too much to have to deal with.  I believe the store closes at 11:00p.m. so I wonder if waiting a while later is an option. Store overall was clean but not gleaming.  Bathroom was clean.  Checkout time was good.  The cashiers were friendly, focused, and bagged quickly!  Making it out was a BREEZE!< /Review>

Great service at the pharmacy counter.

For regular store, it's nice they have a single line to get through the check out, goes nice and fast. Always like that better than guessing which line may be faster.<//text>

<Review>The employees  here aren't helpful or knowledgeable about anything they carry. I asked where something is and they say" on an aisle over there " and point.  Do not small talk with cashiers they stop what they are doing. The manager is very friendly a young Hispanic gentleman was such a help when they over charged my card $27. Good for bakery sweets, snacks and drinks . But for vegetables and fruits its either great or disgusting.  No turmeric roots or fresh basil . Sometimes its bare as bone. But if your looking for cheap preservatives and unhealthy food this is great place.<//Review><UserId.>110134569020202822297<//UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

By far you cant beat the prices compared to the other grocery stores in the neighborhood but the prices comes at the sacrifice of customer service and overall experience.  When this location first opened it was a great experience but now it's just downright bad. They never have shopping baskets at the door - you always have to get them from the parking lot and the handheld baskets are all gone.  I complained to the management team and that was dismissed really fast with people have stole all the handheld baskets - wow.  This store does have everything I need and the prices are perfect but I cant go here anymore because my experience will always be BAD.  However they are the only location around this area offering Patty Pies and Cobblers so this is the exception for me - I'm literally in and out.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

A Walmart is a Walmart, except for its employees. This location has a great staff, welcoming atmosphere, and and all around fantastic neighborhood market.

Aside from their regular awesomeness, this staff has been so wonderful to its community since the pandemic. Kudos to the managers and staff for rolling with the punches and facing an undoubtedly ever-changing set of protocols for the safety of themselves and the community. Thank you!<//Review>

When it comes to the deli section.... I'm all in!
Good deli meat, cut however you want cool prices.  Beats the ish they sell in the plastic containers.
They have some cool cuts of meat and pre packaged meat that usually sell out quick in the grocery stores
A1 bread section. it's better than most grocers
Some of the fruit is actually cheaper than F4L too which was odd for me lol but hey now i know where to go when i need certain produce n fruit.
I just hate that they're so small</text>

They don't wear their masks and have no real enforcement of themselves or customers.  I know it's corporate air they have to contends with if they end up in Twitter etc. but I'm more likely to shop around and spend more money if I feel safe and not changing course al the time to avoid the dummies with their nose holes exposed.
I Used to go once a week.. now I only go once a month and stock up on a few things quickly.< /review>

Sandra sandra sandra I couldn’t read her name tag thats the name she gave me.. the only cashier at 7am.. so i decide to pay at self check out but never noticed that i was not supposed to. I did get confused because the light at that self checkout was on. My mistake, but Sandra came at me very mad and in a very confrontational, unprofessional and rude way.
Ive been coming to this store for YEARS and I’ve never felt more disrespected that today. She made me feel unwelcome. I hope someone has a talk with her because thats not right, someone needs to teach her how to handle situations in a professional & respectful way.<//review>

I always have a list.  But discovered Star Kist Tuna in oil 12 oz can for $2 and 96 oz jug of Almond Breeze Milk for under $4.  Great buys in the baking and pancake mix section and Milk Bone dog chews.  My dog's new favorite treat.< /review>

It was easy to get around inside but so few food selections. Lots of parking. Personnel sitting at the door making sure ALL visitors r wearing masks.
Motorized carts for seniors. Cashier was so old, like a token helper, she was sitting on the bagging area and was very slow of getting up, after we stood there ready 2 pay.
Very sweet Wal-Mart hires such people, but it looked and felt like a disservice to her and to us having to wait for her to get up to do her job. Maybe retirement is not a bad thing for her.
In any case, it was clean & quite.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><username>Richard Hughes<//username><Text>I have written you before to tell you how helpful one of your employees is. His name is Cody and he works at the Walmart on Inglewood Avenue in Hawthorne California. He continues to be very helpful as I have had a brain injury I need extra help at times. I was also a director of the mental  health program and notice good employees. They seem a little hard to find these days. But there is one other person that I would highly recommend and has been nothing but helpful to me on several occasions. I’m sorry I don’t know Her last name, but her first name is Miada. She is smart, confident, and helpful, all done with a cheery pleasant attitude and presentation. The store overall is excellent. But these two employees are definitely stand out people. Just wanted you to know that you have two unusually great employees. Thanks very much,
Sincerely, Dr Richard Hughes</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Although a big market,  I had a little bit of an issue,  or rather an incident with an item that I ordered on line. It was a mini fridge and I had to pick  it up in person,  which I did.  But there were some little holes on the side of it. I was disappointed and dissatisfied but I did keep it for I know that if I wanted to return it it would've been a pain in the neck,  for they were supposed to have it delivered to the store in 5 to 7 days for me to pick it up and it took them almost a month... well, that's my narrative of what happened with my online order..... stay safe my fellow local guides...< /Text>< Pictures>

Don't care for their liquor policy. They don't come when you ring the bell. When they do come to get the liquor they tell you what aisle to check out in. Then often times the checker forgets to ring up your liquor so you leave without it anyway.< /Review>

I loved this Walmart! At first I thought the guy was flirting with me ☺️.. until I seen his WEDDING BAND! 😂😂 then I realized how fast and friendly he was in getting my package that was ready for pick up.. I spent under 5mins keep up the good work!! I should've gotten his name! Maybe if someone see a light skinned man with glasses in the customer service area you can put in a good word for him👌🏾 Please</text>

Not because a customer raises their voice for not having the proper I D you give them the order.  Have your On-Line orders sent to another location beside this one, that's of course if you don't have the proper ID then do pick up your order at this location because it's not required.< /text><user>108330895113654036073<//user><name>AUTHENTIC 146KD<//name>< gmap_id>

Convenient, has everything I need. Customer service could be better and faster.  Shelves need to be stocked immediately...especially after the first of the month and after the weekend.  Carol needs to be working in the office or customer service area and a chair needs to be provided.  Being a main cashier may be a little too much for her to handle.</review>

I picked up some fresh avocados, tomato and other vegetables to make guacamole.

Wow, Walmart really has great produce and wonderful prices.

They have the best avocados on the market and I've bought some from different stores at different price points. None of them compare.<//Text>

They are not practicing social distancing and if they have carts available they do not sanitize. Was back today and Had asked for a bag after purchasing one and employee was very rude claiming I didn't purchase a bag and showed her the receipt, with no apology I got my bag I paid for. Customer service is absolutely the worst here. I'd give 0 stars if I could! :( still not sanitizing or keeping safe distance.< /Text>

BAD LOCATION!!!! Always empty shelves at this location with product in top stock or in the back so you always have to find a employee to help you out and most times they say sorry were out and then after asking another employee that actually checks  they finally bring the product out...Just lazy employess and managers.... And no carts ever up front leaving you the customer to do there job running through the parking lot to find one... Just bad management of basic market operations.< /Text>

Staff were courteous and helpful. Store was clean. I happened to come during a stocking time, so it was a little sparse in some aisles, but I'm sure that was fixed within a few minutes of me leaving. Parking is a little difficult since it shares a lot with a Marshalls too. Overall good grocery store.< /review>

<Text>I like going there because of the decent prices.  I work for a school district so I don't make a lot of money.  Shopping here stretches my dollar immensely.  Plus they have hired a few of the students from the area so it is always nice to see familiar faces.<//Text>< user_id>

<text>A good place for the basics and suprisingly it feels cool shopping here as the neighborhood market is the Express Walmart experience but the fact the bathrooms are under attended to
And their computers in Customer Service be tripping sometimes is where it's not at. Also why do they disable all the self checkout when they're close to closing< /text>< UserId.>

I always have a positive experience when I shop at Walmart.  I have to drive a few miles more, since there is no longer a Walmart in my neighborhood. The clerks are very friendly and helpful. Today everyone seemed to be especially friendly with the "Hello, How Are You Mam".< /review>

Always out of things. Needs better inventory. Also this is not costco by law they are not supposed to stop you at the door and you have to show a receipt. It is not in their terms and conditions of shopping. You can be sued.<//review>

<Review>On the positive side, usual Walmart good prices. On the negative side, it's a small enhanced grocery store version of Walmart. It's not the cleanest, and the aisles aren't laid out all that well. Very little staff. But still you can get some good buys here.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I waited over 20 mins in line to get a money order. They need to have someone come help if there are a lot of people in line there were 3 in front of me and 6 behind me. Bad customer service. They had plenty of staff that night because they were doing inventory in the whole store. A manager finally came to help after waiting so long he was nice.<//review></record>

Not exactly an organic friendly location.This Walmart has a very limited selection of Organic foods, as opposed to Trader Joe's, or Sprouts for example.

Its about Access to healthier selections. Unfortunately, lower income communities have to settle for limited selection/access to better foods, in comparison to other cities, Hawthorne has all of its "better selection" stores at the city limits. Far away from the heart of the city, closer to the upper class neighborhoods, West of the 405 fwy.

But if your looking for GMO foods with high sugar content, this is the place!! At least your saving money at the expense of your health.</Text>

Annoying they took away parking spots now reserved for police parking. Police can park anywhere they wish but Walmart took away customer parking to favor police over actually customers. Food 4 Less is near by and actually appreciates customers.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Great place , many of my Walmart experiences have borderd on criminal but  much close to "encounters with E.T " & rude and unavailable staff . This is very different,  store is clean very clean , well stacked , the staff are actually available to help you or redirect you  unlike other locations they are freindly & professional , product range is great Store manager George an absolute honour , great with his staff , great with customers . If I wasn't moving towns this would have been my go to store , it's my first day at this particular store and the experience was phenomenal

💯👌  .<//text>< pics>

<text>The issue I have with this location is often there aren't popular items on the shelf like, soap, some cleaning products, and some food items. They often have only 1 cashier working and 6 self-service aisles open on any given day. That is an issue for the elderly and disabled.< /text></record>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>This is a new and well-stocked neighborhood Walmart. That being said, please remember that they do not carry all of the household stuff, mainly food and regular household items such as Night Lights Etc. The staff is not as knowledgeable as one would hope but try to be helpful. For grocery shopping this location is great, parking is much simpler than at some of the other Walmart. It's very clean and well-organized. That's another Plus. As the staff becomes more familiar with their store they will be able to be more helpful hopefully in the future.<//Review>< response>

< Review>
Apparently the organic strawberries were mixed in with the regular ones. I spent time looking for ones that weren't rotten. Went to self check out and instead of 2.97, they were 4.96. Because I was in self check out, waited for mgr. Was told had to pay 4.96 and by the time we figured this out, everything I scanned was wiped out and had to start over. To be fair, the mgr helped me rescan but by this time it didn't help much. They could have just given me strawberries for the 2.97 but they weren't having it. Don't do self checkout because if you have a problem with something it can be a long wait< /Review>

Hands down, the most organized Walmart I've ever been to. Employees were very helpful, the place was squeaky clean, I almost thought I was shopping at Target. Also, you can shave in the men restrooms without no one bugging you. 10/10 would recommend.<//review>

Every time I go here they are aleays micromanaging my transaction in self checkout. I feel like because im black the ppl keep looking over your shoulder. Unless i look confused or lost and am asking and begging for help leave me alone. Its so consistant every time I come to this location but its the only one near me.  I go ot SELF check out for a reason. Next time I'm saying something because it happenes too often</review>

<text>This is by far the worse store I have ever been to and that sad, because I was been all over this world and have been to some counties that are pretty bad. So as I get out of the car and head in I could already start to smell this horrible smell but I thought it was just outside but as I went inside it actually got worse, I've smelt outhouses that have smelled  better seriously it was bad, even my 4 did not want to go inside with me, then I knew why as I got inside. This place was so dirty inside, the floors looked as though they have NEVER been cleaned and where sticky  like a movie theater floor. The look of the place like no one cared about thirty store or their own personal appearance, I was grateful that all I had to do was go the the customer service because if I had to by food there I would have turned around and left for fear of getting sick from anything I would have bought. But you think that's bad wait till you have to deal with any employee there, every employee I tried to speak with was rude disrespectful or just down right mean. It was so bad that I felt as though I should have called the police just to keep me from going completely off on these employee's. When I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor the was worse, I guess when they say lead by example the employees truly follow the example of the supervisor and or manager that I dealt with. So I left and had to go 15 or so miles out of my way to go to another Walmart to do what I needed to. I tried calling to talk to the GM of this store but still have not heard back from this person but if his/her staff to s this way it makes me think they are as well. What really shocked me when I got home and talked to some of neighbors they told me that they refuse to got there because of how bad it is. They complained about some of the same things.

I hope that the GM sees these and realizes just how horrible this store is or maybe I'll get a call back for the Corp people because I called them after talking to the neighbors and then maybe someone will do something about how truly horrible this store is.< /text>< pics>

<Text>For a neighborhood market store it had lots to showcase and was packed especially as Thanksgiving was next day. So it was elbow room. Salt and sauce on roasted deli chicken much and strong like in other of their outlets-  wish they would go slow on it<//Text>< pics>

convenient for groceries and Pharmacy... pretty good selection considering it's a pretty small store. The people working behind the customer service counter were friendly, however they didn't really seem to know what they were doing (as far as helping me pick up my online order).</text>

Most of the time the shelves are well stocked, and the employees are very helpful. I usually shop early in the morning on the weekdays, when it's not too busy. If you wait until later in the day, parking becomes very difficult. With as busy as this market is, I find it amazing how clean the store is.</Text>

<Text>Not as good as selection as a full-service grocery store but more like a Target grocery store with a little bit extra or a 7-Eleven with a lot more.

Nice people and good service or you clean place and all the food is dated properly.
A lot of the general merchandise and toiletries are locked down even an expensive stuff but as it happens with a lot of people shoplifting I guess.  Their service desk closes early in the store closes early compared to most grocery stores 10 p.m.</Text><rating>4< /rating>< Date>

It's a Walmart grocery store. Store is clean and kept. Homeless out front which detracts from the location.<//Text>

Small, neighborhood Walmart carrying mostly groceries, liquor, basic household essentials, personal hygiene (body wash/soap, toothpaste/brush, hair care, etc), and a pharmacy.

This is not your typical Walmart and definitely not a Walmart Super Center. It does NOT carry clothing/shoes, furniture, appliances, electronics, sporting goods, outdoor patio items.

Overall - good prices on food/groceries, liquor, and cleaning supplies. However, there is a very limited selection compared to other Walmart Neighborhood Markets and much smaller selection than the Vons located nearby (less than a mile away).< /Review>

Staff is nice but they always have a hot mess, and homeless ppl go in there to walk around and I'm not trying to be mean but the smell they leave behind is unbearable. A guy sits outside sometimes and plays I believe is an electric guitar and wow he is very talented I think that's the only thing I enjoy about going to that Walt Mart. I only go to that one if it's a must.<//text>

I love this Wal-Mart. The staff are helpful  and really nice. If you can't find something they are there. If you look clueless they'll ask if they can help . Plus omg the prices can't be beat. I love to stock up here.<//Review>

<review>Walmart market the day we went, sunday . the entire store had NO Plastic Grocery Bags. We shopped ..just to leave after the register without anything. How you gonna take over a hundred dollars of groceries home one by one. Without a single grocery store plastic bags. This location is full of issue's. The employees should of mentioned it to customers when you entered store ..not at the register after an hour of shopping.<//review>< pics>

You need more selection. I was so sad to go in and not be able to buy milk or eggs or butter. Grocery stores carry these items. I had to shop twice. Not happy. Please correct this.< /text>

I stopped here only because it was on my way to another place I was going. I've never bought anything at Walmart, and I never will. This place is bad. The aisles are a mess. The cashier that I got was super slow and rude. She made me feel as if she was doing me a favor by taking care of my transaction. And the creamer that I got was sour, it looked more like cottage cheese than creamer. I didn't even bother to take it back to the store. I could only imagine if they are so unfriendly when one is purchasing something, how they might be when you are returning something. I'll just keep on buying from Target.<//Review>

After shopping at the huge, space wasting Walmart department stores I didn't think I'd like this but I was a little wrong. They don't have the most enlightened HR policies so I take that into account when dealing with 'associates'. Now to the Neighborhood Market ....
Unlike some other large chains I've been able to find a few national brand items that I prefer. The dairy and in-store baked bread items are good value. I've also found their house brand OTC pharmacy items are the right quantity and much better price than the other pharmacy across the corner. Heck, they even have hard-to-find, locally made Romeros 10" flour tortillas. I think I noticed ground lamb, very difficult to find locally. Unexpectedly the produce section items are high priced and chosen for appearance than ripeness.
The main downside is that the stores unusual popularity among the downscale set has made parking very difficult, especially for the victim Del Taco next door.< /text>

The staff isn't too bad, but today in the deli section the clerk made me wait for them as thou I didn't need any help. And when her coworker asked her too, she came up with excuses. I don't know what that was about. I tell you how these 🍒 are later!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b43be0dbb991:0x4500547e27e08cfd< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Problems keeping the shelves stocked throughout the day. Afyer 4pm 1% milk and half/half are nowhere to be found. On my last visit, all of the yogurt of a particular brand WERE EXPIRED BY A FULL WEEK! Only go when I have no other option.< /review>

<review>I have to give this walmart a 5 star bc the Cashier Crystal is AMAZING. I’m always greeted by employees and Management when I walk in or even in the store walking around they’re always greeting me. Makes me feel so welcome. So last year 2017 I lost my Father from a heart condition so my head was some place else. I went to the self check out and I totally forgot I pulled out $60. I walked out and forgot about the money. When i realized I forgot I selected cash back it was too late the walmart closed. Here I am mad at myself for even forgetting. I figured who ever took that money needed that money more then me.  Maybe 2 days later I walked into the store and I see the cashier Crystal she runs up to me and tells me she had my $60 and that she ran out looking for me but I vanished so she kept it in the office with my reciept stapled to it. I was so happy. I love her. She needs a raise that’s for sure.  I walk into walmart today 11/08/2018 and they announced that they ran out of bags. Here I am with a lot of groceries and my 5 year old. I’ thinking to myself great I gorgot my bags then out of no where a guy that was at self check out comes up to me and gives me 6 bags. I was so greatful. He is AMAZING too. I wish I read his name tag. I love this place. Amazing people and Amazing service.</review>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>The staff at this store is the reason for 5 stars. Always professional, efficient, and offering to assist.
What made me want to review is this. I left the keys to my Range Rover in the door of the truck..overnight in their lot. An associate found the key and turned it over to a manager. I come to ask the next day and the keys were there. Saved me stress and $$$.
Thank you walmart lawndale staff!

Interestingly...that same Range Rover was stolen from the same wal mart parking lot this morning (5 weeks later). Investigations underway. I remember asking for the keys and being told.."the manager has them, she is not in the area right now. She'll be back at 8pm." Why take lost/found keys away from work?< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Very disappointing to drive out here to make a payment at the their "closed money center". When online it states that it is open. I came here before to make a payment at this time and I had no issues. The employees were taking payments from customers when I came in. The business hours for the money center need to be updated on their website to avoid these inconviniences. The two managers I spoke with were not helpful and did not even try to work with me. All they said was they will correct the hours and that it was their fault but still did not want process my payment. Will not be shopping at this location any longer.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It is busy. They have may grocery types.You have to prepare your self to spend time waiting in the line even at the shelf check out. I found many times, the prices you show at  check out is higher than the prices tagged at the shelf, specialty for discounted items.<//text>

Clean and organized Walmart. However, it doesn't have everything like other Walmarts. For instance, this location doesn't sell the Brita water filters.< /text>

<Review>The small neighborhood walmarts seem to be really good in terms of getting in and getting out with what you need, lines don't seem to be too long like big walmarts, reminds me of a gorcery store with a little added bonus on other items they carry from toilet paper to school supplies, go here if your looking for a quick trip to the store<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

30 minutes to pick up an online order. Store didn't look clean (first time visit and store has only been open a couple years). Employees looked careless. One employee working the desk and one on register. Huge lines and bad attitudes/unprofessionalism seen in those 30 minutes (from other customer interactions)<//Review>

<Review>Didn't really shop there looking for their retail. They didn't know where to find the retail store. Place appeared to be clean and they seemed friendly if unhelpful. A couple of employees couldn't help but ridicule at my expense. Sorry but I'm from outta town, very unprofessional.< /Review>< pictures>

This is a Walmart supermarket not at Walmart like for clothes and stuff like that it just carries food and I like it was nice employees were friendly lots of parking very crowded most of the time I come here but they have a good variety of foods in here I don't think it was any cheaper than a Ralph's or Vons or any of the other stores but you know that's close to where I work so I stop in sometime<//Text>

What is going on with the Wal-Mart's in this area poorly maintained hardly  anything on the shelves or freezer.  Not the brand I know. From the reviews that I've seen I believe the reviews are from people who only know Wal-Mart as is here.  I have been mostly on the east coast and just relocated here but have been to many Wal-Mart's across the country and have never seen them managed and under stocked as these are in L.A. don't get used to this AWFUL state.  WALMART is a great brand and SHOULD HAVE FULLY STOCKED FREEZERS AND SHELVES. I WILL BE CONTACTING CORPORATE.</Review>

<review>I have a prescription that I get filled at the Walmart in the Doral area of Miami. I'm currently stranded in Los Angeles because of hurricane Irma. I called a Walmart that's located "14441 S Inglewood Ave, Hawthorne, CA 90250". The manager at the pharmacy was extremely rude and yelled at me. I need my thyroid meds. They can see that my name and prescription is in their system. She said they were waiting for the approval of my prescription from Miami. But the problem is that the Walmart in Miami is closed. Now I am stuck here without my meds. I have no choice but to go to an urgent care that my insurance does not cover. The manager should have been more compassionate and understood that this was a special situation. She should have tried to help me instead of yelling at me.</review>< pictures>

Obviously a smaller selection of items compared to a regular Walmart. But that's a good thing. Less people, smaller lines, etc. Store is clean and will kept.<//Review>

It's a grocery store, nothing but groceries, and things a grocery  store  has. When I asked a supervisor lady if they carried card tables, she made gestures like she didn't know what I was talking  about, then chuckled and said no.<//review>

< Review>
From the top manager at the store was rude and really  disrespected me infront of other customers. I was there trying to Cash my Check and was denied like I was committing fraud. I work 12 hours a day in construction.  For the people who represent this major company. There should be some changes at this location  . From the top to bottom  please Clean house< /Review>

<Text>Friendly staff... unfortunately they have somebody asking for money in the front of the store everyday. They have a limited selection on food and run out of items regularly. They don't stay stocked up, there is times the shelves are bare. I really miss the albertsons that was an hawthorne Blvd.<//Text>< Pics>

They have construction going on while the store is open.  Which is pretty stupid.  There was only two registers open with at least 50 people in line to check out.  This had to be the dumbest thing Wal-Mart has done.<//Text>

<Text>I guess it was ok seemed like I would be in and out but it is what I thought it was a time of wasted time. They said they would call me or text me once my prescriptions were ready . I walked an hour back from when I dropped them off and they still wasn't ready. It's okay I expected that from them.<//Text>< Pictures>

A one stop shop to buy groceries, electronics, kitchenware, clothes (men, women, and children), bikes, jewelry, tires, flowers, car repair, plants, etc.). The prices are higher in the store than advertised, and they need to pay their employees more money and give them benefits.</text>

(Translated by Google) It is like a mini Walmart there is no area for toys or clothes, so I definitely did not like it, look for another one because this leaves much to be desired to be a Walmart.

<review>(Translated by Google) There were so many places on the shelf that I couldn't buy what I wanted. Pumpkin Pie. Sweet Potato Pie was selling for fifty cents and it was delicious. Avocado was fifty cents, so I bought several. Orange is smaller than Korean mart and not sweet.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) If you are looking for pirate and dollar things, it is obvious that this is not the right store. Do not complain, if you want to buy cheap and be fooled that they are original things, go to the store of .99 Cts.
This store is distinguished by its friendly, friendly staff, it is always very clean, even the bathrooms!
I'm glad to have her near me when I need something.

(Original)
Si se busca cosas piratas y de dollar, es obvio que esta no es la tienda adecuada. No se queje, si quiere comprar barato y que le engañen que son cosas originales, vaya a tienda de .99 Cts.
Esta tienda se distingue por su personal amable, amistoso, siempre esta muy limpia, hasta los baños !!
Me alegra tenerla cerca de mi cuando necesito algo.< /Review>
