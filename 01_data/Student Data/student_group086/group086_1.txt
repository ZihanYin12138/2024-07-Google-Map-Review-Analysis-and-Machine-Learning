Great gym in the winter time, they refuse to run the air conditioning when it’s 90° outside. I literally can’t use my membership until it cools down.< /Review>

I had to close my membership because I was moving down to LA. I had about 53 maybe $56 in commissaries(water, gatorades, etc.) the lady told me that I should expect one final payment on the 15th. I asked her if she could take the money for that final payment out of the commissary money that's left over and if she could cash me out the rest of the money. They had told me "nope" and forced me to buy two cases of water at 56 bucks for both of them. MAKING ME PAY 28 BUCKS PER CASE(24PACK) and still having to wait till the 15th to pay FOR THE LAST PAYMENT.... I only got this gym because planet fitness was still closed but obviously it was a huge mistake I'm never going back to this gym ever complete ripoff don't care about their customers at all< /text>

Equipment is 40 years old and in bad shape. Grease those machines so they flow. It's so cold in there due to running fans. Nothing is aired up smh. They take your money but don't address the simple things like air up your balls cold af in there lose the fans< /review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>The actual gym itself is very nice, small, but functional and well kept.

Sadly I cannot in good consciousness actually recommend you go here. I had a 12 month contract that expired several months ago, yet I am still charged monthly. After they closed for a short time for COVID-19, the charges stopped, and I had assumed that was the end of them. Sadly now that they are reopened, the charges have started again.

Heed what other 1 and 2 star reviews tell you and stay away, there are better options in the area. They will fight with you both on the phone and in person that they cannot for some reason end your contract, giving excuse after excuse. I don't make very much money, and even their relatively small charges every month can be absolutely backbreaking.

To any employees of the business who choose to read this, I am setting up a flag with my bank to stop any future payments to your company.</text><Time>1592290738524< /Time><gmapID>0x80c36477250ca033:0x18b902952b9325e0<//gmapID><username>Frozen Today<//username></record>

Needs a filtered water fountain / cooler. Newly remodeled group fitness area made a huge difference in the vibe.  Very motivating fitness classes led by Certified Personal Trainers (extra cost for classes).
Most clients seem to be there to actually work out- no bench hog texters , or narcissistic fashion show princesses  (no offense) Not a bad gym if you want to get in, work out and not be distracted. Would recommend.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c36477250ca033:0x18b902952b9325e0</Gmap_id></record>

I wish I read the reviews before I signed up. Trying to cancel is literally impossible. You basically have to move out of state in order to cancel. I had moved outside their 25 miles and they will not cancel my membership even when I showed proof of my new address unless i paid my current month the following month plus the fees. And they continue to bill you unless you pay. They wont cancel. What they do not tell you is that it takes 30 days to process from the date your letter is postmarked. They are just looking to take your money. Horrible, horrible experience. Makes me want to avoid any and all gyms in the future.</review>

< Review>
To start off. I use to work at a gym so I know how gyms work. If you move more than 25 miles away you have to send in a certified letter. I did that and Karen the "manager" of this so called "gym" states that she never received it. She is harassing my wife and employees at my previous place of employment. If after reading every horrible review about this place you still decide to sign their "contract" do not give her any "references" she will just harass them as well. I would give this place 0 stars if I could but I guess a bad review and complaint to the BBB will have to do.</Review>

They trap u into a contract that never ends!
They want u to mail a certified letter to some location thats literally across the street but u cant get the address unless the managers there. They will continue to bill u even after u send the letter.
Not to mention the facility is tiny and the treadmills are always broke down. The childcare center is a joke!
Its a room the size of a closet with old gross toys... dont go here!< /Text>

Boycott this gym they are anti military, money hungry jerks they screwed me out of 200 dollers I had to move to another duty station and had to send then a letter why and my orders to cancel account I sent a dozen of this that magically disappeared and they charged me for 6 months straight and would not return my money it's funny they have "Boot camp" with Vince because they obviously don't care about our military they could have helped us out but they took advantage of us being out of state.. I will contact newspaper and make post, comments when and where I can this gym should not be able to do what they are doing.. do not go here save your money they will screw you over< /text>

I love this gym because it has decent equipment and the people are very nice that work here especially the owner of the gym. Most of the time they play good music, and also you can plug in your own device to a stereo that they have in the crossfit room. I didn't mention this, but they have a crossfit room too with so many bars and plates so you can do deadlifts and other practices with the bars. They have multiple medicine balls and ropes hanging from the ceiling to climb. There is a huge bar hooked up to the wall that you can do pull ups on or muscle ups. Also, there is a huge tractor tire to lift. Overall, this gym is pretty nice.<//review>

Took proof multiple times and they lose or dont have it anymore money hungry , unorganized when it comes to paperwork, training, the gym equipment is a joke. Its only good if u live close and dont want much. Tho if u plan to move or go onto service they will not care what u bring in they just conveniently lose or never had it now i need to pay 50$ and prove once more i moved if i where down there id through a rally agenst the place and it would be known sick of these people and giveing them paperwork for them to just lose<//Text>

RIP OFF ALERT! BE AWARE!

Update: (03/04/18) The same exact service they wanted to charge me $50 for, I got it done for $10 from FID’S SMOG & TUNE here in West Sac. Folks, that shows you how awful this place is. Just watch your back when you step on their property.

ALSO, these people are vicious liars! I asked them in person a month before coming here about how much they would charge for an easy oil if I supplied my own oil and filter and they even said $20. So when I actually show up, they want $50. Nice try but I’d rather not be highway robbed of my money.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: (02/15/18) This Review is in regards to their auto service center.

These people will charge you $100 for a $40 service. Be very careful with what you buy from them and shop around first and compare prices before agreeing to their auto service.

I came this morning to them with my own oil and filter for my Honda Accord and even though every place wants $20 for an oil change if you supply your own oil and filter, they tried to charge me an insane $50 for it!

Never coming here again, they have no integrity if they are ripping off hard working consumers so easily.<//Text>

It's hard to find an honest mechanic. I took my 2005 Ford 500 here for a tune up plus brakes and rotors, I supplied all the parts and Greg did an excellent job. Definitely recommend this auto shop.<//review>

Greg has worked on many of our vehicles over the years.  He has replaced power steering box, front struts and brakes on our 82" Toyota Corolla; replaced valve cover gasket, expansion tank, radiator and fan on our 2003 BMW; replaced universal joint, distributor and pulled and replaced motor on 67' Ford 250 p/u.  Very knowledgeable, methodical and trustworthy.  Highly recommend using Greg at Circle A Auto Service Center<//review>

They have our favorite Kombucha, quality produce, and the freshest meats around, especially ground beef. They never run out of toilet paper and have always been super nice. Thank you Hernandez Market for being awesome!

Also, i absolutely LOVE how the staff will sometimes follow my ne'er do well sister around the store. they're so concerned with whether you're finding everything ok. Gotta love the place!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>A very useful grocery market if you're in downtown. They have way more stuff than you would expect, including a butcher, produce section, and dairy section in addition to normal dry groceries and snacks thet you would expect. The stock biases towards Hispanic foods but it is by no means exclusive. This place is often better stocked than the west side Safeway, especially during the pandemic</Text>< Gmap_id>

One of the few hispanic food markets I've managed to find in Santa Cruz. Perfect for getting imported foods and other creature comforts.</Review>

Love this local market. I love the variety of Mexican candy, the fresh meat, ice cream, Mexican popsicles, cashiers/ owners are very freindly and it seems as if they now know me due to the numerous times I've visited this location. Great market, great variety or Mexican snacks and food, salsas, and great staff!!<//Review>

Not only does Hernandez Market save the day with their cilantro, limes, assorted produce, and cans of soup stock, but they also make a tasty pico de gallo; the jalapeños are actually hot!

I love it. Sure they’re a bit up in the price, but I do see some decent deals here and there. Always happy to support a local business. Their employees are also nice. Thanks for being my neighborhood market!</Review>< response>

They aren't open any longer.  There is now a Chicken Sandwich shop in this location.  We were hoping for a good burrito...no luck for us today.</Review>

Holy Guacamole Batman! This place is amazing!

There is care and consideration from the atmosphere to the food we ordered to the price point.

If you haven't tried Craft Burrito you simply must.

If you have visitors coming from out of town, if you're hungry for a huge meal, if you're not that hungry but need to eat something and have extra for tomorrow... Any reason you have to eat out -- go here.

Update 3/19: The owner is friendly and personally made sure we were completely satisfied with our meal.

He brought out this incredible sauce from the kitchen. It has a slow burn but oh, so yummy. Highly recommended!< /text>

Went there for burritos, only to find out they no longer serve burritos. They have fried chicken sandwiches now. It was a pretty good sandwich, but still disappointing. Good beer selection.<//text>

<review>NO longer Craft burrito now Hurricane Rays. Customer service was great. Ordered the  chicken sandwich (extra heat) and fries. Was no line, and a little wait after and was sadly disappointed that both where cold when I got to my car. The sandwich was big, and just ok. I will stick with popeyes chicken sandwich.</review><time>1615690253940</time><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>tabitha whitfield<//Name>< user_id>

<review>Got the Dave's California burrito and it was bomb! Trip to flavor town center. And the sauce is great! I personally enjoy the smokey and BBQ taste of the burrito. They also have 21 local beers on tap. I had the Mango Hefe, which is a favorite of mine. Definitely recommend going. They also have Taco Tuesday and Happy Hour deals.z< /review>< Rate>

<Review>Craft burrito made the best burritos I've ever had... anywhere. Used to go every Wednesday before the Corona scandal. Now they've reopened with all these changes and adding onions to everything and the ingredients are just terrible. Even the fries. The fries used to be so golden and crispy.  Now they're soggy like old fast food fries reheated in the microwave. If you've been there before you will be disappointed. If you've never been before... you'll be disappointed. Please bring back the original craft burrito.</Review><user_name>Ronnie Taranto< /user_name><date>1599681821451< /date><pictures>None</pictures></record>

<text>I decided to try this place on a whim over Flame broiler. I’m surprised at the great reviews. Maybe that was pre COVID? For $8 a burrito bowl I was expecting something similar in quality and size to Chipotle. Nope. I thought it was supposed to Mexican food. The rice was white and bland, and the chicken was bland too. It wasn’t dry at least so that was good. The portion was also small. Filling enough for a small lunch/quick bite. The cashier was nice. I ate at home so at least was able to add some salsa to save it. I didn’t check out the tap selection but maybe it’s a better place for the beer than its food.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<response>None<//response><Review>We stopped by on a slow Saturday night. The place was almost vacant. The Wednesday night special looks great, $6 for burrito and a drink.

We got the double barrel burrito, we should have read the menu slower, it was fine but wouldn't choose it again, especially with the great selection of other burritos!

All but two burritos were $8 and they came with a small bag of chips as well.</Review>< name>

Super solid Calexico comida.  Tacos, burritos and SoCal craft brew. The menu is streamlined but the result is a small selection of well made calexican dishes

I had the nacho fries which come with carnitas, chicken and carne asada (yes that's how they come).  My wife had a bowl - they have custom-order burrito bowls for those of you that are health conscious.

The feel is boutique-sports-bar with comfortable log-bench seating and plenty of televisores.  There's an outdoor courtyard area if you want to dine al fresco, however, there are no outdoor TVs if you're visiting for a game.

Wasn't  packed when we went so enjoy it while it lasts.</text>

Taco Tuesday not good. Very small amount of meat for the crunchy tacos (chicken) and it was dry and over cooked, it was more like a lettuce crunchy taco. i wish i could of taken a picture. took crunchy tacos back and traded for street tacos, they seem to have more meat on them than the crunchy ones. And i was really in the mood for a crunchy one.</Text>

Management is great. They really treat you kindly here. I ordered the enchiladas with chicken and my co worker ordered the California burrito! We left very satisfied and full ! They gave me the wrong order and were so quick to correct it. Definitely a spot worth visiting.<//text>

One of the things that I value is eating in a beautiful and clean environment with great food! This is it, Temecula! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Mexican food. And when your done having a great Mexican meal there’s a great coffee shop next door. A win, win!</text>< GmapID>

Good service and good atmosphere. The food however is Nasty! I ordered the surf and turf burrito and it currently sits in the trash missing one bite. The worst food I have ever paid for. Most disgusting meal I have ever had and I spent 2 years in Saudi.<//Review>

To the angry man below (Justin Jones, & his overuse of parenthesis).. Craft Burrito Co. is one of the best burrito places I have been to. From the moment I saw it was being built I knew it was going to be good, and it did not disappoint.
From the moment I walked in the atmosphere seemed welcoming and well styled. The staff was friendly when I asked about how the business was doing and even came to check on us multiple times during our stay.
The burritos were excellent and the beer selection was great. I will definitely be back for more.< /Text>

They were out of some things we ordered and we were informed after we had paid and were waiting.  The food was really spicy and I am usually a fan of that.  The chicken was dark meat which I wasn't expecting but I know some might prefer.  They also messed up part of our order but gave us a replacement as we were leaving wrapped to go.</text>

They have awesome craft burrito creations, not to mention the fish tacos are seriously amazing and the taco Tuesday deal you can not find anywhere else. Paired with happy hour on beers and the large beer selection they have, this has turned into my go to spot!!< /Text>

Great food and awesome deals *($1.25 taco tuesdays, and weekly specials) and plenty of beers on tap. Even our kids who are usually difficult to please were stoked on their kids meals and chipotle sauce. Staff was super helpful and a pleasure to deal with. I think we found a new family restaurant for burrito nights!  We highly recommend.<//Review>

I especially enjoyed the uninqe beers on tap. They are not shy with portions and they aim to please your taste buds with excellent options. I chose the California Burrito, "Naked" and that being a California Burrito without a tortilla was very filling, satisfying, and delicious.

The location is not easy, but the hunt was all worth it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone; family, date night, or even a quick lunch.

Craft Burrito is grade "A" in my book. I will be back for Taco Teusday!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Name>John White< /Name><Text>3rd time back. Best kept secret in Temecula. Unfortunately, too secret. This place should be packed. Between happy hour, taco Tuesday and Wednesday Craft Burritos combos for 8 bucks with drink. You can't cook at home for this folks. My wife and I had 3 orders of rolled tacos, 3 crispy tacos and a drink for 10 bucks. Not bar sized but full size. We're from Downey but our kids are Temeculans and Murrietans, so any time were here on Tuesday or Wednesday, you'll know where to find us. If you give this place a try, you will be back. Oh yeah, they sell craft beer also. We don't drink, but we eat. Support this eatery. No. I'm not getting paid for this. Thanks for reading.

Excellent food. Great service. Great deals.
To start with Tuesday is taco Tuesday with some if the best street tacos and crispy tacos to be had locally for a very affordable price. I'd fully recommend this place to anyone looking for either traditional mexican food or calimex. Haven't had a meal I didnt like.
Try the bbq beef burrito it's amazing<//text>

<Text>Craft Burrito is suffering from an identity crisis. Is it a craft beer bar that serves burritos and apps or a burrito spot that pours beers? When I read the signage "Craft Burrito Company" I thought the former. When I walked in for lunch today, I immediately thought the later. Emphasis matters because it totally tees up the customers expectations. Today, I am not sure Craft Burrito Company knows what it wants to be.

When I first walked in I thought, "the atmosphere is stellar!" Craft Burrito Co. showcases a great rustic/modern theme. A designer was likely consulted in the construction of the restaurant as the visual polish pulled off here is impressive, especially for a competitor of Chipotle. After such a fantastic first impression I began to think, "If the food gets the same attention to detail as the interior I am in for a real treat!"

For Temecula, It was a colder winter morning - 59F outside at lunch time. Strangely, my wife and I noticed the A/C was on. We opted to sit outside where it was more comfortable in the sun. My wife ordered the "Del Mar" and I ordered the Hot Buggy.

The food came in an acceptable amount of time, It arrived in square metal trays, burritos wrapped up in foil and served next to some chips. Nice touch keeping the trays warm. That may read strangely but it was cold in the restaurant and outside so I appreciated the warmth.

Unfortunately, the food did not deliver. The Del Mar consisted of (undercooked/hard) brown rice, 4 shrimps (really?), and a small handful of peppers and onions. It was such a strange experience. I took one bite and immediately had so many questions... First off, why is this a burrito and not a bowl? Secondly, why make it so large if 90% of it is just plain brown rice? and Third, what is this "craft sauce"?

The menu lays the foundation for a standard seafood burrito - "Grilled shrimp, rice, bell peppers, onions, and craft sauce." Craft sauce, what does that mean to you? My expectations were more aligned with a buttery, citrusy bright marinade to really let the shrimp pop. Instead I got a smoky, creamy, deep experience. A strange blend of BBQ sauce, Cream, and Chipotle Mayo maybe? Not horrible, but the wrong way to take a shrimp burrito in my opinion.

(the workers did check on us and replaced the burrito with a different option when they heard the rice was undercooked ++)

Next was the Hot Buggy. Someone on Facebook posted this burrito which is what inspired my journey to Craft Burrito in the first place. The Hot Buggy certainly was the better of the two choices but I wouldn't order it again. Pork, Potatoes, Red Chili (not green?) and Cheese. A potentially brilliant combination if executed well but it just was okay. The most notable thing for me was the potatoes. If I had to guess, they were browned with the chili sauce. It gave the potatoes a unique bright orange color and an nice crusty texture but they were very heavy. It reminded me of the way greasy spoons some times serve their chili. The bun takes on a neon orange color from the chili powder in the fat. Some people really like that style of cooking ala "The Hat", or "Tommys". I wasn't feeling it. Very one dimensional in flavor compared to the almost intimidating red and orange color.

If Craft Burritos dropped "Burritos" from their brand and menu their reviews may tell a different story - Craft, a quaint little beer bar with decent bites and a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon. As long as the word "Burrito" exists in their name, and they are going after the coveted lunch hour business, Craft Burrito Company is setting themselves up for more bad reviews and disappointed customers.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

They don’t call when the time of appointments, do they even know how to do their job I guess not?! She makes me wait so long for one question, it’s not even that hard. I hope you guys learn to manage your time wisely so that other people like myself don’t have to go through this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text>< pictures>

If there is a negative rating, that is all these people deserve. Getting ahold of anyone on the phone is dam near impossible, let alone reaching someone who actually knows what they are doing. I've filed my provider and recipient form multiple times and each and every time there has been some sort of complication or they've simply lost the form somehow. No two people from this office can give you the same answer. Management needs to reevaluate everyone who works there because no one seems to ever know anything about anything.</review>

< Review>
I called the social worker, Michael Petty, who was on my mom's case with a concern about the care giver Loretta. This care giver got in my face when I had concerns  about my mom's care and said "Your not going to fire me"  and looked at  my mom. My mom just looked down. Four years ago, my mom was at my house celebrating my daughter's graduation. Three years under Lorretta, the care giver, my mom declined. My mom's condition got worse. This women  showed up for the money,  was not that caring, didn't do much  and should not be taking care of other people. When I called Michael Petty, the case worker, to make a complaint, he said "How do I  know your not crazy?" He did not take me seriously. He blew me off. Unprofessional. That was his job to take complaints seriously. My mom landed in a hospital for malnutrition.</Review>

When payment falls on holiday, you need to wait for another 2-3days after. Please improve your system and in case like that, even holidays,  payment should be kicking in your account.< /Review>

It's now 4 MONTHS after the receiver has been approved, yet they've sent her NO INFORMATION pertaining to timesheets. They do not answer the phone. IHSS Sacramento refuses to give their fax number - so forms must be submitted via snail mail. They make sure to focus the training on, you-will-go-to-jail-if-you-commit-fraud, but no time on what duties we can perform, when and how we can fill out timesheets, or even where to go to fill out timesheets online. On top of it they state it takes 4-6 WEEKS just to enter someone in the "system" and it takes at least 6 weeks to receive a paycheck once they've fully processed ones paperwork, which would be ILLEGAL FOR ANY COMPANY IN CA to do to people. The director and people who drag their feet while working there should be ashamed of themselves.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809ac34cbb72a00f:0x4fed4ea147924edd</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My numbers of workers (since 2004) have been compassionate , informative and able to point me in the right way especially in time of extreme need. They DO what they say they will DO in a VASTLY overworked and underpaid caseload. I personally at my top dont know if I could do it - takes a special kind of gal....but if you are patient and go thru the processes to GET ELIGIBLE it is sooooo worth it.< /text>< Response>

<Review>I HSS failed my mother! Adult protective service in Sacramento failed my mother and our family. I called and begged them to help us! I told them that Joanne Levitt was taking advantage of our mother Gloria Stanhope, that she was telling our mom that she didn't have Dementia and that she was taking money from her! Then that Joan (pronounced Joanne) daughter Nikki Leavitt was signed up to be her car provider through IHSS and we were afraid for our mom! They did nothing! iHSS did nothing! I called Med-I-cal fraud and my mother died 3-22-17 because she wasn't being given her medication and Nikki didn't call 911 she called her mom! Then when EMTS came and asked for relative information they gave them my 90 year old aunt first and my cousin told them to call us! We would have our mother alive if APS would have done their job! If IHSS caseworker would have done their job my mother would be alive. All of a sudden Joan Leavitt said my mom made a new hand written will that left her most of what is in the house. My mother was blind! She couldn't write anything that was legible and she had a legal will done by a lawyer. If she signed anything she didn't know what she was signing because she had Alzheimer's! IHSS doesn't care about the people only saving a buck for California. I am heartbroken!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Won't be going back again! The food was okay. The service was decent. The staff was friendly. The post was a problem for me. I was in the restroom, I saw something crawling on the wall. It was a cockroach. Then another ran by my shoe. Disgusting!< /review>

< Review>
My first visit here, staff is really friendly and respectful. Super fast as well. I ordered the Chicken Pho, and OMG it was amazing, delicious, simple, easily just as good or even better than my favorite pho restaurant Keothip. Large bowl and only 7 bucks. My boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai, seemed more of a true traditional dish, he said it was the best he's ever had. What a hidden gem this place is!  Will most definitely be returning< /Review>

<Text>Worse place ever. The bathroom are not clean and the food taste plain. I came from out of state craving for some nam khao and pak ka pao. When I first enter the place, the cashier mistaken me as another customer. I place my order for a to go box and came back to my hotel with plain food. No favorite at all!! Please add a bit sauce and salt to your food! Thank you!
P.S price is high and wouldnt recommend this place at all!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>1<//rate>< name>

Love their three wick candles and their fragranced wall plug ins. I occasionally will also purchase their hand soap for the bathrooms and kitchen.  Right now they have my favorite scent available, Tis the season. It's seasonal. Enjoy the scent during the holidays. But if you do not like cinnamon, I don't recommend it. Has a tad smell of cinnamon.< /text>

<Text>Staff was polite, however currently the semi annual sale is happening, and they sold my 8 y/o cousin a $2 travel size perfume of the gingerbread scent. At 10:30 at night, I started smelling a strong scent, only to walk into her room choking becuase SHE SPRAYED OVER HALF OF THE BOTTLE IN THIS SMALL ROOM. I now have a headache and can’t breathe in the house :) thank you lady at the cashier for offering her this perfume.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I have a serious love hate relationship with Bath and Body works!!! I cant get out of this store without them taking at least $70-100!! every.time.

I should give them zero stars until they bring back Forever Red!!! Haha, how dare they.

But in reality, I seriously buy all my shower gels, lotions, air fresheners,  car fresheners, candles here!!

During their semi annual sale I buy a TON for random gifts throughout the year. Or I spend at least $100 during their $3.25 or 3.95 sales on their seasonal stuff for Christmas gifts.

They do have coupons that can be used and if you sign up online at the counter the salesperson typically will give you like 20% off after you prove you signed up for their emails.</text>< Pics>

Worst customer service at that very experienced. Employee behind the counter rush to me as I tried to use the bathroom slang me I couldn't use it because I hadn't purchased any thing yet. When I came out of the restroom I could hear the guy behind the counter harassing my girlfriend.  They were out of the beer that I wanted so I asked the gentleman behind the counter if I could consult my girlfriend about what I wanted and the owner began to tell me that I need to order or leave now! They ended up calling the cops on me for not leaving as fast as they wanted me to even though I was about to buy something. Don't ever try this place the guys are very dirty behind the counter and the customer service there is atrocious.< /text>

<text>Slow service, uncoordinated, but clean and good food.  Were first customers, had to wait while they finished setting up salad bar.  Next customer in was ignored for 10 minutes.   Kids pizzas came 12 minutes before ours.   Place was clean, even their walk-in.  Pizzas well done.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808fe9813a8de6f1:0x1a2f38d1f54c16ac<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I called once it got close to 12:30 and no one had arrived and when I spoke to the kid (and yes I am using the correct term because he didn't bother to give me an ETA) he said the driver already left and SHOULD be here in 10 mins. Well it's already going on 20 mins past the delivery time and no one has bothered to call and let me know they were going to be late. At this point, the food should be free.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< Review>
A quiet beach away from rush and crowd opposite to electrical or power plant. Kind of vintage look below hill some industry, road and long beach strip. El Segundo beach is clean and not crowded, might be because of covid. Beach area is not commercialized and hence you enjoy more with natural beauty. Good place to spent time with family and kids. To play volleyball and other beach side games with kids and friends. Sufficient Parking space which are paid.</Review>

<review>Decent beach, not very scenic if that's what you're looking for since it is mostly industrial land nearby. Also managed to get my feet covered in a black tar/oily substance that didn't come off very easily.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Beach is quiet. And also, there's plenty of parking. When I went last Friday, I think they were setting up a movie projection screen for a public viewing, which is nice. This is a good spot to chill and meditate. Only downside I see is it's near a power plant. Not friendly to see.<//Review>

Absolutely love this beach absolutely. One of my favorite Oceanside jogging spots amazing to come here especially early early in the morning when it's still dark or late at night my favorite times of the day the boardwalk is really clean ends up right there by the Strand which is in Manhattan Beach excellent place to jog to stop and use the restroom if you have to finish up your job stop and have a drink< /review>

Nice place to visit and enjoy the beach! They do hang gliding off of the bluffs. The visitors center is pretty cool too. They do events there. I even watched a movie at night there. A regional classic!<//text>

Quiet beach but sometimes you can see the black oils on the sands, if you walking without shoes your feet will be oily. The parking is not free and you can not park along the street. You can make fire in the fireplaces and enjoying.</review>

The parking lot is stressful to use. Meters are always broken. Day passes are expensive. The beaches here seem to be dirtier than dockweiler or El Porto beach (neighboring beaches). Also the refinery and sewage places behind the beach detract from the peace. But when you need a beach, this still has clean water and soft sand so in the end it's nice.< /Text>

We went through el segundo beach but we started at Redondo and biked our way to dock wilers beach where all the bonfires go on. It gets crowded on some areas and some people dont understand they're walking on a bike path but even with that, amazing views, ocean breeze, some parts you ride through the city and its overall such an awesome bike path. I would recommend it to anyone. I went with my 6 year old son and he had a blast.</Text>

<Review>Locals beach. Quiet away from all the madness of neighboring beaches. Always a spot to enjoy the ocean, and a shot from downtown El Segundo.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoq6VAqwPn8x_wdUSfP5bIWSXcFaJb7zySeIZF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHY71wrHAa5NMHO_F9EBIeej47uEDDKesPvlGj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc1b2PcFvvS0nPfs5LBpCpEhPZSr8MAP9o03_7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkYX2zGGRpb4R31p1NhFhnZy2_dLYBKCEU7RHQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

This is a beautiful Beach Park. Parking Fee is $3. Takes debit cards.  Great place to hang out. Volleyball nets. Lifeguards. Surfers. Great place to take a nap. Or just recreate while waiting for the traffic to die down. Beautiful clean Beach park. Enjoy. We sure did !!</text>

More accurately, I attend Zumba classes free to the public at Dockweiler Youth Center, Mon and Wed 6:30-7:30 pm.  Awesome workout in a facility that overlooks Dockweiler Beach with panoramic views. SUNSETS ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL!<//text>

Love that it’s way less crowded than any other beach. Downsides are the airplane noise and giant oil rig ship directly in front of your face. Parking is easy - except for that one machine that is constantly broken. Great if you live in walking distance.<//review>

<Review>On a sunny and clear day, very few places are as beautiful as this long stretch of beach.
There's a bike/ running path along from El  Segundo down to Torrance beach.
Along the way, there's beautiful stretches of beach, some areas with huge waves (along El Porto).
The sandy area is wide, and in some parts, is quite a walk until you get to the shore.
The closer you are to LAX,  the more plane traffic you get to see which for me, is always a treat since I'm something of a plane spotter.
The water is cold most times, but you get acclimated to it. The waves and surf can be rough, so good swimming skills are a MUST in this stretch of beach/ocean.
You can find yourself very far from your beach spot if you don't mind your surroundings. Also, if you relax to much, you may find yourself well outside the point where the waves form and break, and swimming back may induce panic if you're not a seasoned swimmer so be careful.
Otherwise, this beach is awesome in every way from just going along for a walk, or spending a day in the water. People are everywhere, and there never a dull moment.
You can either pay and park in certain areas, or like me, just go during the week says when it is not packed and park along the residential areas, but PLEASE DO BE RESPECTFUL of the residents and their properties. Park mindfully, and be respectful.
And your day will be great!</Review><response>None</response>< Date>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>FIRE PITS ON THE BEACH.. what more could you ask for. I have countless memories of late nights sitting around the fire. One of the only beaches around you can have an open flame. I wouldn't swim in the water at El Segundo though because of the power plant being so close. I would just go to Manhattan or Hermosa Beach during the day to enjoy clean sand and good water quality then go to El Segundo in the evening for the fire pits.< /Text>< GmapID>

The no parking thing was so stressful. And don't even get me started on the restroom for the women. Overall the worst beach to go to. Would not recommend it to anyone.< /Text>

< Review>
Forget about crowded places such as Manhattan Beach or even worse Santa Monica, which are beautiful but impossible to enjoy. I’m not a local but happened to be there for taking an exam, and I found this beach as a perfect place for relaxing after my exam. TIP: Go to see the sunset!!</Review>

<review>I would say NOT a tourist attraction. We did visit this beach on winter and it was raining as well, so maybe a sunny day scenario with surfers would lessen the pain of seeing a beach completely violated by industrial building. As a carioca, born and raised in the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, I am accustomed to seeing nature at the beach and treating the beach as a sacred entity. This beautiful piece of pacific ocean had industrial buildings along several hundred meters. It is however, a beautiful beach and very clean, which is my opinion is worth stars.< /review>< GmapID>

This is a slow location with a cheap manager as evidenced by the stale bread the gave me last night. Nothing worse then paying $12 for a stale bread sandwich. Edit: emailed the owner with details of my visit as requested and never heard anything back from them. They don’t really care. Just making it look like they do here.</review>

Not cool! I don't want to sit inside the restaurant right now, so I ordered online at 4:35pm. I was informed to pick up my food at 5pm. When I arrived at 5pm the employees were just standing around and hadn't started to make my food yet. The male worker with the earring seemed mad that I was waiting. He went real slow making the food and kept giving me mean looks. After he finished I asked why they didn't make it before I arrived and they're answer was that they don't need to serve me at all. and wanted to keep my food I had already paid for online. They were mad I questioned them. All three of the employees working on 4/30/2020 do not respect the customer and need to be trained properly. They were very eager to have a shouting match with me, very unprofessional girl working there. I have been eating there for a long time, and I've seen them go through many employees, maybe these three are on the way out too? I bet I get another sandwich soon and new people will be working there. 25 minutes to make a simple cheese sandwich and major attitude too.  All the to-go tables were empty and I was the only person there to pick-up food, the lazy employees get a huge fail.< /text>

My sandwich was better than I imagined! Hot off the grille, the Philly cheese steak sandwich was cheese melting into the roast beef and the peppers, mushrooms and onions melding into a symphony of flavors on my taste buds all wrapped by the rosemary bread! Amazing!</Review>

Another consistent product and service. Con: Shame based gratuity system.  I tip well, and don't need a prompt.  Consequently,  I rarely go! I wonder, if I left them a penny... would they still ring the attention getting bell for you?  I go to the nearby Giulianos... full service Deli... no tip expected.  I tip... anyway.<//text>

I tried to call but it had closed already. I went in the next day to have it replaced but they would not without receipt. I called the district manager who was very  hard to get ahold of., After several days finally we were able to have a conversation. I was promised several coupons for sandwiches for a later date. But they never arrived, when I try to reach her again she would not return my calls or texts. I even contacted jersy mikes corp., and still no responce.

<Text>My dad and I got the grilled pastrami Reuben and Chipotle cheese steak, both on rosemary cheese bread. We liked both of the subs overall, but we both found the cheese mixed with the steak to be overly salty. The steak itself had a nice, light taste to it. Other than that, everything else was good. Nice, clean store and friendly staff.</Text>< pics>

They have some craft soda made by Stubborn that has unique flavors and is really good. You really pay a premium here though for a sandwich. A regular is 7" and is about $9 then the full size is a tad over a foot and it's $15. They really are great subs but not somewhere I would go really often. The value for what you're getting isn't great, it is a sandwich afterall.</Review>< pictures>

This location is a joke. Always run by rude, lazy kids...children, that don't give a single care about the amazing product they're selling. Last time I got sick, but couldn't 100% pin it on the sandwich. This time, a rude polynesian kid with an attitude, smushed the bread while trying to cut it, then places the bread touching a dirty towel,...not before proceeding to slice an almost non-existent piece of roast beef, for a club supreme. Vegetables were wilted and discolored. Now I know this place got me sick last time. It's locations like this that make people still see Subway as a viable option. What a waste.< /text>

The food here is great. I really love the club sub. Second to none. May be a bit expensive for some people at about 8-9 dollars for a regular sandwich which is a bout 8 or 9 inches long. These sandwiches are packed though so they will definitely fill you up more than a subway footlong. Meat is higher quality for sure. Go before June 4th 2017 and buy one get one free sub with a coupon from torrance education foundation facebook page! Can't lose with the coupon! They also have gluten free bread if you're into that. If you don't know what to get trust me and get the club sub Mike's way and just prepare your taste buds for amazement.</Review>

Open late. Staff is always friendly.  Be sure to have cash if you come around 4am, since they have to close and restart their register POS system. Fresh, Fast and Friendly, that's all that's needed.</review>

The people who They call homeless are infact the ones who live in the government housing right across the street from the Jack in the box. So for the people who say that the homeless are the ones who are troubling them they are wrong it's the people who have a home that are bartherin them. As for the service it's is pretty good except for at night going through the drive through,tske's to long and sometimes the food is cold.< /text>

We ordered the mozzarella sticks and the mozzarella stick box with fries, onion, and the mozzarella sticks which were very dry and the cheese was hard. My husband ordered a sour dough jack which smelled rotten and was so dry i took a bite to try it and couldn't even get it down my throat without drinking something. We also got cheese fries 2 each which seem to be fine. Well that nite mine and his stomach started hurting bad and the next day, i had diarrhea all day long, throwing up and had the chills. He suffered with the same issue and its scary cause he's diabetic. Today im still not feeling too good. I know for a fact we got stomach poisoning from eating there. I will not be going to that location again! It's sad because its closes to were we live but rather go somewhere else to eat then to get sick again.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I ordered 3 combo breakfast burritos of the same kind (meat lovers) and they handed to me 3 burritos of entirely different kind (i don't know what that is..stated grande sausage on the seal but not even what that is... cheese and hasbrown running wet, which I really really hate).  So so disappointed...I can't believe I have to throw my breakfast away...<//review>< Pics>

This is an okay Jack in the Box in a bad location. The area smells strange and is surrounded by trash and loiterers. Sometimes the food smells strange, too. The employees seem to be safely using masks and distancing when bringing out or handing over the food during the coronavirus/covid-19 quarantine. This is now largely a hub for commuters using the drive thru, so the unpleasant surroundings and local clientele aren't much of an issue.< /review>

Not the greatest fan of the menu. Would love to see the chicken supreme and frings make a comeback. Also, the taco salad and the chicken strips dinner. Weren't the 80's great? Right after the blew up the clown...< /Review>

<review>Ordered a Munchie Meal. The "Sprite" tasted very off, and had a strong lime scent in the cup. After a few sips, my stomach began to feel some discomfort. The Tacos are good, but I got my Double Stacked Grilled Cheese Sandwich Cold. I think I'll stick to the Burger King at Almaden. 😳</review>< Pictures>

Marcella a cashier was very rude to me I ask to use the restroom and she refused to give me the key! And she wanted me to respect her. I told her I was the customer and she need some self respect! People like her do not need to in a social inviroment. I will never go to this Jack in the box again this world has enough rude and  bad people!<//text>

<Review>The service time is extremely slow in store. They should seriously consider hiring more employees. The is only 2 store employees, 1 is the cook and the other does drive through service. Basically no front counter cashier. Takes forever to order and receive food. Bad/slow processes. They need to understand that this is SUPPOSED to be a “fast” food restaurant not slow<//Review><gmapID>0x808e330d1f0879e7:0x7a9c1b28b2a090b1< /gmapID><UserId.>114365360472203658619< /UserId.><Response>None</Response>< Name>

Though it didn't seem very busy as I walked up to the register and was the only one in line and there was only two diners in the restaurant the MOD made eye contact with me but then went to help expedite in drive-thru it was two cars in before she looked behind her again and said be with you in a moment so unfortunately because Drive u x I always looked at and lobby times aren't I was definitely made wait longer than I'm sure the company would like to have two cars at drive-thru wait to order. What you did come to the register I would describe her General demeanor as short and indifferent. Tacos we're okay if you didn't mind some very bitter tasting and brown on the edges lettuce but at least the shells were crispy. In general coming from an early on background of fast food experience in general I was dissatisfied but probably got what I paid for it as fast food is just fast food<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Lived near here for years. Only ate here because it was one of a few places within walking distance.  Often they close early, only leaving the drive through open. Very disappointing after walking over for a quick bite. Trying to eat indoors rather then take it to go is disgusting.  They don't stop people from bringing pets, not service dogs, inside. My daughter been barked at, lunged at and bit by random dogs, completely unprovoked, (she knows not to touch a pet without asking first), just trying to order food. They also allow homeless people who stink to camp out inside the restaurant. Making it extremely gross to try to eat when you are gagging at the smells. They have to turn off the soda machine from all the people living in the apartment building nearby and their homeless friends who constantly steal drinks.  Save your sanity and visit the Mexican restaurant across the parking lot or the Subway.<//text>

Long drive thru line is the norm.   Food is the usual Jack n Box.
I only go for the Ice Tea - which is watery.  But, they give a Senior Discount and the large is a large size.  But, all in all, Frustrating to say the least . Oh, and they need a new microphone at the drive-thru, they can't hear you and you wind up screaming into it.< /Review>

Everything tasted delicious as usual and they were very helpful in terms of assisting me with my order and fast service.  My only encouragement:  there was plenty of "down-time" including drive thru activity, for the workers to freshen the tables and empty the trash (which was full).< /text>

The drive thru line is extremely slow and ive made the bad call of coming here because of location (near hwy 87). Not only that but i was very specific about my order and even explained it twice and they got it wrong. Theres shady characters hanging around the complex, do not go there after dark.<//Review>

Not the best fast food, but in the late night, its great! Leaving a night of having a kickass time, Jack is the only thing open. But that's cool  because there's hella choices and it all tastes good at midnight. The curly fries are FIRE!</Review>

<review>This little shopping plaza is crawling with homeless people who appear to be wacked out of their minds. Today one woman was sitting on the curb in the drive thru making it difficult to pull in. She didn't care. The parking lot is littered with trash, it's disgusting. I get nervous just going though the drive thru wondering if someone is going to confront me. Go inside or use the restroom? Absolutely not. The few businesses there should pressure the landlord to address these problems. Be prepared for this experience or go down the street to McDonald's.</review>< pics>

<Text>the lady in the Drive-Thru misrepresents what Jack in the Box is. This place has got to be the worst, I look online for pricing and come to the Jack-in-the-Box the prices do not match the online. Jack in the Box prices and offerings were not provided as so number one disappointment. Number two, the lady in the Drive-Thru took 15 minutes just to get to the front. Some fat Hispanic looking lady or white lady heavyset elephant was ready to take my meal away from me like she wanted to eat it oh, but I said I wanted to eat it even more so I stood by my meal. Upon ordering she was not providing no customer service at all took another 15 minute provide food, and did not even smile like she was prejudice. Hispanic is prejudice racism. Jack in the Box needs to take a look at their drive-thru lady that is fat. Have a nice one<//Text><Time>1550725192072<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

The first time a couple of employees came to the window, closed the window and actually hid from sight, called the manager to complain the next day. That was in March 2017.

Same thing is happening as I write this review 10 months later, the sign says open 24hrs but it appears completely empty and there is no response on the intercom.

Based on the lack of cars in the parking lot the workers may have clocked in and then left to do their own thing, or maybe no one was scheduled to work? In which case the sign should be changed to “closed”
Strange way to run a business.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Bought a Jumbo Jack and asked for a little hot water for my cup of noodles and she said No. The hot water was 3 feet from her and there was no one inside. I even bought something and still got denied. The lobby smelled like piss from the homeless coming in and out. Also the patty was cold....I thought hamburgers were supposed to be hot.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808e330d1f0879e7:0x7a9c1b28b2a090b1</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Service is good. Dude in the window was helpful. FOOD IS AWFUL. This is the second time my sandwich was cold and untoasted. Fries always cold. Eggrolls chewy, soggy and barely fried. And my soda had very little syrup in it. Who loves washing down cold burgers and fries and soggy eggrolls with unflavored seltzer water? If you do, go here. If you want food that tastes like it's from Jack In the Box, go to any other location. This one is terrible.<//Review>

Good food at 3 am. Horrible service though. Use during the daytime only. The night crew is pretty incompetent. Also homeless people approach your vehicles on the drive-thru to solicit money or try to get you to buy them food.<//review>

<Review>The last 6 times I have gone there after 10pm they have been "closed". Not normal closed, but during store hours (they are a 24 hour location) I pull up and they tell me through the drive thru that they are closed. When I ask why they tell me their system is down. Do like McDonalds or ANY OTHER FAST FOOD PLACE and just use a calculator. You can still cook. DO the math. Never going again. They're idiots.< /Review><username>Justin Easterday</username><UserId.>103310894368886196585<//UserId.>< rating>

This place is good to eat when your low on money. I live like 2 mins away when I am low on cash boom you can find me here. It is near UPA where you can eat right after school. Subway, forget it. YOU WANT MEAT.</Review>

<text>Sketchy parking lot.  Pulled in to drive thru and after they took the order for the car in front of me, they never returned again to take more drive thru orders.  Six cars lined up behind me and still no service after 10 minutes.  Can not comment on food quality since I was never able to place a drive thru order.  Have to believe this is not one of the top Jack in the Box locations.</text></record></dataset><record>

I am so mad! I ordered a plain jr bacon cheeseburger add lettuce and they just gave me a hamburger with lettuce. I told them there was no cheese and no bacon,so they did it again and there was no bacon! So i went up and told them there is no bacon. Finally they add bacon! This ruins my lunch!< /Text>

<date>1565991375741<//date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) What bad service they give in this place yesterday I had an experience I always visit this place after eating I ask a saleswoman if they give me the bathroom and I treat myself very badly for that reason I do not plan to visit those places anymore. They said ok.If this person who speaks like that I say they do not give them education because they are not sent to a school of manners.
