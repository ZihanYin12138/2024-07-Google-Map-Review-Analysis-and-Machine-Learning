Spent too many hours relaxing at this cafe. They've got every drink you could want as well as a few extras.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating with a few seats that have an ocean view. The only reason I docked a star is because their burritos weren't great. Everything else was fantastic.

Definitely try their avacado toast!<//review>

The burritos are a favorite of our locals and visitors and so we can only assume it was a one off. Let me know next time you’re in so I can better understand what went wrong.

Awesome service, a great ham and cheese quiche, and one hell of a vanilla latte. The owner even brought out my latte! Beautiful location! I'll definitely be back to do some reading and to get some work done.</review>

Kara was so nice to us and gave us the best Cadillacs. It was cream soda coffee pretty much and we loved it; this is a little coffee shop that has no bad things. The pasteries where phenomenal, the service was friendly and helpful, and the view was stunning. Thanks for the wonderful morning!< /text>

<review>Great little place to grab coffee or a quick breakfast. The people there are friendly. The coffee I got was good (I got the cold brew). And the kids enjoyed their breakfast (chocolate chip muffin and eclair)... as evidenced by the fact my daughter was quick to protect her food from grandpa 😂.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>This coffee house is so adorable! The coffee is excellent and the pastries too! The staff is so sweet! The young lady who took my order was nice and then another gentleman came running when my son spilled my food and says “ I’ll get you a new everything”.

This was a solid coffee house near the La Jolla Cove. Because it was a warm day we had iced drinks and both were good. They also offer a few non dairy options for milks.< /Review>

<Review>Jessica was knowlagable and friendly. 2 thumbs up. She was willing to show the units and tryed to fit me in the best unit for. My money 4 stars but minus one star no lights in units so it was hard to see when hall lights turn off. Good gate hrs tho.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Jessica is THE BEST, we had an appointment at CubeSmart Across the street and it looked questionable so my husband said look across the street and call Trojan. Not only are they like $40 cheaper for the same 5x10 unit, they are far more professional. Definitely recommend when you're in need of storage.< /Review><rate>5<//rate>< gmap_id>

Recently moved from one other Trojan facility in AZ to this one after being relocated to Northern CA for work and really enjoy the transition. GREAT prices compared to big storage chains in the area. No rent raises at all so far ........ PUBLIC raised my rent within 3 months of being there!! All around great experience and will be here a long time. Thanks Trojan<//review>

I am dealing with a sick grandmother and they're mad that I left one table in the unit that I still have paid for for the rest of this month what kind of person threatens to charge you $250 because they feel that you left something intentionally when you did not.

Customer service is our number one priority, so I'm sorry to hear that you had a negative experience.

We are sorry about your situation and we understand that you are going through something. When your lock is on the unit, yet it is marked as vacant, then it is implied that the unit is ready to rent again - yet if there are still belongings in it after you claimed it's moved out it causes issues with us.

This place doesn’t even deserve one star! This establishment is horrible, they do not understand nor extend customer service, they do no communicate with their customers. They hire a new person every week and start calling them a manager, absolutely no consistency. Trojan has got to be the worst storage unit in Sacramento. I thought they would be good because they were a chain business but I was WRONG. Finally closed out the storage unit for good today and will NEVER be using this “business” again.<//Text>

This is a horrible company.  Do not use this place.  If you are military do not use them.  Lock and Load storage was military friendly they are not.

I don’t rent at this facility I rent at the one in Campbell, and it’s going through a change of ownership from Instant Storage to Trojan Storage. I’ve talked to Christine on several occasions with questions and concerns and she has been so very sweet and friendly and helpful. Thank you Christine!

<text>I'm only giving 1 star because Negative 25 stars wasn't available!

This place is horrible! They will try to steal from you anyway they can with fees they are trying to charge me with Past Due fees when they don't answer the phone so I can make my payment how I normally do!

Told an employee I've been trying to contact them for over 2 wks and I'm constantly getting their voicemail and busy call messages and his response is that isn't his job to answer the phones so I can make my payment!

Who the he'll taught these people customer service!<//text>< Date>

We looked up your customer profile and noted that you actually have never received a price increase at our facility. You've been paying the $42.50 with insurance as always, then your 15% off 6 months special ended in July, bringing you to the rack rate that you agreed to when you rented. As for the lien on your unit, when the lease is signed and the unit remains unpaid, it is our job to put the unit through this process. We take claims like this very seriously because we value our customers and would love for you to please contact the site if there is anything else we can help you with. All the best"}</Resp>

<name>Kellee Jarvis-Tackett<//name><rating>1</rating><text>In February They didn't inform me that the $40/month I was paying would increase after 6 months. Prior to signing my lease I didn't know I'd be paying $70/month, especially for such a small unit. So in JULY...

(which is only 5 months after I initially signed my lease in February)

I already paid the $40 payment as normal. But unknowingly my monthly payment amount increased. I was totally unaware and they put a lien on my storage unit until I paid the remaining amount of $30+$60 to remove the lien, + another $15 for a new round padlock because they cut off my original lock after they put a lien on my unit. NONE of it should have been my fault. Due to the fact that I hadn't received ANY prior notice via EMAIL, PHONE CALL, TEXT, PAPER MAIL, FAX, etc. of a monthly fee increase... Which was supposed to begin in August not July if I'm not mistaken. On top of that they wouldn't let me pay with my debit card they demanded that I pay with cash in order to remove my storage unit from Their lien list...<//text></record>

Date: November 2016

The previous reviews from 2-5 years ago are not for TROJAN STORAGE but for LOCK N LOAD storage ON FLORIN ROAD LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO, CA which is now out of business AS OF JULY/2016 BECAUSE IT HAS recently been BOUGHT  and NOW OWNED by TROJAN STORAGE.

THIS REVIEW IS FOR TROJAN STORAGE(new owner as of JULY 2016):

I do not and would never recommend trojan storage, not any of them in the sacramento and greater Sacramento, ca area. Horrible people and staff, your items will not be safe with them.

Why can't i  give zero or negstive stars. They do not even deserve a star. I waited after i vacated to do a review because ifear my items would be jeopardize and that they would try to illegally come after me for money.

Trojan storage on florin Road is garbage. I have been happy with the service and kindness of the staff with the previous owner(Lock n Load) of this storage facility for years and trojan recently bought and now own the storage facility.
These New owners never gave notice of new ownership and their transitioning of updating/remodeling of storage units and facility. At first i thought it was an honest mistake such as when they mess up your address so they can force you to sign up for a new lease with them as it was done to me and several other tenants i talked with.

They are scum, kristy and richard constantly lie and back each other up saying they gave you notice via mail and phone call about cutting your locks to install new doors for all storage units and allowing you to be present. They never did any of those except cut your locks and replace the doors as they please without your knowledge or consent. They also never apologized for their errors and get more angry at tenants who are unhappy with their lack of responsiveness and unwillingness to take responsibility to make things right for these "mistakes".

I heard and saw people complain about how they came to find out their units were without locks for several days and were not notified nor given new locks. I even saw first hand several tenants come into the office or talking by their units to each other while cleaning or moving out because their locks were replaced and they were never given any notice ahead of time about replacing doors and locks. So, just Imagine your items basically free to take because the staff illegally cut your locks and left it unlocked for days or coming to your unit to find out the lock on your door isn't even yours and its been replaced.

The staff is all over the place but kristy(states she is the manager) and richard(assistant manager) are the ones i always spoke and dealt with because no one else was there and they refuse to let me speak with anyone else.

Kiristy and Richard are horrible and deserve to be fired because they make excuses and always blame the tenants of the units; both kristy and richard enjoy being irresponsible and disgusting with their actions. No wonder i saw so many tenants leaving(i thought it was only me who had to deal with them being like that). I left as well after giving them chances because i really wanted to believe it was a honest mistake(s) on their part, but finally I was fed up with them after 3 months(2 months but i had to give 30day notice) hearing other tenants stories. but it was really because I grew tired of kristy and richard being constantly rude, no accountability, not giving notice/calls of things being done with remodeling and replacing my lock without telling me and acting in such childish behaviors and blaming it on mistakes and right before i vacted blaming it all on me, a tenant.

I definitely believe the review from the person who wrote a review two weeks ago, as I have definitely had to deal and encountered these disgusting trojan staff members. Do not store your items with them, they will not be safe. Save yourself a headache and money<//Text>

We apologize for the construction- we are currently making site improvements that will ease the customer experience and ensure that our facility is in top shape for our customers. The limited access is in the lease you signed when you first rented your unit. The reason for limited access hours is so that we can ensure a secure facility and so that no one can access the facility after hours- offering extended protection for your belongings. If you would like to get in contact so that we can further explain and get to the bottom of your issue we would be more than happy to. Give us a call at 888-564-7782.

I had an amazing experience here today. The staff was extremely helpful. I purchased a ball python about a week ago and was still a bit confused about what size rodent I should feed it, they helped me select the right size rat pup which my snake gobbled right up. I will be coming back.<//text>

This small charming location is great for food purchase. I buy super worms for my bearded dragon. They have great healthy worms at great prices. The store has different and rare reptiles to adopt or to ogle at. They sell bulbs and other supplies. They are very knowledgeable and helpful.</Review>

Awesome Reptile store! Everyone is very knowledgeable and employees were happy to answer all of my questions, all the employees are friendly with exceedingly great customer service, all  are very welcoming as well. All the Reptiles in this shop are well kept, well misted and well fed. This Reptile shop has a buffet of reptile food, crickets, meal worms, fruit flies, horn worms and Dubia roaches of all sizes. They have various sizes of enclosures as well as enclosure necessities. They carry some beautiful snakes as well as chameleons. I will definitly be purchasing my next Chameleon here.. I won't be shopping anywhere else from here on out, this place is thee absolute best for my lil chameleon girl. Only 1 downfall, which is that the parking's a bit cramped, other then that, this is one Awesome Reptile store.<//Review>

<review>Absolutely the best experience a first-time reptile owner can ask for.  My girlfriend and I walked into the shop in search of our first reptile, and the employees we're the absolute best. We saw our new pet behind a glass enclosure and after picking him we we're educated, and properly informed on how to care and watch out for our new friend. We bought an entire new setup for our Citrus Bearded Dragon, and they we're kind enough to set up the tank for us, get the proper lighting ready, and all this for an incredible price. Its been 2 days since we brought him home and i couldn't be happier with my experience, my girlfriend and I are absolutely stoked with our new pet and the entire experience at the Reptile Factory. 10/10 would recommend this shop.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUfpluLcFwok4WzdBZIZ5ECUR1NVt3YgaTia40=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Small, smartly-organized space dedicated to reptile & amphibian sale, care, & products.

Feed & merchandise is clean & fairly priced.

Animal enclosures are spacious, superbly decorated & maintained, especially the terrariums. Beautiful to admire.

All living creatures (reptiles, amphibians, plants, arthropods, etc) appeared healthy, well-fed & alert. Saw some chameleons, monitors, bearded dragons, skinks, incredible tree frogs & more.

Staffing seems like knowledgeable, enthusiasts of herpetoculture. We need more supporters of this caliber.</Text>

Melissa was so helpful! We bought our first bearded dragon and she helped with our 21 questions and also made it quick and easy for us. Definitely would recommend this place for anyone needing a new friend or wants to gain some knowledge about reptiles! Meet Drago or Drago (too soon to find out)<//Review>

<review>Great customer service! Discovered this place when Petco or Petsmart didn't have crickets or worms. Googled a reptile store near me and this was the best one! Cheaper and had more options compared to other reptile stores I've been too<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Super service always, these stores care, period. I buy a lot of feeders here weekly for my pythons and have never found mites, ticks or anything on them. I can’t say the same for other places I’ve been which is just sad. This place should be a standard for anyone selling reptiles, don’t put up with smelly stores selling sick, dirty habitat ridden and poor animals ever again. Deal with these people. These people love the animals like they are theirs permanently.< /text>< GmapID>

< Review>
They had a nice selection of reptiles, inverts, and feeders, and a ton of great supplies for reasonable prices. The husbandry for the animals wasn’t great though. All the chameleons in the shop were underweight, seemed lethargic, and had dark colors and sunken eyes. The baby bearded dragons were in tanks with too low of heat (it was 90* per the tank’s thermometer) and way too high of humidity. Wouldn’t purchase an animal from this shop because of the health risks of incorrect husbandry. I’d consider buying tanks/lighting though.< /Review>

If you get a pet from there you won't be disappointed! If you end up meeting Anna she is very helpful and will answer every question you have. They seem to really love the animals and take good care of them. :) Also they have a variety of insect, rat, rabbit, and mice feeders.</review>

An incredible place for experienced and beginner reptile keepers alike. Their wide selection of snakes, frogs, lizards, invertebrates, and feeder animals never ceases to impress. The animals are in top notch health, and every employee I've spoken to -at both the Long Beach and Garden Grove locations- have been kind, helpful, and very knowledgeable. I wandered into the Long Beach location after hearing from a coworker that they have cheap bedding/ food that I needed for my new leopard gecko. When I walked in, I was simply amazed. It's rare to find such a small shop with everything as well put together as it is in Reptile Factory. Their invertebrates too! All so well taken care of. Many shops tend to neglect their inverts since they're not as "emotive" or "well loved" as other more popular animals, but not Reptile Factory. Beautiful tarantulas, vinegaroons, and other crawlies were active, happy, and comfortable being handled. The prices were fair for what was available too, I'd be happy to spend more for a new animal knowing it was hand raised coming from such an amazing place. After visiting in Long Beach, I had to see their other location, and drove to Garden Grove the same night. Both shops were exemplary. Please consider giving your business to such compassionate animal keepers. They really deserve all the attention they can get.< /Text>

Very clean and organized place. First time ever buying a tarantula and the guy that helped us out was very friendly and patient. Answered all of our questions and my sons questions. Ended up walking out with 2 tarantulas and a venus fly trap. Will be returning again soon for a pac man frog<//text>

Great service. And very friendly and patient We took in our Ball Python to find out if our snake can graduate from mice to small rats. The girl( sorry but i didn't catch her name) helped us out and she said it was ok to move up to baby rats and she was also able to determine the sex of my snake. Thank you so much..< /text>

Dude at the front counter would rather flirt with chicks than to help a paying customer, this has happened every single time I've been there. They have an ok selection of reptiles you won't find at petsmart/petco, but their service is 3rd rate. Probably won't return here.<//Text>

< review>
Yay stopped in here twice now and love it more than any other place I’ve stopped in because it’s clean af, but even better Carlos and William are so nice about any questions you have, recommending products, and hanging out. They helped me switch my ball python to rats from mice, thanks guys!!
What somebody said previously about them not being like salesmen and pushy is so true. They showed me all their morphs just because I was curious and explained to me all their different temperaments just because they enjoy their reptiles.
Thanks so much for being so kind and having the patience to teach me everything despite just stopping in for feeders!
Rad guys, who love what they're doing and it shows. They deffffinitely have a more personal touch and seen way more hygienic than Jurassic parties down the way!</review>

The quality of Southland Sod Farms’ lawn products is exceptional. But most importantly, their representative, Mr. Renato De Sousa, was very helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  He was patient and explains things clearly.  Thank you, Renato...you are truly the best!<//Review>

Juan Prado fielded multiple questions I had about my lawn and was even nice to give me a custom watering scheduling and walk me through it ever step of the way including when to fertilize and all the pre/post work for my sod installation. My lawn is so green it almost looks artificial. Thank you Juan and Southland! Great experience! A++++!!!!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Some how the glowing review of Renato I just gave in Bird eye ended with “sorry we did not meet my expectations”. I must have messed up some how, as I wanted to rate him on a 1-5 scale a perfect 10.

If possible, you can change my previous review in Bird Eye to score max stars.

In case you can’t, here is another!

Renato made an appt for today and showed up as promised. In just minutes he was able to explain just a few simple things that I am confident will take my grass from Good to amazing!

He is such a great brand ambassador and you can tell he really loves what he does! His positivity, is infectious!

With Renato’s advice, I am 100% confident that my grass will look amazing!

Thank you Renato!< /Review>

These guys are awesome!!  Renato (Southland Sod Farms Rep) came to my house to help fix my Marathon II self imposed grass issues (3 years of drought and neglect).  I originally bought the sod for my entire front yard 7 years ago.  I couldn’t believe Renato came to my house to make a plan to fix my lawn for FREE!  These guys are amazing!!</Text>

John, and everyone at Southland Farms were outstanding and enjoyable to interact with!
The level of Service and Knowledge that John provided to me and my wife was tremendous at every level esp. with all our questions after the sell.
Make sure your around to see the Antique Tractor they use to deliver your Sod Order! Our neighbors are still talking about how "Cool"-that Antique Farm Tractor was-
The Folks at Southland Farms love what they do which made for an enjoyable transaction.
Sincerely,

<time>1612625946730< /time><rating>5</rating><text>This is a follow up to my earlier post last year. As I stated, we lost our lawn and Southland Farms, Renato in particular, has walked us through every step of the way; from Spraying to roto-tilling, fertilizer and finally seeding. ( not to mention the 50 phone calls to him and he always picked up and was so gracious in answering all of my questions) Our lawn is 90% filled in and looks amazing. If it were not for Renato, our lawn would not look like it does now. Many, many, many thanks To Renato and Southland Farms! If you find yourself in our situation or you are looking to either start or replace your lawn, I would highly suggest Southland Farms and if you are lucky enough, Renato himself!</text>< Pics>

This is a very special place.
I was really touched by their tremendous effort for customer care from Renato. Everything from a phone call to delivery and instruction of how to reseed my lawn from Renato was beyond my expectation. Many respects for Renato and the company for the value that they represent.< /Review>

I sent pictures of the dead areas and he recommended that I needed two additional sprinklers which we later installed. He always responded back promptly to my texts. It was a pleasure working with him in person as well. I'm sure other customers have had the same experiences.

<review>Southland  could not have been more helpful. I wanted to put in a
for my daughter for Christmas and the president himself took the time to write Up a gift certificate signed by him, the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful, the price was unbeatable and they even tied a bow around a piece of sod to give my daughter for Christmas.

I called Southlake Farms for advice on some on some new Marathon seed I just reseeded. They connected me with Renato. He was very informative and even offered to come by and take a look at my lawn. We made an appointment for Friday between 10-11. He was prompt and friendly. He took a look at my 3 lawns and gave me excellent advise. He even noticed one of my sprinklers was not watering properly and offered to help me look at it. All it needed was turned around. Such amazing customer service. I will only use Southlake Falrs for my lawn care.<//Review>

Everytime I need sod I always use Southland Sod. Fescue blends or Tigreen the quality is always consistent and beautiful and ready to install, but never dried out. You can count on their delivery system with text times to my phone. If my clients ever have any questions or concerns John Domenici the Longtime representative at Southland has always been
there to explain or solve any concerns from a homeowner or commercial account. I buy nothing else,  because my reputation is on the line.<//text>

We bought our sod from Southland 11 months ago. Very good quality.  We called them today asking advise for some dry spots in this hot weather. John happened to be in the area and showed up in 30 minutes to see the issue by himself.  He gave us the most valuable professional advises on spot.  Awesome after sale service.  Truly appreciated.  10 stars!</text>

Amazing customer service from the lady (sorry I forgot your name Ma’am!)  that took my sod order to Art, who delivered the sod. Special thanks to Norm Lopez who provided so much technical advice and guidance. Couldn’t have done it without him!

Also shout out to Ewing Landscaping Materials in San Bernardino for all my irrigation needs and O.F. Wolfinbarger Landscaping Materials for the fine quality mulch.<//text>< user>

I was having an issue with overseeding portions of my lawn with Marathon 11 and contacted Southland Farms for assistance.  I spoke with Renato who listened to my issue and actually volunteered to come out and assess the problem. He came out the next day and provided great insights on how to best prepare the soil and apply the seed to maximize coverage.  Renato was very knowledgeable and super friendly.  My experience with Renato and Southland farms was so outstanding that I felt compelled to write this review.</Text>

<user_name>Alan Cottle</user_name><review>This is definitely the sod you want for your yard, and the company you want to provide it.  The quality of the grass is excellent, and the customer service is outstanding.

Juan was able to walk me through all of the details of caring for our new grass, including all the things I didn’t know I didn’t know.  And to top it off, they organized a complete rearrangement of the delivery/order on a moment’s notice after a mix up with our installer.  Truly a fantastic company. I’d order from them again in a heart beat- but I won’t have to because the grass is so healthy!</review>< resp>

<text>Absolutely top notch!  I ordered our sod and it was delivered to our home two days later-fresh, lush and right on time with the predicted delivery schedule. We have a new subsurface drip irrigation system and about a week later, there were some spots that were not doing well.  I called Southland Sod and was directed to Juan.  We talked a bit and he asked me to send him a couple photos of the areas in question.  He got right back to me and let me know that Norm would be contacting me.  Norm came out to our home that very day.  He examined our sod, the soil underneath and asked about the irrigation system.  It was the end of the day and he must not have had other appointments because he stayed and chatted with my husband and I for over an hour- some about sod but mostly other interests.  It really felt like we were talking with a friend.  The next morning, Juan provided us with a drip watering schedule specific to our area of the hot San Fernando Valley.  The folks at Southland Sod are very aware that in the interest of water conservation, many people are moving to drip irrigation and they bent over backwards to make sure we were successful and thrilled with our new lawn.  I do not often get to say that I felt valued as a customer and all my expectations were exceeded but Southland Sod did just that.   I highly recommend them!</text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

Today's experience with Juan Prado and Southland Sod Farms was "mind blowing"! This Dude is the genius of sod and we learned so much from him in the do's and don'ts of the care for your lawn. Even the preparation requires great details. None of these details were covered at other places where sod is sold. Also, Southland Sod Farms is the ONLY place where Marathon grass is grown. We were able to see the amazing sod fields and learn how it's grown and harvested. I would recommend Southland Sod to anyone who is serious about spending their money wisely on a top quality product for their lawn. The warranty, service, experience and engenius of this company and its' representatives like Juan is ...... actually; not a word can express. Just magnificent.</Review>

I ordered and installed 3000sq’ of Marathon 1 sod. We installed it during a couple days where the temperature was over 100 degrees. Unfortunately most of the grass turned brown within a couple of days due to the heat wave. I called Southland Sod Farms and spoke with Norm. He came out and looked at the grass and then was kind enough to order a complete replacement grass for me! Once the old grass was removed he arranged to have a new 3000’ of grass be delivered. That was very kind of them and I will definitely be ordering from them again!<//Text>

With 30+ years of knowledge, John was able to explain proper irrigation, fertilization, and mowing schedules and techniques that will help keep our lawn healthy.

<review>I had new Southland Marathon II sod laid in both front and back. The sod is a beautiful dark green and lush. After about 10 days I got a section that nutsedge weed started to sprout.  The old lawn and weeds were sprayed and killed 4 weeks before install of new sod for proper soil preparation. I wanted some information on how to handle the weeds on new sod. I called Southland sod and spoke with Laura who took my request and put me in contact with area rep John Domenici. To my surprise John  was in touch immediately and came by to personally look at the lawn. For the record. The nutsedge did not come from the sod but was most likely dormant deep in the soil brought to life by the increased watering schedule and warm conditions of that lawn section. I viewed it myself by lifting a corner of the sod and could see where the weeds were rooted.  He gave me the instructions on how to treat my sedge weed and recommended herbicide when sod is more mature in 6-8 weeks. I was extremely surprised and pleased with the rapid response I received. Also, John was able to look at the remaining part of the lawn to see how it was taking and growing with a thumbs up.  Lots of compliments on the beauty of the lawn from neighbors walking and driving by. Customer service was five stars.</review><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Although I purchased only 450 square feet of sod, Juan treated me as if I had purchased a square mile. Last year I retired from LA Building and Safety but I had no experience in lawn sod. His professional attitude and willingness to help me with the most remedial questions allowed me to ask those questions without feeling I was bothering him. I look forward to working with Southland Sod Farms. Thanks Juan.< /Text>

I bought my beautiful Maraton II sod July 2019.  When delivered, it was a beautiful jade color, still moist and professionally layed out.  Their instructions of how to take care of sod is top notch and easy to follow.   It doesn't stop there. Their employees and customer service easy to get along with and makes the experience enjoyable.   They truly care about their product and the people buying their product. I cannot stress how much I highly recommend Southland Sod Farms.<//Text>

The grass was delivered as expected but unfortunately after installing it, it died within a month. Whether it was due to our ground not being  properly prepared or us overwatering it, I really am not sure. Southland Sod Farms sent Norm out to look at it and he gave us recommendations as to what needed to be done.  We did as he recommended and then they sent out the same amount of grass as the original order.... at NO cost to us! Now this is a company that I would use again and highly recommend! Thank you Southland Sod Farms! Oh, Norm also gave us pointers how to make our existing front yard grow and look even better!  And within a week it did! Now that's customer service!

After my Marathon 2 lawn had turned yellow-ish, I called Southland for help.  They took the time to answer all of my questions and provided step-by-step instructions.  They even encouraged me to send them photos of my lawn in four weeks time.  Awesome!< /Review>

<Review>I needed  to replace the sod in my backyard after asking few contactors and my friends they all recommend  Southland Sod farm. yesterday I drove for an hour towards Oxnard from La Area and finally arrive in a very beautiful landscape area and various Sod around the building for customer to see.
once I entered the building I met  awesome friendly and professional Sarah.
she showed me different type of sod and walked outside of building with me to show me different sample of grass around the building.
she explained in detail about the sod and which one will be more ideal for my house. I ended up purchasing 500 SQ feet of Marathon II  . Sarah was very caring and arranged the delivery and all the necessary steps to help be more educated about the installation process. in fact there is a nice video in their website step by step guide for installation. I recommend to anyone to visit sod.com and see that.
over all I had great experience and I notice other employees were also very professional and helpful with other customers while I was there.
I highly recommend Southland Sod to anyone who needs their service. awesome Staff and great product.

<Review>Great customer service focused company. Every interaction was a pleasure. I had an issue with new sod installed in my front yard a few months ago. Norm and Reynaldo helped me on the phone and then they put me in contact with John Domenci that handles the sales for the area I live in. John came all the way out to my house to look at my front lawn. He ran soil tests asked me questions about watering and maintenance. He gave me a road map to having a green, healthy lawn. In addition, he looked at my bermuda back yard lawn and gave me recommendations on keeping it healthy and green. Great service, great people, great company.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Norm came to my house when I complained about brown blotchy spots on the newly planted grass from three months ago. Norm was very helpful.  He knew exactly what was wrong with the grass and immediately said that I needed to fertilize. He gave me a pamphlet with all the grass care tips on it and suggested that I buy fertilizer and fertilize right away. He explained exactly what setting to put the spreader on and to make sure I water.  Without seeing pictures Before hand , he thought perhaps I’m not watering enough but once he saw the grass he knew exactly what to do and how to fix it. He also noticed some dog urine spots and offered suggestions on how to repair those spots and gave me grass seed to do so. Norm was personable, kind, and made a connection with us right away. I would recommend his service to anyone.<//Text>< name>

I found Southland Sod Farms online last year when I moved to CA and needed to replace turf that had died due to lack of care. Their website was informative and helped me select Zeon turf. It was easy to order online. Delivery was quick and on time. I’ve laid sod many times in my life and was impressed by the quality of their product. What amazed me the most was the *personal* followup by their product mgr, Juan, who provided advice about everything from installation to maintenance! If you need sod, and especially if you’re installing it yourself, you really MUST check out Southland Sod Farms!< /text>

The people there go way out of their way to help you. My girlfriend and I weren't sure on which sod would be right for our home, and they invited us out and gave us a tour of the different varieties so we could make up our mind. That's the kind of service you just don't see any more! Great people, great experience and great service.<//review>

< Review>
We purchased $1000 in grass and it died (two weeks later). We've reached out to (Juan and Carlos) 7 times, and I was told someone was going to come to the house and look at the grass. I haven't heard back from anyone since that was 3 weeks ago.  I'm very disapponted and frustrated with lack of service and follow through. I asking for someone to call us back so we can refunded or get new sod since we were told the grass was guaranteed. Please no more run around, just help us resolve the matter.</Review>

We will also reach out to your installer to ensure that they are informed of our installation recommendations which includes proper irrigation, a step that is critical in the first 3 weeks following installation.'}< /Response>

<review>When we asked Juan about the watering schedule for our new Green Wave sod, he was extremely helpful, taking the time to ask every detail regarding our specific environment, before giving us the best schedule. Above and beyond what we expected.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1589811816877, 'text': 'Thank you soo much for your feedback.  He\'s the Juan and only:) Watering your lawn properly is one the most important things you can do to establish a healthy root system.  Too much water can "drown" the roots.  Too little watering promotes short weak roots.  Maintaining a healthy root system keeps your lawn disease free, saves water, and most importantly looking great for all your wonderful memories.'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80e84f3543ae565f:0xb19a060ad6ce41a0< /gmap_id></record>

<response>None</response><userid>113742443191949397819< /userid><review>Southland Sod Farms is an incredible company that can be relied on.  They are professional, knowledgeable, and supportive of their products from start to finish and beyond.  I have experienced maneuvering their website and speaking with their support staff in the office and sales representative all of which proved helpful.

I needed to identify the best grass to be installed by myself above a pool area.  After researching their website, I called their 800 number with some clarifying questions and my initial contact was quite helpful in addressing some of my questions.  She eventually referred me to Sales Representative, John Domenici.

John Domenici is a credit to the company and an example of somebody who goes above and beyond to assist any customer irregardless of the sale amount.  I only needed 350 sq. ft…  We had a lengthy conversation to simply determine which grass would serve best.  In this case, Zoysia Primo was the winner as it only needed to be mowed 2x-3x per year.  This was critical as it would be installed above a pool.

John proceeded to lay out a detailed plan of action for the next six months which included: (1) Prepping the soil to eliminate the weeds from October to March, (2) Ordering the sod in late March/Early April (3) Laying the sod down in April with detailed instructions on how to install and water.  I feel the need to mention that I (a 56‑year old female and 5” tall) was able to follow John’s instructions and with great success!

Since then, I have reached out to John for advice on watering, mowing, and fertilizing.  Each and every message was returned immediately with John patiently answering each of my inquiries.

And the Zoysia…?  The Zoysia Primo performed perfectly!!!!  The lack of mowing and its ability to keep out invasive weeds (thus far) has been a dream.  I firmly believe that you will receive the greatest support and quality product from Southland Sod.

I am a professional landscaper and have used this company in the past to purchase sod. This time when I called they were unable to locate my account in their system and when I asked to set up a new account they gave me the run around and were extremely rude and unprofessional. I will be using the company that I always use with no issues, Pacific Sod in the future.<//Text>

<review>I can say without a doubt that Southland Sod is the Best sod company we have ever dealt with. The order staff is cheery, the deliveries are always on-time and the sod is flawless. I only use Southland Sod for my jobs with our landscape company, Pacific Landscape Services, and all my customers at Baron Brothers Nursery. Keep up the good work!< /review>< time>

Was just cut off by one of their dangerous drivers. Then flipped off and almost run off the road. I'm a truck driver myself and I am appalled by this employees driving. How can you have people like this driving for you? Sadly this review reflects your employees driving not your product but if this is who you're sending to my house to deliver, I wouldn't want it. Please consider talking to your drivers about safety regulations. DOT would have a field day on this man's reckless driving!</text>

My husband and I are having breakfast here right now and must admit that this is the best breakfast we've had in America in 15 years. The food is 100% cooked from scratch, which is very unusual for a diner. My husband ordered a corned beef hash - it's phenomenal. They said it was slowly cooked for 6 hours. I ordered make my own omlette with mushrooms and spinach- and it's also so delicious!
The portions are large, the prices are more than reasonable, the service is very quick and polite.
Recommending this place to everyone! Bravo to the owners and the restaurant crew!</review>

We visited Sunday morning before heading back home to the Bay Area. Very friendly staff. Service was quick. Food was delicious. I had the Loco Moco and I highly reccomend. Most places make it too salty for me, but here it was just right. Husband had the biscuits and gravy and said it was good. Definitely will come again when we are in the area.< /Text>

<Text>I love this place! The food was amazing and you can't beat the prices. Most hip new places are way over priced but we loaded up on appetizers, drinks, dessert, and 2 meals for less than $50. The outdoor patio is a nice to relax with really comfortable seating and beergarten atmosphere. We absolutely love the service. Great folk and they're always on top of everything. This place is going to be our new hang out!<//Text>< user>

Being from out of town (!) we were unsure what biscuits and gravy were, so we asked and were brought a sample to try, which was really kind.  Our main meals were excellent, I had the chicken and pancakes (waffles were off) which were delicious.  The omelette my wife had was enormous, perfectly cooked and came with a good helping of sautéed potatoes.  The service was prompt, even though there were quite a few people in, and friendly.  The whole place was spotless and had great music too!  All in all a fantastic experience.  Tried to leave a review on Trip Advisor, but no listing yet.< /review>< Pics>

Question: How bold do you have to be to leave a <10% tip with your waitress watching you sign the receipt?
Answer: Not as bold as you have to be to cook and then serve your guests $13 burnt toast. And not nearly as bold as you have to be to cook and then serve your guests $13 burnt toast and call your restaurant Bread Head Kitchen.

Be warned, this establishment has no respect for bread.<//Text>

We stopped on our way back from Yosemite. There were five of us for a late lunch, and no one was disappointed with their order. Everything we tried (loco moco, falafel, omelette, fish & chips) was delicious. We usually don't get dessert at restaurants but went for it here, and were glad we did. The chocolate hazelnut cheesecake was amazing.
Service was friendly and attentive. Recommended!</review>

Although we're not open after 3pm anymore, we'd love to have you back for a breakfast or brunch date. 💗"}<//resp><review>Went for a date on a Friday night, about 7:30. Greeted by the owner, Shane~wide smile and happy to see us! Seated in corner nook, able to see the restaurant and windows, but quiet. He asked what type of wine I liked when I asked what the House suggests~he brought me a wine i hadnt had before, sweet yet earthy~
PERFECT. My apologies for not having pics or able to recall the name of the wine. Clearly my focus was on my date and enjoying the atmosphere! I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. Yummy, and enough of that and the cheese bread to take home! Date had the steak~VERY TASTY, and no leftovers to take home, unfortunatley for me! I will DEFINITELY be back! Loved that the food is really really delicious, cant describe the chicken in my fettucine! Nice, hig chunks if chicken and tender. I wont need to remember the name of the name of the wine I had, either! Shane is an expert at discerning a brand new mixology experience for you, based on what you usually like! MASTER🥂MIXOLOGIST
All food is home made, and its obvious much thought was put into the menu and choices. Ive heard the breakfast menu is insanely good as well! Will probably try that next!<//review>< date>

Decent donut place. Pros: 24 hours, plenty of parking, drive thru, and they press their breakfast sandwiches so they kind of come out tasting like a panini. There's also a little seating area outside with a table and two chairs and some tables on the inside. Cons: it's badly lit (even for a late night donut place) and there's a weird area that just looks messy and sketchy. Probably could do with some better organization and lighting to make it more costumer friendly.<//text>

Open early for your donut cravings! Love how everythings made fresh and hot they have plenty of donuts to choose from and drinks  I also like how they have drive through if your just willing to grab a quick bite and not leave the car. Also the people that work here are also the best and nicest around would definetaly recommend this place< /review>

<review>They are very friendly and help each customer. I was able 2 get my favorite ice cream flavor and good tasting dounut holes at a fair price. I was in and out in no timr. In the morning b4 work or after work they are open 24 hours to help the customers.
Keep up the good work!</review><Date>1569335192844<//Date>< rating>

Good products and service. However they don’t tell you that it’s only 24 for drive through.
But the guy doing night shift is cool and took my order anyway. 👍🏼👍🏼< /Text>

I like this location for many reasons that the donuts are a little different. A good idea for the Better donut. The staff is friendly, however some simple maintenances lacks. Can be cleaner.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>By far the worst car wash I have ever been to. I would have been better off going to a drive through at the gas station. Windows were left streaky and hazy. There were tons of spots left on my white car. I understand a few spots could slip through, but this was ridiculous! I took my car home, got soak and water, advd cleaned out myself. These weren't stuck on spots, bird poop and grease spots that wiped off easily with just a tiny bit of effort. Save your time and money and go somewhere else, anywhere else. Pictures show just a few areas of dirty solid directly after getting the car "washed".< /Review>< Pics>

<time>1541199397496< /time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>The absolute worst car wash I have been to In My Life! Admittedly I have gone here way too many times and dealt with it because it is close to where I live. But today is the last day that I will ever go here! We waited forever while the car wash line was shut down for some reason and they offered no explanation despite me asking three times. The waiting room is super hot as they have no air conditioning and the sun beams right through the windows into the seating area with no fans or any attempt to keep their clients comfortable. And the car wash, oh the car wash, it is the absolute worst! They do not care to clean your car inside or out with any sense of responsibility that a car wash should have to clean even one item well. You have to ask them to wipe areas down again and they give you a hard time about it despite the fact it's a car wash! I am not coming here anymore and I wish to God they would sell it and new owners would come in and do something better with this place because it is conveniently located for a lot of people just terrible terrible management employees!</Text>< pictures>

Im sorry, I dont like to leave a 1 star, but I needed to express my opinion and share my experience.   I wanted to get a basic car wash, which I saw went up alot in price in the past few years. $15.99 now for just a wash and vaccum. You dont even get air freshener with that one. They wrote down super wash ..$17.99 , when I clearly said express wash.  It was fine I told him Id keep the super wash since it included wheels and dash cleaning. Wheels look ok but goodness the dash and other interior still look rough. My 4 year old niece actually cleans my car better. Im dissapointed to say the least with the lack of service I received for $20.00 with tip and an additional air freshener I had to buy. Forgive the messy car in the pictures, as we just got back from camping and thought I had just gotten my car washed and cleaned. 😕< /Text>

<Text>I've been here about 4 times and each time they've done a great job but this most recent time wasn't so great. I got the works and my tires weren't cleaned and shined and the inside of my car wasn't wiped down properly. I think a new guy was doing my car though. Overall it's a good place to get your car washed and detailed!<//Text>< UserId.>

Love ! My first car buying experience was easy, quick, and done with great and careful consideration on the part of Austin Subaru. DANNY and ELDON made the whole exchange really great - those guys are the best! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! And the cold free drinks in the clean and open waiting area were a plus, too.<//Review>

I gave this place one last try but clearly it’s not getting better. With charges for large (Tahoe) cars you’d think they’d at least vacuum the back without having to be reminded. Clearly not the case. Our dash wasn’t even touched. I asked them to come back in and wipe the dirt smudge on my door. I was also informed they do not wipe down the doors handles inside. That would be a detail... this happened the last 2 times and I personally think the employees are slacking and the owners have no idea. Best of luck to them.</Text>

<user_id>112142652727510935893<//user_id><Text>There was a short wait before they got to my vehicle. The crew did a good job of vacuuming the seats as well as the floor and did the rear compartment in my SUV even though there was some stuff back there. It went through the touchless wash quickly and then the crew went to work on the quick detail (hand waxed) I ordered. Although I was promised a 45 minute turn around time, they were finished within a half hour. I examined the vehicle carefully and was pleased with the results as there were no patches of missed wax on the car and the windows were cleaner than I can ever get them to be! I was given several packets of freshener for under the seats and I left being a happy customer with my SUV looking like it was brand new!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I bring all my cars here, and only here because they care about how my cars are doing.  They are a family run business and have been doing it for 30 years!  It's all hand wash there - nothing touches the car and no machines, despite the review from Walter Macalma, don't know where he went, but it wasn't Reflectshine! :) If they missed anything, all you have to do is tell them and not be a jerk about it, and they will happily do it, they're human.  And if you don't wash and wax your car regularly, it's going to show that you don't care, not them.<//Review>

My favorite car wash...I have kids that make my car filthy.  So I take my car to Reflectshine.  I am so happy with them, because they take care of me and my family every time!!!  They are friendly, family run business and they make my car shiny and clean.  If they miss anything, I simply pointed out some little things and they take care of it right away!  Thanks Reflectshine!  see you soon!  I truly appreciate your service!!!  :)<//text>

They did a great wax protection on my new car!!!  I have a new Tesla and I want to keep it looking new. I used to bring in my old Prius and I wouldn't trust anyone else to touch my new one.  If you have any concerns about your car, bring it here - they will take care of it.<//review>

<Review>Went to have my car washed and literally have to go home and wash it again  myself. Paid for a deluxe carwash and even $2.00 extra for a SUV. The back area was not even cleaned or vacuumed. I will NEVER go back again. I wish I could post a picture of all the yellow spots that was left in the car, I could easily remove them with my finger so they were easy to remove for someone who does a good job. Sad when small businesses don't make it, but the should learn customer service and give what the customer pays for. A place I will not visit again.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc73def1f82c07:0x2b541b69ec58a861</gmap_id></record>

If I could grade with all clear stars, it still wouldn't be enough to show how selfish and absurd the owner of this so- called "business" has continuously proven to be. *This place is one to avoid* it clearly shouldn't be supported. The chaotic man (along with his sidekick female in front desk) disrespected my father and I in front of all guests and employees, and threatened to sue me for refusing to leave his property right after he held my keys away from me and refused to give them back. Please believe, it is  nightmare.< /review>

So I payed for "The Works" and the dudes did a decent job. They did miss a handful of small things that I noticed as soon as I got my car back. Smudges on the inside of the window, marks on the door panels, and bug splats on my grill. Didn't seem like it was worth whatt I payed for it.</review>

<Review>I gave this place a second try after the first time when my car still had dirt streaks all over it and the back wasn't even vacuumed out. I paid for the $115 job and again dirt streaks, conditioner lotion everywhere to the point I had to stop and get napkins because it was gross to touch anything. The two things that really pushed my buttons though: carpets are still super wet a full day later, and they put dirty rags and the oily conditioner lotion bottle IN MY BABY's CAR SEAT!</Review><Name>Amanda ward< /Name>< rating>

Service is slow and they charged me an extra $2.00 for truck/suv/van but I caught it before leaving the property. It is a family run business but they need to keep their family affairs out of the workplace. They were arguing with each other in the lobby area. Very unprofessional!! Overall there are better car wash services in the area< /Text>

Not Honest.  I took my SUV and asked for 19.99 wash plus 2 dollar cash back for tip...,  she sent me the recipte via email.  I then look at the recipt
$19.99 Wash
$5.00 for SUV Fee
$2.00 cash back.

I called her to tell her I was over changed then she said oh yah we charge an SUV fee 5 Dollars.

Never going there again,  tell your guys to let SUV clients know first before taking it upon your self to over charge. and by the way other car was around the area don't changre this fee and they do a hell of better job then you guy...  never  ever going here..  RIP OFF< /text>

Well, with all the poor reviews no wonder the owner didn't care when I told him he would get a bad review.

Came here at 11:45 pm on a Wednesday with a two year old in tow and a seven year old I had to pick up at 1:00 pm. I was told it would definitely take less than an hour for the detail. Perfect, we walked to the store and came back. An hour later. Still not done. Two year old is getting restless and I have to call to let the sitter know I'll be late for the seven year old. Two hours later... still not done. I couldn't wait any longer as the sitter had to go and the two year old was a mess. I told them to just leave it half done and asked for a partial refund. The owner would not refund anything it and kept saying it was already done. I kicked the worker out of the car, and threw my car seats and mats in the back myself. it obviously wasn't done. If you are going to take over two hours to do a job, don't promise it in less than an hour.</Review>

<review>Service is very disappointing. They broke my bug guard and didn't notify me! There was no way they didn't see it.... although they did leave soap on my car. Didn't realize this happened until I got home. Will NEVER go back. They raised their prices and charge $3 extra for an SUV on top of that. Nobody in the entire place smiles. Energy there is really bad.<//review>< rating>

Over friendly. For the price I am not impressed. I found water spots on both of my front windows, as well as the trunk. They didn't fully vacuum my front or rear interior and did not completely wipe down my dashboard.  However the car looks better than it did and they were nice. Keep in mind anytime you take your car to get cleaned by someone other than you, it may not be up to your standard.  Anywehre< /review>

I purchased there VIP wash $39.99. The ticket writer kept pushing the up sell. Asked me if I wanted my trucks utility rubber floor mates cleaned for an extra 10 bucks. Rubber floor mates REALLY?! Shouldn't that been included in the 39.99 vip wash? ...and for ten bucks! He did get me for another 10 bucks to treating all the plastic and tire treatments. But while I waited for the truck to be completed, I wandered if that should have been included in the vip package. I used to detail cars. And this step is as important as washing the car. So, when I went in to pay the cashier, even more up selling. She asked me if I wanted air scent sprayed in the truck for another 10 bucks. I declined. After paying 49 dollars for the wash, I went outside and watched this dog and pony show. The guy who dried and half ass detailed my truck had no idea what he was doing. With one rag in each hand he ran around the truck making it look like he was working really hard but in reality missing EVERYTHING! It was comedy. When he waived me over he didn't see me sitting way over to the side. He looked surprised. I started pointing every out he missed. Didn't clean the rims at all just stepped on them when he needed to reach the hood when drying. In short, didn't take his time at all washing my car. All I wanted to do at this point is just leave.
I stopped at Pep Boys just up the street from the car wash. And purchased a plastic/ rubber cleaner, shiner for 8.95 went home and detailed the truck myself.
Do not get your car washed at this place!
Buy far the worst car wash I have ever had to pay for!< /text>

Horrible, horrible job. Especially for the not cheap price, and the un-advertised $5 upcharge for a large vehicle. (Chevy Equinox, a crossover) Nothing was cleaned properly, the wheel job missed 50% of the dirt, the vacuuming was not done at all it seemed, the "free" airfreshner was a cheap 2 inch wafer handed to me, and the whole job was worse than not being done. I ended up having to go immediately to another place to get it done properly. Will NEVER use them again.<//text>

Do not go here. Paid for the basic 19.99 wash and my SUV ended up covered in hard water spots. Now I will have to buff them out. A complete waste of money.<//review>

WARNING!!! They will scratch up your entire car.
I bought a brand new car. The car had only been washed by me. I decided to start going to this place and after about 10 washes my son noticed my car was covered with little tiny scratches. I had never really looked that closely. My plastic headlights are ruined. They are scratched probably beyond repair. I talked to the manager about this and he totally blew me off and said no way they could have done it. Claimed they only use microfiber to clean cars. That's a blatant lie. Once while I was there I walked around back to see how they wash and noticed two guys each holding big wooden brushes cleaning my car. One of the employess quickly came and got me and said I couldn't be there. The brushes looked like industrial brooms that you would sweep your garage with. I figured they must be soft bristle brushes, but in hindsight it doesn't seem likely. Maybe they were ticked that I would not agree to the upsale and just wanted the basic wash, so they used brooms to clean my car. Whatever the reason they have done damage to my car and refuse to even have a reasonable conversation about it.<//Review>

{'time': 1406326030554, 'text': 'This matter has not been brought to our attention.  As we do only use microfiber and do not use wool mitts, it is the safest way to wash the vehicle.

The wool mitts are not used as they can trap unwanted dirt and debris on the flat surface and cause damage.  The microfiber bristle can not and will not, in any way, hold unwanted dirt,  and has been proven through years of use, that it will not cause damage as found in using wool mitts.  We also do not use any mechanical equipment that rotates and spins that could cause such damage.  We only use pressurized water and are 100% touch free for rinsing and drying the car, and no mechanical spinning equipment that can cause the type of damage described by Mr Patterson.\n\nThis type of damage comes from machines that spin in the direction of the vehicle and do not in any way represent our washing system as it is 100% touch free.  We have been in business for 25 years and believe we provide the safest way to wash vehicles.   We are also familiar with all the systems used to wash vehicles and are aware of the type of system that caused the type of damage described.  We do not use any mechanical rotating systems that can apply that type of force to scratch the car.  Also, keep in mind that a car can be washed in many safe ways and if the car is not  washed on a regular basis, such dirt and debris can cause scratches due to dirt that binds to the surface of the vehicle and movement of such dirt in the direction of air currents along the surface of the car.   If you should have any questions please feel free to contact us or come in to talk to the owner or manager regarding this issue.'}< /response>

Left the car wash, arrived at next stop, opened back of Fiat, found back full of grass. They don't actually vacuum the whole car, apparently.  Wish I had checked it over before I left -- or tipped.</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>This place is horrible!!!! I had been there 4 times, the first time they were a little ride and pushy, but just thought the guy was having a bad day. The second time thought I would try it again and just kind of ignored the rudeness. The third time, my truck was left filthy and was told I always complain when I come but they would give me a free wash because I was so unhappy.

The owner was shown how dirty my vehicle was after being charged $50 because it was a large vehicle. They didn't even completely vacum the inside and went through my things in the center console and glove box!!

The fourth time I took my wifes Jeep since we had a free wash ticket. I was not aware that it needed to be the exact same vehicle. As soon as I presented the ticket, the owner began to call me a crook and yelling at me for reasons that I don't understand! My wife became very upset and just as confused as I was. At this point the owner began yelling and taking pictures of me, my wife and Jeep.

I was showed off the property being yelled at that I am a crook and how can I live with my self. I had no idea that a free wash was only for the same vehicle the clearly hathe owner had mecfused with someone else.

This was my last week before I deploy, have a purple heart license plate and am just discussed how some individuals treat their customers to include military members!

They must have alot of bad days there and feel very sorry for them. I was told to never return and have no idea why but as we drove off with my wife in tears, I will never go back again!

This place should be reported and under watch for illegal employees.< /Text>< Pics>

Add me to the list of "disgruntled" customers...words of warning; if you have a bra on your vehicle, check it before you leave, especially if you have your vehicle waxed.  I too have had things missing (can't prove it) from my SUV that were there "before" I had my vehicle was washed there.  Somebody please invent a negative star!< /Text>

<Text>I went to Reflectshine Auto Wash in Oceanside, California on Monday, June 20, 2016 at 8:45 a.m.  Upon pulling my car up to the covered vacuuming area, a Hispanic worker wearing a radio headset, came up to me asking what I would like to have done.  I elected the $18.99 car plan which included additional service such as polish and tire care.  I mentioned that the chrome wheels on my Jaguar would require a little more attention when using the water pressure wand.  He then proceeds to try selling me another $40.00 wheel care plan.  I told him my wheels weren't that dirty to pay that and if the worker focused a little more with the wand, it should be fine.  I then sat down and watched them quickly and roughly vacuum the floor and seats with the same worn plastic nozzle.  I went over and asked them to be more careful on the leather seats to avoid scratching them.  Soon thereafter, it was brought to the front of the car wash entrance for preparation.  The earlier worker I had asked to let the preparation worker know about my wheels was never told what I had asked. The guy sprayed the entire car quickly without any focus on the wheels, took a wood-handled brush and quickly and not thoroughly went over the car.  He even started the conveyor belt to pull the car through prematurely.  He unsuccessfully rushed trying to do he other side as it was dragged away.  While in the inside waiting room, I approached an older female cashier and  asked to speak to the manager about this.  She told me it was her son and would let him know.  I then spoke to him.  He is dark haired, Persian or Hispanic, and in his 40's.  He was VERY rude, condescending and hard to understand due to his heavy accent.  He wasn't open to any of my concerns.  HE WAS A MAJOR JERK!!!   As I continued to wait, I had a "gut" feeling that this establishment probably has had many complaints in the past.  So, I looked them up on Yelp and Google.  On Yelp, there were 85 reviews and a total of 1.5  (out of 5) Star Rating.  Upon reading the complaints, the majority of them were VERY negative.  I then went over to the cashier and told her what I just learned.  She admitted that they were aware of all the negative Yelp reviews.  About that time, I was told my car was ready.  Upon inspecting it, I found that there were many dirt spots remaining on the vehicle, carpet wasn't cleaned well, and my electric front seat had been pulled as far forward as possible and wasn't working anymore.  I expressed my dissatisfaction, didn't tip the worker and left for home in "cramped" quarters.  THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLELY UNPROFESSIONAL AND TRULY PROVIDES POOR WORKMANSHIP!  Not worth the money spent!  I will never go there again and do not recommend this place at all!!!< /Text>< username>

My husband and I had a concern for our new water heater and the water that was being dispensed outside our home. Josh was very receptive to coming back to address the issue. He was thorough with his assessment and made some minor adjustments to our problem. I'm glad to know that we won't need to stress about upsetting our neighbors anymore.<//review>

<Text>Kevin did a great got scheduling and keeping me updated on when the technician would be coming by. I like that they send a picture of the tech with the updates. Rick is a licensed technician who really knows his Noritz tankless water heaters, which is what I was having issues with. He did a good job explaining the issue and what I could do better in maintaining. My only issue was with the price, which I thought was high for using an old part that was going to be recycled in the repair. I would use Monkey Wrench for their expertise in tankless water heaters but I would not use them for general maintenance because I don’t think I can afford them for most things.< /Text><rating>3< /rating><gmapID>0x80c2a5a2a063215d:0x355c3ad00cb8fd80< /gmapID>< date>

<text>During a bathroom remodel my tankless water heater went out and I called a few places for a quote. Monkey Wrench Plumbing was very responsive and was able to schedule a visit for an estimate right away. They called to confirm the appointment and even let me know when the plumber was on his way! That was great.

When Josh arrived he took a look at my current tankless and have me a few options and suggestions. The different quotes were promptly sent to my email for me and my family to review.

Although I went with a different company I will say that MWP was very professional, courteous and prompt. Definitely a breath of fresh air from my other plumbing experiences.</text><Rate>4< /Rate>< time>

<user>107222827951080042232< /user><text>Josh and Isidro are true professionals. We needed hot water because my tankless water heater kept breaking down. Josh came out, assessed the situation, and gave me many options as to how I could fix the problem. I completely switched out my system with a brand new one. During the time they worked, they were very patient with my curious 5 year old son and answered all his questions. I was given a run down of how everything was set up and how everything works. These guys are not only friendly, but extremely knowledgeable and thorough.  I’m completely satisfied with the quality of their work and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this company.

These guys are great - all of them.  We had Ruben first, a year ago he replaced our tankless water heater and some other stuff and did a great job.  We were most satisfied.  Today we had Max for our one year service appointment and he was great, really knowledgeable, very helpful and just really enjoyable.  Then we had a Joshua for our other tankless water heater.  Today we had Rick Aguirre for installation of a soft water system.  It was a big job and he did a great job.  He went over and above.  Some lines had a way to go and he trenches them.  He was personable, professional and he obviously knew what he was doing.<//Text>

I needed help with the "last mile" of my Tankless
Lauren took my call and routed my request to Joey in dispatch.
I was given a window of time and a phone call to say technician Josh is on his way.
In less time than it took for my wife to say "John when are we going to hot water again" Josh had diagnosed my Tankless issue and resolved the problem. Me 15 years as an union electrician, another 15 years as a field superintendent for large commercial general contractor and finally my last stop hopefully, a facilities manager at a University. Lets just say I have been around, working on, installing systems most of my adult life. Monkey Wrench will now be a part of my proverbial tool box.</Text>< rating>

<text>Airport Little League is an Urban Initiative  League that has been working hard to become one of The Best League around the South Sacramento Area. Its President Henry Hernandez, VP Gus Jauregui, The Heart of The League(because she wears a lot of hats) Mrs. Joanne Jauregui, and the rest of the Board Members, Along with the Managers, Coaches, and Parents, All make this league feel like one Big Family. I highly recommend signing your child up here and joining in on all the Baseball Little League Fun and Memories that you will cherish for a lifetime. I played for this Little League back in 1984-1989, and I now have 2 of my own sons that have been with the League for past 3, working on 4 seasons.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc5QJrzLXffijwvrjuXfyHAFO_-ieJVDXDSrpL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPmonqgcwUvqQkWvsME9rQRo2D1wqaTUIS34PP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEuziztAU9Muogg_r8zxlCLUYnKIfQjZvw1ElR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7sZpnhTXy5I50xMi_40JlJ6zOWDOlycD8xedz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn1a4ffnJGelZw80OarWgWGY_SuE6C48v0qeUr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOji0TgB6QIWFj-4ffro-kFbOWdRMsq3aVtpo2m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZmFTNdy4J_S9DuRcyEmoLJQ2_5GCzCwN4svMg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEjLSIqIg9oGCnyjM97la2i5bJLXybWP26484s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-8ktfZC6ZoOqV37qP7w-vjBh9rV1gqWCSVG7y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy0Mo034tnA2lKpTFKjG1cILrkgS_HQj-eFhUe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyERg2EWRvg0TGfXl_mohkuXxOTDDKkmVnpsco=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6aGCUVGMo5g-h8P8ZMKJYRk0EzRVCEjXO49ea=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvwOQkkKaX9pOGKFOzhZpqeoZFjlJMIHvfrMSD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVhRr_iZwefjMqsQeUjwjsbWkuiUhK_27qKwAq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHAyyA1Hg9MOd73l5LIqVAwryuv0R1g-klQ07Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrHrBTMfVI-RBXwXAGEd0EFsWIi7IFDJsjRecr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIk9smZEJJCSDYvYs3UGcAvR5nDPWjdkHVcuta=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIfpFCpiSsSvNLgM92ujEQlfTfYs1hVQ7dtM_6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP2egvMaP8whUQBvBE1FDdD9uXlIO1QYfjdfUS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXcr9Qx_7xB4c6x1P-1phV_R-PhHwwykeXgI0j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Nice park with two little league fields and a snack area.  Fun to see the planes land on the nearby runway as the game is underway.  Parking seems easier here than other fields.  Only drawback is that there isn't much shade for players or spectators, so wear your sunscreen!< /review><user_name>Christian Griffith< /user_name><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rating>

I was charged an extra $40 because they said my vehicle takes 8qts of oil. I never heard of any car taking 8qts of oil. That price should have been discussed before the work was done, since it wasn't discussed makes me feel it was to intentionally ripp me off.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Highly recommend this place. Richard helped me with a price I could afford. As well as the guys in the garage. Had my battery charged when I got there and made sure tires had air.... The lady in the office was awesome as well.  Thanks Darlene Wilson.. I will recommend friends and family... Honest people</Text>

Very helpful and let you take your time to pick out your tires even if you make a mistake and put brand new on the back when you should have put it on the front and you come back and say I made a mistake the back should be on the front LOL and they did the job again for me for free<//review>

<rate>5</rate><review>George was super helpful as always. It was my first time going to the San Bernardino location vs Redlands and the reception/office area was clean, nice and accommodating with WiFi etc.

But most of all, I have a Volvo and I won’t go anywhere else with my car now (other than a dealer). These guys are really great and always get the job done right at very reasonable rates. Highly recommend.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Brought my car in and they were kind enough to give me a ride all the way down town so I could get back to work.….when they were done they came back and picked me up. Did great work on my car. needed engine work…runs excellent. I priced out the work at several shops before bringing the car in and Anies was the best deal. very friendly highly recommend them.</review>

Was stuck with an emergency as my vehicle was seriously overheating, After looking it over Angie explained it was most likely a clogged thermostat, that he could fix it but it would be much cheaper to do it myself and a relative easy fix.  Told me exactly what to do, and never charged me anything.  I went to the auto parts store got the part for $8 and fixed it myself in 30mins.  If Angie was such a "scammer" I don't think he would have helped me not making a dime in the process.<//text>

The food was good and our waiter was very good, I gave 4 stars cause that's a little high price for breakfast, hashbrowns 5. And I thought the berry sauce came with it. I may try dinner one day. It would be nice to offer veterans or a senior menu. Will try lunch one day</Text>

Came here because it was near my hotel.  Food was good but it's way over priced, even for SoCal. $25 for 2 pancakes, sausage, scrambled eggs and hash browns.  Took so long to get my check, I stood by my table holding my wallet then gave up &  walked to the front.  Fortunately, I got there early enough to not have to wait because if I had, then this would be a 1 star review.</Text>

Beloved diner in the neighborhood of Burbank. It has a special place in our hearts because this is where we had the last meal with great-grandpa before he passed away.</Review>

They are sitting for outdoor dinning. Yum. Food so good when it is fresh and not take out. Love that the staff has worked there for a long time and are so friendly. Support your  local restaurants during these hard times for all.< /text>

Wow!!! Delicious!! I didn't know about this restaurant until tonight when Burbank Band did a dine out. So safe! So fast! So fresh. All Through the pandemic my take out fried any have been a disappointment. But these onion rings!!! Omg so good and crisp not greasy. They're perfect. And my BbQ chicken salad exceeded my expectations.<//Text>

They have a great $5 cocktail special, which while they arent world changing, they are affordable which is hard to find here.  The food was absolutely delicious and the service was good and friendly, though not as on top of my endless cup of coffee as I would have hoped.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFEhxy1Yo2Mt5pehb2w67YYSzndZtOY_BnigdR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU526Ld_HP6sCwTn4U535LoKjf8RVWzbdqqxAC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6HnKaZ6sd-g9TMDFGIVpTTUQ6bq-J5Al_4E5A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>First time t rr ying this place, it was a disappointment, I ordered the half soup and half sandwich combo..  i had ordered the grilled ham and cheese and it was just awful, the ham was thrown on the grill and was dry, it was placed between two slices of bread along with a slice of Swiss cheese on bread that was grilled bare, totally dry and taste-less.  It could have used some condiments (mayo? Mustard) to dress it up.  It was a really cold night (57°) and they were not prepared and had no heaters.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I usually order breakfast when I come here. It's always good. Unfortunately, the other day our order seemed to be taking quite a while to arrive. The server came to our table probably 30 minutes after we placed our order to say that his tablet's battery didn't have enough power to send our order to the kitchen, so it was lost. He was very apologetic, took our order again, on a notepad, and our food came out just a few minutes later. I like the idea of using new technology to expedite ordering, but make sure the tablets' batteries are sufficiently charged. Our server said it had happened a few days earlier for a party of 20. The order went in fine, but when it came time to give them the check, they decided they wanted separate checks. When he tried to do that for them, the entire order was lost and he had to try to remember everyone's order again. As I said, he was very apologetic. I'm just glad we weren't in a hurry to be somewhere after breakfast. I hope he doesn't get reprimanded for telling us about the tablet snafu. He was just being very polite and wanted us to know why our order had taken so long.<//text>

They are definitely making improvements to the place with the introduction of tablets and a somewhat recent refresh to the interior. They also offer to-go order services like grub-hub etc. The staff is also very friendly and welcoming.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>My brother in law had a serious craving for biscuits and gravy last weekend after we finished our round of golf.  We got lucky and happened across the Hill Street Cafe in Burbank.  The food was first class and so was the service and the interior.  We will definitely be back soon 😊< /text><date>1577144097349<//date><userid>115874415549624083874</userid>< Name>

< Review>
Overall the prices were decent. And the food was decent. Me and my wife both got burgers. I was shocked to see that they provide grass feed beef patties for their burgers.l as well as the impossible meat burgers for the vegans out there. It looks like its becoming a trend now, which is great. The burger it self was pretty good. Only thing is is that I wished it was charbroiled and not cooked on a griddle. I got a side of onion rings and the wife got fries. Onion rings were much better then the fries.< /Review>

<text>When I first saw the retirement home behind the restaurant, I thought the food would be bland and the atmosphere would be boring. But to my pleasant surprise the food was bland BUT the salad was amazing. The atmosphere is pretty chill and they like to play Smashing Pumpkins as I sadly eat alone and stare out the window as I reflect on my life's misfortunes and mistakes. Luckily for me, choosing Hill Street was not one of them.

The weekend breakfast specials are fantastic and I admittedly love the chorizo breakfast quesadilla. It's delicious and greasy enough to kill the hangover I have from Friday night after drinking enough Long Island Iced Teas to repress the memories of my father. Never did get those smokes, huh pa?

Customer service is always amazing as well and nobody judges me for silently weeping.

10/10 would have continued to eat here had I not moved up north to find myself.< /text>< user_name>

A great grilled chicken sandwich. Very large piece of chicken, fresh toppings, and crispy fries. It was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting the food to be rather poor. If you’re in Burbank for any reason, give the grilled chicken sandwich a try, you’ll thoroughly enjoy it.<//text>

<review>I was in the Burbank area for a meeting and I saw this place on the corner and  I was hungry so took a chance on it.  The greeting from the server was so freindly and genuine.  The place was noticeably clean and very well kept for a breakfast/lunch diner.  The menu was generous in selections and my choice of chicken breast with mozzarella and pesto on Ciabatta bread was slam dunk awesome!
I'm from NY and super picky but this place gets 5 BIG STARS!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Always enjoy lunch in this classic feel coffee shop/diner. Burgers are good, salads are fresh, daily soup is on a rotating schedule and, though I've never gotten it, always gets compliments from those I'm dining with. They've got an extensive breakfast menu, too, if you'd like to satisfy that pancake craving. For lunch, I get the Basil Chicken Pesto sandwich quite often as it is a favorite - fresh grilled chicken breast, melty delicious mozzarella cheese, and a flavorful basil pesto spread all on fresh toasted ciabatta. Maybe not weak-in-the-knees good, but a very good and filling lunch. Service is always consistent and prompt, though a smile with it is hit or miss. Kids eat free all day on Tuesdays. Stop in for a nice breakfast or lunch. It's always enjoyable.<//Text><UserId.>111704022336765020634<//UserId.><user_name>Eric Overholt<//user_name>< GmapID>

I got in there and everything was great up until I saw one of the servers coming towards my table. What i saw was this open sore on his lips. Now whether it was herpes or a cold sore I don’t know... I don’t take any chances so without touching anything I just left. This is a warning, so just a heads up for y’all who want to go here for the first time or again.</Review>

<review>This place is no run of the mill restaurant  they are top flight service and the food is cooked by a real" Chef " a Gourmet  Chef.  like Chef Ramsey, they are not expensive they should be. Packed everytime I've eaten in this establishment. I think the building is a old Bob's big boy or something along that line ..go you will not be disappointed.</review><UserId.>105092469004403817697<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

<review>This place is no run of the mill restaurant  they are top flight service and the food is cooked by a real" Chef " a Gourmet  Chef.  like Chef Ramsey, they are not expensive they should be. Packed everytime I've eaten in this establishment. I think the building is a old Bob's big boy or something along that line ..go you will not be disappointed.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
Small local place.  Looks like it was a Dennys or Coccos in the past.  They deliver or you can order for pick up.  Typical dinner food...Sandwiches, Wraps, Meat Loaf, and Burgers.

Everything is average.  Never had anything I didnt like, never had anything I was looking forward to having again.  Staff is polite but not exceptional.

They serve Pepsi Products.</Review>

<resp>{'time': 1514416628446, 'text': "Hi Ruth, I'm sorry that you had such a bad experience here today, please accept my sincere apologies. When you were here, there were a lot of regulars and our staff was just going around and wishing them a happy holiday season and asking about their Christmas. Danny should have been more attentive to you and your friend and children, and it was not his intention to appear disrespectful, as he is Hispanic and there would be no need for him to be hostile towards you guys. Also, one of the servers had his kids come in so they can get a present from another employee. We pride ourselves here on more than 60% of our customers visit our restaurant multiple times a week and over the 15 years we've been here, we have developed relationships and friendships and especially during this holiday season, they were just saying their hellos around. With regards to your food, the kitchen made a mistake and put bacon on the first club sandwich, so the server asked them to make you another one with no bacon, that was the only delay and the server should have relayed that message. Again, accept my sincere apology and we wish you the best for the New Year!"}</resp><user_id>109789447606987671131<//user_id>< Review>
Racist! The only reason why we stayed was because of the older gentleman that received us at the front. They took forever to take our order and they served all of their regulars, friends and family oh and the white people with money. Everything took extremely long. Except for getting a table again because the older gentleman helped us out. The only reason I️ left a dollar was for the person clearing the table. The only thing that arrived immediately was the check.<//Review>

<text>As a "road warrior" I was very happy to find a restaurant that was a 2 minute walk from the hotel.  For an added bonus there is a banner out front screaming about the Best of LA 2009.  So I walked down for dinner not once but three times and I am confused.  The food is marginal at best and I don't have high expectations yet the place was packed each time. Additionally the service, in each instance, was abysmal. My confusion stems from why this place gets the patronage it does. I would expect a market the size of LA to create more discerning diners. The next time I want a below average dining experience I will drive to Denny's instead of walking 2 minutes to the Hill Street Cafe.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c295018999d533:0xbbac84441aab60a</gmap_id><userid>115040699995844473206<//userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

The atmosphere a tad lackluster. We waited a little bit at the door before finally being offered a table. The food really does make up for it. Fries are a crispy and crunchy hybrud, and their burgers and sandwiches are surpreme. Also, I believe there is a 15% discount if you eat between 3 and 5pm. Overall, it's a fairly good resteruant if you don't mind tile tables.</Text>

The most disgusting experience you can ever have at this restaurant I found a small sizes cockroach in my soup it was the most terrifying feeling ever i still get chills when i think about it .. I of course confronted the manager and he rudely accused me of placing it in the food.. Terrible management i will be filing a complaint......</Review>

Sometimes the service isn't the greatest, but they have some of the best burgers and shakes ever. I live close by, and it's dangerous having this place available because I could eat here every day! Great prices, big portions, and an old school cafe atmosphere.</text>
