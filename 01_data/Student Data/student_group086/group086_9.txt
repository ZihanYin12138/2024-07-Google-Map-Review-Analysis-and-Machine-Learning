I get the pleasure of seeing Michael every Tuesday and it has been wonderful. In these difficult times you look forward to certain people that make your day and Michael does that. Very friendly when he walks in, makes the customers feel comfortable knowing that he is cleaning the bathroom and refilling those sanitizing station. I’m very please with the service I receive from Enviro-Master and that they send over Micheal.<//text>

I like this company, and the service they provide is Paramount in these challenging times. Not everyone takes a conscience on the clean bathrooms manner, and it’s essential to deter COVID-19 from spreading so we would get out of the situation soon and safer.< /review>

To start, I have to say, the service was phenomenal. The waitress (also owner) was so wonderful to chat with. The atmosphere was amazing and led to a wonderful dinner with my even more gorgeous wife. The food started off wonderful.

After the appetizers, we had the most wonderful meals including the veal (yes its light and the portion is less, but with how good the flavor is and the price of veal it's well worth it!)  We also had fettuccine carbonara which outshines any restaurant nearby. If you're deciding between this place and any other nearby, this place would take it for me anytime!< /text>

Great pizza and VERY generous toppings.  Slices are so big they are hard to pick up.  Definitely need to use a fork and knife if you don't want your toppings falling all over the place.  Not shoot on the cheese either.  I'll be back!</text>

<Review>Classic Italian fare. The lobster ravioli is unbelievably good and worth every penny. With that being said, the veal was good but almost non existent. Two and a half of very thin slices, a half? Not worth the high price. The bolognese was good but could’ve used a bit more meat.</Review><Time>1589440352121< /Time>< pictures>

Oh my God, this place was absolutely amazing!
The lobster ravioli was cooked to perfection.  The eggplant was delicious, but the scampi with prawns and scallops were top of the line!  If you are in San Francisco, you have to try the this place.<//Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>Man.  I really don't like deep dish pizza.  So what am I supposed to do?  Give them a bad rating?  Nah.  I think they make fine deep dish pizza.  I just don't like it.  Too tomato-y.  Too saucy.  I don't really know what to say anymore.
Edit: Owner responded graciously.  5 stars.  It's good deep dish, I just don't like deep dish.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085808de181fbb3:0x3b273ce2003bcbd< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food was delicious and servings are generous without being over the top. Service was on point. Location spot on. Beer and wine list is good too. Really good way to start a few days in San Francisco.</text>

<Text>Visiting SF for the first time and we came here for our first night out. Felt very comfy and quaint. All of the staff were nice and attentive. However, when we were nearing the end of our visit, they weren’t very accommodating to our split payment needs. We are traveling as a group friends for spring break but they didn’t seem to understand that we needed to pay separately. Felt rushed & they were slightly rude but the food was good! Slightly overpriced as well.< /Text><UserId.>107327997988772046741< /UserId.></record>

Very attentive staff and service was good. Price was reasonable, however, food was average - the bruschetta was served with hot cooked tomatoes, which makes it non-authentic! Some of the shell  seafoods (mussels and pipis) in the Risotto were cold, the entire dish was as if it was just mixed together and heated up in the microwave.< /Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>I'll start by saying that the pasta was delicious.
The service was fantastic. The lighting was nice. It was wheelchair accessible.

The only thing I will say is that the bruchetta didn't have enough basil and it should never be heated or warm tomato on it. It also had too much  cheese on top.
The free bread comes with oil and balsamic... though there was not enough vinegar i could barely taste.

I will not be back. However im Italian so im picky with these things. It was nice otherwise.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Loved this restaurant. Our first time trying it out. At first we thought it was not impressive because of the way it looks. We came in ordered food, and when it came out it was delicious!!! Nice atmosphere- we talked to a couple sitting next to us. They were from Germany on tour in the US. Overall, it was a very nice experience and for sure we will come again when we are in the vicinity. (The only downside to our outing was that we stayed at the Huntington Hotel. It's a trek downhill and a trek UPHILL when you are full and a bit tipsy :) )<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x8085808de181fbb3:0x3b273ce2003bcbd< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Came in as a single diner and was treated like a vip!   The wait staff is personable and attentive without hovering, and this place is quiet enough to enjoy an intimate conversation!  The food was great, with a delicious savory leaning, no overwhelming spices but very fresh ingredients!  The fettuccini alone is worth the trip:. Chewy, tender and see-through thin!!  The Alfredo sauce was rich and delicious without even a hint of goopiness or heaviness!</Text>< Pictures>

Dinner was disappointing. Was expecting a lot better. They got 1 extra star for presentation, quantity and service. Had 2 dishes neither custom both fish shellfish based. On further thought never did find the fish in that one dish nor flavor for that matter. Once we see canned mushrooms you can expect the quality to go down hill quickly.  Not a place I plan on going back to. Shoulda gone with the sushi place up the block.<//review>

<Review>This homely restaurant has delicious Italian food as if it's a restaurant in Rome. There is usual a dinner rush, so it is wise to make a reservation. The service is excellent, and the waiters and waitresses are very accommodating. One important thing of note is to avoid the first table at the front of the restaurant. It is right next to the oven, and gets unbearably hot. Other than that, this is a wonderful restaurant to get away from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco.<//Review>< pics>

The bread served at the beginning was fresh and warm, and the rest of the food followed, everything was delicious and the homestyle serving of the vegetables gave a nice mix. Prompt service and attentiveness to a solo diner, and reasonable prices.<//Review>

<review>This is a nice and friendly little Italian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. Food is good, you can get several traditional Italian dishes, and the service is also very friendly. Prices are not very expensive for downtown San Francisco. This is also not a boring chain restaurant...</review>< pics>

Lovely smiley waitress, but poor quality of food. I had a Caesar salad, which consisted on lots of salad leaves, 3 olives, a quarter of a tomato and a tablespoon of croutons.< /review>

Very noisy restaurant. Bruscheitta was lovely but bolognese was bland. My partner loved her Carbonara. I tried the bacon in this and it was very nicely cooked. An ok meal.< /Review>

<Review>Nice little Italian place on the south slope of Nob Hill. All the food was good, not great. Menu is extensive and features standard Italian fare. We had the Lasagne (OK), Linguine Carbonera (Very good), Gnocci (Very good). It's a great place for a date night as well.</Review>< Pics>

This is probably one of the finest Italian restaurants we have been so far. We went there for a dinner and had a great time, of course at the cost of a big hole in our pocket.

Food:
We had Bruschetta, Ravioli Di Spinachi, a classic Tiramisu and the Dessert of the day (Cannoli) and none of them disappointed. Bruschetta were good - nothing too facy or overdone but just right. Ravioli Di Spinachi was amazing. Filling was good and the parmesan sauce was brilliant. What blew away our mind was Tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. It is a must try and a disappointment if you're planning Italian desserts and not ordering Tiramisu. Cannoli was good but not so much that it goes into the list of Dessert of the Day.
Overall, the food was quite above the benchmark but it is quite heavily priced too, so be ready to sign a big check at the end.

Ambiance:
The place is a little dark. Perhaps a little more bright light will give it a better feeling. Not much cramped and very comfortable seating - more like restaurants which are meant for fine dining. Given that we went on a weekday night, it wasn't much crowded.

Service:
The service was good and quick. The food took reasonable time to come. But if you're in a rush, this restaurant is not for you. The staff is good overall - no bad experience as such.

Overall, if you're in San Francisco, this restaurant is a must try if you want to taste some real good Italian.< /review>

< review>
We are visiting the city as a family for the first time sense 1981. My mom & I had not been here sense. My sister had been here for work a few times and my youngest niece was just thru here a couple of weeks ago on a college tour. We gad a very long day driving up from San Diego and asked our concierge for a casual pasta Italian place close by. He recomended this wonderful gem. Food was very good, service nice and accommodating. I got the putenessca (so not how you spell it I'm sure.) Mom the cabonera, and sister & niece the spinach ravioli.  All were very pleased with their choices. Woukd defiantly recomend.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The decor is not the highlight of this restaurant but it is better a deco average but good food. And that's the case, very nice surprise. We did not expect to eat as well in an Italian restaurant run by Asian people ;-)

(Original)
La décoration n'est pas le point fort de ce restaurant mais il vaut mieux une déco moyenne mais de bons plats. Et c'est le cas, très belle surprise. Nous ne nous attendions pas à manger aussi bien dans un restaurant italien tenu par des asiatiques  ;-)</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Food very good, unfortunately no Italians. By good wine selection and friendly service no deduction.

<review>Good for a quick, half hearted soap up and rinse. The change machine gives you tokens to use (not actual $1 us currency) so you have to use them here only. The wash options do have a tire cleaner (which is cool) but doesn't have a spot free rinse, which I feel is necessary to give more stars. If the time frames were a bit more generous and they gave/took $1 usd coins, they might be worth 5 stars.</review><userid>111713983498800686358< /userid>< GmapID>

< review>
One of the best car washes in town only thing is I would have gave it five stars if it were not for no available staff and no soap and no wax or soapcame out of the pressure and I spent $12 today. Also try to contact the phone number to the play some business and only got a busy signal each time I called.< /review>

It needs a "spot free rinse" option. My car had water spots all over afterwards.</Text>

(Translated by Google) This place is more or less not so bad, I liked the water pressure, because then it removes the stains if the car is very dirty with dirt.

Blessings 3D/4D Ultrasound studio was an absolutely BEAUTIFUL, PRICELESS experience! We booked the appointment for our son & his girlfriend quickly (only a day and a half prior.) From the moment we walked in, we felt so comfortable. Rebecca and Esmeralda were amazing...so compassionate, so kind, so patient, so welcoming with their genuine smiles & heartfelt happiness for all of us, especially as we marveled at this most beautiful BLESSING God created. The atmosphere was unbelievable. A Beautiful large room with Large comfortable couches, dimmed lighting, sweet soft relaxing baby music in the background, all for the mommy & daddy to be (and the family) to enjoy this special moment. Through all of our tears of joy, laughter, excitement, I can’t say enough about Rebecca and Esmeralda. They truly care about their clients & definitely make sure it’s a one of a kind experience. They took great, clear pictures & were so wonderful with telling us at the end of the appointment, exactly when to close our eyes, as to not reveal the gender. Watching our son & his girlfriend walk out, with their teddy bear that has their baby’s heartbeat in it, was a magical moment. Blessings is an absolute blessing🙏🏻< /text>

The ladies who helped us first visit and Rebecca second visit did a wonderful job and were very sweet. They made me feel extremely welcomed. Rebecca did extremely great capturing my little ones 3D 4D pictures. Baby was giving us a little hard time, but towards the end got really good pictures!! Thank you Rebecca!

<review>Usually never review anything but why not. I just had my 3D/4D Ultrasound here and I’m beyond happy!! The price says $60 but they have a special right now for $55, I got 4 color pictures and a cd with all 67 pictures. The Ultrasound Tech was so sweet, my baby’s face was pushed up against the placenta when we began and she didn’t give up on trying to move him or waiting for him to move, I appreciate the patience! Definitely recommend coming here and inviting family members they have a big theatre room!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>I went for a 3D/4d during the week, and my baby was not very cooperative with positioning. She had her feet and arms in the face the whole time and moving around. My technician Ellianna was amazing. She was so patient in trying to get images, allowed me to change positions to try and get the best photos. The room is very clean and printed images and DVD are great quality.</Review><user_name>Haleh Carrera</user_name><rating>5< /rating>< user>

I have been to blessings 3D/4D two times now. The first time was 2 years ago to find out the gender of my daughter & again today to see my baby boy in 3D. Both experiences were great. Today Eliana was very patient, my baby boy didn’t want to cooperate, & she was very nice about it & kept trying. We were able to see part of his face, & I’m really happy that she was patient with us. I will definitely recommend to friends & family.<//Review>

I don’t live in the area so I googled and searched for a location to do a 4D ultrasound and found Blessings! They were GREAT! The technician took her time to look at each baby (since I’m having twins) and she explained all the images. The couch is spacious and comfortable, the screen in HUGE, and it was a great experience.<//Review>

This place is amazing. Loved my first time experience especially because the chick that helped me out was very sweet and helpful. She was able to tell the babys gender even when he was being difficult. Overall, I’m definitely coming back..</Text>

I love this place. The technicians are very sweet and the experience was amazing!! The lobby is very cute and the room is very cozy! There is a big sectional couch for family and friends and a large screen to view the baby, for everyone. I brought my best friend and daughter along, my daughter and I didn't want to find out the gender today. My best friend now knows the gender and they were very professional. They took some amazing pictures and made a video to very sweet lullabies. I will definitely recommend this place to others and plan on coming back for my 3D/4D ultrasound. 5 stars in my book.<//review>

This is my 3rd baby and the technician Yesenia was very great at trying to get the best images. She was gentle and very good about explaining things to me. The place is neat and clean and has a very welcoming environment. Their prices are reasonable as compared to other places I’ve been. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

I had THE BEST experience at Blessings Ultrasound Studio! Their prices are very reasonable for great quality. Yesenia was friendly and professional. My baby girl wasn’t as cooperative as I had hoped but Yesenia was patient and kept working with my baby to get the best images possible. I will definitely be coming back. I brought my whole family and Yesenia was so nice she felt like part of our family. I will definitely be recommending this place to anyone looking for a great, clean, comfortable place to make memories with loved ones.< /review>

I had such an amazing experience here. I have gone four times now, twice for each pregnancy and they are so sweet and take there time when getting the baby to move into the right position. I currently just had Yesenia, and Laura do a 3D 4D for my current pregnancy and to say the least my daughter wasn’t moving into the right position but these ladies worked there magic to get some cute side profile pictures. They were seriously amazing and I highly recommend anyone to go. Thanks again girls!<//Review>

Totally loved this place. My 3rd pregnancy, and I had the best well detailed ultrasound I've  had. Margarita was so understanding and helpful with my concerns, good customer service from a call center.
Yesenia a true caring profdesional! She gave me piece of mind as she performed my ultrasound. My kids loved it too, watching movies and comfy couch. Clean and very organized. This studio is a blessing!
Yesenia even saved me $2, which I will start a piggy bank for my baby💝.</Text>

<Review>We had an appointment for a 4D ultrasound, it was such a wonderful experience. I’m only 26 weeks so baby is still pretty skinny, I would recommend doing it around 30 weeks (baby will be a lot fuller). My husband and I traveled from out of town & we wanted to surprise my mother-in-law with an opportunity to see her first grand baby. This place was PERFECT, it was clean, & affordably priced. Yesenia our technician took her time & got the best images of our little baby girl. Thank you for making it such a special moment for our family.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1556121701528, 'text': 'Hello Veronica,\nThank you for entrusting Blessings with your memorable moment.

<Review>My husband and I just had our first ultrasound for our first child! At 8 weeks they were able to get great images and let us hear the heartbeat, truly amazing! Yesenia was so great, as she was doing the ultrasound she would explain exactly what she was doing and what we were looking at. It was such a comfortable environment. Margarita was also great by helping us make the appointments and with choosing the best package for what we wanted. It really was a great experience and we’ll be coming back in a few more weeks to check on the little fellas progress!</Review>< response>

I took my sister here to discover the gender of her baby and it was a wonderful experience! The rooms are big enough for the whole family the experience is incomparable. Also we couldn't see the gender right away due to the baby crossing her legs but they were so patient they let us hang around and squeezed us back in between other patients.</Text>

< Review>
We were thoroughly impressed from our call to schedule our gender scan until the end of our visit. This place was amazing, everyone was so knowledgeable, friendly and truly went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. We were fortunate enough to have had Yesenia as our ultrasound technician, she had her work cut out for her as our stubborn little nugget was comfortable and not wanting to be cooperative. Not only was the umbilical cord nestled between baby’s legs but my Placentia was hanging low right where our nugget was happily hiding. She suggested different tricks and thankfully they worked . Definitely recommend getting your scan here it’s such a great atmosphere and the staff amazing.</Review>

This place is a hidden gem in the AV. The 3D/4D imaging we received was reasonably priced. We were also able to schedule an appointment the very next day. They have teddy bears for sale, as well as items for gender reveal parties.< /text>

As far as the 3D-4D I thought it would be a lot clearer. My baby was not being photogenic and that’s a risk you gotta take....but the images I did see of him you could see his features but quality was very blurry. Even the pics I got printed are soo blurry and those were the “best” ones.. I have a 3D photo that my doc took within a few minutes at a checkup that was more clear than these.  I definitely feel jipped on the money I spent for the package I got for the “quality” I received.< /Review></record>

Blessings studio is a great place to share such a life changing experience. The staff is always nice and welcoming and make all the difference as soon as you walk-in. Every time I’ve called they always accommodate and are always friendly over the phone. Margarita made sure I was able to be seen due to my tight schedule. Yesenia and Alexis made my 4D experience the most memorable and I felt very comfortable sharing the experience with them. Defiantly recommned and will come back for my other ultrasounds in the future.</Review>

This place is amazing! Yesenia made me feel so comfortable and she was so sweet and professional, I’m 10 weeks pregnant and we were worried it was too early to hear the babies heartbeat but she found it right away and we were also able to see the baby be super active moving it’s feet and arms, it was so adorable. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is pregnant. My husband and I will be back in 4 weeks to find out the gender of our baby.< /Review>

Absolutely love this place they answered on the first call after they opened the person who answered was helpful and caring i got a quick same  day appointment and had the best ultrasound tech ive ever had YESENIA ❤ she had great bed side manner didnt  make me feel uncomfortable and was such a sweet person i will definitely come back just because of her.  Love this place. Update *** i went for a 4d ultrasound and i met another amazing girl here eliana! She tried so hard to get my babys face and was so sweet and it paid off we finally got to see her face! After 3 times trying at sweet cheeks with no luck i finally got to see my baby's face here at blessings! im more than pleased with this company they are the nicest and really try to make all their costumers happy! I will always come here love love love and thank you girls!!!< /review>

<review>Blessings 3D is so perfect. They always have awesome deals to accomodate your needs! Ive been to blessings for 2 of my gender reveals and I wouldnt go to any other place. I was 14wks 6days and went in for my gender ultrasound Yesenia was my Tech shes so sweet and was very caring and took her time to assure me i was in fact having my Boy.. Im a mommy of 4 girls 1 boy so when she gave me my results she turned into my favorite person...she was also as excited as i was! The waiting room is cozy with couches a little small but once you get pulled into the back your in a huge room with a couch that fits your whole family.. With a tv screen soo big you wont miss any details. I love the fact they welcome kids and they have no limit to how many loved ones you bring. Its your memory they just help make it the best as possible. They have water if your parched i can go on and on about how amazing this place is but i say go check it out for yourself you wont be let down!!! I LOVE BLESSINGS 3D!! Big thanks to Yesenia your truly a sweetheart and your passion shows!!! Keep up the great work guys..!!

Our office is by appointment only, we don't double book appointments. Reserved time slots are limited on Sunday it is unfair to other expectant mothers who couldn't be seen today. The time slot could have been filled to an expectant mother who needed a morning appointment  who called in at 9:05 am.

<review>Carly is the best!  We had a great time with Carly. She made everyone feel so comfortable and was able to capture the smiles of my 2 kids( 2 year old & 5 month old).  She is super personable, worked quickly and professionally. We love all the amazing photos! Can't wait for another photo shoot with her in the coming year.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808580653e0be1f5:0x1e893843cf59b12<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Carly is incredible.  I have two very high-energy kids (1.5 and 4yo) and Carly managed to get a beautiful set of family photos in 25 minutes.  She is friendly, clear with her instructions, and (of course most importantly) produces stunning family photos.  I can't wait to see what she does with us next year...</text><UserId.>109322496949803588831<//UserId.>< date>

We used Carly for a recent maternity shoot and had a terrific experience from beginning to end. She was responsive and efficient from the get go and helped set up a last minute shoot for us. We were able to shoot in the location that we wanted and with a time that worked well with our schedule. She made efficient use of the time during the shoot itself and got us to some really gorgeous spots and helped cover a lot of ground without feeling rushed. It's clear she knows where the good photo opportunities are in each of these locations. She also was great in getting us to loosen up and look natural in the photos. We received a set of photos to review within days; they were edited well, were beautiful, and captured what we were hoping to capture during this very special time.</Review>

We had a great experience with Carly, and the photos turned out great. She knew exactly what she was going for, had a wonderful eye for beautiful lighting and environments, and got us at our best.

She was friendly, patient and fun to work with, and had plenty of tricks for getting delighted smiles out of our baby girl.

She was also flexible in working with our family find a time that worked for everyone, had deep knowledge of the best locations for the shoot, and was punctual during the shoot, and with the delivery of the photos.

Carly is a pro, highly recommended!< /review>

Carly was such a pleasure to work with.  She is professional, kind and patient with our large family (10 people).   Her recommendations (location, time, outfits, and lighting) were on point and she was able to work with my 10 month old and 3.5 year old.  I wanted to capture the Golden Gate Bridge in the background and the location, Baker Beach was perfect!  The images turned out amazing and I am so glad she was available during the busy holiday season.  My family was only available for a photo shoot the day after Christmas and she was available when others were not.  I would definitely recommend Carly if you want a fun, professional and personable photographer in the SF bay area.</text>

<Text>We've known Carly for a long time and have been lucky enough to use her professional photographic services for both family photos and my professional photos.  She is so easy to work with, uses only the best camera equipment, super accommodating on time and place and will work with you until you are 100% satisfied.  I would recommend Carly to anyone looking for great professional photography!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We had a family photo shoot with Carly.  She was so friendly and amazing with all my 3 boys. Although the day was foggy so we didn't get the bridge in the photos Carly assured me that they would still turn out great and yes they did. We love all of the shots she sent on to us its hard to decide on only 10. I would highly recommend Carly Tabak Photography.</text>

Carly was fantastic. We did a family mini session at the Legion of Honor. She was very professional and communicative about her vision for each picture. Carly was incredibly efficient, very decisive and directive about what looked good and what didn't, while being very approachable and collaborative with what we were looking for.  She was incredibly patient with our 9-month-old in keeping her attention and getting the perfect shot. The pictures turned out wonderfully (which we received in less than a week)!< /Text>

<Review>Our family can't wait to book our next session with Carly! She made my family, including my 4 year old daughter and 3 year old son comfortable immediately. She has great mommy instincts and my kids were asking for her to come back the day after our session. It felt like we were hanging out with a friend. She made the entire process easy from booking to the actual session to receiving our photos. I was still in the hospital with my newborn on our scheduled date and Carly was flexible with rescheduling our session. At the session, Carly was extremely patient. It's not easy to get a picture with 2 young kids AND and a newborn. Not only did she try her best to get the best shot, but my newborn was cluster feeding and awake the entire time and she waited for him to finish feeding. Also, as I'm sure most moms of young kids will know, kids are constantly playing and can make a mess of the house within a minute. Carly was understanding and came up with different ideas to overcome areas of "toy clutter" in our home. My husband and I were so happy with the photos and time that Carly spent with our family. Well worth the money!<//Review>< resp>

<text>Carly made us feel very comfortable during the photo shoot.  We loved all the photos.  It was so hard to choose the ones we wanted.  She chose a great location which worked great even though it was foggy and wet.  I loved all the information about what we should wear.  It was very helpful.  Would definitely recommend Carly for a photo shoot and will use her again in future.</text>< gmapID>

It was our first time doing professional photos as a couple. We had a great experience in our session with Carly. She is lively and entertaining. It was a cold and foggy day in SF, but our photos turned out amazing! She had our edited images returned to us in a very short timeline:), which we appreciate very much!< /Review>

Carly has done multiple photo shoots of my family over the years, and she is absolutely stellar on every level! It was incredible watching her patiently & gently transform my newborn son into a precious angel. Her props and costumes are so adorable! I only wish I’d known her when my older daughter was born. Now that my kids are toddler and preschooler age, she manages their distinct personalities with kindness, enthusiasm & grace. Thank you Carly for creating such memorable shots of my family, which we will cherish throughout our lives! Xo<//review>

<text>We just got our photos back and are blown away by how beautiful they are.

Additionally, we had such a great experience with Carly! She was warm, so incredibly nice and so organized! She gave us info on what to wear, what would look the best in photos, the time of day that would be the best, and checked in with reminders leading up to the date of our shoot. She also was incredibly responsive with all of my questions and emails and just a lovely person to spend the afternoon with getting your photo taken. :)<//text>< Resp>

We did a maternity photo shoot with Carly at the Palace of Fine Arts.  She was so easy to work with and helped us figure out what clothes to wear in advance.  She was also great at helping us pose and got some amazing photos from my very uncooperative 2 year old.  Not sure how she did it!  Would highly recommend her and plan to use her for future family photo shoots!<//review>

<text>Carly is a great photographer who understands her client needs and delivers quality pictures. We hired her for maternity shoot. Not only did she help me pick maternity outfits, but also provide ideas on shooting locations. She is very thoughtful and patient. I highly recommend Carly. She is the best.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

But the mini photo shoot was well worth it!  Our family of four (mom, dad and 2 teens) had a lot of fun with Carly.  She's relaxed and super positive-- very easy to work with!  We received our edited photos earlier than expected and they came out great!
I would recommend Carly for your photo session!<//Review>< pics>

Carly was very easy to work with- responded quickly to emails, and she made the photo shoot very fun.  She instantly put us at ease with her lively personality! Even though we only spent a half our with her, we felt like we'd known her for a lot longer. She was fun and silly with our 10 month old (which was perfect for him!) and the pictures are fantastic. Plus her turn around time was very fast! I would recommend Carly to anyone looking for a great family photographer int he Bay Area. Thanks so much, Carly!< /review>< Pics>

If you are looking for a photographer who is creative and professional, Carly is the one. We had a family photo session with Carly.  We liked that she was understanding, efficient, and well prepared. She thoroughly understood what we were looking for and was able to guide us to capture the right moments. She was particular about the lighting and setting which resulted in fabulous pictures! She talked us through the entire session and was reassuring. You can trust that Carly will provide the quality you are looking for. Even after the photo session she continued to be extremely responsive and go beyond what is customary. We will continue to use her as our photographer.< /Review>

We did a mini session with Carly recently, and it was a wonderful experience. First of all, she created a spot just for us, and gave us a date convenient for my family, which was great. She was really good at it, and the pictures are beautiful. She captured my 11 month old daughter perfectly, with very natural expressions. The whole session was a lot of fun. The lighting and composition of the pictures is just perfect. I would totally recommend carly. She is the best!!< /text>

<Review>We did a mini-shoot with Carly and had such a great time. Carly brings out the best in her subjects. Her direction during the shoot was spot-on, and she kept things on time and was efficient. She knows how to capture the best moments of fast-moving toddlers! The entire process from booking to photo delivery was fast, with clear details. Very reasonable prices for the high quality of her work!<//Review>< Pics>

We had a family session this past Father's Day weekend with Carly, and cannot say enough about her, or her work! We rarely (never) take professional photos, but Carly put us at ease immediately, was so warm, funny, and helped guide us, making things very comfortable and fun! Our pictures turned out BEAUTIFULLY. So natural, bright, and just overall stunning to look at. Our one-year-old responded so well to Carly, and made for some incredible photos. We initially found Carly based on reviews, so I'm happy to add a review for others to find! We will undoubtedly be returning clients!<//Review>

Carly did a beautiful mini session for our holiday photos. We have just moved to San Francisco and got the iconic photos in front of the Golden Gate Bridge that we wanted. She was flexible when we were running a little bit late and wonderful with our 1 year old. Almost every single picture he was staring right into the photo and smiling. Mom and dad look pretty good, too! I would highly recommend Carly and look forward to working with her again over the years.< /review>

After two bad family photo experiences, I was about to never do it again! Thank goodness for Carly...she didn't even flinch with the meltdowns. She is a true expert. She was so fast and efficient and was able to capture not only great family shots but individual ones of the kids. She is positive and high energy. She was a joy to work with and we will definitely be using her moving forward. I would highly recommend! I will cherish these photos forever!</text>

<review>Carly did a mini-shoot for our family (5 adults and a baby), and the results were fantastic! The shots of our five-months-old were particularly adorable, and we honestly had a hard time narrowing down the photos to get. Since this is our first family shoot with a professional photographer, we particularly appreciated Carly's ability to get everyone organized and to make great suggestions while also taking our preferences into account. She was also super-efficient in getting us the edited photos, a big plus given how much we were all looking forward to seeing the mini-shoot results. Her costs were very reasonable as well given the quality of her photos. All in all, really happy that we did this, and it may just turn into a new yearly tradition!</review>< Pics>

<text>Carly is AMAZING!  Let's start with what a nice and easy person she is to work with. On top of that, the photos are stunning. She was really flexible during the hour we had with her. We got photos of my daughter, our family and even a head shot for my husband. Her flexibility and diversity of subject is definitely a plus. I literally received edited photos from her in less than one week. I highly recommend her for any family moment you wish to capture!!!<//text>< rate>

Carly does amazing work.  She captured beautiful posed shots, as well as beautiful impromptu moments.  Carly was wonderful with our newborn.  She was able to efficiently photograph her while the baby was awake, but was also patient in waiting for the "great moments".  She came with a number of ideas on background, poses, props, etc. and was also open to suggestions.  For our family shoot, we met Carly at a picturesque spot in SF.  She again came with a lot of great, creative, ideas, making the most of the beautiful scenery.  Carly was able to capture a diverse set shots in a short period of time, which was very much appreciated given the limited endurance of a 5-year old and a newborn.

Our family was completely comfortable with Carly.  She is warm, personable, fun, patient (critical when dealing with kids/babies), and definitely gifted in what she does!  I plan to use Carly for our next set of family photos.< /Review><name>Jocelyn Concepcion< /name><Pics>None</Pics></record>

We did a family photo shoot with Carly at Baker Beach and were so pleased with the whole experience.  We have a 3 year old son, and 10 and 13 year old daughters, and Carly was wonderful with them all.  We originally booked a 60 minute photo session, but ended up getting a 90 minute session at no additional cost as the sun set later than expected that day and she wanted to stay and wait for the sunset so that she could capture the perfect lighting right as the sun was setting.  We received our beautiful photos earlier than expected and we couldn't be happier.  Thank you Carly!!!<//review>

I'm very happy we had our first professional family photo shoot with Carly. When I saw the proofs they made me laugh and smile.  The photos are wonderful.  She captured such positive energy and happiness; especially with our 9 and 6 year olds.   After seeing the finished product, my husband, who was skeptical on the idea of hiring a photographer for a family photo, agreed it was worth it.

Carly was on schedule, professional, friendly and personable. She offered several different San Francisco locations for the holiday mini sessions. Ours was at Crissy Field; with the backgrounds of the bridge, by the water and the city skyline. I was surprised by the number of shots she was able to get in during the 1/2 hour we were with her.  Carly made the shoot a fun experience for our family.  We received our proofs in about a week and had 30 days to decide on which ones we loved and wanted to keep.  I really enjoyed working with Carly and highly recommend having her as your professional photographer.<//Text>

<Review>Carly is just AMAZING!!! We were last minute for our Christmas card photo shoot and she just made it happen so fast! She was very flexible when we had to cancel because our daughter was sick and found a new spot in her schedule for us asap. The day of the shooting, it was our son's turn to be sick and even though he was crying all the time, she managed to grasp many amazing pictures of all of us smiling!!! Pure magic!!! And on top of everything, it was a super foggy day and despite of it, the pictures are fantastic. Carly had offered to reschedule but we decided to do it since we were so time challenged and because she had assured us the pictures would still be great... And she was right! We are so glad that we kept our spot!!! And after the photo shoot, our pictures were ready to view in 2 days!! Now we have a set of wonderful pictures for our Christmas cards and family gifts!!! Carly, you are the best!!! Thank you so much, John and Julie<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808580653e0be1f5:0x1e893843cf59b12< /gmap_id></record>

My family and I did a mini session at Crissy Field with Carly on a Sunday afternoon. We were lucky that the weather was beautiful.

Carly is a pleasure to work with. She is very detailed and organized when booking a session. She provided recommendations on what to wear and details on the location. She is also very responsive when communicating with her on both email and text.

When we met her for our session, she was very down to earth and we had an overall wonderful experience. She was quick yet detailed on the shots she took. When we got our photos we loved all of them. The location and our family through her photos were captured perfectly. I can't wait to hang them on our home!<//review>

She knew how to make us feel comfortable and confident during a family photo shoot; 2 adults, 2 kids and a baby. Carly is very open minded, flexible and receptive to who she's working with. She had plenty of great ideas, but welcomed ours as well.  She got all 5 of us to look at the camera and smile! Amazing! And she also took fantastic spontaneous photos that were some of my favorite. The added bonus is that she is really fun to hang out with! The pictures were amazing and they were more than we had hoped for.  Honestly I cannot recommend her enough!

<Review>We did a mini shoot with Carly at the Palace of Fine Arts and it was great working with her. She  made great use of our time and took photos at a number of different spots at the Palace of Fine Arts. We have a very energetic 5 year old son and Carly did a great job of working with him. The 25 minute photo shoot was the perfect amount of time for us (our son was maxed out after that). Even though she only spent 25 minutes with us, we had a lot of good photos to choose from. She sent us our edited photos to review in less than a week - much faster than I had expected.< /Review><UserId.>115027972237266638370< /UserId.>< name>

We just had our first a mini session with Carly and are beyond thrilled with the results!  She was able to shoot my whole family including the dogs (3 dogs) which was really important to us.  This was also our first professional session with our baby who is now 6.5 months old.  I wished I had done this sooner!  I definitely won't be waiting 6.5 months to shoot our next session!</Text>

We just had an amazing session with Carly on Sat and got our pictures today (Wed!).  Given SF unpredictable weather, she was flexible and creative and got us fabulous shots.  She has a great eye and way of framing her shots.  With two young kids of her own, she understood the challenges of working with our two young kids.  We were so lucky to have found her and cannot wait to share our photos!<//Text>

Carly did such a great job on the mini session for my family. She is quick to answer any questions beforehand. When we got to the location she was very high energy and made us feel so comfortable. My young daughter is not one to smile for pictures, but she still managed to get her to crack a few smiles and the ones where she isn't smiling turned out so great that it didn't even matter.
Carly sent me the images very quickly afterwards. She had agreed to send us 10, and in the end sent us 13 (I emailed her after she sent the 10 asking for one where my husband had better posture). She was more than accommodating and makes we want to take professional photos all the time! I will definitely be going back to her next time our family needs professional photos.<//Text>

<text>We booked Carly for a newborn session with our two week old daughter. Carly responded to our inquiry promptly and was easy to schedule. She came to our home and brought all of her own props and supplies. She was definitely prepared! She instantly made me, the baby, and my husband feel comfortable and at ease with the camera.

She told us it would be a few weeks before we received the finished photos but she really only took a few days. We were very happy with the photos. They were bright, polished, and candid. Carly did a great job! I would definitely recommend her services.<//text><rate>5<//rate>< user>

Carly is awesome.  My wife and I haven't done a very good job of documenting her 2nd pregnancy so we asked Carly to help out.  She is easy going but knows how to get it done.  She helped us figure out everything from what clothes to wear, the shoot locations, etc.  This made the process easy and stress free.  When we did it we were all well prepared and everything clicked.  She finished editing the photos the next day and it was instant gratification.  Overall working with her was fun, easy and the results are incredible.  We couldn't be happier.  Thanks!</Review>

Carly was wonderful for our mini session with our 6 month old. We had to do a last minute reschedule due to rain, and she was very flexible and responsive in the process. She was fun and friendly during the session, the baby did well with her, and Carly and captured quite a few great ones within the short 1 hour session. We had many awesome digital images of both the baby and the family within a few days; I appreciate how much she made it super easy to get frame-able prints quickly. Highly recommended!<//text>

<review>Carly was wonderful to work with, she was sweet and funny and got a lot of fabulous shots despite my rather uncooperative 3yo who had just woken up from nap who was getting everyone frazzled. Being a mom herself, she was great with kids and definitely knew how to work with them. The photos turned out beautiful. We will definitely hire her again and recommend her to all our family friends. Did I mention how prompt she is on email too? A consummate professional overall!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808580653e0be1f5:0x1e893843cf59b12< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Growing up with a photographer dad whose passion is candids, I was a life-long disbeliever of the posed shot (so much so that our kids' (aged 6 and 10) first EVER professional photo shoot was this past week with Carly Tabak). Carly is amazing - kind, generous of spirit, thoughtful and talented. The shoot was fun and light-hearted, yet very creative and professional. She put our entire family at ease. Carly had scouted out great sites at Chrissy Field in advance, had thought through imagery, palettes and textures. She really understands the unique lighting in San Francisco, particularly in light of the micro-climate weather (fog). The picture proofs were provided to us within a few days and we are all delighted by the results. I'm really happy I met Carly, we're 100% satisfied with her work and this normally "candid" gal will definitely be returning for more shoots as the kids grow. Thank you Carly!<//Text>

Carly was great during our mini-session. She arrived early and was completely ready w/ terrific angles and location suggestions that took advantage of the lighting. My kids were being extra difficult (one had skipped her nap, and the other is well, a 3-year old), and Carly was engaging and patient, and still managed to get in some great shots even though it was a mini-session. I credit that to Carly really knowing exactly how to make the best use of the time, in any given location. The beautifully edited photos arrived just days later, way faster than expected. We'd definitely use Carly again for photoshoots in the future!<//text>

We had a fabulous experience with Carly. She is professional and knowledgable, but also easy-going and fun. Even my shy boy warmed up to her immediately! Our shoot was very enjoyable, shooting among several great backdrops in a short amount of time. We got our proofs quicker than expected and they are beautiful! The problem is going to be narrowing the down...I want them all!</Review>

We worked with Carly for a family mini-session last week and it was a wonderful experience – Carly was professional and easy-going and we couldn’t be happier with how the photos came out. Our 20-month old son is a bundle of energy and it’s difficult for him to stay still, but Carly was able to capture a ton of great shots of him smiling into the camera. We held the session outdoors near the Golden Gate Bridge and Carly found an amazing variety of backdrops to complement what everyone wanted (us, grandparents, baby). She gave everyone great direction and made us all very comfortable. We would definitely work with Carly again in the future and recommend her to others looking for a great family or baby photographer!</text>

We did a mini-session with Carly last week and are super happy with the results! Our daughter wasn't in a great mood on the day of our shoot, but Carly was able to make us all comfortable and managed to get some beautiful shots, even with our squirmy 18 month old. During our mini-session, she even managed to squeeze in a few quick maternity shots for me, which turned out great. Definitely recommend Carly's photography services, especially for families!< /Review>

We hired Carly to take some family photos. She is extremely warm and generous with her time. We never felt rushed, and she made sure to check in with us on what types of shots we wanted (in addition to suggesting her own compositions, of course). Our girls were getting really bored and antsy towards the end, but Carly still managed to squeeze a few more great shots. Carly if fun, upbeat, and a pleasure to work with. I would definitely recommend her!< /Review>

She made our photo shoot fun and had a lot of great ideas on not only where she thought we would get the best pictures, but also different poses to try. She gave feedback as we were shooting (even when the pictures were turning out awkward, which I appreciated). We got our pictures in less than 1 week. I would definitely recommend Carly and will use her again in the future.<//Review>< userid>

Like so many others here, we are very pleased with the way our family photos turned out!
Our 1 year old and 3 year old daughters aren't really that excited about photos, but Carly had some great tools to help loosen them up.  We were in a wooded area and she told us to give them sticks and almost immediately the kids attitudes turned around.  Carly was available on relatively short notice (2-3 weeks) and helped us get ready for the shoot with clothing options online and a variety of places as options for shoots.  The reason she is limited on selection for shooting location is because she's clearly done her homework on the locations available and knows exactly where the best shots and lighting are.  This means that for the time you are there, you will get a higher concentration of good shots.  We will definitely hire Carly again next year!<//Text>

<Review>Best photo session for our family to date.  My kids don't typically enjoy having their photos taken but Carly had the kids running on the beach and having a great time, which was reflected in their natural smiles.  The mini session was quick but the perfect length of time as Carly knew all of the best locations and angles for photos at Crissy field.  And we received our proofs in less than a week!< /Review>< Pictures>

I would highly recommend Carly Tabak Photograpy!! Carly captured our family of 7 (including our little 9-month old) in an outdoor setting in such a wonderful way! The way Carly framed us in photographs is remarkable----she is a true artist!! And the fun thing is, she is a very positive person who made the experience fun!! If you are considering having Carly do your shoot, just go ahead and sign up. You will not regret your decision!!< /Text>

<Text>I can't believe it took me so long to find Carly. Aside from being a super sweet and bubbly person, she took the best photos of our family we've ever had.  We were in various weddings this past year with professional photographers galore, but it was Carly who finally gave us the family photos I've been dreaming of. She is lovely to be around - she even made my cranky 3-year-old smile - and her work is fantastic. Holiday cards are usually a chore for us, but this year, due to Carly's work, I can't wait to get them out!< /Text><rating>5<//rating>< date>

I hired Carly to do a Father's Day shoot for my husband, who complains that we never have any good "family photos." Our 2 1/2 year-old son is full of energy and not the easiest to photograph. Carly showed tremendous patience and had the necessary skills to capture several great images of our son and family. Photos were turned around very quickly and my husband now has several images that he will cherish forever. I would definitely recommend Carly to anyone looking for a qualified photographer!< /Text>

Carly was prompt, efficient, professional and was so fun and friendly. She was even thoughtful enough to deliver our images early so we could use them for holidays.

So it's 2 weeks before Christmas and we wrapped up a very last minute photoshoot with Carly with the hope to send our first official 'family holiday cards' before 2018 is here. Not only was Carly super accommodating with our busy schedules as first-time parents, but somehow Carly was able to snap 200+ photos in an one-hour time frame ...wow were we impressed with how efficient the shoot went!

Fast forward a few days, Carly managed to edit the photos in lightning speed and I am just in awe with how beautiful the pictures came out. If you are looking for the perfect photographer for your next big event, I would HIGHLY recommend working with Carly...you won't regret it!<//review>

We did a mini shoot with Carly last weekend and were so pleased! She put us right at ease and helped us pick the best spots to photograph. Even though it was a mini shoot, she gave us some extra time. We just got the pictures - less than a week after the shoot- and they're perfect! Our LO (13 months) was ready for his nap, but she sang and played games with him to keep him smiling and happy for the photos. I could not recommend her enough. Simply fabulous!</text>

I found Carly's art pieces through website and loved it so much. So my husband and I decided to have her take our photos while we're in SF. We are very happy with the result ! She's very charming and has very nice personality. It was a fun photo session and very memorable one.
We are very pleased with the result.</review>< Time>

<Text>Awesome awesome pictures! Carly did our family shoot (2 adults & an infant) and we couldn't have chosen a better person for the shoot. From the very first conversation to get a quote and timing, to the actual shoot, to the final delivery - everything has been super smooth with Carly. She was even able to reschedule my shoot within a short notice.
My first thought when I saw the quote was 'dude she's expensive', but it's well worth it. We got a lot of pictures in an hour. I was initially disappointed with the foggy weather, but Carly assured us and made sure the lighting is perfect. Our pictures turned out amazing! If you are looking for a professional photographer, definitely try Carly!</Text>< pics>

We did a 90 min session with a little troublemaker, but Carly handled it heads on and even though our little one was getting antsy towards the end, the session was great, we loved her enthusiasm and were amazed she got so much done in 90 min. I would tell all my friends to have her take their amazing family pictures. Needless to say, we loved our pictures once they arrived. Priceless moments with our little baby girl captured in the best possible way. Thanks a lot, Carly.</text>

<Text>We had a fantastic mini session with Carly and we are in love with our new family photos! Carly was on time, directive in all the right ways during the shoot, efficient in a short timeframe, and managed to get our 1yr old and 3.5 yr old to smile (which is no easy task). From signing up for the photo session, to help with outfit direction, to quick turn around of the photo gallery, we are very impressed and happy with the process and most importantly the outcome. Highly recommend!</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

She is easy to work with and is a natural at photographing people. Somehow she managed to get my three kids (6 and under) all looking at the camera and smiling! In addition to taking amazing photos, her turnaround time is super quick. After this experience, I know we will be working with Carly again for our family photos in the years to come.<//review>< rating>

We are so happy with our photos by Carly! My friend told me about her mini session and their photos were so pretty. We did the mini session at the Legion of Honor and they were so great. I was doubtful because our 3 year old had just woken up from her nap (ie cranky!) but Carly was engaging and friendly and got the best out of my girls. I hope to make this an annual tradition!</Review>

Carly is a fantastic photographer.  She took pictures of our 4-month-old daughter, and they came out amazingly.  We wish we had known her when our older son was born!  Carly was able to capture beautiful pictures right there in our condo with just a few accessories.  And she did a great job getting our daughter to smile and look at the camera - normally an impossible task with a distracted and squirmy infant.  Carly also captured a number of poses, which made for a good variety of photos.

We definitely recommend her for any occasion.</Review>

Carly was a joy to work with for our mini maternity session last month. She captured the occasion perfectly, made us feel wonderfully at ease, and delivered our photos to us faster than promised. It was such an incredibly easy process, and what a value compared to other photographers we have worked with!!  Highly recommended.<//review>

Carly did an exceptional job with our family / maternity shoot! She did an amazing job during the shoot capturing gorgeous photos of my wife and our family, all while getting our 3 yr old son to sit still and smile. The final edits were even more amazing! I would highly recommend Carly.</review>

I was determined to have Golden Gate bridge photos for our family Holiday cards this year.  Some internet research led me to Carly and we booked one of her 'mini sessions' (25 minutes for 10 high res PDF photos).  From the beginning, Carly was responsive and flexible, even squeezing us in on a busy day in between her other clients when we were hoping for a certain weekend.

On the day of our photo shoot, my son got car sick and threw up all over himself and his 'nice clothes' and was crying (red puffy eyes).  Then we arrived in the City and the beautiful Fall late afternoon photo shoot we'd hoped for was completely and totally fogged in, cold, gray and windy.  You could seriously only see about 6 feet of the bottom of the bridge!  I wanted to turn around and go home under the covers.

Carly was so positive and upbeat and got us all in a better mood fast.  She took us to a few different scenic locations and we were all laughing a few minutes in.

I was hopeful for one picture that we could use from that day.  Well, less than a week later than our session, she emailed me our pictures and I was totally and completely blown away by how good they were!  There were about 20 that I really really liked.  Everyone looked really good with 'real' smiles and you would never know it was actually a super gray, crying, yucky cold day.

She is very talented, worked quickly and professionally and was super nice.  Not only is she wonderful, but her work and the pictures were really great (and I'm pretty picky about these things!).  The lighting looked good, shots were candid and fun and the different backgrounds she used turned out great (although never did get my whole bridge picture because of the fog, but we can always try again with Carly next year!)<//review>

Carly came over to take pictures of our 1 week old and we also tasked her with taking our Christmas photo with the uncooperative family dog. Carly was so easy to work with, friendly, supportive and more than anything patient. The photos came out great and overall we had a great experience. I will be using her again and would highly recommend for those looking for great family photos.<//review>

<text>Carly makes you feel totally relaxed in front of the camera, it was almost like she wasn't there and managed to capture some beautifully candid shots, which is exactly what we were looking for. I would highly recommend anyone for this; She is a natural with kids and the camera and the photos along with the memory of the day is something we will always treasure.

We had a photo session with Carly on July 1st and we got the photos already! Those photos are elegant, beautiful and super natural. Our baby Emily is a preemie but Carly managed to catch her smile! Our condo is rather small and my husband uses a wheelchair. Carly managed to make use of the space and limited sunlight. The photo session is easy and we're very happy that we had Carly as our photographer.< /Text>

<Text>We did a first birthday photo shoot with our son. Since we were on vacation to San Francisco at the time, Carly was nice enough to accommodate us. The pre-session calls were very helpful and so were the emails (suggestions on what to wear, how to get to the location, etc) Carly was also very attentive to what I wanted in terms of poses, and during the shoot made sure we covered everything on our wish-list. The session was fun and relaxed, which was what we wanted! The photos turned out lovely. It was a great way to remember our first born's first birthday.<//Text>< Pictures>

Carly recently did a shoot for my family to celebrate our son's 1 year birthday.  He was not too pleased to be having his photo taken that day - didn't want to sit still, didn't want to smile, didn't want to look at the camera etc - but Carly did everything possible to try to make the best of the hour we had planned together!  She has kids and clearly knows how to try and get their attention (and smiles).  I really appreciated that she tried so many different tricks and also appreciated that she directed us on where to go and how to stand, etc.
Given how uncooperative our little guy was, I'm still really pleased with the photos and would go back to her if/when we have pictures taken again.< /Text>

She did my maternity photos and I loved how they turned out. She made me feel beautiful and confident at 30 weeks pregnant. We were so comfortable with her and that was so important to me, to us. My husband was relaxed and we all had so much fun. She had wonderful ideas for poses that really came out in the photos. I did not realize how hard it is to pose and look and feel natural. She made it easy. In an hour she was able to get several different looks as if they were 6 different shoots! Different locations and outfits changes really gave the diversity we were looking for.

Naturally we hired her for when our little guy came. I was so excited to work with her again. The photos came out better then I ever could imagine with a newborn. He did not cry and loved the attention. It was so much fun playing dress up with him. The photos turned out so beautifully. Everyone was talking about our announcement cards and how gorgeous the photos were. Every few months we will have Carly take photos of our little one. It's nice to know Carly is reliable and gets me the photos so quickly. I get so excited to see them. I can not wait for our next shoot!</Review><username>Elissya Bar-EL<//username></record>

I could not be happier with how our family photos at Crissy Field turned out.  Carly was so helpful with everything from selecting our photo shoot location and even helping us decide what to wear.  She was so patient with our large, disorganized family and was great with the baby too!  We had to reschedule our initial photo shoot  because our baby got sick that weekend, but Carly was so flexible and understanding.  It's refreshing to work with someone who cares and does a great job too!  I was referred to Carly by someone in my mommy group on facebook, and I can honestly say this was one of the best referrals I've ever gotten.  I won't hesitate to book our next photo shoot with Carly.<//text>

I have already recommended her to my co-workers as they also loved the beautiful shots she captured of us. I will definitely keep her in mind for any type of pictures in the near future!< /text>< Pictures>

Carly came to my apartment for the session and was right at home there.  She is very good with giving creative direction (finding the right light and positioning) and was able to work with what we had at home to make it feel more personal and natural.  Even though my son got a bit fussy during the session Carly was able to go with the flow and was not fazed at all, she even helped him calm down!

She sent the finished images promptly after the session and they look amazing.  We look forward to continuing to work with her for our family photos in the future!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808580653e0be1f5:0x1e893843cf59b12< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>We had a wonderful family mini-session with Carly at Cavallo Point.  She was patient with our squirmy and impatient 18-month old, and had lots of tricks up her sleeve to keep him smiling and tolerant.  I was sure that given our son's testy mood that our pictures wouldn't come out well but they were just gorgeous!  She got them to us quickly and texted me when they were ready, so I could view them right away (made my day).  Great communication throughout the process.  Plus Carly is so friendly and fun.  Highly recommend!</review>< Pics>

<review>Carly provided a steady hand when it came time to get some updated social media and professional headshots. She listened to what I was hoping to achieve, spent the time scouting locations before the shoot, and produced excellent finished pictures which she delivered seamlessly though Dropbox. While her package price struck me as a little high initially given schedule length of the shoot, it provided to be great value once i understood all the behind the scenes work she did scouting, touching up and delivering the final photos. I recommend her without reservation.</review>< pics>

Carly's passion and enthusiasm for her work comes through in every photo she takes. She has a gift of making shoots extraordinarily comfortable and so much fun. The finished product will certainly exceed your expectations. If you need portrait or family photos look no further - Carly Tabak Photography is the place to go!!< /text>

<Review>Carly knew the perfect spots to take a Cavallo Point. Cavallo Point was a good alternate to Crissy Fields, which was busy during fleet week. She got great photos of my 16 month old during our minishoot, which was the perfect amount of time for having a toddler. The photos turned out amazing and can't wait to have them printed out. Thank you Carly!<//Review>< pics>

Carly recently did a portrait shoot for my professional head shot. I used this photo on my linkedin and social media sites. She did a great job! I highly recommend her.< /review>

Carly is fabulous!! She's fun and patient and extremely talented. We had never done a family photo shoot before and I really regretted it. When I met Carly we instantly became friends and when I realized she was a photographer and saw her work, I knew we had a great opportunity to get our photos done. I was always nervous about getting everything just right and dealing with little kiddos, but she made it fun and easy.

Carly was really generous with her time. We really wanted Fort Mason because that is our favorite family spot. She hadnt photographed there before, so she went and checked it out beforehand and got some great ideas. It was absolutely freezing and windy and the fog was messing with the sunlight. She was super calm and patient. We trekked all around the area to find great light and spots, and we actually forgot all about the weather and had a great time. The kids loved running around and playing up to the camera and getting all the attention.

It was obvious that Carly just wanted us to have a fun and natural and relaxed shoot.

The proof was in the photos! They were beautiful and amazing. We love them and our family and friends are still raving about them. You could barely tell it was windy and the light and the poses were great. We are so thrilled we finally had this done and that it was with Carly. We highly recommend her for any photo needs!</review>

<text>After 7 months of not having a haircut, I made an appointment at D&R Barbershop.  First impressions, clean, professional, welcoming establishment.  My hair had grown into a form of it's own I let Jeremy "take the wheel".  (I just didn't want to end up bald).  The man delivered and I'm happy to report that my dog recognizes me again.  Definitely going back.<//text><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

Seven barbers were working and not one bad haircut left the shop. These guys and girls are professionals. Best haircut I've gotten in the Oakland area. Will definitely be back every two weeks. Darnell did a great job. Highly recommend this spot.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808f95ec1678a01d:0x9eb90b2e24445543</GmapID></record>

<text>The only place that got me the right haircut. My wife loves my new hairdo! Jeremy was awesome! Took his time fading my hair and advising the right thing to do. I would definitely come back here and be a regular. The Barbers were also very professional and respectful to their clients.

I recommend this place without hesitation.

I tried several places over the past few years (barbers and salons) but never quite pleased.... mainly the lack of good, positive customer interaction.  If I'm paying for service, I expect to be treated as an appreciated patron.

This barbershop exceeded my  customer service expectations, and the hair cut was exactly as "the doctor ordered".... the first time!

Ray was "The Man".... and i'll be back to see him again.

Thanks much, gents!</Review>

Reached 5 mins before appointment time and waited 40 mins for the barber to free up. Didnt get the hair cut.
Very Disappointed. Total waste of time. The place did look cool though, pity they give a damn about customer time. They acting like they don't need any new customers.<//Review>

After months searching for a decent place locally that can do beards and hair, finally found one! D+R does a fantastic job, taking the time to really make you look and feel your best. If setting an appointment, ask for Ray or Jeremy for an awesome cut.< /review>

Union City isn't my usual stomping ground but I was in the area with a few hours to kill and an unruly mop of hair on my head. D&R popped up on my search and I decided to take a chance. Boy am I glad I did. I didn't have an appointment so I had to wait about 30 minutes but the haircut and friendly service was well worth the wait. I ended up with Jeremy (second chair from the door on the right) and he did a fantastic job.  I might have to accidentally end up in Union City again in about 6-8 week. Tips: make an appointment and bring cash.</Text>

<review>Darn  (I meant another word)  this was just like going into the movie.   As a white guy who grew up in Oak-Town back in the 70's these guys just kick it old style.   Best darn hair cut that I have had in 15-25 years.   Gordon was my guy but I am sure the other gentlemen will do just the same quality job.

Sheeesh when I lived in Palo Alto, they would charge me 3 times the price for 1/4 of the time.

This is a real barber shop.

Smaller location that focuses more on books and movies than clothing and furniture, which is fine by me. It's got the usual bargain prices and a very friendly, laid back staff. Only thing is that those shelves are mad dusty! I thought it was just me but then I heard another lady having a sneezing fit while looking at the books. Other than that it's a nice lil spot.</text>

I love their sweet hot sauce! It reminds me of the Asian Zing at Buffalo Wild wings and I love that sauce so much I always buy their bottles of sauce. If this reminds me of that sauce, it means it's really good! I always get the wings when I go. My boyfriend loves the Cali heat and he'll get the chicken sandwich and sliders in that sauce. If your in the mood for fried chicken sandwiches, this is a great spot.</Review>

The breading looks intimidating however it had a mild flavor. Not overpowering at all. The chicken was very tender. The bread was soft. It was a very delicious sandwich.</text></record>

I got the Cali heat and lemon pepper sliders and that ranch is amazing.  I gave it a 4 only because the buns should be heated, it would add that extra umph. Other than that I will definitely be back.</text>

Fyrebird is located right across the street (Crenshaw/Manhattan Beach Blvd)from El Camino Community College inside a small strip mall. Parking here he plentiful with two-disabled spaces which includes one van access and one regular.

Once inside, their menu is on their entrance wall, simple menu with gourmet tasting food. If you were planning on dining in, bring a table because they only have two chairs, yes, only two chairs...😅<//text>

How big is your bite? Fyrebird serves up plump, juicy chicken sandwiches, tenders, and wings! Lots of flavors, including their special “fyrebird sauce”. Levels of spicy range from mild, warm, spicy, and FIRE. We had some of each. Friendly service - they greeted me like I was a neighbor, a local friend (right across from El Camino College - there is a student discount too). Excited to add this small business to our rotation!< /text>

I wasn't super astounded but maybe because this place is so hyped up I was expecting a bit more. Don't get me wrong this place is delicious but just didn't live up to all the hype for me. I would definitely try the sandwich again maybe with the waffles next time but would not wait 2-3 hours for this.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>The heat to taste ratio is perfect on the fyrebird style sandwich. Is it the hottest? No. But that's what I really enjoy about this place. The flavor of the seasoning and sauce, the textured crunch of the crispy chicken, the soft and fluffy toasted bun all come together for one amazing sandwich that keeps me returning. Even the sweet heat flavored chicken strips are perfectly yummy and sticky for a filling lunch. Highly recommend, will be returning as often as I can.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Ordered chicken sandwich and fries. Food was frozen for so long the meat was dark from the inside and rubbery on the edges. Same with fries. They were stale.

Their food is DELICIOUS! The Fyrebird chicken sandwich packed some heat, but not too much where it's hard to enjoy. The fries were similar to In N Out fries, freshly cut and fried. I wish their wings were crispier, it seemed like they were crispy and the sauce smothered out the crisp.
I think their dipping sauces are homemade because they tasted so fresh and AMAZING. I could spend all day with a mess of their fries and dipping sauces.

Their staff is super nice and welcoming, too. I'll definitely be back.< /Text>

<Text>Ong , it was so delicious. The customer service was on point. I ordered the family pack. Every piece was cooked right. The fries taste homemade..yum. I had 3 different flavors..I couldn't tell which was best, all were amazing. It was my first time. I live down the street. I see long lines here all the time. I had to try. Now I see why. 5 stars.. so good.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Honestly. This is better than Chick-Fil-A. I got the Lemon Pepper Chicken sandwich and filled my fix of wing stop lemon pepper flavor and a Chick-Fil-A sandwich all in one. Definitely recommend. Boyfriend had the Honey Chipotle chicken sandwich, rated at 4 spicy but good over all, said it wasn't that spicy but delicious nonetheless. I am definitely returning. Next try- Cali Hot chicken sandwich.< /review>< user_id>

They give you a lot of food. The menu says "2 sliders" but it's more like 2 full sandwiches, the biggest sliders I've seen by far. The "Hot" flavor is pretty hot but not unbearable in my opinion. I'm going to try the "Extra Hot" and the Reaper when I go back! Thanks for the good service.< /review>

This is better than any chicken I've ever tasted. Everything was tender and it never dried out. The fries are like N and Out but better. I immediately put my family on.</Text>

Tried for first time and really happy with the quality of the sandwich.  Ordered a lemon pepper and a honey chipotle (honey chipotle was the clear winner for me). Crispy, flavorful and extremely filing. Will continue to support through these COVID times... and beyond.</review>

They care about the elderly. The main building is closed because of covid but when they are open they have classes just for the elderly. Dancing, arts n crafts, bingo, cards & more. Every 3rd Wednesday, you can drive through and they give a big box of food, it's wonderful & has helped us out in our time of need!<//review>

This is a amazing center! It has classes for fitness, health awareness, and so much more..don't miss out on the clothing store with great finds and save so much money. Varied events, really a wonderful facility to keep you active and social.</Review>

<Review>Dr. Hsieh,
is always so thorough and he explains everything in simple terms so that I can understand. I have recommended Dr. Hsieh to some of my friends and family.
If they had a 10 star rating I would give him the 10 stars.
Thank you Dr. Hsieh!< /Review>< pictures>

Dr. Hsieh was very kind and knowledgeable. He went over every procedure that he performed at my appointment. He made it easy to understand what the test performed were and why I needed them. He showed me my results right on the spot. He made sure I was clear on what I was observing. Very professional. The staff were equally as helpful and knowledgeable. I would recommend this facility to everyone.< /Text>

The doctor is always very kind and always has an answer for any question that I may have for my glasses and or contacts, his other employees are also very helpful when it came to insurance questions and even helped me choose the perfect pair or glasses and sunglasses! I loved the experience I had, very friendly and very supportive team!< /Text>

He explained nicely my current prescription and the new one, that if there is any problem with the new one i can go ahead and take another exam. Also explained the exam for a deeper look at your retina. I will definitely continue to go to him for eye exams! Really nice optometrist!!< /text>< pics>

Michael is efficient and treats your eye's if they were his kids or wife's eye's. If you want to get in and out or want the complete detail's of your eye's health and if you have any question's like i did, he will take the time to make sure you completely understand your concerns. Micheal is very considerate and listen's very well, lots of eye contact and smiles all the time, very afordable.</Text>

I would highly recommend Dr Hsieh! He is an amazing OD. He was super kind and friendly. Very personable! He took his time with my exam and explained things to me in a way that works for me.</Review>

Dr. Hsieh was excellent. Very professional the staff is always pleasant. He didnt try to push anything extra. My prescription only changed slightly but insisted I finish out the contacts I still had before buying more.< /Review>

<Text>I'm a repeat client! I'm very satisfied with Dr. Hsieh's professional diagnosis &  the way he talks to me with a comfortable tone. Love his Optomap machine which enabled me to see the eye section behind my eyes on his computer; that was exciting! I already have an appointment set for next year...that's cool ☺<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
This was the best eye exam experience I've EVER had! I've been wearing glasses for 15 years and can guarantee this is the only place I'll come to ever again.

First, I loved the convenience of being able to book an appointment online. Leading up to the appointment, I received confirmation emails and texts, which I appreciated.

The staff in front were very kind, helpful, courteous, and made me feel very welcomed. I'm a new patient so I just had to fill out one quick sheet of paperwork. Shortly after, I was greeted by Dr. Hsieh and taken to the back to get things rolling.

Dr. Hsieh was very professional, kind, and made me feel very comfortable. He explained every little thing he did and was very accepting of questions and comments I had throughout the appointment. He was very knowledgeable and also gave me the most thorough exam I've ever had! I felt like he genuinely cared about helping me see correctly, which was so nice considering the last place I went to was the complete opposite.

The last exam I had, the doctor was cold, rude and annoyed. He just wanted to get the appointment over with. He then messed up my lenses, and lied about it twice to me! Word of advice; NEVER go to Clearview Eye Care in Lancaster, CA.

In conclusion, Target Optical was the best eye experience I've ever had. I very much look forward to giving them my business in the future as well as seeing Dr. Hsieh again.< /Review>

Great service, great employees, but I have to give a 1 star for the new sizes. Only smalls for coffees and shakes? I get an iced coffee or shake every time. Got a small iced coffee and without the ice it’s not even 3/4 of a cup. It feels like a way to make more money at the expense of the customer.

I hope management considers adding back higher-cost mediums and larges.</Text>

I have to admit, IT WAS DELICOUS. The first time I got it, I got medium and it had a little bite. But I went up to hot the second time I bought it "hot" and it was a huge difference. The heat was tolerable but it was a bit hot for me. Friend tell me to order "medium plus" the next time and it was perfect.<//Review>

The best French toast!!!  We love to get breakfast here on Sunday mornings.  Coffee is fresh and good, my French toast always yummy, and Tony loves the breakfast burrito. I highly recommend for breakfast, but their hamburgers are amazing at lunch time too!  Order a small fries, and there is enough for two people!< /Review>

Back again at almost my home away from home. Nicole from the San Gabriel branch works here now....very cool to have a familiar face greet us here when we arrive. The staff are very helpful and attentive with what ever request or need. The food is still great. Extra fresh meats and the veggies are never old. The golden fish balls.....all I have to say is I'm surprised they don't run out daily with this item! GOLDEN FISHBALLS!!!! It's like meat crack, oh so good and has a nice delicate finish in flavor. Always get the side condiments of onion, garlic and cilantro....< /Review>

Food is a hit and miss like with every fast food restaurant. What really brings this place out is their drive thru management. The line maybe long but they keep it moving efficiently, a quickly, like a well oiled machine.< /Text>

We ordered the Memorial Day Weekend special with our choice of steaks, sides, and desserts.  With this special we grilled the steaks ourselves. The steaks were beautifully marinated and presented. The entire presentation, from the personalized instructions to the way the food was prepared and packaged was fantastic. Everything was so delicious. we really enjoyed it.  And it was a real value.  Kudos to Chick-fil-A!!!!</text>

food was good. interior somewhat charming. parking on street or in back lot.
would give a higher review, but I found one long black hair in my food
and was given no offer of compensation for this situation.
of course this could happen anywhere - but it shouldn't.<//text>

This is my first time going to Chick-fil-A.I went because I keep seeing these long lines and I wanted to see what that was all about. It's okay I did like the peppermint shake.Haven't had time to taste the mac and cheese yet I'll have that tonight with my salmon.< /Text>

<Review>Took a long time to receive order. They dont accept cash or allow you to order over the counter, only through the app. Shakes were good. Fries were mediocre and they didn't fill the fry cup up.</Review>< response>

This location has been open less than a week. I will re-review it in the future as it's still in opening transition.

Location opened recently and it supersedes a long-standing Denny's and gas station on the diligent corner in the suburbs. I'm an allegiant Chick-fil-A customer so ecstatic to optically discern it determinately open.

The layout of the parking lot and drive through looks good if the drive-thru queue doesn't overflow.  I relish how it's designed as its much better than other locations.

Since there are better Chick-fil-A locations for lunch and dinner, this location fills the breakfast void.

Went twice for breakfast with mediocre results. Ceased in for an egg white sandwich the first time and just had to wait several minutes even though there were no other customers inside, just a car at drive through. Coffee additionally authoritatively mandated.

Second time sat for a scrambled egg bowl with chicken. Coffee again. Items were missing though authoritatively mandated on the app so had to ask for them.

The employee-to-customer ratio right now is about 4-to-1. Lots of training going on and employees dining. Consummately fine. But what transpires when the training ends.

Looking forward to this location getting its bearings.<//review>

I’m usually a big fan of this location but today I finally decided to say something about them not filling up my extra large fry after the employee who handed it to me acknowledged it wasn’t full and said that I should ask the manager to get it filled up. I politely asked Michael and he politely said that it looked filled to him so I wasn’t in the mood to hold the drive thru up and destroy my zen so I just paid $2.03 for an extra small fry. Please train Michael.< /Review>

Do not pick up your order at the pick up window if you already selected drive through when using the mobile app. Car line was too long but I found parking - decided to pick up from the window. Guy in front of me, same issue, had someone pick up his paid order. My order some how got lost. No one there was trained or corporate never insisted on using the mobile order number as reference. They made up for it but only after both of us insisted the order be processed. Still good though 😋</Review>

This location is quite challenging to to the size, but they make it work. I would like to recommend that they put trash cans on the adjacent backstreet because a lot of people cannot park their car since the lot is so small so they eat on the side street and throw their trash on the curb 👎< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKNPQVusMiQbv7bkgbEXPxJ_Jy-SBLfJlq1U5T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2bf25b3b5582d:0x65495951d8cc5f63<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

the line is so confusing the security guard who's supposed to be securing The Joint don't tell you nothing he just watches you wait and wait and wait until somebody jumps in front of you and then you got to be like up no excuse me the line is behind me but in fact they're the ones in the true line it's just very confusing setup I mean I can't imagine being in a car trying to order through the drive-thru because the line is out the street it's terrible I mean the chicken is good but it ain't that good for all that<//Text>

I used to come here a lot and have no problems. Yet lately the service is absolutely terrible. I ordered 4 chicken strips (twice in two different occasions) and got 3. No one asked if I wanted any sauce or ketchup. I left with no straws in my bag. Just terrible. Why would I want to come here if my order is going to be screwed up, every time I come here.< /Text>

It is by no means Howlin' Ray quality or even any hot chicken, but if you want a good chicken sandwich with little-to-no wait, Chick-fil-A is where you should go. I had my order delivered through Postmates and it was here within 30 minutes nice and hot. I got their spiciest and it didn't have much kick, but it was a tasty piece of chicken nonetheless. Their fries were excellently seasoned and had a good crunch to them. Overall I would eat there again if I didn't have hours to spend waiting in line for those top-tier hot chicken restaurants.<//text>

It is very difficult to describe the magical events taking place in your mouth. It's a sandwich one can eat forever and be very satisfied with the simplistic menu selections for there's really no need to add anything because perfection is perfection. The Hollywood location does have a few issues, outdoor seating is not fully shaded and moving the metal chairs across the concrete floors can sound very loud, dramatically loud and unavoidable so be prepared. Service is fast and the ketchup packets are a must see.</Review><pics>None< /pics><user>100502370616087630944<//user><resp>None< /resp>< date>

<text>I ordered 3 chicken tenders, fries and a drink
Fries is barely crispy, has no salt at all and almost tasteless. Tenders are are very juice but the size is very small. Compare it to mcdonalds and you will see the difference.
The only thing that is outstanding here is chick fillet special honey  sauce. Its amazing
Service was very fast but I dont like the idea to sit outdoors and it, especially in winter time.
Overall 3/5</text>< pics>

Loved this Chick-fil-A! It was different,outdoor one. The service is great, just how you would expect a Chick-fil-A to be. They did mess up an order but they didn’t hesitate to fix it right on the spot with no problem. I enjoyed the food, just as how I know it back in Texas! Would definitely make another stop my next time in Los Angeles !<//text>

Bomb food 🐔🐓 and nice employees for the most part. Usually always a crazy long line at night and really busy during the day but at least they’re fast. 💨 They mess Up my order a lot of time too though but the food is always fresh, hot, and good. 😊<//text>

Pretty awesome, we ordered, paid the guy, who we placed the order with. While waiting in line, a nice rep came and dropped off the order to our car, before we even hit the checkout window. Seamless and easy, just the way i like it..</Text>

Kind staff as usual. Food was great. Outdoor seating only, on a main road so can be quite noisy and not in the greatest area but would revisit.< /Review>

It is ok
.I don't know what all the fuss is about regarding their Christian views. I enjoy their food. They seem very wholesome, and kind. It is very refreshing to see that these days. Very nice place to grab a quick  bite< /Text>

Talk about efficiency at this Chick-fil-A!  It was my first time here going through the drive-thru and it was awesome. I was in line on the street when I pulled up and I was mentally preparing myself to wait in line for at least 20 minutes. They took my order and I paid with the girl that took my order. Then before I even got to the pick up window like 2 minutes later a guy came out and brought the food to my car!

The spicy chicken sandwiches and the waffle fries are the go-to deliciousness.<//Review>

Lupita was excellent tonight, thank you for your positivity. While pulling up to drive thru I had no expectations but I was left with waiting for my waffle fries uplifted after my short but sincere interaction with Lupita who was very courteous and positive. I was already satisfied for coming to Chick-fil-A even before I got my fries as I'm typing this</review>

Just a word of advice. If anyone works here DON'T GET SICK!!! They definitely will hold that against you for something beyond your control and not give shift hours it seems. Very disappointed</text>

They're evil and their sandwiches are unhealthy. Be smart and avoid this ghastly mockery of modern civilization. With that said, my spicy chicken sandwich was delicious and helped ease my guilt. It wasn't enough though. My fries tasted like the concentrated tears of those less fortunate.</text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Chick-fil-A is pretty much a household name of stellar proportion and recognized as on the higher echelon of great food repurposed as high end fast food. This location and the chain as a whole are no exception. The traditional chicken sandwich is extremely delicious while the addition of the secret sauce only adds a layer of brilliant to extraordinary. The cashiers are always very friendly and readily accessible. The wait time is fairly modest considering they're in the heart of Hollywood. It's a great high end place with many selections, but the traditional chicken sandwich and chick sauce is more than enough wonderment for my stomach. Highly recommended.< /Review><username>Luke Daniel</username><gmapID>0x80c2bf25b3b5582d:0x65495951d8cc5f63<//gmapID><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< userid>

Tasty food at reasonable prices, and in a great location. The drive thru is so busy they have staff to take people's orders as they queue down the street. Might work out quicker to park and make the order at the main window yourself. Outside seating only.< /text>

<Text>They forgot my Chickfila sauce today. Also, I think this cookie may have been from yesterday's batch and it doesn't taste fresh :/ When I asked if they had any cookies they said let me see and then said "ummm yeah" after about 20 seconds. Usually in the morning they're soft and warm and this one just doesn't taste as fresh...<//Text>< pics>

Fastest fast food ever
Had the chicken strips, they were good, better then expected.  But the best is left turn easily to/from street access, faster then in n out.  And free drink card as it was my 1st time<//Review>

Not sure what happened to this location. I give them props for getting the line moving, but it seems like they can never get the orders right. The last three times I’ve been here, my order has been incorrect, missing something, or was more difficult than it should have been.

Today I ordered a deluxe with no pickle & pepper jack cheese. When I got the order, it was labeled as such, but it was actually a regular deluxe with American cheese.. at least they got the no pickle part correct.<//Review>

<review>One of the busiest Chick-fil-A's I've been to since it's in the heart of Hollywood. It's a drive thru or walk up window with tables outside only. The biggest issue is the seating area and the tables are pretty dirty. Even cleaning the table tops more frequently would help. But for how busy this location is, I'm always impressed by how quickly they can put orders out. And if you're a self-proclaimed Chick-fil-A addict like me, you should get the app and sign up for their rewards.</review>< gmap_id>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Typical Chic-Fil-A. Midsize parking lot,pretty quick drive thru even on very busy days. There are benches and seats that can accommodate about 40 people, in case you decide to enjoy your food there. Staff is always friendly and the wait time in never more than several minutes. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because of the smaller parking lot compared to other locations and the restrooms aren't in top shape.<//review>< Pictures>

Trapped in drive through line with my food and the driver ahead of me was too busy looking at her phone to move the line forward. Associates need to monitor the customers in their cars. Would be nice to make an extra lane to exit from those still waiting for their orders. Food was good quality and as ordered.<//Review>

The parking lot was full so we had to use the drive-thru. I was extremely impressed with the system they used to take all the orders, process payments, and provide each of the vehicles with their food!!  Amazing!!  We were on our way in less than half the time I expected, and our food was hot & fresh!!</review>

Chick-fil-A is Chick-fil-A (always delicious), but this location really needs to do something about the drive-thru/parking situation. It's the same entrance for both so it's almost impossible to park, and around meal times the line often spills out onto Sunset and McCadden is regularly completely blocked.<//text>

<time>1564400761474</time><Rate>2</Rate><text>Really disappointed by the lack of attention to detail during my visit to this particular Chick fil A today. I'm a frequent visitor here, and now I'm considering not returning.

Visited around 11:30 am, not busy at all, plenty of open tables. Basically what happened was that we were given the wrong order, so I let them know immediately. It wasn't a big deal. The server went up to the customer they had given our order to. The server let him know that he switched up the orders, and gave the customer one of the fries originally meant for my order. That also wasn't a big deal. He told me that he'd get me another order of fries and bring us our correct order.

However, the server FAILED to see that the customer had opened and used a ketchup packet and LEFT IT on our tray. A USED ketchup packet. Seriously?
To make things worse, the replacement order of fries were SO UNDERCOOKED that 1/3 of them were inedible. They were mushy and translucent, because the potatoes were barely cooked. I'm fine with a few undercooked fries here and there, it's a common mistake, and it has often occurred at this same chick fil a. At the VERY least, they could have made sure the fries were properly cooked. Instead, they rushed it, probably because he mixed up our orders.

I'm typically a forgiving and patient customer, but today the errors piled up and it was inexcusable. I hope they get their act together, and maybe put some more experienced employees on the morning shift.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

While I myself have never had a bad experience at Chic-fil-A — food has always been hot, fresh, and good; service has always been friendly, courteous, and efficient — their record as being so anti-LGBTQ-friendly irks me to the point that, until they change their ways, they will always get two points below what they would otherwise get.  That, and I won’t be patronizing their establishment as much as I otherwise would, so they’ll be getting fewer of my gay dollars with which to spread their  anti-gay message of hate and intolerance.< /Text>

Chick-fil-A or Popeyes????? Are you crazy???  Not even close.. CHICK-FIL-A for the 🏆 I order my lunch on the App when I leave my doctor’s appointment. I could eat this every day, I had breakfast and lunch the same day. I then came again the following day for lunch. Don’t forget to grab 1/2 a dozen freshly baked  🍪<//text>

But not a big deal what was a big deal is that they completely messed up my order this is my first time here but I'm pretty sure my milkshake is not supposed to taste like a lemonade. And when I come out to the counter and told him this they said no that's how our shakes are. I don't understand why people like extra carbs.

Got here with plenty of time for breakfast and they informed me they are already on lunch. Chick-fil-a does not understand how breakfast works yet. Just go to McDonalds.</review>

I've tried the sandwiches and they're ok, but the 2 starts are for the frosted lemonade drink. $5 for a too sweet half lemon half cream? something. Not sure. It tastes ok but after hearing it's so great etc... Such a let down.< /text>

Good chicken sandwiches. Parking might be an issue but for pedestrians the walk up windows create a nice atmosphere and rather fast service.< /text>

This place sucks. I normally love going to Chick-fil-A , but this place is always messing up. The first time I went and ordered a sandwich without pickles Togo and they gave me one with cheese and pickles on it. I drove 20 minutes to get a messed up order.I let it go and figured maybe they were just having an off day. The next time I went they forgot to give me one of the drinks I ordered, tried charging me $1 for sauces and they charged me for a chicken nugget meal when I ordered the free chicken nuggets from the app.NEVER COMING BACK AND TELLING EVERYONE I KNOW NOT TO COME BECAUSE THIS PLACE SUCKS. I have always loved Chick-fil-A, but this is just sad.<//text>

No where near as good as the ones downtown.

Fat black dude and Asian girl that man the register are rude. Milkshakes tastes weird and food tastes mediocre.

Never will go out of my way to go here again. I'll try to find parking downtown or drive to Firestone first.< /text>

I don't eat animal protein any longer, however when I did, chick-fil-a was always default when we wanted nuggets. The polynesian sauce is EVERYTHING.  And they have some of the best bbq dipping sauce out there. The seasonal Peach Milkshake is beyond good. Staff is always great.<//text>

I love the food they serve and the taste of the food. Chicken tasted great and also I will order chick-fil-A one day on my phone. Maybe Doordash or/and  Postmates does delivery to your house. And also a big line to order your food but it's ok. Recommend coming to try the Chicken.< /text>

First time ever dining at Chick-fil-A and they hit it out the ballpark. Home run.
The chicken was as good as people raved about, maybe even better. Job well done to the young men and women at Chick-fil-A.<//Text>

Perhaps the most busy outlet I have seen. Still you don’t wait long for your sandwich. If there are many cars in the drive through they will come to your car to take the order.<//Text>

<Text>I would rate this place with ZERO stars if it were an option.  The salad I ordered was far from healthy. To top it off my son’s chicken nuggets were super salty he couldn’t finish his meal. If you want to end up with high blood pressure this place is for you otherwise STAY AWAY!</Text><Time>1563754766024</Time></record>

All seating is outside, so it we were freezing. But in summer you might be hot. They had very good and fast service, including a nice staff. Good view of the road in front of you, and some of Sunset.</review>

first time here at this location, at about 2:20pm.  the parking was kind of hard. there was no spots.  the food was fresh and good.  they get 4 stars because of that loud speaker they have blasting music really loud.  otherwise it was great.< /review>

I LOVE Chick-fil-A, but this was the first place that had locked bathrooms with wads of toilet paper in piles in the corner.  The stench was unbearable!🤢🤢🤢🤮 Considering some of the homeless people around the area and the psychotic person who told my friend he was going to kill them, I would NOT recommend this area!🤬< /Review>

Their chicken tastes fresh and good, everyone knows that. But calling a sandwich "deluxe sandwich" just by adding a slice of cheese and lettuce to it and charging ~$1.50 extra—how does that even make any sense? I get that they have the best chicken among any fast food restaurants, but why is everything so overpriced?< /review>

<review>Hating on Chick-fil-A Is literally a sin (no pun intended with their religious affiliation). Fried chicken prepared a couple different ways. Always delicious always fresh. Deluxe chicken. Sandwich with either honey mustard or chick-fil-a sauce IS FINE DINING. Quality is amazing for the price. The way this drive through works is very efficient gets you out of there quickly. They do need to change the soda filter (do not drink that nasty tasting soda from places) but hey, maybe some of us need to also stop drinking soda. Plus, the waffle fries make up for any other inconsistencies I can think of. The employees are always smiling and cheerful, always ready to accommodate customers.</review>< Date>

<text>I am going to give three stars only because I love their food. The chicken sandwiches are simply superb. With this in mind though, my order has been taken by other customers numerous times and today when I ordered a #1 I was given some other meal that was not what I had ordered and did not notice until I had gotten back to my office.< /text>< Gmap_id>

If you want to wait in line for 20 minutes to get  disgusting "food" that tastes like it was made yesterday and sat on a heating tray until it's too stale to chew, then you should definitely come here. I usually love Chick-fil-A but this location is the worst.<//review>

<text>Everything always taste freshly made. The sauces are delicious, and they don't hassle you when you ask for extra. Outdoor seating is the only seating available. But with all the umbrellas around, the sun has never been an issue. Recommended for a quick bite in Hollywood.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<rate>4<//rate><review>On this visit, I had the deluxe sandwich combo and it was great!  The sandwich was a lot bigger than I thought it would be - I have huge hands, and it took both hands to handle.  Sometimes you can handle a sandwich with one hand, but not this one.  The waffle fries are OK, may need a bit more salt and to be a little more crunchy - but, that's to taste.  At this location, there is only outdoor seating.   Also, unlike other locations, they don't have sauces out for grabbing, instead, upon ordering you are asked which of their all so yummy sauces you want.< /review>< Pictures>

So disappointed. The company is supposed to be selling a superior product yet it is overpriced and oversold.   Not what Jesus would do, I don't think.  I don't think he'd have anything to do with them.  Pastor Kelly Stagg<//review>

Very unfriendly staff. It is listed as drive through only but there is actually an outdoor seating area which they don't keep clean at all and there are a lot of sketchy characters around.  Food is typical chick-fil-a, very good.< /review>

I never go to Chick-fil-A because I much rather keep some of my money.
They have good chicken though if you don't mind small pieces for all of your money.</Text>

Althought the drive through was crowded, they have an efficient system so the time spend is reasonable. Chicken soup too thick, though.< /Text>

Visited here while in Chick-fil-A, I thought I’d spoil myself with the tasting menu and I couldn’t fault it, to some it may look expensive but trust me for the quality of produce you receive it’s really not<//Review>

3/24/17: sandwich came with bread and chicken only--missing all condiments. Manager doesn't answer phone. Dozens of workers  running around and they can't get my order right 2x in a row. Not wasting my time attempting to reach the manager I'm just not coming back.

Gross, dirty seating area. Typical American fried fast food. My dad used to buy this when I was a kid. So out of nostalgia I thought I'd try it again. I guess the food is ok if you like fast and highly processed food. I don't. I can't see myself eating here again.< /text>

Besides the occasional weirdos cause it's Hollywood an who am I to talk I'm a weird 1 myself living in a strange weird world, but I can say the most often have pretty great customer service seems as if they care about the customers experience they properly prepare the food an normally deliver it to you with a smile..  I can't do full stars because it's still Hollywood & it can be crowded but it can be fun.. I go here often because I go to school for music near by that's the only reason I can give you this thorough response enjoy an let's #dobetter world..<//review>

If only parking were easier.  Of course, that's what everyone in LA wishes for everyday... Chick-fil-A cookies and cream shakes make the traffic and parking woes worth it.< /review>

Delicious chicken food. The employees were pretty friendly, and the prices were alright. The only minor inconvenience was that there was no indoor seating, only tables outside which is inconvenient when it's windy.< /text>

Friendly staff, delicious food, great prices - what's not to love? A bit of Southern charm in the middle of Hollywood, and surprisingly chill in the wake of a recent clash of cultures. If only the nation as a whole could come together this harmoniously.<//review>

<review>Food was good but had some kids pedalling for money ask us 3 times if we could help while we were eating. A man pulled up with a vulgar prop that he waved around at our kids and us. Only seating is out side along some busy streets. I have to say the service was great and the tables were cleaned well. Just the location isn't very safe.</review>< Pictures>

Chick-fil-a stands out above all the rest when it comes to their food and shakes. The food and service is a perfect 5 out of 5. However this particular location is a nightmare to get to and you'll spend about 30 mins in the drive through. It's not their fault just the location to blame.</text>

The food is great and tasty, not too greasy for fast food, and they offer healthier choices like unsweetened ice tea. There is an abundance of sauces to try and the waffle potato fries and fantastic - served hot too! The staff have been polite and the service is so efficient. I love it! Will drop by Chick-fil-A every time I visit LA!</text>

I love Chick-fil-A for alot of reasons, first off, their not on the stock market, they are Christian based that's probably why you wonder why their not open on Sunday.  It's remarkable for companies to really treat their employees like gold & it shows.... The nuggets are the best...< /review>< Rating>

Newbia had a nasty attitude. She was very unpleasant and did not seem thrilled to be at work at all. I visit chick fil a atleast twice a week for years now and I’ve never had a bad experience until today! This girl needs to learn people skills! If you don’t like you’re job then find a new one! No one forced you to come to work it was your choice! Just by having a smile on her face could have changed the entire situation</review>

It's always busy, but everyone is friendly. They always get my order right. They lose one star because they're not open on Sunday, the one day I want it the most 😂, and because the line is horrendous. It's not the location's fault though. Also, it's in Hollywood, which is gross and scary.< /Text>

No complaints at all about the food, it's always consistently good. My one complaint though that's keeping this from a 5-star review is that they consistently mess up giving you sauces. Ask for sauce and you won't get it, or get just 1 when you ask for two, etc. (Consistently, drive-thru only)</review>

The drive through is a pain in the ass.  They have people outside trying to manage it, but people will try and cut in line from the opposite direction of Sunset.  It makes it more irritating than it needs to be.  They'll bring you your food if you're next or second to next depending on your order.  So getting out of there is easy.< /text>

I don't get it. Quality and freshness are ok.
It just doesn't taste particularly good. The flagship grill was most disappointing, the fried was a bit better. McDonald's which is nothing to write home about actually tastes better.<//Review>

Not as clean and fresh looking as it once was but still a decent place to grab a quick chicken burger and fries.  Staff are friendly and the service is usually fast!  On the rare occasion where something has been screwed up or delayed the move quickly to put it right and take care of you!< /text>

Waffles fries are also good, but not when they come out cold.  Don't think the chicken is as good as everyone says, it's only slightly better than McDonalds.< /Review>< pics>

I have loved Chick-fil-A since the first time I had it in Memphis. I was so glad when it came out here. Now I can have it all the time. I particularly like the one on Highland and Sunset. Good service.<//text>

If you're looking for Chick fil A, this is your spot. The food is excellent but you don't get that warm fuzzy feeling when you order, not any fault of CFA, it's the area plus there's no dining room. The restrooms are very clean for the area so that's a great thing. 4 stars because there's no dining area and 2 drive thrus. I spend a lot of time in my vehicle and wanted a new environment.</text>

The tables are dirty and the floor has sticky spills, bathroom is not very pleasant, really don’t like out door places cuz it’s too public where anyone could really just come and chill or even smokers passing by and not very safe for an area that’s very packed which could have a high rate of an accident where you aren’t safe because your outside, they should have both indoor and outdoor, also not very good for when the weather, it’s very cold and they don’t have any fireplaces like most of the places I’ve been, there food tastes raw, tends to mess up food orders, and I can’t even throw away my trash because their trash cans are all full.  Really don’t recommend even coming here.<//text>

Long lines @ lunch time.  Sandwiches not as plump & good as they were. I've had to lower my lower my expectations, the bigger it gets. And they put ONE PICKLE.

Months later: Much better.<//Review>

The Chicken is simply exceptional. Might not be the best chicken I have tried, but for a quick bite, I'd say it's a strong contender in the chicken game!</review>

Busy but quick service. Only offers outdoor seating. Most tables had umbrellas and the weather is usually great for that.</Review>

<Review>Great food and service! Outdoor seating only. They do have parking and drive thru, clean restrooms (need code to get in). They have mist-ers blowing so it cools you off when it's hot out.

I understand it's an extremely busy place and there are alot of customers constantly stopping by, but the staff there especially the young lady taking my order by drive through was extremely rude. As if that wasn't enough I drive up to the Window, another rude young lady ?? Jesus.. if the job is too stressful then im sorry to say but FIND ANOTHER JOB. Employees like this make businesses look like they will just hire anyone for the sake of political correctness.<//review>

Initially the cashier is very friendly and my food was served quicker rhat expected, even faster than a woman that ordered before me. My order spicy chicked deluxe sandwhich was flavored pretty well and a lady even offered to throw away my empty bag and refilled my drink. Overall a good experience for my first time being here.</text>

< Review>
Though there is almost ALWAYS a line at Chick-fil-a, it's because their food is so good  AND their help is so courteous, respectful & friendly.  ....besides that, their special-flavor milkshakes have always been "over-the-top good"!

Parking at or near this Hollywood location is not always simple, but their higher-capacity drive-thru set-up helps take away the stress of that issue.< /Review>

<Text>Expect a huge line during dinnertime on Fridays. There are people making both left and right turns into the entrance causing a lot of traffic on the narrow street. The problem is that the 2 drive thru lanes merge into 1 lane. I will say that the line moves quickly despite the bottlneck. The service is incredible though, from beginning to the end and let's face it... It's Chick-fil-A. Who doesn't want good chicken sandwich?< /Text>< pics>

Very busy location but the employees get through orders quickly. Parking will most likely be a struggle, try parking by the bank parallel to the restaurant.<//Review>

I come here specifically for the fries. Wow, they are delicious. I have tried waffle fries this way from carls jr but they do not compare at all to these. I love that they are not too greasy and they have the perfect amount of crunch and salt. I have tried the chicken nuggets which were also good but these fries are really what keeps me coming back. Love it!</text>

The worst location I have ever been. Horrible serving. Fries that I got was full of broken pieces, they only covered the top with normal ones. Chicken burger had only two slices of pickles, which covered only half of the bread. DO NOT EAT HERE. Go to other location.</review>

<Review>Forget all the ridiculous politics that come up any time someone mentions this chain here in California. If where you eat is how you express your politics, then what are you doing eating at any fast food chain? Anyway, great chicken sandwich, and a lot better than KFC.< /Review></record>

The owners maybe homophobic, religious zealots.. But they make damn good chicken!  Everything tastes so frickin' good here!
I recommend the (Polynesian sauce, and chick fil' A sauce) for whatever your getting.</text>

Great place! Aside from the food being good (as usual), the staff is pretty chill an nice. This Chick fil a is always my go to! I’m not surprised this place is always usually packed. I think every chain of Chick fil a’s are just like that. Prices are good, and food is always fresh. My fav choices are the #2 Meal with a Splenda lemonade. Never goes wrong.<//review>

<Review>No bathrooms, always filthy, the seating is grimy and unpleasant and the food is not as "good" as other locations.  All that being said, they handle the lengthy drive thru lines well and still provide decent customer service...BUT ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE PULLING AWAY FROM WINDOW!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The food here is quite delicious, however the service was sloppy and they messed up some things. I would highly recommend the spicy meal with a milkshake. The sauces are a MUST.</Review>

But I researched this place and learned that the manager does a lot of work with anti-bullying groups, including ones that specifically help LGBTQ+ kids. I figure that, and CFA's decrease in giving to hate groups, evens things out and I can enjoy a damn chicken sandwich without funding radicals.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< pics>

Very hard to get into the drive-thru and the lines are always really long. The food has always been prepared correctly and the staff is friendly and attentive. I love the grilled options. It's not dry bland grilled chicken. It's moist and delicious, packed with flavor. The regular or spicy sandwich is SO GOOD, you don't need any condiment. Yeah, I said it... Nothing.

It's perfect as is. My only gripe is access. Parking to sit and eat is a pain because the drive-thru traffic blocks the only IN driveway. Wish this was in a better location. So be warned if you're starving this might not be the quick fix you need. If you have time to wait, it's pretty damn good.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

You already know what to expect, so I won't spend too much time talking about the food. My go to usually consists of 2 spicy chicken sandwiches, a large fries, a milkshake, & 3-4 Chick Fil A sauce packets. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The best part is how consistent the food is. It's never lost its quality in all the times I've been there.

The staff & management is very friendly & responsive. This branch has a lot of deals & giveaways. Perfect for the college budget.

There's generally plenty of ample seating, but if can be kind of tight. There's parking at the Lorenzo.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Worst location I've ever been to. No indoor seating, only outdoor. Chicken fingers were old. Grilled wrap was old and not filled or wrapled well. They got my order wrong and had to go through a hassle. Someone else next to me yelling at the manager cuz there was a hair in their food. No one said "my pleasure". Just a completely different culture of Chickfila than I've experienced across the country. Plenty of other places to eat around here< /text>

As all chicfila it's super delicious. The only gripe I have about the place is traffic when the busy hours come around. The drive thru is organized and managed well but the volume of people can make it a hassle to get in and out. Still though this place is gooooood.</Text>

Many people swear by Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwiches but I do not see why. They are Okay but sort of just average as far as I am concerned. I can think of several other fast food places (who don't specialize in chicken) that have better chicken sandwiches.  There is only outdoor seating at this location and they also have a very busy drive thru that often extends its line out onto the side street you enter the drive thru from. Also keep in mind that this location sits caddy corner from a High School which means that the line to order your food during the weekday lunch rush can be very long.<//text>

No parking, virtually inaccessible for dine in. Parking lot was full of spaced out people hanging out, talking outside their cars. Employees were totally fine with their parking lot being used by non-customers.</text>

<Text>One of the smaller Chick-Fil-A locations--this was a "carl's jr., Jr' before i believe. The quality is consistent with all the other chick-fil-a locations--that is, awesome chicken sandwich with 2 slices of pickles, waffle fries, old fashioned lemonade, and ice dream. Between this and the in-n-out down the street, your fast food options in Hollywood are covered.</Text></record>

<Review>Oh, Chick-Fil-A...You are such a wonderful, family friendly organization!  I have been a satisfied customer for years living in various parts of the US.  I lived in Florida and can still remember that humid wind blowing in my face as rolled through the drive-thru waiting for that delicious hot meal.  I have recently journeyed out to California where I now reside and couldn't wait to get my hands on some Chick-Fil-A!

However, along that journey something went astray. More specifically; on the night of August 21st, 2013 at the corner of Highland Avenue, and Sunset Boulevard...

...Now I'm not referring to the meal itself. That spicy chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and a fresh squeezed lemonade was still as intoxicating as it always has been. What I am talking about; is the service. I was traveling with a friend, a female friend....as god intended me to....

...so naturally I doubled my order, bringing our meals to a whopping $16 and some odd cents (we all know about that California Sales Tax).  I believe I speak for every Chick-Fil-A customer when I say that I would greatly appreciate 100% of the food I ordered, rather than 83.333% leaving me one spicy chicken sandwich shy of my desired order!

Now forgive me if I came off a little strong in that last statement, I'm just hungry.  I just thought you would like to know because lets me honest, a good business is consistent, but a great business is always improving.

God Bless!<//Review>< user_id>

It's a chick-fil-a, in Los Angeles. Great food, especially the spicy chicken breakfast burrito. Customer service exceeds expectations, as most Chik-fil-as do.< /text>

<text>Chick-fil-A Rocks!!!  Ever since I was a teen going to the mall back in Jersey, I recall this joint offering great quality fast food!  Amazing how it is still considered fast food even though the taste and quality are outrageously Good!!  Their sandwiches are always tasty and tender, perfectly seasoned and they have the Best Criss-cut Fries Ever!! I Love Chick-fil-A from NJ and now in LA. Here in LA we have extremely low-grade fast food, except for In N Out & Five Guys and they only make burgers really.  The others all suck.  Chick-fil-A is the Best (not greasy) Fast Food restaurant in the USA!!< /text>< Date>

Usually fast, food is usually consistent and quickly made and the staff are very courteous. It's near Hollywood so the drive and parking there are gonna suck.< /Text>

<text>Line moves quickly but Sunset gets really busy and loud so not the best setting to enjoy your food.

It's chick-fil-a so still the best chicken sandwich of the fast food chain variety.</text>< pics>

< review>
The spicy chicken sandwich is the way to go. Their honey mustard is very tasty and sometimes I mix it with there polynesian sauce: tangy, sweet, sour... you've reached Flavortown (as G.F. would say). Sometimes I will order an extra grilled chicken breast, slide it over my fried chicken breast, and then you have one mondo sandwich. Great for a post-workout and not terribly unhealthy.

Here's another tip, pass on the ice cream. Looks great, but tastes like ice-vegetable stock. However, while you're not eating ice cream, help yourself to a chocolate chip cookie. They are uniquely delicious with a little touch of an oatmeal-chocolate chip flavor. This chick fil-a is particularly well run. Everyone has always been very nice and accommodating at this location. My favorite midnight snack.<//review>

<Name>Kendra Cooke</Name><text>I have lived all over the US. Originally eating this food on the east coast. I was soo happy they moved to cali. Since I'm a cali native. I always love chik Fila. However at this location I received molded food. No lie my tomatoes were molded and fuzzy
I was already home. So I wasted money, And they are not cheap

Which is just rude since I paid to...what eat rotten food? Heck NO

Very upset and as a addict for over 15 years I know I am not going to return again.
Come on chik Fila your better than crap employees messing up your food

Where is the quality control?

Feed people like you wanna eat, Right?

Do you want molded food and have to pay out the whazoo?

So disgusted by how in the world can you make that for someone and give them that as a paying customer!!

Obviously I molded them with my jedi powers and wanted to throw out a $12 meal

You'd have to be blind to not see the green and black tomatoes are not normal. They didn't CARE.. .... WHY??

I work in food always have always will
Somethings you see are not to be forgotten as people working are sometimes lazy and don't care how much you pay to get sick<//text>< Time>

I gave it 4 stars not cuz of the food but cuz the workers don't have the right motivation to serve me my chicken sandwich with a smile. They didn't say hi dammit lol and cuz the chicken is a little but over salted.</Review>

I went and only had three heart attacks today, which believe me is a good day, but I did notice that the advertisements seemed oddly racially influenced as well as all around deceiving. This was much like the disappointment of taco bell, as they did not have "Moma's cookin", but overall not a bad experience.< /text>

It was clean in the seating area outside the only thing about that location is heavy traffic not enough parking and there are alot of homeless people in that area ( during the day 10:15 am ) at night it's not a safe area.</text>

(Translated by Google) It's so delicious that I want to bring back a lot of sauce that comes with potatoes.
Chicken burger is delicious with firm meat, but the punch for the sauce may be a bit short. I want to put in mayonnaise.

(Original)
ポテトについてくるソースがたくさん持って帰りたいくらいめちゃくちゃ美味しいです。
チキンバーガーは肉がしっかりしていて美味しいけど、ソースのパンチが少し足りないかも。マヨネーズとか入れたくなります。</Review>

(Translated by Google) I remember that day: on a rainy noon, it was quite cool and I was walking with my wife down Sunset Boulevard towards the Guitar Center. We were a little hungry and momentarily it wasn't raining or it was just drizzling, so we stopped to buy something to eat at Chick-Fil-A. Without knowing the place we ordered some chicken nuggets and another menu of chicken stripes. Ri-qui-si-mo !. The chicken was really delicious. The attention was also quick and good, I remember that an employee came over and dried our table and chairs so that we could sit down without having to ask, very attentive.

(Original)
Recuerdo ese dia: un mediodía de lluvia, estaba bastante fresco y caminaba junto a mi esposa por Sunset Boulevard rumbo al Guitar Center. Teníamos algo de hambre y momentaneamente no estaba lloviendo o solo lloviznaba, asi que paramos a comprar algo para comer en Chick-Fil-A. Sin conocer el lugar pedimos unos nuggets de pollo y otro menú de stripes de pollo. Ri-qui-si-mo!. La verdad el pollo estaba delicioso. La atención también rápida y buena, recuerdo que una empleada se acercó y nos secó la mesa y las sillas  para poder sentarnos sin que tuviéramos que pedirselo, muy atentos.< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A different concept, but when you listen to more fried chicken, it's like more of the same, but chick fil-A is the exception.
