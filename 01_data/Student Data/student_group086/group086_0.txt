<pics>None</pics><review>Called ahead of time to make sure they had a certain size and brand of tire and they confirmed they did over the phone. Drove almost an hour to get there and finding out they didn’t have the tire they said they had. Had to wait over an hour and half for them to bring the tire from their other location here in Modesto after they said it would only take about 10-15 minutes. Will that was a lie!< /review><time>1616874240257< /time>< userid>

< review>
I took my car there couple years ago for repairing flat tire. When they brought my car back I saw damage on my rear bumper.
When I complain about it, they said that I have to call them back because they need to check the cameras. But when I called them they said they couldn’t see anything in video. They also refused to show me the video. I saw my car when they took it and I was 100 percent sure that they did it, but they were lying to me.<//review>

<review>I have been getting tires for years. Until now no issues. They do not honor their warranty. I bought 4 cooper tires got rotation every 5k miles and got alignment  at location. Still would not honor it. I do not recommend this place. I would stay away, I made the mistake of buying several tires from this location. Tires are less than a year old, highway miles on it. AVOID if possible.<//review>< pics>

I believe honesty that they deserve 0 stars. I went there around 4:10 today may 24th 2020 and they said they’re close when clearly is says 5. What kind of business is this where they can’t stick with their words. If it say you close at 5 why are you closed at 4:10. Then he lied to me saying the doors where closed when clearly several doors where open.</Review>

<text>I bought rims from the Manteca location and I went to their Modesto tire shop for a tire rotation. I was greeted very fast and I asked if they could check out a shake I had in the steering wheel. They found out the problem was my brakes gave me a great price and fixed them right away. I always get excellent customer service thats friendly, fast & easy from this tire and rim company. Best part is that they have numerous locations in Modesto, Manteca, Tracy and elswhere throught the central valley so they are never too far away. I think they are the BEST TIRE AND RIM SHOP IN MODESTO AND MANTECA!!

Honestly bad service! When I asked questions they were never answered on top of that rude customer service! When I went i felt like they push me to the side and to top it off when my car was ready they didn’t even call me a different costo we came up to me and told me my car was ready and that they were calling me but I didn’t hear them calling me and I was sitting like 7 steps away from the front area! Never going there again! If you want good service you’re deffinetly not going to find it here!.</review>

They did the chamber kit front and back on my 2008 Dodge charger R/T and I'm very satisfied and happy with the price other were charging almost $2000 and I had to wait almost 4 to 5 days for parts and work amigos tire pros did it for little bit more then half the price and had my car done and ready in 2 days there very helpful and understanding of any situation also have 2 different types of payment plans make you feel like family I highly recommend them</Text>

We understand you phoned the shop nearing the end of the business day. Although we were approaching the end of our day we provided you with multiple options: towing your vehicle to the shop so we can assist and stay open late, or checking with a friend/family member to see if they would assist with the socket and lug nuts. It is difficult for us to provide action when the vehicle is not at or near the shop. We take customer feedback very seriously and work hard to provide all with a 5-star experience. We are sad to see that you believe we fell short. We hope to have the opportunity to show you what it is that has made us into the successful and professional business we are now, in the future.'}<//response>
<user_id>108696214091516800000</user_id><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Should have read reviews before shopping here.. Everything was great and it slowly started to go down hill First my estimated delivery for my rims was not the one given i had to wait longer than what told. Second i had asked them to hold my old rims and tires and they did when i went to pick them up about 2 weeks later they had missplaced them they couldn't find them. 3rd the new rims i bought i had asked them to put locks on them but never received the key. Unfortunally i had a flat tire today and called them to ask for a suggestion since i couldn't remove the lugs well the person that answered the phone was very rude to come by the next bussiness day and he would find one for me. Not even the original key he was just going to give me any one. Well i explained that i had a flat tire and was stranded and asked for advice.He said i should tow my car i said "i am sorry sir you expect me to tow my car because you didn't give me a key to my lugs" he said "well you'r asking for an option" and at this time he had already raised his voice at me. I said well yeah because you are suppose to be the proffesional he answered well you can get a socket and try to removed them. Well here i am trying to find the socket and remove the lugs for 3 hours and not to mention stranded out of town with my kids. After trying so hard i had to drive my car damaging my rims to a close by Auto part store only for them to tell me that i was about the 4th person that they had done this too because that auto part store does the delivery for their parts and that they don't give out the lug keys to the customer... I am very very dissapointed with this place rude customer service if they would have done the job correctly and have gaven me my key to my lugs i wouldn't have had to move my car with a flat tire and getting my rim damaged it wouldn't of taken me 4 hrs to figure it out and get home... I usually never write reviews because i hate them but my self that works with customers all day and as a store manager i can say there is no communication between co workers no organization what so ever and really poor management. Really dissapointed in the service they offer first and last time i will ever purchase from them.<//text>< time>

Avoid this place!!! Horrible service!! Was supposed to pick up truck on Thursday but had to wait at shop on Saturday to finally get it! They didn’t get to install the grill even after the truck was kept there from Wednesday-Saturday afternoon. Also found a dent on the door of our brand new truck that was not there when we dropped it off! Take your money elsewhere!< /Text>

< Review>
Awful experience. Will never bring our vehicles to get serviced here ever again. If you have a nice vehicle I would not, I will repeat WOULD NOT recommend you to bring them here. The drivers DO NOT know how to park vehicles. They drove my nice car and smashed my bumper against the curb and cracked my bumper in 4 different areas. Luis was very unprofessional with the situation. Made me feel as if I was in the wrong. Did not want to take full responsibility for damage that was done. Driver admitted to driving vehicle against curb and Luis still had the nerve to say it wouldn't do that much damage to my bumper. Very unprofessional to treat a customer the way he did. DO NOT BRING YOUR NICE VEHICLES TO LOS AMIGOS. Luis was very unprofessional.   I'm a very unsatisfied customer.<//Review>

This is the worst place for tires or mechanical they tell you a price and then after the work they tell you another price way higher afterwards. I do not recommend this place and they get mad because you tell them that they don't keep their word and feel offended other places have better services and cheaper prices valen pura verga</text>

(Translated by Google) These people do not respect the guarantees of the tires, they leave you with a Chinese story, not to pay, or that they will give you a great discount of 5 percent, because it does not cover the warranty. Bla bla bla. I do not recommend this place.

Esta gente no respeta las garantías de las llantas, te salen con un cuento chino, para no pagar, o que te van a dar un gran descuento del 5 por ciento, porque no cubre la garantía. Bla bla bla. No recomiendo este lugar.< /review>

First time we went, the food was good. Service was ok. Second time we went,  food wasnt ok, and most of the staff wasnt. The server was the only good part. I think my pastrami was a few weeks past the enjoy by date.
Third time...forget it. I got brisket sliders, and they were completely hard rubbery fat. There was one piece of "brisket" that was so hard and gristled I had to spit it out. It's gotten dirtier each time ive been.
Flat beer, uncaring staff, and food has gotten progressively worse.<//review>

Friendly staff, good music from the digital Jukebox. I ordered the club sandwich and was delighted to see thick cuts of meat that look like they came off of a slicer on the thick setting. Veggies were nice and crisp, and the bacon was very crunchy and nice. The bread is  buttered and toasted. This is a nice sized sandwich and I am pleased.  I recommend that you come give the place a try. Good beer selection as well.< /Review>

<Text>Well I don't know how to start, my wife and I both ordered the New Yorker platters which consists of a New York steak two sides and a salad, the salads were really good the steaks on the other hand not so good, more than half of the steaks were fat and they put absolutely no seasoning on the steaks whatsoever this is the first time I've used a steak sauce on a steak in years just to try to give it some type of flavor, it was not cooked to order and I would never recommend this to anybody. I had also ordered the shrimp with my dinner and they were cold although they had good flavor. The drinks are tiny, We will never go back I would not recommend this place to anybody.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The service is great the food is even better it's all homemade so it takes awhile to get yours your food but let me tell you it is well worth the wait the drinks are on point they're not water down I give this restaurant a five star review.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Today was our first time at hidden tavern. We thought the food was very good. It was nice and clean. I  was disappointed that at 12:30 they only  served breakfast not lunch. And the cook with the ear plugs and tattoos was drinking at the bar in between orders. But it was very good service and family friendly. We will be back.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Pretty cool little dive bar. $20 all you can drink Friday. Don't know if this is a normal thing but we'll worth it. 25 beers on tap. Fair selection (5 or 6) of bottle beer. Great atmosphere helpful staff. Dead until about 11:30 hen it filled up pretty quick. We DID NOT eat.</Review></record>

My place at the bar on opening night was staked out  by my boyfriend with the help of the GRACIOUS EXCELLENT STAFF. The familial atmosphere is nothing but a wonderful addition to the Oak Hills - Hesperia locale. They have truly some of the best food and grog with attitude in the High Desert. Please do yourself a favor and check out the HIDDEN TAVERN asap.< /Text>

We feel for the staff and owners but after witnessing dirty tables and a fellow disappointed customer along with our extended wait for service it's apparent that Hidden Tavern doesn't have what it takes to meet even 1 star.
As a family we remain optimistic that this local establishment can make core and significant improvements that will lead to their success.<//review>

< review>
The Server was very nice, however the adults were servered about 5 minutes before our son. How long does it take to make Mac & Cheese??  The whipped cream on my son's dessert tasted like it was straight out of a generic brand whipped cream can.
The BBQ sauce was horrible and the ribs and steak were not good quality meat.
They were really over priced for the quality or lack there of.
We we're anxious to try this place but the interior is exactly like the former place. They used super low end table ware (plastic plates & really cheap silverware) and regrettably the food was not really good. Our  son liked his Mac & Cheese but short of that we were sadly very disappointed.
Not trying to offend anyone, just being honest. Sorry 😣

*****Next morning update: food poisoning for 2 out of 3 of us.  Ugh! 🤢<//review>

For a place that has been open a mere few weeks it was fabulous. We had salmon and ribs, both cooked just right. Our server Puna was exceptional. We will be repeat customers and will spread the word.< /text>

<Text>This is a really great hidden Jewel across from the Super Target in Hesperia. The sports memorabilia and decor and TVs are just amazing .I asked for something healthy today and Gabrielle help me create an awesome protein Burger with tomatoes and cucumbers. When three other people ordered the same thing after they saw mine I told her she had to name it after me and guess what she said she would it will be on the menu soon. Come to the hidden Tavern and have a Donna Burger!<//Text><user>115115001377189736075<//user>< pictures>

This restaurant is AMAZING. This is honestly the best restaurant in the victorvill area. There food is good all out. There staff was very nice and they had excellent service. The food came out fast and I was able to enjoy my food.I loved that there was complementary homemade playdoe at the entrance. This is a nice change instead of crayons and paper for the kids. I highly recommend eating her.</review>

Horrible service horrible food horrible environment. Went with the family to have dinner, food was terrible and the service was awful. The macaroni and cheese the kids ordered was worse than box macaroni from the grocery store. The pork shop that we ordered was so overcooked it was inedible.  And apparently our server said the manager or owner was at the bar drinking.  There were only two or three customers in the entire place and they didn't even bother to come check on the tables or even come and apologize for the horrible food that we had been served.  I would definitely not recommend this place except to recommend that you avoid it at all costs.</text>

<Review>The waitress was nice but drinks were awful! Karaoke was a good thing. Its  Big place that has potential to be alot better if they actually opened up the rest of the place and made it just a bar/saloon.  All in all it was an  awkward atmosphere and sadly we wont be coming back or recommending this place.< /Review>< UserId.>

Our first and last time coming here, waitress was nice but the food is horrible. For the price you pay for a patty melt might as well just go to McDonalds. The bread was not toasted, the meat patty was just a hamburger and did not shape the rye bread so pretty much just got extra bread, and literally got one grilled onion ring. Money not well spent, ($10.50) serving food like that I'm sure this place will not be in business very much longer. We were the only people there as well so I guess that speaks for itself.<//Text>

<Text>Poor service. Went into the bar area and ordered food plus drinks. Received our drinks but was never brought our food. After waiting for an hour we told the waitress to cancel our order, she left and we placed a $20 on the table. We walked out got in the car and the owner flagged us down making me stop saying we didn't pay for our drinks. We simply told him we paid but he wouldnt let us leave. DO NOT go to this restaurant!! They dont know anything about customer service. My husband went back in and was told our order barley put in after an hour of us waiting from when our order was taken. That place was empty was we got there so order should have gone in immediately.</Text><Time>1501901831450< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c3686a005923d7:0x3078b59cd13c2beb</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Long wait for food. Then not what was ordered. Hamburger bun was so dryed out it would crumble when picked up. Nachos were ok. Daughters meal had a hot pepper in the middle.</text>

We waited almost an hour for our food and there was only about 15 people in the whole place. When the food did come out 2 out of 4 orders where wrong. The food was blandb but the pastrami was the best thing that was ordered. We will try it again and hope that it is better.< /Review>

Tried to give this place a shot but it was epic fail. Cold food wings seemed like they were made hours before pastrami was disgusting. I will not be back. Beer was warm and service was extremely slow. This place will not last if tbey dont change things up. Way over priced for there quality of food. Big disappointment<//Review>

This place looked nice, but the food and service were awful. Although the server was friendly she was totally unavailable.  It took 25 minutes for her to come back and take our order. It took over an hour to get our food and when we did it was awful. I got the bbq chicken sliders, which hardly had any chicken on them at all(and what was on them was overcooked), so it was mostly just a plate of rolls and pub chips, half of which were overcooked and the other half were raw inside. My friend got the chicken tenders which were also dry and overcooked, but the breading on them was gross, it was full of flecks of burned breading and stuff from other things like they don't change out the fryer oil. We couldn't find our waitress to complain and we're starving by the time the food finally came so we just ate as much as we could stomach. Then we sat there for another 20 minutes or so waiting for the check, we never saw our waitress again, I had to go up to the bar and ask the bartender to print out the check for us. After dinner we were still hungry so we grabbed fast food on the way home.</text>

<Text>Walked in, waited several minutes for waitress to notice that there was anyone there despite there only being 2 tables being served in the entire restaurant. When we went to order, they were out of the three entreés that my boyfriend attempted to order. Once he finally asked for something that they had, the waitress came back and told us that they were out of that too. We were a little annoyed and instead of being understanding gave us very apparent attitude as if it were our fault. The side salads we got were subpar and it took them 45 minutes to bring us our sandwiches, which were missing the sides of fries. We asked about it and the waitress seemed very irritated. Servings are super small, especially considering the prices, and my sandwich is so soggy I can't even pick it up.  TL;DR overall just don't come here, really annoyed with service and quality of food.</Text>< Gmap_id>

The food is very good. The chef Freedom, has a love of food, and the soups made that day are awesome ( french onion, vegy beef, etc...). Fish and chips had a huge portion of fish moist and tender. The cook made the tarter for us and delivered it to the table as he says "with love". Great service and well lit unlike the othelr dingy sports bars in the area we have been to. We are here for 3 weeks from out of town, and have been looking for a place like this.  Many tv's to watch sporting events. Whatever the sporting event, you can watch it here.  Watch out for other reviews put out by other local bars trying to discourage you for coming here. Try it once and make a decsion for yourself.< /Review>

The server was ok but definitely IN A HURRY!!!! He was the only one out here, currently there are 7 tables full of people and ONE server.

With that being said, I found something in my drink and he hasnt been back since he brought out my greasy mozzarella bites (which aren't too bad besides the fact being full of dripping grease)

I got a peach "frozen" margarita because they have no drink menu for me to choose a nice drink from so I went with what he recommended. It was good while frozen but as I kept drinking it tasted like pure alcohol and ended up finding something in my drink.

This place has potential.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

If you're a fan of bad service rude waitresses and a incompetent manager be sure to visit this location if you actually want to get a beer and get food go to the gas station and get your beer then go to In and Out it'll be a better experience that's what we had to do< /text>

I even asked he guy who gave me the sandwiches if he added it and he told me yes! During this time that a lot of restaurants are trying to survive solely on takeout and delivery, you would think they would try to get things  right. They need to hire some more competent people at this location. It's not very likely that I'll be ordering from here anymore or using their app. Hope this review helps..<//text>< pics>

We always order from this jersey mikes never no problems until today 5/16/20.. very upset 😡 with Dustin . He answered the phone put me on hold, and when I say on hold he put me on the counter. I can hear everything in the background.. so for 20 minutes I was left there... then they hung the phone up..  hopefully they will teach Dustin how to properly handle phone calls. With the covid-19 how are we supposed to call when you have a person not taking phone calls.< /review>

Sandwiches are great! Had the roast beef with provolone. One employee wasn't wearing a protective mask and the other one was. Baffled at this I wondered what their policy is during COVID19.  Seems that employees are supposed to wear protective masks, and this guy wasn't. Someone needs to be put in check for the safety of customers as well as  employees.< /text>

<review>Jersey Mike’s has not disappointed me yet. The bread is always fresh when I go. Their online service is awesome. The sandwiches are off the chain good. My favorite is not on the menu cakes the Cali club which means yes Avocado! The best and you have to get it Mike’s way!Just the fact that they slice the meat in front of you is so cool!<//review><response>{'time': 1547763875720, 'text': "Greg- Thanks for the awesome review!

Stopped here for a sandwich for dinner, after a long day at work. I just walked out, disgusted by the dirty countertops and messy condiments, with drippings all around the trays. Not to mention the loaf of bread that is just sitting on the counter, in a corner, waiting for the next unsuspecting customer! Yuck! What ever happened to Proper Food Handling Practices? If that is being done where customers can see, what is it that we're NOT seeing? I don't expect to return to this location.</text>

<Review>First time at this location , never been interested in jersey mikes but after my experience today I’m definitely coming back. I was taken care of by Desiree. She has the most welcoming smile and aura, she made me feel right at home. She was patient with me (being a first timer) and even suggested some subs I might like. She’s amazing!</Review>< Pics>

The slower service and lack of attention at times make it a time to test the patience of hungry customers standing in line.< /Review><userid>111539976065842523281<//userid></record>

Love the pleasant, welcoming team and atmosphere here!  It's set up cozy and much more spacious than other businesses in this packing house complex.  The two young ladies were so sweet and helpful this morning after 9 am.
This is my 1st time trying JM's for breakfast; so glad I did.  I ordered the breakfast egg & cheese sandwich with my choice of roast beef on a warmed, rosemary cheese bread.  It was very fresh & truly delicious.  I shared my experience w/my co-workers after whom assured me that everyone here is very kind.
Breakfast starts at 7 and ends at 10:30 am.  I was told that the coffee is really good here too "bold, but smooth".  That'll be my next try with one of those tasty looking sweet treats I saw.
Thank you Jersey Mikes for adding breakfast to your menu👌🏽❤🤗</text>

Friday evening on the way to Redlands Bowl two employees working.  Even kept cleaning as they worked with phone ringing in background probably with DASH orders. Employees thanked us for waiting, food was great Mr or Ms owner you really should have more help on a Friday evening. Two employees tonight should get 10 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /Text>

As I walk in, I always get greeted with a smile, especially from Desiree and Michelle. The place always looking clean and fresh. Its wonderful having you right next door to our office, convenient, and I get to beat the lunch rush. I highly recommend coming to this location. Thank you girls for making my sandwich as perfect and delish!< /Review>

The staff at this Jersey Mike’s is phenomenal.. Desiree was so patients and helpful with my family and I. Her knowledge of the subs was great and a few tips to spice it up the way I like was so on point. I’ll be referring people for sure. Thank you for putting together a staff that has great people skills.<//Text>

<Review>I am just getting around to posting this but, it has to be said. This Jersey Mike's leaves a lot to be desired. What a huge disappointment! I received the worst customer experience of my life here. A particular female employee (think her name is 'jayna') was ineffective and rude. This employee should be fired immediately. I dont wish bad on people but this is just not the job for her. If management cares about their business and their customers I think I they should more than consider it. Unbelievable!</Review><rating>1< /rating><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1545090324042, 'text': 'We are so sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant visit at our shop!

Me and my wife went to this jersey mikes this afternoon for the first time . Immediately when we entered we were greeted and treated by three of the most  funnest ,friendly and awesome workers we’ve ever met. The girls made an awesome sandwich for us(pastrami) and it seriously was the best pastrami sandwich I’ve ever had. It’s very rare nowadays to have this kind of service in a fast food type restaurant. We were literally happier when we left there.

De’Janea,elander and miah thank you guys!! Keep making people smile(it’s contagious)<//Text>

<review>Food is pretty good. Recommend the whole rotisserie chicken. Tastes great even the day after! Crunchy potatoe tacos & pretty large wet burritos. Fries are good as well. Tacos de al pastor & asada were a bit dry & potato salad needs a bit more seasoning. The employees treat you well. All-in-all, a small location but pretty good food! Try it out.</review>< UserId.>

Wish we lived closer so we could eat here more often. Delicious food! The chicken quesadilla was one of the best I’ve had, the meat is prepared well and satisfying. Definite must have. We also had carne asada fries, and the asada was just as well cooked as the chicken. And the portions are more than generous. Kudos to their chefs!</review>

< Review>
I have been going to Southridge Dental for many many years more than 10 years and I am super pleased . They are very friendly, professional and hospitable . They know me and my family by our names and they are always so kind and understanding of our dental needs. They even know how to work with my son who has autism. They are kind and patient with him . I love that they have Saturday appointments that accommodate our busy schedules. I recommend this  place 100%< /Review>

The dentist was a very good communicator.  Explained exactly what was going on with my teeth including clear pictures.  The new photo technology used in the office is very powerful and gives me as a patient so much insight into what the dentist needs to fix.  I appreciate that this office is always personable and remembers my family.  Going to the dentist is not something I look forward to, but Southridge Dental makes it as painless as possible.  They always accommodate my schedule, never make me wait, and no surprise charges.<//Review>

<review>I am so afraid of the dentist, which is why I've been putting it off. I have cracked tooth and was in so much pain I couldnt take it anymore. The staff was amazing got me in asap and was so kind and attentive! The Dentist was so comforting. I was not afraid at all. He started my work and I literally felt nothing after the first numbing shot. He told me everything he was doing and made sure I was pain free the entire time. Great Dr. and great staff!  Thank you all!<//review>< user_name>

I’ve been going to Southridge dental for over a decade. They always take great care of me, communication is great, and they make sure I’m as comfortable as possible. I was so scared to have a root canal and they did a great job of numbing me. I didn’t have any pain and they did a great job of explaining everything me to ease me fears. They always have the latest technology so X-rays are super fast and most important, all three of my boys do not fear going to the dentist. We started taking them when they were toddlers and Southridge dental was great about establishing a good relationship with the boys and not doing anything past the boys comfort level, Showing them the tools and explaining what they would be doing. My boys have had cavities filled recently and have never cried or resisted going to the dentist. I highly recommend Southridge Dental to all my friends and family.< /Text>

I had 4 wisdom tooth taken out on the same day and my experience was the best I had so far by far of any other dentist I have gone to.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THESE GUYS.

For my follow up they treated me with respect and well what can I say, nothing but the best from the front office to the dentist personal.  Very professional!!!<//Text>

Excellent dental service. I have been a patient of this Dental office since the latter 1980's, and have always been treated with excellent care. I have never had a problem with my bill being inflated as some other Dental offices has done in the past.
I have seen the Hygienist Quinn for approximately 20 years and she is the best Hygienist I have ever had in the past. She's knowledgeable and fun. My family also decided to go to this Dental office because of the excellent care they give me.</review>

I would consider myself a very judicious consumer.  During these dark times of Covid, I was so cautious and fearful of seeing a dentist, but I was so impressed with the safety protocols of this office.  The dentist and his staff were so caring and professional, they eased my fears.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.< /text>

<review>Well it started with the two bad experiences with Western Dental. Horrible customer service! For a deep cleaning they wanted to charge me almost $900. I asked for a regular cleaning that was provided and they said NO! So goodbye Western, your dead to me.
Hello, Southridge Dental. They are awesome. I was looking for this friendly, smiles, back to basics customer service. Everyone I interacted with was super nice and welcoming. Over explaining, which I love. And always asking if your okay. That’s important. The dental hygienist is super nice and just a great professional with 20 years experience. She gave me very minimal pain, if any at all. Thank you. And this whole delightful experience only cost me $258. Awesome deal! So thank you Southridge Dental. You have a new regular customer.< /review>< Rate>

Had to get my teeth cleaned my dry mouth was wreaking havoc and with they stay in place my sugar intake has been out of this world. Felt safe and they took all of the safety precautions. As usual did a great job</text>

<review>We recently moved to the area and was looking for a dentist. We are so happy to have found Southridge Dental Group. The dental office is clean, warm and inviting. The staff at the front desk is friendly and ready to assist you. The hygienist, Quynh is wonderful and so gentle. She is very thorough with her cleaning and makes sure your teeth are sparkling clean! Last but not least, Dr. Hilton is so friendly and welcomed us to the office. He was thorough with his explanations and is just a very nice gentleman and dentist. Our family is so happy to call Southridge Dental Group our new dental office! Thank you.< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Nobody likes going to the dentist! Our initial visit was because they were close to work and home. From the moment you walk in, you just feel comfortable. Thirty years later, we are still going to Southridge Dental. My youngest daughter drives from Los Angeles for her appointments. We wouldn't consider going any where else. The staff is like family and you feel that from your very first appointment. The facilities are clean, very ultra modern equipment, and all procedures are done with a "gentle-dental" hand.

<Review>I was looking for a dentist that is honest, clean and not over price.  Love my hygienist she takes her time to deep clean my teeth.😀
I like to book my cleaning with the same person but this time they booked me with someone else, I was kind of frustrated :( but at the end they fit me inn with my regular girl.< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) They are very professional, very considerate understanding and patient in treating patients. Because really I was very scared thinking that the treatment I needed was going to hurt a lot, but it never hurt at all, they never hurt me and my treatment was long and difficult. All the staff are super super friendly. Thank you Gina, Thank you Alex for being so patient and understanding. Because really one as patients needs people like you. God always sell them. It was a very nice experience. And thanks also to all the staff they are all very nice.

(Original)
Son muy profesionales, muy considerados comprensivos y pacientes para tratar a los pacientes. Porque realmente yo fui con mucho miedo pensando que me iba a doler mucho el tratamiento que necesitaba, pero nunca me dolio para nada, nunca me lastimaron y mi tratamiento fue largo y difícil. Todo el personal son super super amables. Gracias Gina, Gracias Alex por ser tan pacientes y comprensivas. Porque realmente uno como pacientes necesita gente como ustedes. Dios las vendiga siempre. Fue una experiencia muy agradable. Y gracias también a todo el personal todas son muy agradables.<//review>

Based on a recommendation from my coworker, my husband brought our SUV in to get brakes done at Pep Boys on Rosedale. There was a lot of corrosion of the brake components and the service tech provided our options as well as his recommendation. He took the time to discuss the corrosion that he saw and to understand why it was like that. Because our vehicle is from a colder climate, that amount of corrosion made sense. He changed out all of the bad components and did so at a cost less than any other quote from shops I had contacted. The guy that at the shop was named Shaun - he was awesome! Thanks Pep Boys! Highly recommended!< /review>

Needed some new tires pretty bad, and it was the 4th of July.  Luckily they were open (special hours) bit of a wait BUT the little waiting area had nice chairs, free WiFi, big screen TV drinks if I wanted them. They also use the water fountain where you can refill water bottles. I've only seen them in Los Angeles and this is the first one I've seen in Bakersfield. Great service and they were pretty quick.  I would recommend.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3mq5pM4-RmeC3hdtLUDyOeb1xbICAQf6mLUKt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOcIvchsdgryQChAiYx1VzJMwXK5inwHflLpWx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIbBdLdzWV1MMnPQFBzaGEtwQqnkT-03thrSI7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqyxr3L5iCvtqqoGjesFtKOjpZyEQ7WMJ8dLVP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgV735iur7mFcEO1UctSo_Ewa2jNIY_K7ZY90W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>{'time': 1530753755819, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5 star rating!

Raul at the Rosedale location told me it would be over $400 for something that was completely unrelated to the check engine light. I brought it somewhere else and it was only the gas cap. Raul charged me $100 just to hook the scanner up to it and tell me what was wrong with it. I drove away feeling the most ripped off I’ve ever been in my life. Essentially I’ve been robbed by pep boys.. I’m filing a complaint with corporate.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1610757982624, 'text': 'We appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback and apologize for your frustrating experience.

<text>Two cars I had both ended up with the skid plate falling off while driving after they serviced my car. This last time, they broke my air filter box, my car has two filters and one filter was found to be different, and put in wrong and they broke the clip on the box, so thats hundreds of dollars for me to replace. I was lied to about it, I asked if my filters were checked and ok, they said yes. Of course they would say yes, they broke it. I learned the hard way, pay cheap prices at a place with high turnover rate of constant new employees, you get what you pay for. Not worth going back.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

While they were able to get us in for the day I couldn't help but feel ripped off. Not only was their quote higher than a normal quote, the final price afterwards was higher without explanation. I had no choice this day so I had to take it. The folks seemed nice otherwise.< /text>

I ordered tires through Amazon that were shipped to and installed by Pep Boys. Appointment was conveniently made on-line and the mounting was done timely and professionally. They did a great job and I would highly recommend them.<//Text>

I scheduled an appointment online for an oil change.
Walked in no waiting, they promised an hour to complete it and it was done in one hour. I forgot my coupon but they still honored it and give me the discounted price.< /Text>

This place has become my go to place for miso of my vehicle issues , tires, replace pressure sensor.  Probably my next oil change instead of jiffy lube.  My only complaint would be lack of bathroom last time.  As a senior bathroom is VERY important.<//text>

<review>Brought a old 2001 Mustang in to fix the AC. It worked when we picked it up but not great. But that's because it's OLD.  So I didn't want to spend more money on it. But Shaun  had a great customer service attitude. We will be bringing it and other vehicles back there when needed, because of Shaun's professionalism. Good job Shaun!<//review><Date>1534166246604< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Joey and Steve were very helpful. My car required an unusual repair (bad bushings) and the technician (Nathaniel) did a great job fixing it, and did so at a fair price. My car now rides much more smoothly! Contrary to what I thought, Pep Boys actually has competitive prices, especially if you check their website for sales/promotions. Highly recommended.<//Text>

<Text>Great place to take your car for any issues!! I took my Yukon for some service!! The person who assisted me was great!! I believe his name is Rudy, I told him he had some great skills that other shops didn't have. I work in a field where customer service is really important and Rudy met all my spectations!! Fast service and great customer service. I would not go to any other locations!! Keep it up</Text>< date>

I brought in my older bmw for some new tires and services about 2 weeks ago. I was greeted in a very friendly matter as soon as I walked in to the store. Everything was done very fast!! The mechanic Jack and the manager Rudy were friendly and answered all the questions I had. I would definitely recommend this shop, thank you.< /text>

I went there to get my tire fixed the mechanic went to bring it around back and stopped and started honking at a truck backing out instead of backing up to let the truck go he just sat there honking. My car was hit. They stated they would take it to the back to check the damage. After they were finished they stated there was only a small gap wrong with it and it was barely noticeable so I said I'm okay with that. But no they lied. My left blinker doesn't work and there is a piece broken inside where the light is. So I called and told them there were more things wrong with it then they stated. The assistant manager told me they don't check for bodily damage. How is that when they told me they would check to see what's wrong with it and then lie to me about it. And it was there fault! If they would have taking responsibility for there actions and been straight up and honest or at least said no problem just bring it in and we will fix it for ya I would have giving a good rating but nope. Worst service I have ever received. I just bought my car.</text>

<text>Came here at 4 PM for an oil change. First they tell me I'll have to wait until 7. Then some other rude cashier bumps and says oh there's five cars ahead so we can't do it today. Really? Dude it doesn't take an hour a car. More like ten minutes a car. They seem to have more employees than customers. First and last time at Pep Boys. Valvolene down the street is way better. Avoid at all costs.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Went in to do an oil change yesterday. I came in with a coupon on my phone. The employee ( Raul ) said he'll scan it when I checkout and to disregard the "regular" price quote on the paper he showed me. Once checkout came, he sneakily put in another, more expensive offer (SKU)  instead of the one I I was supposed to get. After some back and forth, he finally agreed to give me the price HE SAID I was going to get in the beginning. This is why I am very wary of these kind of places. BEWARE PEOPLE!  I will also make a formal complaint to corporate.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1555062910788, 'text': 'We apologize that you had a poor experience.

<text>What a Joke this Pep Boys is... I could right a book about how poor  of a shop this is.
This is the last straw.
So I got a flat today. I changed the tire and took the flat to Pep Boys I was told they could not help me because they are out of Plugs to fix the tire. You are a tire shop that what you do. you fix tires. go to the store and buy some plus or patches  at the auto parts store you could walk to the CARQUEST.
I think they hire the stupidest people I would be surprised if they can tie their shoes.
If your reading this and you go to Pep boys off Rosedale HWY you truly like to gamble.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1401472698116, 'text': 'We regret to hear about your experience at one of our stores and would like to know more about your visit.

They do not top off oil if you had it changed there.

I found this info out from a mechanic in the back. He was very condescending to me. Sarcastically Told me that I could buy oil and put it in myself or they could do it.

I asked to speak to a manager and was told they were in the front of the store. They cannot come to the back???????

I drove to the front to talk  to management in the store about his mechanics poor customer service. He told me that they are mechanics and do not have to deal with customers. Very poor response sir.

Anyways, went to Testers Mobil on Coffee rd and they took care of me. No questions asked. Looks like I found a business that cares about their customers.<//text>

I had potentially a very difficult day that was transformed into a most pleasant experience.

I was on a family road trip and my car engine started knocking in Buttonwillow, CA.  The closest civilization: Bakersfield.  I drove the vehicle as far as I could and had it towed the rest of the way to the only shop I could find with my crappy cell service that was open on a Saturday evening and within the stupid 7 mile limit of basic AAA (that will be another review).

We drop off the car I go in, and say, "Help."  And help they did!  Not the car, mind you.  It was beyond the pale.  I was told it was probably an internal engine problem that would require a rebuild and that they could not do it until after the weekend.  Frankly, it wasn't worth doing.

Ugly problem?  Got worse.  Since I was 800 miles from my destination I had to find a car to rent to get the six of us home or a hotel so I could find one tomorrow.  The search was becoming fruitless.  "We are all full."  "We can't accommodate that many."  "We have no rental cars of that size, maybe tomorrow?"  What was I do?

Well the staff did everything they could.  They called rental agencies, they looked up hotels for me, one extremely kind employee offered to clock out and take us to a rental car agency.

Short story (too late?).  I found a hotel, got a car the next day and headed home.  Abandoning my dead car in their parking lot, promising to get rid of it.  Only to find out none of the salvage yards I called wanted it, even for free!  Some even refused to call me back (more reviews).  I kept the folks here updated and eventually donated it to Habitat for Humanity.

So a review that has little to do with auto service?  Yes, indeed.   As someone from out of town who could offer them nothing but the cost of my diagnostic, they went far above and beyond.  You have every reason to expect kind and courteous service from these folks.  If you are tired of dishonest mechanics who seem to care only for how much they can get out of you, I recommend using this shop.  And if you are the boss reading this, give these guys a raise, or whatever it takes to hold on to them.  They are gold!< /Text>

Had an appointment at 11am and showed up at 330pm and my car was still parked where I left it, hadn't even been touched. When I asked the employees what happened I got conflicting answers.</Text>

<review>How can you go wrong with See's?  You walk in and are immediately offered a free sample of some delicious candy.  Find a box of mixed nuts and chews, or Soft center truffles, or toffee, or .. ok you get the idea.  Not the cheapest candy in town, but it puts the box candy from the drug store to shame.</review><GmapID>0x808fcb46e41fcf8b:0xc2f4a9b1f701228d<//GmapID><username>Jeff Kinnicutt</username>< Time>

I've been going to this same See's Candies location since I was a kid. Still nostalgic about the black and white checkered floor and the awesome uniforms. See's Candies chocolates are the BEST !!!!! Anything creme-filled is the way to go!< /text>

The store itself is standard and staff is friendly. But the location is sketchy with some shady characters about. I felt the need to double-check that I locked my car and hold my precious chocolates close as I walked back to it.</Text>

<text>After going to this See's Candies, I will never purchase See's from a mall again.  Because it is a stand alone store, there is not as much foot traffic.  The employees were able to spend a lot more time with me filling up my box.  I was also provided several pieces of chocolate to sample.  The store is also much larger and far less crowded than the ones inside a mall.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This is my go-to See's store. The staff are friendly, helpful and patient. Any silly question asked, gets a knowledgable answer. This location also serves as the warehouse hub for the area, so the wide variety of candy and specialty boxes are ALWAYS in stock. If nothing else, go here for the generous samples!<//Review>

Full selection of See's and not too long of waits as they seem to staff it pretty well, even for Valentines day crowds. Also, they are very generous with the samples.</Review>

Sawl Law group is very experienced and professional, thanks a lot to Mr. Martin Taleisnik he works very hard with due diligence and prioritizes his clients best interests above all.
I strongly recommend Sawl Law group is the best.
In my case he negotiated a pre plea deal i took a course and the case is dismissed. I am very pleased with the results. K A.< /Review>

They were wonderful during this difficult time. The corina was amazing, with her response time to phone calls and emails. I could tell she was invested in case and made every effort to get the best possible outcome. Everything was explain well and clear, I did not struggle to understand what was going on, nor did I ever feel as though I didn’t know what was going on. I very much appreciate all that they did. I would recommend them to others.<//Review>

The group at SLG worked diligently explained every situation in detail to me and answered all of my questions. I had the pleasure of dealing with Martin Taleisnik who, from the very start, was upfront and realistic regarding the situation and expectations. In the end my case had a great outcome, for which I am very grateful. I was very fortunate to fall into the care of the Sawl Law Group, and I would recommend them to anyone in need of a law firm to handle a Criminal Defense & Personal Injury case.<//review>

Just wanted to thank the Sawl Law group for a job well done. Corina did a great job and was very helpful. Corina explained the procedure in great detail. She always kept me well informed and always made herself available to me via phone, email and in person. I would highly recommend the Sawl Law group to family and friends if they were ever in need of their services.

Thanks again for all your help and hard work!</text>

<Text>Sawl  Law Group was such a big help to me. I would definitely recommend anyone who needs a lawyer to them. I currently live in a different state and was unable to appear in court. Sawl Law Group stood in on my behalf. I was so grateful. In the end my warrant was recalled, and I was able to complete the stipulations of my case in my current state. This was such a relief to  me. My fee was very affordable, and I was able to be put on a payment arrangement. I couldn't of asked for better service. My person of contact was Claudia, and she was very helpful, and informative. She answered all my questions, always contacted me back when a message was left, and was always available for me. She walked me through the whole process and I  appreciate her support. I just want to thank my lawyer Michelle for working on my behalf and Sawl Law Group for helping me out when I most needed it.  So if your searching for a good lawyer who would work on your behalf, please choose Sawl Law Group.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

This Law Firm is great! From the time I was referred to them, meeting Bobbi the receptionist to my attorney Corina B. I was in great hands. Every time i needed them they went above and beyond the call of duty. At first I was thinking am i getting billed for all of this extra stuff? But nope they are just nice, professional, nice people. They made me and my family feel protected. At the end of my case we got more money after all medical & attorney bills were  paid. It wasn’t about they money but, it helps. Thank you Sawl Law Group.</review>

<Review>Working with Saw Law Group was a very positive experience, that truly left me satisfied with their service that was given to me. I have never been in an auto accident where I had to seek help of an attorney. When my case was presented to the office they were very thorough with explaining what was to be expected, how long the process could take for an offer to be finalized. Though it took sometime to receive my settlement, I was always kept in the loop of what was going on with my case. If I had any questions or concerns regarding my case all I had to do was call, and ask. The front staff was very friendly, as well as informative, and I highly recommend any one who is involved in an auto accident to give this office a call for assistance, you will not be disappointed. Saw Law Group is definitely always on your side.
Thank You Saw Law Group< /Review>< Resp>

I retained the office to help me with some very serious charges that would hurt my career and long time goals. I was wrongfully accused of taking materials from a job site. I did not take them, this law office help prove my innocence.  They helped me find an investigator for my case. The staff was always ready to help me and willing to go the extra step when I had questions. The Attorney later was able to get my case dismissed.  I will forever be grateful to this office who helped me. I recommend Sawl Law Group if you want someone fighting for you.<//review>

She also explains everything to you so you understand what's going on. I strongly recommend her to anyone in need of her services, and would not hesitate to call upon her again. Thanks Corina!

I just wanted to say a few things about Sawl Law Group. I had never needed to hire an attorney  before, so I didn't know what I was doing, or what to expect. When i had just been charged with a DUI; I had a pile of law offices to choose from. The first one that stood out was Sawl Law Group. They were very professional, and welcoming. Claudia made a long drive, just to meet with me face to face, and  have a short conversation about my case, and my options. She made me feel confident that I could do much better than I had hoped. Claudia paired me up with  Michelle, the attorney that would then, represent me. She took care of all my court dates (after signing a document of course.) which was especially helpful with my crazy work schedule. Not only that, but they were able to lower my DUI to a much lesser charge of "Wet Reckless" saving me thousands of dollars, and time. So thank you Sawl Law Group, Claudia, and MIchelle. And to anyone else who finds themselves in a bind; I definitely reccomend starting here!< /Review>

This was the first time I had ever been involved in any situation like this. I had spoken with a few lawyers before heading to Sawl Law Group. The previous lawyers did not meet my expectations with their professionalism, concern or attentiveness.  Sawl Law Group was very welcoming and understanding. They took immediate ownership of the problem at hand. This problem had wrecked havoc on my life by draining my time and my finances. Sawl Law Group was affordable and handled the case so I wasn't required to miss work and physically be present. I would highly recommend Sawl Law Group to friends, family and anyone who needs a tough lawyer to receive justice.<//review>

We have been dealing with Martin Taleisnik of SAWL Law Group on a matter that was very personal for us. It was an occurrence that happened whilst we were visiting Fresno which left us with a pending court case.
All during our communications with Martin we found him not only to be compassionate to our case but very informative and reassuring as to the advice he gave us. In difficult times you need this comfort from those who are genuinely trying their best for you which helps to reduce the stress and anxiety that builds up during the court process.
Without Martin helping us in our time of need, continually updating us and giving us his expert advice we really dont know where this would have gone.
We would not hesitate in recommending SAWL Law Group based upon the legal, caring and genuine help we received from them< /Review>

< Review>
Our Experience with the Sawl Law Group was only positive.  My adult son was in serious trouble and refused to follow our extended family's advice on how to plea, so as to enable him to get the help we thought he needed.  Martin Taleisnik represented us and went above and beyond his call-to-duty in repeatedly meeting with our son and trying to talk sense into him.  Because of his familiarity with the D.A.'s and judges, he was able to counsel us as to what to expect and whom to avoid, if possible.

All we were concerned about was that my son would get a fair hearing and not be swept aside by the court process.  During one court appearance, Mr. Taleisnik was in the judge's chambers for over 20 minutes, presenting the mitigating factors in my son's case.  At the sentencing hearing, he gave an impassioned speech to the judge which persuaded the judge to give him probation.  During that speech, a female sitting behind us in court tapped us on the shoulder and told us that she was impressed by our attorney.

Regarding the fee.  We were quoted a reasonable global fee that would cover anything that would transpire, short of a trial.  My son's case was continued almost monthly for 6 months, due to his co-defendant and other court procedures.  Mr. Taleisnik was always there, on time, and would speak to us afterward in the hall, at length, about what the proceedings meant and what the next step was.

I highly recommend Martin Taleisnik to anyone needing legal representation and would seek him out again,  if needed.< /Review>

I ordered a butter chicken extra large pizza through door dash...not only was it amazing, but the size of it...literally had to turn the box sideways to get through my front door. Will definitely order again!</Text>

To be honest I used to come here a lot but with time the quality of food has been getting worse and worse. If you look through my profile I don’t write many bad reviews so it takes a really bad experience for me to go out of my way to  discredit a business. This place has terrible food and even worse customer service especially the owner.<//review>

Never order shahi paneer and naans there.I ordered both of them.And they were pathetically bad.Shahi Paneer gravy was super watery and spicy. Naan are so thick that they were difficult to chew.But on the other end samosas and chole bhature are tasty.The owner should really consider in improving shahi paneer and naan as they are common dishes for vegetarians to eat.< /Text>

<Review>I don’t if the owner of this restaurant is Indian or not. Because they don’t know how to make Indian food. Taste less food, not even properly cook. Change your cook or shut down the restaurant. And for your info I’m Indian. I know original taste of Indian food.<//Review>< user_id>

<Text>Love the biryani here. Especially the chicken biryani. They really spend a lot of time making sure that their food is perfect. I asked them to make it a little less spicy for my kids, and they were super nice about it. The food is always fresh, and they make it quickly. When I came up to pick up the food, I saw that they had taken a lot of safety precautions. The cashier was very welcoming as well. Consider me a permanent customer. I would recommend it to everyone.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I tried a couple of Indian restaurants before, but the food wasn’t my favorite. While I was passing by the area, I saw this restaurant and decided to try it. The food was so good. I ordered some tandoori chicken, and some chicken pakora and it was the best thing I’ve ever tasted!! You will definitely see me again!!!< /Review>< Rate>

This restaurant don’t even deserve one star. They don’t know how to make Indian food. Yesterday my sister ordered for me chicken pasanda curry, paneer tikka masala curry with garlic Nd butter naans. Chicken pasanda curry was just dry chicken with onions, no tomatoes, no gravy. Nd paneer tikka masala is only paneer pieces no onions, no tomatoes,  no gravy. Naans was hard. Yesterday was my sister’s birthday and this food spoil our mood. I throw this food into trash 😡😡< /Text>

I was there aprox 10yrs ago & had the same experience, like all the bad reviews, with the guy that runs the place, I was really desperate & needed a new backpack even if used; paid aprox $70-80 for it, will never go back, unless life & death emergency, & that's a maybe; "The-Supply-Seargent" is a 5star, compared to this place...</text>

You have to call the owner of the store to see when he is going to open ,and when he does give a time he is always 20-30 minutes late from the time he gives.  Really horrible business practices.<//Review>< username>

<Text>I needed a pair of coyote brown cargo pants for my offroading trip and it so happened to be that there is an Army surplus store right here in San Fernando. This store is a gem and it's fully stocked with supplies, clothing, footwear, headwear, etc. I met the owner who provided me with excellent customer service and is overall a genuinely nice guy. He even gave me a good deal on the pants!< /Text>< user_id>

My experience was horrible. You can find much cheaper gear online. I admit this was my fault for not looking sooner but after purchasing a Name Tape from them, I realize my mistake. I needed it 2 weeks ago and the guy who helped me told me it would be here on time FOR SURE. I'm still waiting for it and requested a refund and they are refusing to give it to me because "it's not their fault." Horrible seevice, if something is promised and not given on time, then there should be a refund policy.<//text>

<Text>Walked in and was instantly assisted. I was looking for work boots while my son was looking for camouflage clothing. We ended buying way more than we walked in for because of the outstanding prices. Great selection, a hidden treasure in the heart of San Fernando.</Text>< pictures>

The owner is so disrespectful. He told my friend and I not to move things around if we weren't buying anything, and when we asked for the prices, he told us not to worry about it unless we were buying it. Then how in the hell could we decide if we're going to buy ir if we dont know rhe proce, hes a fu$king idiot. How do u run a buisness if u dont let ur customers see, try on, or know the prices.<//review>

If you ever need any army/military gear, this is where you should go. When I walked in, the store was almost overflowing with apareal. The owner was extremely helpful and really friendly. We drove all the way from Simi Valley and I am very happy with my purchase. We'll definitely be back soon!</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>My experience with Big Daddys Army Surplus store was terrible.   I looked at the reviews posted here and since my experience here I now believe that the reviews are made up.  They all hit on 2 or 3 things which like "the owner is great, you can find everything you need".  The reason I believe these are made up is because the same points that they say are exactly what the store is lacking.  The owner was rude, there are no prices on the majority of items, there is barely any room to walk around the store, the hours of operation were not followed (I had to call the store an hour after the store was supposed to be open" and the owner said he would be there in ten minutes.  I went to a few other nearby stores to wait and the stores all chuckled a bit and said he always opens late.  25 minutes later he opened up.  I had to ask for the price on every item because they were not posted which he very obviously tailors the price based on his belief of how much one could pay.

For example, I was wearing a tie and coat and when I asked him the price of a used Molle 2 assault pack he told me $160.  First of all you can buy a new one for less than that
Also, I have been shopping for those for a while and didn't need one but wanted to see how his prices match up with the rest of reputable businesses.  When he told me the price I said "are you serious?" Then he said "yes, why?".  I then told him that you can buy used molle 2 assault packs online for $32.  I know all because of my prior shopping.  These were from actual businesses not private people selling just one or two.  I asked him about other items and their prices and they were all extremely over priced.  I left and will never return.

As a side note, I do reviews on Google to help people.  I have never written a bad review.  But this store genuinely deserves a negative  review.  If you still decide to shop there do so at your own risk.  If you do go I suggest bringing your smartphone and after asking for the price of an item look it up on Amazon or another online resource to compare prices.  Make sure you check because if you don't you will be scammed and taken advantage of.  Best of luck if you decide to go in.< /Review>< pictures>

<user_name>Fatima Flores< /user_name><review>Took our son for his birthday because he loves cheeseburgers. First time going, the service was quick even when busy and they constantly asked anyone if they had been helped. They allowed me to grab the tip jar so my son could put in our tip since he wanted to and it was hisbirthday. Burgers were yummy and extremely filling. The fries were the best though our boys loved them. We'll be going back for sure. Extremely affordable as well.< /review></record>

<Text>Grabbed a quick treat with the kids. Cool little place, was a little afraid when pulling up due to the Saturday afternoon lunch crowd, but the staff here had all the food out super fast. It looks like the cook everything to order so what a surprise when the wait was nothing at all to worry about. All the staff appeared to be super friendly and the restaurant was clean and inviting. Definitely will return.< /Text>< resp>

Foster's simply has the best value in burgers in my area. Best burgers, always fresh ingredients, and friendly staff. Can't say enough good things. It's the kind of place that you get a craving for when you move away, and nobody will ever be able to match it.<//Text>

<review>Great burgers, chicken strips, and very generous helping of fries! This was the perfect spot after a long hike. Fast service and reasonable prices. Would recommend, we live in North County but will be back. My only suggestion for them is to switch to Coke products instead of Pepsi, ick. 😁</review>< pictures>

I am 61 years old. I lived in San Diego as a child until I left home at the age of 18 years old. I was so glad that Foster Freeze is still in business. I grew up with Foster Freeze and Foster Freeze was always my place to go when I was younger. As always the food is wonderful.< /text>

I am so disappointed in the quality and OVER-PRICING of CHOCOLATE "flavored" products of this entire chain now (I mean almost SEVEN DOLLARS for a large chocolate shake? Really?). If you don't mind paying an INFLATED PRICE for things that have NO CHOCOLATE FLAVOR TO THEM, then this place is par for the course. But as someone who GREW UP ON FOSTER'S in the Imperial Valley, I am BEYOND DISAPPOINTED that the quality of it's milkshakes and dipped cones is WORSE THEN DQ's!< /review>

I love this place Company and have been going to different one's since I was a child. I don't believe that I will be coming back to any Foster Freeze's because I'm not comfortable with the fact that NONE of the workers wear gloves when they're making your food, cutting different products, etc.. I live in the Mission Gorge area so I come to this one because it's close and I've seen it before and nobody puts on gloves even when the customers have to ask them. No mask as well while we're having this horrible virus going around killing people<//text>

OMG an OG site!  I couldn't believe my eyes. Time warped me back to childhood and good family memories.  My FF was torn down decades ago.  Now found this gem will be back.  Don't ever change!  Love the vintage ads and pics on wall.  Small hometown goodness!< /Review>

A soft-serve cone on a summer night is delightful. Fosters Freeze has the best chocolate-vanilla twist cones around. The medium is a generous serving and wants to be eaten in the car with the windows down. Classic.</review>

This establishment says it doesn't close until 10PM. I wanted to order a quick deep fried food. FRIES AND REFRIED BURRITO (not sure on menu number). I get to the window at 9:24 asked for it and was told they stopped serving food. I asked what did the first two people before me order. He dated ice cream. I walk back to my  car and as Im walking back to the car a lady stops and said I got here at 9:10 and they already stopped serving. If your closing down early state that on your site,  so people that drive from another area don't waste gas.</review><Gmap_id>0x80d955d8cc5e47e1:0x86ee099c82f02b2e<//Gmap_id></record>

Third time in last month I’ve gone with my kids to get ice cream and I’ve had to wait about 3-5 min (which is normal here and I’m ok with that part) and a later customer walks up and gets service from an employee before me.  Today, I waited 5 mins before the cook told me that someone would be with me soon and then a guy barely walks up to a pick-up window and a girl takes his order right away.  I’m like WTH?!  No more, I’m done with this place for a long while until they train their staff to be more efficient and orderly.<//Text>

Great old school place to get some classic food and ice cream. Not too many places like this still open. Used to have one near my house but that was many years ago. It's nice that some things never change.<//Text>

I live out if state now....but visit frequently to check on my dad. ...who still lives in the same house I grew up in...and.15 minutes away from the foster freeze.
As teenagers we would always end up at the "freeze" for I've ice cream, burgers, shakes...after the Friday nite games...it was always busy and the place to be.
Present day....its still does a good business...FRI's/sat nights a line of people and family's enjoying a dipped cone etc....and everyone is happy and smiling..
How can you not smile when ice cream is involved.
Every time I'm there it brings back memories of my youth...simple good times, good eats.
A definite landmark for Allied Gardens and surrounding area< /Text>

I can't comment on the food as I have never eaten anything from their menu but their shakes and malts are absolutely fabulous. I make the 5-mile trip to this location every couple of weeks just to get a handmade malt. There are lots of places closer that I could get a shake but none of them are as good as Foster's Freeze.<//Text>

<Review>wouldn't really ever eat their food here cause I have never seen them use gloves when handling  the food  for the last 10 year going here like everyday but if you looking for ice cream this is definitely the spot but all around good vibes besides that.</Review><user_name>Dank Flyer< /user_name><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

It's okay, $22 for cheeseburgers, fries, and a couple of twisters. Why is the ice cream yellow?</review>

I'm not from San Diego, but I grew up in a town that had a fosters freeze. Just like at home, this place hits the spot for good ice cream and it's a nice way to feel like I'm back  in my home town for a bit without a 8 hour drive<//review>

I've been going to this location for more than 40 years. Even when I don't go for a few years and returned, the food is just the same. Excellent.< /Text>

Good eats, burgers and fries. Ice cream is delish. Plenty parking, pleasant staff. Clean facilities, air conditioned, roomy seating area. You can order inside or at the windows. Chocolate dipped soft serve is my fave.</Review>

Very good soft serve ice cream, I have the Reese's peanut butter blaster or whatever they call it for about $4 and it was delicious! I like how their vanilla soft serve has a slight yellow color, makes it seem like real vanilla.</Text>

<review>The veggies on the burgers are so fresh. The lettuce is actually crispy. Food isn't super greasy, and there's so many options for ice cream desserts. The staff are always friendly.< /review>< date>

They have the best ice cream and a big range of desserts. Milkshskes,sundaes,blizzards and so many different flavors to choose from makes it to decide what you want. They run specials like last month was buy a milkshake and get a 2nd one free cant beat that it allows you to get 2 different flavors< /review>

Way understaffed. They were nice, but food took way to long to get like, 20 minutes. Our friends were finished eating before we even got our food. Food was ok too. Lots of people left, they got tired of waiting<//Review>
