They answer the phone right away.  They got my Hank in quickly.  They were very courteous.  I did have to leave my boy here with them tho.  They said they would call in around two hours to discuss what can be done for my Hank.  He's had some allergies with itchiness and scratched a benign tumor and it started to bleed which is why I'm bringing Hank in to have him looked at today.  Hopefully the prices are reasonable,  if so I will definitely bring him back here again and again.<//Text>

I took my beagle in for a checkup two months ago, as I was noticing some problems with his bowels. When I got my dog back he was shaking and has a loose stools for months. The doctor said everything is fine and eight weeks later he died. The vets in the Desert are all bad and are money greedy people who don't really care about your pet all they want is money.<//review>

When I first took my very small yorkies for their annual check up to this Dr. I was happy to find a family owned business. I was even more impressed when I found myself with a dog emergency and as hospital they took excellent care of my Yorkie and the owner. I have brought all my pets here for the last 8 years and have been proud and happy to be apart of their animal pack.<//review>

Only giving 1 star because ZERO was not an option.  I took my sweet Molly, (5 year young Weim) to Dr. Gurdeep Deol because my vet's xray machine wasn't working.  He took her to the back room away from us, then came out and said he wouldn't be able to help me without full payment upfront in CASH $3,000!  -  no checks or CC.  My husband had to go to the bank to get the cash, while I waited in the lobby for him to return with the cash. They took the money and within minutes he called me to an exam room, she was laid out with her belly open - dead.  Just matter of fact, without emotion or sense caring whatsoever, he said he couldn't save her...... Sobbing and stunned in disbelief at what we had just experienced  - we left without the love of our life, sweet Molly.  I actually can't believe Animal Hospital of the Desert is still in business after reading all the terrible reviews and stories.  I was in an emergency situation and didn't have the time or state of mind to look at reviews before I took her in. Believe me and the rest of us who have written about Dr. Gurdeep Deol, NEVER take your beloved pet to this place! :'''(< /review>

My daughters cat was taken in critical condition. I wish I'd thought of the amazing Dr. Hicks who would not have chiseled us financially, for sure. $800+ to tap and drain lungs.  Never going back. Do not go there. It's no wonder business is very low volume there. Plus, we took her to Banning hospital by recommendation from vet assistant friend after lungs filled again and they charged $150 to tap and drain @$50 for the visit. True Angel's of animals work there which is bonus!<//text>

Our little poodle was attacked by a coyote.  Not being from this area, we took a chance on this vet. They got us right in and fixed her up quick. I even got a call one week later to check on how she was doing. A little on the high side, not enough to bring down his rating.<//review>

Animal Hospital of Desert has been our vet for over 6 years now, they have treated all our fur babies.  From puppy to senior care, Dr. Deol and his team have used compassion and clarity .  We have used their dental services, regular check ups, emergency care ( they opened up the office on a Sunday to assist our puppy when he swallowed a blob of play doh).  When the time came, they were there to guide us and comfort us when our babies crossed over the rainbow bridge.  We have been given options when it comes to medical care and the Dr. takes time to listen to our concerns.
They offer convenient hours and we never have trouble getting an appt.<//text>

My husband & i wish to warn anyone who will read reviews before picking a vet. Do not pick Dr. Deoul. I wish I did not have to put any star. Our experience is horrific. We brought our two cocker spaniels in for an annual blood panel and vaccinations. A well check up. We received a great report on their blood. Our dogs have never been sick in their 8.5 years of life. Very healthy.  We were very disappointed on arriving the doctor did not even come into the room to greet us. A young staff gal led us to room & suggested it would all go faster if she could take dogs one by one to back room for exam, blood draw & vaccinations. Kind of surprised we wouldn’t even see the Dr. Deoul? Figured we would see him when all was completed? Never saw him. Was led to front desk and given invoice for over $600! A bit shocked, but asked when we know blood results? Receptionist called with good blood results. Two days later our horror began. One of our cockers had a deathly reaction to the DA2PP Vaccination. She literally was dying before our eyes. We called office & was told CASUALLY if we like we could bring her in. If we like?! She had stopped eating, feverish, not drinking totally listless. We were casually brought into private room. Expecting the doctor? Receptionist returns to tell (no doctor) us they will need to draw more blood & it will cost approx $270! Receptionist tells us she would take our cocker to back room (still no doc). We were told to leave & return later for these blood results. We did, FINALLY first time we see doctor! almost $800 later and our Zoe sicker than ever. Tells us she had autoimmune reaction to vaccine, gave her a couple meds after a shot & hydrated her. He felt though her blood count went from 58 to 18, she did not need a blood transfusion. Quickly told by receptionist this bill will be $407! Omg! Along with meds to give her. Doc said if she gets worse over night call him. Returning home we noticed bright red blood after she urinated. Shocked I called office doc said IF WE LIKE could return her for a blood clotting blood test. Of course we did so! She was completely healthy before this vet. $179 after blood clotting test was told take her home the test seemed fine, & call if she got worse with yellowing in mouth & ears. I asked for a discount on invoice being that she was in perfect health, proved by her blood work up two days before, & it was their vaccination that caused it all. Of course, they are money hungry, not animal lovers, no discount because it was due to her immune response. No mercy! She was extremely yellow next am, no longer could walk, called doctor office left msg, no answer. Sent email, no response. Broken hearted we left for another vet who was awesome! She could not believe within 2 days her blood count went from 58 to 18 & Dr Deoul felt no transfusion was necessary. New vet said if blood had fallen that fast in a couple days, going another evening it surely had dropped more. She immediately got us into VCA EMERGENCY Hospital. She is now in critical condition, had a transfusion, but she’s in God’s hands working thru physicians there.  My son had horrible experience several years ago with their pug & Dr Deoul. Brought in for surgery to remove a non malignant mass on chest, dog died fours later. Son asked for refund on $300 for pills he had paid for & never had time to administer before death of dog. They said NO REFUND. If you love your pet - go elsewhere. All they care about is money! No compassion, no mercy, no love. It’s been twelve hours since our last call to Dr Deoul who has never returned our call or email. Not even to ask how precious little Zoey is. I’m sure he figures she’s dead and can’t get anymore money out of us.  Very sad. He and his staff our not meant to care for our loved ones.

Update 4/27/18 To Dr. Deol if you read your reviews at all, since u never called even to check on our healthy little Zoe before u saw her, she died at VCA Emergency Hospital this morning.< /Text>

<text>If I could give them a 0 I would. This place is extremely over priced. My cat became extremely lethargic and obviously not okay. Just for a visit with x-rays it is 270 dollars. They came back and basically told me if I was unable to pay 1800 dollars my cat would eventually die with no treatment. The girl helping them had absolutely no knowledge of anything with every other word being uhm? Rather than the doctor coming to speak with me himself he had her run back and forth between rooms to deliver information she knew nothing about. They finally shoved a pamphlet at me for a line of credit. In doing so they also suggested I go to a non profit which is more affordable for someone like me.

I ended up going to my families vet. They care about your animal and you can see that. My families vet requested x-rays from Animal Hospital of the Desert who in response wanted more money. They then tried to tell me I signed a waiver declining x-rays on a cd. I never signed any such a waiver.

I am now paying less than half of what Animal Hospital of the Desert wanted. My family vet explained everything to me being understanding of the stressful state I was in. The employees at Animal Hospital of the Desert were short and rude when they discovered I could not pay that ridiculous amount.

Animal Hospital of the Desert is a joke. They want your money and they could care less about the outcome of your pet. I would not recommend this place to anyone.</text>< Response>

They are very good with my two shih tzus and allow me to be with them when they get any treatment. As most over bearing parents know, I won't them out of my sight. Another thing that they do is match online prescription prices. My one baby needs several meds and this really helps me and my budget.

I will not hesitate to recommend Animal Hospital Of Desert.<//Text>

These people killed my dog, they are negligent and greedy.  My little dog, Paulie, weighed only 5 pounds, he had a cancerous tumor in his neck.  I told them be careful with the anesthesia because of his size.  Paulie made it through the operation but his heart stopped in recovery because they had overdosed him.</Review>

I wish I could give negative stars!!! This doctor does not care about your pet only money!! I brought my dog in and he said my dog needed over 800$ of treatment, IV's etc... I then took my dog over to Carter animal hospital for a second opinion and they told me that my dog didn't need any of the treatment that Dr. Deol said was crucial to his health. I left Carter paying only 65$ and my dog is perfectly fine and healthy again!! Dr. Deol's wife is so rude and disrespectful and neither of them care at all about animals, only money! DO NOT BRING YOUR PETS HERE!!!!!<//review>

<text>Brought my dog in for a check-up decided to get her nails trimmed last minute asked if the groomer was still available, was told that she was not and that one of the girls could do it, that they all do nails. ( my dog always gets her nails and baths at any local petco I happen to be nearby unfortunately it was too late) soo I said that would be fine they told me the price I thought well were here already. I did not see or hear from her until the nurse brought her back telling me that my dog had bitten her( showed me the cut) I was very surprised by that my dog is very friendly and has never bitten or shown any signs of aggression towards anyone before, so naturally I said I was really sorry if there was anything I could do. Then she hands her over and my dog is clinging to me after a few seconds while I am repeatedly apologizing I notice that something has soaked through my sweater and i notice my dog is all wet from her lower back and belly down, I ask why is she all wet no answer, I set my dog down on one of the chairs and she obviously gets that a little wet so I ask for a paper towel. Then I smell the cuff of my sweater and it smells like urine. By this time I get worried because my dog has never done this before either. So i tell the nurse who cut her nails and the receptionist who is also the doctor's wife that I'm worried because this is really strange behavior for my dog. Again no response. While I'm talking to them about this my dog turns her face and i notice a lot of blood in her mouth at this point my fist thought was that it was the nurses but then i realize it can't be because her cut was really small. So at this point i am beginning to get scared and ask why is my dogs mouth all bloody!? The nurse calmly tells me oh she bit herself when we were cutting her nails while she tried to bite me. I was pissed by this moment thinking why didn't you tell me to begin with why didn't you at least try to treat her or something. But I just want to get home and try to calm her down because she is shaking excessively so i pay and get home. As soon as we get home she goes to the bed and stays on the pillows she is just trying to stay away and just seems kind of scared and depressed so i lay down in front of her and i am right in front of her paws when I notice that three of her nails are bloody and the rest are bright pink almost to bleeding point by this point i want to cry, no wonder she urinated all over herself the nurse and myself not to mention why she bit her, I don't understand why she kept going after she noticed she was cutting her nails so horribly wrong or when she noticed she was hurting her. I mean I know she knew that that was what she was doing because she would have filed them but she didn't even finish butchering my dogs nails. When i noticed this I called the doctor but it was too late so i left a message for him to call me back the next day and he did I told him everything that happened and his reply was to tell me that that is normal! Hurting a small animal is normal cutting nails until they bleed is normal! Wow well if you want that kind of normal service done to your precious loved one go to them but i am never going there again my dog does not deserve that kind of treatment and not even an apology because they still think they were right. That was a 175 dollar torture/check up. I tried uploading my a picture of what it looked like the next morning hopefully this sight allows for people to see what they do there for themselves.unfortunately you can only see one of her paws there I have more pictures.</text>< pics>

I had one of my dogs teeth cleaned. I spent the 750...but they kept adding on to it. Have you ever taken your 2 doggies in for shots, and end up spending 300.00 for annual shots? This Vet only cares about Money!!!</Review>

She took client after client, leaving my child sitting there and me waiting all day! And then when she finally decided to apologize for taking so long (6 hours in), it was accompanied with "it's not my fault..." Whose fault is it then?! I believe my blunder was allowing her to be paid up front (someone else paid and left). I felt... well... disrespected. 😫The braids are well done, though. And I saw her other work, it was good.🤔 LESSON: Do NOT pay this braider up front and be clear on your appointment expectations!

Just don’t walk in here acting weird. These guys are good but they got a lotta swag. They don’t like weirdos. It would be nice if they did the hot towel and straight razor. That was the only disappointment.</review>

I scheduled an appointment two hours ahead of time and when i got there, they sent me away to wait ANOTHER two hours. Since i really needed the haircut i came back AGAIN! Then i was told to wait another thirty minutes and finally when i came back the THIRD time no one even acknowledged that i walked in so i left. Very very bad customer service, especially to a scheduled appointment.</Review>

<time>1616176891987</time><rating>5<//rating><review>First off. call and setup an appointment. It’s just common sense. These guys are busy. That’s how it works.

I took my Martin 000 here recently and they made it all around better. Plays comfortable, sounds great because it’s done right. I had only told them a quick general idea of what I wanted and got back exactly that, and more because I was blown away with the result just looking at it. They know what they’re doing so not much to say. The difference from the factory setup is huge. I read the reviews on here prior and can now say they weren’t kidding.

So initially I dropped my guitar off and when I received a call, after about two weeks, my guitar was ready. So I asked if I could bring my electric to get setup eventually, whenever they could. So on my way to pickup my acoustic I brought my strat to them because I needed it setup from the factory as well. I hadn’t seen the work yet on my Martin but when I got there and played my Martin 000 all I knew was that I was glad I came here and glad they’re going to set my strat up properly🤘🏼

Go here. Absolutely the move to do if you haven’t.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dd268a411fb7bb:0xf0a4a13925ac5b58<//gmap_id></record>

not accurate with estimates after providing all correct info. expect to pay more when you actually drop off your gear there. not friendly, time waster. wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.

// here is response to the owner's comment below : $35 was not exactly the deal breaker and i thought you at least knew that.
before making the appointment to visit you, we spoke on the phone for almost 10min about two simple things - the nut and string saddle replacement on guitar with the most standard parts options that we specifically discussed. well, in which part did you not get it completely?? what is worse is that when i asked why the cost went up for the same exact things, you didn't even care to explain why. you just said i could just take back my gear. straight up rudeness.< /Text>

<Text>it's hard to tell from the entrance to the shop, but inside is stringed instrument repair greatness! they took my Partscaster to the next level with a refret & Plek service. it took a little while, but good things come to those who wait patiently. most of us guitar players have more than one instrument, so I jammed with my other guitars while I waited. it was well worth it! the care & attention to detail these guys exhibit are second to none. highly recommended! thanks again Dan, all success to all of you at 13th Street Guitars. (in all fairness, COVID-19 hasn't helped turn around times)</Text>< Date>

I tool my Squier Modified 5 string P Bass in for a new pick up, electronics and set up. They made an inexpensive bass play incredibly well. I can't remember a setup that made a more dramatic difference. Great shop and well worth the wait. I'll be back!< /Review>

Don't think there is anything else I can add to these reviews.  Great personal service. Fantastic work.  Took my guitar in to have the neck pickup switched out, a new nut installed, and a complete set up/fret dress. While they were in there doing everything, they fixed a couple issues I was having with the guitar.  Now, no more issues and the guitar plays and sounds great.  Thanks so much!<//text>

<review>took my 1991 Gibson Explorer in for a setup. They found two Grover tuners busted.  They were able to order a matching set and replaced them all.  With strings and setup in C for only 90 bucks!  Other places charge $150 just for a setup!  Very pleased and will take all my gear here for anything needed.<//review>< user_id>

<Review>I've had work done on three guitars here: a setup on a new electric, a pickup installed in an acoustic, and a Floyd Rose replacement plus plek on another electric. They had a quick turnaround every time, much quicker than I was used to from some other shops, and the work was perfect every time. And they're nice guys.</Review>< Pictures>

The best crew to set up or repair your guitar or bass.  And treat yourself by getting your old axe PLEK'ed.  It makes a world of difference.< /Text>

Took my Fender Jazz in to get a Plek'd setup for drop C with D'Addario XL 105's. The job required a new neck, as the old neck had warped too badly to be setup, but they called and told me about the additional cost before replacing it. The new neck feels amazing, the action is so much better, and there's no fret buzz at all on any of the low frets, even given the low tuning I use. Be sure to mention the tuning you'll be playing in when you bring you instrument in, as I didn't, and they needed to re-adjust the truss-rod quickly when I picked it (which they were hapopy to do), as they had set it up for standard tuning. They did a great job, I highly recommend them.</Review>

<Review>Excellent service. Brought in a Epiphone with damaged frets. They Plecked the frets and the guitar has never played better. I own a few higher end Gibson’s and this guitar’s neck plays as nicely as a Gibson  Custom Shop guitar. So basically for $200.00 they made a $400.00 feel and play like a $4,000.00 guitar.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>This is the best guitar shop in Orange County.  I gave them a ~$800 mid-range guitar for a setup and fret treatment.  I liked the concept of the guitar when I bought it, but it never quite played the way I wanted.  The action wasn't right, and there was issues with some notes buzzing higher up on the fretboard.  Well, when I got it back, the guitar played like a premium model that would cost > $2,000 off the shelf.  They have the "magic touch" which can only be acquired with hard work and experience.  I will never start practicing with a guitar I buy before giving it to 13th Street Guitars for a setup.  No pressure, reasonable prices, EXCELLENT work.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd268a411fb7bb:0xf0a4a13925ac5b58< /Gmap_id>< pics>

<review>Extremely knowledgeable. Sometimes a small backlog on repairs, but thbat is because they know what they're doing, and there's a high demand.  Also, if they do a set up for you, you can bring it back for small tweaks at no additional charge.<//review><GmapID>0x80dd268a411fb7bb:0xf0a4a13925ac5b58</GmapID><UserId.>113273656365918898770</UserId.>< rating>

<user_id>102125971970470591992</user_id><Review>I took a chance with Hugh solely based on web reviews.  I have a unique guitar made by Mark Warr which is an extended range touch guitar not completely unlike a Chapman Stick but more "guitar-like".  Hugh didn't flinch at all. He spent plenty of one on one time with me discussing what I was looking for in the set up. He made some fantastic suggestions.  At the end of the day I had him install new strap locks in different locations from the originals, resurface the frets, and basically do a notation/action overhaul. The price was extremely reasonable and the turn around was quick.

It's rare to find a talented luthier who also takes customer service seriously.  Hugh is clearly a totally unpretentious guy who's main goal is to make any instrument play better than it ever has.<//Review>< GmapID>

Hugh is an awesome guy, patriot and luthier.  He has worked on a couple of my guitars one by hand [goldtop les paul and a mexican reissue strat on his new plek cnc] Both awesome.         I also tinker with project guitars and amateur luthier stuff and I need a lot of last second parts and  Hugh always comes through with great quality and even better prices.  Im bummed I moved away and will miss his shop!< /Text>

<Text>Sometimes you just get lucky.
I found Hugh and 13th Street Guitars looking for a used guitar on Craigslist.  When I went to check it out, I ran into 3 customers at the store.  Making small talk, I was blown away at what everyone was saying about the owner, Hugh.  They speak of him like a guitar wizard, capable of turning a kit guitar into a Martin.  It was just like the other reviews that I read online.  One of the customers even haggled with Hugh on the price...but not to pay less, to pay more!  I knew I found the right place.
I'm new to the guitar, so I didn't really know how important a good set up was.  The guitar I bought had a full set up from Hugh upon purchase.  But since playing my guitar for sometime now, and subsequently playing other guitars not set up by Hugh...even more expensive guitars not set up by Hugh, I'm convinced of his wizardry.
He also happens to be a kind person and is easy to communicate with (which sadly is worth noting in todays day and age).
If you own a musical instrument with strings, do yourself a favor and bring it to him.  It will play better and easier (yes, easier!).  I'll never take mine anywhere else and feel compelled to share my lucky find with others.< /Text>< pics>

<username>Jay Miller< /username><Time>1539810787974<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Update 10/16/2018: Still taking guitars to the guys and they are still nailing it. Brought in a Gretsch Committee, a not your every day guitar. The worked their magic (set up & pleck)and now it plays better than I ever will. Bottom line they are worth the drive, worth the time and totally worth the $.

I can't say enough good things about the shop.

I am kinda finicky when it comes to guitars and I lean towards Gretsch. That particular brand has its own bit of oddness but Gretsch players have a tendency to go their own way...over the last few years I have brought Hugh various guitars that had everything from intonation issues, Bigsby frustrations and just weird wiring. Hugh never batted an eye. He listened, said "ya we can fix that" and lo and behold the shop got'er done.

He is busy, REALLY busy so make sure when you walk in you know what you want to ask about or have done. Hugh and Tim are good guys and will be happy to answer your questions but...spending time listening to a "no really bro this is what I play" story keeps them away from the workbench. So understand that some things may not get done instantly, they are usually slammed with customers dropping off guitars.

Bottom line this place is legit. They know what they are talking about, do excellent work, make recommendations that are not about taking your money but about finding the best for parts for your axe and you PLUS they stand behind their work. If it's not the way you want they will make it work for you.

U may play a Squire or a Custom shop Les Paul or a G6120 12 string or Taylor or a Bass this shop will make it ring. They get five stars only because I cant give them six.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1542121879928, 'text': "Allan, Thank you so much for the kind words.

Nice place to chill by yourself or with friends. Greatview, locals usually hang around here. Only a touristy part during midday that someone would wander up the hill to for a quick pic.<//text>

<text>This is a beautiful little dog park on the side of the 101 freeway. They took a sad forgotten piece of dirt and turn it into a lovely, dog friendly park with some artistic flare too. It sounds weird but things like this give me a little bit of hope for the world.< /text>< GmapID>

Beautiful little park.   The only negative is occasionally dealing with the mentally ill homeless who can stop by anytime (since they live under the freeway nearby)< /review>

<UserId.>112420515671754225236< /UserId.><review>This place is a slice of heaven in the middle of Hollywood! This well constructed oasis is sure to improve the walk-ability of the area.
It's more of a 'reflective space' and DEFINITELY NOT A DOG PARK-ish... they are welcome but they must be kept ON LEASH and CLEANED UP AFTER.
It's a  great space for kids, toddlers, grandparents and foreign nannies that want to ramble incessantly on Boost Mobile while they ignore your child.😕
My family is greatful the new neighborhood get-a-way😆.
We are also grateful for the area representatives, residents, city workers and elephant activists that made it all happen 💃💃💃<//review>< gmap_id>

This IS NOT an off leash dog park! It is a park that happens to allow dogs in it. Please STOP letting your dogs off leash here. They lock the gate open every day on purpose to discourage you from doing it, along with the sign that is right in your face when you first walk in specifically outlining that dogs need to be on leashes.< /text>

<review>To the people that dont want this park to be a dog park...dont complain about it. Everyone should be able to use it. Now that you have complained and they open all the gates even to Franklin Ave. The park is ALWAYS empty. At least before the people and dogs could enjoy it. Now that you have ruined it for the dogs at least go there and use the park. Now it just sits empty and no one is ever there.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Never crowded so far since it opened but it is so appealing...don't know how long it will last.
I have only been therd duing evening or early hours. It is closed 30 minutes after sunset to 30 minutes before sunrise. Also has a small amphitheatre. Great use of space!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf3c2af41c75:0x89a57528e4013221< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

Our go to pizza place. Whenever we crave pizza we always agree on Pizza Hut. Almost always get delivery instead of carryout. We usually order on the app so we get to see the process of order received, in the over, to on it's way. We like that we can either pay with credit card or cash. They also offer contactless delivery too. We love the bone in wings as well as the pastas. We usually get the pepperoni with jalapeño, Hawaiian pizza, and the supreme. The delivery person has always been very nice and the pizza has arrived sealed and still hot.</Text>

I celebrated my graduation last night in this great restaurant. Well we enjoyed a fine evening and the venue was definitely one of the reasons for the outstanding evening. The waiters  participated in a gorgeous manner, the cooking was tasty and my guests were so  cheerful. We shall definitely return for more events. thanks very much.< /Text>

If you want fast pizza pasta breadsticks wings que papas dessert and soda.Delivery and big boxes are good when you want food for multiple people.And everyone is super nice😊Thank you for being there for everyone especially during the pandemic.< /text>

<time>1565298476473</time><review>This rating is for the "service fee". The cashier was super friendly, and even reminded me of something I'd forgotten but paid for. My order was correct and prompt.

I ordered online and picked up in store. When I paid I noticed a "service fee" charge. Apparently it's too expensive to run a business in southern California so instead of raising costs uniformly they charge this fee.

Will not be coming back.

Edit: In response to below, rate everything 5 percent then. Then I'll come back. Expecting to pay menu price isn't an outrageous request. Hidden fees are the issue, not the price.<//review>< Rate>

<Review>False advertising. Charged me more at the location even though I ordered online. My price online said a lower price, but once I got to the location they said they had to charge more because I didn't order online. Even though that's how they received my order is because I placed it online. On top of it both of orders were burnt. All you can taste is the burnt flavor and when I was at the location it did smell like they were burning something. Manager offered me a 5 dollar credit which wouldn't even cover half of what I paid. Very poor customer service. I would reccomend going to a different location or save your money and get some food somewhere else.<//Review><response>{'time': 1567636376235, 'text': "Hi David, we're sorry to hear that you had a poor experience with us recently.

Had an issue with the delivery person finding our correct apartment, spoke to manager about receiving a credit since we didn't receive our order. Called two days later & was told they had no record of our previous order or credit & had to repay again for a pizza that had been ordered, paid for & never received. Kinda frustrating<//review>

Something was strange about this stuffed Crust cheese pizza which sounds like it’d be hard mess up, but the cheese had a strange texture like it was nuked in the microwave also I don’t feel good as I’m writing this review...

The delivery gal was very nice and polite though!<//Review>

< Review>
The foods was terrible which was a werid experience for me because I've always liked pizza hut, and if you do to, make this the *one* you don't go to! The service is as equal bad as the food. I've orderd from there twice, and both times I had to wait 5 mins min. before anyone would answer. like its a policy to make you wait, and seeing as I drive by there often im pretty sure it's not because there busy. Anyway long, gross, story short *don't* eat here!</Review>

The chicken wings gave some serious food poisoning. When I complained, they said "were sorry that you had a bad experience, we hope that you will order from us again. I lost a week's pay, had to pay for urgent care and meds. Not to mention the hell I went thru. I still can't even stand to look at a chicken wing without throwing up in my mouth. Thanks pizza hut. For nothing.< /Review>

< review>
Had two vehicles repaired at this shop.  Both vehicles have broken down numerous times for the same original repair.  Stay away from this shop, they take your money and dont fix anything.  I have already paid them $4500 for both vehicles repairs. The owner has not even reached out to me  to discuss these problems or some way to resolve them.  I am a disabled vet on a limited income, nice way for a local business owner to take advantage of veteran's in his community.

Update 4-21-21
Owner finally responded to my review and had an employee (Brandon) call me.  To sum up everything.... My wife's vehicle was taken in for repairs and after several thousand dollars the same problems reappeared a short time later each time.  It was if the mechanic did a band aid repair in hopes of making more money on bogus future repairs.  One repair done by my son was a faulty oil cap ($20).  End result, the vehicle still looses power and burns oil and Brandon states that she now needs a new engine or have the engine completely rebuilt.  The only way the owner can make this right is to refund the money for all the incorrect unnecessary repairs and allow us to use the money to have another mechanic make the necessary correct repairs and allow us to put this entire horrible experience behind us and have a reliable vehicle for my wife to earn an income to support her family.<//review>

The part we replaced on your truck ended up being a defective part, and unfortunately that happens, but we warrantied that part out and fixed it for you same day with no charge and it was ok after that. On the other vehicle it was brought back to us and we ran through everything that we had fixed and the vehicle was running fine, all of the work that we had done was ok, we have all the documents, data and tests that show that all the work we had done was fine and that the car was running fine. Again we apologize that you are not satisfied and if there's anything else we can do for you just let us know."}< /Response>< rating>

<gmapID>0x80dca5396255b62b:0xeb25aceda0b106fa< /gmapID><Review>Went in for an alignment after seeing an advertised coupon price. Had an issue with the price not being what was originally told and the timeframe for a completion. Instead of leaving in frustration I was able to talk to the owner and he couldn’t have been a nicer individual. He made it rite and took care of me. They completed the wheel alignment for me at the advertise price which was half of all the other shops. And theQuality of work was top-notch. Very friendly staff, I will definitely use them in the future for my alignment needs. Also they have great communication letting you know when your vehicle is done and showing you exactly what was done. Highly recommend the shop!< /Review>< Date>

There’s nothing more I dislike than when I’m given an ETA and they take way longer than said. Anyways, went in for an alignment and my car feels great. They do a free inspection and go over the report with you which is awesome. Found a deal on Groupon and was skeptical at first but glad I chose this place to take care of my car.

<Review>This was my 3rd return visit with my vehicle.  Even though, they were running on a skeleton crew (day before Thanksgiving), I called in and they got me in same day.  Diagnosed my problem and completed it. I have also referred my son to bring in his vehicle for servicing and repairs. I am a very happy, returning customer.< /Review>< pics>

They put me in quickly, and the work was done very professionally.  They sent me the info on my front end to my phone.  I could see almost immediately what needed to be done.  And when they were done , I received the new specs.< /Review>< Date>

I've been here a couple times and each time they do such a great job. My last time was a couple days ago for struts and brakes, they were able to get me in and out fairly quickly.  These guys are real nice and upfront and will even show you the parts in question or take pictures!  Really cool and honest.  I just found this place recently but they definitely have a customer forever now! Thanks guys!< /Review>

I found this place through groupon and I'm so glad I did. Ken is extremely helpful and honest. They don't take there time to service your vehicle. They are so reliable and it's family owned. They are not expensive, they do great quality of work. If you are looking for a auto repair spot look no more! You Will not be disappointed!< /review>

I was referred by America’s Tire and I was very happy with the customer service Bear provided. Generally I worry about being taken advantage of, but felt there was an honesty vibe there. Taylor was beyond helpful getting me started with an appointment. Once there, they worked with me to get the cost within my budget and something I could afford. I’m grateful!</Text>

Was quoted nearly $300 for an alignment at BMW which should have been covered through warranty. I bought the Groupon which actually doesn't cover European cars but they worked with me and honored it and only charged me a small fee which I was more then happy with. Steven at the counter is nothing but helpful the entire time couldn't recommended enough.<//Review>

I was highly recommended by another shop who couldn't do Alignment on my F350 long bed. However when present I asked about their oil change and I was told they did full synthetic valvoline oil, then I discovered and witnessed them using O'Reilly oil instead of the product I was being billed for. Incredibly unprofessional and dishonest shop. I would caution people about this place.</Text>

Great customer service, knowledgeable staff and great work in a timely manner.

I had rebuilt my front end and I just needed an alignment to get my vehicle road worthy. Bear did a great job! I am very mechanically inclined and do most of my own work, so I know good shops when I see one. Bear Alignment and Break is a shop I can recommend to my family and my friends,  and now you as well!
Thank you Bear Alignment and Break</text>

Bear Alignment is awesome. They are professionals that take the time out to check exactly what your vehicle needs. The prices are competitive and in a number of services lower than alignment & brake shops in the area.
They also display excellent customer service which I find very important. I had the pleasure of dealing with Selena, Marcus and T.J., Each of which met me with a sincere smile and genuine kindness. Speaking to them assured me that I was in good hands. I highly recommend "Bear Alignment & Brake" for your vehicle's.<//Text>

My experience at Bear alignment and brake was more than expected. I took a leap at them servicing my vehicle with an alignment for the very first time ever. Off the bat the atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly, very helpful, informative and detailed from the service and towards any questions I needed answered. They honored their online coupon and I am returning for a future service with great pricing attached to it. I do recommend this shop to anyone looking for a more detailed oriented setting with experts that are very thorough and knowledgeable. This shop is a hidden jewel not known to many so I am spreading the word to all with confidence that you wouldn't be dissapointed after your first visit. Guaranteed!!!</Text>

Consumer be warned! I went in for a front end alignment and was told that my center link, pitman arm, etc.. had to be replaced before they could do it for $1200(I declined the repairs). They were unaware that I had brand new ones previously installed by Diesel Emissions Direct. So I went to Magnolia Wheel Alignment and Break Center and had it looked by experienced mechanics. They immediately could tell my front end was brand new and only recommend new boots. Only $150 including labor. I really don't think they are shady or are crooks but definitely very inexperienced over at bear. Being an amateur mechanic and having several family members who are expert mechanics I would Steer clear of this shop.</Text>

Had an oil change and brake inspection done here. Customer service was handled well and made me feel welcome, the servicing was done quickly, and the technology they used gave their shop a much more modern vibe. Fully reccomend< /Text>

I'm not sure why you felt it was  a gender problem.. 90% of the time our female customer service rep answers the phone.  They are trained to ask how you know you need brakes, because it helps us to with the follow up questions.  there are many parts to brakes. we don't know if you are having a hydraulic problem or a friction problem.. or you may not be having a problem at all.  We always offer a free brake inspection before trying to give you prices on things that aren't 100% the problem.  I hope that helps and you would re-consider the review and give us the opportunity to check your brake system for free.. thank you"}< /resp>

This will be one of my new favorite places in Berkeley. It's a cute hole in the wall Gelato place just outside the Downtown Berkeley BART station. I don't know how long ago they opened, but I'm glad i know their existence now.
They have just a few tables, but the plaza is a great place for overflow.
It's only a hop, skip, and jump from the movie theater, in case you're inclined to treat yourself after a movie.</text>

Taste is great. Price is a little steep for a 4 oz serving, but really worth it! Could use a few more flavors 👍<//Text>

Gelato is actually more like 4 stars, however during my visit there was limited offering, no vegan option (we had 1 vegan person in our group). Also thought the service was more like 3 stars. Payment min $5 but small size portion $4.75, felt like was forced to buy something on spot when other customers looked at me. Couldn't just pay 5$ or wasn't offered this option. Overall experience was pretty average.<//text>

< Review>
I don’t think I can express enough how much I love Almare.  I’ve been almost 2000 miles away from them since COVID started, and I still talk about them at least once a week minimum.  I’ve found nowhere else that makes rose gelato, and theirs is literally crack cocaine.  I carve the 800ish calories in a pint out of my daily diet because once I get my hands on it I develop the primal urge to eat the entire thing every single time without fail.  Probably in the top 5 best foods I’ve ever had, honestly probably in the top 3 I’m just being stingy.  All of my boys have tried rose gelato, I leave no tastebud unturned; I’ve never had a reaction worse than “it’s good”, with the scale going all the way up to friends who were visiting from across the country who still regularly angst about nowhere else having rose gelato and being thousands of miles away from Berkeley.  If it were feasible physically, I’d pay an embarrassing amount to send myself rose gelato.  Almare’s also super cute and nice to patrons, the works, but even if they were the scummiest rudest most overpriced place in Berkeley they’d still keep my patronage on rose gelato alone.  I’m an Almare simp to the point where it’s a default fact about me that people in my regular life know.  You don’t even have to trust my word on this, just get like a scoop of it and you’ll get what I’m saying.</Review>

{'time': 1602306881973, 'text': 'Ciao Samantha, what a nice review. Thanks so much, it really means a lot to us when a customer is so loyal and nice to us. I think it is the best part of my job to interact with people who like what we do!!\nSince you like the Rose, a little story for you. We use a rose extract to make it, a very gourmet product prepared on purpose for gelato. We make a custom recipe with a little beet powder (natural colorants is all we use for color) and what comes out is the pale pastel pink, delicate and aromatic flavor you know.\nOne day we were producing a very big batch for a wholesale order (we supply many restaurants around the Bay Area). At the moment of the extraction the gelato came out bright fucsia. It was unnaturally saturated and so full of color it seemed almost impossible to compare to our usual delicate pink. We checked the recipe, the ingredients, possible balance mistake but all seemed in place... So we contacted the producer, a big respectable Italian company, to complain. It turned out that the change was made on purpose!! The biggest consumer of Rose gelato is Saudi Arabia where gelato is very trendy at the moment. They apparently like their Rose neon bright Pink!! It was a disaster, we had to look for another supplier, modify and balance the recipe and we got back to our usual sweet delicate delicacy! I am so glad you like it and I hope you might be back to Berkeley soon to taste it again, maybe combined with Cardamom Custard, an amazing combo... Thanks for your support and nice words. Ciao\nSimone'}<//response>

<review>Honestly, this is the best all-around Gelato shop you will find in Berkeley. Their prices are great, with all sorts of different flavors which all are also delicious! I also really enjoy the texture of the sorbets they have here. They have a decent location in the city, but I highly recommend going to Almare Gelato Italiano if you’re in the area.< /review>< pics>

<text>Great selection of flavors, like lavender blueberry and ricotta orange.  Both great.  Others with us had coffee, chocolate and hazelnut.  All good.  Texture was smooth and silky on the tongue.  Definitely worth a visit when in the area.  Patio area outside is great for enjoying the gelato while people watching.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb6T31qL_l5jVHLuYgAjKIANxJVK9Aw0bphi60=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Well, this is as good as it gets pretty much.  The Gelato is made fresh there and it is comparable or better than any of the "best" I've had in Italy. Smooth, rich and creamy in texture, it melts in your mouth and brings forth a deep satisfaction and reverence for the finest.  I've been back here several times in many years - my dad even came up from Southern California and he really was speechless... a man whose made his life in Italian food/wine catering and food-service, now that's a rarity for him!  You have to appreciate the complexity in the simple to really appreciate what this place brings. Glad to have this touch of Italy (made with love).</Review>

Luxurious flavors, always feels like a treat coming here. They pretty reliably have a couple sorbets, which is important for some of my lactose-intolerant friends. Sometimes a bit cramped and loud for my taste inside, but there's now a nice plaza with tables right outside.</Review>

Very delicious and a good price for such great quality. The lady at the counter was super nice and patient in helping me choose good flavors. I am definitely going back for more.<//Text>

Delicious Italian style gelato: less sweet and fatty than ice creams and authentic flavors. High quality product. It would deserve a more spacious shop.< /text>

This is the best gelato I've found in the bay area.  Each flavor has real flavor in it - it doesn't all just taste like sugar and cream (although there is plenty of sugar and cream!).  Every day has different flavors - all made on site that day.  I sure wish I lived closer to Berkeley.  My favorite is the toasted almond and fig but I also loved pineapple and mint, salted caramel, and coconut.  And the only reason I'm not listing more flavors was because those are the only ones I had time to eat!< /Text>

My absolute favorite gelato place -- they made me fall in love with their toasted almond with caramelized fig!  I love it so much that friends know to bring a quart over when I throw dinner parties (I have great friends!).  Adorable little spot right in front of the Downtown Berkeley BART station.  Friendly staff, nice selection of treats, and decent amount of seating.< /review>

<Text>They make their gelato in house every morning, and the menu changes depending on the day you visit. Delicious gelato! I highly recommend strawberry cheesecake flavor.
They also sell chocolate on a stick that you can melt in a cup of warm water or milk and enjoy a creamy hot chocolate at home. Highly recommend!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1515556478841, 'text': 'Thank you Ekaterina for the review, we are very happy you enjoyed our gelato. Ciao'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

Please stop making people buy candy they don’t want when they don’t have cash for purchases under $5. Get an atm or utilize Venmo. Also, it isn’t legal to require a minimum purchase just because you’re weary of card fees. You’re a business, plan around it.</Text>

Lots of gelato options in the Gourmet Ghetto, but my favorite is Almare. The others are great to try, but they can't replace Almare in the heart of my tongue. (So to speak.)

(FYI: I recommend trying something different each time till you decide on your own favorites, but mine is the chocolate-hazelnut. My wife's is hazelnut.)</text>

Excellent gelato. Especially liked the selection of "adult" flavors, including pistachio, almond fig, hazelnut, and coffee.

And despite being a trendy place in a high-traffic part of the city, they didn't rip my face off with their prices either, which was nice.<//text>

<Text>The gelato is within the normal range of pricing, and it is fantastic. The almond and fig gelato is something special, delicately flavored and creamy. It's a small store, so while there are tables, it's a safe bet to assume this will be more of a walking and eating. Great for sunny day walks through downtown Berkeley.< /Text>< Date>

<text>They let you try as many flavors as you want! And wow the flavors are so flavorful compared to most ice cream places. Way better than any other icecream-like dish I've ever had, hands down.

That said, take this review with a grain of salt - at time of writing, the only other gelato I've tried was 1. at an airport I don't even remember at a stopover in some east-ish flyover state or other, which was terrible 2. the gelato place in the gourmet ghetto, which was only as good as I'm used to ice cream being. So while Almare is absolutely amazing, I haven't compared it to other good gelato places.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Stopped in Almare on a whim while walking after dinner last night. SO glad we did. Lovely atmosphere and both the girls working were really nice and gave recommendations, as I was being indecisive! They gladly offered to let me sample many flavors, and I also got a free chai latte (because she accidentally made an extra.) Great experience and the gelato was AMAZING. Will be back.<//text>

<review>This is where you can find authentic Italian gelato in a nice selection of flavors.  Pistachio is my all time favorite.  There is no American made pistachio ice cream that can even come close to pistachio gelato and at Almare they make it just as good as any gelato I've ever had in Italy.
Coconut and tiramisu are also awesome flavors to try.  The only way my visit there could have been better would be if they had strawberry and cream flavors to choose from - they go together really well with pistachio.
Besides the gelato, they offer Italian coffee, cookies and chocolates.
If you appreciate good service and authentic Italian gelato, you gotta give Almare a try - you won't be disappointed !< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The people that work here are extremely friendly and very helpful-- very nice people.  The gelato is absolutely spectacular.  The best gelato I have ever had!  The flavors are extraordinary, and like nothing you would find in a normal ice cream shop.  I had a raspberry flavor-- it tasted like there were real fresh raspberries in it!  The whiskey flavor tasted like actual whiskey, like they just poured it right in there, and the rose and lemon were amazing as well-- I could actually taste and feel the sourness of the lemon as if it were an actual lemon.

This place rocks.

Not to mention their hot chocolate was thickly amazing-- it was like the whole drink was just a rich, melted chunk of chocolate.

Go here!  It really is great.</text>

You will find this place just outside the BART station. Very convenient if you come from a long ride and want something cold and refreshing. The place is really small (take the ice cream and go eat it outside, there are only three or four tables if I'm not mistaken), but has what you've come for - gelato. A proper gelato. The staff is friendly and patient, even if you have a hard time deciding (and you will have a hard time deciding).

They have different tastes (I can't for the love of god remember how many they had last weekend, when I was there, but I'd say at least 16 different ones). They also have a sign outside of their establishment that will tell you the "specials" for the season. I'll have to come again to see how they change.

I ordered rose, vanilla and pistachio. All three were really good! You can have them in a cone or in a cup (better choice, if you don't want to get all "ice creamy"). The price is by the amount of scoops you'll have and it's pricey, yes (this is Berkeley, don't forget that), but then again, it is a very tasty gelato.

They also offer hot chocolate, coffee, tea and some other nuts and chocolate, if you're not into ice cream, but that's not the point.

Will come back for more, for sure. :)< /Review>

Amazing gelato with a loyalty reward program. Hopefully BART construction doesn't hurt business because this is a gem.<//Review>

Run by two FOB and awesome Italians. Unparalleled gelato experience.
Try: pistachio, hazelnut and their viscous hot chocolate shot!</text>

< Review>
I can't say much about the quality of gelato that i bought, since i came across not one, but two dark hairs in my cup (i'm blonde, so no, it's not mine). First try = last try.< /Review>

{'time': 1475879057707, 'text': 'Dear Anna,\nwe are very sorry that your gelato experience was underwhelming at the poi that you gave us 2 star. was it really so bed? We spend 5 hours making the gelato fresh every morning and spend a lot of resources in finding the best ingredients. The recipes are from my uncle that made gelato in Italy for more  than 60 years.\nAny ways if you want to come back another time we are more that happy to let you try a lot more samples and if you call us we can also show you how me make it. Otherwise we know that de gustibus non disputandum est. Ciao ciao.\nAlberto'}<//Response>

Un gelato cremoso, con un profumo e un gusto buonissimo, buone sia le creme che i gusti alla frutta. Originale il gusto alla rosa.<//text><name>Fulvia Crescini<//name></record></dataset><record>

Customer service is great. Employees are very helpful and friendly. Stores always organized and clean. Negative points would be quality of some of the tools and not very large inventory to choose from.<//review>

Did my research, and decided to purchase the Hercules 12" Sliding Compound Miter Saw with the Hercules Stand. I've read quite a few reviews, and decided that for my level of use, I should be satisfied for the price. I looked at the Dewalt...but was more that I wanted to pay. Besides, I'll  be going back and purchase the protection plan. I know they have a good 90 day return policy, I want a little bit of extra protection. I'm going to purchase the Hercules 80 teeth blade for doing fine cutting in the future. Plan on getting more items later. By the way, Thanks  to John the Manager. He was the one that helped me out and loaded  up my truck. Great job Harbor Freight. I really enjoy shopping here...everything's in it's place.<//Text>

If you are needing a tool of any kind but you are not a pro and need something that will do the job harbor freight is the place for you. Many different told, always stocked and this store is one of the cleanest I've seen. Coupon book is a must have in your mail delivery.</Text>

<review>Although it's very clean since it's newly opened, their new return policy really stinks! I received something as a gift some time ago and wanted to exchange it for the more expensive model and since I didn't have a receipt they wouldn't allow it. (It's not like I wanted money back) Also, whomever designed the place to face east was off their rocker. You can't enter the tiny parking lot from the other stores parking lot which is ridiculous! If you are in the large parking lot you have to cross 12th Ave and go into Home Depot parking lot to turn around and go back to be able to enter or just enter from 12th Ave. Lastly, having a "Parking Lot" sale, they definitely should have more than 2 registers opened especially when 6 other employees are just walking around and can clearly see the lines! Get it together HF!<//review>< pics>

Good prices, great selection, have own brand for cost effective reliable alternatives. Sometimes misleading external store advertising: "Liquidation Sale" generally does NOT refer to store or brand! Overall, a good go-to for all types of tools; professional, handyman, and/or hobbyist.< /review>

I'm so quick to complain and sometimes don't give kudos to those whom deserve them.
Not long ago, I posted a negative post about Harbor Fright of Hanford. I've since visited the store countless times. It's a big toy store to me.

I can't help myself, the prices are great!  The coupons to save on an already on sale item.  Super Savings. I am lame, I'll admit, again I couldn't find an item.  I asked as Associate to assistance and he took me to every item on my list.
The kind of service an associate wants to provide,  loves the job so much that it to the Associate, seems effortless.  I thank the Associate that helped me.
The counter Associates are very patient, supper helpful and friendly

We all have bad days. I regret the things said in an earlier post. Me having a bad day.  Please forgive me for any inconvenience I may have caused.
It's so good to have Harbor Freight in our Community.

Thank you Harbor Freight.

Best Regards,
TK<//Text>

Harbor Freight is Harbor Freight, you get what you pay for. One thing that was sorry to see is the parking lot in front of the store makes the place look like a third world country.<//Text>

<review>It's a place to go where if you need some starter off type tools and accessories, the prices are very cheap to reasonable depending on what you need. Some of these  items to me are like throw away type stuff depending on what you buy. Their Car Jack's are nice and get the job done. I recommend either the 3 or 4 ton floor jacks. If something get lost or broken it's not that big of a deal because the items are cheap and you can just go buy another one.  Make sure you use their store coupons for those will surely save you even more money. Will definitely shop and buy here again. The staff was also very helpful and friendly.</review>< GmapID>

<review>Parking lot is cramped. The store on the other hand was very well organized and nice. Everything was easy to locate and the staff were helpful and inquiring on if I received my magazines and emails. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the parking alone they could have better designed the parking area.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I love harbor frieght. So happy they opened a store in the town I love in. The employees at the Hanford store are on top of thier game. I ask them where any item is on my way into the store and they immediately give you the aisle number & which bay to look at. Excellent customer service all around. These are homeowner level tools and priced accordingly.    Without this store, a lot of people in our community would not be able to fix their own cars and houses.They are an asset to our community. GOOD JOB & THANK YOU!< /text>

Cool small store. I really like the tools selection. Feels like they're a bit sneaky about signing you up for the free rewards plan but other than that no complaints.<//text>

They said that they could not help me since I have not paid for notifications.  Sounds like they could have helped if I would have paid a fee.  They knew that I had made the drive.

This was a big disappointment as I have purchased many items over several years at many stores.< /Review>< Pictures>

All you need is there,even surprises. Imagine my surprise when after a long conversation about air tools I find out the dude helping me is Herman or hermy the elf from Rudolf the red nose reindeer. Turns  out the whole dentist gig didn't work out. Apparently he has to stay 500 yards away from the kids or something some kind of misunderstanding. But ya great tools.<//review>

(Translated by Google) It is very useful to me t ok gives class of tools for my activities in general maintenance, my own use at home and work areas. I personally recommend these stores. "You have one near you, and they have us."

Much more of a personal experience than similar places we have gone to. My 3 year old daughter enjoyed every moment being there! She got to be a firefighter on a motorcycle helping the city, a mommy shopping and cooking dinner in a big glass like house to a race car driver racing down a ramp! They even have a small bounce house with a slide coming off it. It was so much fun for both of us. Plus everything was so clean, which makes a difference. We plan on going again very soon.< /Text>

Took my 2 year old daughter there and my husband and I loved it. She had so much fun and it was nice and clean. I had a comfy place to sit with my 3 month old while they played. Very friendly service. My husband liked it so much he bought a month pass. It was our first time at an indoor playground and it was the perfect size. I would  totally recommend this to a friend and anyone with small children, will differently be going back.<//text>

This place is great. It's nice and quaint. My 4 year old had a blast and it wasn't too noisy or crazy for my 7 month old. We both enjoyed watching her play. Very friendly staff and can't beat the price.</Text>

<Review>I absolutely love this place! Staff is friendly and helpful,  place is clean. The location size is perfect,  easy to keep an eye on your little one (2yr old) from one spot. I ended up getting a membership after my 1st visit and I haven't looked back. 😁❤<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1556121099573, 'text': 'thanks!!'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcc8328c79b82d:0xd30a6505ff8bf2ed<//Gmap_id></record>

Fun place for kids up to the age of 6 y/o. It’s like a inside playground, excluding the swings. The pictures online for the place is exactly what you get. They do have a small room in the back that has a projector in the ceiling, so you can play soccer, Waco a mole, etc type of games on the floor. The owners were very nice and they played good songs for the kids on the  speakers. Which is big for me, I hate taking my daughter places and they are playing songs adults are listening too in a place for children.</Text>

This place is cool because you can almost see every area from the front of the building. That means you can let the kids roam free. One thing I didn't like is that's dirty. The staff can make more of an effort to maintain it cleaner.<//text>

This playground is super clean and very affordable. The owners are very involved and kind. For kids under 5 years old, this place is the best. However, we just had a birthday party here and kids up to 12 years old in our group had a blast too! It's just the best.<//text>

<Review>Great place for all small children! You can stay all day. Bring your lunch, they have a place to eat with seating for your little ones (and free coffee). Changing station separate from the bathroom. Age appropriate toys for all young ones.<//Review><user_name>Suzanne Wittenbrink<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We've been coming to this place for the past 3-4 years and this is the first visit that negatively surprised me. The staff is very friendly, but the actual facility is falling apart. The kids tripped and fell several times due to foam floor tiles that are ripping. The bouncing house, the climbing stairs particularly were very dirty(black). It definitely needs some deep cleaning, a snack bar with healthier choices like apples and bananas, granola bars... The floor needs a complete replacement, it's the original flooring since the location first opened and had different owners. I hope the owners can make some changes and bring more people in.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1533510780747, 'text': 'Thank you so much for bringing all the issues to our attention.

Very dirty! It just keeps getting worse. When the new owners took over they stopped cleaning properly. My 4 year old's socks and hands are black after leaving. The baby toys are filthy, and I had to clean them myself before I could let my 9 month old play with them. We let the workers know about it, but they insisted that they clean everything every night. After seeing the same dirty spots 2 weeks in a row, we know that they are not. We have been coming here for over 2 years, and it was my daughter's favorite place to play. Very disappointing that we will not be able to come back.</text>

So i have read some reviews and seen some very poor ones. I think the owners are nice however sometimes that is not enough. I dont know exactly what these owners have done but whatever it is they have scared off many customers. I purchased a membership for my 2 kids back in july and everytime i went there were 4 or less kids. Many regulars that i used to see were no longer there. My kids love playing at hippity hop but i dont pay $54 a month to have my kids play by themselves when they can just do that at home. There is also a lot of renovation to be done around the place and for some reason they dont?< /review>

Prices are twice as high or more than other kids club we go to with my grandkids, but to be fair they have only half the activities available. The other club is well worth the drive. Sorry, you lost me as a customer< /review>

<text>I took my two girls to this establishment to play, and the woman who owns the place sold me a ONE YEAR OLD mocha frap bottled drink.   I drank 3/4 before noticing that it expired more than a year ago in 2015.  She claimed she just bought it at Costco, I don't believe her.  She was probably trying to make a few extra bucks by not throwing it away.  Disgusting!!!< /text>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1468109686440, 'text': 'Hi Ryan, at first, we are so sorry about your bad feeling but your drink\'s expiration is still valid. She misread the expiration date. It was July, 11, 2016. not 2015. The number "6" looks like "5" but it is 2016. I took out all mocha frap which was purchased last month to sell before they were expired on July 4th. It was my fault not to tell her. I hope you understand that. Please visit us again! We still keep your bottle, so we can show you and explain. Once again, we are so sorry about misleading.'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dcc8328c79b82d:0xd30a6505ff8bf2ed< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great place with a good breakfast and meat. I had the pancake special and it all tasted great in particular the sausage and thick bacon. The eggs were fluffy and the pancake a bit in the thick side and all tasty. They have 2 kinds of fries , skinny mcdonald like fries and steak fries. I recommend asking for the steak fries when asking for their special fries( asada, chili cheese, island). I heavily recommend their pastrami which is great. Will come back 9/10( i didn't like the cheese for the special fries)<//review>

Durango burger is across the street and one of my favorites. The staff here are the best. Down to earth clean and excellent food. Laurashark thinks the breakfast burritos are spicy but she is crazy. Plus theyre supposed to be last I checked.<//Review>

<Text>I fell in love with this place from the first time my step dad treated me here. Since then I have turned this into my own family spot my kids love the burgers here never complain about the food, they eat it all and me and my girl always look forward to the deliciousness. If you live in  Inglewood or just in the city for a visit this is a must try, right off the 105 Freeway Exit easy to get to, easy to spot. Thankyou Durango Burgers<//Text>< Pics>

Great food, lowkey location. I definitely the huevos rancheros, which is, by far, the best I've ever had. The tortilla was still crunchy, and the food was adequately spicy without being overpowering.</text>

< Review>
I have been a loyal customer since November. 2012. I used to be a meat and cheese lover but have been on a vegan journey for 7 months now. The last time I was here I was only on my moral journey for 3 months today its longer. I simply asked if they can wash their hands before fixing my vegan sandwich. And one of the cooks says I'm being too difficult all because i asked for him to wash his hands. They told me if i dont want it I dont have to eat the food. Me . Someone who has been giving them my hard earned money for 7 years. Wow.<//Review>

Good, consistent food. You see your food made to order with the grill in the open. Personally a fan of the chili cheese fries and a bacon cheese burger.</Text>

<Text>Parking, drive through, quick and easy food. Friendly staff, Parking lot eat inside and seating outside, restrooms outside. Children booster seats. All you can drink soda machine. Finally got to try the Tamale which was a 5 star tasted great. Last couple of times we came in they ran out. Five star for a very clean, great fast food diner. Excellent friendly staff today.</Text>< name>

LOVE LOVE LOVE Wienerschnitzel!
I love their Strawberry Lemonade thats usually my go to drink when I eat here.
We love getting one of the Crowd Pleaser Combos they are a great deal, plus they offer a Military Discount! The only down side with our last visit was the cheese on the chili dogs was different, not inside the bun under the dog like usual, it was shredded on top. It was still tasty! Just missed the old way :) we’ll always be back<//Text>

I had a really good experience at this Wienerschnitzel. The person I was very friendly and efficient. The food came out quickly after our order and it was hot and fresh. Restaurant is very clean. If you’re looking for a good Wienerschnitzel the visit I recommend this one highly.</review>

They get your food to you fast, and it tastes pretty darn good. The only downsides are that their drive-thru lane is very cramped, and their prices are pretty high, despite their "fast food" status.< /Review>

What's there to say about chili dogs and corn dogs. They are always hot and buns are super soft. I especially like that you can still get dipped cones, I just wish I could get them with the crunches on them like used to be able to.</Review>

We went inside and ordered our food, big order. I goofed and said Polish dog, instead of sandwich, they made a dog...when I got the food and asked where my Polish was...my friend and the owner said, you said Dog not Sandwich. The owner was so kind he offered to make my sandwich, which they did perfectly. They are always good. From San Diego to Salt Lake City, I've never had a bad experience at Weinerschnitzel! Love you!<//text>

It was okay...but I wished I would have gotten the polish dog with chili instead when I started eating. The service is good and the place was clean. Good place to go eat. If you need to use the restroom, they have you go outside to the back of the building and let you into the bathroom. That was the part I wasn't very happy about.

What can you say, it's a wiener schnitzel. It's clean and the food is hot and fresh. About once a year I get a craving for a chili cheese dog I'll go in and get five of them and a large drink and I'm good for the rest of the year! I must say their French fries are some of the best fast food chain fries out there.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I know a couple people who work at this shop and they are very decent people who have worked there for many years being overworked and underpaid. For those of you who have coupons, I suggest telling them that you have the coupon at the menu box, while placing your order. To pop up at the window after all is said and done, and present a coupon, really slows down the entire thing. So yes, you are "putting them out". How would you like to have to redo the entire order slip, when YOU COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING AT THE BEGINNING. Trust me, when you do stuff like that, of course they dont want your service. A little common sense and compassion for those who work fast food and SERVE YOU FOOD, goes a long way. In other words, your snooty, holier then thou, review is invalid. To top it off, it's just a hot dog. If you want the kind of service that goes along with steak and wine, then maybe you should go to one of those places, or simply walk your lazy ass inside so they can see your stupid coupon. Just my thoughts. The food is fresh and the managers take good care of the place. It may be an old place and the owner doesn't want to upgrade, but that isn't the fault of those who work there.<//text>< Pictures>

I had never eaten at a Weinerschnitzel before but I was pleasantly surprised. The selection is good and the food itself was well prepared and tasty. The staff was very friendly, including a kid who appeared to be off the clock but helped us out anyway.<//Review>

This was one of the most expensive lunches I've had in awhile. Wienerschnitzel now gives you the option to "upgrade" your hot dog to all beef or polish, but what i didn't realise is that each upgrade was almost two dollars more. Not much of a taste difference to be honest.<//Text>

< Review>
I ordered from my car! 2 Polish Dogs-1with saurkraut & mustard, the other plain.  We came straight home & they were luke warm! Ordered I regular Chili Cheese Fries, they were barely warm & NO CHEESE, so I grated my own cheese & heated them in microwave. Just a SMALL dab of Chile too. Then you gave us another order of fries I didn't even order, but I probably paid for, my son said the berry shake was super! We have been to your place several times, but was really disappointed tonight. That was actually my second meal today.  So then I tried to call & talk to the manager, let it ring about 30 times & no one answered. The weird thing is, you weren't even real busy! I most likely will not come back! All this time, I called again & still no answer! That's unacceptable!! I've been in Customer Service most of my life. I'm 68 & Manage an 82 units here on Gray Ave. Hope there was a good reason for our food being Luke warm & the mistakes in our order!</Review>

Horrible customer service at the drive thru.  I dont know what the employee at the window is going through but he seems to hate his job.  I felt I was completely putting him out when he took my order and I definitely put him out at the window when I gave him a coupon it was just ridiculous.  Won't be going back til they get employees who are happy to have me there.</text>
