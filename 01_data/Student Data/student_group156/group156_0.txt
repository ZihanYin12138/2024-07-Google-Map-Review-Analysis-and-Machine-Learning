Not only are they incredibly kind and professional but the work they do is amazing.  It had been a long time since I last had a professional cleaning so I was a little nervous but they made me feel so comfortable right off the bat. The hygienist Haleh did a wonderful job with my teeth, they are so clean and beautiful I almost didn't recognize my own teeth.
I also take my daughter to this office. Dr. New and the hygienist are so good with kids it's very comforting to know my children are in good hands.
I am moving out of the area but if I could continue care with them I would feel incredibly happy to use this office as my life long dental care.

Thank you so much Dr. New and team!</review>< pictures>

Never thought I'd write that it is a pleasure to go to the dentist. The entire staff and Dr. New create an atmosphere of welcome and encouragement. Michela told me that they care for people through dentistry, teaching us how to care for ourselves.

Dr. New gives a 'play by play' of what she is doing, what you might feel, what sound is coming up. I found this to be very reassuring. Great humor.

Thank you, each one!!!</text>

<text>Such a wonderful welcoming practice, i’ve always been a nervous Nancy it when it comes to going to the dentist but the second you walk in your greeted with a warmth and kindness.

Haleh the hygienist in the back is amazing and explained everything to you while she’s cleaning your teeth and Dr. New is always friendly and keeps it real when it comes to letting you know what you need to deal with your mouth! If you’re looking for a new dentist I highly recommend coming here.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>Dr. New and her dental assistants are the absolute best in the dental field! My son is afraid of needles and therefore didn’t want a numbing shot before his filling. She only used topical paste on him, and he didn’t feel a thing. She’s state of the art with regards to technology, very detailed, explains everything step by step as you go, and had fun names for her Dental instruments  :) she’s a perfectionist and that suits my teeth just fine! I should also mention, I’ve never had to wait, the front desk is extremely helpful and professional.< /review><username>S. Wiggins<//username>< user>

My first appointment with Dr. Nice and her team went very well. The hygienists were very professional and kind. The admin woman is very nice also. What I really appreciated about Dr. Nice (and her team) is her calm, straightforward, non-castrophizing approach, very refreshing compared to previous dentistry experiences. She also explained some technical aspects very nicely. I feel good about my choice.<//text>

<review>Prior to seeing Dr. New, I had not seen a dentist in 8 years. I had very few positive or non traumatic experiences with dentists and I went to Dr. New after seeing all the great reviews. Dr. New and her staff changed my perspective. Everyone is cheerful and positive, the dental hygienists and staff are super knowledgeable and very helpful. Dr. New is very thorough and careful to explain everything she is doing- the what, the why and how. Bonus: Dr. New has a playroom/dental setup for the little ones with toys and drawings to make it a good experience for them. I can't wait to bring my toddler in for her first dental exam.

Customer service: Courteous, kind, informative, caring and professional.

Family friendly: Pediatric dental care with playroom and all.

State of the art: A lot of tech incorporated into the practice such as tiny powerful cameras that sends my dental imaging to a screen for me to watch  Dental chairs are heated and have built in massage functions.< /review>< Pics>

Dr. New and all the staff at her office are an absolute joy. Not only are they pleasant, they are very knowledgeable, professional, attentive, and always ensure you are comfortable. They are meticulous with their work and really take the time to properly clean your teeth. Every visit, I leave with valuable info and tips that will help me maintain my health forever. I highly recommend the office if you are looking for a dedicated team to care for your oral health.

Thank you!<//review>

<Review>I had a great experience with Dr. New. I hadn’t been to a dentist in a few years, so I was most impressed by how gentle they were. Also, everyone was very friendly and professional and they explained everything they were doing. Dr. New was great about some things on a watch list and only addressing the things that were an immediate issue. I’ve only had one appointment so far, but I would highly recommend this practice!< /Review>< user_name>

<text>I had a wonderful experience with Dr. New and her staff.
Everyone is very nice and makes you feel very comfortable.
I appreciate how she explains everything that she will be doing and answering all my  questions.
Dr. New takes her time and really gets to know you as a person as well as a client, That is very important, in trusting someone. I am very impressed with such a young woman being as knowledgeable, gentle and caring as she is.
I was a patient of Dr. Spate, who I just loved, but he has retired. So, I feel very lucky to have someone as good as Dr. New to continue with. Big 5 Stars!</text>< GmapID>

<text>What an amazing group of individuals!!! Cannot recommend enough. I’ve always struggled with “going to the dentist” due to bad experiences - dishonesty, poor billing, and up-selling to name a few. Jennifer and the whole staff changed all that for me. From my first visit I felt like I’d been a patient for years. Professional, welcoming, kind, honest, and super funny! I no longer have anxiety about my dental care and even look forward to my future appointments!
Thank you all so much ♥️🦷</text>< pics>

Just had my first visit recently. I had a very attentive and details-oriented hygienist, the initial intake X-rays and photos were painless (literally and figuratively), and Dr. New was very clear and patient when explaining everything to me.

I too was a long term Dr. Carlson patient and was wondering what the new dentist would be like.  Well, he selected the best possible candidate for the job.  My first and subsequent visits with Dr. New were wonderful.  I was seen immediately.  All procedures were explained to me.  I was asked if I preferred anesthetic or not and was advised that I could have it later if I wished.  The crown was done and Dr. New fine-tuned the fit of the teeth with each other. When the bite was not quite right, she immediately saw me and refined the fit which is now excellent.  I highly recommend her to you.  State of the art equipment and a great chair-side manner make her a 5-star pick!  Thank you, Dr. New!<//text>

<review>JENNIFER TOOK OVER AFTER DR. CARLSON RETIRED.  I WENT TO HIM FOR 25 YEARS, I THINK.  DR. CARLSON WAS MY 'BUD', AND THE BEST DENTIST I HAVE EVER HAD.  WHEN JENNIFER AND HER STAFF TOOK OVER, THE TRANSITION WAS SO SMOOTH AND EASY FOR ME.  THESE PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL!  NOT ONLY DO THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF, BUT THEY ARE TRULY 'GOOD PEOPLE'.  YOU CAN FEEL THAT FROM WHEN YOU WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR.  i ALWAYS GET A SMILE FROM EVERYONE, AND THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE, GOOD CONVERSATION, AND ALWAYS A FEW LAUGHS WHEN I'M THERE.  THANKS, JEN, AND MY GIRLS!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fcad680bb4941:0xea76dc635b84dcb6<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I trusted the recommendation of Dr. New by my retiring dentist of 40 years.  I knew he would only recommend someone who was conscientious, well educated, and a people person.  Dr. New exceeded my expectations by being all that and more.  I love all her modern equipment and gentle style.  I highly recommend her.< /review>

High quality dentistry. She advises you of what she's doing and is very caring of your comfort. All employees are very personable. Dr. New was even willing to come in on her day off to fix a very minor chip on my tooth.< /Text>

Dr. New is fantastic. She is friendly, has a gentle touch and makes me feel very comfortable during my office visits. She has replaced two of my crowns. During the procedures she made sure that I was at ease, under no stress and pain-free. Highly recommend her!< /review>

Dr. New and her staff restored my teeth that had over 60 years of wear and tear on them. i was missing a few teeth and she worked with Dr Walker, who installed three implants. Dr New spent a lot of time communicating all my options to restoring my teeth.  She did a spectacular job at creating a movie star smile.  i'm very, very happy with all the work she did to make my teeth look far, far better than they EVER looked.  she's as up to date as a dentist could be on miraculous modern dentistry.<//review>

Dr. New has the expertise of a much more experienced dentist as well as being up to date on all the latest methods and technologies. She uses computerized x-rays that minimize patient exposure, and instant imaging on a large computer screen that maximize patient communication.

I have had services from cleanings to consulting on dental implants. I have been very pleased with her work, and that of all the other members of her clinical and office staff.

If you need a dentist of the highest caliber who will show kindness and dedication to your health, I strongly suggest that you see Dr. New.<//review>

The front desk did not treat in a polite way with patient. I'v heard it before but I was not sure about it!
My appointment was early in the morning and I found there is a traffic and I cannot make it ontime, I called them to reschedule.
The front desk (she) mentioned, our staff are here from early in the morning to prepare for your session and the next session is 10:45 and now they have to wait until 10:45 for other patient! You should let us know 24 hrs prior to your appointment and...
I felt guilty in the way she told me the story and I said okay I try to do my best but there is always rush hours in the morning.
I got stock in traffic for 1 and half an hour and recieved 20 minutes later than what she mentioned by phone!
Considering that I explained the situation of traffic for them prior to my session, surprisingly she told me we cannot accept you when I arrived!!!!!!</Text>

I thought I would have a hard time finding a great dentist after Dr. Carlson retired, but I found one in Dr. New. In addition to general dentistry services, she helped me out with the repair of my chipped front teeth, a job no other dentist would tackle. She did a fantastic job and I couldn't be happier.  She also has a nice office environment and staff.< /review>

When my prior dentist retired after nearly 30 years of treating me, I wasn't sure if I'd ever find that level of genuine care again. Not only is Dr. New up to date with the latest dental technology, she quickly took time to get to know ME. Her expert care and attention are top notch and her staff went the extra mile to get a denied insurance claim paid.  Who doesn't love saving money?! I wouldn't think of going anywhere else. You shouldn't either!</Text>< pics>

The doctor constantly told me what she was doing and what I should expect and the lack of surprises made it a far better experience than I've had at other dentists.

<Text>Dr. Jennifer New is fantastic.  I was devastated when my dentist of 45 years retired.  Fortunately Dr. New took over the practice and I cannot say enough good things about her.  She is caring, gentle and does exceptional work.  She makes herself available for emergency care even at times that I'm sure are inconvenient for her.    She has a great personality and takes the stress out of going to the dentist.<//Text><time>1440260069670</time>< response>

Dr. New and her top-notch staff (they really listen to you) provide the latest technology employed in excellent dental technique. All this is provided with warm fuzzy, holding-your-hand comfort.</review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I feel like I am getting state of the art dental care every time I am seen by Dr. New. The staff are all extremely capable, friendly, and efficient; the tools and technology are up to date (I love the new Xrays); and Dr. New herself is both skilled and very enjoyable to interact with. She explains what she is about to do before she proceeds so you always know what exactly is going on. Patient care and comfort are very important to Dr. New and her staff. I recently had to have a slightly difficult filing repaired. Dr. New put me at ease and had me on my way in no time. I recently moved to Half Moon Bay but will continue to drive down to San Jose for appointments. It's worth it!</review>< Date>

It's rare when you find a dentist that you can't wait to see. I have had the wonderful privilege of having two. Dr Daniel Spate had the practice previous to Dr. New and I went to him for 25 years. When Dr. New took over his practice because of an early retirement, of course I feared that she could never measure up to Dr. Spate. WRONG! She's great. Painless and very caring. She uses all of the latest technology and let's you know why she's doing what she's doing. Thank's Dr. New you have made what could have been a traumatic transition a very pleasant experience.< /text>

Dr. New and her staff are unmatched in the service they provide! NEVER before has everyone in my house been excited to go to the dentist, even my nervous husband who has had a lifelong fear of the dentist is finally back to great dental health thanks to Dr. New and her commitment to her patients!</Text>

This place will steal your money if you try to pay with your card inside!!!!! They got me for $9.99 after telling me my card was declined and to run it as credit (which was also declined). However, at the pump, my card worked just fine. When i noticed my pending transactions later that same day, i returned to the store and tried talking to the employee who had helped me. She started ranting and raving that I was out to get her when i asked to see the copies of both declined receipts as she had only given me one. She then proceeded to take the reeceipts out laying them down one by one. Right before the decline which i had a copy for, i noticed the previous receipt was for $9.99. I asked to see the receipt to make sure it wasn't an accidental charge and this employee flipped out. I will never go here again. A few months back the same incident happened to my roommate, same gas station but different employee. They got her for $30. It seems that this is acceptable employee practices and behavior to this Valero owner, shame on you!!!!!</text>

The host of this tour was great. Loved him he made this experience really fun but the boat itself was pretty boring. I thought I’d be more fun than jet ski but it really wasn’t. Just so you know before you go, ITS A TOUR ! You don’t go by yourself and if you get pretty slow people in your group don’t expect to go fast or anything. You are going to have to wait for them to catch up.<//Text>

This was a BLAST and the crew was so nice and accommodating, they worked with us even after a little mistake had occurred... in which they could have made the outcome sad for us... but they worked with us and got us in a boat and in the tour! And it was appreciated! Really fun! Recommend highly!</text>

I’m from San Diego and I loved this tour. It was so fun to sail on the water and see the sights. Captain John was professional and informative. He kept us safe and entertained as we sail around the bay. The spots and photo ops were perfect and we have lots to look back on from this amazing tour. We will be doing this again soon. Thank you!!< /text>

Me and my boyfriend had so much fun doing this. It's something that you should really do when you're gonna do vacation in San Diego. The tour and the views are just so perfect, the tour guide was so funny that you actually enjoy listening to him, there was no boring moment and everyone with us had so much fun, me and my bf even switch in driving, the tour guide let us do it so we noth actually were able to experience driving<//review>

I planned this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was an amazing adventure. The boat is simple to drive and the instructor/tour guide will go over everything u need to know. It was the best way to spend our day and see the Harbor in a different way. Our tour guide was very friendly and professional. Bring some cash for tip later to show them you appreciate them.
This was a great thing to do during Covid since we were in our own boat and kept a distance from other groups.</text>

It was great to get out on the water and visit the points of interest with a knowledgeable guide. I was worried that this would feel like a nose-to-tail horseback trail ride. NOT-AT-ALL. So you follow in the wake of the guide. It makes no difference except to give you the confidence that you are going in the right direction. Then, when you hit a point of interest, BAM...you get all the info you need. Reminds me of a cycle tour of other cities. Very informative and out there, active participation. Totally exceeded expectations.< /review>

Booked the boat tour a few days in advance, got a call the next day they overbooked the tour and that they wanted to reschedule me. I told them I was only able to go that time since I was in town for a wedding and asked if they could ask someone else if they could reschedule. They said no then we are going to cancel. No apology, didn't seem to be bothered by it at all, it almost seemed like it happens all the time based on how non-chalant the person was on the phone. I was super excited to go and disappointed they couldn't accommodate me after already charging me for the experience.<//Review>

My experience with the manager was absolutely terrible. I’m sure the speedboat tour would’ve been amazing but the people were not. I was accused of stealing a speedboat. Argued with over the phone about a refund and told that my group was under the influence when we had not even seen the manager face to face. After disrespecting me for 30 minutes over the phone he realized he was wrong and needed to give me a refund after I presented all of the information I needed to prove my group needed a refund.
I would not have someone like him running my company.< /Text>

He was knowledgeable about the area but the water as well. Being a boater, I was a little worried about inexperienced people being on the water but Captain Scott did a great job educating everyone on the basics of water safety and was clearly watching out on the water for other people and picking the safest areas and times to go FAST and actually have a blast!! He was the perfect “Papa Duck”.

As for the tour itself, we went to several different places, got to see the USS Midway up close and personal, got to see dozens of sea lions, and our course got to drive our own personal little speed boat!!! I don’t remember if there’s options but I wouldn’t do anything less than a 2 hour tour (if it’s an option). You don’t get too wet but you are on the water, so bathing suit and appropriate over clothes and sun screen would be perfect. I wouldn’t bring anything big, there’s not a lot of room for big bags and definitely not small items that aren’t on your body (if you want to keep them in the boat). I brought my keys, a water bottle, and my phone/wallet (which second person in the boat held onto). Totally worth the money, can’t wait to go again soon!!!

What an incredible morning we had for my wife’s birthday, with our tour guide Captain Scott. Two hour tour (about 90 mins on the water) and you are in total control. Think of it like horseback riding on speedboats.

On the tour you get to open it up full throttle and chop through the waves, passing Navy Vessels and the San Diego skyline. Highlights, besides the speed, was passing the USS Lincoln aircraft carrier, seeing live sea lions play in your boat wake, driving right next to and under the USS Midway, and our guide Scott.

We were lucky enough to have the tour all to ourselves at 11:00am on a Monday and Scott was awesome and personal. He made us feel comfortable and capable and driving the speedboats is easy no matter your experience level. Amazing day on the water and money completely well spent!

Tips: 1. You do NOT get wet so don’t worry about that, dress for weather. 2. Bring cash for a tip (Scott deserves it in these times) 3. Sunscreen on hot days there is no shade unless you count the Midway!<//Review>

It was a lot of fun. I got the 2 person boat for my son and I.  I got to drive for half and then we switched and he drove the other half. He had a blast. I will be booking another trip soon for my wife and I. If your in San Diego definitely check it out.< /text>

I absolutely loved the tour. You get a quick tutorial at the beginning. I love that you control the boat yourself and it’s easy and fast. Gives a great view of San Diego and some fun facts.< /Text>

<Text>Despite the initial hilarity of watching the guide, Geronimo, save one of our party from being stuck in a perpetual doughnut turn in their boat, the time on the water was amazing.  It was great to be able to see all those sites from the ocean and the enjoyment of steering your own speed boat back and forth on the water was thrilling.  Overall it was worth every penny and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested.< /Text>< Pics>

My boyfriend and I came here for the first time and it was awesome ! We had so much fun. The only reason i am giving it 4 out of 5 stars , is due to the crew being a little unorganized as well as starting our adventure late, which took from our time on the water. Other than that really fun and cool experience !< /review>

We had a great time with our awesome guide John! He was really funny and shared a lot of great facts about San Diego. The only things we would change is that we got a late start because some members of our tour group were late. Also we had to go slow at some points because of how some people were driving their boats. It would be neat if there could be private tours where you could actually go fast the whole trip with the guide.<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>A total rip off! There isn’t much a of a “tour”! The boats are slow and the instructor spent most of his time doubling back to help other people. We rode past the sea lions then turned around and came back. You spend most of your time cruising and then spend about 5 mins in throttle. The operation instructions aren’t very good. And it was just a total bore. We had to stay single file and weren’t able to experience the speed of the boat. If you deciding between thing a jet skis. Do the jet skis. Hell, kayaking would be better than this garbage!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I booked a boat ride for myself and family. My son was with me and my 6yr old daughter went with dad. I was so nervous at first never driven a boat or been out that far into the bay. Let me tell you we had the most amazing time my daughter loved it even when the ride got super bumpy seemed to be when we had the most fun. The tour guy was amazing made it simple not to much to know just follow boat ahead and made us feel safe ! Worth the money definitely recommend<//Text>

<Review>One of our favorite things we've done on the trip. We had a great guide, driving the speedboat was super fun, and the tour part of it was very cool. Seeing the seals and the aircraft carriers up close was SO COOL!<//Review>< Pics>

Our guide was fabulous!  I was scared at fist, being I'd never been on a speed boat. After a quick briefing and about 20 minutes in, I felt like a pro!  It was so much fun!  Thanks again. This adventure was worth every penny and we will be back soon!   You rock!!!!

He explained to us the route, told us to have fun, explained to us the different boats and much more that was on the water. I would strongly reccomend to anyone to take the tour! FUN!!!<//text><user>100630969399692121494< /user>< Name>

Great ride, had awesome time. For $150 you cannot do better. Only negative - some chicks in front of us couldn’t get their grip on it, almost hit a ship, then rocks. Didn’t feel safe with them behind us. This slowed down the ride of the whole group, but still, 5 stars</text>

Had a great time on the boat tour. Boats were really easy to operate. Instructors were very informative and   Helpful. It was hard to hear at times on the walkie when we were going fast, but overall it was a 5 star day. Highly recommend this tour if your in San Diego.< /Review>

We are locals here in San Diego.  And having experience your services,  we must admit that this was one of our best days here on the water as San diegans.  But since this was a birthday celebration, it was that much more magical. Thank you so very much San Diego speed boat adventure for this memorable day.

First off, I had trouble on the website and Chris was quick to respond to my email and help me out.

This adventure was exactly as advertised.  Our guide Scott let us know before we left the dock what to expect, what the water was going to be like, and how to maneuver the boat during choppy waters. We had a great time and would definitely book another adventure with this company.</review>

my own mistake for thinking it’s speedboat rental, it isn’t. It’s a tour. quite slow I may add. my friend had a good time, but it was
somewhat boring for me - I expected more speed from speedboat. not my cup of tea.
nice people, good crew, just hoped to get
more rush, adrenaline.

also, absence of parking is a bummer.<//text>

I had a great time on the water and an awesome tour guide. I scheduled earlier in the day so I was lucky enough to be the only boat on tour. Don't be afraid to go fast and jump some waves! The boats are pretty wide on the front end so they are hard to tip... The views are just breathtaking and you'll see some wildlife and some Navy ships along the way. Very cool experience!< /Review>

This was a pretty awesome experience over all, although, we did have an issue...There were issues starting the boat which was a major problem when we stalled out in front of a charter boat and couldn't get the boat started again. I would highly suggest, to the company, some type of brief training  (or a two way radio system) to safely notify the guide of issues.<//review>

Beware!! Scam alert!! Please be advised that the 2 hour boat ride they advertise is actually about an hour if you’re lucky. I asked our guide why we finished in an hour and he said “ well we say two hours for you to prepare for that”. Huh?? I asked the lady at the front desk which by the way when I first came in to the office, I told her I was here for my reservation she then says, “ and do you have a question?!” Yes I do, I don’t know what to do or where to go. Thanks for your attitude. She is miserable behind her desk and you won’t get much help from her. So disappointed with this tour. It is not 2 hours, and customer service is bad bad bad.<//review>

Really awesome adventure. You get to see the USS Midway and the nautical museum from the outside looking in. The bait barge was a cool stop as well. Really fun zipping around the bay while the naval base has helicopters and planes flying above. Totally recommend and am looking into checking out their Tampa facility.</Review>

<Review>Decided I wanted to do this for my birthday. Even though I've lived here my whole life, it was a blast and informative. You get to see a side of San Diego that even locals don't normally see.

It is an excellent experience! You can drive by yourself and go fast as instructed by the coach. The staffs are extremely friendly and experienced. All rules and safety awareness were shared up front and the coach will lead the whole team (we had 5 boats in our team). A best experienced and definitely worth!< /text>

<text>San Diego Speed Boat Adventures provided me a great first time experience riding a speedboat and I had loads of fun. However, other guests slowed down frequently during the tour. Perhaps due to language barriers (and not understanding the basic instructions) or discomfort with driving fast on the waves. I don't think the tour guide discussed expectations and provided reassurance before the tour. This sparked my interest in speed boating.<//text>< pictures>

<review>We had a great time - we needed to change dates and the manager Chris was accommodating and helpful!  We went today and had an awesome experience! We got a full 2hr tour of the harbor. We saw seals and sea lions and viewed the USS Midway from underneath along with the Maritime Museum and of course the beautiful Coronado Bridge and City Skyline from boating on the water.  It was GREAT!  Will definitely go again soon!  Thanks< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Easy to make a reservation, friendly service from beginning to end and the speed boat was SO MUCH FUN!   Captain Duck (that’s what he said we could call him) was great with making sure he explained how the boat worked, the area we’d be traveling & even giving us some history on local landmarks (hard to hear him at times due to engine noise).  This is definitely an activity to do if you are visiting or if you’re a local.  Hint:  great 1st date activity,)< /review>

<time>1568331234820<//time><rating>5<//rating><review>I brought my six-year-old on this speed boat adventure. It was super fun. At first it was a little intimidating when I heard the instructors giving details of how to drive the boat. But it really is much more simple than you think it will be. When we got off our flight at the San Diego airport, it is only an eight dollar cab ride away. We had a few hours before we could check into our hotel so we headed over and it was good decision!. They held our bags for us which was really nice!
All in all, a wonderful way to start our vacation<//review>< pics>

<text>The adventure itself was very fun.  Our guide was very good and he did his best with people who quite frankly couldn’t follow very basic instructions on how to operate the boats and operate them safely.  The boat in front of of got us into dangerous situations because the driver did not apply full throttle for fast moving as instructed and was to worried about the pictures his wife or girlfriend was taking.  Having been in boats before and extensive maritime and air safety training, I was able to operate and make it look as if nothing out of the ordinary was occurring- other than the jackass in front of us being well behind the boats in front of him.  I am surprised if there has not been accidents or injuries in theses boats as people always think they know much more than they do and want to be aggressive and boastful rather than safe and conservative in their decision making.  It was a great way to see the harbor in a fun way.  I wouldn’t do it again, mostly for safety reasons.<//text>< pics>

<Review>The speed boat ride was really awesome. We called in morning for reservations, luckily they were able to accommodate us for 5pm ride. Scott was our tour guide. He would drive in his boat in infront and we need to follow him on our speed boats. He always keep eye on us if we need any help or if we speeding too much or too slow. Our boat motor caught a plastic carried by high wind from earlier day. All we have to do is wave to Scott. He is the best tour guide ever. I only drove car twice in my life till this ride. Scott made sure we came back in one piece and have as much fun as we could.< /Review>< Pictures>

My husband and I were looking for something fun to do in San Diego and stumbled upon Speedboat Adventures.. and boy, I’m glad we did! We’ve done harbor cruises/tours before but this was 10x better than any of those experiences! I loved that we got to drive our own small speedboat. It went a lot faster than I expected.. I was screaming and laughing the whole time! Our tour guide was cool too.. very informative and fun! Definitely an experience to remember!< /review>

The women at the desk was SO nice and great.  The two men gave clear instructions, although it may be easier if uve driven a boat before, if not it's not hard to pick up as they walk you through the steps.  I am not giving it 5 stars because I wouldn't call the boats speedboats...though the experience was fun all the same!<//Text>

And it seems like the attendant took this for granted, which was so disrespectful.  It was too urgent for us to change our plan, so we canceled the reservation. As we asked for an email confirmation of this change, the answer was not friendly, either. Based on this experience, we think probably Go Cards reservations are prone to last-minute changes.< /Text>< pictures>

My wife and I bought the Go San Diego card and we're trying to find something to do one of the mornings and decided to give this a try. We absolutely loved it. Looking back on our trip in the airport we actually felt like this was the most enjoyable thing we did while we were in San Diego. For those of you who are wondering how it works, we called and made a reservation for the next morning, which was really easy, filled out some waivers online, showed up the next morning and got to drive our own little speed motor boats on a tour around the harbor. It was such an awesome experience. We loved our guide Ryan, and everything we got to see and experience while out driving our own boats! You absolutely should sign up for this if you buy a Go San Diego card, even if you don't have the card, I'd highly recommend this tour!<//review>

This is an amazing experience for me and my parents. The instructions in the confirmation email are super clear about the meeting spot and parking. Our captain Ryan is very patient and helpful. In the middle of our trip, the motor was tangled by seaweed. Ryan came and helped disentangle them.<//review>

Decided to do the 2hr speed boat with my boyfriend from 9am to 11am and it was definitely an adventure. I'm not an adventurer at all but my boyfriend is so I decided it would be a fun thing to do while in San Deigo. You get to see the city from the speed boat in a way you wouldn't on land which is nice. Our guide from Tampa was very friendly and explained how to use the boat. If you are looking to have a memorable experience in San Diego besides the usual stroll book this 2 hr speed boat adventure (one boat fits two people). You will be able to take tons of pics and video on your phone just fine. Be sure to wear sunglasses and a hat. Thanks speedboat adventure team as this was the highlight of our trip. What are you waiting for? Book it, you won't regret it!<//Review>

Awesome! way to explore San Diego harbor”
also a good way to introduce boating for people who have never been on a speed boat.

I recommend it, it was definitely fun I wish there was little more freedom to explore the harbor on your own but it’s a group thing.<//Text>

The highlight of our day. This tour was exactly what we wanted, informative and entertaining narrative as we explored the bay, and between stops the thrill of racing along the waves. We've done this twice, and my wife and I both think it is a great value.

The staff is energetic and friendly, safety conscious and entertaining. The entire business is the kind that you want to see successfull.

Calm days are great for families and kids, but if you want a real thrill, go when its windy. The larger waves mean a thrilling ride that would put most rollercoasters to shame. Some boats are faster then others, but I'm not telling, this way I can keep them to myself when I come back!

Wish I could give 10 stars.</review>

Such a FUN way to see the city!  My husband and I have spent a little time on boats so we were super excited to do this tour.  Having our own speed boat to play around with in the bay sounded like the perfect way to spend an afternoon.  We did the 3pm tour which was the perfect time of day – not too hot!  You get a quick lesson and overview of what you will see then you head out on the boats.  Its about a 2 hour tour around the bay and worth EVERY penny.  Our guide was Jason and he was fantastic – very fun as well as knowledgeable about boats and the San Diego.   If you have two people that want to drive, you can switch ½ way through.  This is a great activity for people visiting San Diego, or even San Diego natives like us!</Text>

<review>We had a blast and the boats are actually very fast. Try to get one with a 50hp motor. Most have 30hp. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. Our favorite part was seeing the seals up close. Beware, if you go too fast over a large wave the boat will get airborne.</review><gmapID>0x80deab6b310efb73:0x92512bd5733c94d9<//gmapID></record>

Due to this time I booked trip from passport website, it can use 2 times discount code on official website, but when I arrival registered counter, employee said the discount code just use one times , so she plus 20.37 USD in my payment , it was bad experience on customers feeling , hope it can write discount principles clearly. Customers will not be confused about payment. can you add "poka yoke" function on your website ? if one promotion code input twice, it should show " double input same promotion code"</Review>

{'time': 1570483255144, 'text': "Hello Jeng Wei Chen, I would like to start off by saying that this review reflects nothing about our actual tour. You can't use the same promo code twice.  It's like going to a grocery store with one coupon and asking them to scan it more than once to get a bigger discount. It doesn't work like that. In your case you found a promo code and entered it more than once to get a total of 28% off of your tour. We did not catch it when the reservation was made but when you arrived we saw that you used the same promo code twice. I know you thought you could get by without us catching it...but you got caught."}<//resp>

<Text>Booked our reservation over the phone 4 days ahead of time, only to have it cancelled on us the evening before our 11:00 AM time-slot. Had to find last minute reservations elsewhere because of this.

Update: they called back and were willing to reschedule us for 1:00 PM the day we were supposed to go, even though the San Diego Go Pass is technically only for the 9:00 or 11:00 AM timeslots. And honestly - this was one of the highlights of our stay in San Diego. Don't think we've ever laughed and screamed quite that much. We had a blast out on the water, and our tour guide was excellent. Would rate 5/5 if not for the initial cancellation. Highly recommend for anyone in the San Diego area.<//Text>< user>

We were delayed due to our hotel not bringing  our car up on time, charged the fee and watched our boat group leave without us. The young lady saw our disappointment and made other accommodations for us. Needless to say we were back on track with only having to wait until the next tour started. Well worth the wait!! Thanks so much.< /Review>

Another great experience.  This was my third time doing and its always super fun.   The pricing vs experience/time is a awesome value.   It will be an event that I will do each time in San Diego.   The tour was also detailed.   Karl was great guide and very helpful.  He even took photos of the entire group, making sure they had a great time.  I cant recommend this enough to folks looking for a  unique way to see San Diego.  See you next Summer!!!<//review>

Speed boat was soo much fun. It was included in go pass. Guide was awesome. Its in the harbor so the waves are not big. Keep distance from other speed boats and you wont feel any waves.< /text>

Good but was expecting more of a speed. The customer service and employees great, route / tour views were nice but boats are kind of outdated and engines on most of the boats (at least in our group tour) were 30hp so it’s not too much “Fun to drive”. We got this as part of Go Pass San Diego so can’t complain much but definitely won’t pay full price for it.< /text>

There was emphasis on safety that was perfectly balanced between not being dangerous and letting each boat have fun. Great tour. Would definitely recommend and do again. Prepare to get a little wet from mist and wind so a light jacket may be helpful but on a nice sunny day t-shirt and shorts or pants are fine too. Just expect a little wetness. Think log ride at Disney or Knott's. Maybe less if you go straight and don't want to zig zag and stop and go to quickly.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Dont buy san diego go card if your doing it for this attraction they gave me and my friends the run around and put us on a waiting list when they had openings still...which we know because we had someone else call...first thing they ask is if you have coupon or go card if yes then you will be put on waiting list n if at the last minute they have an opening they will call you and expect you to rush over there....they lied and said they were completely booked. that is unacceptable and they should not be part of the san diego go card if they are not going to honor it<//Text>

< Review>
Stay away from this place because there boats are not in a good shape. Me and girlfriend decided to speed boat adventure on Sunday afternoon. We were on vacation and wanted to have fun. I forgot my captain name but while giving the instruction he said not all the boats are same means some of the boats motar is new and some is old. Let's put it this way I got the lucky one. It was alright and we didn't even speed halfway because we had to get from the doc. I didn't knew i had the lucky one. While we were in the middle of the ocean our captain said speed up and mine didn't speed up. We all were giving number of our boat and I was told since you've issues going on you go last. The whole adventure I couldn't speed up and the captain itself apologized to me. Next day i call the corporate owner it self talked with me and said let me find out all the details and I will give you call back. He didn't called me so I called again next day and said everything was fine captain didn't say anything about that boat. I was like am I lying ?? Why would i waste my time I'm being honest and boat clearly had the issue. Ended up giving me 30% off my final bill but I still think it wasn't worth it because paying $150 to get the adventure but I didn't got one.</Review>

<Review>Terrible experience. We bought san diego go card from costco and this was one of the attractions we looked forward to do, however, it turned out to be a nightmare for me and my wife. We did this on Jun 30, 9 am. It was fine for first 30 minutes or so and all of a sudden our boat stopped working and we were left stranded in the middle of the ocean for more than 45 minutes. We did everything. We gave the distress signs, whistled to get the guides attention but in vain. He did not spot us because he sped off,  as a guide he should have made sure everyone are following before he took off or atleast stay in the middle so he can spot every rider. We called the office and she tried to reach the guide and in the meantime our boat was driven by the ocean winds as the steering does not work. It was SCARY!! It took the guide 45 minutes to spot us and rather than being appologetic we were shocked when he had asked us how we ended up here. The wind dragged the boat to other end of the ocean. We were so excited to do this but it turned out to be a "LOST" adventure. I will not be recommending this to my friends and family. The guide should always keep track of the riders. Period!! Unable to locate us for almost 45 minutes in the middle of ocean is unacceptable.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
{'time': 1563564981645, 'text': 'Hello Kota Vijay,  Thank you for taking the time to review our tour.  We are very sorry that you had trouble on our tour.  The main rule we have on tour is to follow the boat in front of you.  This was the rule that you were unable to follow.  The entire tour turned left and you went the opposite direction which then caused you to run your boat aground which is what caused it to stall.  That is why we ask everyone to follow in a single file line as there are shallow spots in San Diego Bay. By doing this you ruined the tour for all the other boats while the tour guide had to search for you.  We have had thousands of guests come out on our tour and some have never driven a car and most have never driven a boat yet there is never an issue of one of the boats just taking off from the tour route.  Once again we are very sorry that you had a less than pleasant time on our tour but if you had followed the directions given by your guide this situation would have never happened.  Thank you.'}< /response>

<text>At first i was nervous because I had never been on a speed boat or anything like it before. But once we got out there it was so beautiful so informative and so much fun. Flying around on the boats while the tour guide keeps you safe doing it is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone. Our guide was jason and he gave us so much information about everything we were seeing. We even got to go underneath the uss midway. You got to slow down at certain points and see everything and get the best pictures. Will definitely be back< /text>< Pics>

Awesome experience! They take you on a full tour of the harbor. Get to see seals and sea lions from very close up, and a view of the USS Midway from underneath.
Definitely of the best things to do if visiting San Diego.</Review>

Amazing tour, great guide.  It was so neat to see the famous boats and the sea lions up close from the water side!  I will say that my assigned boat had technical issues, but the guide was super attentive and kept coming back to re-start it (after I tried and failed).  Didn't hinder us for long; it was exhilarating speeding thru the ocean.  If you do it, count on getting wet with ocean spray at minimum, and wear sunscreen.  Thanks for a great ride!<//Text>

The gas line and radio were broken on our boat leaving my 5 year old and Floating in the harbor for an hour. The owner offered to give us another trip because ours was so bad and when we returned this summer reneged and offered us 50% of our next tour. Bad management and very bad equipment don’t waste your money go rent a jet ski and way more fun.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Everything is fine, until something goes wrong. Your guide will loose its temper, shout and yell at you and at the end, he left us alone. Frustrating. Irresponsible. And for sure unprofessional and a no-go for this price.
1. If you are taller than 6', we cannot recommend this tour. We have bruises all over our knees.
2. If the two people in the boat are heavier than 400 lbs, we cannot recommend this. You will have to push your weight to the front of the boat for getting it "on plane", which basically means to get speed. In the beginning you will have additional weight of the full gas tank in the front to get you going. But at the end of the tour, your weight will not be enough to push down the nose of the boat and you will never get "on plane" anymore. The Guide (Bob or Rob) will make you keep trying, but if you have any understanding of physics, it is simply not possible anymore because of your weight and the mass distribution. Usually boats have a trim to adjust the motor to this weight distribution. But these boats are simple and small and don't have it or the guide didn't tell or know about it.
3. We had rather big waves. This also interrupts the traction to the water, which doesn't allow you to get speed. We ended up trying and failing.

The thing is, this trip is not a sightseeing tour. Don't expect that. You will be busy getting control over your boat and to follow the guide. He is alone in his boat and way ahead of you. They do not offer a two-way radio, there is only a speaker in the boat and while you are standing, leaning over the bow to get on plane, you will not hear a single word he says. After we mentioned this to him, he simply said "I know". How helpful is that? There are not even hand signals agreed on to have a minimum of communication with the guide.

When stopped the 2nd time, he told us that because of our problems in the beginning there will be no stop on the tour anymore. He more or less blamed us to ruin the tour for everybody else. Honestly, we didn't wanted to stop anymore and just go back. But guess what... Of course he stopped again, I ignored him first and got yelled at me again over the intercom... So I stopped and never got the boat on plane again. We were lying on the bow for the rest of the tour. Our knees hurt, our back and neck hurt. The guide was annoyed, rude and not helpful at all. If someone is yelling at you, that "nobody ever had these problems", I can tell you to read Yelp. There a dozens of reviews stating the same problems and the same carelessness. It was frustrating and nothing, we will recommend.

It might be a lot of fun, if you get speed. But there a a lot of factors, that could prevent you to get "on plane". And if so, it is no fun at all. The guide is not prepared for this situation and you might end up paying a lot of money for bad service.</Review>

Loads of fun! You will have to pay for parking but this one is worth it. You are driving a 2 seater small speed boat at maybe 30 to 40 mph and get very up close with all the sights around the bay. You can do it even if you are inexperienced with watercrafts. This was one of the funnest things we did in San Diego.<//text>

Called for reservation.  Received a call back. Said that he would check availability, that he had tours scheduled, and would call me right back. That was two hours ago. I called again and rang to VM. Boats are still tied to dock (obviously there was not a tour scheduled as he claimed) Seems really great if they actually let you go on it. Wasted two hours of vacation time waiting on the call back. Poor customer service that I don't appreciate.<//text>

There was some misunderstanding today. I made an order and waited for the Luna Grill to open. I was surprised that the confirmation did not come, but money was withdrawn from my card. I decided to wait. When the Luna Grill opened, I went to check if they had my order. I explained calmly that I had not get confirmation by my email, but the man talked to me as if I were deceiving him. He talked to me very nervously. It was a terrible communication with a client. He was very indignant that I came without order confirmation. I ask the branch manager to do more attention to the training of communication with clients.< /text>

Fast and friendly service.
For take out the fries always get a little soggy by the time home.  Not their fault but corp should think about lids with vent holes or packing fries separately or something.</review>

I love Luna grill and although this location is very small inside, I got the big Luna flavor I was craving and was happy with my meal. Service was friendly, my apple walnut salad was fresh and perfectly seasoned, and my chicken kabob and gyros plate were delicious. The lemonade in my Arnold Palmer was a little bland (I like it a bit more tart) but that's only with me looking for something to complain about. Over all it was a great experience.</Text>

<review>I gave this place so many last Chance.
They keep falling. Poor management very very bad employees and big attitude from these youngsters .
When you have a complaint or an issue with the order the managers do not want to take a phone call I’ll talk to you and they are saying that’s your problem I send email to HQ, and for some reason They don’t seem to care much.
I use Luna Gril when it’s only was one location in though they grew too big too fast I think this location is the wars I ordered a birthday dinner for 20 adults, 45 minutes I show up they told me they don’t see my orders and I had to go to the other location I called him to tell me know it’s in the Carmel Valley location.
Then I showed up in the Carmel Valley location
And they just start working on my order now after almost 2 hours later after I get my food and get home I noticed that they give me more stuff that I didn’t order in the stuff that I did order was missing when I called to explain to them they hung up the phone and said that’s your problem so not ours I send a letter to the management for some reason they don’t really care but the owners who give them jobs.

I wish to see in old enough manager with a experience with customer service and understanding that their are families that come here and looking for a quick food to buy, and so want to supervise those young kids with big attitude is the only do it because I feel like you have to

I’m stopping to shop here ever after being loyal for Luna Gril for the last eight years.
Are used to eat there 2 to 3 times a week with my coworkers at lunch are used to use them for parties.
But I lost my trust.

And the food wasn’t so fresh as well up to you people what you do this is my experience maybe some of you have a good experience but I don’t think the food is good as much anymore

The rice is mixed with yogurt!!
the chicken is mix with lemon and yogurt to keep it fresh and to extend the Freezer time.
The falafel don’t taste like falafel anymore.
More like a mix of a laugh at that you buy nothing from scratch.

I feel bad for the only Middle Eastern food that we had in the area is destroyed because there’s no supervision and management the order should be on top of things.</review><GmapID>0x80dc080977291dad:0xe946efc97bfec698<//GmapID>< user_id>

Bad service after I complain to the manager they told me that not their problem the food was what we order and the food it cooked enough it just wasn’t ready 🤮🤢
“ it’s the kitchen to blame“ she said .... great management
After sending the information to HQ they send my free appetites .... thanks for nothing after spending over $60 on a dinner that’s what they offer pathetic... I’ll never eat there again not need any free stuff from you ever
I use to order food to our real estate company once every 3 weeks will take my business elsewhere.... like PANINI KABOOB GRILL in del mar highlands town center<//review>

I think there is a lack of knowldedge in cuisine for the mediterranean, it shouldn't claim mediterranean if they do not even know how a Tabouleh salad is made.
The place looks good but the food was a big disappointment, lavash bread was feeling like old bread, not crunchy not fresh, they add celery to everything including market wrap and tabooleh salad which basically ruins the flavor of the salad and the wrap, the chicken was tasteless, not going back,< /Review>

I use to frequent this Luna Grill when it was good , now it’s gone  down hill no taste on chicken, dry and even burnt most times.  Sorry to say.  I hope they  improve! I’d rather make my own.  Not good 😞<//review>

Compared to similar Mediterranean restaurants you will pay twice as much, and wait twice as long for half the food. Don't waste your time or money.</Text>

<text>Pozo Saloon, chilled back place to come for lunch and couple drinks on a nice weekend.  Service is  good and you can’t beat the atmosphere.  Plenty of outdoor seating.  People are very friendly.  Will be a weekend trip through High mountain road from Arroyo Grande.</text></record>

I'm so happy the Saloon is open again. I grew up there and it is nice to see the same great food on the menu and still good prices for everything. The atmosphere is so laid back and fun.

After a 15 mile bike ride, we pulled in and enjoyed food that really hit the spot. The hamburger was delicious. And the porter was the best beer that our group had while in SLO.  (Didn't care for the music - but that is us.)<//Text>

< review>
This venue is waaaay the heck out in the middle of NOWHERE. Just when you think you're lost, go about 8.67 miles further, lose cell reception, and yay, you've made it! 👌😀
For the event I attended,  there were no 'in and out' privilege, however, that was not posted/communicated until AFTER the fact. Kind of a bummer. Sound was good, stage was well seen even from the back grass seating area. Not a lot of shade, so plan accordingly!<//review>

Nice place for concerts. In the middle of nowhere. Only bathrooms are port-a-potties. The food and drinks are expensive. No provided seating. Nice scenery<//text>

I am not one to typically leave a negative review, but I had THE WORST experience of my life at this nail salon. I went in for a pedicure and they were not gentle at all, they cut my cuticle so short that they made me bleed. Not to mention they were scrubbing my feet with a very rough sponge and they scraped my skin off!! They did not bother to care one bit and they charge so much just for their service that they aren’t even good at. I would not recommend this place at all!<//Review>

< review>
I have been here several times over the years; Mostly for pedicures. The pedicures are hit and miss of the quality depending on how busy they are. I couldn’t get in with my normal nail technician (at a different salon), so I got a full set of acrylics done yesterday and although they where $$ (almost double what I would have normally paid) they are perfect and exactly like the picture I showed him and I am super happy with them. They are friendly and the receptionist is always very happy and positive which is really nice.<//review>

To be fair, every time I go, and the artist has enough time to put some care into my nails, I have been very happy with the results. This salon is also cheaper for the same services than the other “good” ones in town.

The big BUT is that if you call and ask if they have room, they ALWAYS have room (this is not true). I have been waiting for 40 minutes without having my nails touched before. Even if you make an appointment days in advance they treat you like this if it’s busy.

Go on a weekday when it isn’t as busy or not at all.< /text>

My sister is getting married, so bridal went in for gel manicures. We were talked into getting the new dip manicure. The color I selected was not the color when she put it on my nails.I selected nude and bubblegum pink was put on my nails. I was not happy I let her know and the only option she gave me was to add sparkles to it. I said no but she added sparkles anyway. I said no again and not until Vickie said they could add gel color to the top to make it a different color did she listen to me that I wasn’t happy. She also cut all my nails off and ruined my cuticals. None of my nails are smooth and very uneven in the length and the shape of each nail if different.  I paid and left still incredibly unhappy.</Review>

<Text>My niece and I stopped over to get a pedicure.  We were welcomed  right away from one of the girls there.   We were waited  on right away.   They offered us a drink of our choice while we waited.   We couldn't  believe our beverage which was a Mimosas; was included in the cost!   If your looking for a salon that you will feel pampered, this is the right salon for you!   They did awesome pedicures and were very friendly!   They gave great customer service and a very clean spa too!<//Text></record>

I like this place a lot and I really want to give it 5 stars but there are a few things about this place that I just don't love. It is far more expensive than any of the other places in town. The manicure and pedicure that I have gotten have both been Perfectly adequate but not so amazing that I feel like it's worth the extra money. The atmosphere is beautiful, it is very clean, and it is a new hip nail salon.

The wine is not good. And I don't like that when you get the supreme pedicure they use plastic bags on your feet and throw them away I feel like in this day and age we should be using as little plastic as possible and so if they would be more conscious of not throwing away plastic I would feel better about visiting this place</Text>

The place itself is cute, but honestly I only go for pedicures they don't know what they are doing when it comes to gel manicures, fills, full-sets, etc. Every time I go and give them a chance on my hands I leave unhappy/feel like I wasted my money and not to mention some of the nail techs are so slow. They also say they will help you right away but takes an extra 10-20 mins to be helped. Try Platinum Nail Lounge if you are in the Windsor area, same modern vibe, provides "drinks", organized.<//review>

Literally the nail experience I have ever had in my life. We made an appointment for 4:30 they told us it would be a 20 minute wait because of walk ins. A group next to us was also waiting since 430, at 6:00 they finally take us and are so incredibly rude and unprofessional, they don’t listen to what you ask and make you feel uncomfortable, the front desk girl was the only sweet one. Also the outcome of the nails were a joke. Do yourself a favor and don’t bother trying to deal with them.<//review>

I have been there a few times & have enjoyed all, except for the first time I went. My sister was getting married, so we had reserved for all of use to get treatments. The employees did an excellent job for everyone except me. (I am too nice to make any fuss) but they did a horrible job on me. I got the works & she didn't massage my legs or arms, even though that was part of the treatment. Plus the place was empty except for us ladies, so I was frustrated with that. But even though that was a bad experience, I still have gone a few more times & those were great experiences.</Text>

<Review>I went in for a full set, one my nails cracked the very same day. My polish starting cracking off almost immediately, got a gel polish. My nail broke the next day just doing normal day to day stuff. And now I have a second broken nail that just completely came off just grabbing some paper towels. Calling tomorrow to complain and see if they can resolve the issue. After this however, I would NEVER come back.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Sorry....this review is for nail bar.
I tried to remove this from here but I cannot.

I wanted to cry today 12/3o/17 after she was done with my nails.

Kim the owner is very gifted, talented smart young woman who unfortunately is letting making more money  getting on the way of providing good services.

I have been in Nai Bar 2 times and both times my nails were done by kim the owner.

The first time I went the one located in Windsor on 10/2017. The day I went I was looking for some one to take me in without an appointment....and my hair dresser recommended her....She said appointment are not needed there. My hairdresser called and She confirmed that the owner kim will be doing my acrylic nails and the design colors I wanted.
Kim did for the most part all the work and had her staff helped her finalzing the acrylics part . I asked her to do the nail design. She did.
I showed her the picture of the design of nails upon my arrival..she came back with the colors. My only bad experience that day was at the very end...when she attempted to send me away without finishing the design because more people was coming in and She wanted to take care of them..I pointed out to her that I was feeling rushed....(she said we were done and She did not finish painting the last part of the design). I asked her to finish the job nicely.
She did not like my comment.
She asked that cashier to add 20 dollars more for the design. I did not mind as long as the job was done properly. I paid 50 dollars for acrylic nails with gel and 20 for the design. I did not mind paying 70 dollars because the nails ended up beautiful!
The second time I did my nails was today, 12/30/2017. I went to her store in Petaluma. This time I called ahead of time to make an appointment hoping I will be able to have more relax time....I did not want to feel rush.
I was told to go there at 1pm. I was approached by her receptionist asking me to pick the colors while I was waiting. I told her that I would but wanted Kim input as an  artist to make sure I pick the correct colors as the picture. Kim started her work at 2 15 pm
When Kim finally came to do my nails. She asked me if I had picked my colors. I repeated to her that I did but I wanted her input to make sure the colors were very close to the picture. She did not like it. I saw it on her face.
She started The work. I assumed that since they gave me that color tray to pick those colors were available....but when she was ready to apply the colors. We learned she did not have it. She asked me to pick more colors and She did not have all 3 brown colors I picked .....she told me I needed to pick another one QUICKLY....again she was rushing me....I picked what she had available....when I told her that the details did not look the same she said...SORRY I DO HAVE THOSE COLORS EITHER.
I left her place with another design but mine....I hated the colors....she appeared to be ready for me to tell me that she is not interested in my services because she has a lot of clients ....
She is pregnant....and a baby inside of her is exposed to chemicals. I made a comment to wear a mask to protect her unborn baby from inhaling those chemicals... and She ignored my comment.
She was so rude and unkind.
She will see her own karma.</review>

< Review>
It was absolutely horrible until Kimmie came and saved the day for both my sister and I... It was hard explaining what we wanted and regardless of how many times we explained they just didn't seem to get it. The shapes of our nails were horrible. When Kimmie came she was super nice understood our wants and needs, and helped us to the best of her abilities with nothing but kindness. There was no frustration or anger. And the problems we had were gone because of her. She does an exquisite job. I would HIGHLY recommend her if you want to get your nails done at the this location. Thank you Kimmie!!</Review>

My sister and I had an appointment for the first availability of the day for a manicure and pedicure. We sat around with our feet in cold water for a half an hour watching one women try to handle suppositly 4 appointments at once before more employees showed up. They finally started on our nails after my sister throw a fit because they started serving a walk in before us. They were done with me so quick to try and get all their walk in done that the paint job was so shoddy. They didn't even offer a discount or really apologize. No point to making an appointment they won't stick to it and then rush you out the door for someone who looks like they have money. No thank you, I'll take my business else where.< /review>

I’ve never heard of a place that neglects their jobs in such a fashion!

If I can give it zero, I would. I waited at the drive thru window for about six minutes and I know they saw me. A worker was mingling at the front register after she completed their order instead of coming and assisting me. After she finished talking to them, she didn’t even come and help me, another worker noticed that I was in the drive thru and when she opened the window she didn’t even greet me or apologize for the wait. She whispered something but I couldn’t understand because my cars quiet little engine was louder than her. I asked for a deep dish and she said that’ll be ten min in hopes of me saying I’ll just take a regular pizza instead and so I said ok, that’s fine and she looked so annoyed that I didn’t take something that was already ready. Poor customer service

Update : I just went back to the drive thru to pick up my pizza after waiting in the parking lot for about 15 min and she said oh I’m so sorry we haven’t started your pizza yet it’ll be about another 15 min<//text>

The cashiers are great and very friendly. The pizza is good when you get the ones that are out of the oven, otherwise sometimes you get the ones that have been there a while and crust is a bit hard. Other than that it's a great place to pick up a pizza.< /Text>

Very family orientated restaurant and the food was delicious. Wonderful flavors. The salsas especially the green one were delicious. The guacamole dip, was so smooth. I'm curious what they used to mash it up. Excellent service. I did need to wait a while for the food but it was so worth the wait.<//text>

The food here is by far the best in Brentwood and the service is phenomenal. Not only is the meal full of a variety of homemade authentic Mexican cuisine it’s made fresh every time I come here. Excellent choice if you want some good Mexican food.</text>

<UserId.>101366803884821235766< /UserId.><text>The very first thing I rate a Mexican establishment on, is it's salsa. Chips came with red and green salsa and a small plate of spiced chilled cabbage which I'd never seen served before. It was warm outside and I found the cabbage very refreshing. The green salsa was mild, had a deep robust flavor and was awesome!  The red salsa was ok. Nothing special, although someone in our party said it wasn't nearly as spicy as it usually was and didn't taste the same, so maybe they were just having an off day with it. The food was good and our waiter was wonderful. Someone in our party wanted a strawberry margarita but they were out of strawberries. Yet in 20 minutes, here came a wonderful frozen strawberry margarita! Our waiter had sent someone to the store for strawberries. Now THAT is service! All in all, i would definitely recommend La Hacienda Grill. I'm going to withhold opinion on the red salsa until I try it again. Yes, I'm going back!</text>< Date>

<text>Service 4.  Food 3.  Price 2.  Definitely worth a visit.  They are a bit ahead of the curve pricewise, but everybody will increase over the next year.  This can be offset by a frequent customer or other promotion.</text>< Pics>

<Review>First of all their services is not the best and if i could give this place no stars i would. I have been here before and wasn't too happy with the services but though we would give it another try. When my friend and i went in for lunch their credit card system was not working. The server does not let us know this until after we were ready to pay. Then she has the audacity to ask us if we can go get cash. When we told her we wouldn't be able to do that since we were strapped for time (on your work lunch break). She then took down our card information and said she would charge us when the system was back up. When I logged into my account to see if she was able to charge me she, i noticed she had also charged me for my friends food as well. When i called to inquire about it she them tells me "oh yeah because I couldn't get your friends card to work. I then had to explain to her that is no my problem. Just because we had lunch together does not mean i am liable for her bill!!! What she did was not legal and when i told he that she did not care and said "well then you need to tell your friend to come pay me if you want your money back." It was not about the money it was the point of it all. How did she think it was okay to charge my debit card for something that was not mine!!! Horrible!!!! I will never go there again!!!<//Review>< pictures>

It's always a bad sign when a Mexican restaurant can't even make good salsa. It was my first time there so I ordered fajitas. I figured it's hard to mess up fajitas. But they sure did! It came it what I would best describe as pasta sauce straight out of the can. It was horrible! I will definitely never be returning there!< /text>< Pics>

Went here for the first time.  It must have been karaoke night.  It was very loud.  Food was ok.  I ordered taquitos.  And said no lettuce 2 times.  And my food still came with lettuce under the sour cream and guacamole..  Ice tea was a little watered down. Service was very slow.  Took a while to get a refill or our check</Review>

Horrible service. Had to ask the waitress for everything while she was just standing around talking to other workers! Overcharged on billing & changed the tip amount I left, increasing the credit card amount billed without my permission! Had to report them to my credit card company and should have reported waitress to the police. Had been there before & enjoyed the food. Will never go back again!<//review>

This was my first time trying this place. Hostesses were nice, but unfortunately the food was not piping hot like you typically expect from a Mexican restaurant. It was almost cold, and portions were pretty small for the price. And what was up with the almost liquidfied sour cream I requested, that they charged me a dollar for?< /review>

<review>Worst food I had ordered  ever carneasada that was burnt even tasted burnt and the carneasada was so small I had asked the server lady if that's all the meat they serve she said she was new and she doesn't know much about the meal plates but I find it bs and I also had asked for extra ice in my drink and the server lady gave it to me at the end when I was already walking out the restaurant it was the worst customer service in food I had ever ran into I do not recommend this bs restaurant to any body not even worth the time or money at the end of my family's meal I ended up paying 91 for some crappy ass food that tasted like garbage<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I love this store! Toys from the 70's and 80s and great candy that isn't in every store that sells candy. The things i loved the best was their salt water taffy and jelly candy! Plus great customer service so without a doubt I will definitely go back and I would recommend.< /Review>

<review>Little toy shoppe in historical downtown Placerville. They have a lot toys I grew up with and some modern toys. Nostalgia overload when you walk in. Staff is friendly and helpful.< /review>< pics>

<review>We love T.W. Bonkers Toy & Candy Emporium.  My little boy and I regularly stop in to see what unique toy or game we can purchase this time...  They carry a great selection of toys and games, they even sell yummy hand-made chocolates and have an amazing candy selection, (reminds me of when I was a child).  They recently opened a retro arcade at the rear of the store, Pacman, Donkey Kong, Air Hockey and more…  Tony and all of the employees are friendly and more than happy to assist.  We’ve been regular customers for the past 8 years and are looking forward to many more great years ahead!</review>< date>

I brought my 8 year old in to shop for his birthday. We had such a fun time perusing this fun eclectic store! My son had an awesome time picking out treasures for his special day and when he told the cashier it was his birthday, the man informed him that he would be getting a free candy at check out! My son chose a slide whistle lollypop for his free candy, and the man slipped another extra candy in the bag as well! It was a perfect birthday outing for a boy and his Mom.< /Text>

There are some really creative and teaching toys. They have a great selection of candies. Fun decor and helpful staff. We bought a mixed bag of salt water taffy and not much of it made it 🏡. We took a few pictures, so look there too!< /Review>

This store is absolutely adorable! A lot ofnfun for both kids as well as adults. They have quite a few novelties and candies from decades ago. It will remind older people of their youth, and will captivate children who have never seen things lile it before! Something for everyone! The candy ciggs really brought me back!<//review>

If you are looking for old fashion penny style candy store from the 60s this is the place to visit, they have so many hard to find candies and price is fair. Old fashion sodas are yummy!< /Review>

Great selection of quality toys you're not likely to find at a big box store.  My son loves the Hape train display and I'm enjoying the salt water taffy selection a bit too much.  There are a number of retro elements to the store ranging from it's toy and candy selection to the mini arcade in the back - be sure to come with quarters and enjoy some Spiderman pinball, Street Fighter, Donkey Kong, Ms Pac Man, or Centipede.!</Review>< pictures>

<Date>1499449089800</Date><Response>None< /Response><Text>Such a treasure having a local store! The owner, T.W. obviously has their whole heart & soul into this venture as no wonderful detail has been overlooked. In a tired world of corporate stores pumping out mass produced junk, this is the healing remedy. Not only can young & old alike find something (or many things) to delight them within the magical toy stores walls, they can also take in, and take with them, the true "toy store" experience that is indeed so rare; this place is a GEM!!!< /Text>< username>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>T.W. Bonkers is an iconic representation of the golden age of toy stores. If you're looking for quality toys that you won't find at every big box store, this is your place. And to make it even better, it's a part of one of the cutest Main Streets in the country. Small town charm, great toys, and a wonderful owner come together to create a great experience that is worth a trip to quaint downtown Placerville.< /Review>< Pics>

My 4 year old BEGS to go in this store. Such an awesome experience, toys out for all to play with, and they answer all questions and will even sometimes break into a new toy if there isn't one out to check out. There is something for everyone, stocking stuffer type toys, awesome wooden and eco-friendly toys, classic toys that are of good quality, and the best fidget spinner selection around. And putty and slime too! The owner and manager are both AWESOME as well. A classic rad toy store, the kind of place that helps make childhood magical. LOVE THIS GREAT lil' toy store!</Text>

The perfect toy store - unique character, organized, clean, friendly and fun!  I wandered into the store to buy something for my niece and nephew.  Usually I associate toy stores with Toys R' Us which is to say, chaotic, loud and messy.  T.W. Bonkers is quite pleasantly the opposite of that.  The place is very clean and organized and you can tell that the owner (who works there) really cares about creating a fun environment -- stocking the store with popular toys, but also unique gems that you likely haven't seen before.   The owner spent a good 10-15 minutes talking with me about what I was looking for before going on to do the same thing with the next customer.  You can tell when a shopkeeper cares about their store and their customers, and T.W Bonkers is an obvious example of this.<//text>

Brenda was extremely rude to my mother and to my sister with special needs! Don't go in unless you want to be patronized.< /review>

{'time': 1499122451246, 'text': "I understand your experience at my store was challenging today. Brenda showed me the receipt you signed. My goodness, it must have been pretty bad to take the time to write 'F*ck Off' on the receipt, followed by a one star review on both Yelp and Google. Since this is my business, I want to make sure that my customers have a great time at the toy store. If you care to share the details, I would like very much to learn from this, to make sure that my customers always have a positive experience. Brenda is very popular with the local community - so much that when I bought the store in August, many people asked if I would hire her back, which I did. Sometimes we all have bad days, but it is very rare to elevate a situation to a one star review. Would you mind please helping me? Thank you!\n-Tony (t.w.)"}<//resp>

Decided to try a local hookah lounge since I was in the mood. Should be mentioned I did arrive an hour before closing... but received bad service. The guy attending in charge was kind rude to my boyfriend , and the flavor was not good .< /review>

Relaxed atmosphere. Fair prices. Awesome milk tea! And hookah, but that's a given. The guests are chill. Excellent service, owner is kind but I don't wanna butcher the spelling of his name so I won't attempt it.</text>

Hookahs are excellent. The employees are very friendly and change the charcoals on time. The couches are comfy. The owner is sprucing up the place slowly to make it more like a middle eastern place. It is looking nice. ;-)<//Review>

It would probably get five stars once the bar and restaurant reopen.  Fantastic pool area.<//Review>

<text>The lobby seem to be in order and clean also they are practicing safe covid. My sister and I shared a room. They had a coffee machine with no cups no sugar no nothing just a coffee machine and we had to call downstairs to get the stuff delivered to the room. They said there was inside dining at their restaurant. So we went upstairs got dressed and went downstairs for dining. There was no inside dining for dinner. There is inside dining for breakfast. So we ordered our food 2 take to our room. I had the fish and chips my sister had the hamburger. She said the hamburger was good the french fries were good but my fish on the other hand was horrible. The fish was way over cooked and Soggy inside that was a wasted $13 yes they charge as much as a restaurant does for food that is only rated at the low end. While we were getting dressed one of the workers opened our room door and embarrassed my sister very badly. The bathroom door is made of glass that you can see through and it did not close when you're sitting on the toilet the door will open up it did not lock that was embarrassing for me. I will never go here again. All they are interested in is taking your money. And did I mention the hotel room windows were so dirty you can hardly see out of them. And the whole night long you can hear the sound of running water. I did not have a good night sleep.</text>< user>

<Text>Everything was excellent with our stay.
Only recommendation is to have shampoo, conditioner and shower gel in the tub. We only had body lotion and soap. I don't know who uses lotion in the shower and don't know anyone not wanting shampoo and conditioner.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I have great regards for Crown Plaza's all over. I have been in Santiago de Chile and I loved it! Here I had the worst experience. I was greeted and informed of all amentities in the hotel. I also was upgraded to bigger room, which I was amazed of the back court view. Then I had a problem.

I took a shower and the shower backed filled the tub as I took the shower. I said no big deal something a 5 min clean could fix. I called and requested for someone to look at it, it was Saturday Morning. I left to Salnas California then return Sunday night wanted to take a shower. No service tech came over they said they didn't know why no one came over but would request another service ticket for Monday. Monday arrived and nothing was done, AGAIN! I called Monday afternoon and demanded to talk to the manager. Luis said, "I will ask the manager to call you tomorrow". She never called. Which I am not surprised.

I told him I need this fixed today or change my room. I refuse to stay here any longer. He said we did upgrade you. Yes to a non working shower that's not an upgrade it is a downgrade. He called a service person which fixed my tub in 2 minutes. It took 3 calls and a angry customer to get something fixed! I will no longer be staying there.<//text>< GmapID>

<Text>Website not up to date. Staff not particularly friendly. Whole floor smelled like weed. Dirty floors/towels in room. Constantly very loud in room - maybe we were next to a utility room or something. Paid extra for breakfast to be included. Breakfast is available for only 2 hours and options are incredibly limited (0 vegan options). Will not be returning.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Nice appearance, room was clean. The rooms in the tower facing El Camino Real was nice, though the room facing the rear of the hotel during the second stay was very cramped with a small window. 
There is a waste can out in the center parking lot that had not been emptied in some time, there was trash all around it. I'm sure it's a skeleton crew, but this was during the week, pretty elementary stuff.< /Review>

We had an amazing wedding night stay at the Crowne Plaza Palo Alto. Our only regret was not staying longer. We will be back for a longer visit for sure. The room was big and beautiful and very clean. We loved our deck and all of the light in the room. It exceeded our expectations.</Text>

<review>Room was wonderful (we stayed in a suite) and the pool was great.  Staff was a ghost town.  I could never get ahold of the restaurant when trying to call multiple times over the course of 3 days; also never could get ahold of guest services.  I had to walk downstairs to the front desk whenever I needed something. Despite that, we had a great stay.< /review>< Resp>

< review>
I stay there often because they have amenities like a pool and dining upon arrival I was informed that there was no room service or restaurant available and the pool was closed. They also cleaned my room the first night and then never came back the next three days. When I called down to ask why they said due to Covid however that would’ve been nice information to have upon check-in. There is an $18 a night parking fee which is outrageous. They had minimal snacks and beverages available. I literally walked down the street to another hotel that had a restaurant with seating outside and people were enjoying their pool. The Crowne Plaza has plenty of space and should be able to accommodate outdoor dining but it seems they’re not interested in providing the services I will not stay here again.< /review>

This hotel was sub par to be nice.  The reception/lobby area is very nice. Hotel check-in staff very nice and accommodating.  The pool area from what I saw looked very nice.  The room(s) however were terrible.... run down, out dated, small and dark.  The room I reserved was not what I was given.  The pictures and description on the web are not anywhere close to what is reality.I moved to 3 different rooms before I called the front desk and told them I could not stay here ... I have never done that before.The only redeeming quality was the front desk staff.  Very curtious and understanding. They were very accommodating in cancelling my reservation.<//text>

<text>Stay was nice. Restaurant and lounge was closed due to COVID-19 but it was expected. Front desk had a list of restaurants nearby that were open and offered outdoor dining. Room was clean and comfortable as usual with Crowne Plaza. Only negative was my company and I were double charged. My company prepaid for the room and after my stay I noticed that card I left for incidentals was also charged for the room. It was a minor incident as they cleared it up promptly and returned the charges.</text>< name>

<review>The hotel was minimally occupied and we were given a poor corner room.  We asked for a upgrade being a IHG member and were not given one.  The room was in poor shape with duct tape showing below the TV stand and mix matched furnishings in the room.  Completely disappointed with the stay.  Window would not open and maintenance was called but did not respond until we were leaving.  Totally unacceptable.<//review>< rate>

<Text>The ambiance at this hotel is always remarkable, elegant yet comfortable.  This hotel serves as a venue not just for conferences and trainings, but also for special events such as anniversaries.  The details of the interior and amenities in guest rooms are outstanding.  This hotel houses an intriguing art collection of colorful, modern California  labdscapes.  One of the  hotel’s legends is that the Beetles once stayed on the 8th floor, a guest suite.  The food is typically memorable and suits most palletes.  The staff aim to please.< /Text>< userid>

Was really quiet while I was there.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Had a hard time printing in the business center.  The room was spacious, though a bit dated.  Otherwise clean and nice.</Review>

The Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto was a wonderful place to stay.  My husband had surgery at Stanford so we chose the hotel based on proximity to the hospital.  They offer a discounted rate if you are at Stanford hospital (call ahead and let them know), the restaurant is very good, breakfast buffet is awesome and the room service is excellent.  We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel and very comfortable bedding for restful sleep after the hospital stay.  The entire staff was friendly and extremely helpful and kind.  They even had a wheelchair for our use as it was too far for my husband to walk after being discharged.  They are also ideally located for anything you might need - pharmacy, restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend them!</Text>

<Text>Room was nice and clean. They have new beds that were comfortable. Lavazza 😋coffee in the room and aromatherapy cream and spray to rest and relax. Shower robe and plenty of towels. The soaps that they provide weren't that great. They have a beauty mirror that's awesome! They allow pets under 25 lbs. With this said my room was clean.< /Text>< resp>

< Review>
I choose this hotel of its vicinity to Stanford University. We attended Family Week at Stanford and it made travelling to all the events easy to attend. We checked in late Friday afternoon and our room was available in the 8th floor as per my preference. A staff member knocked on our door and offered us bottled water and candy for IHG members. The room accommodations was comfortable  and spacious. We ate the breakfast buffet on Saturday and Sunday. A lot of items to choose from that will satisfy your appetite. Our server (Christina) was very attentive to our needs! Checking out was simple and the bill was accurate. Would definitely stay at this Crown Plaza when we attend another event at Stanford University in the future.</Review>

The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was luxurious and the water temp was perfect. The bed was so comfy and the room temperature controls were easy to change according to personal preferences. The room service was very accommodating and there were always cute little condiments included with the delicious food. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and the breakfast manager went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met. The pool was quiet and comfortable with towels fully stocked at all times. The pool closes at 9pm which is the only disappointing thing about this hotel.< /Text>

I truly enjoyed my 2 day stay here at Crowne Plaza. I highly recommend. Everyone was so friendly from the time I picked up the phone to make my reservation, arrived at hotel, and left. Amazing warm staff, who are always smiling and there if you need anything. The hotel is in a great location here in the Bay area.  Thank you Everyone!</Review>

The room was decent with a lot of space, but could use an upgrade. There were some spots on the rug and the chair in the living room area wasn't clean. I had to clean out the jacuzzi in the bathroom before using it. The grounds by the pool were filthy.<//text>

The hotel has removed all amenities from guest rooms, including the coffee pot. Room service was able to deliver a Coffee maker, but having to contact the front desk for every room amenity removed due to COVID was inconvenient.<//text>

Just a few list items.
Parking is a pain for oversized vehicles. They wanted to charge me for 6 spots for my truck and trailer because they didn’t have any kind of oversized parking. Got it resolved well enough. 
All doors for the three rooms we had looked like either a crow bar was used on them at one point or some sort of lock was removed. Looked bad. 
Could hear the parking lot through the door. Wasn’t awful but mentionable. 
Front desk needs to  communicate between shifts better. Was a small incident but resolved well.</Review>

Nice place to stay.  Our room was nice.  Xmas decorations were great.  Staff was friendly and helpful. They brought us a microwave to heat up some food along with some extra towel.  They also switched our room to one with double beds so we didn't have to use a cot.  Hot tub was great but the pool was really cold.  I guess it's  a good way to start your heart.  Breakfast staff was really helpful, food was good, but a little pricey. They served a smorgasbord style breakfast along with stuff from the menu.  Restrauant was spacious and clean.  Exercise room was nice.  We enjoyed the sauna also.  Available park was a little scarce.   I'd stay again for sure.</Review>

The rooms are very comfortable and somewhat luxurious but nonetheless are small.  The decor in this hotel is impeccable from an artistic point of view.  My only complaint is a loud  and constant electrical  buzzing noise that is not uncommon amongst hotels these days.  It keeps me awake and might be able to be remedied by adding more solar power to this gem of a hotel.  I am a guest here often.  I would like to hold a t raining conference here sometime, but have not yet done that.<//text>< Pictures>

The hotel is very clean and safe with comfortable beds. My husband was having surgery that was changed last minute and we needed a place close to hospital. Unfortunately hotels during the week are extremely expensive. The front desk staff helped us get the best price they could. Beth was so helpful. She made us feel as she really cared.  The food in the restaurant was not very good (dinner) but breakfast buffet was great.</text>

I found the staff at this IHG/Crowne Plaza Hotel exceptional. From the front desk, restaurant/bar wait staff, housekeeping and maintenance.....everyone was extremely polite and courteous. For example, if a staff member was toting laundry to another location and saw that a guest was on the elevator, the staff wouldn't board. I've been to other hotels where staff viewed their task more important than the comfort of a guest. I saw a number of times, staff wiping down walls and thoroughly cleaning the elevators and common areas. It seems to me that either someone is doing a very good job of recruiting the right people or the staff are trained very well.< /review>

This is one of nicer hotels in the area. However, it is pretty dated, and sometimes windows are hard to open and some equipment (lights, jacuzzi) did not work. Also staff is kind of more talking than doing - they might be sorry for some issue, but now doing much to accommodate it.
In-room breakfast could be better as well - bread is kind of stale, juice is maybe(?) fresh squeezed. Beds are awesome.<//review>

Great location hotel. Actually has a bit of history to it. You'll see signs saying the Beetles stayed on the 8th floor or the TCP protocol was hashed out in one of the conference rooms there etc. The hotel and grounds are bit nicer relative to the quality of the rooms but overall definitely comfortable stay. The pool and hot tub were great to use</Review>

Not the newest kid on the block but nice bones and still very nice.  Great decor.  Super people.  Nicely decorated for the Holidays.  Rooms a bit older but well kept.  We loved the Cabana room we had and the bathroom was nicely laid out.  Great location too.

Enjoyed out stay!< /Text>

Enjoyed my stay. Wish I could have gotten an interior room was odd having to walk outside on cobblestone flooring. Restaurant, Bar & Gym nice! & Great staff at front desk and food areas. Wifi & phone reception was not good depending on where you were in the building.< /Text>

Sunday Brunch!!! Had Sunday brunch and watched the super bowl at their restaurant and bar. The brunch is great: bottomless mimosas, hot breakfast, seafood and roasted meats AND cakes and brownies! From 10am - 2pm. Staff are super friendly, we got a table with a TV, was the easiest way to super bowl. Thumbs way up!</Review>

<Text>It is a lovely hotel and it's location is great. You have easy access to the highway and plenty of markets and restaurants around the area. Staff is friendly and rooms are very clean and cozy. 
But don't bother to use the valet it is not the greatest, better off parking yourself.
Not sure if it was just the day we stayed but we did not get to sleep past 7 am due to housekeeping in our hallways making loud noise you would of thought there was construction going on.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>The rooms are very nice and the beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are also in good condition. The air conditioning system was a bit noisy and the room (on ground floor) seemed to be a bit cold during the winter, there were no extra blankets.
Excellent breakfast, and the staff was very helpful.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Nice grounds with large pool and hot tub. Decor is a bit dated. Rooms reasonably clean. Linens and towels very nice.
I gave the value as 4/5 relative to prices to rooms in the area but overall the prices in Palo Alto are ridiculous</text>

Check in was fast, directed to our rooms, where to park. Large parking area which was appreciated. The room was lovely. Comfortable bed, plenty of pillows, lavender spray, lots of shampoo, conditioner, lotion. A tub and separate shower. The room was very quiet. The TV was easy to work and lots of channels< /Text>

I had a 2 day stay at Crowne Plaza and it was a relaxing atmosphere there. The Room Service was excellent and regular was being done and my belongings were kept tidy and Important Documents were untouched during the cleaning . 

Also while checkout i requested for my baggage to be held for 3 hours and it was immediately taken care of without any extra payment .<//Review>

Stayed at the Crowne Plaza to watch my granddaughter compete in the Stanford Womens Golf Tournament. The hotel was in close vicinity of the competition. Our accommodation was excellent. Our room was not ready at check-in so the hotel upgraded our room . The room was roomy and the beds were very comfortable. The room can with breakfast and free parking. The breakfast buffet was excellent with good variety to select from. I would have like to have late checkout during my stay!</Review>

The pool was big enough for several groups to use it at once. The food was good overall—the service top-notch. The room had only one very small window. The bar tender had never heard of a Tom Collins before and, not surprisingly didn't make a very good one. We had eight drinks between the two of us over our three-night stay. Three of them were really good. The other five were truly mediocre.</text><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /gmapID><username>Charlie's Mom< /username>< Rate>

The hotel has a great exterior that looks like it would be a great experience. 

Overall experience was not “upscale” as described by crowne plaza themselves. The room was like a motel with a window that opened onto a walkway where others could look in. The bathroom and the decor were dated. The shampoo etc, seemed low quality so I used my own,</Text>

The bed was very comfortable! The pillows were great and I usually have problems sleeping, but I’ve dived into that bed and slept throughout the whole night. Staff were all very friendly and reachable. However the room was a little dusty and cold. I have dust allergy and had to take a few medicines each night as I was having symptoms.< /Text>

We quickly dropped our stuff off at the room and noticed the room was hot even though it was cold outside, so we turned on the AC and quickly made our way to the room with the festivities.
We returned at 1am and the room was still at 80 degrees!!! It was then that we noted the heater was broken and was constantly on. We got a hold of the night manager,who's name was Janette, and she gave us a fan!!! It's 2am now and the room is hot and uncomfortable and all we have is a fan!! Finally she moved us to a new room but was very rude to me as if it was my fault the room had a malfunctioning climate control system. We got to bed at 330am and I never want to go back there again.
As a side note, my wife was one of the organizers and it turns out this place also backtracked on some of the contract agreements. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT HOST ANY EVENT HERE!</Text><user_id>117552092108902704539<//user_id><Time>1576102226158< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Our 10 day stay at The Crowne Plaza Palo Alto was like visiting a very loving, happy family. From the front desk to the dining room, poolside service, room service, security and housekeeping, the people who work there are wonderful!  I could live there! Whoever hires and nurtures these employees is a gifted manager. Can’t wait to return in October for my 50th Stanford Reunion!  Big Thank Yous especially to Neeha, Daisy, Jhoana and Jesus just to make a few!< /Review>

Excellent 8 day stay at this exceptionally clean, well lit and exceptionally courteous friendly,helpful staff in all aspects.
All facilities clean and rooms appeared fresh.
Without exception every staff member go above and beyond to make stay comfortable and welcoming.
An emergent situation resolved seamlessly and perfectly due to laser focus, professionalism and caring of staff.
Comfortable beds and EXCELLENT service.<//review>

The rooms are tired and are missing modern options like multiple USB outlets,  The walk to my room was endless. My first room had a broken door which would not lock. Although I’m sure the cleaners do a good job, the rooms ageing appearance looks like it’s not clean.  The air conditioning is loud. 

The bed was comfortable and the in-room service and staff were delightful and helpful. 

In summary the people are good but the facility leaves much to be desired.< /Review>

...ruined what would have been otherwise a delightful stay.
1- Pulled out top dresser drawer to unpack and it came completely out of the frame and dropped on my toes!!! (Yeah, OUCH).
2- Maint could NOT fix TV remote. Could channel DOWN but NOT UP.
3- Paid $15 a day for valet parking that was a JOKE. Every ( and I mean EVERY) night I came back to the Hotel I had to go inside and chase someone down to park my car.</review>

Some properties are really trying to keep the guest experience pleasant and comfortable. This property has the ability to improve the guest experience with limited dining options and bar services but clearly chose not to try unlike their competition just down a block.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I stayed here on a business trip. It wasn't great for that. Probably much better for leisure. Mostly, I need a room with a microwave. When I book a suite, I kind of expect it. I eat most of my dinners in the room, so it's nice to have a way to reheat.

Also, the lightbulb above the toilet gave off a lot of heat. If you told me it was a mixup and it was actually a heat lamp lightbulb from the kitchen, I'd believe you.

The staff were all wonderful people and gave excellent service.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The staff was friendly and professional. The hotel and grounds are very clean and well maintained. The breakfast buffet had a good selection and was good. We had a choice of many hotels in this area and are glad we chose this one. I would stay again without hesitation.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Hotel was at capacity and had to deal with the room I was given.  Room was dark and dingy.  Refrigerator was loud every time it kicked on.  HVAC was also extremely loud as it cycled on/off.  Something with the mattress in the room seemed off as well.  Despite getting a solid 8 hours of sleep, woke up every morning feeling completely exhausted with bloodshot eyes, which has never happened before, when traveling.  Easily the worst travel experience I've ever had.< /Text>

Beautiful lobby with computer with printers - all free to use for guests- surly can make you feel like you home. The room was lovely, super clean with most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! and OMG love they pillows!!!:))) bathroom with shower very clean. Reception was very helpful in directing us to nice pub and club , so we have great night out as well. After we came back - we found out that on every floor there are water stations with bottles so you can take them to the room! also guest request lockers - if we run out of tea, coffee of milk in the room! Its really like they thought of everything to please your stay! I tried food room service as well and in 20 min was delivered to our room! so happy with our stay that acually was sad to leave!</text>

Great place to bring family!  The  Suites were the perfect size and the amenities of the hotel or just what we needed. It’s nice that the hotel is centrally located to many restaurants and stores, and not too far from downtown Palo alto. We will definitely be coming back but looking forward to the bigger suite next time!<//text>

<text>Lovely hotel impressive lobby and friendly staff. We stayed in room 609 and although quite close to elevator it was very quiet as well as being very clean and comfortable. Bar staff were attentive without being imposing and make fabulous vodka martinis. Breakfast was a buffet of a good range of hot and cold foods and bottomless coffee and juice if required. Plenty of self parking as well as a valet service.</text>< pics>

The rooms were extremely comforting and the amenities were quite vast. I didn't get a chance to check out much other than my room, but the bed and bathroom were clean and most importantly the bed was extremely comfortable.<//text>

We stayed in the adjoining building, not the main building. Room was spacious and clean. Beds were comfortable.  Weather was not ideal so did not get to use the pool but it looked nice and was cleaned everyday. Staff was extremely friendly during our stay. Had everything we needed.  Only recommendation would be to have a microwave in the rooms. Did have a fridge and Keurig coffee maker. Would definitely stay again.</Review>

The room was clean and comfortable but I wish there had been better lighting in the main part of the room. Also, I used the portable mirror in the main part of the room but would have preferred a full wall mirror. Everything else about the room was very good.< /review>

My room experienced issues with the heat and instead of your rude technician listening to me as the customer, he insisted that I was wrong.  It took the wonderful lady at the front desk  to come to my room and confirm what I was telling the first technician the entire time!!! (3 hours ago)  The heat was on but was not blowing in order to circulate the heat within the room.  

Resolution- bring me a space heater!  Are you serious?  Crown Plaza should be appalled!  The prompt response should have been to move my room!!< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>None<//rate><text>Staff didn't recognize me as a Spire Ambassador member during check-in, even though I'm a frequent guest, at least 3 times per year. When I asked for late checkout, the front desk staff just say NO, stating the policy is 2pm, and I have to pay extra day if I want to stay later. I can understand they can't offer it if the property is fully booked, but the staff didn't mention it at all. Even when I told her I'm a Spire Ambassador member, she said this is a Crowne Plaza, and not InterContinental, and there is no such benefit to checkout later than 2 pm - which I had experienced in other Crowne Plaza! 
The hotel is OK to stay, as it is close to my work destination, but the staff needs more training.</text>< username>

<Text>Between the military, school and family, I stay at a variety of hotels and resorts from California to Rhode Island... hands down, this has been my favorite and best experience. I tend  to travel a bit bummy after long days.  I’m tired, I know I look tired, but from check-in to check-out I felt like I was wearing a tailored three-piece suit.  Infused water at the front desk, local paper at the elevator, room upgrades (might I add, the new beds were fantastic and the balcony view was exquisite),  and a late and expressed check-out which allowed me to enjoy my non-rushed steak wrap with my kids at the restaurant conveniently located on the ground floor.  To the man who checked us in both evenings (I came back the following night after returning from the boardwalk instead of making the long drive home, worth it) to the woman who served us at the restaurant, this was the quality of service all hotels should try to emulate.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

An amazing place to stay! Really nice pool and really nice gym. The gym is open 24/7 and it has some pretty awesome equipment. The gym had a sauna too that was very spacious! Wonderful new bed in the room. The suite was sweet! Had everything I needed. Had a balcony overlooking the pool area which was very nice!<//Text>

The staff was great and very put going andhelpful.
The only problem we had was with the cleaning staff.
She needed to be able to understand English when we would ask for toilet paper, towels or coffee and cups she had forgotten when they were finished cleaning.
The valets Tom and Jimmy where helpful and very friendly and it was very nice talking with them

 Mary at the front desk and Daisy in the restaurant went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one.
We enjoyed our stay do to the great staff working there.< /text>

Very nice hotel. Stayed there for two nights for a conference. The hotel staff were very polite and helpful and helped in running the conference smoothly. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel.<//Review>

At the price we paid, there are other hotels in the area offering nicer rooms, with complimentary breakfast.  My room was nothing special.  The housekeeping does a fine job.  I found it frustrating each morning to remember that the only breakfast offered is some overpriced buffet that I couldn't justify when all I wanted was some toast before running to the office.<//review>

#1 For no reason, a good portion of parking was kept reserved for paid valet which barely had any cars. For all others not only there is very limited spot but its quite at the back - NOT NICE! You guys definitely don't need to reserve such proportion of your parking for valet!
#2 Extra for overnight parking. Seriously? Are we not already paying enough for the room?
#3 Breakfast not included. ahem! big downside. Although you can pay and have one delivered in your room but its quite expensive and not worth.
#4 Rooms do not have microwave< /review>< pictures>

Great hotel. Good breakfast. Rooms have enough space but are not exceptional.
Low options on cable.
Good outdoor area.<//Text>

The staffs are really welcoming and friendly. They respect your privacy and insist on helping me whenever I need them. 
Just make sure when you’re checkin in with multiple of people, be sure to ask for a number of robes, slippers, and a hair dryer (if need an extra). Also ask for water before coming to your room. I didn’t know there wasn’t any water in the fridge.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Clean and tidy room, well managed. Decent TV and cable connection. you'll have empty mini refrigerator, coffee maker,coffee powder but no drinking water.

In toiletries- no tooth paste, shaving lotion/ cream, but will give u a lot of soaps, shampoo, conditioner etc</review>

Initially, I was disappointed upon check-in. Prior to making the reservation I received confirmation that the hotel would honor a complimentary upgrade to a whirlpool cabana suite, (a benefit of being an elite member) and was reassured it was reserved for me. I frequently book this suite because the whirlpool aids in the treatment of a severed nerve from a leg injury. Upon check in I learned the room was given to another customer and I was assigned to a room without the tub. We had also brought food to save cost because the cabana suite has a mini kitchen.The assigned room did not have a kitchen and I had to make other arrangements to feed my son dinner. It was unsettling. I am a frequent, loyal customer and truly enjoy the property. 
Upon check out, however, Christina, a server in the restaurant, provided exceptional service, apologized for the inconvenience and went out of her way to keep the Sunday buffett brunch open longer so we could eat prior to traveling. I want to express my sincere appreciation for her patience, understanding and professionalism.
Christina made a 3* stay into a 5*. THANK YOU!<//Text>

The room was very spacious and clean! I loved the big tub and the balcony seating area. The bar downstairs was a lot of fun as we were there with family and friends having drinks before and after the wedding reception. The staff was very attentive! I would have to say that overall that it really was the entire hotel staff that made our visit so much fun! The only suggestion that I have is that they remodel their public bathroom on the first floor. It’s dark and dated. Everything else was perfect! Also, the hotel photos don’t do it justice. They really need to update the website.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I expect mediocre conditions when I choose a hotel based on price, but I have observed diminishing conditions during my annual stay here over the last three years that make this hotel a poor choice for a business traveler. Stained curtains, too few healthy menu items, always something wrong with my room, no one picks up room service trays overnight. This year the power went out at 6 am across the whole hotel and there was no effort made to check in with or advise guests. When I checked out at 8:30 am (power still out), no one even mentioned it until I asked what happened! I will say the staff is friendly even if not impressive and the beds are comfortable, so if the power stays on, this hotel is doable for a budget traveler if you don’t need more than that.< /text>

The Crowne Plaza was a great place to stay as I re-visited my old hometown of Palo Alto for my 57th class reunion! My room was on the 8th floor where I had a beautiful view of red tile roofs and the hills with a finger of fog. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows. Bathrobe, slippers and an aromatherapy kit were waiting for me. Room service was prompt and the food was hot on arrival. Lovely experience!< /review>

The entire place is a joke. Especially for the money!! Maids barged in my room TWICE while I was asleep. 7:00 AM and again at 8:15. Food sucks, I was the only one at the restaurant. With three waiters and they still took forever, forgot things. Absolutely ridiculous< /review>

Called back and was then told they do not keep in-house maintenance workers overnight.  Asked for another room and then was told the entire hotel had lost A/C service.  We had to try to sleep unsecured with doors open and temps remained in upper 70s so did not sleep well.  The next morning, the front desk clerk said they were only offering 50% discount to sleep in hot room.  After heated interaction with manager,  that night charges were refunded.  They should have been honest at the beginning so we may still have had option to change to different location.</text>< Pics>

<review>Been to a few events organized here. I wanted to organize one being a marketer myself but they were pricey. I liked their presentation hall options and the lounge type meeting place beside the halls. Parking could be tricky during peak hours. If you want to stay close to some shopping like Safeway, Walmart etc, then this is your place.< /review>< pics>

This place is amazing! Not only is it a beautiful, clean, classy hotel, but the customer service is top notch! Our Daughter frequently goes to Stanford's Children's Hospital and we found this place a few stays ago by chance late in the evening after being discharged from the hospital. The staff upgraded us to a suite, took her food order after the kitchen had been closed, and even brought her some toys the next day (and a football for her brother). The service continued the next trip most recently and they upgraded us to a balcony so my daughter could see the outside as she recovered from her surgery. We are very grateful for this hotel and the great people that work there and will continue to come back!!< /review>

We were hungry and this hotel had a restaurant that was open. I forget what we ate but it took a really long time to get our food. They only had one server for the entire restaurant. The food was ok, but the portions small. The server was very nice and apologetic about the amount of time it took to get our food. Has been my personal experience that hotel food is never very good!<//text>

Decent hotel. Pool is great, bed was comfortable. I've machine was close. It was quiet. Solid 4 star hotel. Only cons were AC couldn't quite get to the temp on the thermostat and the door was super heavy (almost took off my heel) but wouldn't close on it's own.< /Review>

<text>We were in Palo Alto for the PAC 12 track meet and were pleasantly surprised with the accomodations at the Crowne Plaza.  The hotel is older, but has been well maintained and the staff could not have been friendlier.  The rate was very reasonable for the area and we loved that it was located a short distance from restaurants with a Whole Foods market nearby.  We only visited the pool for a short time just to sit outside for some fresh air, but we loved that there are shade cabanas provided for guests at no additional charge.  Parking was plentiful, close, and secure.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

My preferred hotel in the area. Nice pool, gym, lots of parking, decent food (not included), and coffee in the lobby. Only wish they had room safes.< /text>

<review>The great location and excellent staff of the Crowne Plaza make it an almost irresistible hotel. Unfortunately, rates can be high, but during the Thanksgiving week they plummet. We were fortunate to be able to stay there and had a wonderful time. The beds could have been better, but other than that, our room was very nice. The room was clean and quiet. Staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of.</review>< Resp>

<Text>My flight was delayed and upon arrival my room was oversold and I was walked out of the hotel into a motel infront, on the next day when I finally checked in my room AC was not functional and the room smelled bad. When I brought my concerns to the front desk and asked for a different room, I was told to go back into my room and wait for engineering to come and fix the ac because the hotel was sold out. My AC problem was fixed. However the next morning my car had to warning stickers because I was never provided or asked if I needed a parking ticket. upon checking out I was told the system is down and I couldn't not get my receipt which is needed for my job. I was told the receipt would be mailed to me with the email they had in my account but I never received such email.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>If you need to Visit San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay this is a great place to rest and get recharged. I visit all these areas for weekend Trips from Fresno for the attractions and musical instrument shopping. I stayed down the street for less money but not nearly the comfort and luxury. Spend the extra thirty or fifty dollars and get a huge pool , bar and a great breakfast sometimes included in your price. Ask when booking through IHG. Rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. I love the breakfast. It has a great spread and can be sweet or very healthy. The dining room is clean very roomy. The pool! It's big and deep and I can swim laps with no problem. 

What can I say. This is my favorite place to stay In Palo Alto. I have stayed a total or three times and will be back for sure.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Checked in at 4 pm on a. Sunday and was told they only had 1st and 2nd floor rooms available (but not sure they were being honest).  My view is of the HVAC equipment on the roof.  But the room is fairly quiet and the bed is more comfortable than it looks.< /review>< Pics>

For a person who frequently travels to Palo Alto, and has stayed at every hotel in that area, Crowne Plaza is perhaps amongst the best option. It’s larger rooms, ample parking stands out.</text>

The hotel was very nice.  It is showing signs of being a little old.  The Beatles Room was cool.  The meeting was being held there and the service was great.  The food was good but the box lunch for the last day was not good.  The staff was very helpful.< /text>

Hotel is generally nice and good for a business event. However staff was a little slow on the draw regarding ihg membership, room key, emailing invoice, etc. Not a huge thing but the hotel is pricey so you expect these things to be done well.<//text>

<Text>This could be a lovely place to stay if it were fully wheelchair accessible-particularly with rooms among the rest in the hotel, instead of located away down a long, cold, dark corridor and obviously an afterthought in terms of true accessibility.
Although the pool area was closed, it did not appear to have a lift. The finest area did not have accessible gym equipment, the glass doors to the pool area were heavy and did not automatically open.
Staff is friendly; ambience is pleasant.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

After staying in various other hotels in the area, found the Crowne at a reasonable rate and decided to give it a try. 
 Was very impressed with the staff and our room was quiet, spacious, and clean.  Only 5-10 minutes from Stanford and well worth the money.  This will be the hotel we'll stay at from now on.</review>

We attended a fundraiser event in the main hall. There is a nice area outside the room to receive guests. The main hall is a nice size and could accommodate upto 400 guests. The event we attended was decorated by a company call Elegantly Done Decor, they did an excellent job. This is a great hotel for events like this.</Review>

The room was clean and comfortable. The selection of snacks were much more vast than other IHG locations that I’ve been to.

Everything was great but I did forget to mention that the breakfast buffet was not very warm at all. Good selection, just cold. From the eggs to the waffles.</Review></record>

Place was so nice. The group I was with contemplated not leaving and driving the extra 45 mins for one more night here. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious. This hotel has tiny thoughtful perks in the room, like slippers and spa like lotions. So impressed. My room was poolside and had an adorable patio looking out to the pool. Sad I was unable to enjoy the property for another night.< /review>

The kitchen was a bit slow but nothing to seriously complain about.
I enjoyed my stay. Thanks to all the staff.< /Text>< user_name>

The main building you see upon arrival looks nice and like a regular type of hotel. But ... if you book a "Cabana" type room, these rooms are more like a motel type of setting. My stay was in the "Cabana" room. Very nice if you like to hear noise from the pool area; even with the window closed.

My suggestion ... do your research thoroughly before booking a room here to make sure it's they type of room you are expecting.</review>

Traveled for a few days on business. Got a nice room on the 2nd floor and had a great experience. Top notch exercise facility and grounds are very nice.  Free coffee in the lobby was a bonus. Restaurant was good with good service.<//Text>

Thank you Sergio at the front!!  He was the first person to initiate the start to an amazing experience at your hotel.  He went above and beyond to make sure everything was put together for me.
Restaurant had great food and my service was memorable.  Thank you an excellent stay.
Elliott and Rose were very helpful in making this a great stay as well.< /Review>

The hotel needs some updates/renovations. Overall it was clean and the printer worked when I needed it. 
The outdoor patio and pool are beautiful and parking is very easy. My room was on the first floor by the parking lot and it was a bit noisy. 
I paid over $400 for my room and do expect to have tissues and bottled water at this price.< /text>

<name>Becca Abbott-McCune< /name><Review>I stayed here with many people for a conference. The breakfast was good and had lots of options to choose from. There are many conference rooms available for meetings and the like, with various sized tables available. This is a comfortable cozy hotel with good sized rooms. Appliance rentals were available for those that didn’t get a room with them, and there was a mini store for late night snacks. The seating and spiral staircase are beautiful. The hotel has plenty of space to host events and lots of parking for guests and busses. Part of the hotel is indoors and part of it is outdoors, and there are different style rooms in each. A grand piano in the main foyer provides a wonderful sound and is open to anyone to play. You can hear some lovely notes as people stop by. Overall a good place to stay.</Review>< user_id>

<response>None<//response><review>My flight was delayed and upon arrival my room was oversold and I was walked out of the hotel into a motel infront, on the next day when I finally checked in my room AC was not functional and the room smelled bad. When I brought my concerns to the front desk and asked for a different room, I was told to go back into my room and wait for engineering to come and fix the ac because the hotel was sold out. My AC problem was fixed. However the next morning my car had to warning stickers because I was never provided or asked if I needed a parking ticket. upon checking out I was told the system is down and I couldn't not get my receipt which is needed for my job. I was told the receipt would be mailed to me with the email they had in my account but I never received such email. Overall the motel I stayed was 10x better than paying 500 a night for a Crowne plaza. I wish I could give this hotel a 0/5 stars< /review><user>113521841473656782749< /user>< Rating>

<text>Great pool area! Cabana rooms have a relaxing patio area facing the pool. The rooms are a little dated but the bed is comfy. Didn't get much sleep because people across the pool were talking all night long! We called the front desk and they said someone would check it out but it was loud until about 3am. Other than that, it was a nice stay.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This hotel is very nice and spacious. Staff is top notch and made my family(three little kids) fill like royalty. The one negative was that I booked a room with pool side access but all that was available was a room with a pool side view. Front desk took care of me though.< /review>

We were very pleased with the Crowne Plaza, Palo Alto, CA.  It is a beautiful complex and very up-to-date.  Fruit flavored water and fruit are offered in the lobby.  The rooms are large.  WIFI is included and excellent.  Everyone we dealt with were friendly and helpful.  I thought the valet parking was very reasonable.  The pool area was very nice, but we did not have time to use it.  The hotel is well situated to many things in the area and many good restaurants on all monetary levels are within walking distance.< /Review>

I had checked in late in the evening and it was a long drive and I was already tired but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful! I got a great room, and a nice view of the area in the front of the hotel. Everyone I met at the hotel was very friendly, and all the facilities were clean and in good condition. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone visiting the area.</review>

I had to find a Hotel that was close to train and bus as my son had to travel from north and I had to go south for airport in morning, it was an excellent choice.  The room was very clean and had all the best of soaps and shampoo, etc.  The Hotel Staff was excellent and very happy and fun!  We spent time in the lounge with great conversation from the Bar Tender and others, it was pretty deserted because of the holiday, so that was a plus.  When requesting any kind of help, they were right there for us, with directions, working the coffee machine and other stuff.  I would definitely go there again for the location and the warm friendly staff.  I rate this place  as Excellent.<//Text>

This hotel was very accommodating.  We had a small private patio outside our room surrounding by lush plants.  The extra touches like the aromatherapy package were very enjoyable and helpful.  We appreciated the information give at check-in about the history of the hotel.  Loved having water available and morning coffee.  Free parking!  We didn't bring a dog, but the hotel has a nice little area for our furry friends.  The pool and spa was clean and spacious. A great stay!< /Text>

Our stay was great except the AC didn’t work near as well as it should because our room ever got below 73 and was very humid. The staff was also very accommodating after we had to leave our previous hotel(HIE Sunnyvale) we had reserved had rooms I couldn’t even drive my wheelchair into. The CP room had plenty of room to drive my wheelchair around in but there was little ramp/step into the bathroom that kept tripping eoolevwalking into the bathroom.< /Review>

<Review>This hotel has a touch of class. I was exhausted upon entering the hotel. Wasn't sure where to park but we came through the lobby and went up to check in. Check in was easy. My boyfriend was still hungry and ended up buying a soup. Unfortunately, there was no place to heat it up although I think he eventually found something. I came up and unpacked. Jumped in the shower and got ready to relax. I noticed the eucalyptus package of spray and massage creme, How nice, I thought. I sprayed the pillow and decided to play a little music. The music was all so relaxing. Unusual and just what I needed. My boyfriend jumped in the shower. I was so thrilled to have the massage creme. I was able to use the massage creme to rub his back and feet and off to sleep we went. It was really nice. A wonderful treat. The next day I took my time and went down for breakfast. I'm looking for a place to live in the area. I also had lunch the next day and invited a friend. We loved the food and the service was excellent. The room was so relaxing and I loved the little room where the Christmas tree was by the television although I wasn't able to sit there. All you need is a fire pit outside and a couple of nice chairs to lounge in. My only suggestion is to buy a couple of new flags outside. they were all ripped. I loved this hotel and my guest room was beautifully decorated in warm colors. If you had more television stations that would be even better. I loved my stay and will definitely be back! I'm planning a trip in February 2016 and I've already recommended this hotel to a friend of mine. Thank you for making this trip so nice. It is a great memory of an early Christmas in 2015! Happy New Year! Jill< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Best Hotel around! I stay here for business probably about 20 times per year. The Hotel is nice although the rooms are due for an update they are large and spacious. Beds and Pillows are comfortable and the hotel is conveniently located to all. Staff is the best in town, friendly and welcoming and willing to help you with whatever you need. Place is a little dated but kept spotless! Hot coffee every morning and wine and cheese every evening in the lobby.< /Review>< Pics>

Food is over priced so be aware, but quite good.  We will go back some other day.  Charles at front desk is top notch.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The staff was friendly and helped us in every area. Our room was amazing and the service for breakfast was A+ quality! Thank you for a lovely stay!
We only stayed one night. If we stayed a second night we would have had housekeeping come and clean the tile floors. However, other than that it was perfect!</Review>

<Text>This hotel was very nice. They had a very nice looking restaraunt and patio area. They also had a lounge area where we waited to check in since we arrived early. The room was very clean and spacious. We got the king sized bed and it was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. The location was on a major street but actually located far enough from the traffic so we were not bothered by noise at all. Overall the service was great. They also had a self service checkout with drinks, snacks, and some toiletries. I would stay here again.<//Text>< Pictures>

The staff here is amazing, always smiling and will make sure you are taken care of. I can't name them all but from the front desk, to the bar/kitchen, to the shuttle driver, and the housekeepers they have all been very accommodating. The rooms are quiet and kept clean. I have been in and out of the Crowne Plaza for approximately the past 6 months and have no complaints. I will definitely be back to this hotel when I am back in the area.< /Review>

<review>Parking was easy. Check was friendly and fast. When we went to our room  maintenance working in the room working . But the front desk moved us to a different room quick and easy. The overall room was clean and nice. Furniture had a few condition issues and the mattress wasn't very comfortable. The sheets and blankets where stiff and not very soft almost scratchy like and over starched dress shirt. The overall service was great and I wont let something like bed sheets keep me from returning.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I visited here to pick up work friends and was greeted with free afternoon wine and cheese. The atmosphere was certainly welcoming and while I didn't stay here, I felt like part of the VIP guest list.

The hotel location is good.
Building and facility are well maintained.
The bed is very good.
Room size is good.

However, the front desk assigned the room right next the pump, very unhappy with that.<//text>

I stayed at this Crowne Plaza for a holiday visit with my daughter and other family members. I picked this hotel because of the special rate I got and because I was familiar with the property. My room was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. The breakfasts in the restaurant were very good. But I was most impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone on the staff with whom I had any contact.<//Text>

Pros:
Staff was attentive.
Rooms were clean.
Front desk staff were very accommodating.
Gym was clean.
Parking was ample

Cons
Pool could use some upgrading (didn't look appetizing)
Free Happy hour was some how cancelled all week
Breakfast was slightly expensive at $18</Text>

This was intermittent at best, very slow and nonexistent at times. iPhones worked but Mac computer was very poor. 
Pool was a huge benefit even though it is not heated. Entry gate non functioning at times. Occasionally towels were not available. Could do with the Terrace being cleaned regularly as many guests walk around it in shoes so it always looks grubby. 
Overall it is very good value and most of the staff very helpful and pleasant. 
We look forward to a repeat visit next year.<//text>

This hotel is in a great location. It is very close to Stanford. The front desk staff was average. I had asked to be put on a waitlist for their shiuttlw service the next morning since it was completely booked. I then specifically asked to be notified either way regardless. No one called. I also called and requested a taxi be summoned. The person with whom I was speaking seemed to be inconvenienced by this request, and didn’t seem interested in helping. Also, when I went down to the front desk at 9am there was literally NO ONE there. Very disappointing. The shuttle driver named Steve is AWESOME. He is very knowledgeable about the area, and was very helpful and professional.</Review>

I can't say enough good things about this property, especially about the kind folks on the staff. My daughter and I have been traveling 2 hours from home every two weeks to Stanford in Palo Alto for her Chemo treatments. We always try to stay at the Crowne. All of the employees have been very helpful and caring - Rose Marie, Gervin, Mary, Elliott and Javier to name a few! The hotel is clean and bright, the food in the restaurant is great and rooms by the pool are beautiful. Thanks for always making us feel welcome!< /Text>

The room looks nice. But the design that the window is facing the corridor is arguable. The property looks good from outside, and it locates in a quite good location.

The front desk staff could have been warmer and more passionate upon checking in. Not only the front desk staff didn't greet me and acknowledge me as an IHG member, the staff didn't even return my greeting. I found the check-in experience is the worst among the IHG property I have ever stayed.

The housekeeping service should have checked the connection of the lamp and the clock in the room. I had to struggle and plug them in by myself.<//Review>

I stay at many hotels during the course of any year and I can honestly say I have never experienced such a positive team spirit at any of them compared to this Crowne Plaza. From top to bottom nothing was too much trouble and the little touches like the free local transport and wine and cheese sessions made the hotel a delight to stay at.
I can't comment on the restaurant as we mostly enjoyed the many local facilities; but the breakfasts were good.
I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the Palo Alto or Mountain View area.</review>

<Review>The history of the Palo Alto Crowne Plaza made it even more interesting to stay ( originally the Cabana built by Doris Day). It is centrally located on the main street in Palo Alto, so getting around was easy. The staff was some of the most accommodating hospitality personnel I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I was there due to a parent's extended stay at Stanford Medical Center. They asked about my parent daily and showed genuine concern for her. I had to return twice and each time they provided superior service to help me book my stay.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</gmap_id></record>

I was surprised at how fast room service was, and how excellent the food was that was delivered to my room.

I always like the ambiance here; the lobby, the lighting, the morning coffee in the lobby.  

The room was quiet, bed excellent, it's always a pleasure to stay at this hotel.  I do strongly prefer to stay "in the tower."<//text>

I stayed here two nights on a business trip.  The staff were exceedingly courteous and kind. I enjoyed their wine and cheese tasting in the evening, and loved that they had water available throughout the day in the lobby.   The grounds were lovely and my room comfortable.  However, the bed was very firm (okay if you like that), and the room could use some maintenance.  But other than that - very comfortable and well-appointed.  The breakfast buffet was solidly good - lots of fresh fruit, oatmeal with lots of options for toppings, bacon, eggs, pancakes/french toast, various pastries.  Nice, but not extravagant.  Overall - I felt the price was a bit high for what I got - however, all the hotels were quite expensive in the area at this time.</text>

The staff is the bright spot for this hotel.  Everyone was friendly and very helpful.  Our room was poolside and made it very convenient for my boys.  We were in town for a football camp and the pool at the end of the day was welcomed.  The disappointment was that the hot tub was dirty both evenings we tried to enjoy it.  Ricky in the restaurant was attentive and served us a wonderful meal.  Overall it was an enjoyable stay.< /text>

<review>We used IHG Reward Points to make a long weekend out of attending San Francisco Symphony's performance at the Shoreline Amphie Theater.
The hotel location is ideal for this, but do not drive there! Traffic management is on 3rd world level.Take a taxi or Uber.
The hotel is nice. Rooms and common areas look fresh and recently renovated - except for the carpet.
Staff and service is exellent. Self-parking is unusually convenient.<//review>< Rate>

<Review>In staying at this hotel, I had to wait for the room to be cleaned before I could check in. I waited 45 minutes for this and that was in the early evening past the time to be able to check in. One of the drawers in the room, there were clothes left by previous customer I assume?  Or could someone still be staying in that room? I don't know. The room was noisy as it was right on the HVAC system for the hotel. The morning of departure I had to wait for my final bill.  It was not put under the door in the morning.  
Not a pleasant experience overall.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>Lovely room, and the bed was amazing, especially the sheets!  The carpet was very stained and gross-looking, however.  The bathroom had really dim lighting, and the noise from the pool area was disruptive till about 2am.<//Text>< pictures>

Considering this is a Cabana Hotel, the pool and hot tub were poorly taken care of. Upon arrival, the hot tub was filled with small children jumping in and out with large floaties, disrupting the peace. We left the hot tub and returned later only to find that it was completely disgusting. The water was a greenish color and it had lots of gross things floating inside of it. I cleaned it out myself but was still disgusted with the fact that the water’s color was off. Definitely disappointed with the fact that the staff didn’t do anything about the children making a mess and playing around in the hot tub. On top of that, we waited 30 minutes for the staff to bring towels to the pool area. We didn’t want to get the inside of the hotel wet, and that’s why that, out of respect for the staff, we had waited for so long. The upkeep outside wasn’t great either.. A large branch from a tree that was in the parking lot had fallen onto someone’s car. My family’s overall experience wasn’t that great. The rooms were nice but Crowne Plaza needs to get the rest of their business in order.</review>

The quality of the mattress, sheets and pillows helped with my comfort.
Some additional benefits:
A refrigerator,
Aromatherapy sleep aids,
great water pressure and shower head.
The room was very quiet.
There was an easy to use thermostat,
no off odors,
magnifying makeup mirror.
Newspaper delivery in the morning on my doorstep.
I really enjoyed my stay and will return in the future.<//text><GmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. We were greeted by the front desk as soon as we walked through the door. The room was clean and comfortable. The bar closed early (by our standards) at 11:00pm. We thought they might be open longer as we were a large group staying there. We will definitely stay there again.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Many friends and family stayed here for our wedding nearby. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating for our big groups. We had our rehearsal dinner at th Crowne Plaza and the food was fantastic!
The hotel and their entire staff treated us all very well and made it a great place for all of us to be together. 
It was very clean and I only wish I had time to hang out by the nice pool!</review>

<review>If you need somewhere to stay close to Stanford University, this is it. Great central  location in Palo Alto. Read some of the negative reviews about their customer service and almost didn't book a room here. I am glad we did though because our experience at this hotel was exceptional. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us in every aspect of our stay. I would definitely stay here again in the future. Also , it's listed as a pet friendly hotel but you wouldn't know it because the grounds are kept clean.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1520899200000<//Time><Name>GnG2112</Name>< gmapID>

This hotel created a wonderful atmosphere for our class reunion as it is a classy hotel. The desk staff and the bellman were genuinely friendly...more so that most hotels I've stayed at. They all really made me feel important and comfortable. The room was excellent in all the right ways: cleanliness, amenities in the bathroom, quiet, great bed, bathrobe, slippers. The pool is huge with lots of lounging chairs. They have a nice bar, and for our group's meal, it was over the top with gourmet food. Everyone was amazed at the quality and choice of the food buffet. Excellent! Wonderful stay!<//Review>

I was in Palo Alto for a conference at Stanford. It was farther from the campus than I would have liked (about a 15-20 minute drive) but was fairly reasonably priced at the group conference rate. The front desk staff were all very nice and helpful. I was upgraded to a larger room but was charged the rate I had reserved. I had originally requested a room with 2 queen beds because a friend was going to share the room but when they decided against the trip, there were no single king bed room (with lower rate) left. The room was clean and comfortable. The towels were fluffy and white.< /text>

Thank you so much for giving us a beautiful, incredibly affordable space with a view to celebrate many many months of stress. We’ve been renovating and selling an investment property, buying our own house, dealing with Taxes and the IRS, and both working out-of-State half the time. We also have 2 babies under 3 years of age. 

My employer didn’t let me off the floor to attend our work event until very late. But your beautiful hotel, ice cold mini-fridge, and accommodating staff more than made up for the stress of getting there. Breakfast-in-bed and a quiet morning topped of our stay and left us content and rejuvenated. Time to go move into our new house. It was so lovely to be the one being taken care of for a change. Thank You so much</Text>

<review>The location is very good. The hotel has a nice setting for events like wedding or other banquet functions. Either pool side event or the banquet and dancing hall. The room is roomy. But in my suite of over 1,000- ft, I am surprised to see there is only a queen size bed and not King size !<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>This Crowne Plaza is a very nice facility.  I am a Spire member; however, I was not able to be with my 25-year-old daughter initially when she checked in.  As soon as the woman checking my daughter in realized she was not the Spire member, her entire demeanor changed, like my daughter was some lowly person.  This left a bad taste in both of our mouths for our five night stay.

The gentleman at check-out almost made up for it.  He was wonderful, gracious, and friendly>

A couple of other things:  the internet did not work for the first 36 hours, and the walls are a bit thin, as I could hear people in the room next door.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The room was comfortable and clean.  However, the toilet had a fecal stench even though it had not been used.  Could be from a plumbing leak.</review>

When making the reservation, we chose the "Poolside cabana Kingsize" room, which on the website was the only room with no photo available. These rooms appear to be in the oldest part of the hotel, and are showing some signs of age. Most importantly, I would expect a "Poolside cabana" room to have access to the pool. This is NOT the case. There is a tiny patio where you can see the pool, and a giant Iron railing that prevents one from getting to the pool area; hence one must exit into the hallway, walk all of the way to the end of the wing, into the hotel lobby then back out and again around another 100 feet to get to the pool. Having recent back surgery i thought the spa might be nice, but the foot travel to get there and back prevented me from attempting to use it.</text>

<Review>The hotel's conference facilities are top notch. The space is well contained and well furnished. The staff is friendly, accommodating, and attentive. The hotel rooms, on the other hand, while clean, are oddly laid out. While the furniture is adequate, they seem weirdly mismatched. Some parts of the room are shabby. For example, the closet door in my room was broken and splintered in the corners.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This hotel was great all around! Very clean, put together well, great comfy beds, staff very friendly. Great experience!

The only issue I had was the fact that parking in your hotel cost extra money, that put me off and makes no sense to me why one would have to pay additional money to park in the hotel they are staying and paying for, it is ludacris to me. Just include the "cost" of parking to be reflected in the room / service and dont mention there is a parking cost. The fact there is a separate cost is ridiculous and is unnecessary.

Thankfully your front desk was nice enough to sign me up for rewards so I got the parking this time free. 

Honestly if there is an additional cost for parking I would not stay here again on principal...if the room stay is $12 more I would not care,  whatever the cost for the room is doesnt matter, its the fact there is an extra charge for parking just rubs me the wrong way...sorry for seeming crazy because I'm harping on this but it's just how I'm wired I guess.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>We reserved a block of rooms a year in advance for our out-of-town guests at great rate for our reunion weekend. The Friday night reception was held in the courtyard with appetizers and cash bar. The weekend stay and the reception were both perfect. The patio space was beautiful for gathering with old friends and got our weekend off to a great start. Other activities were held on the Stanford campus but the hotel was home base. The guests were also very pleased with the shuttle service available to get them to their weekend activities.
I live in Palo Alto so didn't actually need a room but we stayed at the hotel anyway and were very glad that we did!<//review><username>NancyCCC</username><Rate>None<//Rate>< pics>

This hotel is nice and functional.  I think there are hotels with more character in the Palo Alto area.  The newer rooms surrounding the pool are very nice and modern, but the older ones on upper floors in the tower are not nearly as well appointed.  Get a garden view room if you can.<//Review>

This hotel is great. It's my first time in Palo Alto, so I don't know how to compare to places nearby, but compared to many of the hotels I've stayed at for business this one ranks way up there. The breakfast was delicious and nutritious. The room I was more than big enough and the bed was king sized and very comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here and hope to do so again.< /Text>

I have visited numerous other hotels and pets are welcomed wherever we are willing to pay for accomodations. I do not feel that this hotel is "pet-friendly" but "willing to accept pets on their own terms." In addition, I was not told that there was a $50 one-time fee for my dog. I have never been charged (even at homeaway/vrbo rentals) such an exorbitant fee for a one-night stay.

I do not recommend this hotel as pet-friendly.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Fun fact: the Beatles stayed there during their British Invasion tour.  It's not run down but it feels antiquated, especially for the high price they charge for rooms. The staff is nice and professional. 

Unfortunately, I found a big hair in my shower and missed not having any counter space. They did offer a robe, a comfortable bed with good pillows, a gym and a restaurant and a breakfast bar. The basics were there but it was pricey.< /Text><Date>1522022400000< /Date>< Name>

<Review>The overall experience of our stay was very good.  I especially appreciated the infused water available in the front lobby. Would have appreciated a larger cup to be able to take it back to the room to enjoy.  The coffee in the lobby was a good surprise and was very good.  

Staff was very considerate and helpful.  We also enjoyed relaxing in the spa and pool.</Review>< userid>

Excellent front desk check is was fast and staff was so polite 
The first room 175 had terribly dirty deck was filthy table and chairs filled with dirt, dust ,big spiders that I'm allergic to and spider webs all over deck including a huge web with fat ugly spider that i 
Almost walked into....sun was going down and you really could charge spiders in hair and hotel maintanence was obviously not important bot this property it appeared all decks under oak trees had same problem 

However front desk promptly moved us to room 170 which was beautiful located away next to pool and clean deck with no trees and no spiders....

Huge wedding that night was beautiful how hotel turned this lobby into beautiful venue for guest in wedding party and also made all guests feel special 

By far front desk was on it and catered to all guests 
I was extremely impressed also the dining room and breakfast was high quality band service excellent 

Thank you before making our stay so memorable</review>

Great hotel. Short Uber drive to town do Pali Alto. 
Room very comfortable. Nice bathroom and toiletries, even a relax pack. Bathrobes supplied. 
Breakfast was very good, even though we were in a temporary room on both occasions. . Fruit , croissants and quite a few hot options. Lovely staff , very helpful. Especially as I am on a gluten free diet. 
Didn't use the pool as there was a wedding on and it seemed busy. But other people said it was lovely. 
Nice welcoming supply of water with fruit in at reception, plus coffee
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. Very satisfied</Text>

<Review>The staff at this hotel are so friendly and helpful. They greeted me each morning and afternoon. The valet remembered my name and my car, so I didn't have to wait - he went to get it as he saw me coming. The room was surprisingly nice. The aromatherapy for nighttime was an extra treat! The only thing missing was counter space in the bathroom, but there was a nice shelving unit for use. Overall, a great place in the heart of Palo Alto.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I came to this hotel for a wedding and it was recommended by the family. I am so glad I took their advice. The hotel was easy to find, everyone was very helpful and polite. My room was clean and ready early for me, inviting with all the amenities readily available in my room. The room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable.
I was well rested and ready for all the wedding activities during my stay.
Thank you Crowne Plaza!<//text>

Very nice lobby and hotel grounds with a bat and made to order restaurant. The staff was friendly and there were great. Nice options for runners to get out and explore the area. The bathroom was well appointed and spacious, but the sheets and pillowcases were a little on the rough side. Definitely a nice property.<//Text>

I like the reliably good service at Crowne Plaza Hotels.  I wish they had better vegetarian choices from room service.  I had an amazing veggie burger at the Crowne Plaza in Chicago and great breakfast choices at the one in Santa Clara.  The staff here didn't seem to understand what a veggie burger was!  
Still, I like this hotel chain and would stay again and staff did direct me to a nearby 24 hour grocery store that had a decent selection of food to take out.</Review>

<Text>Breakfast was the highlight of my stay.  The buffet was fresh and well-supplied.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is great, and the staff are attentive.

If my room had a better mattress, I'd probably give more top level ratings to this hotel.  A good night's sleep is essential during business travel, and it was the only thing really missing.  Perhaps it was just in my room, but the mattress sank too far and felt like it may have been older.  The linens were fine though, and the lighting was adequate to work at the desk.

There was also a guest wine< /Text>< resp>

I usually start at a Marriott and there's a reason why. I have a usual preference on rooms and this place didn't deliver. The beds aren't that comfortable which made my night rough. Next morning I realized I forgot my toothbrush and was charged $3 for a toothbrush which I normally get free. I'll see how these next 2 days go but so far not impressed.

(Edit)

Lowering score to 1 from 3 because the stay seemed to of gotten worse the longer I was there. Going back to my hotel room the door wouldn't lock. I called the front desk and it took maintenance close to an hour to fix it. I was in a slight rush to get to San Francisco before the sun went down but made it after the sun went down. I'll make a better choice next time.< /Text>

<text>I had stayed in several Crowne Plaza hotels hence when I thought of a hotel to go to with my husband for our 10th year anniversary, this was what I suggested. The experience was okay and I really appreciated the kindness and attention to detail of one of the waiters at the dining. However on our last morning, my husband and I got down around 10am for breakfast and we were told breakfast was over, it was time for brunch and we will have to pay for the brunch (breakfast was included in our reservation). The employees at the dining area did well to explain to me and said I was supposed to have been told at the time of check in. They offered to refund us $2 for the breakfast and to pay for only 1 person's meal for the brunch but since my husband and I were not yet ready for something heavy, we decided to proceed with our plans for the morning. 

Upon check out I spoke to a lady at the frontdesk and she said two things that shocked me. First of all that she was sure that the person who checked me in must have told me about the rules of breakfast and secondly if I did not get it, either I was not listening or my mind was not there. I found it very rude that an employee at the frontdesk could make such a statement to a customer. She was not there when I was checked in hence she cannot conclude that the person who checked me in indeed told me (and my husband) about the rules of breakfast. To even suggest that I was either not listening or my mind was not there was even worse because both my husband and I can verify that the person who checked us in did not mention anything about breakfast.

I have always enjoyed my experience at Crowne Plaza hotels but this experience has made me reconsider whether I will use personal funds for a future stay at Crowne Plaza hotels.

My recommendations however will be:-
1. Let employees be retrained on customer service. One of the waiters is a fantastic example of how people should treat customers.
2. Have hardcopy information about the rules of breakfast somewhere such that if those at the frontdesk miss it, guests can read about it in their rooms or somewhere else.<//text>< Pics>

Good location. Easy to get in and out. . 

We especially like the grounds and ease of parking.
Easy access to room. For the first time I actually do not mind to stay at the ground floor. I find the queen room with two queen beds facing pool side is surprisingly pleasant. Clean room and comfortable beds with clean sheets and pillows.

The restaurant is fair but the service is good. Food is average.

Will definitely stay here again.</review>< rating>

Great staff! They made things really easy for me. A few days before check in, I called and was able to switch the rooms that I booked from the king bed to two queen beds. During our stay, our requests (extra pillows, bags, etc.) were quickly seen to as well. The rooms were clean and spacious! Would definitely stay here again!<//Review>

<Text>I went to a real estate seminar here and I was impressed with their lounge area. I returned back the next week to meet one of the seminar participants to discuss real estate. We both agreed it was a very convenient location for meetings. The parking is free. They have great coffee service you can order from the tablets. They have tv monitors in the back if you want to watch sports.  They also have a business conference room in the front. If you haven't been, I actually recommend just stopping by to see for yourself. It's a nice, modern hotel lobby.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Rooms behind the pool all have french doors that open up to lawn area. This worked great for our large family wedding, keeping us all connected by the lawn and giving the kids a place to run. Rooms were clean, updated, and comfortable. Grounds were pretty. No complaints. Got a great group rate, so the value for what we paid was very good. Staff was friendly. Only thing we were not told was that they have mandatory parking fee of $12. But parking was easy and convenient - could get close to your room.</Text>< pics>

The customer service was excellent and the management taking care of our reservations and room blocks was very attentive and always followed up with any changes made. The suite they gave us for the bridal suite was beautiful. I was able to get photos taken inside the room while getting ready the morning of my wedding.

The stay was short but comfortable. The staff was very courteous and checkin was expedient.
Given future trips, I would highly recommend this Crowne Plaza to any IHG rewards members and people looking to stay at IHG hotels.
I did not have a chance to try the pool or fitness center area but on passing glance it was clean and well-maintained.< /Review>

<text>From check in to time we left, staff at this location were always very positive.

We were attending a conference at the hotel and the staff handling the lunch buffet were exceptionally courteous, efficient, and attentive.

At the end of the stay, the front desk arranged to have a driver pick us up for San Jose airport which was so much better than the random taxi on the way in.

Overall staff at this location were most genuinely friendly and helpful of any place we've stayed in this chain.

Also helpful was map of area trail for walking.<//text>< user_name>

Reported problem on in-room Jacuzzi in late afternoon, came back to hotel after dinner, front desk claimed it is fixed, but it wasn't. Call front desk, engineer came, but have no idea how to fix as the main engineer left for the day.  He promised it will be fixed next day. In the next morning, front desk call and just say 600 points has been credited to my account for the inconvenient - no explanation. By the evening, it still wasn't fixed, call engineering, they couldn't fix it, need to have day-time engineer to come fix it next day. but have to check out next day. Could not enjoy the Jacuzzi, very disappointed. 
Came back the following week, they put me in another room with Jacuzzi, this one works.<//text>

< Review>
I'm not a big hotel person because I am very picky when it comes to cleanliness.  This hotel was probably the BEST experience I have ever had in hotels. There was nothing I could say that was wrong with my stay here.


Unfortunately I was not there for business or pleasure.  Palo Alto is home of Stanford Medical Center, so I was staying at Crowne Plaza while my mother was battling for her life. It was a huge comfort to come back to the hotel after my long days at the hospital.

The staff in this hotel went above and beyond their duties to make sure I was comfortable.  Everywhere I went I was met with a caring face.  From the courtesy shuttle to and from the hospital, to the food service, bar and lounge  It was all excellent!
There was one particular individual and I wish I would have gotten her name. She would greet me every morning as the host of the food lounge.  She read my body language and knew something was wrong.  She stayed with me at the table while I cried and didn't leave my side until she felt I was ok.  Now thats an angel!  I don't know if I will ever see her again, but I would really like her to know the impact she had on me that morning.  My mother died the next day.

This entire hotel employs quality people who really care.  I can't say enough about my stay here. I would definitely come and stay here again.</Review>

<Review>What stood out the most is the excellent service the front desk staff provided. As well as the excellent bedding in the room. By far one of the best nights sleep I’ve had.

I have stayed at this property twice now when visiting Palo Alto and love it! It is located very close to downtown Palo Alto and is a short drive to all of the attractions there. It was also biking friendly and very accessible to Stanford University. The staff are friendly and helpful; the restaurant was excellent and had great quality food; the room was very comfortable (although the rooms are a bit small); the bathroom was VERY nice and included nice amenities for a relaxing weekend trip. I cannot say enough great things about it and would definitely stay there again when business brings me back to Palo Alto.< /text>

<Text>The Crowne Plaza was known as the Cabana Hotel in 1965 when the Beatles stayed on the 8th floor for their concert at the Cow Palace.  We got upgraded to their room filled with memorabilia.

Need to clean or get better shower heads; half of the holes sprayed sideways.  The drawers in dresser did not close properly which made accessing the refrigerator difficult.  The maid service did not replenish toiletries or replace used glasses.  Paying $12 for parking when it is free at every other business hotel in the area is annoying.  The shuttle driver Steve never answered or returned phone calls for pickup.  The air conditioning vent in the room was filthy (which is probably why it was so loud).  No televisions in the fitness center, and the water rowing machine was overfilled with water.  Check-in for 3 rooms on the same booking and credit card took way too long considering there was no one else waiting.</review>

<Text>The hotel provides a high quality, comfortable, and quiet environment in the heart of Palo Alto California. Service was definitely friendly and caring. The dining room provided quality food at a reasonable price -- not the typical "Hotel Chain" menu and the staff was very accommodating. Internet connectivity was excellent. I recommend this particular Crowne Plaza and will plan on staying there on my next visit.<//Text>< pictures>

Kind of a cross between a motel and a hotel, this place is a bit of a labyrinth, it can take up to 10 min walking to get to your room from the elevator. Rooms are fairly basic.</text>

Although I have passed by this hotel many times in the last 20 years, this was my first stay to try it out. The hotel is more impressive than it's outside look. As a platinum member, I received a suite upgrade which is very spacious and quiet. The room and lobby are well lighted and in good condition. I will definitely come back again next time.< /Review>

Super friendly staff, especially Steve who remembers who I am each time. Room on ground floor opens to a small priavte courtyard by the pool so you don't feel couped up like other hotels. Great bar and restaurant. Monday's there's food trucks and music out front, so solo travelers like me can socialise.< /Review>

The Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto is very suitable for people who want to visit this area and stay. Compare to other hotels, it is inexpensive but still have clean room and option dinning. I spend much time during the day, so I don't use other luxury amenities. A clean room is good for me.< /review>

I stayed one night and had a tower room. It was pleasant and up-to-date. The bed was very comfortable and the towels were cushy. My room had a lovely view of the pool in the foreground and the hills in the distance.

The staff were all very helpful and friendly. I needed something at a grocery store and not only did they direct me they suggested I could use the shuttle driver to take me there.<//review>

The pool-side rooms have nice patio seating, and the many common areas provide ample opportunity to relax or conduct work out-of-the-room. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet. The restaurant menu was excellent, although a bit pricey. Overnight parking is valet only, and an added although reasonable priced fee.<//Review><response>None< /response><Pictures>None</Pictures><date>1430870400000< /date></record></dataset><record>

<text>I had a pleasant stay and the only two less than glowing comments I have is that there was a long wait at 1:00 pm for a drink by the pool. It was a busy Saturday, staff apologized, but if they had told me they were that busy I would have gone an got the drink myself. 

I also did not like the glass bathroom doors. I prefer more privacy although the doors do allow more light.

The room was clean, comfortable, had a nice sized refrigerator. I had a wonderful stay.< /text>< pictures>

The Grich that stole Christmas. We had our Christmas party here, everything was fine until... out of a party of 15 EVERYONE became sick except the one woman allergic to sea food. It tastes Good, but who wants to spend Christmas on the throne? It's a shame, we've been going there for years, but this will be the last time. DO NOT RECOMMEND.< /Review>

The room was spacious and clean, the food in the restaurant was excellent and the drinks were made perfectly. I had a Manhattan while sitting at the bar and the bartender knew exactly how to make it. I couldn't believe how friendly everyone was!

I understand this hotel was opened back in the early 1960's and it still has that vintage charm that's all the rage now. I highly recommend this hotel, I know you'll love it too!< /Text>< pictures>

Wish you had a free breakfast and the parking fee was not indicated on the site I booked on. At least I did not notice that until I got to the hotel.

Staff was very friendly.< /review><date>1509408000000< /date></record></dataset><record>

Everything was perfect but the cleaning lady keeps open the door without knocking the door.. Why?? She started opening the door with her master key from 8am!!!!!!??????? 
I was on the call and fricked out when she came!
So i told her i’ll be check out at noon (which is their checkout time)
And she opened the door (WITHOUT KNOCKING!) again after 1hour!!!!!!! i’m not sure she forgot or something.

So told her same thing again.

Guess what!? She opened the door 3 times more.
( i totally understand she wanted cleaning the room SO bad but it’s kind creepy tho)
Geez! Idk she intentionally did it or not but it’s so disrespectful. 

And i didn’t bring it up to the frontdesk people when I checked out since i was headed big meeting.

I never experienced this kind of happening tho..

Except that freaking creepy experience, i really enjoyed the place. 
Room service food was great as well. I even double tipped them.< /text>

< Review>
We had a wonderful three nights stay. The staff were very friendly and the cleaning staff were amazing. It was a beautiful hotel and close to all the sites and events we were in town for. All the beds were comfortable and the towels were all soft and fluffy. Everyday, our room was immaculately cleaned. We really appreciated how quiet and tidy the hotel was--giving us a very pleasant stay. The air conditioner didn't always cool the room down when we wanted, and our toilet got stuck a couple of times. However, the maintenance staff were quick and very pleasant.< /Review>

I booked a last minute stay because I signed up for a half marathon in Woodside. It was the perfect place to stay and I felt lucky that I found this hotel without doing much research. The front desk, curbside staff and restaurant staff were all helpful and friendly. It was close to my race and fun restaurants and bars were only a 10 minutes away. I would definitely stay here again.< /text>

Its location is great and you dont want to leave once you are there with the pool great parking great staff. A big big draw back is the lack of bar food while after a late night of work and just wanted some snack food the bar was our choice the choice of drinks were great but trying to get something to take the edge off but not wanting a meal was missed. no real snacks offered by the bartender, no snacks on the early closing restaurant. the space was great to have a few drinks with co-workers and i even had a friend come by. my friend and i ended up leaving looking for a spot that had some snacks to enjoy a larger selection of draft beers.< /Review>

Checked in to a room that had no working air conditioning. When switching rooms, asked for an upstairs room to be told what I am paying only got the 1st and 2nd floor - even though I have paid less and stayed on upper floors at the same hotel and people in my group staying at the same time paying the same were staying in floors above 2. I had to check out early for personal reasons and was told I would be charged a cancellation fee of $200. I asked to speak to a manager, none were available, left my phone number to have them call me and no has ever called. For the money, stay some where else that will give you better service.<//text>

<Name>mw99nd< /Name><date>1501459200000< /date><rate>None</rate><Text>My family booked and pre-paid for this hotel, when we got our room the description of the room (Club Room) did not match (there is no Club and the space was not what we requested for sleeping arrangements for our 2 year old) but the hotel fixed this. All seemed fine with the stay, but a few weeks later when our credit card bill arrived, I saw an unauthorized additional change (not parking, not meals that were authorized) on our bill for our pre-paid room. I called that day and they said they would remove it, a couple weeks later it was still on the account. I called their accounting department again to be told that the pre-paid hotel room cost more and are trying to figure out why the charge went to me. Hopefully this will be resolved, but it has ruined the experience we had with the hotel.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

My wife and I stayed in the Beatles Room, with the memorabilia from their 1965 stay at the hotel then called the Cabana Hotel that even had a vinyl record player and some old Beatle LP's.  We stayed 3 nights visiting my son at Stanford.  We had a very comfortable stay and the hotel had very friendly and professional staff.  

When packing to leave I notice how my lap top blended in with the color of the desk top it was sitting on and thought to myself, good thing I noticed that now.  Well as you might guess I did in fact leave it and it wasn't until I got home and two days later couldn't find it that it dawned on me what must have happened.  A quick call to the front desk and they confirmed they had it and my son picked it up and sent it and dropped a little gift to the head of housekeeping to ,thank the honest person who found it.  That's the kind of hotel it is.< /Review>

<review>Last updated in the 80s with the exception of the new and comfortable mattresses, I would not recommend anyone stay here. At $500 a night, I expected less motel and more hotel; less standard Quaker Oats and more steel cut oats; fewer kids running around the lobby and more business persons doing business. Alas, I was stuck with disappointment.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /Gmap_id><rating>None<//rating></record>

The room and bed were very comfortable. We were impressed with free snacks, waters, slippers. The bathroom was ample and I enjoyed the bathtub. The robes were very luxurious.

The view out of our 7th floor room was amazing. We enjoyed the lounge and complimentary drinks. We were not able to enjoy the pool and spa but plan to do so on our next stay.

A great value!< /Review>

Everything about our stay was absolutely perfect! The room was beautiful, comfortable and spotless. Every member of the staff that we came in contact with was friendly and helpful, and the Front Desk Supervisor (Zeenal) went out of her way to make sure that we had an unforgettable visit. The complimentary breakfast buffet was delicious! We enjoy the Crowne Plaza Cabana more than any other hotel that we stay at and we will be back every time we have an excuse to visit the Bay Area!< /Review>

Fantastic experience, hands-down.
Due to other reviews on this property, I was 50/50 before checking-in. And after two-nights, I am 100% a fan!

At this quiet college town, this is a BIG hotel property.
Full service bar, and HUGE dinning area.
The room is clean, and the bathroom is spacious.

Parking is convenient, and so is the business center.

If you are in town for NCAA basketball games or business, come and check this place out~! you won't disappoint.</text>

My son was having brain surgery at Stanford, and it was taking longer than expected, so his surgeon suggested that we go rest. Who checked into the Crowne Plaza about 10 at night. The only rooms available were those with outside access, so they were offered at a cheaper rate. It was nothing fancy, but the rooms were clean, and furnished well. The decor was a little outdated, but reasonable for the price of the room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. But there is no Bell or room service. I would recommend staying for a short business trip or an emergency, but this wouldn't be the place for a vacation.</Text>

What a great hotel! Super friendly staff and very large rooms. Some of us wondered if we had been upgraded to a suite because of the size of the room, but we were told those are the standard room. Very clean, very detailed housekeeping staff. I loved pool area, I just wish it didn't close so early.
I also wish I could remember the name of the bartender gentleman who worked the first couple days of my stay. He was very nice, and had lots of info about the area to share, he's a keeper.
Thank you for a great stay, I look forward to visiting the area again.< /text>

Came with my family to visit our son who recently moved to Palo Alto. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Hotel is conveniently located with easy access to freeways and local restaurants. The only thing I didn't like was that the hotel website/reservation page doesn't explain there is a charge for overnight parking until after one makes the reservation.< /Review>

Nice rooms with awesome staff. Considered docking a star because the resteraunt in the hotel had pretty bad service, but there are a thousand other places to eat. Would stay again.</Text>

Whenever we purchase a product or service, we all expect to get what we paid for.

When things go wrong, we expect those responsible for the product or service to correct the root issue.

We communicated "as soon as" the hotel's mishaps happened.  NO ONE listened to us, heard us or moved quickly to RESOLVE the issues.

It took speaking to five (5) different staff members, leaving three (3) different voicemail messages, and writing a very detailed email to the general manager.

If you keep giving your money to people and/or companies that prioritize a dollar bill over healthy and functional business relationship, you'll get the same low-bar product or service.

Raise Your Bar.

This was our VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE at the Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto.

We are not responsible for maintaining the property.  We are not responsible for the job of those in charge at the hotel.</Text>

<Review>The one thing I would highly suggest for IHG properties is to have bottled water in the rooms, especially for Platinum Members at no charge. I travel quite a bit and stay at other hotels and they always offer water for members at no charge.

When I stay at this hotel it always surprises me that they never offer water and I have to remember to stop and get some on my own.

If the manager can take the time to print out a thank you letter, then can they please remember to put water in the room?

Thanks!< /Review>< pictures>

The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. The overall hotel was very nice. I enjoyed the free diffused water in the lobby. Hotel bar was nice and empty. Good moscow mules. The room was pretty humid and warm. The AC wasn't working properly. It was warmer in our room than it was outside (in July). 

Also, I added breakfast on to my reservation but wasn't told by the customer service person on the phone that it ended at 9:30am (that's pretty early to end breakfast). If i'd known, I wouldn't have added it.<//text>

<Review>We were planning to stay one day as my grandmother was staying at Stanford Hospital. We had to travel up a day earlier and needed to add a day and attempt to do an early check in so my mother can get rest from the all nighter. The hotel was understanding and extremely accommodating. Because of them, we were able to enjoy our stay as much as we could given the circumstances.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>We were coming into town for a Football event for the Blue and Grey super combine. By the time we booked our room we could only get a King bed. I mentioned to the gentlemen on the phone while making the reservation that my son and I would just have to share. When we got to our room they had added a twin for my son. That was so amazing! For them to take the time and effort.

The front desk was helpful with the information for the event. They also provided directions around the area. My son was looking for a Chick Fe-lay.
The staff in the front of the hotel was very helpful with parking instructions as well. We are from the Vegas area and are used to completely different parking arrangements

The evening of the banquet the staff was also right on point. The tables were lovely the room clean and updated. When you have several hundred people eating from a serving line and over 100 of them football players, who unless you normally feed one have no idea how they eat , running out of food happens.They only Item that ran out was rolls, Which the staff promptly refilled. The food was also very tasty.
As the evening went on a couple of us had wanted some coffee. A staff member quickly brought us some with all the condiments. I would recommend this facility for any event.<//review><time>1437004800000< /time>< username>

<Text>I stayed at this property for 5 nights and 6 days paying a high prices for the room.
How ever the room was given to me after waiting for an hour and also well past 3 pm .
The reception was very cold and unwelcoming and the allotted to me was on ground floor with no view.
Even after repeated request on every day morning for change of room, it was denied.
Very unhappy experience. One of the worst I ever had at any other hotel.<//Text>< Pictures>

the person who checked me in obv wasnt properly trained. he never acknowledged my platinum status, so no upgrade and no arrival gift. when i asked for a bottle of water he initially didnt want to give; only after i reminded him of my platinum status did he give the bottle of water. the room he first assigned me (on floor 2) overlooks roof top aircons that make humming noises that bothered me; when i asked for a room change he assigned me to a room in an annexed part to the main building which cant be an upgrade if not a downgrade. other than that my one night stay was good and other staff were all courteous and helpful.<//Text>

see my previous comments. Outrageous parking charges when parking is free everywhere in Palo Alto. I parked in the back of the hotel and was still charged $60 for that spot.Also very poor service in the restaurant. I had to flag down a waiter to bring me a menu after 10 munutes of waiting. He dropped the menu on my table and did not say a word. He never returned to take my order. I had to ask another waiter to take my order. That took another 20 minutes. I told her what happened and all she said was "Oh". Should have asked for the manager but I was just happy to finish and pay my bill.</review>

Upgraded to a big suite with my status - room was lovely and clean although balcony/terrace was right next to what looked like a balcony for an event space (which wasn't in use for my stay)

I was woken up however by the sound of people on the treadmills in the gym which was on the same floor - not ideal when I've been travelling and need rest, but not the end of the world when I had to get up for an event about 30 minutes later. Not sure if any other rooms could hear it but it wasn't very nice!

Wish I'd been able to use the pool - pool area looked lovely.

Did get a free glass of wine in the lobby after a long day!</Review>

You were originally going to see a concert at the Shoreline and got a hotel to hang out at before and after. I love the hotel so much and wanted to hang out by the pool and decided to not even go to the concert, plus it was so hot that weekend.  Is my second time here and I will definitely be coming back</Text>

This was my second visit to this Crowne Plaza location, and I was not disappointed! The staff was as friendly as on my first visit and quite helpful. I was particularly pleased with the shuttle to downtown Palo Alto which made going out to grab dinner from some of my local favorites a breeze!</Review>

The hotel was clean, friendly staff and helpful with accommodations. 

The food ordered from room service was tasty and the service was quick. 

The location was great for getting to my office as well as restaurants and shopping. 

There was also a shuttle to get to Cal train which was convenient. 

Overall an excellent place to stay.<//review>

Awesome hotel! I had a great stay. The staff was very accommodating to my needs, and were always polite. I would recommend clarifying the complimentary shuttle service. When I made my reservation, I was told that the shuttle went every half hour to Stanford (my destination). However, when I needed to be at Stanford, the shuttle was not available (the concierge said it started later than I was told). It cost me a lot of money for a taxi. Fortunately, the rest of the time, I was able to get rides from other event participants. I only wish the shuttle schedule had been made clearer. The pool and hot tub are great, and even though my room faced the outside and was near the lobby and parking lot, it was totally quiet!< /Review>

We brought a group of 50-75 folks back to the hotel after an event. There was a prom in one of the ballrooms and so there was a lot going on. We didn't have reservations so the staff didn't know we were coming but they responded exceedingly well. They were courteous, set up extra tables and served us in a timely way. I really appreciated how they handled it. I believe they might have gone home early had we not arrived but they responded like pros. I was very impressed.< /Text>

We had a few issues that the staff were great with.  1. Some other guests had decided that our balcony was where they wanted to converse so they hopped the fence and were sitting there when we checked in.  Hotel security promptly asked them to relocate.  2. I left my laptop at the front desk during checkout and they held it for me.  Daved my butt on that one.< /Text>

As a frequent traveler who stays in a variety of mid to upper level hotels, this specific Crowne Plaza is like no other hotel.  I was welcomed to their home as a guest.  They waited on me, conversed with me, cared for me as one of their own.  It was a highly unusual stay.  I left the property wondering when I could return specifically to this hotel.  The food was unique and delicious.  The bed provided a full night's rest.  The room was appropriately cooled.  The room service was attentive and cheery.  And, it was because of the guest care I received, I will most definitely return.< /Text>

For what it is the hotel was rather expensive but that was more the location than anything else.  It is an older hotel but well looked after so no issues with its age and certainly has more character than most these days.  Stayed in the Beatles room which was pretty cool and the staff were friendly and helpful.< /Review>

Very nice staff to greet you, great location, and easy to park! The drain in my room would hardly work and after reporting it someone was there within a half hour! I haven't had a chance to eat here but the breakfast buffet looks amazing. If I was in Palo Alto again I would definitely stay here.<//Review>

<text>Nice property right on El Camino Real in Palo Alto, which made it very convenient for my needs. The room was spacious, clean and modern. The check-in and check-out experience left a lot to be desired, though.

Upon check-in, my IHG Platinum status normally ensures that my key is ready, and I just need to pick that up and head to the room. At this property, though, I had to fill out paperwork in the same way that anyone that didn't have a reservation would need to, even though all of that same information is also in my IHG profile (which they acknowledged they had access to). What should have been a 2-3 minute check-in process turned into a 20 minute debacle where a staff member clearly under training tried to get this done.

Check-out brought more of the same. No bill under my door as normal, so I had to go to the front desk to get a copy of the bill. Again, what is normally a 1-2 minute print out took over 20 minutes to get done.

Maybe when the staff is fully trained, this hotel will be worth staying at. Until this, I'd stay away for a bit until that is resolved<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Nice place. Went for brunch on mother's day. Great brunch, a little pricey for 5 adults and 2 kids. Over 400! Service was meh. Had to waive down the servers to get a refill on the mimosas (which were unlimited) and had to ask a couple times to get some water poured. Nice though. Been a couple times already for mother's day.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I got married here! About a year ago, I signed my contract to get married. Since then, Marisa has been the most helpful person on the planet. She would always reply quickly to my emails and was knowledgeable when it came to putting together the perfect wedding. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is getting married here!

The day before, I had a bunch of people come and check-in to the hotel. The front desk staff was super patient and friendly. They helped everyone get into a room as soon as possible. The bellmen were also super helpful in moving all of our luggage and flowers into the necessary rooms. The staff was so friendly, they even remembered me a week later when I came back to pick up the rest of my things!</review>< pictures>

Room decor is from 1980; Felt like I was staying in a roadside motel.  Lobby is nice - but I am not sleeping in the lobby.</Text>

<text>A busy weekend for hotels. I was disappointed the pool was not heated but the room and general atmosphere and service was good. The front desk attendant was very polite and helpful and Gabriel who was our waiter at breakfast was extremely attentive and friendly.

<review>I booked and paid for an executive king suite but was informed on check-in (11pm) that there had been a "cancellation issue" with my room and I was offered either a standard king or a Cabana 2-queen room as an alternative. The explanation given as to how this could have happened was very vague and noncommittal -- but let's be real: I booked a particular room and they either rented it to someone else (their mistake) or perhaps it experienced a secret maintenance issue that could not be resolved (their problem).

I had to press to receive compensation for the downgrade. I was offered an extra drink coupon and free breakfasts, which were a nice gesture but of no use to me given my schedule. They ultimately knocked a bit off my nightly rate, which made me feel somewhat better, but really what I wanted (traveling for business) was the nicer room. The staff was pleasant enough about the issue, but clearly wanted to "get it over with" in the most expedient fashion possible. The manager kept reminding me that he was willing to put me in these rooms "due to [my] gold status" as if providing me with a downgrade was somehow doing me a favor.

I went with the Cabana room at the recommendation of the night manager. The Cabana rooms are adequate by mid-tier hotel chain standards but in definite need of a refresh compared to the "main hotel" rooms (older tile floor as opposed to marble in the main hotel, older windows that make a whistling sound due to air pressure, etc.).

I want to like the Crown Plaza Cabana as it's convenient to a business destination for me and I stay there fairly often (5-6 times per year). Out of those, I'd say I've had some sort of issue with my visit around 50% of the time (false fire alarms going off during the night, room availability issues, item disappearing from lost-and-found). I'm honestly a very go-with-the-flow business traveler and not a "complainy" kind of review writer. But I'm going to think twice about staying at this particular hotel again, it's just gotten to be too much.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

There was no available outlet at the bedside. I had to unplug the clock after moving out the night table. Heat was very high upon entering the room, so I turned it down. After that, it never kicked on again, so the room was a bit colder than comfortable.

The gym had 3 treadmills, and one would not start up on "quick start."

Staff was very friendly and room service was excellent. Conference rooms and catering was also very good. Strong wifi as well. Free bottled water throughout stay and lots of areas for side-chats in lobby and lounge. Rooms and bathrooms were clean. No sign of bedbugs in my room (most important!).<//Review>< user>

A nice cozy place to stay in Palo Alto.  Friendly staff and very clean hotel.  Nice touch with the Temple Spa toiletries which we really liked.

Stay here often and never disappointed. Almost always get a room upgrade. Staff excellent. Internet free for IHG member. Room quiet and always clean. Always able to get me early check in. Dinged my review on sleep quality because of the pillows but that's a personal preference. I don't like squishy feather pillows, more of a fan of supportive foam. But bed mattress, darkness, quietness all very conducive to sleep otherwise.
Only argument... parking is $12 to self park about 20 feet away, even for IHG members. There is no lack of parking or space so always rubs me wrong to get charged for that.</Review>

The Crowne Plaza Hotel in Palo Alto, is a clean hotel, from the lobby, to the pool area, to the guest rooms. I was impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel.

The bed was comfortable, which made it difficult when it was time to check out.

The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.

This hotel is close to many restaurants, many within walking distance.

I would, without a doubt, stay at this hotel again.</text>

We stayed at this hotel for the duration of Stanford's graduation ceremony (2 nights). Requested to pay for parking, room was lacking regular coffee and cups - upon arrival and after our first night, there was no microwave, there was no fan in the bathroom, complimentary breakfast only if we checked out before 8am, bed/pillows were not very comfortable, A/C (fan) ran continually. Total bill = 2 nights stay, 2 cocktails, 1 dessert and dinner = $1000!</Text>

I have always hosted corporate meetings in this properties and just few days ago I was able to do a staycation. I was so impressed with the bedrooms. We were so close to the pool - it was not crowded (the pool was practically just for us), the staff were so great. Its so great for family. The kids just loves it.< /review>

This is a great hotel will stay again just hope next time the management can setup a payment discount for Veterans and there families that need to stay in outside hotels as the VA has very limited rooms so overflow go's into City of Palo Alto and we come a long way sometimes to get the special service that only the Veterans Hospital in Palo Alto can provide. Maybe the Government discount can include Veterans and family that need to stay in Palo Alto. Other than that it is a great place and have stayed before and will return again. The staff worked with me and were really outstanding one person at front counter Robert not sure of his last name but really went out of his way to help. Thank you and see you again soon.

Location is only 5 mins from the Veterans Hospital in Palo Alto.</Text>

<text>The hotel staff are very friendly. I travel to California several times a year and I wouldn't stay anywhere else. I still remember one of the first times I stayed there and had a terrible fall at the airport and they couldn't help enough. They all volunteered a wheelchair and ice. I don't know how many places you can go where the staff goes above and beyond.

I also use Crowne Plaza for personal travel as well as business. I feel always at home when I go to the Palo Alto Crowne Plaza. I guess because I have stayed there a lot in the past three years.

If you have the opportunity to take the shuttle, the driver is soooo knowledgeable about Palo Alto and he knows the spots to eat.</text>< Pics>

<Review>not the best location, you'll have to drive a bit to get to some decent restaurants and shops. it does have many onsite amenities. quite overpriced for what it is, especially not worth it if it is a personal trip. you can end up getting a room with a window that faces the walkway, meaning no privacy and motel-style feeling, even as a Platinum Elite member.</Review><Date>1540166400000</Date>< Response>

Upon checking in, as customary hotel required personal credit card for any incidentals. There should’ve been $100 held from my account for incidental transactions. However the entire room expense was suddenly deducted from my personal account opposed to the company credit card that was already on file, a difference of $300. This caused my bank account to overdraw. I immediately got a notice from my bank via text. I brought the error to the attention of the front desk staff. They were apologetic and attempted to correct it immediately however the damage was already done. I assumed, it would take possibly after a few hours for it to reflect the correction on my account. However the next day there still was no change. I was teaching a class in one of the hotels conference rooms all day , which was now Saturday . When I finished my class at 5 PM nearly 24 hours after the mistake I still have no funds in my account. I went back to the front desk to see if they could see any changes on their end. I was informed the funds would not be released until Monday and then asked if that was OK. Apparently there was no way to reverse the charges on my account due to how the banks in companies exchange information. I stated to the gentleman I had no money and nothing to eat and if this was the case it would be two days before I would get to eat. He smiled and said “OK have a nice night.” 

This was an honest mistake, at no fault of myself, yet there I was, stranded with the thought of not eating for two days. So I decided to call guest services at IHG headquarters. The first representative I spoke to stated: “well I’m sorry this happened. It sounds like this was mostly our fault.” Stunned, I repeated “MOSTLY your falt?” He replied, “your company should have been specific about which card the room would be paid with.” I corrected this misstatement, reminding him they already had the company card on file and the hotel stated they just needed my card for incidentals. He then stated that he would be unable to help me.

I asked if there was anyone I could speak with that could help. He transferred me to a supervisor. The female supervisor seamed frustrated, not understanding why I called and what I wanted them to do. I stated, this error was no fault of my own, and I was curious why the hotel had not even offered me a meal knowing their error has left me with no means of purchaseing anything. The supervisor placed me on hold for approximately 5 minutes. Upon returning to my call , she stated she had just spoke to the front desk of my hotel and they would speak to the manager and contact me. That was 6pm Saturday night.

Sunday afternoon at 4 pm , I completed the class I was teaching all weekend at the hotel . Yet still had never heard from anyone to make sure I was ok, or offer even a piece of toast.<//Text>< userid>

I was headed to Palo Alto for a conference at Stanford and after reading quite a few negative reviews of the "upscale" brand properties in the area, I decided to go with the Crowne Plaza and was pleasantly surprised. The staff is absolutely 5-star (much better than some of the world's priciest, premier properties). and the room was clean and functional. The restaurant was also good, with above average food quality and an excellent wait staff. Overall, I definitely felt like the staff went out of their way to make me feel at home. I would absolutely stay here again!< /text>

<text>that I booked them into your hotel to celebrate Mother's Day.
I booked two poolside rooms, one for the adults and one for the children.
One room was switched on me because both rooms were to have
an adjoining door between them but did not.

However, the children LOVED the pool and my son spent most of his time playing in the pool with them. A very healthy activity to share with your children.

When my son got back to San Luis Obispo, he notified me that he
left his iPad in his room. I notified the Cabana and Carman, the room cleaner, had brought the iPad to the Lost and Found of the hotel.
We were all so very appreciative of Carman's honesty.

THANK YOU, Sheila< /text>< pics>

Recently had our wedding here and also spent the entire wedding weekend here with family and friends. The staff was very helpful and treated us and all of our guest very well. They accommodated us in every way they can. The rooms are sweet. We personally booked two suites ourselves and both suites plus the presidential suite they gave us was amazing. Clean, comfy, and large enough for our wedding party to prep in.

The hotel is also a great venue for our big event. Large beautiful ballroom and the entire hotel features spaces that our guest enjoyed.

Definitely a hidden gem that I would recommend.</Text>

<Text>The staff was wonderful. They were always helpful. However, initially I was told I was being upgraded and the room was not what I had hoped for. However, they changed the room without any problem. But the room still did not meet the requests I have posted for my IHG membership, i.e. I always request an upper floor, but was placed on the second floor of a six or seven story hotel.
The hotel is beautiful.A car and driver are provided for going into town, which is nice because parking can be a problem in downtown Palo Alto.
The bar area is pleasant and relaxing.
The relaxation packet provided in the room is wonderful.
The rooms are loud. If you are facing the lobby you can hear dogs barking (in the lobby) and people chatting.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I cannot say enough about our stay. From the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the bellman everything just flowed. At every instance we were treated with silk gloves. When we found that our room had some excessive A/C roof top noise the front desk clerk did not blink an eye. He simply went on to see how he could accommodate us in a better location. At breakfast the manager went out of his way to assist us. We had been told that the cafeteria opened at 6:30 am when in fact it was 7:00 am. The manager brought us coffee, fruit, toast and cereal even though breakfast was not fully set up. Again, amazing staff, amazing place.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I have been staying at this property since December 2016 and from day one the staff has gone above and beyond for any request that I or my coworkers who have been staying since July of 2016. If there was anything that they either didn't know or had to clarify they made sure to get back to us. It's always been a pleasure dealing with the staff wether it was the front desk (Rose, Maritza) to the bar (Javier) all the way down to the shuttle driver (Steve). All of my stays have been without any complaints the rooms are cleaned daily the room service is quick along with the standard of food served in the restaurant/bar has been stellar. The only suggestion I have moving forward is that maybe the happy hour food menu or the full restaurant food menu could use a few new items. I have and will continue to encourage my coworkers to book at this location due to how well all the amenities and my experience has been thus far.</text>

Being stricken with Cancer the MGR Rose went above and beyond to make my stay comfortably fit for a King. I was in getting a second opinion and also checking in on a project i started before my long journey with treatments. The entire staff at this hotel has touched my heart in many ways so when I beat this i will make it a point to come back and give each and everyone a hug from me.<//Review>

Booked directly through hotel to rest assured I would receive the room I was requested. Folliwed up with a phone call. Arrived 45 minutes after check in time to no room on bottom floir available. Rosa was wonderful and apologized. She assured me that there would be checkouts following day. Would be no problem to move us into first one vacated if i spoke with concierge. They were horrible, all day run around. Service</Text>

This hotel is great - much nicer than I expected given that I've stayed in Crowne Plaza's in the past. The front desk upgraded me to the Beatles room, which was fantastic. Very clean, modern amenities. The hotel service staff from valet to room service was very nice and accommodating. Definitely recommend!</review>

I was surprised at the decor and cleanliness of the property for the price. It was a great value in that sense. However, the front desk service was terrible. I needed to check in early at 2 PM (preferably earlier) because I had to attend an event at 3. I called a week before my stay to ask for early check in. They told me to call the night before my stay. I called the night before my stay and was told that there was a good chance I could get early check in because the hotel was only at 70% capacity, however, they told me I needed to call the next morning to be sure. I called the following morning and I explained my situation and they told me that there were no rooms available and to call back at 11 AM. I called back at 11 AM and they took my number and told me that they would give me a call when my room was ready. I arrived at 2 PM because I needed to drop my car off before the event (although it would've been nice to settle in and get ready in my room beforehand), and my room was indeed ready. However, I DID NOT GET A CALL FROM ANYONE. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /Text>

Public areas of the hotel were very beautiful and the staff was incredibly nice. My room was clean... but awkward. IE: The shower head was positioned so low on the wall that I had to get on my knees to wash my hair. It's like they redesigned the rooms at some point but put very little thought into it.</review>

<rating>None<//rating><Text>I thought the property looked really great. It appeared more expensive that the rates actually were. The staff was exceptional.

Found room service food for lunch was lukewarm...it was a grilled cheese. The staff person offered to return it but I accepted it. The breakfast I ordered was great.

I attended a group event. I found the food at the dinner was "airline food" with very dry chicken, bland salmon and unimaginative sides. The desserts were delicious.

Overall, an individual should find their stay very pleasant. A group might be disappointed in the food provided.

But no one will be disappointed in the comfort of the rooms and the customer service provided by the staff.<//Text>< pictures>

The hotel was very nice! Clean and managed by the Holliday chain, so you can points! The room was quaint. All the normal stuff that comes in a hotel room! They have a great Sunday brunch. Large swimming pool. The reason for my 4 * review, is that they make you pay for parking as an overnight guest?!?!?</review>

<text>This hotel maybe good in the summer.  It was not great during my stay in January for the following reasons:
1. the door to my room was so drafty (the room is located in the side wing which is not enclosed) that I had to turn the heat way up;
2. the HVAC was noisy which ran all night for keep the room warm.

I should have requested a different room but I didn't have the time or energy when we leave the hotel before 7am for work and get back after 9pm for the 4 days.<//text><time>1487808000000< /time>< Rating>

Even though we were visiting friends in San Francisco it was worth the 40-minute drive to our hotel in the evening.

The Crowne Plaza has done a good job of taking an old, dilapidated property and giving it a fresh new look. I stayed there for a class reunion and the front desk handled the influx of new people easily. The bar was great for a meet-up and the prices for drinks and hors d'oeuvres were reasonable. The location certainly is convenient.< /Text>

Great place to stay for a couple of days if you are visiting Palo Alto. Hotel is close to everything yet the rate is lower than other places.

The room was extremely clean and the staff was extremely attentive. I recommend the Cabana room if you like to relax on the patio near the pool.</Review>

The reservation was easy to make, and with the AAA discount (or was it the senior one?) it was a very reasonable price. When I arrived, I was told that my room had been upgraded, and my request for a quiet room on a high floor (made when reserving) had been taken care of. (Top floor, furthest room from elevators and ice machines.)

I haven't stayed here in decades, but it was perfectly comfortable and included everything I needed.

Oh, one thing... There was a poster in the elevator saying "the Beatles stayed here in '63." That was a year before their first US tour, and two years before they stayed at the Cabana. Close but no cigar! (I was in high school then, and we were all excited to have them in town!)< /Review>

I stayed with my 3 children when they came to visit my youngest and I at Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital. It is very close to the hospital, the room was beautiful, very quiet. They upgraded us to a patio pool view, the kids and I got in the spa that night. Beds were comfortable and everyone at the hotel couldn't have been nicer. Also parking was right outside the room when you stay in the exterior part of the hotel.<//Text>

Open access areas recently refurbished,  good working areas.  Also reasonable small meeting room with soft furnishings,  but needs to be booked ($85/hr).  Beverage/food tablets available across the open access areas for ordering to bring direct to your seat.  Room was comfortable as always.</text>

We stayed here for two non-consecutive nights recently. Part of the hotel seems to be old and part is new.  The night that I paid for with points was in the old part of the hotel in the back of the property and the room needs updating. The night that I paid rack rate, we were in the front of the hotel and the room was very nice.  We had a good room service breakfast.<//Review>

Rafael, the restaurant manager, ensured my family had a pleasant stay and was very accommodating with breakfast for my child's early soccer games.  Our family really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and the courtesy of the staff.< /text>

<Text>I stayed start of December and after a long flight from the UK , I had a warm welcome by valet even though I was not driving. Ended up arriving at the hotel around 4:30PM but when I walked in to reception it was freezing cold.....not stayed here before so not sure whether that is the normal but not the best frist impression. However the reception staff were great, big smiles and very helpful. I was a little shocked that the hotel being so quiet at that time I had to wait for my room? Little late in the afternoon to be waiting for a room but reception did offer me a drink at the bar which I duly accepted. The wait for the room was not that long but one thing I did notice while sitting in the bar is the resturant looking very soleless and like a canteen. I know it was 4:30 in the afternoon but even later when I returned to the bar at dinner time for a beer it still looked very unappealing, the food might be great though but I did not get to sample it as I was eating out during my stay.

My room was great very clean and a lovely view towards the hills at the back. It was quiet and I had some great nights sleep there. One thing that did bug me was the noise from the aircon even though it was turned off....thank god for earplugs! Room was clean (not sure about the furniture though) and the house keeping staff again were polite and always said good morning with a smile. The bar was ok but cold (temprature) and a little expenive. Javier who worked a couple of nights I was there was a great guy and happy to serve and have a chat....always helps when travelling on your own. One person that did keep appearing in differents areas was Tony. I first met him when he brought my bags to my room, then he appeared in reception, then behind the bar.....lovely chap and very helpful! Lastly thanks to the young man drinving the "little pick me up" for taking me up to Stamford Mall and back again....shame it was an expensive visit.

Good hotel, great staff and will be back again.</Text><name>EnglishPhil<//name><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

<Text>We had a lovely stay at this hotel. We had to drive to Palo Alto from San Francisco under stressful circumstances, as we could not find a hotel anywhere in the city or the peninsula. Once we got there though, it was lovely. Pool was fantastic for the kids. Rooms were roomy and well appointed. That night, there were some disturbances from other guests. The next morning, when my husband checked out (he had not commented on the noise- which was brief), the desk said they were very sorry about the situation and comped one of our rooms. We found this to be very proactive approach for customer service. Absolutely appreciated it, and will go out of our way to find a Crowne Plaza in our future travels. Coincidentally, we also stayed in a Holiday Inn Express in Santa Cruz, and found the service there to be excellent as well. Thank you!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Had to find a motel at the last minute for a high school reunion. This hotel was one of those recommended. With two reunions going on at the last minute I was lucky to get the last king room available for my sister and I.

It was withing my budget and exceeded all my expectations.

Thank you for making my stay so comfortable when I had to find a place at the last minute.

<text>Love this hotel, and the service but the public areas pre-function space and ballroom and corridors on guest rooms floors were way too cold . Probably around 63-64 degrees and wasted energy. Hard to adjust temperature satisfactorily on the room and it was noisy when it switched itself on and off.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Reservation email confirmation indicated the wrong date and wrong number of persons in the party.
Upon my call back the accommodations were corrected and a new confirmation emailed.
Upon arrival I found that two rooms were reserved for me contrary to the revised confirmation.
I was informed that breakfast the following morning was included but upon arrival at the in house restaurant that " according to my room number" there was a $17.00 per person charge for breakfast.

During our stay the tv remote was working intermittently and needs new batteries. This deficiency was reported to two staff members by never acted upon.</review>< username>

Five stars for the service alone! Stayed here for several weeks for work and found the rooms very pleasant, well appointed and comfortable. More than that, I had ample time to get acquainted with the staff and every staff member I encountered was incredibly kind, helpful and went above and beyond. They also had nice events to make the stay a bit more enjoyable, like a weekly Off the Grid food truck event in the parking lot, free wine and cheese happy hours with drink coupons for the bar, and so on.< /Text>

We found the Crowne Plaza, Palo Alto to be an excellent base for our 2-week stay.
The shuttle service provided for the vicinity of Palo Alto and the Stanford campus was really helpful, and the two drivers were always punctual and helpful.
The con ditions in our room were comfortable, the bed excellent and the view inspiring.< /Text>

This is not the first time that I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza and so I knew what to expect, and it did live up to expectations. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly. I really like the free shuttle service. Breakfast is okay, but could do with some more variety. I enjoy the dinner menu but I don't think this has changed since my last 6 months ago.< /Review>

Check-in staff ignored to my room preference request at check in. Subsequently, had to involve manager. Moved to room that met my security preferences, but new room did not have TV! Had to move rooms again. Room missing in-room service menu. Took four calls to reach room service staff and order dinner.

Most rooms have doors to the outside of hotel.< /Text>

My only issue was the fact that the water was extremely slow to heat up, we had to run the water for say 3 to 5 minutes before we could even be able to shower. Not a huge deal, I just didn't to run the water unnecessarily . Other than that, I thought it was a great experience< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This hotel's location was centrally located for my business trip. It was good to see that the hotel had a restaurant onsite; however, since I had a vehicle, I was inclined to explore other eating venues. The room was quite spacious and had a refrigerator; however, no microwave,  but that was ok for my short stay.   I did find it awkward not to have a safe in the room,  so I opted for no cleaning service during my short stay as well and had to carry everything with me,  which made my handbag a bit heavier than expected.   

Overall,  good stay,  but cost of room was quite expensive considering there was no executive floor or complimentary breakfast or evening reception.</Text>

I have stayed at this property once or twice a month for the last 2 years and have always had an excellent stay. They are always accommodating to my requests (inside tower room, early check in, quiet floor), recognize me by name, provide free drink and breakfast coupons, upgrade my room type (as high as the several room suites free of charge), provide a free shuttle within a certain distance of the hotel, and the list goes on. During my last visit, I had arrived after a 13hr travel day - I was upgraded to an enormous suite, given a free drink and breakfast coupon and was left a plate of fresh fruit by the front office supervisor (Thanks Mr Khan!). The wireless internet is always free with excellent signal and the office/computer room is well stocked. The walls are well insulated so it is always quiet in my room - I never hear anything from adjoining rooms.
I have had to stay at the Sheraton Palo Alto when this property has been full and while the Sheraton has been extremely kind and welcoming (upgrading my rooms as well) and is closer to Stanford, the price is almost always higher and the Wifi is $10/day, which is really annoying and actually my biggest hangup about staying there.
The Crowne Plaza staff is fabulous and I look forward to my next stay; thanks to all at the Cabana!</Review>

Hi 

I enjoy from my stay in the hotel for the weekend. 
very nice & quiet hotel.
I got a large room outside near to the pool as I requested.
The room was clean but there a need to improve a little (example should be clean also under the bed ... )

Thanks the staff that was a kind and helpfull</review>

<Review>We chose this hotel specifically for the hot tub. When we checked in, we told the front desk clerk this. He never said anything about the hot tub being closed for renovation. We went out and bought swimsuits for the 4 of us, got back to the room, and changed. We went down to the pool area and it was closed. When we went to the desk to talk about it, the new clerk was apologetic and said it was not the first time he had done that. That is unacceptable, even more so when you realize that he has done it multiple times with no consequences. That hot tub had been closed for weeks, and there was no way that the front desk could not have known.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1514040650098< /date><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>When orchestrating a large scale, multi-day conference the hotel staff and food service can either make or break your success.  I have to say that the staff was fabulous and the food was delicious, fresh, hot and served right on time.  And because of this, this conference was a HUGE success.

I'll start with the not so great but please read the whole review. The not so great: the "poolside rooms" are a bit poorly maintained and outdated motel style rooms behind the main hotel. I booked this through my employers travel agency for a premium price per night so I expected a nice room but was not happy with the poolside room I was given. Now for the good: I did a quick Google and realized that I could in fact get the king suite in the tower for $5 more per night. I called the front desk and discussed my disappointment in my first room and they listened and apologized. Sadly the hotel was fully booked that night. Now for the amazing: I was staying there for 4 nights and on day 2 they transferred me into the king suite without giving me any guff or making me feel guilty in any way. They even sent a guy to move my bags over for me. They were so very nice and the new room is hands down my favorite hotel room I have ever had. It has a huge bedroom, a living room, and a deck with mountain views. Just outstanding. I am a service stickler and I would absolutely stay here again and again. Good work crowne!< /text>

Crowne Plaza Hotel Palo Alto hit the mark for me as a well-run Hotel with very friendly staff and a safe, clean, slightly Bohemian feel that sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill corporate hotels where everything looks the same. The courtyard and pool in the rear are delightful, as are the large rooms with very good air temperature/quality and low ambient noise. I feel comfortable recommending the Palo Alto Crowne Plaza Hotel to my friends.< /Review>

We enjoyed our stay at the Palo Alto hotel. Very courteous staff. The breakfast waitress was a little slow for our order and giving our bill but overall we had an enjoyable stay. I would recommend this hotel. We were travelling with our two children and the pool and spa was enjoyed by all.</review>

<Review>Stayed at hotel for a week. Bed was very comfortable which is always the main focus of any hotel stay. Rest of the room was more than adequate - even if the wardrobe was in the bathroom. Plenty of built in USB chargers too which was nice when going abroad and means no worries over plug sockets. My refrigerator wasn't on at arrival but a quick visit to reception had that solved within an hour. The restaurant is good but basic. Nothing but standard fare on offer.</Review>< Gmap_id>

The rooms and facilities were very comfortable and clean. But the staff seemed very confused about the terms of my reservation and those of my companions. Our reservations were supposed to include complimentary breakfast, but sometimes that was honored and other times not. If we asked two different staff or managers, we got two different answers depending on whether they were the evening staff or the morning staff. A consistent story would heve been appreciated.< /review>

<text>The Crowne Plaza was great. We arrived and were upgraded to a suite. Very courteous welcome, fast checkin and the room was beautiful. Love the decor and the couch was really comfortable, most hotel couches aren't that wonderful. How could you not love a red corduroy couch? The room was so dark, we really got to sleep in and since the kids didn't come with us we didn't have to listen to cartoons at the crack of dawn. We will definitely recommend to our friends. Thank you for a great night away!!</text>< pictures>

This hotel was not my first choice, but I am glad I stayed. I arrived late, and the staff was pleasant and accommodating. There was happy hour in the lobby, which was a welcome site.
I would recommend a free breakfast or continental to compete in the Palo Alto Area. Too  many other hotels offer free breakfast with a lower room rate.<//review>

First they sent me to a room that was already occupied. Oops.

Then they upgraded me to a suite, which sounds great, but really wasn't. The HVAC in the suite was only blowing hot air, so it was about 80 in the room.

Yes, I called to get it fixed, and they sent someone up and said it was fixed. Nope, it wasn't. By that time I just needed to sleep. So to remedy this I opened the patio door, and yes, I slept so that anyone with access to the partitioned but shared balcony (that is, 6 other rooms) could have climbed into my room. That didn't happen. But it did cool down.</text>

<text>Carpets look like from the 70's and the overall feel of the hotel is like a time-travel to the 80s.
Highly overpriced compared to other hotels in the area offering a better experience.
Aircondition is very loud, the big TV does not fit the overall room layout, and parking costs 12 USD which is a joke.< /text>< rating>

When you get a room in the main building the rooms are pretty nice and recently renovated, but rooms in the back and front wings are a bit dated. The room I had earlier this week was really musty when I walked in. Later I noticed black mold growing all over the ceiling. I requested a new room the next morning and the staff was very apologetic and quickly remedied the situation. Staff seems very nice.</Review>< pics>

The hotel was sold out and had a lot of preteens there for some kind of event but it never stopped the service and attention to detail. We had a little bit of a long wait to check-in but the person at the counter was very apologetic and kept telling us they will be right with us. When we finally made it to the desk they again apologized and offered us water. The water came in handy as it was a smoldering day. After a few room changes we arrived back to a lovely note from Charles welcoming us to the hotel and apologizing once more for the delayed check in time. When we went to the desk to thank him we saw him running around to help other guests and staff so we talked to the lady host. She was nice and listened to us and we begin a conversation on my outfit that she loved because of its color. 
Everyone at this motel had smiles and stopped to ask how we were doing. I felt like the red carpet was rolled out for us.</Text>

The hotel was a very standard crowned Plaza that had been upgraded recently. The rooms on the first floor right off the lobby weren't loud and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Within walking distance to a bunch of stuff which is nice and a reasonable price for the valley.</Text>

I stayed in one of the Jacuzzi suites. The room is very impressive with a separate living/dining area, and a spacious bathroom (separate spa and shower). The front lobby of the hotel is not the nicest looking, but the bedrooms are very nice and clean. Definitely would recommend as a great, convenient business hotel.</review>

Stay was a little pricey, including extra for parking, but I'm not sure there's much better in the area for less money.

The hotel has a bar and restaurant that I used. Service was good in both. The hotel has a pool, but I did not use that. There is also a courtesy shuttle to take you to points of interests.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel, provided it fits within your budget.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

when I checked in I wasn't acknowledged as a platinum member and was not offered a welcome amenity.  the key stay preference I submitted was a room away from the elevator and my room was the first room as you stepped out of the elevator. my room wasn't serviced the first day (I left at 9 am, and returned at 9 pm, the do not disturb sign was NOT on).  when I told reception the next morning, they didn't even apologize.  They were pretty dismissive.  The next day the room was serviced but my tea wasn't replenished in the room.</text>

The staff was friendly and helpful, and the room was very nice, clean and comfortable. Even though the price of everything in the bay area is ridiculously inflated, it is just hard to feel that a hotel is a good value when you pay that much per night and the parking and breakfast buffet cost extra on top of that.< /review>

My stay is nice. I will be traveling to the area quite a bit over the next few years... that is why I joined the club. My request for a bathtub was not met after going through all the trouble of making sure we had one in the room... and I looked for hot water, or coffee and fruit or small breakfast snack and could not find anything offered...</Text>

Went here for the brunch buffet. I liked the cook-to-order omelette, French toast, seafood, fresh fruit, and desserts. The selection is not amazing, but I had an enjoyable meal, and the service was good.< /Text>

< Review>
Stayed five nights for work and I've never been so happy to leave a hotel. It was 30 degrees Fahrenheit outside and my room was icy cold. After fighting with the heater all night (and not sleeping) thinking it was just my room I called and was told the broiler for part of the hotel was broken and no ETA on a fix and was given an extra blanket. I find out the next day from co-workers staying at the hotel there were space heaters available (no one offered me one) - some people even had two or three in their room. So I called the second night and was told one would be brought up. I waited quite a few hours and called again, I got a very un-inspired "sorry we ran out" with a promise to have one the next day. When I got back to my room after a long day I thankfully had one. The bathroom was still frozen but at least the bed area was warm enough to sleep.

Other than that the front desk staff was generally lackluster (one exception was when I checked in). The rest of the hotel was mostly freezing (we were meeting in rooms there and many had to wear coats).

The only bright spots was housekeeping, who did a great job, and the staff at the dining area. Maybe they should be running the place.</Review>

had meeting nearby, this hotel was convenient.  $12 parking per day is a bit of a ripoff.  valet guy in front was more concerned with checking his phone than making eye contact or saying hello.  room was old but had modern touches, overall it was decent but nothing to write home about.  You'd think for the price they would throw in a free breakfast but you'd be wrong.</Text>

Lighting was a bit dim in the room but it was nice to open the doors which faced the pool.

The staff, especially Hristo Baramov, were SO HELPFUL with the events leading up to my son's wedding, which was up in the redwoods above Palo Alto. I entertained my out of town guest very nicely in one of the function rooms off the lobby.  The renovations going on in the lobby did take away from the ambience of the place, though.</Review>

<Text>I was quoted 3 different prices, 3 different times I called to find out the price. The room rates change depending on how much they can get away with charging you. Night 2 was 2x the cost of night 1.
The room was not cleaned properly each day. Coffee was not re-stocked.
On night 1, I called the front desk and asked when quiet hours were (my room was near the pool and guests were being quite loud when I was trying to sleep). The response "oh, be as loud as you want until 11pm!" I responded that I was trying to sleep and was wondering when the guests had to STOP be loud!

We stayed for one night while on vacation in the San Francisco Bay area. The hotel was wonderful. We had a nice, clean, comfortable room. The staff were friendly and professional. The pool was excellent, as was the fitness room. My daughter wanted to spend every night of our vacation there, and so did we!< /Text>

Just needed someplace to sleep so didn't need anything fancy. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. Room wasn't ready when we arrived when we had asked for early check in, but the front desk provided us with an excellent spot to get breakfast while we waited. Plenty of restrooms throughout the hotel for when the room's bathroom was already occupied.< /Text>

At first, as I looked for my room around the back of the hotel, I thought I was going to be disappointed, but upon entry, I found the room clean and well decorated. The huge bathroom housed a large closet that contained 2 suitcase stands (I don't think I've ever had 2 stands in 1 room); extra pillows and blankets - and all the normal amenities. The bathroom had 2 frosted glass panels that allowed a bit of light to shine through to the main part of the room. I loved the high back guest chair.
We stayed at the hotel due to the wedding of a friend - and the ceremony and reception were beautiful! Staff was helpful and friendly. The only hitch to the wedding ceremony is that the silky runner they laid down on the stone tiles for the bride and her bridesmaids to walk down caused a slippery situation for the girls who all wore high heeled shoes. That was not well thought out! Otherwise, I would highly recommend the hotel!< /review>

<review>I like the free area shuttle of this hotel, breakfast is pretty standard, not free. Food is not much choice for people that doesn't eat pork. Room is nice and clean with a refrigerator inside but has  no microwave. So I dont feel special here. I also see that mineral water is serve as complimentary just one day. Expensive hotel I think. But I love the shuttle. Thanks to the driver for the pleasant ride.< /review></record>

Has a 24 hour gym and a decent restaurant.

Rooms are lovely/charming  and room service is fantastic as well.

Each room comes with complimentary sleep aids made from natural oils e.g lavender and eucalyptus.

They often hold small events such as a wine and cheese tasting.

Taxi's are readily available and can also be booked.

All in all a pleasant experience.

(Couldn't find a safe in the room however, which meant I wasn't inclined to leave valuables in the room)<//Text><userid>103567874055748262251<//userid>< response>

<Review>Our family had a trip to Palo Alto for both business and vacation purposes.  We needed a safe, family friendly hotel that would serve both purposes, and be close to the Stanford campus. This location does that and is about 2.2 miles from campus.

I am really disappointed and upset that I had to encounter Richard from the front desk on my wedding morning.

Prior to my stay at the hotel, I called in to ask if it would be OK for me to have a late check out on my wedding day since my bridesmaids and I had to get ready. The person who answered my call assured me that it would not be a problem.

On the day of my wedding, I walked over to the front desk to remind them that I would be checking out a little later. I encountered Richard, told him it was my wedding day and that I would be checking out late. Not only did he roll his eyes at me, he told me that I should have planned better and that this would have been a huge problem. I told him that someone told me that it was OK, but he kept talking over me - telling me that it wasn't OK and kept repeating that I should've planned better. Then he said he would have to charge me for an extra half day (which was fine). The only thing that made me upset and brought me to tears was when he kept blaming me for poor planning when I clearly stated that I had called in prior to make sure checking out late wasn't a problem.

I just hope that this doesn't happen to other people...especially on their wedding day. His unprofessionalism, rudeness, insensitivity, and mean attitude is not what I expected from the Crowne Plaza and has reflected very poorly on the hotel. I'm just sad that this had to happen to me on my wedding day.</text>

<Review>This my second time at this location. The hotel personnel were professional, friendly and very accommodating as to my needs for the hotel shuttle and other small requests. The room was clean and quiet and the bed very comfortable. The fruit and cookies at the front desk were also a plus. All in all, a great stay!<//Review>< gmapID>

My stay was good in general, great staff, very friendly. The restaurant cook very good burgers, specially the mediterranean one.

During my stay I identified a few things to get fixed. The room door wasn't completely isolated, for that reason, in the morning I could always hear people talking out loud and kids running as If they were inside.

The wi-fi connection, indispensable to do my work, was disgraceful! Slow and facing intermittent disconnections during the 4 days I have been there. You must fix that! This is Sillicon Valey, internet is part of the basics.<//text>

<review>I have been using this hotel for some years. There is for sure an on-going problem regarding the quality of internet via wifi (plus, the cable in my room simply gave no connection). The wifi is often down for hours - the signal strength looks good, but the connection does not work.
I have colleagues who started with this hotel, but are migrating gradually to other hotels, largely due to this problem - we all must have reliable internet access to work efficiently.
This visit, I have been frustrated with the internet access, and embarrassed in front of colleagues who I brought to the hotel, just to find problems with the internet. Please, please, fix it.

My other point, which clearly is a matter of my own taste, is that the restaurant and bar area is looking a bit dark and sad. There are few or no customers there, which I guess confirms my impression. I think it probably needs to be brightened up, made lighter. The big pillar in the middle of the bar does not help.
Please, take these comments in the spirit intended.<//review><rating>None<//rating>< Response>

Easy, quick and friendly check-in. Were part of a wedding party so we received a good block rate. After a long drive from British Columbia it was a wonderful surprise to get a room upgrade because of our IHG® Rewards Club Membership. Fabulous, spacious room with king size bed and a clean bathroom with toiletries, fluffy towels and gowns. Only snag: our room door had a problem locking when exiting but staff were on hand to make sure it was sorted out quickly and efficiently. Doors do need to be changed as they look worn out and old in comparison to the modern room decor. Didn't have time to use any of the facilities, but friends in our group had positive comments. A disappointingly short stay at a lovely hotel. If we ever find ourselves in Palo Alto again, we will definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza.<//Text>< Pics>

Good Points - Hotel looks wonderful from the outside, nice lobby and staff are friendly. My room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. I had a suite with a view of the roof.

Negatives - there were several. Shuttle to Stanford was booked on the wrong day. We inquired as to the delay and told no problem they would be there any minute. 5 minutes later, the problem was discovered and we were late for our conference. 

Next plumbing issues. My bathroom had a great layout with 2 pedestal sinks. The pedestal sink on the left hand side, the cold faucet leaked. The right hand pedestal sink, the hot water faucet leaked. Last night of the stay, at approximately 3:45am I woke to the toilet cycling on and off. I discovered the toilet was slowly leaking. Needless to say, when I reported this, I was told it was a known intermittent problem and they would have a plumber look at it after I checked out. Since I had numerous towels, I tossed them on the floor to absorb the water and turned off the valve at the wall.< /text>

<Date>1540771200000<//Date><rating>None</rating><Text>The hotel is excellently located with impressive exterior welcome and lobby. The staff is also friendly, but that's where the good experience end.
I was given (without being asked for my preferences) a room on the entrance floor accessible from an outdoors walkway with large window/wall to the corridor - creating a very "motel" like experience where I needed to worry about the security of the room. The room was spacious with a great bed and pillow, but felt very dated with carpets, furniture and walls in a very dated color.
The heating/AC system made a very loud white noise even when turned off (I can't sleep with white noise) and the management "solved" it by adding an electric space heater.
They were training a new employee at check-in, but therefore failed to inform me I needed a parking pass (I got a courtesy note on my windshield the next day and could fix it), and they also failed to register my work credit card (a user error according to VISA), though another receptionist could fix that the next day.
I'm also an IHG Rewards Member, but the only thing I got for this was a note offering me a free drink or some points, and two small pieces of chocolate on my 2nd day (nothing when arriving, and nothing on the other days).
This hotel might seem impressive on the outside, but inside (at least in the room I was given) it feels much more like an expensive roadside highway motel.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>Came here for Sunday brunch on father's day... I was disappointed at the poor service.  People left and right were getting served coffee and champagne, while we got ignored.  I mentioned this to the server who apologized, then the same thing continued.  The food was good, but that really put a bad taste in my mouth.
Not sure I would want to experience that again...so, no return...< /Text>< rating>

Your experience will be based on who is working at the front desk and what room you have been assigned.

A few bright spots....the property is very nice inside and out....the poor area being exceptional, with the outsourced Bar / Restaurant being an excellent addition. The Exec Sales team is stellar and if you are looking to hold a company function at this property, I have no doubt you'll be mostly pleased.

A few blights....the front desk staff is mostly cordial, but are we going to settle for cordial? It would ideal for the team to go above and beyond the norm, but this was not to be during this stay.

A few oh wow....while the decor and cleanliness of the rooms is spot on, the cement like bed and feather pillows that sorely need refreshing, are enough to limit sleep to 1-2 hours a night. Add in what feels / sounds like constant walking on the 2nd level and you're in for a long night.</text>

The service at the front desk was mediocre. I travel frequently and they were not very professional or kind. I was staying for a special romantic Getaway night with my husband and never did they ask about my accommodations. Also there was no continental breakfast. When I stay at the Holiday inn for business they always have breakfast for those who stay in their hotel. I also had to ask for my parking voucher. And when I was given drinking vouchers I ordered from the bartender when out of nowhere a manager came by and addressed the bartender no those drinks are not covered without even a sorry or word to me and my husband!< /text>

<Review>The hotel is conveniently located, and looks great from the outside. However, the rooms, especially on the Ground Floor, are extremely damp, and hence a big problem if you have allergies. I found the front desk to be extremely unhelpful in this regard, as they outrightly claimed there was no problem even and that they did not have a single other room available, both of which were proven wrong within 15 minutes of intervention by the hotel Manager. Overall, I found the situation was handles very poorly, and given the host of great hotel options close by, would not recommend this one unless everyone else is booked!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Large, clean rooms. Friendly staff. Heard about a free happy hour but didn't take part myself. Knocked off a star for the restaurant. Ordered a fruit and yogurt plate and got a thimble full of yogurt and an entire fruit platter. Frankly bizarre. They were very accommodating one morning when I was in a rush, however, and brought me over a quick bagel. Overall a nice place and I would definitely stay here again.</text>< Pics>

<text>The staff at this hotel is excellent and the price for the market is fair.  The room was clean and has plenty of power outlets for charging electronic devices.  The room also has an exterior area with a bistro table and chairs looking out to the pool. The room I stayed in is a little tired and could use an update, but was neat and clean.

I will book there again when in the area.<//text><userid>None</userid><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This hotel is located close to Stanford University and other local area businesses that I visit on a regular basis, so it makes the choice a very pleasant and easy one. Staff is friendly, rooms are clean and bathrooms have been obviously renovated. For Platinum members I would suggest the hotel chain to provide a complimentary buffet breakfast to increase the loyalty. Fitness are would need to be larger with newer equipment - they are outdated. Internet speed could be faster, but it gets email work done. For streaming purposes it's not fast enough. My overall experience is good, but improvements are needed to step up one notch in the tough market for pleasing business and leisure travelers.< /review>

< Review>
I was in town for an interview, and went down to the restaurant to quickly grab a banana. I realized I didn't have a hair clip for the interview, so I asked for the nearest place I could buy one......Julie, an employee, took her hair claw out of her hair, and gave it to me!!!! Then another waitress, ran to the back and quickly grabbed me a banana to go! They were awesome! ...and I really appreciated their effortts! Julie, told me to keep it, but I said I would take it back. Unfortunately, I didn't remember to take it back til I was flying out! ....I'll try to remember when I return!</Review>

This hotel appeared outdated and in disrepair. Our room had several items that needed fixing and cleanliness was poor. Would rather discuss this than type it all out. Have several pictures to back up our complaints.</review>

Came here with the fam, there is not a changing table in the men's bathroom which is pretty wack, come on y'all it's 2018. Pool area is nice the overall Cabana thing works but for $400 a night imma need better and more comfortable seating in all the rooms. They sacrifice comfort for design and style, but it's not uncomfortable. Staff is friendly and courteous and was generally attentive.</Text>

If you're looking for a hotel room with a clean lobby, nice staff, and decent restaurant food then look no further.

However, the beds are as comfortable as sleeping in a public pool area. The sheets were damp (hopefully from the laundry room) and you could bounce a truck on the mattress (ridiculously hard).

Now, too dress up the room and give it a cool vintage, distressed look the wall paper was peeling away in several spots.

Oh and rumor has it that the free coffee in the lobby is no longer being offered to help you recover from the terrible nights sleep.

I'm glad my stay was only for two nights.<//Text>

It was not at all a good experience, breakfast is not included for a room rate of $300, and even the room size is very small compared to any other group of hotels of same class. I don't recommend people here .</review>

<Review>Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by Crown Plaza's friendly and most helpful staff. Although we noticed some renovations taken place this did not interfere with our stay.
The property is well maintained and our room was very comfortable. We had a small problem with the heater in the living room area that was immediately taken care of by the friendly on-call maintenance staff. .
This hotel sets back off El Camino Real and is close to restaurants, shopping malls, Stanford University, Stanford Hospital and VA Palo Alto.
We had excellent service while dining but was served burned bacon and toast with a smile. If we had brought it to their attention this would have been taken care of however, it is very hard to complain when people are so nice. The restaurant manager was very kind and friendly and made our stay enjoyable..
We must say service was exceptional.and we plan to return to this hotel in the future.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The room was spacious and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and it was very quiet so we had a great sleep with the addition of the aroma therapy items.
The staff was nice and the afternoon cookies and fruit infused water were delicious! Wish we could've stayed her longer.< /Review>

The hotel looks nice and is generally in pretty good shape.  Our room was pretty old and not the cleanest.  The fire sprinkler nozzle was coming out of the ceiling, there were cobwebs in the bathroom and in the room by the window. Worse was someone in the hotel was smoking and set off the premise wide fire alar.</review>

<Review>Hotel is definitely older but service makes up for lack of decor. The front desk was inviting as well as the people who manned breakfast, and the woman who helped me get my free appetizers (redeemed from checking in on Yelp). I definitely felt like a guest here.

My room was facing the street and the walls are thin (I could hear when the guest next door was fidgeting with his keys and listening to music). The other things I was disappointed about was that I saw that they had charged my credit card for 2 nights stay (when it had already been paid for by the company). Good thing I caught it on my credit card statement and am currently waiting for it to be reversed on my card....

Everyone does seem to rave about the buffet (during the weekends?) and I have to say that I had a good breakfast experience as it was a buffet and they had ample things to choose from.< /Review><userid>104601529373289659747<//userid>< date>

Staff: Staff and service were generally excellent, with the exception of problems picking up room service trays.
Breakfast manager in particular was very attentive and welcoming.

Facilities: Room walls are paper thin and I could clearly hear every conversation and cough of my neighbors. Gym is tiny, poorly laid out, with antiquated equipment. Back half of the hotel has the rooms open directly onto the parking lot like some 1950's motel (which lets wildlife feast on room service trays that were ignored).<//review>

Not as nice as last time.   The front desk people were nice enough although, the room was a little disappointing. I didn't realize most of following untit midnight, therefore it was too late to contact the front desk.  First, thing that happened was when I was on a conference call to Hawaii.  I had my phone plugged in because it was a lengthy call next thing I knew my phone went dead.  That's how I discovered the outlets on the lamp next to the bed do not work.    Second, the refrigerator didn't work.  I have put some medication in there that needed to stay cold and about midnight realized it wasn't working. I had to get dressed and go get ice.  Lastly,  I go to lay down on the bed there's a big dip (hole) where people have laid before.   A big hump in the middle of the bed, don't they rotate these?  I couldn't believe it when you pay $200 a night for a room I would expect the facilities inside of it to work.< /text>

<text>I booked a two night stay on my wedding weekend. We were
Married in the backyard of the house I grew up in Palo Alto, and the cabana is just around the corner. We had a king size bed next to the pool. The room was just fine, we spent almost no time at the hotel, as we were very busy but the bed was comfy and the shower was good.

I was slightly disappointed with one thing, when I checked in I mentioned I was getting married Saturday night, I was hoping to get some suggestions about surprising my bride with rose peddles or something romantic. I asked the person checking me in if they do anything like that, and he handed me a menu to order chocolate covered strawberries, which would have been nice, except I forgot.

I guess that's my fault, all in all it was a good stay, and I would come back.< /text>< rate>

Front desk staff needs to be further trained to pay attention to details and know what is going on in their workplace.
Temperature in room and meeting room was in the 60s and could not be adjusted! I was warmer outside.
Food was not very good especially for the price; I ate elsewhere.
Room was okay with a view of the roof.
Bathroom was great with a tub that worked.< /Review>

The hotel is at a perfect location. It is clean and quiet. The staff was friendly, and the price was very reasonable.

Just one comment, I don't understand if the hotel has its own parking, why do they charge $12 for parking?!<//Text>

Room was very nice and clean. Couldn't get the makeup mirror light to come on. Had dinner downstairs the food was good and the service was excellent. The room service for breakfast was very good and right on time. The only bad thing was I wasn't informed that I needed a parking pass and I had a note on my car that it was going to be towed.</Review>

Overbooking beware.  Even with a credit card and call to ensure room was reserved upon arriving at 11 pm.  Room was not available.  And had to move hotels for one night -on my own.< /Text>

<Review>Hotel room was run down, with mismatched and scuffed up furniture. Closet is inside bathroom, and doors to closet and bathroom get tangled up easily. No safe in the room. Bright security light shone in our window all night, making the room too bright for sleeping. Fridge in room is noisy and comes on frequently around the clock, as does the noisy AC. Not enough towel bars in the bathroom. Shower floor is slippery and slopes sharply down to the shower drain, making it a bit dangerous. Breakfast area was understaffed and not clean, and service was poor. Not a great selection at breakfast buffet. Pool area was large and lovely--the only thing we can praise about our stay, along with the friendliness of the banquet servers at our event.</Review><Date>1411948800000<//Date>< Name>

<Review>Staff was very nice and our bed was good. We used the restaurant a few times and the food was quite nice. My chief complaint was the shower...I couldn't even wash my hair because the pressure in the shower was so pathetic. If I HAVE to come to Palo Alto again, I would probably stay there, but the showers just have to be improved. I know California should always be in conservation mode (I worked for a major water utility), but this was absurdly unpleasant.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Not sure why they call this a "cabana" hotel, or why our room was called a "poolside cabana", but the fact is, the pool is awesome and has umbrellas and a couple canopies or "cabanas". The bar serves drinks in plastic for poolside, and it was great to beat the heat of the weekend and stay in air-conditioned room and use the pool!</review>

I stayed at Crowne Plaza while attending a conference. The hotel is situated between silicon valley and Stanford university. Hence, plenty of thing to see. The public transport is relatively close, bus stops at the door, Caltrain is 15 minutes walk (San Antonio station). Hotel provide a shuttle that takes to to 5 mile radius for free which is superb.
The food at the hotel is sensational. I really engoyed it. There are also Chillie's, two Starbucks and other food retailers in close proximity.
The hotel was relatively old, but very clean and the room look as new. Staff were very helpful and kind too. :-)
Overall will recommend to everyone travelling to Palo Alto.</text>

We were at the hotel for a wedding reception and everything was perfect! The food was fabulous and the service was wonderful. It's been a while since I've been to a hotel for a reception but I was quite impressed.

We decided to spend the night and the room was quiet and clean and we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.</Review>

<Review>I called the day before our booking and she was able to get me 8 rooms, double beds, poolside at a great price. She was very polite and very accommodating. I was very stressed as we are a traveling vball team and found out that morning that we were listed for the wrong area. We were able to get the rooms we wanted and all together. It was a perfect end to a stressful day.< /Review>< pics>

My bill was under my door prior to check out, but I had breakfast that morning (~7AM). 2 hours later I departed the hotel, but stopped at the front desk to ask for my updated bill including my breakfast charge. The bill was not ready. I was asked if the hotel could email me my final bill. I provided my email to the clerk twice. After 5 days, I have still not received my bill. I had to call the front desk again, provide my email address again and hopefully I will not receive my bill.< /Review>

One of the most convenient locations in Palo Also, but due to supply and demand, the price shows it. Casual and quiet. Restaurant food was fresh and well prepared. Room was a bit dusty--a pet peeve--so lower than a perfect score.<//Text>

Solid hotel for the working stiff who is traveling on business. Comfortable rooms with a good range of sensible amenities and tons of outlets for nerds. Free internet speeds are decent and upgrades are available for reasonable rates. Staff is friendly and helpful. I'm not the type to run events at hotels so I don't know that side of things well but the ballroom-type event I acrually attended at the Crowne Plaza went off without a hitch thanks to the excellent staff.</review>

<review>I got a very cheap rate because of a bat mitzvah I was attending, but would rather pay the extra $50/night to stay somewhere else next time.  The building is pretty bad (at least on the floor where I stayed) and the random sets of short stairs everywhere are a total pain when you have luggage.  And no one was there to help me when I arrived, so I had to navigate three suitcases myself through a bunch of random stairs and doors.  Staff were friendly when I did speak with them, and the pool is really excellent.</review><pics>None</pics>< rating>

<Review>The hotel standard has really deteriorated. I have stayed close to a dozen times here over the last two years and in the last six months or so I have seen a real decay in standards. From the restaurant to the front desk to housekeeping, the hotel seems to be managed by a bunch of amateurs who seem to be going through the motions rather than exhibit any sort of passion towards genuine customer service. Toiletries are routinely not replaced, number of towels are three one day and two on a different day, restaurant serves coffee but there is no milk or sugar on the table, people like Marcus(?) in the restaurant serve you as if they are doing a huge favour, hiss at you  if you ask for vegetarian options (he actually said “I will do it once but don’t ask again”), front desk don’t even bother asking how the stay was at the time of checkout. There are countless things I noticed. What a shame. Just two years back this hotel was a genuine gem. It had people like Gloria in the restaurant and Tiffany in the front desk who went out g their way to make guests feel valued and special. For the price this hotel charges, guests should rightly expect much more.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>None</Rate><Text>Initial hotel room had no proper windows and was next to the airco Outlet causing a massive humming noise 24/7. In addition, power outlets were not working, power strips and cables were  sprawling all over the floor and the room had torn and stripped wallpaper all over the place, in addition to no proper room lighting except for a table lamp. the whole place felt cramped and tiny. 

Fortunately I requested to be moved due to the humming noise, but unfortunately that didn't resolve the noise issue as the AC vents themselves were generating a constant noise even when turned off. Room quality was a bit better but considering the price I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I was situated in the Cabana rooms. These are located out on the wings of the hotels and in my case on the 2nd floor not far from the front desk.

The good:
The room itself was nicely furnished, clean and very roomy.
Staff was pleasant and desk was staffed to minimize wait times
Located close to Silicon Valley

The not so good:
My room was not well soundproofed and at this price point, I expect better. I could hear voices and doors slamming late into the night, waking several times as a result. My neighbor was suffering some sort of bad cough that sounded as though he was in my bathroom.
Breakfast. All in, I added $19 onto my stay for reconstituted eggs, coffee and a sausage link. This same money would have netted a nice breakfast elsewhere and in truth, I've had as good or better complimentary breakfast fare in competitor hotels.<//text>< pictures>

Comfortable, clean rooms. Monday night there are food trucks in the parking lot which was a fun experience.
Cons are the additional charge for parking ($12 self park, $15 valet) Overall, I would stay here again.< /text>

<review>One would not expect motel style rooms at a hotel with the Crown Plaza license. Everything nice and clean, but I'd prefer sleeping in a room with a regular window, not the one that has to be curtained to shield privacy from the the traffic in front of it. Not a place to come back.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Rooms were ok, but customer service was lacking in several circumstances.  From front desk check in, to restaurant waitstaff, it was as if they knew people would book their stay here because of the central location and they didn’t take pride in their work, attitude or customer service.  It was very frustrating.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Fortunately I was able to find a room at Crowne Plaza. However, I searched over eight (8) hotels before I was able to find one that could meet the needs of my sister. I don't see the issue of having more handicapped-access rooms available. It would not present as much of a problem if able-bodied guests had to stay in a handicapped-access room. However, the handicap do not have the same option. It would be so beneficial for there to be more than 1 or 2 room available.< /Review>

<username>Bluesinger< /username><Review>I organized my 40th High School Reunion with Marisa of the Crowne Plaza and it really couldn't have been better. We booked the Cyprus Room and the attached Sun Deck. They put a stage in for our band and a dance floor. Catering was good and we had a cash bar on the deck.

The overall hotel is very good, beautiful pool area!
STaff was excellent!

Room: very clean and spacious, but two things need to be improved:
1) the mattress was uncomfortable - put in pillowtops!
3) the air vent system was terribly noisy, whistling, clunking. Kept waking me up every time the ac turned on.< /Review><user>None<//user></record></dataset><record>

They could not fine my reservations, when they did i got a sorry ma'am, did not have us on the list for breakfast... then charged me for to night, i was only there for one. And now the extra $360 they took out will take a week to get back to me. Oh and the valet told me to drive around tell a spot opened up, when we first got in.<//Review>

<Text>I spent 3 nights at this property. The rooms have nothing special.

First night I got to the room, after midnight, the heat is not working. Someone from the staff comes into the room and since there's a technical issue, they move me to a nicer room (larger). He checks the heat and says that it will take some time before the heat starts working and leaves the room promising that it will work.
20 minutes after, already after 1am, the heat is not working and I'm cold in the room. I decide to go to bed since it's already too late.

The next morning, I ask at the front desk to have the heat checked. When I come back to the room after a few meetings, the room is empty and my clothes are not there. I run back to the front desk and I am told that I have been moved to another room (WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!). The new room was smaller.</Text>< pics>

A very sensible choice of hotel, with a reasonable price, for the area. There is nothing here to dislike and a great deal to feel smug about given the price other hotels are charging nearby. The property and rooms are well maintained and comfortable. The staff are helpful and efficient. Wifi and parking were free, and there was a free shuttle service to the local area (which was not well advertised, but could be arranged from the front desk.)
If you pre-pay for breakfast, we found the 9 am cut-off time for the inclusive buffet far too early - we didn't make it once (who wants to rush to breakfast every morning when on vacation!). There was no refund for our unused vouchers and we were not told the timings on check-in. Aside from that, and the air-conditioning in the room which some might find a tad feeble, a very pleasing stay.< /Text>

I spent a few nights here recently on a business trip.
- Room was spacious, well-appointed and ambient noise from other rooms was not too loud or distracting
- Amenities were well-equipped and adequate for hotel traffic
- Location was great for tech company campuses as well as close to Stanford campus
- Parking was plentiful and traffic light at hotel entrance/exit made it easy to get onto El Camino Real during rush hour</text>

Hotel is nice enough For price and location stayed in one of there less expensive rooms wall paper was bubbling in several places. the location is great lot of space for different get together. Nice pool helpful staff, except for the restaurant down stairs. Ordered Al last carte breakfast, ordered fairly quickly didn't get water till 20 mins later. Did not see our waitress until our food came 30 mins after we ordered and it was not busy. Saw several people standing around trying to figure out if they should wait to be seated or grab a seat hostess was gone majority of the time most people just walked away 2 groups had to actually walk in the the restaurant and wave staff down to ask for direction. We all ordered eggs not worth the money spent.</Review>

Great hotel in Palo Alto with some unique history. Staff were great and made stay enjoyable, rooms are big and comfortable. Food Trucks on Monday night are different and fun.</Text>

Pricing is a bit high, but if you get over that it's a solid choice for the area with good amenities.< /Review>

We stayed a few days after Christmas and it was fantastic. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The front desk surprised us with an upgrade to a suite and it was beautiful. When we asked for a late check out they said no problem. I can say nothing but good things. We will return soon.</review>

I had a 3 week trip to Palo Alto starting in January. I switched to the Crowne Plaza for the 2nd and 3rd weeks and I'm glad I did. Food Truck Monday and great rooms made my stay very easy. and... the Beatles stayed there on the 8th floor.<//review>

Tiffany who checked us in provided very friendly and profession service to us. She greeted us with a big smile, answered our questions patiently, and was very helpful to my family as well as the small group of friends whom we traveled and stayed together. She helpfulness made our stay more pleasant.< /Text>

We checked in on a Thursday night. Our reservation had requested a room by the pool. We asked the person at the desk to look up our rewards number and she said she needed our address even though it was in the reservation. (Opportunity to think on her own.) The room key didn't work because the lock was broken or something. She called maintenance and asked them about any work being done in the room instead of moving us immediately. (Not the best thing to do in front of a guest.) We were then moved to another room but not told that it had 2 beds. We went back to ask for a room with 1 bed since that is what we reserved and wanted. Manager was called and moved us to a room with 1 bed. We weren't told it was a handicap accessible room. The shower came to our chin so we had to bend down to get our heads wet. No space in the bathroom to leave your toothbrush nor to hang your towel when you were done. Tried to order room service. They told us they'd have someone call us back. Several minutes later they called back to take the order. They got our order wrong and only sent up 1 order. The chicken was dry, overcooked and only slightly warm. The fries were cold. The air-conditioning in the room never got the room cold so we woke up sweating. We decided to check out the next morning only to be told that we would get charged a fee for early departure. As we told the staff member the problems we encountered, she said 'I do apologize' as though she was trained to just say it and not mean it. She then said I would have to wait to speak to her manager because he was in a meeting. I suggested she get him out of the meeting. The manager did try to help us but unfortunately his staff was incapable of thinking on their own and he made some poor decisions about our stay. We never got credit for the money we spent on our rewards either which adds to the frustration since we did have to pay despite all of the trouble. Overall it was a very bad experience after a 6 hour cross country flight.< /Text>

When I arrived the room was really inviting. I had a comfortable sleep. I went to work. I came back and noticed the room was unacceptable, first the do not disturb was on the floor, the sink was dirty, the plastic cups were out and were not replaced. I figured the cleaning person was really busy and did not have time. I gave her/him the benefit of the doubt. The following day I went to work and came back. I opened the door and the same items were unacceptable! I said one day fine two days is not acceptable and will leave this place and never come back if this doesn't get fixed.

The following morning I got on the elevator to go directly to talked with the hotel manager and found myself with the housekeeping manager, Mrs. Martinez. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the cleaning. She apologized and said this would get fixed. I went to work. When I came back not knowing what I was going to find. I was surprised to see the excellent work they did by cleaning my room. No further issues during my stay. I would definitely stay there again.<//Review>

We loved the spacious pool area. The bartender was very gracious and quickly served our party. The rooms are also spacious with a lovely aromatherapy sleep envelope that was a nice touch. Beds were comfortable and room was clean.< /Review>

Location is very close to Stanford University, so it is really convinient that there a lot of food around us. Hotel management is also very friendly that we were allowed to cancel the bookings of one of our rooms since few of our friends decided to bail the trip.</Text>

It is difficult to point out a single helpful staff member as everyone is always very friendly and welcoming to me. Two people come to mind which is Lee and Charlie at the front desk. The engineering staff with engineering helped me when I asked for help with the air conditioning in my room.

I appreciated being asked to be a part of the secret shopper program.< /Text>

Most Crowne Plaza locations are quite nice, but compared to the other hotels in the area, this place is comparable to a motel. The staff lied to us about availability, and the rooms are generic at best. You're better off paying the same price or less at the Courtyard Marriott nextdoor.< /text>

<Text>They have smoked glass in the bathroom. Looks nice until you realize how much light is transmitted into the room. I get up early, shower and go get coffee while I wait for my family to wake up. However in this room I had to shower in the dark to prevent from waking them.

Additionally the Cabana pool side rooms have exterior doors so you feel like the property is 40 years old.

The last night the air condition went out and the desk clerk said "sorry" and then just proceeded through the check- out process.

The rest of the staff were friendly and helpful.</Text>< rating>

<Review>This hotel is probably one of the most terrible and overpriced hotels I have ever been. Terrible rooms, one micro window with a view to the roof of an other building, old carpets inside and outside the rooms. Ac system had a noise all the time. And they charged for parking overnight simply ridiculous. It feels like a 30 dollar motel and they charge 349dollars per night.  Staff is nice and friendly.</Review><Name>Alejandra Arce< /Name>< Time>

My wife and I visit the Palo Alto and San Jose area 2 or 3 times a year. My wife's sister and husband live in Palo Alto and my brother lives in San Jose. When we visit the area we stay at the Palo Alto Crown Plaza. We have stayed at the Cabana many times. Since it ts a business oriented hotel, it is cheaper on the weekends than on the week days. The staff is attentive and the rooms are great. The only negative is that breakfast is not included.</Review>

Our wedding reception was here and out of town guests enjoyed their stay at this hotel.  Unfortunately, Charles Hall, Director of Rooms, is useless and does not return messages--irregardless if you write or leave telephonic messages.  The rest of the staff is very accommodating and friendly.  However, any person who is so disrespectful of paying customers, should not be in such a position.< /text>

Generally a good stay, aircon and fridge noisy in room, the later fixed by unplugging it! Very friendly staff at front desk, bar and restaurant. Pool looked great but didn't get time to try it out.

Rooms looking a little dated and seemed expensive, but seemed to be the going rate for Palo Alto</text>

Overall my experience was pretty positive. The hotel is nice and clean, well-maintained. The staff was awesome.

My only gripe is that I felt it was priced pretty high for the value I got - even worse when I found out they were charging for parking (which no one else in the area does). Also the first room I got was really bad (the tiny window looked directly into a wall) but thankfully there were other rooms and the staff moved me.< /text>

<Review>Crowne Plaza Palo Alto shows it age....décor and service lacking.  Cost is extremely high per night, including charging extra for parking and internet.  Did not restock complimentary water bottles or coffee/tea during stay.  Bathroom leaked from room above, internet didn't work consistently, dining staff was inattentive and room was noisy (hall noise, door to service stairs slamming during the night)and far too much exterior light coming from windows (curtains did not close properly) and around room entry door.   On the positive, it was conveniently located to place of business, and valet team was prompt with bringing forward the car (guess that's why it cost so much to park).<//Review>< gmap_id>

A good solid hotel that is close to the office.

Compared to other hotels of the same caliber, this hotel does an excellent job across the board.

Just remember, this isn't a Michelin 5 star hotel - but it is a good place to stay while in or around Palo Alto.<//Text>

Staying with my family, I expressed that they're were two adults and two children staying; however, they towels in the room were only for two people. The coffee packets in the room were decaf, not regular coffee.

Coffee in the lobby was empty and when I let the front staff know, they told me that it shouldn't even be there because it should have been removed an hour earlier; if they are not going to offer it, they should remove it.

Internet extremely slow, although it was included in my price, it didn't not matter because I could not download my mail; had to go to the Corner Bakery to use there internet and have breakfast there instead of the hotel.

I didn't see the pride of Crowne Plaza's as in other cities where I stay.<//review>

THE OVERALL STAY WAS GREAT, BUT WE WERE DISAPPOINTED IN THE BATHROOM AS THERE WAS NO PLACE TO PUT OUR INCIDENTALS. IN THE OTHER ROOM WE HAD THERE WAS NO AIR THE FIRST DAY. THEY CAME TO CHECK IT AT 10 OCLOCK BUT DID NOT GET IT FIXED. THE ROOM WAS CLEAN AND BEDS WERE GREAT. THE POOL WAS ALSO GREAT FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN.</review>

<Text>The hotel was well situated for my business trip. Unfortunately we could not book the hotel for the entire trip and had to switch hotels for the last night. The booking agent mentioned a 4 night minimum starting on Thursday but there seemed to be some confusion about it. Nonetheless, the hotel was well kept, the rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Ok so that just seem like a cool title there is no ugly but the bad my key card didn't work for the main door the 1st day and we had to wait until the 2nd day to have it fixed. This actually was a huge inconvenience for my father who's wheelchair could not fit through the end door. However this did not damper my stay because the staff did troubleshoot the issue and called me in the morning to fix the problem. This is my 2nd time staying in this hotel and both times I felt very comfortable. The hotel staff here is very welcoming and accommodating. I do not stay with IHG brand hotels very often but after booking the presidential suite and meeting many of the wonderful employees at this location I know I will be back. I would give this hotel 4 starts for accommodation and 5 stars for customer service. The staff at crown plaza Palo Alto are amazing!!!<//review>

Super ftiendly staff.  Peter the manager goes all out for both the guests and employes.  A secret, The Beatles were housed here for their last concert.  Ask for the rooms they sleep in.  Word leaked out and hotel was mobbed by hordes of teenage girls.  The Beatles left in a garbage truck, then switched to their limo.  This hotel when it opened was the finest hotel between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Very popular with Asian business people today.<//review>

This hotel was close to where my late evening meetings were being held so I chose to stay closer to my meeting place and not the airport. This worked out great, as the hotel was a perfect choice to end my evening, have a nightcap, and a great night's sleep before heading off to the airport at 5AM.<//text><user>None</user><Pics>None< /Pics>< time>

<Text>The great thing about this hotel is that it is set well back from noisy El Camino.

The hotel survey from IPSOS does not ask about noise levels in the room itself, just outside. Like most US hôtels, the air conditioning is very noisy, and the refrigerator, which is empty, goes on and off noisily all night long. I managed to turn the air conditioning off, though it still made some noise. In other hôtels I unplug the refrigerators, but that is not possible here. I was able to minimize the noise by turning the temperature control to the highest temperature setting.

Other than that, I like the style of the hotel and was able to find a good running trail nearby. (The bicycle trail into Palo Alto, if you look on Google earth.)</Text>< resp>

<date>1372636800000<//date><Rate>None</Rate><Text>I took a few days after a conference in San Francisco and moved down south a bit to the Palo Alto Cabana Crowne Plaza. From the photos it looked very nice, and usually when I just judge by the photos I'm disappointed. THIS HOTEL, however, was in no way a disappointment. It is excellent! The hotel is spacious and clean, beautiful setting. Parking lot was clean and easy to access. I was on the 8th floor and overlooked the pool and surrounding mountains. Very nice. Room was very clean and tidy. Bathroom was well stocked and cleaned every day. It was also a very quiet place. The pool area is the best. It is large, clean, very well kept. The pool was busy, yet quiet and nice to be at. There are shaded areas at the pool in case you want to avoid the sun. The restaurant was outstanding. I had breakfast there three of four days and it was very good. I had a later dinner there one night and the food was very tasty and cooked to order. From this property you are 10 minutes from Stanford and about 10 minutes from a very nice (and busy) "downtown" area of Palo Alto. Drive down there, find a place to park and just walk up and down the Avenue. So many things to visit. Overall this property is an A++. One more thing: All of the staff there were excellent. The housekeeping staff was very kind and considerate. The restaurant staff was "service first." The front desk staff was great and helpful. Overall, this is a very good place to stay. I will return, that's for sure.<//Text>< Pics>

This was a last minute booking, so I expected to pay more. I sure was surprised by the final bill! I was even more disappointed when the hotel room (one of the last few left) looked no better than a typical Holiday Inn. The elevator was loud, even though I was some ways from it. There are better properties nearby, which I was at the following day (and liked it MUCH better).< /Text>

<UserId.>115362898003952244191< /UserId.><Name>Elisa Lou</Name><time>1540269443670<//time><rating>2</rating><Text>I'm an IHG Platinum Elite member and stayed here for 1 night for business. It's not located in the best area, you'll have to drive a bit to get to some decent restaurants and shops. I would definitely prefer to stay in downtown PA.

This hotel does have many onsite amenities. I used the gym, which was spacious and has weights + benches + cardio machines, but no leg machines. Pool was there but didn't have chance to use it. Restaurant is open late, which is nice. There's also an area for buying convenience items like tylenol, nyquil, etc. which was useful.

Unfortunately the room quality was not good. I ended up with a room with a window that faces the outdoor walkway on the 2nd floor, meaning no privacy. I was too exhausted to ask for a room change since I checked in late in the evening, but this was definitely really disappointing. Because the window faced the outside, the sound proofness was also really bad. I could hear people parking and locking their cars while I was trying to sleep. I guess this is what it's like to stay in a motel room.

The ridiculous thing was that the room was priced at $445 a night for that week - not worth it. I understand they were hosting a conference during that time so there may have been a price increase, but it's still pretty unacceptable given the experience I had.

In conclusion, if you want to pay $445 a night for a motel experience then I guess you can stay here. Or maybe consider staying at a Marriott or SPG property, because at least they honor elite status.</Text>< pics>

Stayed at this hotel when visiting Palo Alto. The hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were wonderful, clean, dark for rest, nice temperature and great beds. I highly recommend The Crown plaza!< /Text>

Thanks to the staff at The Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto! You made my wife and myself feel so relaxed and comfortable. Nick and the entire staff were always there to help us in any way they could. We will stay there again.

I had a great experience here, I do feel it was a bit pricey for the size of the rooms and overall price in general.  Maybe it's just location that is overpriced in the general area.  Good bed, great breakfast and the hotel staff were so great and helpful!<//Review>

<Review>For a professional event, the ballroom is nice enough, and the food was well done, but the parking is kind of a nightmare. The parking lot isn't well maintained and it's awkwardly being the building near a shabby awning. Once inside the building, it's fine.</Review>< user>

We were going between Sunnyvale and Palo Alto so I really liked this location. We spent a day in the city, shopping, and the beach. One of the reasons we chose this hotel is the 1-800 staff told us the pool was heated. When we checked in we found out it was solar heated and there wasn't a lot of sun to heat the pool. My boys had fun anyway. I wouldn't get in! That was our only complaint.<//review>

<Review>Two big thumbs up because it is dog friendly, but two thumbs down for being too expensive during the week ad not offering extended stay rates. This is a 4 four star hotel charging 5-6 star rates during the week. Concierge did not have mail service (stamps for sale) which was inconvenient, especially since it is a known business hotel.< /Review>< Pics>

While the room was very comfortable, I could have used extra pillows. I suppose I could have requested more, but never had the time. I did like the fact the bathroom closet had a light so I did not have to use the nightlight I brought.<//review>

<Review>Best advice when visiting Palo Alto do not stay at this hotel.
Small cramped rooms. torn bed linens. sullen unfriendly reception staff. Include buffet breakfast was inedible. Better off to across the street.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The location is very convenient when doing business in the Mountain View area. The excellent hotel restaurant means that even if you don't have time to go out and grab something to eat you will still get a great meal right in the hotel.< /review>

<rating>None</rating><Text>We had a nice stay and the general manager was very friendly on site. The only complaints I would add is that we got the suite but they were unable to give us a key to the main room. We had to enter through the last door into the bedroom which took some of the suite appeal away. Everything in the suite was quite nice. The other small complaints and why I didn't do 10 on everything is that the breakfast eggs were made from mix or completely grainy. For $20 per person the scrambled eggs were very disappointing. The bar attendant was also not on her game and wouldn't agree to give a glass of champagne so I finally offered to buy the bottle but then the bottle which is $20 at Trader Joes ended up being $70 which felt expensive when I just wanted to bring up one bottle. Other than that it was a great stay and thank you.</Text>< pics>

The staff at Crowne Plaza Palo Alto were friendly and professional. The hotel was clean and, overall, served our needs. The bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows. We would recommend this hotel to others.</text>

It was like a suite...with a separate room to work in.  But the lighting was atrocious.  I had video conferences and I had to move lamps from the main room into the office space just so people could see me.  I'm not sure who designed it but it was a large room that was just wasting space with incredibly poor lighting.

I have had the opportunity to stay again and I've chosen to go across the street to Dinah's...</Review>< resp>

<Text>Very bad experience here! We booked 4 rooms for our group of 5people. 3 king rooms and one double/double room.
We arrived there around 23:30. There were just one lady to at the front desk. She was not good to checking people. Besides us, there were 5-6 people needed be checked in. It took almost 20 mins the lady make the checking in. Well, we got dirty rooms and there were no more double/double room. She just arranged to add a roller-bed for our double/double room! Our booking is said " guaranteed for late arrival".</Text>< pictures>

We stay at this excellent hotel because there's no room in the Manger where I grew-up - and the eternal City of Palo Alto is changing and my parents are growing old.
The amenities are top-notch but some of the mechanical equipment is dated - but/and they're always busy working to up-date things.

(The A/C was a bit noisy and sudden on-off, the in-unit 'fridge compressor mad a constant beeping if turned on -- and in the next-unit children and their parents were loud through the adjoining doors - but what can you say to loud people especially ones with children? Any type of mention only makes them louder...and angry.)<//Review>

<text>Too far from downtown PA, 20 min drive. Air conditioner didn't work, phone didn't work. Wifi didn't work. Rooms are way expensive considering what you get at $2500/5 nights. In-room fridge was empty, not even a bottle of water, for $500/night??? Breakfast buffet was barely meh at $20. Very disappointed. Staying elsewhere next time.<//text>< Pics>

<review>$250 Motel with lousy service. Don't stay here...

I stayed here on business travel and now I'm recommending that it be taken off their list of preferred locations.

The hotel is in need of repair and it does not resemble the ambiance that they try to portray on their site. The pool was closed even though the outdoor pools at neighboring locations was open. Throughout the hotel many things were only half repaired. It's as if repairs started and they ran out of funds.

There are garish lights positioned above every window that shine through the curtains. They would not turn these lights off but offered a curtain clip instead. The clips do not keep all of the light out of the room. I had enough light that I could still read my newspaper.

The hotel is an older building and the walls are thin. I could hear the elevators all night long. I could hear conversations in the hallways.

To top it all off they refused to help me with the billing situation. They were supposed to bill the employer and now they have billed both of us. They are argumentative and completely unwilling to try to help solve the situation.

The best part of my stay was the free shuttle service. The gentleman that drove the shuttle was also quite a good conversationalist.</review><rating>1</rating><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /gmap_id><user_id>117399321471262427786</user_id>< user_name>

< review>
I wasn't expecting high-end comfort when I booked this reservation, but I do like a clean, relatively fresh-smelling room. The hotel exterior and lobby are presentable and relatively inviting. We were placed in one of the rooms that faced an outdoor second-story walkway, with viewing from the walkway into each of the rooms, which gave the room more of a motel feel than a hotel. I don't think all of the rooms are set up this way, but this is what we got. When we entered the room the smell was almost overwhelming. It really stunk, can't tell you of what, just an old musty smell, probably because the room had no outdoor-facing windows and was constantly closed up. It was gross. The breakfast was ok, definitely overpriced for the buffet.< /review>

Nothing out of the ordinary, the hotel is a bit more cozy than your regular Crowne Plaza. The staff at this property is very good.
The location is very good, parking is great in the premises.< /review>

The hotel was packed for Christmas brunch and we just wanted a simple breakfast, the staff was very busy yet they managed to set us up in the bar area and we had a nice breakfast. Thank you to all the staff that worked on the holidays.m</text>

Do NOT choose Crowne Plaza Palo Alto, If you can choose Crowne Plaza Silicon Valley/Milpitas. 

The Overall experience in Crowne Plaza Silicon Valley are 10 times better than Crowne Plaza Palo Alto...

Crowne Plaza Palo Alto charge you everything.. 
80 dollars value no more.< /review>

Don't let the modern front lobby fool you - most of this hotel is actually an old motel with doors that open onto an outdoor walkway.  The room decor is dated and a little tired.  The HVAC doesn't work.  I am a Spire member, and have stayed at IHG properties all over the world, and I was shocked that this is the hotel offered in the middle of Silicon Valley!< /Review>

<review>I will be staying at the hotel again soon. In September I will be coming back for business and have already decided to stay at your property. I hope your parking in the front is better and I don't have a repeat of no shampoo or conditioner in my bathroom. Both were inconveniences, but wouldn't deter me from staying at your property again.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It looks nice but is average for any hotel in this price range.  The doors of the rooms slam shut and there is too much noise heard through the walls.  I would try a different hotel in the same price range.< /Text>

The rooms are clean but dated. The biggest problem is the noise of doors slamming closed at all hours. Better noise isolation it's needed.< /text>

We had a good stay. The only thing that spoiled it from being an excellent stay is that the pool was closed on Saturday for a special event. We had been moving our son all day and looked forward to coming back and using the pool.< /Review>

We've stayed here plenty of times and we typically have a great time. This time was no exception, except for the assistant manager at the restaurant, who was incredibly rude, disrespectful, and inappropriate. I'll head back to the hotel, but if I was the assistant restaurant manager I'll definitely be eating elsewhere.< /Review>

<text>The property is OK-- pretty average in terms of overall ambience and comfort. What was troubling with my stay was there was a loud, middle-of-the-night pool party. It took hotel staff a while to resolve the issue - basically intoxicated individuals who had broken into the pool area. I imagine everyone who had a poolside room got a pretty lackluster night of sleep.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Beatles stayed in this hotel twice, the last time was at the end of their final world tour. See the room where they stayed if not occupied. Ask the front desk.

Great location for attending Stanford events.<//Review>

This is a great value in Palo Alto; nice facilities and location.  Only peeve on this visit was that my room was on the first floor, and that meant no privacy since it faced the busy parking lot.</Text>

the value per money not the best but the prices in palo alto are expensive.
the breakfast is very very expensive and you get poor selection of food . bread and pastry dry and not fresh.
For $20 you should have a the best. continental for $12 that include coffee and pastry that in every motel you get for free. the breakfast is the only thing that bother me.</review>

At 230am the piercing fire alarms woke up the entire hotel and proceeded to go off for another half hour until the fire dept. showed up. Stuff happens. I would have liked to think a discount on a future stay would have been offered but oh well. I didn't ask and they didn't offer. Nice hotel aside from that.<//review>< Pictures>

Reception person friendly. Room mildew smell. Fan/vent in bathroom not working. Probably why room musty.
Toilet pressed up against bath/shower, akward.
Bathroom door inconvenient to open/close. Minimal TV channels, no movie or HBO, basic cable. Charged to park. Didn't like that.<//review>

I really enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto. I was staying for an interview and everything that was provided helped me relax and prepare for my interview, and it was in a convenient location that allowed me to go to the office I needed to go to easily, as well as meet up with friends in the area all by Uber.

The staff were very helpful and effective, and I cannot recommend this hotel enough.</text>

<rate>None</rate><Review>Second time Crowne Plaza in Pali Alto charged my credit card unjustly and for something that shouldn't have been charged. Using a free night stay under IHG's rewards program as advertised yet I was charged a partial amount that upon call to Palo Alto Crowne Plaza they admitted it wasn't my responsibility. Their accounting/billing department has done this twice to me where my card was charged for something that shouldn't have been. Beyond frustrated with them by now and not to mention the next morning while showering I realized the tub was backing up and I had to finish showering in a gross water backed up tub! Second time lesson learned that Palo Alto Crowne Plaza needs a better billing person or system. Just to be fair I've stayed every weekend for over a year and half in the Milpitas Crowne Plaza and they are on point in all reservations and charges. Never had any billing mishaps or problems with Milpitas.< /Review>< Name>

During an extended stay for work, I was placed in a room right behind the reception desk that was incredibly noisy. With that, and the uncomfortable mattresses and pillows in my room I got very, very little sleep!

I asked to be moved on multiple occasions, but the staff was unable to move me to a different room.<//Review>

<text>Back rooms facing the houses have bathrooms where the toilet is NOT vented. Sewer gas smells wide spread. NOT too sure this is fixable. Property is old and needs a complete re-do. Broken concrete everywhere. Property shows signs of real age and deterioration. Would really avoid. This is NOT a quality property. I would NOT stay there again.< /text>< gmap_id>

Charge me for self parking and is roofless so every time I park the car and was raining I was wet by the rain
I order a breakfast include and there no was way to do it

was necessary complain twice everything to have some sort of response.

the only excellent thing, is the service offer by all the buffet staff< /review>

<Rate>None</Rate><text>I was charged the deposit fees of $50.00 that the hotel forget to release and after calling them twice I was told that it was my Bank's fault. The 'accountant' also charged my card a dollar in an attempt to remove it and reversed the charges but it still did not resolve the issue. My bank make the effort to get on the phone with Crowne Plaza and after a Royal run around with the staff the customer service supervisor finally got on the phone and brushed me off stating they were refunding me 'and what more do I want'? Horrible customer customer, they did not bother to listen to their customer. They made the mistake not once but twice and were quick to blame my bank for an error on their part but would not speak to me or the bank about it. Rather rushed me off the phone saying 'she was too busy and needed to attend to other customers' I had not had an issue with them till now and the first issue I had it was handled absolutely horribly and unprofessionally. Customer skills are none and they do not listen to their customers. I wouldn't recommend for stay unless you have the patience to spend weeks/ days resolving the financial issues and are okay with horrible treatment from the staff.< /text>< Pictures>

Room was excellent although a bit cold.
Front desk insufficient. Not greeted as a platinum member, had to ask both at check-in and check-out to have my IHG member number included. Finally, was not offered the 600 points.</review>

Very comfortable hotel, great rooms and showers, and the internet was excellent. Only issue was that my room was close to the lobby, and I stayed over the weekend, and the noise level was very loud. Front desk stepped up to make things right though.<//review>

<Text>We recently spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza Palo Alto.

Positives:
Pool with lovely poolside lounge chairs and oversized bath towels,
Good value,
Nice selection at the bar,
Clean facilities across the board.

Negatives:
Charge for overnight parking,
Dirty glass in room upon check in,
Styling seemed a bit outdated.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We stayed here because we saw two concerts back to back at Shoreline Ampitheater. It's in fairly close proximity to the theater (minus traffic) and conveniently close to Stanford and shopping (i.e., Target, Safeway, Whole Foods).<//Review><UserId.>None<//UserId.></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Great hotel. Rooms are very modern and kept clean. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Free WiFi is 3mb/s, but I had no trouble using Skype. Does not have free parking, but if that is not an issue this hotel is a great choice for the Palo Alto/Mountain View area.<//Review>< response>

Hotel is nice and comfortable.
One should recheck the bill and the amount deducted from the card as the hotel deducted twice the required amount from my card and i am now running pillar to post to get it rectified.< /Review>

Dinner in restaurant. The food was poorly cooked and service slow. Chicken leg was tough.

Expensive food especially for poorly cooked food.< /text>

Compared to its beautiful modern facilities, the room is rotten, very motel-like.  It also took 3 calls and about an hour to get a shampoo.< /Review>

<Review>Unfortunately our stay consisted of:

Day 1 - Displaced from original reserved a room with patio near pool to 2nd floor
Day 1 - Short on towels
Day 2 - Loud noise from AC unit from 12am-3am
Day 2 - Weak water pressure 

All reported immediately and documented in the system for the manager to call me regarding our unfortunate stay. 


Thank you for the opportunity to share and provide
 feedback.

<Review>Terrible. See earlier comment. Bar staff totally inadequate for number of patrons. Social hour for two large reunions. Management should have anticipated the numbers and staffed accordingly. Also, staff not always able to communicate due to English inadequacy and too slow on handling payment.</Review>< pictures>
