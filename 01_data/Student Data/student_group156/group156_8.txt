Customer service was fantastic! The man who helped me did his very best to help me get the lowest possible price without trying to upsell or pressure me, and my tire was replaced so quickly it felt like a NASCAR pit stop. My tires were under warranty at Costco, so they marked the damage on the tire and helped me load it back into my car so I could take it to Costco and get my money back. I really appreciated their integrity and efficiency during a very stressful moment. Absolutely recommend!<//review>< Pics>

Took me in at closing put a new (used) tire on my van. Witch was better than all my tires i had on allready. Surprisingly from the time i drove up to the time i drove out was a total of 26 minutes. To top it off they charged the exact same price as the place that sold me the tire they replaced. I will never go to another shop again. They are never going to be replaced! Thanks a ton guys< /text>

<Text>Called the day before and was told the shop opens at 8:00AM. Arrived at exactly 8:00AM and was told by a rude old man to wait 20 minutes because they weren't open yet. Waited 35 minutes and the old man at the desk ignored me and walked out. When he came back after 15 minutes he told me i had to wait longer due to a late employee. I told him i was told the shop opened at 8:00AM and he said i could go somewhere else and not to come back. DO NOT shop here. Rudest service I've ever had. 1 star is more than they deserve.</Text>< pics>

Live in Santa Paula and try to do all my shopping here. I have been going to Daisy’s for over five years to have my cars serviced,primarily for tires, and have always recd good service This morning I noticed the low tire pressure light was on,and since I had recently purchased a set of four tires there, I brought the car to Daiseys to have the tires checked I was told,by I believe was the owners son,to move the car next to the air pump where he quickly  checked added air to all four tires.I was told all four tires needs air.I thanked him and was quickly told $2.00 for the air.I told him I had purchased the tires from him and thought this service was included and he replyed”$2.00 for the air” I paid him the$2 and left.  When I purchased the tires I was under the impression that problems such as these were covered like tire repairs ,I was wrong For $2 he lost a local customer and someone who always recommended to others to use Daisys Not about the $2 more about customer service and attitude you can find a better tire provider such as Costco  where the customer is put first<//text>

But it sounds like they wore out pretty quick so what we could do is sent them back to the company and see if they can do anything for wearing so quick.

<text>I went to daisy for some 8 ply tires on my toy hauler. Once installed I relized they put on 6 plys. I told em I didnt want them.  The service manager argued with me that they were the same rating as 8 plys and said he would give me $40 bucks back. I was screwed seeing as how they were already mounted. Fast forward 6 months and 1500 miles. The brand Is called Hi Run and there already balled and side walls are cracking.  Dont make the same mistake and buy there knock off junk tires. Cost was $340 same as real tires. I got scumbagged.<//text>< name>

I've been taking my Nissan Rouge and Chevy Silverado to Daisy's tires for several years now and have saved more than switching to Geico. Prices are awesome and the service is always friendly. If there is an issue with anything Eddie makes sure it's addressed and taken care of. The guys work hard and the business is honest.<//review>

I've only come here for new tires.  Except for not putting my after market tire valve caps back on, their knowledgeable and quick in that department. I'm going back tomorrow to get 4 more new tires on my Benz. Just have to remember to take my caps off myself before I get there.<//Review>

I had looked at every major tire/wheel online dealer and was told the rims I wanted to put on my "95 Jeep would never be available, "not made." My dad told me about the type of craftsmanship and good all around staff at this shop in Santa. On Dad's word I went over, talked about the rim and in two days had them installed. It is now the only place I go for tires/rims but they do so much more than tires. Soon here the motor on my 95 Jeep is going to have be re-done and when the time comes the experts at Daisy's will do that to. They do it all but what I like the most is I know it will be done right.<//text>

One of the worst mechanic shops I have ever dealt with, I took my vehicle and they said they have fixed my car because it was misfiring and paid about $2k for what they "fixed". After getting my car back my car was still misfiring and all Eddie did was delete the engine light code and suggested to keep driving my car. For some odd reason I didn't feel comfortable at all with what he did to my car and I took my car to a different mechanic. What they told me was so ridiculous!!! They told me that Daisy's tires corp never fixed my car and never put any new pats in my vehicle and showed me that my car was never touched. I had to take this guy to court. if anyone is reading this and I can help you not go to this mechanic shop and go through what I did I know I'm helping someone out, this guy doesn't care about your vehicle trust me.</Review>

<review>Bought a car from the little dealer next to the auto repair shop thinking this car would be better than my Honda with over 200,000 miles. The car I bought only had 88,000 miles so I figured,good car right? Nope! Rust in the radiator, broken rear motor mounts, and bad battery! Jiffy lube found the issues when I went in for a regular oil change. I supposedly have a 3 month/3,000 mile warranty. Daisy's needs to make this right.</review><userid>109717596339795315627<//userid><date>1473465757258<//date>< response>

Quick service around 9:30am. I went in to have a tire patched and was helped almost immediately. They imformed me the tire needed to be replaced and gave me a great price on a  Goodyear tire. Price was same as Walmart and Amazon, but also included the service fee!< /Text>

Terrible service. Would not replace tire that I had a warranty on because they claimed I drove on the tire. Which was completely false.
When they repaired my tires they left a lug nut off and would not give me an other one. Those things don't just fall off!< /Text>

Bought a pair of tires and only lasted a few hours and blew , the "owner" said he would not replace the blown out tire. This place has  Bad service, poor product and bad experience with bad attitude and a waste of money. This place will sell you bad and worn tires just to get your money and does not care about the customers saftey.  Iam ashamed and embarrassed for this establishment.

To your response ;
I did ask "what can you do?" and the answer i got was " nothing". And why would you let customers leave with a bad experience? The way you treat people tells a lot about the establishment. It only takes one time getting ripped off to NEVER come back.<//Text>

Fast, friendly, honest & fair - can I say more. Blew a tire on 126 late Sat night and couldn't release my spare tire due to rust so towed car to Daisy and luckily they were both open and immediately available Sun morning to replace the tire and fix the rusted tire hoist - all for < $100.</review>

< Review>
I came here a couple of years ago to get tires and wheels and the service was great just like the price. I was telling everyone about this place because they would ask about my rims. So when I recently went back I called first to make sure they had the same tires that I already have on my truck ( I love the tires which goes well with the rims) plus to get an alignment. He gave me the price and it was an awesome price for all 4 tires and alignment. Well when I got there it was a nightmare. I got there early to get in and out told the manager I talked to the other manager about wanting the same tires and alignment, he said yeah, yeah..and I knew from then he wasn’t really listening to me so whatever I gave him the benefit that he did. So when they brought my truck up they were not the tires I had on my truck they were very different. The other manager was in that I spoke to on the phone and he said they were the ones we talked about and I was like nope. I thought he had me in the computer from when I was in their before. But I guess not. Anyway he said ok I have those tires and I will put them on ( I could tell the technician was upset) I told him that’s what I told the manager in the morning? So it’s not my fault? So he brings it up again and they were not the same tires but whatever I just want to go. I paid way more than he quoted which may be because the tires were more expensive..fine! I left and looked at the receipt and they didn’t do the alignment! Grrr.. so I called him and he said they didn’t. It’s like was that manager in the morning listening at all?? So I had to take it back and get the alignment. Finally I think I am done and I drive away to get on the freeway and it was shaking like crazy...ugh! I got off the freeway drove back again for the 2nd time and told him it was shaking. He drove it to the back and said the weights fell off. Ugh... no sorry no nothing. I was like are you serious?? Acted like oh well. Spent half the day there. I was so close to just saying give me my old tires back, I will go somewhere else. This was a terrible experience never in my life will I go back. It was so different from the first time I was there. Now I know why the reviews are so bad. I told the manager  when I got there  about the tires and alignment and I don’t know if he thought I wouldn’t notice the different in the tires because I’m a girl or what? But the alignment..<//Review>

<text>The bad reviews are true!

Took a suspension kit for these guys to install. They cross-threaded a front shock and didn't even bother screwing the nut all the way on. The bushing came off on the road and we spent 5 hours with limited tools trying to wedge it back on, which, given it was cross threaded, was a painful ordeal. Now the front wheel bearing is shot, the car is no longer drivable and a castor kit and a bushing which came with the kit are also missing.

These guys made a lot of excuses, but essentially insisted that the shock DID NOT NEED TO BE SCREWED ON, that it was FINE THE WAY IT WAS, that the bad bearing is a coincidence, and that the castor kit and bearing were not in the kit that I brought them (even though the manufacturer sent me a parts list of everything shipped, everything included). They offered us $50 in compensation on the $1600 job for their negligence.

Unfortunately we will have to be turning to Consumer Protection Agencies, the Attorney General and our Visa cards to try to get some money back on the work they did which left us stranded on the road, with missing parts, a cross-threaded suspension, and our car needing to be towed to someone who knows what they're actually doing to fix the mess they made.</text>< user_id>

I've bought a few sets of tires from these guys. They always take way longer than they promise. Today I dropped my car off to get tires rotated. Eddie told me it would be 20 minutes. I walked down the road and got some lunch and came back 40 minutes later. They hadn't even started on my car. Frustrating. When I call around for quotes on tires they are always the cheapest but I think I will go with a more expensive quote next time. Saving a few dollars isn't worth the frustration.<//text>

<Review>****WARNING**** DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!
Took my 2007 Saturn Vue to Daisy Tires on 9/9/15. Spoke to Eddie and asked him to check all the fluids and to test AC system by running dye through because there was a leak. I let him know that we had just replaced the coils and spark plugs (all 6). 9/10/15 Received a call from Eddie letting me know that 4 coils had to be replaced. I reminded him that those parts had just been replaced and he assured me that they were not new and that they needed to be replaced. 9/11/15 Got a call from Eddie that the car was ready and AC was running smoothly. 9/12/15 Went to pick up my car and was asked to pay for the services done before getting my keys and being able to check my car. I was charged $675.50 for the 4 coils that were replaced and for them filling my AC. After paying, Eddie gave me my keys and a short receipt form his debit card processing machine. I went to turn on my car and check the AC. I felt hot air, gave it a little to get going but it never got cold. I asked the office manager to come check my car, he said it should be working but it is not. I asked him to please let Eddie know that it was not fixed. When I went to the office to talk to Eddie myself he then told me that if that didn't work it must have a leak. Whish is what I had said when I dropped off my car initially. He then said it could possibly be 2 other parts, one would $240+ and the other $350+. I decided to get a second opinion and left with my car. 9/22 Took my car back to Daisy Tires because coils 2, 3 & 5 were misfiring according to smog place. I left the car with Eddie who said he would fix the problem. 9/23 Was called to pick up my car and was told that he replaced coils and spaced the gap properly in the spark plugs. 9/29 Took my car back to Eddie's shop because for the second time we took it to smog and coils 2, 3 & 5 were still misfiring. (I have the picture of the diagnostic computer screen dated 9/29). Eddie again said he was going to fix the problem after denying responsibility. 9/30 Called shop to check on status of car. Eddie said that he had fixed the misfiring's and that the reason for the car shaking was the motor mounts. Took car home. 10/1 Check engine light came on and car was still shaking. As of today 10/6 I have still not received an itemized list of services performed on car after having requested it several times. I left a business card with my information on where he could send the itemized list on 9/29.<//Review>< gmapID>

would never use this service again. was lied to about tire size for my car by not one but three of associates. Wrong tiers were put on and when I went in for servicing on my car four months later at my dealership was shown how the tires had been rubbed on inside of tires. Took car back to Daisys and was lied to again and nothing done about it.(I had to buy 4 new tires) but not from them<//Review>

<Review>I took my Chevy Colorado the other day to get it aligned and one of the workers told me my rack and pinion was leaking and recommended I fix it by putting new boots to it. Well I personally checked it and took it to the dealer to get a 2nd opinion and I was told that the truck is perfectly fine and doesnt need anything. So even though are a little bit cheaper in price on certain things/services, they dont always tell you the truth...< /Review>< date>

(Translated by Google) Very poor quality alignment and balancing I asked them to do it again and they refused and the staff very pushy [Eddie] as if the service was free

It is always in perfect condition but they insist on wanting to make some composure to charge me more. I hope they don't put a hand on your car while you don't see it. Good luck on your next visit!

They were so focused on making me comfortable and safe while in their care. The attention and kindness Dr Kim provided me was immaculate. He is fun, gentle, generous and efficient. He is the most trauma informed dental professional I have been to. I seriously thought I was at a spa, being wrapped in a warm blanket while the tech lathered my lips with organic lip balm after my procedure. There’s a part of me that wants another tooth extraction solely to be cared for as I was at his office. Thank you again for all you’ve done this far, I’m excited for my return visit.

Because I would like to take a Uber home, I did local anesthesia but I did not feel any pain during the surgery. Dr. Kim explained to me each procedure, calmed me down and told me to relax my shoulders and take deep breath. I would also thank Carlos, who walked me through the whole consultation before the surgery and assisted Dr. Kim during my surgery. And of course , Emily, who played my favorite musician Charlie Puth’s  songs during my surgery and elaborated post-operative instructions to me. Thank you all for your patience and wonderful job! I will refer my friends to see Dr. Kim when someone needs an oral surgery.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>Was wowed by the excellent service provided.
Super friendly and polite staff and very clean and tidy office.

Extraction of teeth is not the most pleasant operation but the staff was very attentive and caring. Everything happened quickly and painlessly. I am very glad that my experience in tooth extraction took place in this dentistry.
Thank you to the amazing staff!
I highly recommend Dr. Joseph Kim to all!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The entire staff of Dr. Joseph Kim is extremely kind, always smiling and wanting to ensure that the patient is comfortable.

I had gone to get my 4 wisdom teeth / molars extracted and the entire process was so smooth. Kate was my nurse and she ensured that I was not nervous, felt comfortable and she was their with me from the beginning to the end. She even got me a nice warm blanket to keep me cozy before the procedure started and at the end when I was sort of sedated she put me on a wheel chair and dropped me to my car.
The entire experience was exceptional and exceeded all my expectations.

Dr. Joesph Kim was so calm and helped me relax too. He is a great oral surgeon, before I knew the procedure was complete and I was given proper instructions for the upcoming week to maintain oral hygiene or take any pain killers.
Dr. Joseph even gave us his personal cell number to reach him incase we had any discomfort and wanted to get a hold of him during off hours.

I would rate this place an 11/10. They are so so good.

Thank you to everyone from Caroline and the other girl (forgot your name, I am so sorry) at front desk to Kate, Carlos and Dr. Joseph,  you all are the best I have seen in 32 years. I appreciate all your kindness towards me.< /Text>

As a dental hygienist I am very selective about where my family and I receive our dental care. Dr. Kim and staff have high standards and have exceeded my expectations every time. Both my sons have had smooth third molar extractions by Dr Kim with minimal recovery time. I also have  had an implant placed with no complications. When a patient needs to be referred out to an oral surgeon his office is the first one I recommend. His precision and focus on detail are attributes that make me feel confident in his abilities. His vast knowledge of general health and skills make him one of the top oral surgeons in Northern California.</text>

<Review>Dr. Kim was quick and efficient in removing 3 of my wisdom teeth. He talked me through the process as I was under only local anesthesia by choice. Reminding me to breathe and relax my shoulders was very helpful and I would recommend everyone to use local if they don’t mind just pressure no pain and you get to experience the procedure!!<//Review>< Pics>

We have always been extremely pleased. Love his wholistic approach to health too. It’s not just about teeth for him, it’s about total health. Great, friendly staff. Welcoming, state-of-the art office. Thank you!<//Review>< pics>

I came in for a dental implant referred via another clinic. It came out a little bit cheaper than my previous estimates, but what really earns the 5 stars is the treatment, which was of unusual high quality. Doctor Kim and the staff have a great attention to details and I had a very positive experience from the first interaction till I walked out the clinic. Simply put, I felt the service was worth the price (which says way more than you'd think considering the bay area price craziness). Informative, helpful, service-oriented and prompt without being pushy.<//review>

<text>WOULD RECOMMEND DR. KIM TO EVERYONE!!!
My daughter had the best experience with having 4 wisdom teeth pulled! She was nervous about the procedure as people were telling her prior to the appt., how horrible that experience can be. She is also afraid of needles, so that added to the anxiousness.

The office is such a welcoming, tranquil, and comfortable environment that it sets the tone of calmness when you first arrive. Then the assistance are friendly and informative with prepping you for the procedure. One of the assistance massaged my daughter’s head to calm and deflect her concentration as they gave her the shot of anesthetic. Afterward, she commented on how appreciative she was that they took her anxiety away from the needle as she fell asleep.

My husband said the office was so comfortable for waiting; what seemed like three YouTube videos later, she was already done! They sent her home with a (silly looking but so necessary) chin band that held ice packets to her cheeks. She listened to their exact direction for keeping the ice band on, rinsing the areas with a plastic syringe they supplied, rested the first day, and took the prescribed medication as needed.

The first day she limited herself to jello and porridge, by the second day her cheeks were no longer swollen (off with the ice band) and she started back on soft foods.  Today is the third day and she looks and feels totally normal. But she will be cautious with eating softer food so she doesn’t trigger any set backs with her improvements.

Thank you Dr. Kim and your team! You have made this procedure one we will share with everyone (and a surprisingly positive one) that will contradict most other people’s past experiences.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

So happy to be Dr. Kim's patient. With complicated cases like mine he did outstanding job. Two implants and surgery were made without any complications. His office is always clean and stuff is nice and friendly. Dr.Kim and his team care about each patient and I can feel it every time when I go there. Highly recommend Dr. Kim if you are looking for oral surgeon you can trust without any hesitation.</Review>

<text>Compared to other dentist places this one had was very little wait time, and the ambiance goes above and beyond. Instead of doing the regular check-ups they get to know you and offer drinks( water, coffee, juice) in fancy glass cups. They also like to make sure your know the risk and responsibilities of each procedure, taking the time to clarify each step. Also everyone here is so down to earth, and really care about there clients. Would definitely recommend!<//text>< pics>

Dr. Kim and his team are the best! I would highly highly recommend Dr. Kim, and I don't see myself wanting to go to any other oral surgeon. I got my wisdom removed and my entire experience was spectacular-- from the consultation, to the procedure, to post operative recommendations. Their practice got me feeling They even called me the following day to check up on me. His team was polite, helpful, friendly, and understanding. Dr. Kim is such a cool guy and he was able to make me feel so comfortable I wasn't nervous at all. I partially wish I had more wisdom teeth to remove so I could come back!< /Text>

<Time>1584310721943</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Best medical experience of my life, no question about it.

I’ll preface this by saying I avoided getting my wisdoms out for years. I was terrified by the idea of anesthesia and losing control of my body, worried I would be in severe pain, and overall anxious to the point of nightmares over this procedure. If you’re highly sensitive and you need your teeth removed, keep reading: this review is for you.
With zero exaggeration I can say that every member of Dr. Kim’s team is incredible at helping patients feel at ease and taken care of. Dr. Kim himself is stellar. He has a sense of humor, he’s got interpersonal skills at a level that I find rare, and he’s got a steady hand.
The process on surgery day was easy and even the process of receiving anesthesia was virtually painless. Dr. Kim told me to “go to a nice beach in my mind” and that he’d be giving me “three glasses of wine.” I don’t even remember falling asleep, but next minute I had my eyes open to Julie saying “you’re all done! You did great!” I was shocked. The worst part after that was just the taste of the topical medication, which I masked with coffee ice cream :) I didn’t even take my prescribed medicine, I just took a lot of ibuprofen to control the minimal pain.
8 days after my surgery day, I’m able to eat normally again. I had my checkup appointment and everything is healing wonderfully. I put my full trust into Dr. Joseph Kim and his superb team. If you’ve got a referral for this practice, I urge you to go through with it. I feel so much gratitude for having met these medical professionals who totally reframed my idea and expectation of a procedure. I think I will be much less fearful in the future because of how positive this experience was. It even costed less than I expected (I have delta dental PPO). Lavina, Diana, Marcella, Dr. Kim, and everyone else who contributed to my experience: thank you thank you thank you.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Just survived a surgery I was scared to death. Dr. Kim is amazing. He and his team have been cheering me up the whole process. Like all previous procedures contacted by Dr. Kim, this one went smoothly. I'm so grateful for being his patient and for all outstanding work he's done for me for all these years. Highly recommend Dr. Kim to anyone who is looking for oral surgeon that can be trusted without any tiny little doubt.<//text>

Dr Kim is the best oral surgeon in Silicon Valley. Dr Kim has provided me several implants over the years. He is an expert at growing bone and uses the highest quality implants. Almost no pain. He is an industry expert, teaches other oral surgeons and writes papers. Very personable. I feel very comfortable through the entire process.< /text>

Every time I show up for my appointment they treat me as if I was friend and not a client. Dr. Kim himself took time to explain the procedure thoroughly so I completely understood what I was in for. Joy who assisted Dr. Kim provided me with multiple option on what I could do also what my expenses would be. During this process she did not pressure me in one direction or another, she simply did her best to make sure I was fully aware of the outcome of each option. Last Dr. Kim whole staff was amazing to interact with I would High Recommend any one who needs oral surgery choose Dr. Kim< /Text>< pics>

I had all four wisdom teeth removed very recently and my sister suggested we’d go to Dr. Kim saying he’s the best in the Bay Area. In all honesty, I say he’s the best in the whole wide world! I’m not gonna elaborate on it further, I highly recommend you go find out yourself!
Have a good one.< /Text>

I was really grateful that Dr. Kim got referred to us by the general dentists at Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry. I would highly recommend Dr. Kim to anyone.<//Review>< username>

Wisdom teeth removal with Dr. Kim was fast, uncomplicated, and very little bleeding after surgery. After lots of drinking water, ice on cheeks, and rest, barely any swelling and recovered quickly.  Staff was very nice and would recommend to anyone in need of removing their wisdom teeth. :)</Review>

Had my upper wisdom teeth removed here. Dr Kim was great. Super fast and didn't feel anything but the sedation shots at the start. I was very positively surprised with the experience, especially because I had had a bad experience with my lower wisdom teeth a couple of years earlier (with a different doctor). Staff are very friendly and helpful as well.</Text>

<Review>At first he seemed like he would be great.  However, when we went to show up for our daughters surgery appointment and the "copay" was almost more than half of what they told us would be our cost. Original patient estimate was $568.  When we came in (at 6am!) they said we owed almost $900.  When I said that I had an issue with that the doctor came out in a very loud tone saying he didn't appreciate me coming in and not keeping my end of the "bargain".  I told him that it was their responsibility to contact me before the surgery to let me know of the increase in cost.  He told me it was my responsibility to contact the insurance.  Never have I had to do that nor have I ever experienced given a patient estimate that goes up more than 70%! Then he proceeded to tell us that the reason he charges more is so that "if" the insurance doesn't charge as much he can give us a refund so "everyone is happy".  This was all being communicated through yelling at us.  Wouldn't even let my husband speak.  He kept repeating to me how he didn't appreciate what I did and how he had to pay his staff an extra hour because of me. As a service provider my expectation is not to be scolded for a mistake that his staff made and not communicating but rather to care for the patient, our daughter. Then he said lets just do the surgery at the original copay amount and that he wouldn't be responsible if the insurance contacted me later with a bill. There was no way in the WORLD I would have let him touch my daughter after all of that.  An all the while our daughter is sitting there listening to him yell at her parents which really upset her. He honestly showed himself as shady and not trust worthy.  I am going to report him to my insurance company.  I felt really bad for the front desk lady whom seemed to be very concerned for us and worried about the after math.< /Review><date>1453519096948<//date><rating>1< /rating><GmapID>0x808fb6dc310c18c3:0x27fba1700dda540d<//GmapID>< Pictures>

Dr Kim is a very positive and energetic doctor with good sense of humor.  We had a tight schedule, his team managed to squeeze Sandy's surgery appointment to a very early appointment within two days.  He helped to remove 4 wisdom teeth for my daughter. The whole process is very smooth and fast. Everything was explained very clearly to us about the surgery, and what need to be done before and after.<//Review>

<text>I was referred to Dr.Kim by my general dentist for tooth (fractured molar) extraction. I got same day appointment for consultation and after discussing with Dr. Kim, I decided to go with his recommendation of extraction and placing the implant at the same time. I got the extraction and implant done on the following day.  Dr. Kim and his staff are excellent. I am concerned about implants in general.  Dr. Kim and his staff are very patient and explained every question I had with respect to the procedure options and associated costs and why some of the procedures are needed. The front office staff and clinical staff are very professional and courteous. The procedure went well.  Dr. Kim explained the procedure and during the procedure (local anesthesia), he was explaining every step of the way.  Today is second day after the procedure. On the day of the procedure after the anesthesia wore out, I had slight pain, but that got subsided by late evening. Today no pain or soreness. Overall it is very positive experience. I will do another posting once the implant heals and a crown is placed as that is the actual result I am interested.< /text>< Date>

<username>Ferne Ran<//username><review>He was an hour later for my appointment,as far as I remember he didn't
t even apologize, then he checked my tooth without wearing gloves or mask, that made me really nervous, this is not a third world country where people perform dental surgery on the side of the street, plus I don
t know if he washed his hands or not.
He started talking to me in a condescending manner, he talked in slow motion and asked me about if I know what 'nerve' is...
He asked me if I know what 'nerve' is!
It's just bluntly rude to judge minority female patient like that.</review><GmapID>0x808fb6dc310c18c3:0x27fba1700dda540d< /GmapID><userid>100076724176617731356<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Went in looking for solo board game. Based off my likes employee recommended Bargain Quest. I liked how this sounded and there is a solo play expansion. I've played it four times and it's my current favorite game. Recommend the store and the game.< /text>

I have traveled to Games Empire (SD), Games Odyssey (Pasadena), Warp Rider Games (SD), Claremonts Gamesworkshop (SD) and I plan to explore more stores. At Ease Gaming takes the cake thus far by far! I was well pleased with the widely spaced isles and the amount of miniatures and other board games present was impressive. Their miniature focus seems to be GW focused (40k & AoS) however there is a reasonably even amount of many other games such as Star wars Legion, Conquest, Bolt Action, Marvel Crisis, Dungeons and Dragons and further more I cannot recall because there is simply so much! The employees are genuine hobbyists themselves like most shoppers visiting the store which always leads to great conversations for nearly whatever topic you can think of. The shop itself feels real clean and profession in all aspects. It is so far the only game store I've returned to for the 8th time now and I'm not local...in fact 120 miles away which only further voices my praises for the place. 🙂<//text>

Excellent game store. The people who run it love games, are knowledgeable about their stock, and work to foster a positive attitude in the store.

If there is anything negative to say about it, the place is a victim of its own success. It moved in January of 2014 from a much smaller location to the current location. Within a year, it was absolutely packed on some nights, especially Wednesday nights. This is a testament to the owners and staff, and they could easily another 25% of gaming space some nights if they had it.

It is a great place and well worth a visit.< /Text>

Came across the store organically and had to stop in on a Saturday just before noon.  The store had a nice crowd as they were having a tournament in the back of the store; very cool atmosphere and Hadrian was our cashier.  Really impressed with how clean the store was and the nice variety of products on hand.  Really wish we had a store like this in Chandler, AZ!< /Text>

This is a large store with a huge selection of tabletop board games, card games and miniature paints. This place is fantastic and is worth checking out if you are into tabletop games, or are just curious!
There are lots of tables for tournaments and they have a calendar with dates of specific events and tournaments that are hosted by this store. The customer service is great as well!</Text>

<Review>Small selection of craft beer and plenty of tables suitable for board games. It's an added bonus that it's adjacent to and shares a door with a game shop that sells pieces for games like Warhammer and the like. A solid choice for game night with your friends.</Review>< Rate>

I visited this evening for the first time as an out of town visitor. What a great store!  I was mostly looking for specific cards for the game Magic the Gathering. Not only did they have single cards organized by card set, but in my specific case they had already pulled all the cards for the tribe I was interested in collecting!  Prices were more than reasonable.  No issues with smell (yes, the stereotype can be true sometimes) and the layout is open and well decorated. The recent addition of the pub next door with an inside entrance between the two is just over the top in my opinion.

I am quite proud of my friendly little game store back home, but I have to admit a little jealousy when I stepped into this place.

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I came here to look and maybe buy a new board game, but left empty handed. The shelves are bit hard to look through and the games are priced higher than they are on Amazon. I was also looking for a specific game and was unable to find. That being said there was a good selection of games and plenty of tables for people to play. Even at 9pm there was a good crowd  playing there.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dbfa33e67e8c39:0x9aec578e1c994be4<//gmap_id></record>

Definitely the best game store in San Diego! They have a great variety of products and if you are looking for something they do not have, they'll order it for you. They also hold events regularly so their is always something to participate in. Make sure to check them out!</text>

<Review>Played MTG draft here. Called Judge for ruling. Opponent flipped up and threw cards at my face and said "concede". I threw cards back at him and we both were asked to leave. I sit outside, management comes over with bluff of owning entire shopping complex and threatens me calling property management for private property control. I understood his concern and simply asked for equal human being treatment. I then offered to make the other guy to leave the store first which he immediately refuses. I waste one hour outside. Even after one hour, does nothing about it.< /Review>< rate>

Seems like a pretty happening place! When I stopped by there was a sanctioned Magic tournament going on. Their selection of sealed decks was pretty slim, but it may just because they're moving lots of product...< /text>

If you're just coming to hang out or purchase product, this place is just fine, but if you're looking for good tournaments and decent prizes, go elsewhere.  Dixon and the crew are dedicated and pleasant, and have done all they can to help the MTG community, but... :/<//review>< Resp>

Reward point system is nice and the staff seems knowledgable about most things in the store. Tournaments run out of AEG are well organized and often, and a calendar is posted in the play area for ease of finding game events.  They also have a growing library of house games for in store play for those who want to test drive a game before purchase.  All-in-all a great place to hang out and enjoy yourself.  They also have a bathroom but it is quite small.< /text>< pics>

<text>A pretty average game store. Staff ranges from genuinely friendly to apathetic and sarcastic. The affiliated bar next door is ok but needs better food options.  The play space is really nice and clean. The selection of boardgames is one of the worst in the county and seems to to decline every time I visit.</text><userid>100450937393743291558<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Nice, friendly and highly knowledgable staff with plenty of tables and lots of space.  The game selection is to die for with every type of game represented!  They have books, manuals, figures, board games, card games, RPG games, table top games, etc...  I felt as if I could have spent all day just reading each game title.

The prices are pretty good with a bonus if you get their five star card that sends you text coupons for up to 20% off.  20% off!!!!  This is awesome and I've taken advantage of it a number of times.  Plus the more you buy and the more times you visit you earn points that give you more discounts!
Just a great place all around!</text>

I absolutely love this place. Where do I begin?

The store's selection is formidable. Honestly they do a very good job with the space they have to carry a wide variety and sufficient supply of games while not over-crowding the store as well. Also, if there's every anything they don't have in stock, they are more than willing to order it for you and give you a phone call when it comes in.

The atmosphere is friendly and inviting. There are several game tables, some specifically for warhammer and the like, and several folding tables in the back. Whenever I've gone into the store, there are people of all ages. The display case on the side showcases some of the models their resident model painting guy has done, and they are simply amazing.

The prices are MSRP for whatever they've got. I can't imagine it being very easy to keep a game store in business. I've never seen anything on "sale" but with the way I've been treated every time I come in, I want to pay retail price if only just to support this place.

The staff are warm, welcoming, friendly, helpful, patient, and just plain cool. There have been times when I've come in and asked if my D&D group could borrow a table for a few hours, as long as they're not already being used for an event, and they've been very kind and gone so far as to even help set up a good space. I've ordered two gaming mats, I just put down my name and number, and when the mats arrived, I received a friendly phone call, and I came to pick them up. They're just nice and super friendly. I like to think myself observant, and I've noticed them treat other customers with the same courtesy whether they end up buying anything or not. Please be good to them when you visit the store!

All in all, I've had nothing but good experiences with At Ease Games. True, it's usually cheaper to go online, but good game stores are few and far between, and At Ease deserves our support!< /Review>

A great place, employees are all helpful, and the FNMs are amazing. The only downside are the sell prices, which are 50% card value and in store credit only</review>

< Review>
Beer and games? What? Yes. This gamestore is attached to a bar with plenty of tables for games, whether it's warhammer, D&D, X-wing, MTG, or any of the hundreds of boardgames, there is plenty space to play your favorites with friends with a pint in your hand!</Review>

Burgers, Carrot 🥕 juice, gluten free buns are actually good, they have choice of beef turkey bison AND lamb I like them all. What could be better? The french fries. Part of the issue is they don't salt them (you have to salt them), but even adding salt doesn't make them great. I wish they'd improve their fries, and this place would be def be GREAT. I'm always a little sad the fries don't live up to the burger.< /text>< pictures>

Friendly team members, delicious and fresh good along with consistent quality. Any time we are on the west side we stop at the one on Olympic. I love the off menu Chad's Favorite which is a veggie burger with grilled sliced turkey slices on top. One of my favorite burgers anywhere. The turkey burger was fresh made and also tasty. Fries were not too salty and cooked just right and the onion rings were also cooked perfectly. Thanks for another great meal after 15+ years of eating there!</Review>

He's so genuine and selfless. The rest of the staff is great too, very friendly. The food is amazing, very fresh and much healthier than you'd find at most restaurants.

<Review>Bomb! The burgers were super bomb and the sweet potato fries were sooo good. Honestly, among the best I've had. The staff was really nice, gave us plenty of ketchup (lol!) and the other hot sauces were bomb as well. We still can't eat inside (city order) but the tables outside were just fine and the staff was super nice about it. Definitely recommend, it was our first time there but my girlfriend and I both left saying "that was bomb" lol<//Review>< gmapID>

Once I walked in I was greeted by a really nice girl,  she sat me down right away and explain all the different kinds of burgers they have I thought that was really nice. I was really hungry so I decided to get one. I have to say the burger was really good and the fries were fire! The cool thing about the whole experience was that they gave me these black gloves so I wouldn't have to worry about the the juices from the burger getting all over my hands. The other thing I thought was cool is that they serve beer and I love a good beer with my burger. If your in the area I highly recommend checking this place out!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I was going to give them four stars until I got my bill and saw that they charged $2 for getting cheese on my burger. Would've gotten my burger without cheese if I knew that! I got the Sunset burger with a fried egg. It was pretty good. Tasted like a homemade burger and it was exactly what I expected it to taste like. Nothing too crazy or special but just right<//Review>< pictures>

<text>This is a new spot in the valley with burgers and wings. I had the classic cheeseburger and wings both which were great! The fries was 100 and the atmosphere very inviting. The staff was very nice and very attentive to their customers. Definitely my go to spot when I'm in the area! Parking is rough but the food and people are worth it :)< /text><pics>None</pics>< time>

I ordered the burger with cheddar cheese and avocado with a side of fried zucchini’s. One of the best burgers I have ever tasted. The fried zucchini’s were crispy and freshly made. Delicious!!!!< /Review>

I got the chicken and steak plate, it was pretty cheap considering the amount of food I received. The chicken was well cooked, and so was the beef. My brother got a bacon cheeseburger, and he really enjoyed it. He got quite a bit of fries as well, although I recommend just getting the combo, it's cheaper. The service there was amazing as well out cashier was very nice and polite.< /Text>

We ordered burgers and fries and they all were prepared as requested and were hot when we picked them up. It is a very reasonable and good quality takeout option if you want to have a nice lunch/dinner in the comfort of your own home.< /text></record>

I really enjoy the Super Duper's burgers and sandwiches. Their garlic fries are very good as well. Recently though, I tried their Veggie burger and for a person who stays away from veggie burgers anywhere, this one is to die for. I find myself ordering the veggie burger more than I thought I would. That combined with the garlic fries is the perfect combo for me right now. I would recommend it for anyone. (even people who do not normally order veggie options like myself)</Review>

One of the best burgers in LA! They use such fresh ingredients and have such a diverse menu. Anything from burgers to smoothies! You can get anything you want and you don't feel gross or greasy afterwards. I have been coming here with my dad for years, the food has always been amazing, and the staff is so wonderful. They even know our names because we come here so often!</review>

This place is my first choice restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. Whenever  I I need a fair supper, this is the place that comes first to my mind. extremely good and all kinds of  food and a rich cuisine.well mannered staff, and good mood. In addition to that, the pay is good. I recommend this place with great pleasure.</Review>

My favorite burger spot in da town!  Good Stuff Burgers  Completely scrumptious. It is a "must try!"  I was on my lunch and had to eat it too fast...:(. This is one you need to take your time with and chew slowly to allow all the juices to flow through your mouth. I can't wait to go back to this spot!! Good Stuff Burgers<//Review>

Post and pre work out keto station !! My fav has always been super duper house salad with lots of cheese , beef patty, bacon , avocado in it. The place was cheap and the line was easy to cut short (they have nice logistics / service design that makes everything easy)

The burgers here are juicy and delicious. It has a very casual atmosphere and is a fun place to come and have lunch every now and then. Ensure you don't wear a white shirt though, the juicy burgers may make it not so white anymore...< /Text>

<text>Well, I don't think you are going to find a better quality of meats for burgers. Perfection. A one of a kind place that smells clean and has staff that don't turn over. They remember names often and again, worth giving a try.<//text>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>If you're looking for really good food then Good Stuff Burgers is a no-brainer. I absolutely love their burgers (it reminds me the one my mom used to make). It has calabrian chili, citrus, thai basil and onion seeds. It's totally worth cost me. The burgers are seasoned to perfection, full of flavour and always leaves you craving for more. You never want to stop eating at Good Stuff Burgers (I could have Good Stuff Burgers on any day). If you have never been, then you have no idea on what you're missing out on.</review>< pics>

One of the best “quick” burger shacks around - it’s not fast food like IN-and OUT, but it’s not trying to be hi-end like UMAMI. But what they do, they do really really well. Only complaint is that they’re located in a dead zone on Olympic in West LA. Whenever someone asks for a good burger place is, they’re in my top-3.< /review>

I will never trust any reviews again. Most all are fake on all forums and this restaurant is probably no different because it's below average on all accounts. After getting burned on Amazon fake reviews, Yelp fake reviews and Google fake reviews two times this week, I'm convinced you have a better chance choosing randomly than you do counting on reviews.<//review>

The burgers here are great, but I'll never come back. The last time I was here, my mom and I enjoyed burgers and fries and figured this is the spot. Later, when we were home, my mom checked the receipt and the cashier rang a bag of chips in addition to our order. I then recalled that the cashier was eating a bag of chips as we were seated. The burgers are delicious here, but thanks to that cheating cashier, I'll never eat them again, based on principle.< /Review>

Pic speaks for itself. When I first found this place I was so addicted. Their burgers are light and fresh. I love their fried zucchinis together with the burger, I usually order the large size. I went so frequently in the past when I lived nearby, sometimes for both lunch and dinner. They have a variety of healthy salad options and smoothies, which is great for healthy conscious people. But for me, I don't want healthy, the 5 stars are only for their burgers, side orders and very friendly staff members. I have never tried their healthy options and never will.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Great healthy conscious food choices here. The only issue I encounter eating here for the past 2 months is that their French fries are never consistent. Most of the time they come out very saggy and if you ask them for crispy fries to counter that, then they throw in a older fries for a long time and they come out full of oil and burned.< /text>< Pictures>

The Fried Zucchini Parmesan fries are pretty great! Last time I went I got the Avocado, Bacon, & Cheddar Burger wrapped in lettuce (Protein Style) and it was very delicious! Thick cut bacon and a very nice sized burger overall, even without the bread. Good prices and a simple menu makes this a pretty solid burger spot.<//Text>

< Review>
Great quality food always, even with long lines and low prices. The service was always attentive even when they were busy. Over the course of a year (since I worked nearby), I became a regular. I've had the following over multiple visits:

The wild coho salmon salad (highly recommended)
Salmon burger (awesome, especially when ordered with a wheat bun with everything on it)

Veggie burger with avocado and cheese (not bad, seems like the patty is made by MorningStar, I've had better)
Garden Wrap (Good, but falls apart and sauce will get on your hands)
Veggie omelet with fruit and bread (the cheese was great)

Sweet potato fries (good, not bad)
Regular fries

Definitely the best restaurant in that plaza! I almost always went there for lunch. They're AWESOME! They also have loyalty stamp cards - after your 10th meal, the 11th is free!< /Review>

i like their burgers here... pretty tasty and juicy and priced very well, place gets super crowded on lunch rush hour but you can place your order via fax or phone and pick it up in 10-15 minutes.< /Review>

Tasty healthy food, definitely lives up to their name.

They're really popular, so the waits are usually very long and the tiny parking lot very crowded.</Text>

<Text>Expensive and overrated for what turns out to be a thin overcooked burger with toppings that don't manage to make up for lack of flavor.

Adding avocado to everything does not necessarily make it 'good' or 'healthy' in most cases. Yet avocado seems to find it's way onto everything on the menu.

Skip it if you want a real burger or sandwich.<//Text><date>1274743849342< /date>< Pics>

I took my car to Motive 2 times for 2 different fixes. I was satisfied with the  service both times and even more satisfied with the quality of work. They had a full schedule and still found time to service my car. That says a lot for good customer service. I'll bring my car here again in the future. Great job guys!</Text>

They have fixed multiple cars my husband and I have owned over the years. They even fixed problems we didn't think could be fixed. I have had them even charge me less then they originally quoted which is un heard of. As a woman who has been scammed by so many shops in the past it means a lot to find a place that I can trust. I recommend all my friends and family to them. Way to go guys!<//Review>< name>

Absolutely the best repair shop I've ever worked with.  They don't steer you into anything you don't need, do excellent work, and always have your vehicle ready when they say they will.

We continue to bring our Toyota, Subaru, and Honda here, even though we moved out of the area a few years ago.</review>

<review>today was my second or third time visiting the shop which was recommended by my mechanic at alignment Specialties... I highly recommend the shop as they are very professional and very quick even when I come as a walk in. It's also nice to know that  I feel like I can trust the staff especially when it comes to smog which can be a little nerve-wracking when you have an older car... they make the process smooth.<//review>< Pictures>

Called various places for smog check prices, and this place had the best deal. $30 with a retest and certificate. Which is great in case it didn't pass. Called two days before and made an appointment that worked with my schedule. The waiting room is great, really clean and comforable with free water, and a playing area for kids as well.</Text>

Okay. I dont often leave reviews but this place is outstanding. Friendly staff! I got my o2 replaced and my rotors shaved in my 02 mercury villager. They cleared my check light AND fixed my squeeky door without even mentioning it or an additional fee. It was cheap and my car has never run or sounded better! It took a bit longer than expected, but to be fair I added a brake pad change too. Not to mention that I'd rather have quality opposed to speed. I'm really happy with them! Thanks Motive Car Care!<//review>

This place is beyond terrible. They were so cocky on fixing my nissan 97 and cpuldnt even find the problem. James was so rude amd very disrespectful. I was nice as i possibly can be and when i had called to ask any status on my car he quickly shun me out. They had my car for few days and had done nothing . i will not advice anyone to come here</Review>

<review>Hello Los Angeles, I left an upset review a week ago. At the time of my review I was highly upset, stressed out, emotions were running high. Understand that due to the nature of my situation, and as you may know, these situations are never easy for anyone, Not knowing what can happen, hurt and without being able to work to pay bills will make anyone uneasy. Patience is hard. Well to get to the point, after I left that message, Grupo MedLegal responded and told me where I can reach someone specifically, someone who runs the show, so he can resolve my issue. Fortunately he got to the bottom of it. It was my luck that the reason my email wasnt going through was do to a system malfunction that wasnt allowing my emails to go through to my lawyer. Thankfully due to my review they noticed this malfunction and had a tech fix it. I was able to reach my lawyer. Now im leaving this review because I felt bad for the previous review i left them. My lawyer is LIZA TORKAN(4221 Wilshire Blvd Suit 380, Los Angeles, Ca 90010) if anyone of you feel like how i felt, stressed, scared, lost. Hire this attorney. Shes highly professional. She will fight for your rights. She will fight for justice. She will have your back. Know this, in the beginning things might move slow but be patient. I wasnt. Realize that paperwork takes time to process. But be worry free because once she gets your paperwork. You are in good hands. Thank you Liza Torkan, thank you Grupo MedLegal. Justice will be served and I am safe. Sincerely, Adrian A.< /review>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) Call in anguish, Jorge Vera and Miguel from the med Legal group helped me, they were professional, very courteous and with human sympathy. They connected me with attorneys who are building my case by being hurt at work. They keep in touch, just like the lawyers call, answer calls / emails. I have faith that all of us will solve me. I don't feel alone with med legal.

(Translated by Google) bad experience, they made me believe that it was a buffet of lawyers, they are only intermediaries between the client and the lawyer, it took more than 2 years to solve my case, very dishonest lawyer, I never saw him in person, everything was by phone, I received very little compensation money for a car accident, even when I hurt my back and I was in therapy for 3 months, they charged me for all medical expenses, do not go here is the worst option, go directly to a lawyer

(Translated by Google) Medlegal assigned me to lawyers Hinden & Brelavsky, at first they treated me very well Lawyer Ian was excellent, but afterwards the assistants / secretaries are so BAD, PREPOTENT, WITHOUT RESPECT for my case, I called to ask and Secretary Maria G told me more than once, it was not the only call I was expecting, I left messages, and she never answered me and when she did she told me NOT to call her daily, after 6 months of bad service, I decided to change my lawyer and He helped me to close the case and they gave me my compensation.

<text>(Translated by Google) Excellent service in general, all the staff very attentive and above all very interested in the customer having a good experience and the best service.
In general, I would like to name the staff that has attended to my needs, but it would not be fair to do so and forget about some, I will only name Monserrat Rosas who is the last person I have spoken with, but to mention her for her excellent service , kindness and interest I do it Because that's how my experience has been with everyone at Grupo MedLegal.
I strongly recommend without thinking about it to this group, because I have had to meet people of different races, it is worth mentioning Americans, Orientals, mainly our Latino race, we are the ones who, due to ignorance of our rights, do not know how to act in different situations but who have been helped by this group.
THANK YOU MEDLEGAL AND OTHER COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR HELP.

Yo fuertemente recomiendo sin pensarlo a este grupo,porque me ha tocado connocer personas de diferentes razas, cabe mencionar americanos, orientales principalmente nuestra raza latina que somos los que por ignorancia de nuestros derechos no sabemos como actuar en diferentes situaciones pero que han sido ayudados por este grupo.

(Translated by Google) One of the worst services among lawyers.
1. In the medical area, of this law firm. In the first month, 12 therapies had to be received, of which only 3 were applied, the rest were not completed because the doctor and the rest of the staff in the clinic disappeared and were not in the clinic. On the second appointment given to me, after almost 3 weeks of reporting the incident about the previous clinic. I have my assistance in the second clinic which did not have its main doctor and even if my records had not been transferred. Even so in this clinic one of the assistants wants to provide me with a certain therapy with a kind of rounds that are placed in the of the back. She offered me and was about to put the rounds on me when I asked her not to do it because in the first place she had not asked me what my problem was and they still did not have my records ... In a few words the clinics of this group are pure invention .. Unfortunately after being already with this problem of my sciatic nerve for more than two months caused by work accident and almost 2 months working with legal group med. Nothing is solved for me yet. I am not able to work for the same physical / health condition that I maintain. And that surely they are not interested in the least solution. For this moment, I only believe that the lawyer Alex Berlin has been the one who has completed his job. For now, I am running out of money and with a son whom I do not want to fail but who is beginning to be impossible for me. Another thing to note is that if good comments are found in this area of ​​reviews, it is because at the time or after the first 3 weeks with this group. You get a call from one of their employees asking you to leave a good review for the group and for the lawyer who handles your case. So I had to put in a good review. But this is the updated of that comment and my experience with this group. Right now I am waiting for calls from the medical appointments area even if they are absent. I am still waiting for Talves with luck and God help me to see a doctor who helps me and can sign the corresponding documents to process my disability that with the first doctor was started but due to his absence it could not be specified. I have met a company and a law firm that have promised me things that after 2 months do not comply and I am already because of them about to lose part of my come to support me. I hope this comment helps you to know that although I continue with them unfortunately I have to recommend that it is a terrible company and that if you receive help it will be until your case is completed and that it is very possible it will be in a year from the beginning of your contract with them. I have already read many comments and articles from other people and it is reasonable to know that they were all real when saying that med legal group does not work. Now I hope I can maybe win my case on August 16, which is when my appointment with the judge was given. I wish you a good day.

Uno de los peores servicios entre abogados.
1. En el area medica, de esta firma de abogados. En el primer mes debi recivir 12 terapias de las cuales solo fueron aplicadas 3 el resto no se completaron porque el medico y resto de personal en la clinica desaparecieron no se encontraban en la clinica. En la segunda cita que se me da, despues de casi 3 semanas de haber reportado el incidente sobre la clinica anterior. Tengo mi asistencia en la segunda clinica la cual no tenia su medico principal y ni siquoera se habian transferido mis expedientes.. Aun asi en la presente clinica una de las asistentes me quiere proveer una terapia determinada con una especie zondas que se colocan en la parte de la espalda. Ella me ofrece y estaba a punto de ponerme las zondas cuando le pedi que no lo hiciese porque en primer lugar ella no me habia preguntado cual era mi problema y aun no tenian mis expedientes... En pocas palabras las clinicas de este grupo son puro invento.. Lastimosamente despues de estar ya con este problema de mi nervio ciatico por mas de dos meses ocacionado del acciendete laboral y ya casi 2 meses trabajando con grupo med legal. Aun no se me soluciona nada. No me encuentro en posibilidades de trabajar por la misma condicion fisica/salud que sostengo. Y que por seguro a ellos no les interesa en lo mas minimo solucionar. Para este momento creo solo el abogado alex berlin ah sido el que a cumplido con su trabajo.. Por lo pronto me encuentro sin entradas de dinero y con hijo al cual no quiero fallarle pero que se me esta comenzando a ser imposible. Otra cosa a notar es que si en esta area de reviews se encuentran comentarios buenos es por que en su momento o despues de las primeras 3 semanas con este grupo. Recives una llamada de parte de uno de sus empleados pidiendote que dejes un buen review para el grupo como para el abogado que lleva tu caso.. Entonces tube que poner un buen review. Pero este es el actualizado de ese comentario y de mi experiencia con este grupo. Ahorita me encuentro esperando por llamadas de parte del area de citas medicas aun ausentes ellos. Sigo esperando para Talves con suerte y ayuda de Dios consiga ver un medico que me ayude y me pueda firmar los documentos correspondientes para tramitar mi disbility que con el primer medico se comenzo pero por ausencia del mismo no se pudo concretar. Me eh encontrado con una empresa y firma de abogados que me an prometido cosas que despues de 2 meses no cumplen y yo me encuentro ya por culpa de ellos a punto de perder parte de mis vienes para poder sostenerme. Espero este comentario te ayude a saber que aunque yo sigo con ellos lastimosamente tengo que recomendarte que es una pesima empresa y que si recibes ayuda sera asta que tu caso se concrete y eso es muy posible sera en un año a partir del inicio de tu contrato con ellos. Eh leido ya muchos comentarios y articulos de otras personas y razonable ahora saber que todos eran reales al decir que grupo med legal no sirve. Ahora espero talves conseguir ganar mi caso el 16 de agosto que es para cuando se me dio mi cita con el juez. Te deseo un buen dia.</Text>

Bad medical attention, I suffered an accident a year ago and I hired them as my lawyers,
To date I have not received a compensation check or letters from them to keep me informed about my case. They lost my files, resent them again and lost them and in the end they asked me to take photos with my cell phone to the documents and send them as a text message.
The last time I spoke with them, they asked me to go look for evidence of the crash at the scene, it turns out that now I have to be a detective too and go to the house of the person who crashed me to take pictures of his car to see damage and send the evidence.

My car still does not receive repair or total payment for loss, thanks to this I have to pay a monthly figure of $ 80.00 per month to have it in a space.

Not recommendable

(Original)
Pesimo Servicio Juridico,
Mala atencion medica, sufri un accidente hace un año y los contrate como mis abogados,
hasta la fecha no eh recivido ni un cheque de compensacion o cartas de ellos para mantenerme informado hacerca de mi caso. Perdieron mis archivos, los reenvie los volvieron a perder y al final me pidieron que tomara fotos con mi cellular a los documentos y enviara estos como mensage de texto.
La ultima vez que hable con ellos, me pidieron que fuera a buscar evidencia del choque al lugar de lo ocurrido, resulta que ahora tengo que ser detective tambien eh ir a la casa de la persona que me choco a tomarle fotos a su carro para ver los daños y mandar la evidencia.

Mi carro sigue sin recivir reparacion o el pago total por perdida, gracias a esto tengo que pagar una cifra mensual de $80.00 al mes por tenerlo en un espacio.

VERY BAD .. NO I RECOMMEND THEM FOR NOTHING !! Super sorry to have hired you for the bad service.

The lunch buffet is awesome! All u can eat for roughly $13, such a great deal!

The butter chicken is my favorite dish here while the other dishes are just ok. The naan is nice and warm as well and it feels like they're watching until you finish it so they can bring out more for you.

There's plenty of seating which makes this place great for groups.< /text>

Used to be a lot better. We haven't eaten here since we moved more than a year ago. I think the place recently went to new management and they are still trying to figure things out. They don't fill up the trays fast enough. It took half an hour for some tandoori chicken to come out. They forgot the chutneys next to the pakoras. There were no cups with the chai. Just generally disorganized. All the food trays took a while to fill up. They even increased their prices. This used to be out favorite place with the previous owner. Just not that impressed anymore.<//review>

Very poor food. We reached 1 hour before the buffet end time then also most of the food was finished and they refused to refill it and charged us the full amount. The taste of food was also very bad< /text>

Lunch buffet was amazing.  The food here is excellent and a terrific price (weekday lunch buffet was $8.95 and included fresh na'an brought to the table and chai tea).<//Review>

The food is always on point here. The goat curries, naan, and chicken tikka masala are superb. The service is great and they remember there regulars. A must try in Sunnyvale.< /text>

<review>Taste of gobi manchurian is like gobi pokoda. Chilly chicken taste good.  Roti and chapati are same. Why extra cost?  Taste of curry is average.  the best thing is all food items I ordered were not oily at all. I am giving 3 star for non-oily food. 2 star is missing because of taste.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My favorite indian place.  That's saying a lot in Sunnyvale!  The service isn't good by traditional standards, but it's awesome in its own way.  Palak Paneer and Gobi Manchurian for the win!</Review>< user_id>

Gobi Manchurian extra spicy and mushroom mutter masala extra spicy are the best option here. Slightly expensive but with every buck.</text>

<Text>Tried egg pakora, palak paneer and mutter paneer with naan - food was decent - the mutter paneer was the best but I felt it was closer to sambar :)

Restaurant wasn't like Spick and span but was decently clean, staff were courteous.<//Text>< pictures>

Great beer selection and prices with the friendliest service makes this our go to every time- even though there are other spots closer to home ;)<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Got to know about this place from my friends and I thought will give it a try.
I have been to this restaurant more often than once a month over the past one year. One of the best Thai food in downtown and probably tops the list in the Sacramento area.
The food tastes authentic and the service is neat. spacious enough place for a team lunch. Gets really busy in the weekdays with about 20mins waiting time.
I have taken a few friends here and all of them love this place.
We always ask for food to be hot and its really spicy hot.
Must trys- Red curry, All sea food fried rice, pad thai, Thai tea.<//Text><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

I celebrated my PhD this evening in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that it was a pleasant evening and the place was clearly the reason for that fruitful evening. The crew  participated in a gorgeous style, the cuisine was delicious and my buddies were very  glad. We shall surely come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//Text>

We stopped here for lunch on our way to Lake Tahoe on a camping trip. All the items we ordered were cooked perfectly and presented well. Loved the crab fried rice, the drunken noodle and the papaya salad. We were there when they had just opened for the day and the service was quick. The name of the restaurant is what we used to hear as greetings during our visit to Thailand.<//Text>

Good Thai spot. Nice for family style dishes. Can get busy on a Saturday night. You can call and put your name on the list, which I recommend. We were there for a bday party and the staff was nice and accommodating.< /text>

Really cool little restaurant with a huge menu. I was pleasantly surprised when the waiter was able to help me navigate the menu and make certain items vegan! End ended up getting the tried and true pad thai. It was really good and a very huge portion.< /text>

The food is nice especially Phad Thai.  The waitress is generous we asked them to add more coconut milk in our red curry because it is too spicy for my friend, they did a good job for us. I appreciate with their service. Strongly recommend.< /text>

I went here for lunch with some co-workers last week (my second visit to this place). Unfortunately, three of the four of us came down with food poisoning that evening. They are also unwilling to ever split checks, and the food is on the pricy side. The good news is that the food tastes great. Still, I don't think I'll every be back. "Give me food poisoning once, shame on you. Twice, shame on me."</review>

Good place to come for Thai food. Had the chicken drunken noodle and pineapple curry and both dishes are definite recommendations. For their spice level, if you like the kick then order hot. If you like just a little bit of kick order mild. For those that just like fire in your mouth then go with the extra hot and you'll be burning.< /text>

The food was amazing. Had a big bowl of won ton soup, avocado curry, and ended it with the mango sticky rice and green tea ice cream. Not only was the food tasty, the staff was awesome and friendly as well. I couldn't have been more pleased with my visit. Definitely going back and definitely recommend.</Review>

I've come to appreciate the greatness of Sawasdee the more that I travel the world.  Every dish is filled with flavors that are hard to find anywhere.  Even the a common dish like the Pad Thai, is beyond exceptional.  The service is always perfect, and I recommend picking a curry dish if you dine here.  Portion sizes are worth the price.< /Text>

We walked in here on a whim on Saturday night. It seemed popular and was pretty busy, so we were lucky to get a table.

We had the fresh spring rolls, red curry, and pad se ew. The spring rolls were light and refreshing, and my pad se ew was some of the best I've ever had--very flavourful with tender noodles and chewy tofu.

The space was well laid out with thoughtful decor. We'd definitely come back again.< /review>

I had the Crab Pad Thai as well as let me tell you, this was THE BEST PAD THAI I have ever before had in my life!! I am not even overemphasizing. I do not even believe I have actually even come across a menu that has crab as a meat choice for pad thai. As odd as that seems, some pad thai noodles are usually still hard\/raw as well as very difficult to separate, however this was best.< /review>

The prices were amazing and the serving sizes were very generous. But the food was phenomenal!! We were a party of 10 and we all ate for under $80, and we took to-go boxes! I had the beef salad, and it was easily the best salad I've ever had. I highly recommend this awesome restaurant!!</text>

<Text>Great food and great service. I was really impressed with the pat Thai, the service was super awesome and after checkin in I received my free thai tea.

The spicy levels were in increments of 1/10 which was kinda surprising but super helpful. 3 = mild and I agreed.

Over really happy<//Text><response>None< /response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

The Drunken Noodles and Pra Ram are delicious and ridiculously affordable. I can't find another restaurant in the area that can compete with their quality and pricing.

Plus they can bring the heat. Ask for the spice tray, and try the little peppers. They've got a fire and flavor I haven't found anywhere else.<//Review>

<review>My favorite Thai place in Sacramento! It's cheap, fast and the service is great. They have specials constantly, but you are never going to pay more than $10 - $15 for a dish. In the summertime they unroll their "garage door" and the restaurant takes on more of an open air feel. It's a great date night in the summertime if you want to split a bottle of white wine with a friend and grab some salmon curry.< /review>< pics>

As most of the thai restaurant, it's a good place to share food with a group of people. Avocado green curry, crab meat pad thai are beyond expectation! We got a 130 bill with 8 people so I would say it's fairly cheap ;)<//Review>

Terrifically presented food that taste good, but is served in a very sterile environment.

The Thai Steak Sirloin was terrific, tender, and served with a wonderfully flavorful sauce. But the noodles inside the Spring rolls were extra soft, leading to an unexpected squishiness within the otherwise crispy assortment of fresh vegetables. The Salmon Curry was nice, but not spectacular.

The environment unfortunately feels like the empty shell of a former auto service garage. Sparse and with great large windows that afford a terrific view outside, but unfortunately do little to prevent outside heat or cold from easily messing with the inside environment.<//Text>

<review>Wonderful food and slow service. This place was unexpectedly busy at be 2PM and they appeared under staged for it but the food was excellent and the service was good when it happened on its own time. We had the duck curry and pad Bangkok which were both excellent choices. I'm looking forward to coming back here hopefully when not quite so busy.< /review>< pics>

This location scented so a lot like dining establishments in Thailand that it revived a flooding of memories. The fish sauce, the fermented shrimp paste, and also jasmine rice.Service was so on the round as well as they maintained examining on me every couple of minutes waiting on me to buy. Food appeared in a timely style, as well as had a great deal of leftovers so they boxed it up for me.From the Thai cold tea, to the Tom kha gai (coconut chicken soup), to the Bangkok sausages which were so complete of fresh lemongrass, as well as the Khao soi contained taste as well as had the perfect thickness as well as depth of flavor.Was too full for dessert and also loved all the meal, no complaints at all.For sure will certainly be back!< /review>

I've been here a few times now. They have dine in and carryout. It's not the best Thai food, but if you know what to get then that's satisfactory. Portions are well sized for the price. Parking may be an issue depending on the time and day because they're located on a busy corner.< /Review>

<Review>Really love this place! The interior has a cool vibe without being pretentious, and I can say the same about the staff, as well -- super helpful and friendly. We got the pumpkin shrimp curry, basil pork belly, drunken noodles and thai spring rolls. The ingredients were super fresh, everything was very flavorful and really generous portions. Can't wait to explore everything on the menu as they offer more variety than other nearby Thai restaurants<//Review>< pics>

This has become one of my goto places for Thai food.  Always good food and service.  They've also recently done an update to the inside decorations.  Waiting for weather to improve so we can eat outdoors.< /text>

<Text>This was a good Thai restaurant. I had the Panang Curry with Tofu and it was Great!!
While not the 'Best' place in Sacramento, or in Midtown, it's still pretty good; especially when compared to some of the not-so great places.
They are really accommodating for people with dietary restrictions such as Celiac Disease and they had good vegetarian and vegan options as well.
I would definitely recommend!</Text>< pics>

They brought the spring rolls out like 90 seconds after we ordered them and they were SO GOOD! My Pad See Ew took a little longer and it was DELICIOUS!

Decent food. Not much for atmosphere (former auto body shop?). Efficient Service. Had the Kao Soi (it's great they even have it), and it was good not great. Good broth, so so noodles. There's lots of good Thai nearby so this isn't a must, but decent if you end up there...</review>

Didn't really like the food, too pricey we bought 5 plates and the total came up to $50 bucks. To me that's pricey there's this other thai place that we go too and we usually order 5 plates and it doesn't even come up to $50 and the portion and taste is always a 5 star< /text>

My favorite Thai food place is relatively cheap and the food is great. The only drawback is how slow they are. You have to hunt down a waitress and be a little to insistent if you don't want to stay there forever. Don't go for lunch if you don't have at least an hour for eating< /review>

I bought a Groupon for this place and have not been able to use it because the restaurant is never open when it says it is.
First, we stopped by on a Sunday at 10:30. Closed but they had menus on the door saying that they where open 11am- 10pm Daily. OK, so we'll wait a bit and come back when they're open, no biggie.
So I dropped off my car down the street to get detailed and we'll eat while we wait for it to get done. We come back at 11:30 and guess what? Still not open. That's weird because their menu clearly says that they should be open and there is no sign to say otherwise. Odd, so I checked the website... it says they're open 11am to 10pm but they're closed on sundays. We'll that sucks, I guess we'll try again for dinner on Monday since they're open late. 9:05pm monday, here we are for the third time and NOPE not open. Not a single light on. Wtf?
Is this place ever open? Maybe I'll never find out...<//text>

My wife and I thoroughly enjoy Thai food and have tried MANY Thai restaurants all over the Sacramento area. Swasdee is the best Thai I've ever had in Sacramento.
We had the Crisp Fried Calamary for starters. I've never seen squid served in this way, but it came to us in what can best be described as "calamari chips".  If they sold this stuff in stores, I'd buy it all.  The tangy plum sauce that comes with the calamari for dipping was delicious.
For the main dish, I ordered the Pad Him-ma-parn (the stir fried Cashew plate). The flavors and spices were amazing, the meat was tender and delicious and portions on the lunch plate were perfect.
My wife had Pad Prik Gang (Pumpkin Stir Fried) with tofu. Tasty tofu can be hard to come by if it's not done properly and this was certainly done with care and love.  The flavor penetrated each part of the meal and eventually every part of the pallette.
To finish things up, we ordered the Fried Banana Ice Cream and were presented with a choice of coconut, taro, vanilla, or green tea ice cream (we opted for Coconut).  The dessert came with four adorable (and delicious) banana filled eggrolls which were drizzled with a creamy sweet sauce. the ice cream was delicious and truly wrapped up the whole experience of our meal nicely.
I'd DEFINATELY revisit and will be recommending this establishment to fans of food everywhere. When I complimented the server on a job well done, I discovered that the restaurant is family owned and ran. Our waitress thanked me, saying that they pride themselves on being able to bring the flavors of their much beloved cuisine to the people of Sacramento.  I can't wait to go back!</review>

<Review>I was excited to see this chain restaurant expanding into So Cal. I used to eat lunch at Curry Up Now in the SF bay area. If you like Indian food you will love their take on it. The Thali plates are outstanding as are the Indian burritos. If you have a sweet tooth you should try the Gulab. Yum!</Review>< Time>

I bought three meals they only gave me one small serving of chutney.  When i asked for more she said not allowed to give more even after I offered to pay.  No wonder the place is empty<//text>

<text>Food is really good but I called 7 times on Wednesday night and the girl would not pick up the phone. She was very weird about it when I asked after I got to the store.

If you are the owner, I would train your employees to pick up the phone otherwise you will loose business. We have many choices and we almost did not come because we wanted to order in advance.<//text>< pics>

Conceptually a good place, where you can grab a quick bite and continue shopping. But the food was below average at best.
Paneer pieces were huge and stale. Gravy was stale and lacked fresh flavor.< /Review>

Indian cuisine is vibrant, complex, fresh, flavorful, satisfying.  The meal I tried here was none of those things.

<Review>So far the best indian taste with decent pricings around. I tried their moong daal halwa aka lentil dessert, kachori chaat, vada paav, paneer sabji and parathas. They were all very well made and delicious. I thought it would be plain paratha as they mention in menu but that was stuffed aalu paratha.  I wish the paneer was soft in paneer sabji but the gravy was tasty.The service is fast . I would definitely recommend this place.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Firstly, the location on the map is wrong. It does not show to this location. I am new to the area and it was super difficult to find it.
Secondly, the app is not updated with menu on ground. I ordered chai and they told me it’s not available. No hot beverages at all. It’s cold out here and should we drink only cold drinks?
Thirdly, the bournvita milk was cold. Who has it cold? The staff did not even heat it up. Disappointed</text>

<text>The Hella Vegan Burrito was Hella great! The perfect amount of spicy, savory and sweet and was very filling. As a runner I'm always hungry and  the burrito kept me full for hours. I appreciated the fusion style and new twists on classic dishes. *bonus* As a Vegan the restaurant knew exactly what was in each dish without hesitation, very reassuring.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Attention everyone ! This is not how indian food tastes like. This is just some frozen, preserved and processed food. I would never come back. If I could give negative stars I would have given. The attender ate extra 6 dollars while billing us. It is not yet refunded. Very bad for children. Please don't promote and support this restaurant. Prices are unreasonable too.< /review>

Mainly chicken and lamb and also vegan options. We ordered chicken masala bowl, tiki masala burrito and kids chicken and rice plate. Everything was awesome and our service was impeccable. My daughter got a complementary milk and cookies. Their drink option is organic sodas and bottled Coke or Sprite.

< review>
A very unpleasant first visit. I requested all my food to be vegan, as there are options on the menu. I ordered $35 worth of food to find out that they had cheese and meat. The "Sexy Fries" has a vegan option without cheese, but it came with paneer, even though the box had a "vegan" label. The vegan bowl "Peace, Love, Vegan" had meat in it. How big of a mistake you have to make to get them wrong? When getting the food, I even ensured with the cashier if all the food were vegan. He confidently ensured me that they were indeed vegan. For those who have dietary restrictions, please, open the boxes and literally check all your food before leaving the restaurant. As for me, I will never ever come back here again.<//review>

<review>A different take on the traditional food. The menu, food and ambiance was interesting. Food is not bad either. Being in spectrum it is an option for an evening food joint.</review>< Pics>

<text>Loved the Hella Vegan Samosa Burrito—large enough to feed two people, great flavor. The mint-ginger lemonade was delightful. Friendly and attentive staff. Looking forward to returning next time we’re in town.  (Please open a location in the southeast US!!)< /text><Name>Rebecca Weston</Name>< gmap_id>

My first experience with Indian cuisine and it was wonderful.  The food was great and the customer service was good as well. Don't be fooled by the negative reviews, please give them a try!</Text>

I had the chicken tikka masala burrito. The flavor of the rice was gritting in the way of the chicken tikka masala. I think it would taste better with plain basmati rice and more sauce. Overall, I guess it works as a fusion, though I don't know why you would ever trade out a good naan bread for a tortilla. I think a naan taco would be much better. Sometimes it's better to leave things the way they are.</review>

First time there was only two small pieces of chicken, second time very small portion of lamb keema was only at the bottom of the burrito. Distribute the meat evenly throughout the burrito!!! Compared to the Curry Up Now location in Bay Area, this one is ok, could be better. 1) Serve enough meat in orders, 2) Improve the taste a little, it’s just not the same quality tasty Curry Up as the Bay Area.< /Text>< date>

Loved the food! Naughty Naan is the best!! Tea came with cute indian cookies.. reminded me of childhood.  Busy but service is quick and staff is friendly!
Best is you can eat while watching older kids play outside in play ground.
We ll be back.. Definitely</text>

<Text>I never write bad reviews but I am frustrated after visiting this restaurant. Do not go here expecting good Indian Street Food, you will be disappointed. First we ordered a kachori chat item. It was few pieces of kachori (that you get from store) crushed and served with touch of yogurt, chutneys and chana. Completely overpriced. Next, we thought of giving it a second chance and ordered a bowl of ghee Makhni butter (Paneer). A few bites and it reminds of a familiar taste. The Paneer was so rubbery we doubt it was even fresh. I hope they do not serve ready to eat food from the store. Overall a disappointing experience regards to food. Table next to us had got wrong order. There was lot of expectation, but it was disappointment and it's little overpriced compared to other Indian restaurants. Ambience is good but you don't want to see the word "Hernia" on the wall when you expect to enjoy your food. Hope you guys improve!</Text><user_name>Aditya Ekawade</user_name>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><text>This is an interesting take on Indian street food. It’s mostly Punjabi inspired dishes and some Indian favorites as well. The establishment is a bit snug with some outside seating as well. The service is quick. This was my second time visiting the restaurant. I had ordered the Meat Sweats thali dish, the samosas, and one of the lite thali dishes called Soup and Roll. For drinks I recommend a chai tea, which comes with sugar packs on the side and two vanilla cookies. The food is high quality, fresh and very delicious. The curries are indeed spicy in a delicious, tolerable and balanced way. Everything is very balanced in flavors and textures/consistency. Also, the plating is simple and neat. I highly recommend one of the thali dishes and the samosas.</text>< pictures>

<text>After being to the northern California restaurant, was excited to have a local one. Almost an hour for some paneer fries, no communication between the front and kitchen. Food is pretty good, but items come spaced out 10-15 minutes.<//text>< pics>

Totally a let down.

I need to throw the entire order away. I cannot trust the authenticity of this food.

I am not coming here anymore.

They say deconstructed samosa as their best dish , i would say worst. No flavor,no taste
Ordered tikka masala with rice but the quantity of rice was so small.
Order a side of rice which took 10 mins to come to plate.
The person eating next to me got hair in his burrito.
Expensive, not worth even a try.</Review>

Love Love the Paneer Tikka Masala Food.
Alex was so helpful helping me choose as I don't know a lot about Indian food other then I like it. Their Burittos are big, delicious & full of flavor.
I met the Manager, his name is Ali. He and Alex made me feel comfortable & welcome.  I will be coming here often as there are so many food choices to try and I work in the Spectrum. I will be telling my coworkers & friends.< /Review>

Our family’s second time back, same consistent taste and service with a smile. Traditional Indian menu options presented with a twist is a deIight for the taste-buds. I had been to Curry Up Now in the Bay Area, and this location gets 5 stars as it checked all the boxes in my list . Out of many options, we tried kathi roll, chaar-papri, naughty naan, thaali and deconstructed samosa. Everything was delicious.👌👌Will be back again for sure</Text>

<text>Indian street food with a contemporary twist is a welcome change from the ordinary. We tried sexy fries, kachori-chaat & paneer burritos on our first visit here about 2 weeks ago. This time we tried kathi roll, naughty naan, thaali & deconstructed samosas. The place was busy & but we didn’t wait long for the fresh hot food. Definitely will be back for more!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Sandeep Jawanda< /username><response>None</response></record>

Close to my house. The employee at the deli made us a couple of sandwiches.

The bad...
Safeway is too expensive and the lines to long. Also there no WiFi signal anywhere is the shopping center.<//Review>< Name>

A great store for everything you need. They have an excellent deli case with both hot and cold food, great selection of fresh produce and breads from their bakery. You use a Safeway rewards card when making a purchase to save money on future gas purchases.< /review>

I cant seem to get out of Safeway for under $60 if I'm buying stuff for dinner but they've always been a really good place to get a quality lunch on a budget. If I need help finding something, there always seems to be an employee nearby who's actually willing to help. Been going to Safeways all my life lol</Text>

This is a yelp about a Safeway customer service employee Discriminated against my age my color and my working status, cheating me out of 20 dollars while cashing a emergency paper payroll check. I remember shopping at Safeway in that same parking lot as a young child with my mom iy was where rite aide is today, My family has spent countless paychecks buying groceries enjoying the weekly savings recently the just 4 u deals. I liked Safeway it was my Go to grocery store for most of my 67 years of life. Recently in the mangrove Chico store on Halloween about 2;30 in the afternoon. I am a essential worker, employed as a care giver, with adding my new client I was paid with a paper payroll check. The bank was closed and my account had been hacked so my card was locked. I was happy to receive the P check  to purchase Halloween treats and get groceries. When I went to Customer service a employee by the name of Noah Rodgerize. charged me 25 dollars to cash my check? When I went to question him he walked away from me, refused to write down his name, he even told another cashier to call security on me the cashier asked him what was wrong he put his hands in the air and said I just charged her 25  dollars to cash a check like everyone else. I wrote the mans name. I told the cashier I had his name, he told me to call the # on the receipt. I left the store no goodies no treats upset on a  payday holiday. When I returned to the store with the receipt that actually shows he charged me 4'50 cents to cash the check And just took the 20 dollars.. I told the manager what happened he replied for me to file a police report , if I wanted to file a complaint so they could look at the tape. I had the receipt if he doubted me why did he not say he would view the transaction and get back to me. Instead he continued to defend Noah R. although he said he was no longer employed there, even more reason to hear my complaint. I feel I was racial discriminated against and I intend to return to call the police so we can view the transaction. Which clearly will show  240 dollar check he laid 2 one hundred dollar bills a 10 and a crumpled torn up 5 dollar bill and change on the counter with the receipt.  I said my check was 240, the story he told was it cast 25 dollars to cash a check . I was astonished mad wanted to get on with my day, I started to leave the store said no I have to talk to someone about this so I went back just to get his name , he made a lot of drama and I lost my money to a Safeway employee in customer service, blatantly did it he hollered about in the store no one asked what was wrong???.I am angry with my neighborhood Mangrove ave Safeway Store. I am real serious.<//Review>

The problem is the mask policy. They require a mask, which is good, but sitting in the parking lot watching people, about 10 percent had the mask pulled down, so that their nose was exposed, defeating the purpose of the mask, and No one was correcting them (profits before safety? ).  Even the kid who collects shopping carts was doing that.  Why bother with the mask if it doesn't cover your nose?
Speaking of shopping carts,  you have to wipe your own cart down. Safeway hasn't invested in a spray bottle of bleach and a rag for the cart collector to sanitize the carts, like other stores. This is disconcerting of you are taking the virus seriously......<//text>< rate>

<review>Best store in Burney. They will always have power and the team that works here is one the Union should definitely be proud of. Everyone is outgoing, great spirited and polite. The store is always in great shape and well stocked. I've never had a bad time here. Definitely the best Safeway I've been to.< /review>< UserId.>

Very Clean, fully stocked organized store with a friendly efficient staff. They have a bakery that bakes fresh items everyday. A fully stocked meat department, a fresh deli with a menu that has a large variety of delicious made to order or already made sandwiches, hot meals, or a bowl of the soup of the day. They have a floral department that has fresh flowers for all occasions including holidays. Wine, cheese & greeting cards, plus other last minute "must haves" for a dinner party, whether you're going to the party or throwing it. Love this store!</Text>

Decent store at a good location but very expensive, even with a membership for savings. Good to stop in for a few essentials but do your general food shopping elsewhere. I recommend WinCo.< /review>

It feels a bit claustrophobic inducing; the aisles are already rather close together but whomever is in charge of displays has crammed a plethora of them in making it impossible to pass other shoppers who may be paying no mind. The selection is great and the employees friendly.<//Review>

Every store has unpleasant employees that you learn to avoid and awesome employees that put a smile on your face when you walk in and see them working. I absolutely love my neighborhood Safeway. If you're ever in there and find yourself needing any assistance, look for one of these shiny, smiley people, Andrew, Cindy & Grover. Hope I spelt their names right. 😊 They are just awesome employees, that I truly appreciate. They're great at their job, all stand with great posture & look you in the eyes & actually listen (the whole time). 😁 No matter the issue, you'll walk away smiling 😆 promise!< /Text>

I guess if you go there often you'll learn were in everything but for a casual visit is hard to drive through. The produce is fresh an good overall is a good store. But the prices are hi, a product that in WinCo cost 5 in Safeway is 7. I mean the same brand and everything! 40% more is not worthy.<//review>< Rating>

I live on the other side of this Safeway, but it's worth the drive!! Love the O and Signature brands and come in every Friday for $5.00 day. They have the best donuts and fried, baked and Sriracha chicken in tow. The wine dept has all my favorites.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Once they address the issues with panhandling and loitering, this will be a terrific store. The prices aren't terrific, but they're not completely horrifying either. Good selection of most everything. Nice bakery, except for the roaches. They might want to address that, as I advised the manager, who blew me off. See the picture? Anyway that's the big one that made me quit going there.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf0aXkqdieB6VD_Ow8jrSQDw6uD_74UKKm82LC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>I am a disabled woman and I am shocked with how I was treated with the utmost disrespect today. My cashier was Pete and he made me have to bag my own product when I am obviously disabled and am unable to do so because of my back condition (I can hardly walk). He saw me and did not attempt to help me although I asked for help. After this experience I was followed out by Safeway security for no apparent reason. When I returned at a later time because I could not believe what had happened I asked for a manager (Gabriel) who just shrugged it off, asked for my caregivers name and cell number (as he did not even acknowledge me) and then told him he would call "us" back. Not only am I invisible as a disabled customer but as a woman as well? I also called back later in the day and he said he was busy and again did not acknowledge my experience, shock or anxiety over the situation. Nor did he ever return the call. My caregiver also doesn't appreciate Safeway holding onto his personal info. Especially when Gabriel did not inform him as to why, when I am the party involved here. I don't know why Safeway still hires misogynists and bigots? I thought times had changed...< /text><user_id>106602982433536791127<//user_id></record>

Safe way is great. A bit expensive in comparison to some other grocery stores, but great quality and convenience. Plus they do carry a larger variety of specialty foods that are hard to find  or that other grocers might not carry. Usually extremely organized and well maintained.</review>

I love their signature brand coffee and the staff is always very nice. Safeway is expensive,  and they play with prices. I do not like the fact that you have to have a club card to get a sale item at the sale price. No other stores make you do this.
The sales they offer sometimes are not sales at all. Example: soda is 3.99, they will put it on sale, but you have to buy 3 to get one for free. So they jack the price up 1.00. So now its buy 3 at 4.99 and get one for free. Regular price 3.99 X 4 = $15.96. Sale price 4.99 X 3 = $14.97. And you get one for free. Yes you saved a whole quarter per 6 pack of soda. But you HAVE to buy 4. Is spending almost $20 of your grocery budget really worth .25 cents in savings. Not for me.</text>

The Manager of the store, Cal I think is a very very poor manager. I had an issue and all he wanted to do was bribe me with a gift card and told me not to call corporate. Absolutely doesnt care about this store or its customers it's pretty sad. Will never come back because of this Cal guy who says he is the Store manager what a joke.< /review>

Overall my experience is pretty much always a good one here at Safeway on Mangrove. Didn't get to use the self checkout but it was 2am. Staff is always friendly and am offered assistance all throughout the store. Self checkout is any amazing time saver, I just wish it was 24 hours as well.< /Text>

<Review>I had 30 minutes for lunch, thought I'd get something from the deli. Took all 30 minutes for a small tub of chicken, only because no one wanted to work in that department.  Lots of people walking through but no one to help. Far to busy. Now I'm hangry. Thanks a lot safeway very disappointed.

Safeway is a good store to get what you need they have a wide variety of choices to pick from and they have many different kinds  of choices to choose from like the almond milk we get they have like 4 different kinds and that's awesome because the little one only drinks that kinds of milk<//review>

Safeway has an excellent reputation...and my family has shopped there for ages.  You really can't beat the friendly service at the Safeway on East Ave!!  I choose to shop at that particular Safeway because I've had so many personable experiences with the staff.  I want to tell them they have a thumbs up from me!!! And I appreciate thier quality of service.<//review>

We shop here all the time and there are hardly ever any baggers to help you bag at check out. We spoke with the manager and pointed out all the customers bagging there own foods and the manager shrugged it off. Why come here and pay the higher prices and not get the service<//Text>

Safeway is a full service grocery store. Safeway has a long-standing good reputation for Quality Foods and good value. The Safeway on Mangrove in Chico, has a full service butcher and also has a deli and a place to buy prepay prepared foods. Safeway has a big produce department with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.</review>

In this case though I visited it to purchase Dry Ice which to my knowledge is not available at other stores in the area. It is rather pricey, but if you need it it's there.< /text>< Pics>

<username>Ryan DeMont<//username><Text>It's not "this" Safeway, it's just that "all" Safeways are overpriced. So with a 1 star rating preceding any evaluation of this particular Safeway's merits, it's made quite a comeback, this Safeway. I mean, 3 stars after an wearing a 1 star rating due to it's costly reputation. Pretty good. It got the bump due to it's proximity to my house and penchant for being open late enough for me to pick something up after work. I mean, it's not easy to be a place in this town that's open after 10pm on weeknight unless you're a bar. So kudos, "This" Safeway. Your hours of operation are something to be really proud of. Keep shooting for the stars. But really, I mean, nice comeback. 3 Stars.< /Text>< rating>

<Review>Been going here for over 25 years, great staff and the store is always clean. Slight slipping hazard outside the store when it rains. This is due to the white markings painted on the street that get slick when wet. Other than that this place has been good to me. I get a soup and sandwich at least once a week and they have great deals and make a mean sandwich.</Review><Rate>4</Rate>< GmapID>

There isn't another place in the county I can get number #1 grade fresh ahi tuna for sushi, or wild shrimp, and their choice beef specials are worth it. The rest of the store is a zero, they don't even stock decent sushi rice, lol. Clueless!< /Text>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I love this Safeway. The store is always quite clean and organized and the staff is always available to help if needed. I can always find exactly what I need when I get a there and there is never a huge wait even when it is during a busy time of day. The deli department is awesome with a sushi chef on hand through the day to make sushi to order or you can pick something out of the display. I live coming here to shop, if you have the time you can also grab a coffee from the in-store Starbucks. Great place to get your grocerites or just grab a cup of joe and hang out with friends.  Five stars for sure!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

They have a lot of pre made veggie meals and meat on skewers for a great price. Eggs are by the beer and wine, not the typical spot on the outer edges of the store. Clean and presentation was good.</text>

<Text>Approached a cashier that teller was close, to ask him something , and his automatic response was, sorry I'm close instead of asking if I needed help with anything. I replied, can I just ask you one thing? He said oh yes, sorry, go ahead. Then, when I was paying at the self- check- out, my rewards didn't process and the cashier refunded me for the two items that I caught, then he tells the cashier that I first approached that I didn't know how to count. When I got home I realized that I had missed one of the items. I didn't go back because it was late and because I would have felt uncomfortable due to my first in counter.< /Text></record>

Well they were stocking the shelves but not with their own employees but with outside people so a little all over the place and then had employees seeming to follow me because I took too long to pick out my items while looking for the best price!  How rood! Next time I will give them my list and they can get the items to me at check out!<//Text>

<Text>Because I spend money no different than any other customer in safeway. I should not be treated or looked down on. My life partner of years and I DON'T steal any where we go. So why follow me everytime I shop or at least one employee looks at me like I'm below them. Even there knew security dude told my man to pull up his pants the other day. I think the colored people call this sagging. What's it to him any way. Unless he was just checking out my man but.Heck his pants were to brigand had slipped down a bit. Just because they think we are out here living not because we chose to, but because we were done living with rats rodents .slum lord won in court, only in Chico. So were being treated as such in store we treat with respect. UN like Chico doesn't. Treat us with a little respect and dignity.<//Text>< resp>

<Review>Been shopping here for years and it's likely the most accessible and cleanest Safeway on the West side of town.

The produce is great and the staff here are very friendly. Other than that, it's your standard Safeway.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< user_id>

<text>Was better before the buyout but still one of the best stores in town, use the app to add coupons before shopping and you can do just as well or better than wiinco but nicer store. They have been doing much better with moving the panhandling out but they still hang out and can get very aggressive.< /text>< pictures>

Favorite location in chico, they always have great organic options and they even have a small bulk food section of dry goods too. Usually has pretty good deals on the stuff you need and also for the midnight snacks.<//Text>

They are the only ones who carry the bread I like, and large curd cottage cheese. Great people and selection. The deli makes the best breakfast burritos. Yummy.<//Review>

We use to come here all the time for breakfast burritos until after today. We waited 5-10 minutes so we can have potato wedges (nothing special!) and got tater tots instead! We call the manager and she was very rude and wasn't even sympathetic. If I'm going to spend 4-5 dollars on something it should be the right way! And to be treated poorly? Unacceptable! Not going to this place again.<//Review>

Safeway is a great place to stop by for a guick bite or to grab what you need to prepare a gourmet meal. The clerks are always helpful and the prices are fair. Suprisingly they have fresh made sushi that is very nice. Also, a great selection of cheese. Grab some gourmet crackers and a bottle of wine and you have a great start to a cozy evening. What ever your situation you will find just the right ingredients at Safeway.<//Review>

My favorite Safeway in town. Always surprisingly clean considering all of the transients that go through trashing it. I have tons of respect for these employees and how they handle some of the people who give them a hard time there. Dave the wine man is the best and will always give you amazing recommendations! Overnight crew can be unpleasant and hard to find at times. Clean public bathrooms!<//Review>

<review>Yes, it's a bit higher in price than some stores, but the personalized customer service far exceeds what you will experience elsewhere. They will always do whatever they can to make a happy customer, going above and beyond time and time again.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>4 stars solely because after a specific time of day, (9:00PM maybe?) they bar one set of doors for the entire half of the store. This is seriously irritating, considering many handicapped parking spots are on the opposite side of the store, and these people also move through the doors extremely slowly, creating a bottleneck in the flow of traffic and resulting in lines of angry shoppers piling up behind them, and possibly even creating a small fire hazard. We all know that they do it to prevent theft, but they already have cameras right at the exits staring you in the face as you leave, as well as a security guard, so please just let the rest of us, the huge majority that are law abiding citizens, utilize the doors that you have RIGHT THERE, it's likely to attract enough returning customers to more than make up for the occasional shoplifter. I really doubt that by shutting one set of doors, any potential thief has said "Whoa, too much work for me to walk to the other side of the store with this stolen bottle of vodka, I'll just pay for it after all." I can't see a situation that blocking one pair of doors is going to stop someone from proceeding with their plan to steal.< /review><time>1448567167587< /time>< rating>

My favorite grocery store in Chico! The store is huge, as a great selection, employees are always friendly and helpful. I'd much rather drive the distance to the Mangrove store than the other Safeway on Walnut.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I try to avoid this specific Safeway.  It seems as though the Safeway Corp couldn't give a dang.  Always a long wait in line.  I went here specifically to get cash back with my purchase.  The cashier could only give  $20 and I needed more than this.  I would've used the self check and got cash back, however after 8 am and no self checkstands were open yet.  I'll stay clear of this one from now on. Workers are very nice however.</Review><date>1486570512333<//date><Name>Selina McD</Name><gmap_id>0x808327bf5e9a656d:0xf9bc77bdedb2ff89< /gmap_id><user>100078004035881315649<//user><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

They're awfully expensive and quite frankly their products or not that good low quality meat unless you pay a higher end fish has an order the produce only last a couple of days when you bring it home and I could go on but I think this is enough</Text>

< Review>
This safeway location shines head and shoulders above the rest. It can be busy and crowded but thats probably because its popular for shoppers. The produce department gets lots of attention unlike some stores. Fresh quality food and competative to awsome on pricing. Friendly, courteous and helpful staff. One of My choice grocery stores in Chico.< /Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Once again got frustrated by Safeway's poor customer service. They often have too few people on duty and the line gets way to long to check out. I went to Safeway to get 4 items and was short of time. When I got to checkout the line so long I had to just leave my cart and head out. Only one checkout open.<//review><user>104797709902226181745</user></record>

Store is nuthn special. Their meat dept is a JOKE. They closed at 7p and I asked for a special cut at 530 and I was denied not once, but TWICE! Y u ask? Bcuz they were n the middle of cleaning up yet they told me NO after they still had another 90+ mins b4 they closed. Bunch of Block Buster Rhymes if u ask me!< /Text>

Looks like a grocery store and quacks like a grocery store, but I'm not about labels so I'm not going to call it anything. Please see store for details about how they may or may not operate.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Very poor service, had an assistant manager say I couldn't buy 2 gift cards because the system tracked what I bought. Asked to speak to the manager, they said they didn't know and gave me a number to call. The number was the internal number for Safeway to report employee accidents. Needless to say I won't be returning.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>
