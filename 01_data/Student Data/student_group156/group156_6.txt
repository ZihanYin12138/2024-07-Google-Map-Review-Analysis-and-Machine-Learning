Highly recommend. Both staff were super welcoming and very friendly. Took the time to explain all of the great things on the menu. Ordered a Vanilla Bean iced latte with almond milk, it was perfectly lightly sweet and tasted wholesome. Tons of good quality coffee options. Excited to come back and try more.< /text>

Coffee Cycle is absolutely the best coffee spot in SD.  Chris and the gang were super friendly and helpful with navigating the menu.  Aren’t Chris’ the best?! Great location on Grand - not too deep in the belly of PB that you’ll struggle with traffic or parking.  We’re going back tomorrow morning!< /review>

<Text>Start by saying that the espresso is top notch. I've been to hundreds of specialist coffee shops all over the US and Europe. Coffee Cycle holds their own against some stuff competition.

Also...bacon burrito. Just sayin'.

Nice way to start the day<//Text><user_id>104305241457881363141</user_id>< rating>

Chris and his team are the best! He will instantly make you feel so welcome, like you're old friends. He's incredibly knowledgeable and can walk you through the coffee menu to find the perfect drink for you. The coffee's a bit on the expensive side but trust me, it's worth it. Delicious every time.< /Text>

Also the environment is different..Never had a coffee place feels more than just a coffee shop..this place make you feel like sitting down and talking to a friend while having a cup of coffee.
Also you can feel owners passion about making a really nice coffee shop with very good quality of coffee. You can just feel that in the atmosphere. Weird cute little shop.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>If you are a coffee purist or love single source handcrafted elixirs of joy made by people who know their beans then this is the place! Super friendly, cute gem of a place that takes extra care in making coffee for discriminating palates and simple old caffeine craves! A PB must. Pup friendly!</Review>< pics>

<rate>5</rate><review>Man, this place is awesome. I was in town for the weekend (drinking a lot of coffee) and this was by far the best place I went. Chris is a true coffee guru and his passion for coffee and customer service makes the whole experience wonderful. The Costa Rica drip coffee was amazing, even better after learning they get their coffee beans direct from a partnership they have with a coffee farm in Costa Rica. I am bummed I don’t have one of these in Arizona, but I will definitely be stopping here again the next time I’m in San Diego. Thanks again!<//review>< pictures>

The coffee is delicious and interesting. The burritos are tasty too, but above all the best part of my experience was the staff. Genuinely friendly, intimately knowledgeable of the products, considerate, accommodating, and, despite extremely limited seating, are not particularly concerned with turning over customers. If you’re looking for a perk, the coffee will get the job done, but the service will put it over the edge. Really well-done, guys.<//review>

Good sense of humor too.  They make their own cashew milk!! Was nice enough to give me a sample before ordering.  Latte was very yummy.  Would highly recommend!< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is the best. The coffee is world class quality and the employees are as good as you can ask for. The owner is an absolute beautiful soul and an absolute coffee nutso. He’s also pretty into biking which you may be able to tell when you walk in. Highly recommend this for any coffee needs. Amazing house made milks that change with the season. Thank you Coffee Cycle!<//review>

Such a great local place. They make their own white chocolate sauce and their own cashew milk. The coffee is quite delicious as well! The owner is incredible friendly. I visited while on vacation, but if I lived here I would be a regular!! Thank you for the amazing coffee!!</review>

<Response>{'time': 1589583849212, 'text': "Mishel!  I'm so sorry you feel that way about our mask and Covid response.  We've taken great pains since the beginning to ensure our customers' safety.  Our baristas have been wearing masks for weeks longer than has been required, and we try to sanitize all surfaces in the store between customers.  In case we don't sanitize between customers, we have timed sanitizing every hour to make sure there are no contaminated surfaces.  We don't require customers to wear masks- the city does.  We are very appreciative of the customers that Do wear masks, and we'd like it if every customer did.  Generally, we've felt the Vast majority of our customers Do wear masks and are great about waiting outside and keeping good social distance.\nAs a general rule, we don't enforce the city's mask requirement as that enforcement very easily violates important medical privacy laws.  Some people cannot wear a mask for very valid medical reasons, and it is unethical and illegal to require them to divulge anything about their medical history.  Especially when non-masked folk are in our store, we rigorously sanitize afterward.\nAs far as organic milk:  we've always used organic milk at Coffee Cycle until the current pandemic made our supply chain more difficult.  We still try to use organic milk when we can get it, but unfortunately that is not always the case right now.\nAs a final note, it is disappointing to see one of our Coffee Cycle family reach out with this feedback through this forum.  We love getting feedback, and hearing that we disappointed you will always motivate us to try and be better.  After coming here so long, we wish you had felt comfortable voicing your concerns to us personally.  In that we've somehow created the scenario where you felt this was your best course of action, we've failed you deeply.  Our community is precious to us: every voice should be heard.  You can always talk to us.\nStay safe and happy, and maybe one day we'll get to help you again.  Until then, we'll miss you!"}< /Response><userid>116984165310863733314<//userid>< date>

<gmapID>0x80deaaec7b313d83:0x585684db8da9318</gmapID><Review>I have gone to Coffee Cycle for years, their baristas are always so friendly and I love the variety of beans they use. Recently due to the pandemic I have felt extremely uncomfortable as they don't enforce the mask requirement and most customers not only don't wear them but hang out inside the shop chatting with them (and spreading their germs). Most other coffee shops I have been to don't allow customers inside their store, especially small ones and all of them have signd requiring the use of masks.

I'm sure they're not saying anything so as not to offend any customers, but this is for public health reasons.

Also, it would be great to see organic milk.</Review></record></dataset><record>

If you want to support local businesses in San Diego that are doing excellent work, this is the kind of place you want to source from. I get whole beans to take home and the single-origin selection is typically varied and always high quality. In-house pour-overs are always made with the right water to bean ratio, the grind is spot-on, and they are so good. Any beans he has in-stock are available as espresso.</text>

Not only is this a cool concept, but the coffee is consistently a high quality product which is pretty incredible considering it is all made on a bicycle on the side of the road. Coffee Cycle is moving into a permanent space in Pacific Beach so I'm anticipating more of the same if not better. Plus the best service. Thanks for being awesome Coffee Cycle!</text>

<review>Coffee for the people. It's not enough to say that Coffee Cycle produces the best cup of coffee, even though it is. But CC is so much more. It attracts great people and is such a relaxed and fun atmosphere, that it's easy to spend an hour here without noticing. Thank you Chris for creatinf such an incredible space.</review></record></dataset><record>

Best coffee I've had in a while. Since last time I was here. Get the Sumatra latte, one shot and strong(less milk) - it will blow your mind, that a coffee can have so many flavour notes.<//Review>

<Text>Amazing coffee. Cycles. Crawling plants. Light island jams. Great staff. Pastries.

What more do you want? This is legit coffee made as it should be. If you love a proper coffee definitely check this out.

This cup of "joe" is balanced...... like you should be on a cycle.<//Text>< UserId.>

Probably the only pretentious coffee place I'll go to. The owners cool guy, they do pour overs, and he makes his own syrups that are light on the sugar but high on the flavor.

You can bring your dog, and the coffee is reasonably priced. The owners of bicyclist so there's a lot bicyclist around usually.

There multiple types of coffee and a lot better rated by the equivalent of wine connoisseur for coffee.

Ask him about the coffees. He'll tell you which one has a flavor you're looking for it.< /review>

this is a coffee lovers local coffee shop! the top shelf roasts, attention to detail, friendly guests and caring owner/barista, Chris, are a warm reprieve from chain shops! I’m glad to have my new local spot. And I feel a weekend meet up/bike ride hub in the making!

Coffee Cycle is bar far one of my top cafe experiences ever! The owner, Chris, is super friendly, knowledgeable about coffee, and knows how to make a stellar espresso/coffee! Chris's menu is original and every syrup/spice blend is made in house with local ingredients. I wish there was a replica of coffee cycle near me.<//text>

So next time I’m in the area I’ll actually go and get a cup of joe and leave an actual review.

This site is my first choice site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to that place. everytime  I feel like having a delicious supper, this place comes first to my head. extremely good and diverse  food and a rich menu.great staff, and nice atmosphere. And very important, the cost is reasonable. I praise this restaurant with pleasure.< /review>

Amazing Taco place. Only eating outside or to go. Well worth it to come by and have some authentic Mexican. They also take credit cards and Grub Hub delivers.< /review>

<text>Best nachos around bar none. Chicken tacos are also pretty good. The chips are fresh and made in house. They melt cheese over it so not the traditional yellow cheese but still very good<//text>< date>

The best hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in So Cal. I love the sisters who work here! So cute and nice. The food is almost as good. The conchinita pibil, or pork, is very addictive, juicy and spicy. Tacos were fresh and yummy. Tortas were smaller than what I'm used to, but delicious. Burritos were filled refried beans. Aguas fresca de pina, or pineapple, drink was good. I can't wait to go back for more.<//review>

First time visiting this Yuca’s... I think they close around 8pm. I had gone to the original location many years ago.

I was determined to try the signature family recipe cochinita pibil burrito. The staff was cool and let us try a small sample of that pork and also of the machaca.

My bro and I both thought the flavor in the machaca (juicy, tasty, sinewy shredded beef w tons of flavor) was good. Staff said his favorites were the machaca and the carne asada.

We got one of each burrito, split in two, some tortilla chips and guac. And I must say, their red sauce to me, frikking delicious.

Def going back here often!< /Text>

Yuca’s is the best go to quick Mexican lunch place in Pasadena! Their burritos are killer and I love the salsas — both the red and green salsas are amazing. My favorite order is the veggie burrito 🌯 — it’s well priced and so tasty.

I also like their French fries as a side. They are super crispy!

At the lunch hour, there can often times be a line cause of the local hospitals and colleges in the area taking their lunch break. I recommend calling in advance and then picking it up — makes it even quicker.

Yuca’s is also a Pasadena staple! Got to love a family run business! ♥️</Text>

<review>I've been eating Yucas since the early 70s and the food is top notch, as it's always been. Now that they're in Pasadena just makes it that much better for me, as I'm only 10 miles from them. I recommend them to anyone looking for great tasting food<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>It was pretty bad.. I got a completely unremarkable hot dog that tased like a sausage.. and and the asade burrito that was full with a scarce amount of crumbly dry meat and a bunch of big dry pinto beans that actually dry your mouth as you eat it. Plus the burrito is Expensive ... You pay extra for rice.... Salsa.... Guac... Anything that could of possibly made it good. All these reviews are BS. Listen to Me! Lol. I'm from the valley, so maybe I'm spoiled in the Mexican food department.. but I don't know what this was supposed to be. The service was friendly though.
I do think the American menu was fairly cheap.. but I don't know the size of everything to be sure.</Text>< Date>

This was my 1st time here....and let me tell you, I had the carne asada tacos and chicken burrito. The carne is so good, but then the tortilla on the burrito taste like it was home made. Can't ever go wrong with that! 😍<//Text>

Just found this place. Great food! The meat is amazing and really took our meals to the next level (we got a shredded chicken burrito and carne asada nachos). Will definitely be coming here again.< /text>

<Review>1st. Time here on 10.05.17.
Tried the 'Cochinita Pibil' tacos = excellently cooked, very tender pork meat with their own mix of seasoning! It was to lick your fingers of how delicious this is. Good prices, client service very amicable. The only thng's limited seating outdoors. Still I'll be going back for sure 👍👍👍</Review></record></dataset><record>

Not bad, but not amazing like I've been led to believe either. It's a little bit hard to find since it's this little side section outside of a liquor store with seating on the side facing away from the main road. It also bears the signage of the previous store which may confuse people, but they put out a smaller sign facing the road announcing their presence. I plan to give it another chance someday.< /Text>

<text>Junk King was the single bright light in my Moving Week From Hell. Called on Tuesday morning and talked to a friendly representative, who arranged for junk removal the following morning. It took less them all of an hour and a half to fill up two huge truckloads and ferry them away. Friendly, quick, reasonably priced, and left nothing behind.

Hope I don’t have to use their services for a while, but Junk King will definitely be my first call.</text>< Pictures>

<text>They were on time and very professional.  They did the job quickly and we're friendly.  I wish more companies were as professional and courteous in Santa Cruz.  Too many companies do not call you back for weeks and then are late or don't even show up.
I will definitely recommend them to everyone I know and even those I don't.< /text>< Pics>

These people were amazing and fast!
Best service all the way around!
AND SO EASY I went line told them I wanted next day service at 9am and boom they were there on time no hassles and no delays. They accidentally knocked over a flower pot with a very expensive Neem Tree. I let them know about the broken tree but that wish time I could nurse it back to health over time but it was a major set back... The tree was $80.00 because I knew it would live I asked them for $60.00 reimbursement for the set back and boom no hassles in twenty minutes I had a PayPal credit, no fuss no hassles, just an we are sorry and you for letting us know. Great company I would totally use them again! 😁👍🏾</review>

I really appreciate Junk King for how swift they were with the job. We agreed for them to come earlier and it only took a few minutes. It’s expensive so I will definitely go back, just less often/with a bigger load.

Great service!! Highly recommend!!</Review>

The gentlemen that showed up were super friendly and early. I had the furniture in our front yard for them to take away and they had it loaded in less than 10 minutes.  Prices are very reasonable and I would definitely use them again in the future!</review>

<review>Al and Joseph did an excellent, professional job of tearing down and removing our old 8’x12’ garden shed with no damage to our garden.  Easy to work with and very conscious of project and Covid safety. I recommend this company.<//review>< Rate>

I absolutely recommend Junk King. We used their online estimator to help us have an idea of pricing, and booking online was easy and saved us $20. They even offered text messaging for questions before, during, and after booking, and they responded within minutes, which was extremely convenient. They called us within our scheduled window, gave us a time frame of their arrival, and arrived on time. Because we had everything together outside, the pick up was completed within 30 minutes, and they even gave us an extra $30 off for contactless/curbside pick up. We will be using their services again. Thank you for making this process easy and stress-free.</review>

Unprofessional. I scheduled a sofa removal for 4-6 yesterday and they didnt show up. I waited until around 7 to call them thinking the drivers might be behind because it was a particularly hot day. I called and the woman at the call center answered and said she wasnt sure what was happening but she would try to figure it out and call me back. She never did. So now i have my new sofa coming today and no way to remove this old one. I am disabled and cannot move it myself. One would think they would be more accommodating and at least call me back and dont leave me hanging.

Then I called this am and the guy who answered and i explained to him that they were a no show and i asked (trying to have my faith restored in the company) "is this how you guys operate?" And he replied with a cringeworthy "yes, thats how we operate"  that was enough for me to go with another junk removal service. Thanks for leaving me hanging and being completely unprofessional.< /review>

Excellent and quick professionals, they stuck to their estimate and provided excellent service, moving a ton of junk in under 15 minutes. Couldn’t be happier with the service of everyone involved.</review>

<text>Very nice men came to get our stuff, but we didnt receive the online discount, they pushed it to the very end of the time window, and I feel the price was very steep at 70 dollars for a small upholstered bench and a queen headboard.< /text>< pictures>

My experience was very good with the company. The three guys who came were very professional, nice and very fast in clearing out my junk. This is my second time using junk king and both time have been pleasant. The prices are reasonable and they arrived in a timely manner. I will definitely recommend and i will continue to use junk king in the future.<//text>

During removal of some equipment around my office, they shattered a window and will not reimburse me for replacement costs. The actual workers asked if there was any way they could settle things without telling their boss. They had no replacement windows on hand, so I called their boss, Mario Guzman, who assured me that they would cover any replacement costs, and sorry for the inconvenience. I got quotes, scheduled the replacement and have a functional office again. I have called multiple times once I had receipts, and have never had my calls answered or returned. I am now out of pocket more than I originally paid since they refuse to answer my calls. 0/10 would not recommend.</review>

The guys that came out (Jose and Robert ) were very nice, prompt and worked very hard.  I have already recommended Junk King to my family and friends and I won't hesitate to use them again if I ever need help hauling away items I can't use.  We appreciate that we were able to make an appointment and they arrived within the window we were given.</Review>

I would highly recommend Junk King!  They scheduled a pick up appointment right away and arrived on time.  They were courteous and quickly removed a large TV that we have tried to get taken care of for a while now.  It was so easy!  We will definitely be calling them again when we have another pick up.< /review>

You were on time, had two people who could do the lifting, picked up the load and were gone in 15 minutes.  Very reasonable prices, friendly service.  This is my second experience with Junk King and I have been more than pleased both times.  I will certainly use them again.< /Text>

This place simply knows how to please their clients. Constantly with a very nice mindset. The food is reasonably priced, constantly delightful and neat.< /Text>

This is the 4th time in 6 months that we were told we couldn't get any kind of hamburger because they were out of meat.  What kind of burger place runs out of meat?  Not worth the hassle.  To many other places to go.<//Text>

At least at BK, you can ask for extra ketchup and they won't make a face as if it were coming out of their salary like at McDonalds.</review>< Pics>

I didn't even manage to get inside!  My kids saw the large play structure and wanted to go.  It was lunch time, why not.

I walked over, front door is locked with a sign saying use the other door.  Do a circuit and find a single door in the back.  It was also locked!  Get back to the front, notice a sign on the door to the playground saying closed for repairs...  And yes front door is still locked.

Total waste of time.</Review>

This restaurant always seems to have a higher quality than others nearby.  You can see the difference in the way the food is prepared, and it seems more fresh.</Review>

<Text>The worst to date!! The manager was yelling so loud at one of his employees that had come in on his day off to cover and help the store. It still took the rude young manager almost 30 minutes and they were out of almost everything!! Keep in mind this was for a door dash. Unfortunately I will no longer visit this Burger King. It’s no wonder they can’t get or keep help.. might wanna get that figured out quick..<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Terrible, terrible food! Less than 1 minute after I ordered my fish sandwich meal it was ready!!!! Needless to say it was sitting there for a long, long time ( there was nobody else in the store at 6 pm) and then heated up in few seconds. Horrible aspect, the fish and the fries and the taste just as bad. After 1 bite I tossed it all in the trash ($8 if you can believe it). It's not the first time but it certainly was the last. This store should be closed to the public.The food here  is a first degree health hazard.< /Text>

I really like the quality of the food, and my son was happy with the toy he got with his kids meal. But there was a homeless man, the area seemed old and run down. I didn't feel safe there, and the bathrooms were yucky. Also, the play structure was outside and seemed old and gross, I didn't let my son play in it.< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>If I could give it a 0 star review I would. This place is horrible, dont go unless you're ready to wait 20 to 25 minutes waiting for your food in the drive through. I asked for an extra sauce and they wouldn't give me 1 for the wait. Didnt even tell me how much it would be if I wanted an extra one, they just told me I cant give you any extra, mind you I order 3 meals and couldn't give me 1 sauce. This is not the first time this has happened in this establishment and I wont be going there ever again, and you shouldn't either.<//Review>< Rating>

Fine, I suppose, for a Burger King... just don't be the guy who goes there at closing time and gets their last Whopper. I did that sometime ago and the burger they gave me had me puking my guts out in less than an hour. The exact same thing happened to my friend less than a year later. Looks like they leave the last one in the heater tray for weeks or even months, then serve it to whoever random person shows up at closing time. SHAME SHAME SHAME.<//Text>

Burger meat llooked as though it had been sitting for hours- cool, edges were tough.  Yuck.  French fries also had been sitting- not even warm.  Tossed meal when I got home.  And this was 1:00 pm!!  This should never happen.  Last time for this Burger King< /text>

< Review>
WORST BURGER KING ON THE PLANET. I came to the drive through just to find out they were closed at 8AM on a Monday morning!! Seriously???? And this isn't the only time this BK has been closed during their normal business hours. Very unreliable! Also their playground has been closed for over a year "due repairs". What a crock, they are just too lazy to clean it!!< /Review>

This location closed early around 8pm while their store hours on the window shows 10pm. They only let their family inside. I've noticed the quality of service went down hill. Pretty sad.< /review>

< Review>
Very rude!!! Have some very rude boy there. Obviously can tell he hates his life because he works there but not my problem? My grandma and I went to order and had coupons but didn't know they needed the coupon number at the voice box so I just ordered what we wanted and then expected them to scan the coupons or whatever when we went to pay. So we ordered then went up to the window and paid and the guy said since "WE" didn't give him the coupon numbers it didn't come out to the right amount so he has to delete the order and redo it because "WE" didn't give him the couple #. Then he stood there staring at us like we were suppose to say sorry or something? Also during all this he has quite a little attitude. Love the place, have been for awhile and very upset I had a bad experience< /Review>

Yulia Yartseva, NP, is a great and very thorough provider. I've been seeing her for the past year. She answers all my questions and addresses all the concerns. She was the 1st provider that noticed my abnormal heart sound. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants excellent care!< /text>

<response>None<//response><Text>This place has gone down hill since Dr. Brantz left. Takes for ever to get referrals. My wife broke her ankle and all they did was tell her "well, stay off your feet." No kidding? It took some badgering but finally got an orthopedic referral. Save your time and money and go some where else, this is a $$$ making operation where you'll never see a doctor.< /Text><rate>1</rate>< user>

Dr. Erinn Case is a by far one of the most conscientious physicians I've experienced in my many years.  She goes out of her way to review every aspect of her patient's medical needs and discusses all potential remedies in great detail. Her responsiveness to messages on mychart.com is exemplary, usually less than a full day. Besides that she's extremely personable and charming, which in its own way helps the healing process immensely.< /text>

<text>HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I arrived to my appointment 25 minutes early and they would not let me inside - a woman cracked the door open and told me their policy is that you must be there 30 minutes early. I told them about an accident on Balboa Ave and they didn't care. I said 25 minutes EARLY is still plenty of time to fill out any necessary paperwork. She would not let me in and told me they already cancelled my appointment. Wasted time and gas to leave work to be told that 25 minutes in advance isn't enough. RUDE!</text><user>113162634114395148371<//user></record>

Erinn Case is one of THE best PCP's I've known. And I'm not a kid.
She's one of the most knowledgeable professionals, her range of awareness of medical issues is immense.
She is extremely thorough.
and has a terrific "bedside manner" so to speak.
No ego, like so many doctors.
Awesome pro.<//text>

I have gone twice over past few weeks and they have been wonderful. They are working with me to help me feel better and last visit, Dr. Macy, patiently spent a lot of time to talk to me and give me the right path of interventions. I’m feeling better today more than I have for past several months. Thank you to all at the Pearlman clinic.< /text>

Professional and very courteous staff of doctors and assistants. My medical issue was quickly and properly diagnosed so that corrective action could be taken immediately. The Perlman Clinics are truly a 5-star facility.

A follow-up visit garnered the same level of professionalism and attention to detail. The staff of doctors and assistants truly amaze me with every visit, I know I am in the best possible hands for good health and general welfare. Although every medical facility is "reactive" to a particular situation, what sets Perlman apart from the rest is the "proactive" mindset they maintain to circumvent issues before they occur.< /text>

I was referred to Perlman Clinic by my employer when I needed some immunizations for a work trip down to South America. Everything was fast and easy. I booked my appointment through their user friendly online portal. On the day of my appointment I showed up about 5 minutes early abs the doctor was able to see me right away. I was in and out in under 30 minutes! Definitely the only urgent care in Clairemont I would recommend.<//text>

<review>This office is extremely organized, the staff and doctor (Dr. Brantz) are very friendly, and they have a great IT system supporting their medical operation.  This includes making appointments online and having access to your medical records via a secure portal which really makes it easy to get more involved with and stay on top of your health.  Also, LabCorp is right next door which makes it very quick to have blood samples taken and not need to have an additional appointment.  I could not be happier with this primary care physician's office.<//review>< pics>

<review>I am beyond impressed with this office and their staff. Each visit, you can tell they genuinely care and listen. I’ve had previous experiences with other doctors and it seems as if they just want to write a prescription and send you on your way. Terra, the PA, has gone out of her way to make sure I’m taken care of and for that I’m greatly appreciative. 10 times out of 10 I would recommend Perlman Clinic.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Came here this summer for a suspected UTI after just moving to the area based on reviews. Got an appointment for the next day and was seen right on time. My practitioner and the entire staff were kind and considerate, and I was very happy with the service I received - so much so that when they advised they do primary care as well I took their suggestion and saw them again for an annual check up. The facility is clean and easy to find. Definitely recommend.</Review>

I have been coming to this urgent care in Clairemont for over two years now and I have always received amazing medical treatment no matter which doctor I happen to see. I rarely have to wait at all, if I call ahead and set up an appointment, I can walk right in and see a doctor. I love how easy and care free they make it.</review>

I've had a consistent stomach ache for the past week, the other  day it was nearly unbearable and I went into Perlman clinic after reading a few reviews online. As I entered the door I was received by an extremely helpful and caring assistant and then met with Emily for a good amount of time. The immediate help from the provider not only made me feel 100% again, it felt like it came from a place of compassion and true concern (not rushed). This clinic knows how to treat people right< /Text>

< Review>
I'd been a few times (my mom and myself) and formed 2 cranky opinions.  No need to go into detail (cranky says it all).  Overall, the staff has been efficient and happy.  The doctor staff has been 100% impressive (esp. in hindsight).  Dr. Brantz immediately diagnosed a rash close to my eye I'd developed 18 hours earlier. He instantly, compassionately, calmly, told me I had shingles. He let me figuratively fall off my chair, and called one of the best opthamologists in S.D., at the end of the day, asked him to stay after 5:00, that I was on my way. Dr. Brantz literally told me to go there directly & immediately. This very likely saved my eyesight, because I miraculously got treatment within 72 hours (the magic window).  I'll review the opthamologist separately!< /Review>

I just wanted to personally thank Dr. Brantz and the rest of his staff for treating me so well over the past few months. I started a new job and it felt like I was getting sick every other week. This urgent care was my first stop because they are so close to my work and the staff and facility is so amazing. I never had to miss more than a day of work and sometimes I would even walk over here on my lunch break and they would always see me right away.< /review>

< Review>
I've gone here for several years for annual physicals and the occasional script for antibiotics, and have generally found the staff to be at least as responsive and accommodating as any other doctor's office. Their hours and 'urgent care' delivery model have been quite convenient during that time.

Recently I had cause to visit for a more serious reason, one week after breaking my hip in a cycling accident. I was shocked to discover the nurse practitioner had written a script for a reduced pain medicine frequency without telling me; as witnessed by my girlfriend, who was with me throughout this incident due to my limited mobility. Upon returning to the clinic to resolve the issue, I was twice shocked to find Dr. Brantz to be condescending and defensive. He first presumed to know that I was at risk of abusing pain medicine; and when I pointed to the reality of the situation (I am a physically active working professional with a recently broken hip with no history of substance abuse), took the opposite tack of pleading ignorance of hip injuries (pro tip: broken hips, surgically repaired with lots of hardware, are actually painful in the days and weeks immediately following the break and repair). He further suggested that he and the clinic were "doing me a favor for treating me at all" (even though my surgeon's office and insurance company had both asked me to follow up with Perlman; my PCP). Hippocratic Oath indeed. Finally, I was only at the clinic because my calls over the course of four hours that afternoon hadn't yielded a conversation with anyone besides the medical assistant, who could only pass messages. Dr. Brantz dismissed my question about the nurse practitioner not discussing the change in frequency with me during my visit. A legitimate question about ethics and process, which he just dismissed with a headshake and unintelligible muttering. Dr. Brantz closed his pontifications by suggesting that going to the clinic wasn't necessary and I should have called--as if I hadn't tried that for hours. After spending all afternoon before eventually getting resolution; I was left feeling angry and abandoned by the whole situation. I thought I had a relationship with the clinic after these years. I though Dr.'s were interested in patient well being. I thought communication with patients was inextricably tied to both ethics and outcomes. My calls to the clinic asking for Monica Perlman in order to resolve the incident haven't yielded a call back from anyone. Shame on Dr. Brantz and shame on Dr. Perlman.

If you need someone to order bloodwork or prescribe antibiotics, and you don't have a way to do it yourself; Perlman may be your most convenient option. If your care requires anything else, consider other options.<//Review>

Fast and professional medical treatment every time. I don't even understand why people to go the hospital when they are sick these days. With urgent care facilities like Perlman Clinic all over the city it doesn't make any sense. Half the time I come here I don't even have an appointment, I just walk in and they are usually able to see me right away. I lead a very busy work life and the last thing I can afford to do is waste two hours at the doctors office. At Perlman Clinic I can get in and out in little to no time!</Review>

<Text>I wish I could give this place a negative star. Worst place ever. Came early for my appointment, they got me started with weight and blood pressure taking, then lead me to a room and asked me to gown up after some questionnaire.  Gowned up 10 minutes before my appointment. Waited another 20 minutes after my appointment time. NO ONE came in. I did not want to wait any longer and told the front desk to cancel all my scheduled testings I came in to do, only to be told that the PA was too busy to see me at my appointment because there was an emergency. At least give me the common courtesy to let me know I will be waiting a while longer because of an emergency. Not one person came in during my time there to notify me of any emergencies, only until after I decided I was leaving. I was asked to come in by another PA prior because I was not feeling well and he told me he would like to run some tests to make sure my issues would be resolved through the test findings. He wasn't in yesterday, so i ended up scheduling with a PA named Samantha. I have never had to wait for any of my appointments but not once did she come in to say one word to me about having to wait NOR did she apologized to me for making me wait. Had it been the other way around, this place would try to pocket money from me if I made them wait or NOT show up for the scheduled appointment. Never coming back here. STAY AWAY.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Brantz is one of the best primary care physicians I have encountered in my almost 53 years of life. Experienced, empathetic, a great listener and considerate of best treament options for YOU. I have also recieved referrals from Dr. Brantz to two other local specialist physicians for procedures. With both of these referrals I also received superlative care. Dr. Brantz only recommends "doctors that he knows and has seen himself" Thank you Dr. Brantz and Perlman Clinic, Clairemont (at a really beautiful bay-view office)</Review><name>Patrick Hankey<//name><GmapID>0x80dc00484422740b:0x35eaf376b0bd688<//GmapID><user>115035235641969033447</user>< response>

My wife went in because of her back pain. The doctor ordered an X RAY from a clinic outside of our network (Imaging Healthcare). The exam came back clean but the doctor referred her to physical therapy anyways. When we confronted the doctor why was he prescribing a treatment without a diagnosis he did not have an answer. We decided to go for a MRI examination so we could get to the bottom of it. We called the office but we were told that we would need to come in again to get the doctor referral to the MRI(what??). So my wife went in again, we paid another visit and got the referral, guess where they referred us to!? Yes, the same outside of network Imaging Healthcare clinic ( apparently they do MRI's also). Surely, they were charging almost twice of what other MRI facilities were charging thus we decided to shop around. We called the doctor's office about a dozen times and every time they said they were going to send the copy of the doctor's order but they never did.  We spent almost 3 weeks going back and forth to get a copy of the doctor order. My wife had to come in and confront them personally. The receptionist however, said she could only give us a copy of the Imaging Healthcare branded doctor's order (refer to screenshot) which other MRI clinics may not accept.</Text>

<Text>Isamar and Dr Brantz are both terrific.

Isamar is courteous, friendly and efficient. She puts you at your ease right away. She's also lightening quick returning emails or calls.

Dr Brantz is a blast from the past. A doctor that sits down and talks to you about everything, not just the reason for that visit. More like catching up with a friend than an appointment.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with the Perlman Clinic.
Unfortunately I have been dealing with an issue that has brought me to multiple locations of the Perlman Clinic. However every staff member at all the locations I've visited have been kind, attentive, and prompt in the work that they do. Able to answer all of my questions and help with any issues I face. Seriously great staff. Would highly recommend to any one looking to see a Doctor/PA or medical assistant!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) They see that I am a foreigner. I refuse to show me medical treatment. I only have one doctor. Let me go somewhere else. The attitude at the front desk is very poor.
The front desk attitude here is very bad. It seems that I am a foreigner, so refuse me to see a doctor

他们看我是外国人 拒绝给我看病 说只有一个医生 让我去别的地方 而且前台态度很差

With some paper work, I left at ease and no longer worried about the financial situation at hand.  The employees were courteous and professional.  In particular, Destiny was superb and walked me through the easy process.

After driving around being denied at the other loan places and being in financial difficulties I wasn't in a good mood and was expecting to be denied. I talked to Myra who was really positive and informative, I got the $255 in about 15 minutes. Definitely coming back.<//Text>

I've been to the MV store shall we say more than twice and so far so good.  The young lady that recently processed my recent transaction has always been cool . I know when I get her window its quick, painless .  Nothing wrong with that !  If not for her I most likely wouldn't have replied to this .< /Text>

Speedy was something I could count on until I was late paying and then I was required to pick up at store rather than online. This caused a pro but lem since it was about 30 min to the nearest store. All in all, they were fair with no hidden fees and very reliable!!< /review>

Hello.,Where do I start first, Well on 04/21/2019, I was approached by my girlfriend earlier that day about applying for us a loan, to help us get a vehicle maintence for a vehicle  that was offered to us if we wanted it however; I was feeling a lil uneasy about applying for a loan in the first place, trying to get and keep good credit has been a job alone. To make a long story short, I was convinced to take a chance and the results were more than I expected, as we walked in the door we were greeted with a nice smile and a warm welcome. I like to point out that two of your employees that helped me with my experience there they were Ms. Destiny and Ms. Baleria , they were very professional and my visit there was one that I would and have been referring as many people as I can and of course giving a good review about Speedy Cash. Thank you and your generous staff for your services.< /Review>

Speedy Cash associates are great. The only bad thing is the lines. I was in there on the Friday before Labor Day. Most of the people I talk to are on Social security or disability, maybe have more chairs, or even have people get a number, which I wouldn't care for. The clients that were waiting were incredibly honest on who was next. That is the only bad thing I can say, you're so easy to deal with that you have a lot of clients. Another idea is that you stagger the due dates so everybody isn't coming in on the 1st. Thank you.</Text>

You are correct that our loans are high interest as they are intended for emergency  situations that require quick cash. We do not recommend using them as a long-term solution because they are higher interest. Hopefully we got the job done for what your needs were!'}<//response>< GmapID>

< Review>
I went here to get a haircut at Canyon Hills Barbershop, which is a great value and does excellent work. This little market is close, convenient and well-kept. This is my go-to place for quick shopping. I strongly recommend it.< /Review>

Canyon Lake Town Center has a few great convenient places and entertainment venues. Sports Stop is a great bar and pub. It's always active and fun. Pool tables, sometimes live music, and some pretty good bar food. Pretty decent service too. Canyon Cowboy has a decent restaurant, very nice bar, and live music. It's also a fun place. Expert Auto has become my mechanic for routine service and maintenance for my vehicle. Much more affordable than the dealership, more competent than the dealership, and faster than the dealership. Canyon Lake Market is a great little liquor store but better yet is their deli and meat counter. The Urban is a craft eatery. A great place to grab a breakfast. I haven't visited the entire town center but there's a lot in there.< /text>

<review>Like it's close too neighbor Sun City Plaza, old and outdated,with snooty customers driving expensive cars too boot. Nothing less than demolition and a redo is in order. And with the wealthy near by residents,they can afford it.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Visited Canyon Lake Animal Clinic. Dr Shell Robertson is the best Vet anywhere. Smart, caring and all around the best! The prices are very, very reasonable too. My step daughter brought her dog after a $5000 diagnosis for a torn ACL. They drive here from Carlsbad! Dr Robertson cost only $1250, and the dog is good as new! I've been taking my animals to Dr Robertson for almost 25 years. Your pets will love him, and you will too!</review><gmapID>0x80dc9d53efe7c143:0xc16b9e46daa8831b< /gmapID><userid>110316500411545765171<//userid>< username>

I hadn't been to yogurt deluxe in years, until a couple days after work I decided to try it again, and man did I make a great choice! I ordered the berry berry yogurt and not only was it delicious, creamy and cold, when I asked for raspberry toppings the owner filled the bowl and even went back to add more yogurt on top! I also love that its family owned and would totally recommend<//Text>

This is the best spot ever. The young lady who helps us out,spot on customer satisfaction (sorry didn't get your name). Stores always clean and the yoghurt simply divine. This place is perfect for taking the family. Even give you an option for 2 flavours in one cup. Highly recommend!!!<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>We love this yogurt shop! Small, family owned shop. Great flavors, lots of topping choices. Again parking is difficult due to the busy shopping center it is in. The couple who own the shop bring in books and magazines for an added benefit. The yogurt with toppings can get a little pricey, but it's well worth the taste! Hidden treasure for sure. No public restroom, so be prepared for that.</Text>< Pictures>

It was a nice establishment.  Friendly staff and very clean.  But honestly i didnt care for the yogurt.  I found the pralines on my yogurt tasted old.  My husband had the chocolate yogurt and i sampled a bite and i said "oh thats icky".  He said "ok it wasnt just me".  It wasnt busy when we were there so i dont have an explanation other than maybe we just came on a bad day?<//text>

<text>Waba grill is one of those places where you are bound to be happy with a rice plate.

My favorite go to is the half chicken and half beef plate. Both meats are too good to choose from.

They also have a new value menu which makes some of the plates a bit more affordable. You are bound to spend about $10+ but it is worth it.

Make sure to get extra waba sauce on the side as you may need it.< /text>< pictures>

Every visit, the food is excellent. The service is always A+ with friendly cashiers. The food is always made quickly, and they're generous with the green onions and WaBa sauce!  I love their fresh vegetable bowls with tofu. Everything always tastes good. Large enough portions. Recommend< /review>

<review>I LOVE Waba! I have a lot of weird health struggles and Waba has such wonderful food that works with what I need and tastes amazing! Their sauce is delicious and I could use it on everything. Their service is fast and the kitchen is visible from the main seating area so you can see them making the food. Which I love. I crave Waba all the time.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1579551258346, 'text': 'kelsey we are so happy to hear this and we hope to see you again very soon! :) Thank you!'}<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e82919d9c7cec3:0xb229d8f010b27e43<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
worst experience of my LIFE. got a coupon in the mail 2 plates 2 drinks $14.99. thought i would give it a try and take my wife here on a date. first impressions were every table was empty and filthy dirty. no one cared about the cleanliness of this place. cashier appeared high or drunk and  no uniforms were being worn , also not so clean looking. teriyaki station looked horribly dirty. sticky floors. food was dry and salad had some clear sauce that did not taste edible whatsoever. containers were filthy. was unable to sit and eat due to dirtiness. understaffed and the vibes i felt from the workers here were as if they didnt give a care about their jobs. its sad because i had such high hopes for this place but from the looks of the place it wont be around much longer. commercials are misleading. if you come here wanting to try something new, DONT. just stick with good ol panda. they wont let you down like this place. also the good reviews on here are probably from people who work here.<//review>

I had an Amazing delivery experience with WABA Grill. Not only was the online ordering process easy, and quick, but the delivery was pretty much on time (about 30 minutes late). Also, their plates are all very fairly priced Amazing, and HUGE!!! It was 2 FULL meals for me, but for light eaters, could easily be 3. Moving on, I have only ONE complaint, but that's ONLY for GRUBHUT, NOT WABA Grill. They said because they were late by about 30 minutes, that they would include something extra for free. Suffice to say, I didn't receive Anything Extra. So anyways, about WABA Grill, the one I'm reviewing. I called to ask for extra (teriyaki?) sauce, as their plates and bowls were Amazingly good, but they were just a bit too dry. The person I spoke with was extremely nice, and very helpful. So what did they do?  They didn't send 2-3 packets, or even a handful, but about 25-30 packs of it!!! To me, that was going above and beyond, for sure. Things like that make a Huge impact, to me, and just that will make me remember them over any other teriyaki restaurant. I still have sauce packets left, the flavor is amazing and could be used on any chicken, beef, or pork bowls, even. I RARELY ever write reviews, and almost NEVER this long. I hope this helps WABA Grill, even if just a bit, and hope it helps you decide to eat there. You won't be sorry!</text>

< Review>
It seems like a nice lab, with friendly employees. The issue is that they want you to make an appointment online for a Lab time. However, when you get there you don’t actually have a lab appointment. You stand in line along with drop ins to be seen. Be prepared to wait over an hour.< /Review>

Who is Susie? What is with “again”? These people have no clue how many angry patients they have I am gonna guess. Kaiser is cheap for a reason.

Pure evil. The doctors at Kaiser hate us. They do not properly treat their patients. Too many stories to share from too many ppl. I’m a victim as well and will never go back to them again.</text>

< Review>
The staff is always extremely helpful and polite. Parking here is far easier and closer than in one of the larger Kaiser centers. The pharmacy is located in a separate building across the parking lot. It's still convenient and a short walk. This is a smaller sattelite center and has limited services and hours.</Review>

The last time I went to this office I had a great experience. I was able to get my blood work done very quickly. The atmosphere is very calming and the staff here is very friendly too! It's not a huge office but the location is very convenient. It honestly beats having to go to one of the other huge Kaiser locations.<//Text>

<review>Kind of a weird building to find if you’re looking for the 220 east Hacienda avenue building. Once you find it on the little road though it’s easy as pie. Always great service, I never am unable to reach any of the departments I  need to talk to. They recently moved their pharmacy and their obgyn offices to the building DIRECTLY across from the 220 building. They will tell you the building address number but since it’s a little complex full of buildings the easiest way to find it is just to leave out the front of the 220 location and keep walking towards the building in front of you. :P

Lovely new building , lovely health care professional.</review><Date>1548797504341< /Date>< GmapID>

<review>I don't leave bad reviews but once in a blue moon, but if I could give them 0 stars I would. I have been a lifelong Kaiser member and this place makes me want to change providers. Campbell pharmacy used to be great till they moved it to the "new" building. I've had multiple experiences here, all bad. From waiting 2 hours to get meds after being told they would be ready in 20 minutes, to getting texts that my meds were ready and then being told they "weren't quite ready" and having to go back to the end of the line,  to standing in the check in line to get my all-ready phone-in prescriptions only to be told that they won't help me there and being directed to another line 20 people deep, my experience with them is consistently lousy. Not all, but a few of the clerks have zero people skills. Because its where my doctor is, everything is sent here but I'll be requesting other pharmacies from now on. Kaiser, next time don't get a brighter, shinier new building if it means you get a slower, uglier pharmacy.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1551108225755, 'text': "Dear Christina N., I'm so sorry for the experience you relay, regarding our Campbell Medical Offices' Pharmacy - I would like to assist.

It’s Walmart... but really do we need to lock up socks. I understand issues with thief but seems like a bigger deterrent to buy with slow customer service associates. Maybe busy with other customers I understand but really locking socks and underwear up< /Review>

This is the walmart store closest to my house. I enjoy shopping there but never thought of doing a review. My most recent visit I found a video game that regularly goes for $130 online or at other stores even the walmart website, but I guess my homestore had both variations for $90 brand new sealed box. Sometimes stores sell the same items at different prices due to its stock and exclusivity around the area. I got it but I had to wait like 15 minutes because there was nobody in the electronic area that could open the door for the game.</Text>

<text>I had a really great experience at Walmart today. I was in search for a bike and they helped me pick out the perfect bike for me. It’s been along time since I’ve ridden a bike and I was a little nervous about how I was going to get the bike home. She went above and beyond help me out to my car and even assisted me with putting the bike rack on the car. Thank you for the wonderful customer service I will definitely be back to shop at this location.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>This place gives me the feel of an unfinished Walmart, especially wgen you walk in. I can't put a finger on exactly what about it gives me that vibe. The staff(till) are friendly but the self checkout ones just seem bored. Its not a place I think to go unless I really need to go for something specific.<//Text>< user_name>

<Text>What can you say about a Walmart, especially a Super Walmart like this one.  They have a huge selection of just about everything from diapers to donuts and holding tank additives.  There service is pretty good as long as you aren't expecting any department level knowledge.  They have a pretty efficient customer service center which is good.  There fresh food here is also pretty tasty.<//Text>< Resp>

<Text>I went to this WalMart because I saw on the Walmart Website that a particular tv was available here and for a certain price. When I get there, the tv was priced $100 more. When I asked for help, it took 15 minutes for someone to answer my question about that. Eventually led me to the manager, I showed her WalMart website, the price and that it showed in stock there. She started giving me attitude for no reason at all and refused to help me any further. I walked out really upset. I forgot the managers name or I would name her on here. I'll never shop at Walmart again.<//Text>< Date>

<Review>While the employees were very nice, from the observation of many Walmart's I have been in this Walmart seems that it needs to be better organized to match the vast majority. As you visit Walmart's there is a set up theme that builds a level of familiarity and comfort for customers. Aisles are also very narrow.<//Review><time>1619747347932< /time>< Rating>

<Text>Good Walmart! It seemed like a a newer store. The carts are not located properly, they are not present where they usually go. The home office/copy paper aisle is not organized or restocked properly. I had trouble finding them initially- One of the staff simply replied “I DONT KNOW” when asked where can I locate copy paper. I felt not welcoming.</Text><response>None< /response></record>

Found what I needed.  Plenty of people stocking to ask, if not.  Only complaint is stock pallets block easy access to other departments.  Don't recommend shopping after 7pm, if this a problem to anyone else ...< /text>

<Text>This Walmart has come a long ways of the days when their cosmetic lady, who rocked one large unsanitary dreadlock, was the go to person for hygiene needs. Despite it being on the smaller side in comparison to other Walmart's nearby,  Its product line has become more consistent and despite this location not showing up for online pick up curbside available, for the community it serves, parallel to Pittsburg's one high school concept. Its keeps everyone close nit and flows with togetherness. Prices remain decent and at the same time teaching us just because it ends in ".97" doesn't mean its cheaper but 97 cent is less the a dollar! Shoot out to my ol' class mate the night store manager. Happier employees make a happier experience  for the customers< /Text>< pictures>

• Shares parking lot with Home Depot & Wingstop
CONs
• Took away in-store McDonald's

But even WORSE! I tried calling the local store to verify stock. Several times. They let the phone ring for several rings, then they hang up.

Good Job Martinez Walmart manager!

Nice good selection of clothes and clean store.
I was disappointed It was Thursday went to pay bills to donate money through
Western union. There were closed when the sign clearly said it should be open. Waited for someone to come but after 30 mints decided to shop and leave.
They should be 2nd person
If one goes on lunch break.
2 other people behind me had same issue. Hopefully
It doesn't happen again will try next week again.<//Text>

<Review>A disproportionate amount of the mens clothing is under lock and key. If you want to waste your time waiting for an associate to unlock, retrieve, and repack each item into a security box then go ahead. I waited for 25 minutes. I will never shop at Walmart again. Disgusting that people allow these corporations to treat us like this.<//Review>< Rating>

<Text>Usually a pretty good place to shop. I was just a little disappointed in the holiday decorations, or lack of. They didn't really have as big a selection of ornaments, lights, etc. as I would have expected them to have. They had quite a variety of Santa hats, and fake trees. But the selection of Christmas lights and ornaments was pretty slim. Otherwise checkout is relatively fast, even for the holidays, big selection of other products, and they even had plenty of paper towels considering most of the stores are out because of Covid.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Drove to Walmart from Pittsburg to shop , parked in Handicapped Parking
hobbled up to door heard schilling voice you got to go around . i left and
went home . Will not offer solution to such a moronic set up at the store
puts H A N D I C A P P E P  parking on one side then tells  those customers
to go walk thru traffic to come in the store . Will not return .<//Review>

<review>It's my local walmart. It serves the purpose. Although I have to say the McDonalds being gone did sting a bit. But my kids will live. Guess now they can repurpose the space.</review>< pics>

<UserId.>105351826271422794731</UserId.><Text>I'm writing a one star review to complain about this one transaction and the answer I received from the Walmart employee that was suppose to be assisting me.
I downloaded the walmart app and started adding items to my cart. At checkout I got offered free delivery or in store pick up. I didnt want to wait 2 days for delivery and since I'm going to the store anyways might as well shop around for other stuff.
Long story short I ordered water wipes for my new born on the app( cost $12.32)
While in the store I saw the price tag for the same wipes was $14 ish. I figured ill ask an associate for assistance to adjust the price. At the self checkout the associate told me that I have to pay the $14 or I can just order this online and pick it up once its ready. I told him this is literally false advertising. I understand the cheap online prices were meant to counter Amazon prices, but I think you still want to encourage your customers to walk the aisles and eventually make additional purchases.
I shop walmart for the instore experience. By trying to capture more online sales, you are pushing old school shoppers towards the web and eventualy Amazon.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

< Review>
I was looking for a vegetable steamer, went to the section I thought it would be and didn't find it. So I asked an employee, they said they didn't have it and offered nothing else. As I was leaving the store I asked another employee, I believe his name is Richard. Looked like he was busy with something else however he took a moment and looked the item up on a device that he had and walked me too the same area I was at and said they had 3 in stock. They had none. I was pleased with his service, not so much with the other employee and their inventory system. Good job Richard.</Review>

20 plus people in line for customer service, no one in the money department for the normal business hours. Associate would not page or call a manager to help me in money center. Made me wait at customer service. I explained that the money center closes soon and I don't want to miss it, lady said just wait in the main line. Of course this line took 40 plus minutes to get through, and lone behold, money center closed and would not help me. Has to be the worst managed store for walmarts I have been too. This is not the only instance this has happened. No one ever properly assigned to the money center.<//Text>

There were so many boxes in the isles, i could barely get through with my cart. The employee scanners were not matching the register prices. And the absolute frustrating incident was the cashier asking me to go and get the same item I intended on purchasing because it did not have a label on it.

<Review>For a Walmart store they didn't have a very big selection honestly. And there were more than a few things they had for sale that cost more than at other stores, which is very unlike Walmart.< /Review>< Name>

The workers that work over there are not very helpful
Some of them say they don't know
Now they have numbered the isles
Some workers at stores say no even without investigating
Though no doubt I shop over and I like Wal-Mart but workers aren't always helpful</review>

<Text>The returns line was very long (out the door), but the staff was all very friendly and allowed me to come back to the counter when I find my item to exchange.  The store had a good selection for the small size (compared to a super Walmart)  and seemed to be fairly well-stocked. (Some items were sold out in the coffee maker section).<//Text></record>

I always go to Walmart and shop  there because they have the selection and good prices although they have raised their prices proportionally.They need a friendly person at the exit gate not a rude person or manager who lucks customer service.</Review>

<Review>The employees hardly answer the phone and then when they do, they don’t make any effort to see if they have anything in stock. Three times They hung up on me during mid sentence. I asked if they had something in stock and when the employee couldn’t hear me correctly, they just hung up. I called again and told the employee that maybe our call was probably disconnected (even though I know it wasn’t) but she ended up hanging up again. It’s really frustrating and the customer service overall is horrible</Review>< Pictures>

It was clean but I don't like the fact that Walmart employees do not speak to customers.  If I walk down an aisle you're working on and I pass you, a simple "Hello...are you finding everything ok?" is in order. I also don't like having to wait for an associate to open the glass to get my toiletries. This is ridiculous to say the least!!! I will be ordering mostly from Amazon from now on!!!< /text>

I went there to pick up a couple items they did have a line but we're allowing people in four at a time. Everything was well stocked. The lines moved quickly. Despite all that is going on I was very impressed.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>This Walmart the employees don’t know where anything is . They don’t answer the phone I have been calling several times to speak to a manger they let the phone ring and hang up . Very unprofessional and disrespectful. Furthermore my wife and I went today and a lot of the employees have their masks under their nose during a pandemic where thousands are dying . I took pictures of everyone and will be sending them to the health department to let them know .!
Covid is not being taken seriously at this location. My wife has a bad heart and shouldn’t have to worry because employees are not following state guidelines.
Maybe Walmart should be fined and they will comply< /text>< Pictures>

I must admit I don't go to Walmart all that often, when I have gone to Walmart, and when I go to Walmart. This is the location that I go to. Not real convenient for me to get here, it's at least a 20 minute drive from where I live. They have great prices.<//Text>

The value was good however the customer service was awful. My cashier demonstrated two speeds: slow and extremely slow. Sloth like. Lastly, it was very warm inside,and I observed people NOT wearing masks. I'll think twice before going back to this Walmart.< /Text>

This rate has been given because I was waiting for more than 25 minutes for someone to assist in the jewelery department. After all that waiting someone was able to assist. Then after I had to go in line in a specific register so I can check out!!!
This was totally absurd.
I hope they can keep up with their departments and customer service.< /review>

Was in and out fairly quickly. Would have been quicker but I only money which forced me a slower lane. As I am still alive, I must've gotten over the slight delay.</review>

There's not really enough space between the racks for the shipping carts to turn. They are always out of stock of Walmart brand k-cup pods, which is their brand. 🤔 what's the deal with that?</text>

The line outside what's long but it was moving. Could not really find everything I needed inside they need to restock their shelves. The money order machine what's not working that was the main reason I came to the store. The customer service person told me that it hasn't been working for two months now and I drove all the way from Antioch.. very upsetting<//review>

Not Covid Friendly. The taller older man that works in the camping department kept pulling his mask down. I wouldn't mind too much except that he kept walking right up next to me to stock shelves. When I pointed out to him that masks are required in the store he said, "Whatever. It is what it is." So I promptly told him what I thought of him. Also there are too many cust and no social distancing is possible.</text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>I took my daughter for a little summer/back to school shopping.  We purchased multiple items in various sizes because the fitting rooms are closed.  When I tried to return the clothing items that didn't fit, I was told I could not return clothing.  I was given no date that I could return the clothing or another option to return via mail.  I find it irritating that Walmart did not inform us of this by posting signs or some advising us BEFORE we purchased.  Someone has filed a class action lawsuit claiming this is unfair to pause clothing returns during this difficult financial time. I found links in the article about the suit how to return items purchased in store.  The employees are ill informed or don't care to share this information with me at the return counter.  Shame on Walmart to make people keep items rather than be good company and steal/hold hostage people's money. One positive note, my daughter liked her purchases.</Review>< Pics>

But today when I went they had ALL THE COSMETICS LOCKED UP, it was a little over kill. I had to call and wait for someone just to get an eyebrow pencil. Not to mention I probably would of spent a lot more money in that department if I could of just thrown things in my cart. I was disappointed that this is how they have it now. At least in Pittsburg the cosmetics is a separate department that you can walk into.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Made a purchase for pickup at Martinez. Went to the pickup area and called the posted number twice, no response. Employees told me to go to the back of the store and that was the pickup area. The lady handled the order very well. I headed to the front door to be stopped by the guard because I didn't have proper exit papers. The gathered employees decided to call the lady from the back to vouch for me. She came, vouched and finally I was freed so I could leave. Will I use pick-up again?< /text>< Pictures>

Stuff on shelves didn't have the correct price near it.

I tried to buy some brown rice(not priced) and the cashier refused to sell it to me because it wasn't in their system.</review>< pics>

<review>All cosmetics are now behind locked doors, which is super annoying when you're just trying to get one nail polish and check out. After they get the cosmetic out of the locked cabinet for you they put it in another locked box that you have to carry to check out.< /review>< pictures>

During the height of Corona frenzy, this location was well-stocked, aisles were clean, and staff were all very cheerful despite the stressful times. I am very impressed by this particular store. Even the optometry department staff are really nice!</review></record></dataset><record>

I went back hoping the experience the first time was a fluke. I cannot stand it when any person of any background claims discrimination any time things don't go their way but I must say that the management at this store is somehow so unprofessional and couldnt care less for the customers and both times I've had them make extremely and deeply hurtful, offensive remarks and do things to intentionally humiliate me and others as well.

As per usual,  they say something is in stock online, and per usual it is not.
I should know better than to bother even thinking about Walmart for anything.
Customer service is obviously a thing of the past, so sad to see it die.<//text>

< Review>
It is the worst WalMart I have been in, customer service is a lot of the time terrible, I was waiting in a checkout line today, I was going to be next and the cashier turns off him light and tells me he is closed, went to the next register with a light on and as I get in line she turns off her light and says I am closed. There store stock is terrible and takes weeks for a lot of items to get restocked. A lot, not all, of the employees are rude. The list can go on for a long time.</Review>

You can always count on Walmart. They usually have what you need. I went to 2 auto part stores and the prices were high.  I ended up leaving there and going to Walmart. They had what I needed and they were less expensive.< /review>

Walmart is as Walmart does. The front door staff is very friendly during this time of global pandemics. Things are fairly inexpensive. Sadly many of the workers there are not very helpful when you have a question. There is one guy in electronics however who is. He is friendly and knowledgeable. One thing that I really dislike about the store is that they removed the self price checkers and you have to wait to check a price. Then I was told by an employee that I could check on my phone. I did and the price was wrong which creates more of a delay. Still, the store is what it is.<//Text>

Walmart has the lowest prices car batteries, $54.85.  Unfortunately if your store does not have an auto service center you must stand the customer service return line to get a battery core refund $12+tax..< /review>

Einstein the service dog loves Walmart. They have very friendly staff, are dog friendly, and have a wonderful selection. It's always nice when you can shop with your best canine friend.< /text>

The prices in Walmart have risen drastically. The shelves are not neat. Some items are difficult to find and staff is sparse so it is difficult to get help.</Review>

We went there to use the money transfer services.  It was fast, easy and efficient. Much cheaper than MoneyGram or Western Union. The lady who helped us was excellent.</Review>

Walmart is Walmart. This one is okay, not especially dirty or disorganized. But if you don't mind travelling a bit further the super Walmart in Antioch is nicer.<//Review>

Went here last night (July 30,2020 at 8pm)to return my three furnitures that weights 300lbs or more.Rented a utility trailer at u-haul just to return all these furnitures(2 recliners & 70” tv stand).A stranger helped me out to put all these furniture to each walmart  trolley.Push them one by one at the entrance and to my surprise returns is already close.Spoke to a lady guard & male store staff,they won’t accept returns anymore because it was close an hour ago.Spoke to 2 managers named KIRSTEN & didn’t see the name of the other manager (Mexican lady with curly hair).I beg & beg to at least consider my returns but both of them didn’t offer some help.Both of them are very inconsiderate & inhumane.I know that even if they close the system they can do something to help me or at least offer to leave the furniture inside and make a note of it or endorse the return whoever comes in the morning so  when I come back in the morning they can easily do the return process.But both of them are in a rush to go home or lazy to do it.They did not consider how heavy it was the furniture,they didn’t care how i’ll bring back in these furniture in the utility trailer and carry back home by myself “that is extremely inhumane”.I was once a manager & I know that they can do something about it but refuse to do so & chose to be heartless in the middle of pandemic.< /text>

Honestly. if I could give 0 stars I would.
This all started when I tried to return a defective air mattress within 4 days of buying it. It would
Not hold air. Chris the coach. Not even a manager. calls me a fraud and a liar and kicked me out of his store. He was a bully towards me. All I wanted was a new one that worked.. he wouldn’t listen to me because he interrupted me every time I tried to talk and say I don’t understand why I can’t return it and why I have to exchange it. I was crying in their store because he treated me so horribly. What a bully.. I hope he gets fired. Wish google let me add videos for y’all to hear how he was treating me in front of my daughter.<//text>

Well stocked. Food prices (any Walmart) are higher than average for a discount price store.< /text>

<Text>I bought an item less than 30 days ago. Their website says that their exchange/returns policy without a receipt at 90days was ok.  I called to just double check that I can exchange for the same item, they shot me down..they need to be reading their return policy as very closely. I didn't want my money back, just an exchange..unbelievable.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Plan on being there for awhile!! Long check out lines no matter when you are done shopping. They don't have any hand held baskets or mobility carts at this store. Regular carts are not always in front of the store.   Most of the time floor staff is not helpful at all. They don't always have things in stock or on the shelf.< /review><user>103620766450661389318<//user>< user_name>

During these times most stores I have visited have signs posted letting customers know that mask are required.
I waited 20 minutes in line to be told I need I need  a mask to enter the store.
Please post signs so the public knows.
No all stores are requesting the public to wear a mask.</Review>

Okay two stars is not disliking Walmart. No stars is disliking Walmart. Two stars is tolerating Walmart. We all know what I'm talking about and we all know why we don't want to go there. When we go there we go there because we're forced to. We have to. It's never fun. Well...It's hardly fun. Mostly it's a drag but many things are and nevertheless you have to do them Walmart is a necessary evil. Two Stars is nothing to be ashamed of when basically you're the retail equivalent of the devil.< /text>

This store is bias when it comes to customer service. Every time, I shop there, I get profile. There was no sign regarding buying 1 toilet paper (packagr) per customer. Another customer bought 2 toilet paper package and they let him off. I filed a complaint and they brushed it off. Never going there again.< /review>

This is a tired little Walmart. If you really need something you MIGHT find it here. This store has really limited selection and brand choices.</text>

I will have to say that today's experience was very good. They have done some remodeling of the store, since I was last there. I didn't shop the whole store, but the men's clothing section, and shoe section have been expanded. The employees were friendly, pointed me in the right direction to find what I was looking for. The cashier bagged my groceries by category  so like items were together. She was to go on break after she was finished with me, but took another customer, who only had 4 items, before she took her break. The food section was as usual. Some empty shelves, and some items I was looking for weren't there. Overall, it was a good shopping experience.<//text>

Seems like Wal-Mart has no heart I have worked 13+ years have never gotten a promotion l can barely pay my rent.I have passed the manager test twice now I got sick and I am told that I can't use my 127 hours of sick time to cover my time off sick without it I can't pay my rent When I started my rent was 750$ now it's 1475$ I can't pay all off it this month with out my sick time to cover my time off.last year I hurt my back pulling water pallets and went to the doctor they. sed I have a compressed spine.I am not to lift more than 25 lbs but they still want me to The manager of the store sed if I get hurt on the job again that they are not responsible so l can't go on disability Does that sound right.Thay pay new hires the same or more than employees that have been working for years.thay say it is Wal-Mart policies from corporate office .My son worked with me 1 year he got sick and when I went to work he died I couldn't take off to take him to the hospital Every time I go to work L cry because he's not here The door greater get paid more than stockers and the truck unloaders They call greeters loss prevention now We have to pay for our own healthcare when I worked some other places they paid for it< /Review>

Horrible store that the very few times I've been in (just to send money) I was ashamed I had... Post incredible profits every year and can't even pay a living wage to its employees... I don't care how low their prices are I refuse to go there to buy anything... Please, go somewhere else...< /text>

Great place to shop. The prices are not always going to be the same as the website. You can order from the website and pick up at the store,thus getting the website prices. Watch for clearance tags. Clearance deals can be as low as 20% of original prices.</Text>

<text>The in store only buy items should say out of stock if you have been out of stock for weeks now ... its frustrating coming from 2 cities away just because you said in stock twice and you were out ...shelf was empty... so empty it was dust collecting.<//text></record>

Friendly staff and employees. My go to store when I need something quick or at a reasonable price.  Sometimes I am there daily getting items I just realized I was out of. Lots of toys to choose from for the kids also.<//text>

<text>Took four times asking someone to open a cabinet so I could buy an item before someone actually showed up to open it.  I understand it was busy however, back to school time... So it wasn't really a problem, just a bit annoying.  Took about 15 minutes ti get what I was after.  It is a nice and clean store. The workers I've delt with are helpful and nice.<//text>< Pics>

Shelves are always extremely low on stock or shelves are empty. Grocery part of store always sucks. By far, this is the worst Walmart ever! Walmart should be ashamed of this store. The checkout people are very nice. Martinez deserves a better Walmart. Come on Walmart-You can do much better than this-where is your pride!</Review>

<Text>I went in for bananas because I've gotten them there before but I guess they don't sale much  produce anymore.  All I could see was a few tables with empty baskets except for some bags of lemons and potatoes.  I also couldn't find any rice cakes I asked an employee he pointed me to the grocery section but I didn't see them so I just want to Lucky down the street.   I've noticed a lot of homeless and people up to no good on the side parking lot so I had to worry about my car getting broken into the whole time.  Sad use to be a great place to shop.</Text><username>Rudy Garcia</username><user_id>107918444967670234666< /user_id><Date>1563397502953</Date><GmapID>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69</GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< rating>

Went there to find something specific. I got to the section and the shelf was empty and items were put into the wrong spot. I thought the item I was looking for was out of atock, but it turns out someone put the item back wrong causing me to think the store was out of stock when it wasn't. I did find what I was looking for in the end,  but took a little longer than I wanted. Plus side the self checkout had no line and was perfect for my one it check out. Walmart please restock shelves and make sure items are in the correct spot.</text>

Cozy medium store. Great place to buy stuff on a budget, though most of those products, as you know, are junk, some others, well, just accessible to most pockets.
This is place is on a great location, you can get lost for you have to drive a few blocks into the neighborhood before you can see the store. People there are amicable, though needs much improvement customer service wise. This place has all you need from a Wal-Mart on a tiny scale, so, sometimes they run out of products – but they are very good at keeping a good stock of items.
What I like from this Walmart is their employees whom in my experience do not hide from you, the customer, and try their best to help you out.
This place, any ways, needs more people willing to organize this on 24/7, sometimes customers make a mess and stuff cannot keep up with it. Like other shopping places, avoid crowded times, save yourselves from a head ache and try to shop during the early morning hours.
A plus here, this is not in a ghetto town, so it is a much safer environment to shop. But always be on the guard for there had been instances of “bad people” trying to make bucks from others, so be careful and park on well lighted areas. There is security on the parking lot, but you know, there is always that day.
Better to go during the day, roads are super crowded during afternoon times.</Review>

Went today to buy a vacuum.  Had to load it in the basket myself no clerks around to help.  Asked for help to load it in my car, cashier went out of her way to talk to the door check out man who said just look out in the lot for a basket man.  Got out in the lot and not a man in sight with the yellow vest on!  The vacuum cleaner box was heavy and ackward for me to pick up...twice at that!<//Text>

In a word. Horrible. Racks depleted of product. Worse than the Richmond store. These are by far the worse Walmarts I've ever seen.  They turned me into a "whatever else store there is besides Walmart" shopper. ...Jeezus weezus!!<//text>

Walmart well it's a Walmart they're all pretty much the same this one is pretty quick when it comes to long lines as all the things that most Walmarts have. I recently bought a TV from there and it was a good deal. That's one thing about Walmart just a lot of good deals just about all the time< /review>

The grocery section is small and cramped. Prices are reasonable / Walmart-low. The store is a bit messier than the average Walmart.  Staff are very personable and helpful.</text>

Walmart tends to have everything one may need and more. Everytime I go into Walmart I always leave with more than I intended to purchase. The rates are great and lines or never too long and I'd they are, self check is always an option.<//Text>

Walmart well it's a Walmart they're all pretty much the same this one is pretty quick when it comes to long lines as all the things that most Walmarts have. I recently bought a TV from there and it was a good deal. That's one thing about Walmart just a lot of good deals just about all the time<//review>

I wanted to buy a hair trimmer. Had to wait for about 20mins for someone to open the locked case that the trimmer was in but i was expecting it because of how busy they were. There was a long line at the register but it went fairly fast.</Review>

Low prices and self checkout makes for a cheap and quick shopping experience. Although, items can sometimes remain out of stock for awhile. Best to get there early before item is depleted because they only restock the shelves at night after close.</Review>

This Walmart is fantastic. They sell everything. Seriously. We went to this place the other day to get a phone fixed, and we ended up with bows for presents, two floodlights, Fabuloso, and more. It is so convenient. They also have an assortment of fresh foods that you can get. They also sell clothes for all people, shoes, electronics, makeup, home decor, bikes even, toys, and a lot more. I highly recommend this place< /review>

What to say about this location in Martinez dot-dot. It's really the most horrible at customer service in the whole store oh, but there is a light blond lady in customer service who is the exact opposite, and quite exceptional all by herself. I wish I could recall her name that she was smiling friendly and more than helpful at every opportunity and incidentally I came across her again and check cashing and she was just the same amount of pleasant Vibes and smiles. As for the rest of the staff oh, they seem to think everybody there is out to get over on them oh, they follow you around and make you feel somewhat like a criminal just because you were there for an extended. Of time shopping 2 hint hint people spend money. Forgive me if I have a little bit harder time than most because of a leg disability that my LinkedIn store does not indicate my intention to pay for my items. Aside from that it was rather clean from past experiences but I will comment on the fact that when you do need somebody to help you there's no one in sight to do so so work to be done still</text>

Great place to go for your shopping needs. ( camping, family vacation, home maintenance, personal hygiene products, laundry etc... )If you need it they will most likely have it and if they don't home Depot is across the parking lot...</Text>

I had a bad experience with the money center. I attempted to cash a 401k check which their website says they clearly do. The woman at the register at 4 o’clock on 1/31/19 made it seem like I was attempting to scam her. She asked me why I didn’t take the check to my bank, and a lot of their personal questions and finally she just refused to do it. It’s none of her business what I choose to do with my money and I didn’t appreciate her hassling me. I won’t be shopping at this location ever again.< /text>

This Walmart has a wonderful Pharmacy Dept. They are conscientious, very courteous, and I felt, they really cared about my perscription needs. The head pharmacist is very professional as well as a compassionate individual.</review>

Worst customer service ever. Had to wait in the bike area for nearly 20 minutes for help. Other associates that walked by would just walk away when I tried to ask for help. The only bright spot was that the checkout cashier was friendly.< /Text>

No one is ever able to help you find stuff! Even the employees don’t know what they have in their store lol I asked three employees that where are the fabrics by yard? And all THREE said they don’t have any😂. But surprisingly I found them in the aisle with crafting stuff lol<//Review>

The parking lot is always full and inside the aisles pretty narrow.  Alright for quick stuff.  Try checking out through the garden section.  Usually not too busy.<//review>

This store is a mess, shelves more than half empty, no posted pricing for most household needs such as paper towels, rude employees, asked for help from an employee for help getting something off a top shelf and was refused.<//text>

She didn't use a glove when she put the bun for my amber in the toaster and I felt like she was being rude when I asked for the equal for my tea then she made me wait for the fries and told me that everything was done except for the fries and it turned out the fries were already done and she made me wait so my hamburger got cold I feel since I wasn't Mexican or Hispanic she made me wait and my hamburger got cold they need to get some people back there that are not rude or discriminate against other people<//text>

Aisles are not wide enough for 2 shopping carts and an employee loading shelves with inventory.  Sometimes it is really frustrating that it is so crowded in the store.  Parking can also be difficult.  But the prices are good.<//Text>

The food, drugs, and toiletries were missing a lot of items. Empty boxes broke down and spread out in the aisles. Very low rating for this store. I went to a Super Walmart yesterday, and it was wonderful.<//text>

Went at 7 when they opened to by pass any crowds a quick in and out I was wrong they had almost nothing I went for nun of the shelves were stocked my app and the store prices were different and only one checker with two people in line with three baskets full which was confusing seeing that the store had only been open for 15 - 20 minutes needless to say it was watsed time didn't have what I needed long long wait just to buy a few items walmart in Richmond as way better service always stocked and a better and more helpful staff very dissatisfied</text>

<rating>1</rating><text>Every single time I go to Walmart for anything, they don't have what I came for!!

Last week I went for a simple vacuum belt. Guess what? They didn't have it.

Computer monitor?... Nope.

Kiddie pool in the summer time?... Out of stock.

A tube for boating?.. Hell no.

Life vests? ..Only if you're an XXXL person....

Vacuum bags???  -yes. But only for every vacuum except yours...

Picture frame? -Sure. But not any that will fit your photo...

These, amongst many others are things I went to buy and they did not have.< /text>< pics>

<review>Lack of a grocery section that had anything other than a few displays with some crappy looking fruit, and some freezer isles that were depressingly stocked, etc, etc.  However,  the person who assisted me in checkout was nothing short of an awesome human being, I give her the highest praise for working as hard as She does to make her customers happy.  She worked in the cigarette and alcohol checkout line the day I shopped. ... basically, this Wal-Mart needs a serious overhaul.  I don't recommend this location.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1544654917237<//Time><Review>The Holiday Rush is alive and well at this Wall Mart. The isle's were packed with people and merchandise. I think every check stand was open and people lined up. I got lucky and had a checker that had issues with the register, prices, reciept paper seemed like everything was causing her issues. She was nice and kept her cool though. The store was surprisingly clean and picked up, maybe because it was 1:30 - 2:00pm.
I found just about everything I went in for. Once I left I remembered about 5-6 more items I should have picked up,does that happen to you to?
Oh well have a Merry Christmas.<//Review><UserId.>117891807655249731347< /UserId.><user_name>JC Jones< /user_name><rating>3< /rating></record>

Prices are good, but quality isn't the greatest. And watch out if your car ever gets hit in the parking lot. They have cameras, but when someone smashed my door in, while I was shopping, they were too lazy to check their camera footage.<//text>

Not to crowded but shelves were messy and it was difficult to figure out prices. They also were out of stock on a lot of items.
But lots of friendly staff<//Review>

Medium size Walmart store- I've seen way bigger- but you will find what you need and more. Safe, clean and with lots of parking available. Rush hours and weekends gets very busy abd the wait for check stands is to consider.</Review>

< review>
No Stars for this store at all. 0 stars after hearing years of ugly disappointment, disapproval, remorse and grief.  I have only experienced this degree of rudeness and lack of concern during my visits to former communist Russia.

I've Been shopping Walmart for nearly 40 years and I have lived near this store for over 15 years. I agree with half of these reviews being the minimum of 1 star.

. Where people having money to spend are definitely envied and a target for abuse. If you want to be treated like a fool and a red headed step child, many years have proven that this is the place for you. Most my family and friends prefer to either pay more or travel twice as far to 2 other walmarts in very dangerous neighborhoods than to visit this Martinez store.

Why the management and workers are still in place, or why this can go on for so many years is just an absolute bewildering quirk to the American shopping experience and Sam Walton's credo.  They should just simply close this store.

And if your still reading this and expect the telephone service to be a work around, be forewarned. Time and repeated neighborhood stories have proven that you are not a paying customer, you are a pain in the neck that will be dealt with by a holding for 10 -15 minutes waiting for your privilege to speak to someone who will also not have a satisfying answer or treat you with respect.

Just shut this store down it's giving the Martinez area a black eye. Better yet drive a mile south and visit Target on Contra Costa blvd. But please close it's doors for good or give it a head to toe overhaul with comment cards being your guide.</review>

<Text>I’d put 0 stars if I could because they don’t even deserve 1star. The customer service here is horrible. Super rude. Very unpleasant, don’t try to return anything here. Even with a receipt they told me no?? I wanted to exchange some ink I bought which was Unopened and just as I bought it perfect condition. I mistakenly got the wrong number and they First Lady said yes they can do that then the manager came to approve it and was so jaw dropping rude I couldn’t believe it. She was snatching stuff out of my hand and told me no we can’t do this. I don’t no what her problem was but she treated me as if I was doing something wrong. I spent almost $100 on that ink and I didn’t want my money back I just wanted the right ink. She acted as if I was taking something from her. I was blown away at how she treated me. So I calmly said ok no problem and I’ll go 2 a different Walmart. I’ve never been treated like that. She should be fired, I wish I had gotten her name. It was an older white lady with grey hair in a pony tail. Watch out for her she a witch. I hate this walmart.<//Text>< pics>

for the most part rude, and dirty. I asked the guy at self checkout to break a twenty for me and he very politely told me he couldn't but that the money center could so I went there and the woman very snottily told me that she has to call a manager to open a till. So I said okay...and she snapped at me saying she is not calling a manager to open the till. So I said okay thanks the costumer service here is awful. As I was walking away she looked at a women in the corner and states we don't sell money here.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

As the only Walmart in the Martinez Concord area, it is relatively well stocked but hard to be positive about anything else. Staff can be unfriendly, and I do not appreciate having to have my receipt scanned when exiting store as if I am a criminal attempting to walk out with unpaid items.< /Text>

<Review>Manager refuses returns from three weeks ago, even with the receipt. Rude and discourteous, he tried to day store policy wouldn't allow it without the original box so I showed him the store policy which didn't mention this and he still refused.

The line for getting out of the store was long as there was only one person checking receipts and some people start yelling. But was able to find the items I was looking for, for a good price.</Review>

I bought a Straight Talk wireless card and as to make sure it was turned on properly by the cashier they did not turn it on pot properly so I'm now out $45 and time nagravision I even talked to a man in the Philippines or tried to help me at Straight Talk he said it was not turned on properly and now I have to go back to Straight Talk and trying to get my money back because of Walmart people not being able to do their job properly.<//Text>

Most of the times I had exelent experience here. Today I founded everything but the cashier was to rude, probably feels tired. I think  people like her needs to work with products but not directly with clients.<//text>

<text>No Stars for this store at all. 0 stars after hearing years of ugly disappointment, disapproval, remorse and grief.  I have only experienced this degree of rudeness and lack of concern during my visits to former communist Russia.

I've Been shopping Walmart for nearly 40 years and I have lived near this store for over 15 years. I agree with half of these reviews being the minimum of 1 star.

. Where people having money to spend are definitely envied and a target for abuse. If you want to be treated like a fool and a red headed step child, many years have proven that this is the place for you. Most my family and friends prefer to either pay more or travel twice as far to 2 other walmarts in very dangerous neighborhoods than to visit this Martinez store.

Why the management and workers are still in place, or why this can go on for so many years is just an absolute bewildering quirk to the American shopping experience and Sam Walton's credo.  They should just simply close this store.

And if your still reading this and expect the telephone service to be a work around, be forewarned. Time and repeated neighborhood stories have proven that you are not a paying customer, you are a pain in the neck that will be dealt with by a holding for 10 -15 minutes waiting for your privilege to speak to someone who will also not have a satisfying answer or treat you with respect.

Just shut this store down it's giving the Martinez area a black eye. Better yet drive a mile south and visit Target on Contra Costa blvd. But please close it's doors for good or give it a head to toe overhaul with comment cards being your guide.</text><Date>1449457815770< /Date>< pictures>

This Walmart is always so dirty, and employees are not very helpful or friendly.
The front row parking spaces in front of their building are always filled up by their own employees!!! Seriously? Shouldn't they have designated spaces for them to park?</Text>

<review>Wal-Mart is a nice store. The parking lot has many empty spots to park at. There is a huge variety of products and many deals. The prices are low. They also have plants In the outdoor part of Wal-Mart. There is also this one section were you can get any movie for  $5!!! There is also many spots for self check out if you like self checkout. Recommend for all.</review>< pictures>

If you found something online and want to check if it's in stock, be prepared to call back 6, count 'em, 6 times before getting past hold and getting an answer. You could write a training manual on what a bad customer service experience is, during your time waiting on hold.<//Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Very crowded. Placement of items in center isle near last checkout is a mess. People in scooters and wheelchairs would have a very hard time getting around this area. Always conjested and backed up with the amount of people coming in and out of the area. The checkout line blocks access in that area. So people have to stand and wait to get in or out because of all the stuff put in the center isle along with people standing in line. There is never any sanitary wipes for the handles for the carts that are sticky it is always empty.< /Review>< resp>

Nothing to add. It is a Walmart after all. I have to say this one  seems to be less messy and slightly more organized  than the one in Pittsburg.<//Text>

Smaller Walmart, but I asked where something was...it must be a new policy to bring customer to what they need or find out where what you want is, nice service. Easy to shop there,  lots of parking< /Review>

This Walmart needs an overhaul. The grocery department is sorely lacking in anything fresh or organic. Limited choices. Not the place to shop for anything but junk food. Let's wake up walmart, the times are changing.</review>

<name>Pammie Sanders</name><Date>1539094560133</Date><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Hello it's Walmart the company isn't union they barely want to pay these guys for the work they due it's not only up to them how about we customers stop bring those bad a.. kids tearing up and down the aisles knocking and pulling and just making a mess in store buy it or leave it just stop making a mess of it and blaming the short staff . This store by far beats that huge Antioch store where every staff member is having a bad darn day and is rude, and by far the rudest of them all is Pittsburg I mean the staff there is the bottom of the barrel of nasty rude disrespectful and has no shame in being rude to there customers.  I wish I was a secret shopper would have fired at least five on the spot. I truly hate this Walmart  and was almost robbed poor lighting in parking lot stay away ladies at nite if by yourself. Dangerous area again poor lighting need lots of cameras and lighting outside. Yes Martinez store not perfect but they beat the others by miles . Now good finding that perfect Wal-Mart.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Williams in the sporting section was very rude and disrespectful. 20 min to close I walked in to purchase  co2 cartridges and Williams told me he had no key to open the cabnet because they were with his drawer and they had already took it which also ment after being passed around from rude employee to employee I was not able to purchase my items there and had to be walked to the front to check out. I have had many issues with this person several times in the past month or so.</Review>

OK really, who hasn't been to walmart? Even rich snobby people go here,  although they wouldn't admit it. They have good prices, a lot of variety, my only wish is that this was a super walmart.< /text>

Nice and clean not messy . Other Wal-Mart braches kinda junky and parking lot full of 😗#@@_$&$# cars and people.
At least for now, aside from that Wal-Mart prices are 30%
Lower than where I live that's for sure.
A box of cereal in my area cost $4.99 and Wal-Mart $2.98.< /Text>

<Text>Great place to shop plus lots of ladies everywhere. Or guys for those ladies. Anyways don't expect customer service they don't do that. Great selection of automotives, home hardware. Toys they have but usually out of stock. Good selection of dvd's. Blu rays small section very little. 4k smaller but the ones you do find some are cheaper. Store is clean and is always busy but still you can get in and out depending on the day. Lighting is good. Wheel hair accesible yes. Outside and inside garden area is good size but there's always freight out there blcoking half the outside garden. But there's a home depot right in front of Wal-Mart to purchase your garden needs. Any other questions feel free to ASk. Oh yes they have a busy return area and also a money center for your needs.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Store is usually messy and dusty. Shelves have gaping holes where stock has run out. Unfortunately, not a Super Center, so very little produce and grocery (the candy section is bigger than the produce section and has about ten times the variety). Staff seems completely uninterested in offering actual customer service. There are a few employees that seem to enjoy working there and do try, but for the most part, I feel like I'm interrupting their employees-only social club if I ask for help. I get it - it's probably a crappy place to work and the employees probably have to deal with a lot of horrible, rude customers. I don't expect too much from any Walmart staff, but this particular location is a bit worse than many other Walmart locations I've been to.< /review>

<review>Place is super dirty and the employees were not helpful at all. They huff and puff when you ask where something was or would flat out ignore you and keep walking. Most of the shelves were bare and not stocked so pretty much out of everything. I hate having to go to this Wal-Mart and am probably just going to pay the higher prices at lucky or drive farther to a different Wal-Mart where the people are a little friendlier.<//review><response>None< /response>< rating>

The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life! If you ever order from Walmart online, save yourself the hassle and pick it up from a different store! We found a boat cover online for a great deal so we decided to go into this Martinez Walmart to buy it. When we got there, they had the exact same boat cover on the shelves but they told us we could not receive the price listed online unless we submitted the order online. So we used their computer to place the order, and they told us it would just take a little while for it to go into the system because that is store policy. I kid you not, we ended up sitting there for an hour waiting. Finally we asked if our order was showing up on their system yet and they said that it would take several days to get into the system. They said the only way for us to be able to take home a boat cover today was if we bought another one at the regular in-store price right then and there. We ended up buying two boat cover that day!! But they assured us that we could go in and return it when the online ordered boat cover arrived. If that wasn't bad enough, things kept going downhill I went in to pick up the one I ordered online. My mom was the one who completed the online order but she was really sick so she sent me to pick it up because it was the last day before they were going to send the item back to the factory. She printed out the confirmation email that had all the order details saying to just bring in that paper to pick up the order from the store. When I got there, my order was sitting right there in the store but they could not give it to me because my first name is not my mother's name. I told them that my mom was sick and couldn't come in and that I could call her and she could confirm that she authorized me to pick up the boat cover. They said that's against policy and that she would have to come in or add my name to the order pick up online and it would take a week for my name to get into their system. I asked the associate for the steps to add my name online and she said she knew it was possible but she didn't know how to do it exactly. So she called her manager and the manager did not know how to do it either. If they do not know how to do it, then how do they expect customers to know?! Finally the manager told me he could hold it for a week longer, but he failed to take down my name, my order number, etc. IGNORANCE! The abundance of these kinds of ignorant people working for such a huge company have the potential of killing it's reputation and eventually even ruining the entire company! Anyways, save yourself a headache and go to a different Walmart even if it is a little further away.</review>

Terrible customer service. We asked for a price check on a treadmill because it's too heavy to carry to a price scanner and the gentleman helping us was extremely rude and had a ton of attitude. We just wanted to know the damn price. Super rude..but what do u expect from walmart<//Review>

Wal-Mart Martinez is one of the most clean and pleasant experiences compared to any local Wal-Mart. The floor plan is easier to navigate and self-checkout makes every trip easy!< /text>

This store is far from clean and the employees that you can find normally need to ask someone else where to look. Don't go when it's busy because they never have enough checkers.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><username>Peter Jenson</username><Review>This store is the most poorly managed and poorly run place I have ever been in. I have been to this Martinez store location on several occasions to find products that are supposed to be in stock and on the shelf. On every occasion the store is out of stock on items that should have been on the shelf. Walmart Martinez and Walmart in general has a serious logistics problem. If you are counting on product being on the shelf just forget about Walmart and this store. Management is a disaster at this location and I think this is indicative of greater management problems at Walmart everywhere. I get depressed and frustrated when I am in Walmart - the reason I avoid this place as much as possible.</Review>< GmapID>

This Walmart is usually pretty busy but what Walmart isn't?! There are a couple of things that I dislike about this place. #1 the parking lot is usually a nightmare. #2 the store is not as clean and well put together as I think it should be. Many times I see employees just wandering around without really doing anything while there are many items that seem to be out of place. Try not to go here unless I absolutely have to.<//Text>

I try to call ahead to make sure Walmart has the item I need.  Their call center (Martinez) is the
worse experience to go through.  I'm normally on hold for 15-20 Mins or get hung up on. I can
usually drive there and check myself before they come back to the phone......UGH
I was just on hold with the third person I got switched to after 10 mins he did come back. Surprise
surprise.

Always super packed.  Crowded parking (horrible parkers too) But it's a close Wal-Mart to my home, so I love it here. Prices are low (like all Wal-marts) and the place keeps pretty clean. Share's a parking lot with Home Depot, and a small strip of stores towards the back.

Bring your own Bags, or be prepared to pay for bags.  Contra Costa County is one of the few that has started enforcing the law.</Review>

< Review>
I went to the customer service counter in Martinez to return some portable/ heaters radiator heaters. The experience was extremely Pleasant , very very quick and painless, unlike the Walmart customer service in Antioch. That customer service is horrid, horribly long, painful and absolutely ridiculous!!!  The service is never sufficient enough, the lines are always out the door as if they are giving something away for free. It's  just the opposite at the Martinez Wal-Mart.  I walked in there was only one gentleman ahead of me and the young lady helped him very quickly.  Then I was next, she dealt with me very quickly, very politely, and I was on my way out the door, which is exactly why I chose to go to this particular Walmart, so that I didn't have to suffer the agonizing death of waiting in line Forever at the Antioch Walmart not to mention possibly getting there only to find out that the customer service may be closed anyway.  So any which way you look at it don't ever return anything at the Antioch Walmart please choose another Walmart as your first option and the Martinez location was fabulous. And to just add it is always clean and they always have what you're looking for there always plenty stocked and they even have things that the Antioch and Pittsburg Walmart do not have.<//Review>

I'm not sure why in Cali they make you pay for your plastic bags... But it's a load of BS and they don't have a bakery or deli which was reallu odd. The employees don't really know where anything is either.<//Review>

<name>Cecile Hasselbrink</name><Date>1374007101119< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I had another bad experience with Walmart Martinez.  I'm all for helping the challenged people have jobs, but the clerk who finally appeared in Site to Store pickup was incompetent.  My name had been entered incorrectly on the order (I still don't know how - but I spent a long time trying to show her my copy of the order, my credit card, my (then out of state) driver's license and explain to her that a name entered as "Cecile Cecile Has" (space runs out on the name box) was really Cecile Hasselbrink.  The address and the phone number were correct on the order.  When she finally got the manager about 15 minutes later, the manager realized immediately what had happened which was obvious to me, a second clerk who had come by while I was talking with the original clerk, and her but the original clerk couldn't get it. She had also told me that they couldn't fill the Pur water filter part of the order---but I found it on the shelf.

Then, probably at her manager's suggestion, decided to be helpful in getting the large screen TV (the first item of the order) to my car.  I guess you need to always deal with a manager out there.  I am now ordering a lot of stuff online  from Walmart that has free delivery---which works great< /Text>< pics>

<review>Laziest bunch of employees I have ever had the misfortune to experience! I went to exchange a pair of scrub pants for a bigger size, the return lady Dee was so rude and unhelpful. The night manager Taxianna refused to exchange the pants because the bar code wasn't onfile, even though I went back and found the exact brand and size. The employees are totally unprofessional and argumentative.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I've shopped in Walmart stores for years, but the Martinez store is not a favorite.  It seems like every time I go there, their shelves are half stocked.  Sure, they carry what I need, just not today.  It's gotten so I'd rather go somewhere else, and pay a little more than to waste a trip to Walmart only to be disappointed because they're out of what I need.<//Review></record>

I had another bad experience with Walmart Martinez.  I'm all for helping the challenged people have jobs, but the clerk who finally appeared in Site to Store pickup was incompetent.  My name had been entered incorrectly on the order (I still don't know how - but I spent a long time trying to show her my copy of the order, my credit card, my (then out of state) driver's license and explain to her that a name entered as "Cecile Cecile Has" (space runs out on the name box) was really Cecile Hasselbrink.  The address and the phone number were correct on the order.  When she finally got the manager about 15 minutes later, the manager realized immediately what had happened which was obvious to me, a second clerk who had come by while I was talking with the original clerk, and her but the original clerk couldn't get it. She had also told me that they couldn't fill the Pur water filter part of the order---but I found it on the shelf.

Then, probably at her manager's suggestion, decided to be helpful in getting the large screen TV (the first item of the order) to my car.  I guess you need to always deal with a manager out there.  I am now ordering a lot of stuff online  from Walmart that has free delivery---which works great< /text>

Everyone that works here is an idiot. No one knows anything and don't waste your time calling in to inquire about any products. According to Nick at Electronics, there are no supervisors or managers on duty. Horrible customer service!< /Review>

The worst walmart from midwest to the west. Never stacked, you have to dig though the product to find what u looking for. Some items misplaced or labeld wrong. Never will shop here again, better off driving to pittsburg or concord<//Text>

Average Walmart with below average selection. You'll find basic things missing like an ice pack for example. More crowded than other Walmarts.</review>

<Review>Only thing I don't like each time I go to Walmart is the line !  There's only one line you can buy alcohol/smokes in & seems like that's where they put there slowest checkers, I also think that line should be 10 items or less.<//Review><time>1505610480385<//time><name>Shelly Nield< /name><gmap_id>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69</gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>4</Rate><userid>104533585561162389454< /userid><resp>None< /resp></record>

< Review>
It's a Walmart. The people that work there are people.  They have this 'read the receipt' policy, similar to Fry's Electronics, but the people never actually look to see if that's what you have-- unless they think you look like a shoplifter. (I've seen them pull folks to the side) I think it's kinda lame to have a receipt policy, if you have no intention of actually doing what the policy is supposed to do. Otherwise, it's a typical Walmart.<//Review>

Place never has what I need. Even early in the morning the place is NOT well stocked. Seems the employees have time to socialize with each other but can't stock shelves or check customers out in a timely fashion. Must be the welfare to work group.</Text>

I dislike Walmart in general, this one is no different.  Dirty place and people.  The ONLY reason I go here is if I do not have time or I know Walmart has the cheapest price.<//text>

I will only go to Walmart if "I have to". Unfortunately, I had to in this case. As always, Walmart is always disgusting, full of long lines and clutter. I dislike coming to Walmart because of this and especially this Walmart is dirty.<//Text>

Don't give the employee's a hard time as they are doing the best they can and are hard pressed to get everything done in a timely manner.

Just like Safeway on $5.00 Friday with only one person in the Delhi...lol</Review>< Pics>

Deserves zero stars. The employees are NOT helpful and do the least amount of work possible to get by.
Don’t bother calling to ask if a product is in stock - the lady at customer service will just say no she won’t go look and then leave you on hold for the rest of the day.
I will never shop at this location again. And I hope that lady working customer service today gets fired because she’s everything that is wrong about the customer service field.

<review>(Translated by Google) All large supermarket chains adopt low-price management strategies. The difference between Wal-Mart is that it tries its best to save money in terms of purchase channels, distribution methods, marketing expenses, and administrative expenses. "As one" slogan, and strive to achieve the promise of cheaper prices than other companies. Strict purchasing attitude, perfect delivery system and advanced inventory management are the key factors for Wal-Mart to achieve the lowest cost and cheapest price. In the retail industry, a comfortable shopping environment and high-quality and thoughtful service are inevitably linked to higher prices; while in chain supermarkets with low commodity prices, customers often only get discounts on shopping prices, rather than high-quality products. service. K-Mart (K-Mart) is a well-known large discount chain store in the United States. It has a large number of stores. In order to save labor costs, there are few staff. Although the store displays a wide variety of low-priced goods, it is not easy for customers to find one or two clerk to ask questions. Here, although the customers satisfied their desire to buy cheap goods, they did not feel that the clerk paid little attention to them, so they regretted that they were not perfect.

所有的大型连锁超市都采取低价经营策略，沃尔玛与众不同之处在于，它想尽一切办法从进货渠道、分销方式以及营销费用、行政开支等各方面节省资金，提出了“天天平价、始终如一”的口号，并努力实现价格比其它商号更便宜的承诺。严谨的采购态度，完善的发货系统和先进的存货管理是促成沃尔玛做到成本最低、价格最便宜的关键因素。在零售业中，舒适的购物环境、优质周到的服务必然与较高的价格相联系；而在商品价格低廉的连锁超市中，顾客往往只能得到购物价格上的优惠，而无法享受到优质的服务。凯马特（K—Mart）是美国一间著名的大型折扣连锁店，它的卖场广大，为了节约人工成本，店员却很少。虽然店里陈列着品种繁多、价格便宜的商品，但顾客如想找一、两位店员询问有关问题却不是件容易的事。在这里，顾客虽然满足了购买便宜商品的欲望，但是没有感觉到店员对他们付出了一点点关心，于是在顾客心中就产生了美中不足的遗憾。<//review>< pics>
