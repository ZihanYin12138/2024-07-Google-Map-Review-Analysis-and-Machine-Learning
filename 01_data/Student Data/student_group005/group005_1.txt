< review>
I came to Javier Rios by referral on the worst day of my life.  Over the course of our relationship Javier provided top quality legal care and extremely valuable emotional support.  He was knowledgeable, responsive, and supportive.  In addition to covering all aspects of my case legally, he prepared me for all of the potential outcomes and helped me develop a plan for each possibility.  Finally, at the conclusion of my case, he provided valuable insight into tools to help me better manage my life going forward.  With his help, I will never need his services again.  And I mean that as the highest compliment.  I would recommend Javier Rios to anyone seeking legal assistance.< /review>

<review>Javier was very professional from day one. He outlined the possible scenarios and advised me the best course of actions based on my situation. He was always available when I needed clarifications or additional resources. Javier is a kind and respectful lawyer. I cannot thank him enough and would highly recommend his service.

<text>Javier was hired on my case in 2020. He is very knowledgeable about all kinds of situations of Domestic Violence cases so that he gives me very clear instructions to gather paperwork and resources.
Javier is very responsive. He always responded immediately to either my text, calls or email and was proactive in helping me get my case resolved. He was able to get details from the court for me that helped move my case along faster than I would have done myself. He informed every step of the way until the task was completed. Our communication was always smooth and professional. Eventually my case was not file charged! I was so exited about the result!
I would definitely recommend the individual that needs help with their legal issues to use Mr. Javier! He is also bi-language that can speak Spanish very well.
Thank you so much for your support! Hope you all the best.</text>< rate>

During these times “pandemic” it can be tough for others to enjoy. So having an important person like Mr. Rios by your side is very encouraging& helpful. He’s very engaging and informative in all topics about the law. He’s also straight forward and right to the point. Nothing but the best recommendation that anyone can ask for and won’t be disappointed having him to represent you.< /Text>

Above and beyond, and exceptional is a great description. I did nowhere near expect the level of engagement, professionalism and responsiveness I received from Mr. Rios. I hope to never need the services again, but if I ever do Mr. Rios will always be my first choice. Thank you for everything you have done!! I recommend you and your exceptional services to anyone.< /Review>

I secured a huge victory in my domestic violence case, all because of Javier's excellent work. For my case initially I worked with a lawyer who tried to rob me bailout fees where in fact I was released without a bail. After that I did a lot of research online and was fortunate to have chosen Javier as my lawyer. Javier is very responsive, transparent, and provides me every pieces of information I need in order to make informed decisions.< /text>

Mr. Rios responded at 9PM after maybe an hour (max) for a complex criminal case. He was incredibly knowledgable and self sacrificing as he recommended alternative counsel based on jurisdiction even though your typical attorney would attempt to run with it regardless of there being better alternatives. He is an outstanding attorney that cares more about effective counsel than profit, simply outstanding.< /review>

Javier recently helped me(name changed) with my case and built up a great defense. He was extremely courteous and responsive to all my queries and concerns.

After our initial conversation, he came up with a plan that we followed till the very end.

He was conservatively optimistic, but made sure that I set my expectations correctly.

In the end, it was because of his defense paperwork that the case got dismissed. I cannot be thankful enough for what he has done for me and my family.

God Bless Him!<//review>

Mr. Rios was great from the start. Friendly, professional, and such a great all around man. Easy to contact and would keep my family and I up to date with everything. I appreciated the fact that he went out of his way to help me out with my situation and wasn’t at all bothered to do so. Would highly recommend because of his professionalism and passion to do what he does. Thanks so much Mr. Rios, I’ll be sure to recommend you to the rest of my families and you’ll be the first one we contact if we need anything else!< /Review>

<review>After interviewing many attorneys in the area, my family decided to hire Mr. Rios. We are incredibly grateful that we found him. He was able to get my family member’s charges dismissed. His professionalism, empathy, and passion for defending clients make him a great attorney. What I appreciated most about Mr. Rios was that he always kept our family updated. Unlike other attorneys we’ve worked with in the past, Mr. Rios made sure to touch base after every court hearing and kept us involved throughout the whole process. More importantly, Mr. Rios was also very understanding and kind. My family member’s case was complicated. Mr. Rios made my family member feel at ease talking about a difficult subject. I highly recommend Mr. Rios! He’s a great attorney and the fact that he can speak Spanish is a huge plus. Mr. Rios advocates for clients fiercely and I know his skilled representation made all the difference.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1558483766081, 'text': 'These kind words are very generous.

<Review>We had the privilege of having Javier Rios as our defense criminal attorney. Javier is a very intelligent attorney! Javier provided legal advice and guidance that gave us peace of mind. Javier is not just an attorney but a human being that is very honest and trustworthy! We felt from the beginning that our case was in good hands. Javier presented a plan for our case that succeeded! I would highly recommend Javier Rios to anyone seeking legal representation that is fair and honest!

<Text>Received consultation from Javier and he keep it solid stating that the best deal was provided by the public defender already. It would be a waste to hire an attorney to get basically the same results so he recommended to take the deal offered. He broke it down and listed why the offer would not change even with an attorney. I appreciate Javier keeping it real so we don’t waste time or money. Thank you!< /Text>< response>
{'time': 1567645404274, 'text': "I am glad to have given this person some advice. The fact of the matter is that Santa Clara County has a very fine Public Defender's Office. That office is full of great lawyers. Sometimes, bringing in a new lawyer, just to bring in a new lawyer, will not really change what is going on in the case.  I remember when I was a public defender; many many, many times when the family would hire a private attorney, the offer did not change--- it stayed the same."}</response>

<Review>I am helped by Atty. Rios, 3 months ago. He won my  case, despite it being complicated. He listened well to me and he can easily be reached for any questions. He has a good heart, but so professional. Price was highly reasonable. I thank you for all your help!</Review>< date>

This is just based on a consultation I had over the phone with him. He is very professional very straightforward and doesn't give you the runaround. He even told me not to spend my money on hiring him because my money needed to go towards something a little bit more pressing. Just shows his true character and I appreciate him greatly.</review>

I met Javier Rios through San Jose Christian School and called on him for some legal help. Mr. Rios was helpful, knowledgeable, professional and was able to be a strong advocate for us. Javier impressed us in that he was efficient yet thorough and is honest about the progress he can make on your behalf. I will call Javier  anytime I have a legal problem and would highly recommend him to everyone.</Text>

<text>My family needed an experienced attorney for a case. We looked allover and wound up calling Javier Rios. It was a stroke of good luck for us. We hired him and he did a great job. I do not want to discuss the facts of the case. But I can say that Mr. Rios got us a fine result. He explained the process, answered our questions. He works hard and loves his work. You can tell when someone loves their work. If we need a criminal lawyer again, Jav is the person we will call.</text>< response>

< Review>
No other attorney will care for not only your life and well being, but he will go the extra 5 steps and periodically check in with your immediate family to reassure them and comfort them. He is the most professional and extremely skilled man for the job that will not leave anything unseen. I owe him more than a simple review, Javier Rios saved my future life from suffering.

Much love, Chris.<//Review>

A dear relative of mine was falsely accused of child molest. Javier Rios took on the case. He got the case dismissed. Javier is not cheap; but he is the best at what he does. I saw him in the courtroom and he is very, very good. He prepares. He knows the courts and the law. My family will always be grateful to Javier. Thank you so much Mr. Rios.<//Review>

<review>One of the best guys out there. He genuinely cares for his clients and helps them with 150% effort. It's hard to find decent attorneys in the area much less those that are willing to go to bat for the little guy. He is worth every penny, nickel, dime you posses and will never do you wrong.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1512280391827, 'text': 'Thanks Mo Kh.--Jav'}< /resp><gmapID>0x808fcb6eedf816b1:0x6bf2e9026fa70602< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Mr. Rios was such a blessing to me and my entire family! He was so dedicated  the entire time and I knew I was in good hands. I would recommend him to anyone that wants a hard working, Caring, smart, AMAZING attorney! I can't say enough good things about this man! Thank you, Javier for helping me get the best possible outcome at court! You are the reason I am free to raise my beautiful son instead of being behind bars!<//text>

<review>I want to express my appreciation for Mr Rios taking the time out to explain judical responsibility and due process of the law. It helped to establish trust and confidence in the system. And demonstrated his experience and skill by articulating in such a clear and concise manner.
I would recommend him to anyone who needs  criminal defense.

This guy is unstoppable! Javier fights long and hard for his clients. Javier got me a 1 year sentence after another lawyer told me that I was lookin at a  life sentence. Javier is a pro.  I never once felt Javier was making any decisions for me. I always felt in control and  properly advised at all times. Javier always allowed me to make my own decisions.  Javier was always calm and sharply dressed for court.  In nearly a dozen court appearances with Javier, he was never late not once. If you value your life and your future...  Hire Javier Rios,  Criminal Defense Attorney.  30 years industry king!< /Text>

I give my lawyer 5 stars. Mr. Rios did nice job for us. We needed good lawyer and he was top lawyer for us. I hope I never need criminal lawyer again. But if we do, I know who to call. This guy is the best. He is so nice too. He cared about me and it showed. I like this guy. Call him too. If you get into trouble.</Review>

My family & I are from SoCal and needed to be represented in court in San Jose.  Mr. Rios was recommended as being honest and that he would not "gouge' us ($$).  Upon meeting him, in his office, I was impressed by his quick concise responses to our questions.  His honesty was obvious.  He let us know up front, what to expect in court and what his short tern and/or long term fees would be.
Our criminal court appearances were handled by him in the briefest time-frame possible.  He was able to have the (felony) charges dismissed.  I am so grateful to have used Javier Rios.  His handling of our case was remarkable.  If the need were to arise again (and I hope it does not), I would definitely seek out Mr. Rios again.< /text>

Javier Rios spoke with me and he quickly answered my questions his many years of experiense showed. My family is not from around here and it can be hard to find a lawyer when u are looking on the internet. His reviews are so good I called him. I am glad I did. He was very patient and is a nice guy too.</Review>

I had a pretty big case when I first walked in. Javier and I discussed everything. While waiting for my next court date, mind you, I was out on $150k Bail, well I got rearrested for a whole differnt charge. This time, bail was revoked, I was locked up. While having been in jail for over 2 months, I was hit with another couple of charges.. LONG STORY!!! So with my first case being complicated, I added 2 more complicated cases to Javier's load. I was looking at a minimum of 10 years in prison. I told Mr Rios, you need to do everything in your power to help me. What started out with 10 fellony charges and 4 strikeable charges, by the grace of God and Mr Rios I walked out of elm wood 8 months later with 5 felonies and 1 strike. I made this guy work his A** off!! This Is a long review, but people need to know,  that Javier Rios is an AMAZING lawyer.< /review><time>1551158032754< /time>< name>

I posted bail and yada, yada, yada, I was scared out of my mind. Someone recommended Javier Rios, said he was a great lawyer, personable and boyscout honest. So I called him immediately within 2 days of my arrest. He got to work fast and gave us a plan. Well, the DA did not file charges. I thank Javier for helping me out of a jam. Amen to that.</review>< pics>

From the start, you are directed to review shop policy and provide documentation via an app.  Again when in the shop.  Hygiene is of the utmost importance down to arm shields, gloves, glasses and aprons.  The artist takes the time to speak with the customer to understand the vision of the tatoo.  You even get aftercare instructions emailed to you so you know how to care for your body art.  I had visited other shops and told me that I would have to do severely bold lines and watercolor was something that would have to be done by an artist that specializes in it.  I found this shop on Yelp and fell in love with the designs I saw.   The reviews are pretty stellar and so I set myself up.  The conversation I had with Tiffany blew me away at just how much she has had to preserve during her life as a tattoo artist.   Will definitely come back if I ever decide on another tatoo.  Best of luck.< /review>< rating>

Kayo RoCKs!!! He's a mellow guy that knows what he's doing! Very pleased with my new tat of a small, geometric line drawing. Anyone less skilled could surely have mucked it up! He was great about taking the time to get the artwork, sizing & positioning just right. The whole process was comfortable & easy-going.

The shop is very clean, open & welcoming. Christie at the front desk, and everyone there is very friendly... a good vibe about the place. A great experience was had by all, and I'd definitely recommend Kayo and this shop to anyone in the market for a tattoo. I picked his portfolio because of the clean line work, and he came through with flying colours!</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This place is awesome. The owner designed it by herself, she is a fabulous artist. There are many details inside, all pure art. You can expend hours looking the store design and decoration. Bumper (a freaking genius) was the artist in charge of my tattoo. I gave him the idea, and he interpreted perfectly well. He surpasses my expectations. My tattoo has a 3D effect. This Spartan is coming out of my own flesh and blood. Thank you Bumper, you did an excellent job!!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I was lucky to get in on a Saturday for a walk in. Christy was extremely sweet and helpful when my husband called the shop to see if any artist was available for a walk in. Kayo was my tattoo artist and OMG he so exceeded my expectation on the palm trees I wanted. He took his time and definitely did some awesome detail work. Pricing was also amazing compared to the other prices I was getting. I would definitely come back to this shop for other work. Everybody was super nice!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I love this shop!! Awesome decor, especially if you love horror movies! Every employee is so friendly and is willing to help. The owner Tiffany is a doll, I have several works of her art permanently inked me that I wear proudly. The have the coolest thing....if you're interested in getting a tattoo for under $100 they have bubble gum machines that are labeled "you get what you get", what you get after putting in your coin is what you get tattooed! I'd feel comfortable walking in and getting a tattoo by anyone available at this shop. Walks in are welcomed but you can also make an appointment.< /text>

This is the best tattoo experience I've ever had, and I'm not new to tattoos. The shop is the coolest business I've ever been in. I would totally move in (there's chocolate and good music too...shhh!). Tiffany drew up exactly what I wanted. Her work is definitely some of the best I've ever seen. She really listened to what I wanted, which was nice. During my appointment she was patient and positive. I had a good size tattoo done and she was good about keeping me focused on the light at the end of the tunnel. She is so fun, but still professional. Everyone I've showed my tattoo to is amazed (and they aren't just being polite). She will be the only one I go to now. Shops and artists like this are next to impossible to find.  -Cole's Mom</review>

Not only has she been tattooing for over 20yrs. She finds the cutest town to put a tattoo shop in! Shop is big and spacious. All of the artists are experienced and talented. The area is super cute. Parking is free. If you find extra time go for a walk! Restaurants, coffee shops, clothing stores. This area has it all! I have been getting tattooed by Tiffany Garcia for years and I am so happy to come to Torrence to do so! The shop is super easy to find. Can't wait to go back in for another tattoo!<//Text>< Rating>

Ok. So this place has been a shining light in my life. I moved here in 2013 and the 1st time I went into that store was something unreal. To this day I purchase such magical and amazing pieces. I LOVE THIS BUSINESS. 🌌

Here are my Mother's Day gifts I received from there. *blessed be< /review>

Clean, well organized, and well stocked. When you walk in, you're greeted by friendly staff and the wonderful smell of incense. Very inviting and comforting atmosphere. Everything catches your eye, so make sure you have the time to explore it all.< /review>

They get just as much business as the 7-Eleven across the street. This place is amazing great quality items at top-notch low pricing. * unlike Bliss crystals = bad energy*< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The energy as soon as you walk in is always positive and inspiring. We have been coming here for years and absolutely love it! James is a sweetheart and he’s always helped us find what we need!

They have a great selection of crystals, metaphysical/esoteric books, candles, herbs, incense, smudging accessories, etc.  I absolutely love how they have something for every interest from all around the world and every continent. From Africa and Asia, to Celtic and Native American.

Excellent variety and selection. Location is great as well! Just off the 15 and Winchester.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I was pretty excited to visit this store since I’ve heard they have a pretty good selection of things. As soon as I walked in the energy felt... off. I tried to brush it off and began picking out some stones for my collection. There was an old-er, heavier set man with long hair walking around. The store smelled like rotten eggs and fart bombs. Not sure if they turned off the lights but the lights went off on the south side of the store. I felt eyes on me and I looked up to find creepy guy staring at me. Even as I was checking out to pay, creepy old guy was staring and I could feel the weird energy coming from that direction. The energy there is strange and dark. I prefer going to blissful crystals. I hope this person isn’t the owner because I would like to come back but not with this creepy guy in the store.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I experienced my first Astral Projection (OBE) and it completely shattered my reality and got me interested in energy and intentions which led me to Lady of the Lake. 2 people there who helped me,  Mike with the legit beard who listened to my OBE story and recommended certain stones and Ana,  who just started working there helped me with my bracelet and necklace. She was cool funny and had very good vibes. Later that day, i was feeling great and decided to go gambling and won 500 bucks. Im not saying to go gamble but I was feeling good because of my experience at Lady of the Lake. Highly recommended<//Review>< Pictures>

Love this place.
They have all of your mystical needs covered.
Plenty to choose from like crystals, oils, incense and sage. Lots of interesting books as well. Great place to get a gift for that person that's hard to buy for.</Text>

The staff is amazing and kind. Very good at remembering returning faces. And makes things easier to find. They're always making their guests feel welcomed and at home. Even in the pandemic they do all they can to keep you and their staff safe and their environment both clean and fun.<//text>< Time>

I've come here since I was a teen and recently visited when back in town. They had a few items at surprisingly good prices (had to double check bc I didn't believe it!). If you're trying to find a gift for the alternative spirituality folks in your life this is a good place to go in and ask questions to find something practical or beautiful or both. It's fun to look at all the books and gifts if you have time to browse. This place was always a metaphysical supply staple in the area. I have never felt uncomfortable being kind of non-alternative-ish in the store - they are respectful and helpful regardless of how you look. Fun selection of incense and candles and symbolic jewelry. Lots of books.</review>

Lots of jewelry as well. They do have just about anything from every religious or philosophy stand point as well. Every time I've gone, there is psychic doing readings.

<Review>This has been one of the greatest stores I’ve had in my life!! This store has been In Temecula since I was a child. The major impact the owners of this store have had on my Spiritual Journey thus far is immeasurable. Had I not been offered the unique tools to grow and learn about my own unique gifts and understanding, I’m not sure I would have evolved to where I am today. The staff has always been pleasant, professional, insightful, and informative. Gratitude to the owners, psychics and the long standing management for all you have done for the community and visitors of Temecula Ca.

Sincerely,
Rain<//Review><time>1571129201224<//time></record>

I love this place. It's nice to be able to enjoy the small things of the magical, mystical, and fantasy. It's a great vibe and energy.
Great for finding unique gifts.<//Review>

I was pleasantly surprised when my sister brought me to this store. She knows I love exploring New Age stores when I travel, because the closest store to where I live is Atlanta.

This store has a wide selection of goods, from jewelry, tarot cards, books, candles, hygiene products, and more. The store associates were very friendly, which was nice because some stores I've been to they are either pushy or plain rude and domineering. So, to be able to not be hassled but have someone there when I have questions is a breath of fresh air.

We spent a while in there browsing through everything and I would love to come back the next time I make it to the West Coast. 💖<//review>

I have been shopping here for years and years. I think this place has been around since I lived in temecula and I moved out here 20+ years ago. Everyone is friendly and good prices. I am so glad temecula has this kinda store because there is not another one around.</Text>

And I like the store, I must say the customer service I was not impressed with. Felt like I was being ignored when the time came for me to check out I had to say something after standing waiting at the counter for about ten minutes or so. I hope they work on the customer service in the future.</text></record></dataset><record>

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. It was so nicely laid out with place cards explaining what things were and their metaphysical properties. They are very reasonably priced and staff was very friendly. The (male) owner was a bit gruff but I will chalk that up to a bad day but the long haired brunette was so pleasant n amazing it didn't matter. Most of their jewelry was a bit overpriced BUT I have seen higher prices around the area. They have a great selection of incense, oils, books, cards, candles and clothing. I did not get a reading but I did see the reader they had the day I visited and she may be great for card readings.. I ABSOLUTELY recommend this shop for metaphysical needs n supplies, tho. I LOVEd this store.</review>

They were nice for the most part, neat place, but the guy behind the counter accused me of something and it was awkward when I refuted his accusation. Please have some evidence before you make customers uncomfortable, guys. Yikes.< /Text>

Great shop with many interesting items you just don't find everywhere.  They have an extensive book selection on all kinds of spiritual and mystical topics.  It's always an adventure going shopping at this store.<//Text>

<review>This is a neat store. They have quite afew things for a beginner  witch. But beware young ones they DO NOT stand behind their products. No returns. Period. I now drive down to Los Angeles. A darling apothecary! You must go. It's called Pan Pipes. Check them out on the web. Also she does stand behind her products!! "Integrity"</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Staff is super friendly and always gives me answers to different questions I've had. I enjoy coming here and buying little trinkets when I'm in the area. The soaps are excellent. They have a huge section of books and tons of interesting items to look at, you could easily spend an hour here without realizing it!<//Review>< resp>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Absolutely wonderful place. I love the expansive collection of spiritual and metaphysical items, metal sculptures, and books. The staff helped and were very patient. I bought bracelets for my girl and some incense from india. They also gave free samples of incense to me on my way out and a discreet bag to put  my stuff into, so if you don't want to be judged for purchasing new age things, no one will know.< /Text>< Pics>

Awesome place for gifts. Books, candles, jewelry, crystals, statues, cards, ...SO many beautiful treasures I can't even begin to tell you. This has been my favorite gift shop in Temecula since before I ever lived here. Their knowledgeable and friendly staff are wonderful people. They have been open for over 20 years 💝♥💛💚💙💜<//text>

If you want to shop where they treat you as if they ar doing you a favor to shop at their store welll this Management is it.  I asked for something that they did not have 3-4 weeks ago.  I live in the San Fernando Valley and out of nowhere I received a call today that the tarot cards are in.  They can only hold them until the end of today and itia already 3:30pm.  Now, tell me?  Do I own a helicopter?  Give a couple of days notice at least.  They never gave me an approximate time when they would even try to order the cards.   This is totally unexpected on my behalf.  So, I guess I need to drive my SUV in traffic and put $100 in the tank and forget about picking up my kids from school because the Tarot Cards are here today?!!!  They never would have had these if I didn't ask about a particular brand.  If they are that thirsty I don't want the cards.  They will have bad Ju-ju on them anyway.  This is an alleged Spiritual Store.  This guy must think it's Neiman Marcus.  I called the Green Man Store in North Hollywood and they said they would glady hold the cards for a couple of days and it was no big deal.  And their Smudging Feathers were $5 instead of $28.  That's where I will spend my money.  Bye Lady of the Funky Lake.</text>

Hidden gem for tennis and soccer players. Secluded and hidden from public this playground offers two lit courts usually with little wait time. Courts are in mint condition, must have been recently renovated. Soccer field is big along with adjacent basketball courts.<//Text>

Great playground in the heart of the city. It has a family friendly restroom next door, and plenty of play equipment, or soccer fields for your kid(s) to play on. I'm giving a 4 star review because of the gross city streets needed to get there and transients who sometimes show up nearby, otherwise would totally be a 5 star.<//text>

There is a pretty boring park in the front but in the back there is a pretty interesting park. The only problem is that the interesting park is hard to notice if you don't look around a lot.<//review>

Park is alright. Public pool facilities w seperate bathrooms. Seperate from park. Bball court, 2 tennis courts, large artificial soccer pitch, xlarge sand play area and seperate water-works play area. No open grassy play fields, but the public restrooms are maintained. Overall small, but nice.< /Text>

A small collection of cool, kinetic play equipment keeps kids and their adults entertained. There is a nice soccer field nearby. Nice break in a great walkable neighborhood full of things to do.< /Text>

<review>Their meat is the best in town for sure!
They have almost everything you need.
Great service, Robert is very helpful and his gorgeous son is unfailingly courteous and helpful.

Everything sugary. Don't know anything about organic. Has mainly expired food and likes to be either cheap or lazy and keep the frozen products and tortillas way past the 'best by' date.  Double check your stuff.< /text>

<review>Went here because the way the old 1960s structure looked and I like hole in the wall places.  Simple menu only burritos and tacos, but a little too simple. Great potential but too old school for me.  Burritos were dry and absolutely no cheese on the premises which is the most important part.  If they get cheese and offer quesadillas I’ll try it.  Terrible bland watery hot sauce and they would not give more than a few per burrito.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I got carne asada tacos. The meat lacked flavor but it was soft and tender. The customer service puts it at 4 stars. The guy that took my order was great and welcoming.</text>

I just got back from Tacos Estilo Guadalajara , I  purchased some tacos and a burrito all of carne asada believe me there good  I'm  really picky about the meat that I eat most taco places have fat on their meats and Tacos Estilo Guadalajara don't  have fat on there Meat.  Also there Hot (red) sauce is very Hot so if you like it Hot this is the place to try out.Thank you Tacos Estilo Guadalajara they were very good!! 👍👍👍</Text>

Had the asada tacos... DELICIOUS!  Got the order to go and the toppings were all wrapped up separately which kept everything fresh.</review>

I asked for al pastor, to my surprise it was going to be another 15 minutes before it was ready!! Ni modo.. I got 6 asada tacos and a jamaica. Then out of the blue while we were eating the asada tacos..the cashier told me the al pastor was ready and gave me an al pastor taco in the house!! Not only are their tacos the best in town..but the customer service is outstanding!! Great job 👍👌 y'all must check out the habanero salsa🔥🔥👌👌. Gracias Raza!!< /review>< Pictures>

We went there twice last weekend!  Both times we got the best super burger, cooked to our expectations and the best servers!  I loved our server, Juan, and I can't remember the girl's name - she was just extremely nice, too!  Good welcome experience!  It all went wonderful.  We love diners and we look forward to going there many many times more!  Thanks for the good service and quality of food! That is a great feeling!</text>

Great service in a retro environment. Burgers and shakes are great. Endless fries are delicious as long as you are not watching your calories 🙂.  Seasonal shakes can be a great find too especially in December.< /Review>

My party was seated and we waited 15+ minutes to be helped. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and I received water with black strawberries inside. I ordered a BLTA which was good, although the bacon was undercooked and extremely fatty, the avocado was brown and half of the sandwich was lettuce. Another person in my party ordered a Turkey Breast Sandwich and fries. Unfortunately, there was several long, black hairs under them. Overall, staff was non-responsive and the food was not so good. I was expecting more from such a great chain of diners.< /text>< Name>

I'm a bit weirded out by the 70s theme. The 50s theme was much better. Otherwise they have good burgers and great shakes.</text>

A classic.  This is the only place that knows how to make a turkey burger taste like a regular burger.  Love it here.  Park underground in the mall near the AMC to find this place.<//Text>

Ok so we waited for 10 minutes for a table which isn't bad but the problem I have is we sat while 5-6 tables that came in after us were sat. I asked the girl if we were still on the list and got nothing but attitude. I hope it gets better from here.<//Review>

I've been renting for a while at this location. After a couple of months passed I noticed some odd things with my stored and Locked up items.. didn't think much of it till one day things went missing and it was clear that someone had been going into my storage unit.. I dont know who but I have my suspicions about management. Would definitely not recommend this place.<//review>

Have been a customer for many years. The girls that work there are very helpful and outgoing. I recommend in renting there because they know what they do and they keep the property clean. The best part is having easy access to my unit because it is a drive up. They are keeping up with the technology because I am able to open the gate through an app on my phone. I'm a very happy tenant :)</review>

<Text>I received outstanding customer service from Rosa!

As someone who works in customer service I understand the tough positions you can be put in sometimes. Having to bend over backwards to fulfill a customer's needs can be daunting, but that is the kind of amazing customer service I received.

Recently I had to move a lot of my belongings due to the COVID situation. I had called around to other storage places but didn't quite feel that they met my needs, and some of them weren't very helpful. However, as soon as I got on the phone with Rosa, I knew I had found the right place.

Rosa was super empathetic and helpful; taking the measurements I gave her, she found me the right size storage unit and provided helpful knowledge of the area and directions.

I don't usually post reviews on here, but I was moved by the experience and needed to get my thoughts out, even though I am a bit late.

Thank you Rosa!

I will definitely be a returning customer :)<//Text>< date>

Received outstanding service from Adriana today!

I called to check on truck parking availability and cost.  Adriana explained that she did not have a space currently available. But she promised to look for spaces at associated stores and to call me back.

And she did just that.  This may not be a big thing for some folks.  But I appreciate it when customer service staff follow-through on their promises.

The data she reported was accurate.  I know because I called some of the same properties she did and got the same price quotes.

I rent from this storage company in a couple locations including this one. What not to like about this place? Easy access to 91 and 57 freeways. Prices for this location are fair. Facility is safe and clean. And the managers on site are always friendly, helpful, and always seem to be smiling. Cant beat that.< /text>

<review>I was shopping around the area for some prices and of course convenience. I found Storage Etc to be very close to where I work, so I checked it out and the ladies in the office showed me around and figured out what size I needed (I was just storing some tools). The hours of access totally worked for me, much better than other places around the area, and it was very convenient to me because I park right next to my unit and it's not a hassle to load up my tools into my truck. I feel very comfortable to be storing with them.<//review>< gmap_id>

Shopped around the area and decided to go with this facility only because price was right for me and there’s no lousy stairs or elevators. Everything is ground level and well maintained. I also have access from early morning to late night which works great for me! In other words if you’re looking for a great storage place, this is the one!< /text>

I have rented spaces on second level before in another storage property, but this just made it a lot easier to access.

Great experience here.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>I am shopping for future storage and I stopped by facility to see what they offer. One of my concerns is safety and I noticed that this facility is very secured and has 24hr surveillance and cameras throughout the property. I also liked the access and gate hours. The place is very well kept and employees are very nice. I am definitely renting from them this coming month< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I rented a unit from this place a couple months ago. I rented here because of the easy access. Place was very clean and noticed that they have surveillance cameras running 24/7. Gate hours are good, and prices are affordable and competitive. Staff is very friendly. I would definitely rent with them in the future.< /Text>

I have found the staff to be very positive and helpful, I pay my payments mostly by walking into the office and I am always greeted with a smile and very positive interaction. I feel like they truly make me feel like a part of the family. I would recommend this location to friends and family members that need a place to store household items. The rates are reasonable for the size the unit needed.< /text>

< review>
I was in the market for a storage facility with quality service. Storage etc. of Anaheim was just the outfit for me, I had to look no further.  A lot of people say that you just can’t get first class treatment in a business these days.  There wrong, and Storage etc. of Anaheim’s management team proves it.
I want to personally thank Asst. Mang. Damaris Arroyo for the extra time and personal courtesy that you provided me.  I greatly appreciate your patience, graciousness, and good advice.  The average individual would not go that extra mile for responding so efficiently to my individual storage needs I was under a time frame and in a pickle. Ms. D. Arroyo’s expedited service saved the day.  Thanks for coming to the rescue.  You can be assured I look forward to working with you in the future.  Without her special attention and professional courtesy I could not have completed my project successfully, let alone on schedule.  Ms. D. Arroyo’s extra effort made all the difference.  Thanks for all your hard work.
Too often people doing business never really communicate on a personal level yet alone offer the best combination of service, product, and price.
Yes I can certainly recommend Storage etc. of Anaheim’s management team for great service.</review>

The two Managers there, Karla and Adriana, are both freaking awesome. The are both very knowledgeable about other competitors' pricing and very patient with my gazillion questions for what kind of unit I needed, spacing, proximity, etc. Their facility is immaculate - always clean, well kept, and everything always seems to be in order. The facility is also right off the 91 so its easy to get to. There was another storage place that had a tad bit lower pricing in the area, but I chose this location because I was already hooked by their amazing personalities, courtesy, and friendliness - alongside all the other stuff like great location, great price, and clean facility. Highly recommended!</Review>

<review>I’ve been a customer at this location since early 2000 when it was Orangethorpe Mini Storage.  It’s been a great improvement since you (Storage Etc) took over a few years ago. New paint looks nice and longer gate hours make it more convenient to get to your unit.    Adriana and Erika are wonderful to deal with in the office or when checking out the grounds, keeping everything clean, neat and safe.  “KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK”<//review>< gmap_id>

Decent storage reasonable rates friendly staff only thing I don't like about it is it's not 24 hours and they close at 9 so if your car is inside the gate after 9 you get stuck<//Review>

I am glad to hear the Managers provided excellent customer service and you got a great unit at a great price. As to the 24-hour access, we have set office and access hours for our facilities. We enforce these hours to ensure the safety and security of both our tenants and their stored items. After these hours, gates will no longer open, so all tenants are required to leave the premises beforehand as listed in the rental agreement. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via private message.\nThank you,\nAmanda'}<//Response></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place to anyone. They opened the lock for me and they stole my things. It is the worst place to rent a space. I hope that what happened to me will not happen to more people and hopefully the company will pay attention 👀👀 "to the managers"

We were looking for a place to stay in the area and called this KOA.  Fatima knew that it was just for a quick overnight (called at 4:15 for a 5:30 arrival). It is 5+ miles of narrow, somewhat twisty roads with some fairly steep hills off the 101.  The sights are set up for utilities on one pole for 2 sites, so one site has to pull all cables, hoses (water and sewer) under their rig to the hook ups.  There is not really a dog area, though there is some areas that you could walk them.  The restrooms are okay.  All of this for a steep overnight total charge of $90+.  This may be a great place for a long stay group camp, etc.  But overnighters, NO.  I do need to mention that there are some pretty views (thanks to the steep hills coming in).</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This is a darling park with super friendly helpful staff.  The pond is so pretty and peaceful. The road to get to it, however, it quite "challenging" for a big rig.  VERY narrow and curvy--1 lane for a short distance.  There is another entrance road that isn't quite as bad but has a bridge with a 13 ton limit--we risked it anyway!</Text>

I grew up in the neighborhood & had fond memories there. Upon check in, Pamela greeted us with a friendly smile, made us feel at home & gave us our site info. We pulled into our space, which was perfect! We enjoyed visiting with camp staff, relaxing at our site, touring the park (even with Covid restrictions) & reminiscing of childhood times - visiting friends, swimming & fishing! Going back soon< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>cute koa rustic with some of the comforts of home.  during the week your pretty much alone relaxing listening to the wildlife fishing at the pond and just enjoying nature.  the weekend brings families with kids mom and dads  teaching the little ones to fish and lots of laughter.  a great place to stay when you want to get away.  PS the road up isn't bad at all unless you've never driven on any curvy roads.</text>< pictures>

<review>The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I do not recommend anyone to come to this camp, especially this time. The health services need to go there and check it out for safeties. Too many people are at the pool with no distance or reservations and that could risk safety for others. There were only 1 bathroom throughout the whole camp that is very far distance from other campsites. The whole campground is extremely dirty.</review>< pictures>

<review>The location is good but the campground in general is quite run down. It only has 2 toilet houses (for thousands of guests) with 3 toilets and 3 showers each, often out of order and dirty. I've seen them "cleaning" and they don't actually clean but refill paper, pick up trash and change bags, which is VERY concerning, especially now during the pandemic. Any space is used for a tent site, and so many sites are by the roads, taking on car exhausts and dust, and are always very loud. There's an old mini-golf that seems to have been destroyed for years, and also a fishing pond to "catch and release", which we found extremely cruel. The shop doesn't have much and is very expensive. Staff were okay. Never again.<//review>< rating>

This was our first time camping at a KOA facility.  We were content with our overall experience.  The location was surrounded by beautiful wineries, which we could see from the porch of our cabin (Kingfisher).  The cabin itself was very spacious and cozy with a swing on the front porch.  There was plenty of space between each cabin, allowing our children to play freely.  Each site was equipped with a covered picnic table, a fire pit, a BBQ pit, and a water spigot–making it easy to travel light.  The bathrooms were clean and had hot water!  The staff was friendly, courteous, and flexible.

The property was in good condition–there were a few improvements that could be made:

1. The swimming pool was not heated as advertised–we could see the solar system, but the pool was freezing.  The pool / spa was clear, but needed to be skimmed and vacuumed.  The pool furniture was weathered.

2. The Put-Put was not maintained and there was a lot of standing water.  There had been a recent storm, so to compensate for the condition they allowed guests to play for free!

3. The cabin was clean, but there were a lot of spider webs, cobwebs, and spider eggs around the beds.  It looked like there's never been dusting between walls and beds.  We understood there would be insects on our trip, but we weren't expecting them to be our roommates.

4. Not much going on during off season.  So, we missed out on movie nights, breakfast, and other activities that are only scheduled during peak-season.

We have already recommended this facility to family and friends.  We look forward to exploring other KOA facilities!< /Text>

Only because I can't give it a 0 rating. With a bit of work this place could be a beautiful place. Superb location. Dirty pool, mini golf is unusable. If it's seasonal, we must be off season. Grass needs a serious cut. KOA used to mean quality.<//text>

Golf was closed, store closed early and staff was very unfriendly and not helpful. I called on the way there to confirm reservation for us and another family that our sites were next to each other, they said we were all set. When we arrived 2hrs later they had given one of the sites to someone else and expected us to stay on opposite sides of the camp. Our friends downgraded to a cabin without a bathroom so we could be next to one another and the kids could play. The staff could care less, no discounts, no apologies just said it wasn't guaranteed.  Will never go back. Go to Petaluma, Monterey or Santa Cruz they are so much better!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Wow! This place was a piece of work.
First of all it’s 15 miles or more off of the freeway with small windy roads. No joke there was a sign on a post towards the end that said “do not despair you are almost there”.

Horrible customer service when making the reservation in the first place as the woman was hurried and basically said we had a site and hung up on us. Then of course when we got there she did not have our reservation.

We had called several times to verify and the phone mailbox was full. No one ever picks up the phone and we couldn’t leave a message.

Then the computers weren’t working so they couldn’t even check us in.

The “full hook ups” are an uneven dirt space with a tire well for a fire ring. Place is kinda a dump especially the showers which were filthy, full of hair and not enough of them for the size of the campground.

I hardly ever leave reviews but had to in this case so buyer beware! Super surprised this can be called a KOA.< /review>

<Review>Only four stars because of the long Winding Road required to reach the destination point, with not a sufficient amount of signs letting us know we're going the right way. But once we were there and we were settled in, it proved to be satisfactory. It was very quiet even though there were a lot of people there. Plenty of room between spaces and campers. But it was a very enjoyable stay< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Wow, what a beautiful, well kept facility.
Cabins, rv hookups, pool, showers, game room, play ground, fishing hole.

Something for everyone.

I would definitely go there again.< /Review>

<review>Love the small town people. Warm and comfortable place.  Bolt material shop has a variety of quilting fabric and classes you can take.  Went to La Hacienda Mexican food restaurant. Food was true Mexican tasting food, very good. Rice  and beans, best I every had. Except  for my moms of course. Salsa and chips were yummy. I recommend  it.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

management - two old ladies. Never reply properly and many times charged double..so please keep your all receipts else you will be gone..
Restrooms are super dirty..when you go office to tell them, they just simply ignore you and say they are good.. but it took almost a day to clean them..
We have water and electricity site, water is not coming as they have broken pipe and not able to arrange any alternative and you can only connect one  air pump at a time else it will blow up electricity point... they did not even told us that water is not coming ,pipe broken. When we complain and ask for adjustment, they simple said..take it or leave it without refund.. seriously...
kids activities- mini golf broken, very old movie night and when we went there were no kids.. only swimming pool which has very cold and dirty water. SAP has yellow water ..oh God.. I will never recommend this KOA to anyone ...<//text>< pictures>

Beautiful Campground with all the amenities.  Camp hosts who maintain the campground and store were outstanding. Very friendly and helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat. we camped in our fifth wheel. What I loved about this place the most was it's not like other RV campsites. This one is actually off in the woods and you feel as if you are truly camping and not in an RV park that sits next to the highway or the train tracks</review>

Worst experience EVER! Booked reservations in advance and when we arrived to check in they did not have a spot to fit our travel trailer. They offered to park our trailer in a spot that wasn't meant for our size trailer, as in couldn't even open the front door and when we declined they turned our family away with no other solution. Literally said sorry, we can't (won't) help you. The lady at the front desk said we can "try" to complain to the owners but implied it won't help. What kind of person says that? We have camped at this KOA for many years and will never go back or recommend. If there was a negative stars option, Cloverdale/Healdsburg KOA gets -5 from me!!!</Text>

<Review>If you try and call no one will answer or return your call - why? Because you will be told even with your KOA discount it will cost you $70 (round off) for 30 amp which will go in and out, if you want WiFi it will cost you $6/day unless tou just want one hour but you will still have to fill out all your info and get an account. The road in if you are in a big rig it is dangerous- road is extreemly narrow with turns you cannot see around and overhead limbs! We will NOT ever stay or reconmend this KOA!< /Review><userid>110126724813451594834</userid><name>Carol and Dick Volckmann< /name>< resp>

Great campground, very friendly staff, great store and very good for families.  Sites are nice and have lots of tree coverage.  We would stay there again.   Caution the drive for the last mile is steep and windy, take it slow and easy.< /Text>

This RV Park has a lot of facilities including tent areas and lodges. On paper it should be great but I felt it was let down by two things. Firstly and most importantly, the "Summer" directions to the park do not work on a June day at 30 degrees centigrade, you have to follow the "winter" directions which means about a 6 mile detour.  Apparently a bridge "randomly" closes and hence the need to go a different way. This wouldn't be so bad except the office personnel don't know the area well enough to direct you. Once you go the "winter" route its actually well signposted so I'd suggest they simply remove the summer route from their website and tell people to go the other way.   Secondly, the restrooms and showers are OK but not great and I felt they let it down. Otherwise, this could be a good rv Park.</Text>

The facilities were alright, but not great.  Only one bathroom for the entire campground.
My biggest compliant is the way they handle the charges.  It is not clean nor professional and which leaves room for questions.  The additional of sales receipts each time you make a purchase even if it was to be added to your cabin charge would help everyone ensure charges were correct, no questions or ambiguity.</text>

<Time>1535940928381</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>The owner, Pam, was disrespectful and unprofessional. My family rented a cabin at her KOA. Prior to our reservation date we emailed and called for verification to bring our RV, but with no response. When we got there, we parked our RV and went to talk to her. She was condescending while telling us we had to move our RV. A simple no would have sufficed. My mother went to smooth it over with Pam who gave us a 4 person limit in the cabin. Pam told my mom the family could stay in the cabin for dinner, but only 4 could stay overnight which we agreed to. My family moved the RV. When we returned to the store to buy firewood, she proceeded to tell me that "I don't listen" and that I needed "to leave" for no reason. Then berated us saying we all needed to leave and only 4 could stay in the cabin. Dinner was already cooked, it was 8:45pm, and we had to leave. Despite the disrespect, we cleaned up the cabin and packed up. We turned in the keys to one of the workers, Charles, who was pleasant and empathetic. Clearly, we were not welcomed and drove back home. We will be seeking a refund and never coming back.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I don’t typically write reviews but I thought I would to hopefully sway someone to not believe these 1 star reviews. My wife and I camp all across the country and wanted a close to home get away. This is a great site. Not understanding of all the comments about it being “dirty”.... YOU ARE CAMPING! Or in our case glamping. Sites are nice, well take care of and lots of shade. Great amount of fun activities for kids and adults. Staff is very nice. Nothing bad to say about this place. We have a 18ft travel trailer for reference, we don’t tent camp but tent sites looked flat and spacious. Don’t let other poor reviews on here impact your decision making. Still here and already planning a trip back. Ps. Bathrooms are nice too.< /Review>

<text>This KOA is not good, especially for Motor Homes.  The roads getting to KOA are one way (too narrow) with trees hanging too low - scrape top of MH.  I mentioned this to the owner and she said that is the county job but the park was OK.  The park was not OK - I was running into low hanging branches on the way to my site.  The park is all dirt.  The site for my MH was too narrow and had the services right next to MH so couldn't open my water bay door all the way - had to hold it up and contort myself to get in there to  connect all the hoses etc.  The pool is a nice area but the water was too full, skimmer pumps were not running making pool very dirty on the bottom and the top.  Manager is crude.  I checked another site's electrical (30A) and it was not wired correctly.  And as most KOA's, they are way overpriced.  Never stay here again and do not recommend this place.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808406df371cd345:0x62b5f19794f5b5e3< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Can it get any better than that? Awesome park on top of the hill, overlooking the vineyards of Cloverdale. Very adorable and we enjoyed our stay there very much! Facilities are top with the spa/pool and the pond as well. And also the swinging benches are just faboulous and very inviting to spend a lovely sunset with your beloved one. Definitely worth the money< /text>

I called a couple times (had to leave a message and 2 days later got a return call) to make reservations for Memorial Day Weekend. Not a problem as there were still openings at the time. However, they could not tell which campsite I would be in as the lady on the phone said the sites change right up to the last minute. It would be nice to know where you will be (they do have a campground map) especially if you are with a group and want to be together. In my case, I needed a level spot as I was having surgery the prior week and was also camping with my son and his family so wanted to be close. The lady sounded genuinely concerned and said she would try to put us in a flat spot. Great. Well, upon thinking more and more about the type of surgery I would be having, I decided there would be no way I would be able to endure the weekend in my post-op condition. So, I have tried 3 times to call and cancel, to no avail. They have 2 phone numbers. One on the home page and an 800 number on a website. Called both numbers and could not leave a message as both mailboxes were full. Will try again all day tomorrow and hope to get through to them. I have heard the same complaints from other people. They are notorious for not returning phone calls in a timely manner. It isn't the greatest KOA, as the terrain is pretty rugged, but it was the only one with openings for that weekend. Wonder why??< /text>

We planned on using the Cloverdale / Healdsburg KOA as a site for our wedding.  The owner promised us many things in the beginning of the planning process which she did not deliver on. She added additional charges, failed to follow through on actions like acquiring noise permits and usage of easements and denied us usage of our ceremony site 8 days before our scheduled wedding, which she said was her decision. She is attempting to keep our entire deposit despite material breaches of our agreements. These are just a few of the problems that we had working with the owner.

She is very difficult to get a hold of and would ignore our communications. When we did finally get her on the phone, she would admit that she had read our emails and simply decided not to write us back. She was also very mean and difficult to our caterers. Do not plan events at the Cloverdale KOA.

We also camped there once as normal campers when we were working to improve the grounds for our ceremony site. That's right, we put in about 24 man hours of work improving the grounds of her property before she decided to deny us access to the ceremony site. The place is pretty enough, but it is unreasonably expensive, the workers are mean and incompetent.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Name>Julie Carpenter< /Name><Review>This was the dirtiest KOA that we have ever stayed at. The view was incredible and the property was filled with potential but it was FILTHY! The kids went to swim and there were dead bugs all over the surface of the pool. Sand was collected at the bottom of the pool as well. I am not saying a few bugs I am saying a dead bug about every 12 inches. The hot tub was green and unkempt as well. We rented a camping cabin. It had cobwebs all over inside. The grill on the bbq was rusted through. The bathrooms were actual pretty clean. I would tell people to keep on driving rather than to stay here.< /Review><Date>1495720689475</Date><user>111696423311883214784</user><gmapID>0x808406df371cd345:0x62b5f19794f5b5e3</gmapID><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Nice campground typical KOA facilities. But NOT near Healdsburg, the name is deceiving. 30-40 minute drive back down to wine country. Well off the highway several miles on a winding road.< /Review>

Nice campground but a little pricey. Staff loves rock music so much that they feel the need to share it with campers; so they pipe it into the campground so loudly you cannot hear someone speaking who is more than 10 feet away from you. When asked to turn the music down we were informed that we were free to find other accommodations and to forget about a refund. If you are looking for a quiet getaway I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. If you are looking for a nonstop rock concert from a rude staff then this is the place for you.< /Text>

Wifi is not free.  You have to pay after an hour and it does not have speed suitable for much of anything.  That was a drag because we were there Christmas Eve.  That aside , it is a beautiful camp ground and would be awesome in warm weather.<//text>

Don't bother calling to make a reservation. They never picked up the phone. When I was at the counter talking to the person, she ignored every call that came through. Make your reservation online. She was nice and accomodating. Our site didn't have electricity as noted online. We were surrounded by three families having birthday parties. It was not the quietest night. The bathrooms were clean. It was fine for staying a single night, but no longer.</Review>

Scenic view. We only stopped for a night (7pm-7am). When we arrived a man was blaring rock music out of his car, which was okay but it continued as we tried to go to sleep. He claimed to work there. The next morning the staff was very helpful and pointed us to wineries that we enjoyed. Bathrooms and showers were clean, camp sites were still dirty from 4th of July weekend.<//Text>

Rain most of the time but when the sun came out it was beautiful sights. They do need to haul in the gravel and trim the low hanging trees. Handicap stall was bad for 2 days. I have been to much more updated KOA's who's going rate was less. We will try again when weather is dryer.<//text>

I followed the KOA signs to this campground expecting a nice place.  It was awful.  I drove through and back out.  Sites grown up with weeds, shoddy appearance everywhere.  KOA needs to take their name off this one.< /Review>

We came back after 8 years and it doesn't look like there has been any improvements or much in the way of maintenance. The impression is this KOA is struggling and the location is probably why. It is in beautiful surroundings but not an easy drive from the highway for a big rig. We stayed at two KOAs on this trip and the other one was busy while this one was mostly deserted except for construction workers that were using it as a temporary home while working on a nearby job. Not a good sign.<//text>

<Time>1529972902306< /Time><text>My husband and i, We rented a small cabin. Cute, rustic,  a double and two bunk beds,  a swing on the porch. Fire pits, bbq pits. Games, laundry facilities,  shower and bath room facilities . Pool, ( THAT WHEN CLEANED AT NIGHT COULD BE READY FOR  8AM USE BUT WASNT READY TWO DAYS IN A ROW. THE HOURS POSTED FOR POOL WAS 8 AM TIL 10 PM.)  The mens bathroom needed more attention my husband feels. hot tub, horseshoes . Movie nights, fishing pond (catch and release) as well as miniature golf but wasn't opened while we were there. We couldn't ever get anyone live to speak to on the phone. The day we had to leave the pool wasn't ready when I went to use it at 9am. So I made use of the hot tub. Not really what I was wanting, you know how when your in the mood for a particular thing that is said to be included in what your paying for? That's my only complaint about this K.O.A. With all that said, YES, I will be back to visit. And we thank the staff for the services they provided.< /text>< GmapID>

So this was our 4th stay at Cloverdale koa. It was also the worst! First you can't through by phone anymore, leave messages but no one calls back, when we arrived  I went inside to check in and the woman at the counter rudely says "I taped your map to the door! " seemingly annoyed that she had to deal with a customer. Not really sure how I was supposed to see my name on the map since it was backwards in the first place..... So we set up camp. Beautiful sight although a little a overgrown but nothing we couldn't work with. Once settled in that's when we realized this is not the same family friendly place we were used to. Woman at the counter over charged my kids for ice cream, like way over charged by a couple bucks each ice cream! They went to the office to ask for a couple bundles of wood to be delivered to our sight the woman would not have it delivered (all koas we have been to including this deliver wood to your sight no extra charge)and instead sent my 11, 10, and 9 yr old daughters carrying bundles of wood back to camp in 100 degree weather!!!!!!! Their advertised activities are not truthful! There is no more movie night, no more banana bikes, no more peddle boats, billard table missing balls, table hockey missing pieces, mini golf not useable the putting greens were all torn and ripped up, concrete was broken, the so called water feature in the mini golf was nothing more than a murky puddle full of mosquitos! We stayed 3 nights and the restrooms were never cleaned there was feces smeared on the wall the whole time we were there ! We only seen two koa workers the whole time. No rules were enforced, game room was never closed pool was never closed either, there were kids swimming and yelling at close to mid night!! The entire place was over grown with weeds and low hangings trees, they don't even have the bench swings around the campground anymore! Really not a family friendly place! So sad to turn our backs on one of favorite spots I don't think we will ever go back! We'll miss the koa you used to be Cloverdale</Text>

<text>Avoid at all costs!  Website boasts "clean air" most of the days of the year, but with hundreds of campfires, the smoke is unbearable.  We rented a cabin near the lake.  VERY noisy. Worst camping experience in years.  Large family rented the one next to us and were allowed an additional tent set-up next to the cabin.  Played loud music all day and into the evening.  In the cabin on the other side the occupants opened all their doors of their pick-up truck and played load music.  It was as if the two were trying to drown out each other.  Again - this went on all day and into the evening.  They have a policy to keep noise levels low so that people can't hear you beyond their campsite, but there is absolutely NO enforcement.  They should ban all amplified music.  You go to enjoy nature and have to listen to latin music overlaid with country rock - so much for the "cricket and frog" concerts highlighted on the website.  Very ghetto.< /text></record>

Stopped by here on a Saturday evening with my family. We had a bunch of us in an RV and had a cabin reserved. After we checked in, we drove down to our cabin (cabin 3) and parked the RV next to the cabin like we used to at most other KOA that weve been to over the years. We noticed that there was a sign that said no RVs but we were able to back it in and were not blocking the roadway by any means. My brother went to talk to the office to see if there was a hookup area that we could park the RV since we were in this "no RV" zone... Pamela quickly said "YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO PARK THERE. IT WORRIES ME THAT YOU DROVE RIGHT PAST A SIGN THAT SAYS NO RVS"... my brother left and I went up to talk to her with my mom and she said the same thing... "there is nowhere to park it... we have no spots... etc etc. You need to park it at the train depot and have someone come pick you up". We asked if it was okay if we just left it there while we cooked dinner and ate and then we'd bring it down, but  she said no because it was a fire hazard because it would "take too long to get out of the spot". Keep in mind there is no grass around... just dirt and dried up yellow "grass". This isn't a fire hazard??

Anyways, after we move the RV, my uncle came back and noticed that there was an open spot for RVs with a hookup. It was 8:45-9p so theres a pretty good chance no one was coming. He went to go to talk with Pamela (who we found out was the owner) and the second he walked in with my brother, she immediately started pointing fingers at my brother and says "YOU...WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!  I TOLD YOU THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE". My uncle kindly asked her to calm down and he wanted to hear the story. He asked if we could bring the RV to the open spot and she quickly said NO WERE COMPLETELY FULL. He told her there was another open spot and she said "NOPE ITS TAKEN AND THERES NO WHERE ELSE FOR YOU TO PARK. WHAT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT". He said okay and that we were just going to eat dinner and bring the rest of the family to the RV at the train depot. She quickly responded saying that "only 4 people are allowed in the cabin...no one else." We said we just want to eat dinner... she said we are "no longer welcome here and that we needed to leave". She pointed to different staff members that were in the office to explain to us why, however they seemed to not want back her up. She said that everyone that was not on the 4 person reservation needed to leave immediately.

We sensed that we were not welcome here. We had everyone pack our things and left. She was no longer at the office, but a gentleman (Charles I believe) was there to accept the keys and apologize.

Not only was the owners service completely irrational, but the cabin itself was a complete failure. The outside lights were not working (one light on the stairs and the porch light) AND the hot water wasnt working at all. My wife had to take a cold shower... ice cold.

Unfortunately,  we will not be returning to this location. We were told this is "new management" as of a week ago. If this is what they are going to be like 1 week into owning and running this business, I'm scared to see how it will carry on. Best of luck, KOA. You may be best off disassociating yourself with this campsite.<//Text>

I tried to call several times to make a reservation and ask a few questions, but no one answered. That's completely fine, but it's just another thing to add to the list. So I made a reservation online, and expected we'd be okay to arrive after hours but could not confirm since I couldn't get ahold of anyone anyway. But I've worked at KOAs before and knew the late check in procedure; I figured we'd have a map on the door waiting for us to show how to get to our reserved campsite. When we arrived, there was a map for someone elses reservation, but nothing for us. I tried calling the after hours phone number that was posted, but of course, no one answered. Luckily we found an open site. None of the tent sites were nice though. We paid $55 for it, which is already ridiculous, but the sites were small and crammed together and basically just dirt. There were a ton of families with small kids running around like crazy, which is fine, but it continued well after quiet hours. We didn't sleep at all because people were drinking and yelling all night. The bathrooms were a complete mess and pretty gross. I would not say our stay was enjoyable in any way. We're not picky though! It's not that we're high maintenance. We just want a nice place to rest our head while on a long road trip. We ended up leaving at 4am because we couldn't sleep anyway. We've stayed at campgrounds all across the country, and this is one of the worst. However, the location, while a little off the beaten path, was really pretty so it deserves the one star for that.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>It saddens me that I feel the need to write this review, but the OWNER PAMALA DOES NOT DESERVE TO OWEN A CAMPGROUND. If this review helps one person to net be scammed by her then it is worth it. When calling to book I was able to get through to her and booked a cabin, but durning the process she hung up on me twice and once she had my cc info there was no getting ahold of her. After that happened I decided to check out the reviews and realized that is how she is and let me tell you after being there ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE TRUE. I watched her try to short change the person in line right in front of me. When I went to check out, she tried to charge me for two bundles of firewood I had brought from home. (look nothing like her bundles literally four pies of wood for $9.00) Then when I got my receipt she had charged me extra for my 4 year old daughter. When I questioned it, she said that it is how I reserved it online and she couldn’t change it. I had reserved through her on the phone were we talked about actives there for a 4 year old. She charged $11.75 plus 14% tax extra for each night when the website clearly states $11.50 extra per person over two people and children 0-6 are FREE. When I refused to sign the receipt agreeing to pay the extra fee, she said that I was not welcome anymore. she said her computers where down, but they where not a minute ago when she charged my card. She wanted me to sign a receipt and take her word that she would refund later that evening. She still has not and now I need to file a dispute with my cc company. The fact that KOA is still associated with this women after so many years of valid complaints is very disturbing to me. please whatever you do, DO NOT GIVE THIS WOMEN ANY BUSINESS.</Text>< pics>

Nice views, facilities and people. HOWEVER, the whole experience was made miserable by the constant droning of airplanes from a skydiving operation that operates close by. The planes circle right above the camp ground and ruin any chance of enjoying this KOA location. It was like having a lawn mower going outside your window all day. Bummer.</review>

Kinda pricey.  60 bucks with my KOA discount.
No TV.  No cable and could get nothing in the "air".
1 hour free internet, but the 1 hour must be continuous.
Long drive off of Hwy 101.
Kinda dirty/ dusty campsites.
Nice views, pool and pond.< /Review>

<text>My family (4 adults & 1 child) spent 4 nights over 4th of July We made our reservation with Pam who was obviously  over worked and could not  multi task if her life depended on it.  It took me 5 phone calls to confirm my reservation when  we asked for a site with shade.  She was somewhat rude and finally I asked her to verify my email after not getting one in 6 days. She had keyed in an incorrect email.
A couple of issues that I reported to the front desk was 1) the dock fell into the pond when a heavy set man walked on it.  It was obviously in need of repair from the  get go.  2) the first step in the pool was so sleek that many people, especially the seniors slipped into the pool. 3) on our last day of our stay the pool was locked at 10AM.  The front desk said that it wouldn't open until noon because the pool needed to be shocked.  There was no sign at the pool.  Why wouldn't they do this job early in the AM so people could swim prior to their check-out at 11? 4) There are no garbage cans at any of the sites.  So many people leave garbage in bags  until they find time to go to the trash bins which are so full and stink from the heat.  Why can't the owner
request additional  garbage pick-ups during holiday weekends?  5) the tent sites are loaded with poison oak and signs should  be posted so that children and/or adults are aware of this potential danger. There were many areas with dead debris in piles  which need to be removed so the sites look attractive. 6) there didn't seem to be very many staff people on site or no special events for a holiday weekend. 7) they should also have a Camper Kitchen for washing pots, etc. We finally found a couple of sinks in the laundry room which we used for this purpose, although we weren't sure this was allowed.
Overall, the one positive comment I have is that the restrooms, were usually clean and the showers were warm although the restrooms  need an up-grade overall.</text><user_name>james garatti<//user_name>< userid>

< Review>
Terrible experience! Trip was canceled short due to lice! We are KOA members and have never had this experience anywhere else.

First, when we arrived at our cabin, the outdoor table and firepit had been rearranged and we were unable to park. We tried to move the firepit and it was full of ash, cigarette butts, and broken glass. I did not want my 2 and 5 year old children to hurt themselves. The cabin was full of dust and cobwebs. We asked to change cabins, however they said it was fully booked and cabins reserved.

They finally sent someone to help return the table and firepit to its original position and clean up the ash and broken glass. The next evening my 5 year old daughter was itching her head, and we found lice. This was summer and the kids had not been in school or interacted with other kids. The lice had to come from the cabin. Our trip ended short and packed and left around 10pm. The nightmare continued with a trip to the pharmacy for lice removal kit and our poor children up past midnight with multiple shampoos and combing.

We tried calling, no one picked up and the mailbox was full. We called and spoke to the night attendant multiple times for a callback and have received no reply. It is such a shame, we where such fans of KOA. We still have reservations this year at other KOAs, however after this experience, there is no way we can go.</Review>

We had a group of four families and reserved our spot a few weeks in advance. The one who made the reservations for everyone had been to this KOA with her family a few times before and never had a problem with them. We were given confirmation numbers and tent sites as our reservation date neared. We noticed an issue when the first family arrived. The staff gave away our reservation to a party of ten people. They gave us a few RV spots instead, which were much smaller and much less conducive for tents in the summer heat. Great efforts were made by our people to get the original spots, but there was no apology, not much done to make up for their error. They could have made the party that just came in take our RV spot to honor our original reservation, but that didn't happen. We were given an additional RV site that gave us just enough room to get our tents in the site. The RV sites were on hard, packed ground that bent stakes and made a very hard ground on which to sleep. We were far away from bathrooms, showers, pool...all the amenities you would normally be close to with the tent sites. Thankfully they gave us use of one cabin for restroom use only. We have very small children with little bladders, so this was essential. We should have been offered a discount upon arrival, but we are waiting to have the 10% discount added to our card. There was also a big problem with the place RV's dump their waste. It overflowed the last evening we were there and smelled so very bad. They sprinkled lime on it and addressed an issue with the sewage at the other RV site. Again, no apology. One of the guys drove by and checked on us. He explained that he works on this problem every week. That was pretty troubling that knowing they had a problem like that, and that they put campers with tents on the site anyway with lots of small children. The older lady up front was very blunt and even rude at times. I thought I had clogged the toilet, and called to let them know since we couldn't find a plunger. She demanded to know why the toilet was clogged, so I told her I used the facilities and it wouldn't flush. Then she demanded to know where the key to the cabin was. It was just that she was very rude and kept giving us the run around instead of owning up to their mistakes. The facility as a whole looked run down. The mini golf doesn't really work anymore. The pool was nice. The cabin's toilet was just so low water and they made it use less water so that you had to refill the water in the tank a couple of times just to have a good flush. The grounds were just not as nice as you would expect from a KOA. We are not planning a return trip. We love camping, but their response to us just left us with a bad taste in our mouth...as bad as the smell from the waste and grey water running into our site! So beware. You might have a great experience IF nothing goes wrong. But if there's a misunderstanding in any way, don't expect them to help or care. Sad to say.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

the campsite was on a hill we had to use all of our levels to have our camper level. We even had to add an extra step just to get in and out of the trailer. There was trash everywhere  the ashes were still in the bbq pit. Not a place I would recomend!<//text>

Arrived after 5 with instructions on door to pick a site within available numbers written on door which didn't match campground map.  Man who obviously worked there ignored us.  Drove thru but saw no level site-- all hard packed dirt and per KOA app it would be 65.00!  Left and went elsewhere.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Sanitary facilities rather outdated. Do not hang clotheslines on your own parcel. For children but ideal place. Playground and swimming pool available and pond for fishing, which are not intended for consumption, the fish must be left in the water again.

(Original)
Sanitäre Anlagen eher veraltet. Wäscheleinen aufhängen auf der eigenen Parzelle verboten. Für Kinder aber idealer Platz. Spielplatz und Swimmingpool vorhanden und Teich zum fischen, die allerdings nicht zum Verzehr bestimmt sind, die Fische müssen wieder ins Wasser gelassen werden.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Actually, nicely located, the place is disappointing in many ways. Toilets and showers very dirty or out of order. This is unfortunately also a lot of the audience, the lack of good behavior. Pool nice, but water is murky. For wifi you had to pay $ 6 extra, still did not work. Office from 17 o'clock no longer occupied.

(Original)
Eigentlich schön gelegen enttäuscht der Platz doch in vielen Punkten. Toiletten und Duschen sehr schmutzig oder außer Funktion. Das liegt leider auch viel am Publikum, dem es an gutem benehmen mangelt. Pool ganz nett, aber Wasser ist trüb. Für wifi musste man noch 6$ extra zahlen, funktionierte trotzdem nicht. Office ab 17 Uhr nicht mehr besetzt.</Review><Name>Franz Arians</Name>< Rate>

The food is quite good here. The Beef Banh Mi was very fresh and crispy, and they stuffed it with a lot of meat. The Rice Noodle Vermicelli with Grilled Chicken was really tasty and filling. Everything was for takeout.

It is now open for indoor dining.< /Text>

<date>1496612121620<//date><rate>1< /rate><text>Do not recommend. Service is scary fast, to the point where you are certain none of the food is being made fresh. If you're in a rush, this place works great. Unfortunately, they use low grade ingredients, and the taste is bad. We got the pho and the egg rolls. The pho used beef that wasn't fresh, and the broth tasted very off. It seems they use tap water in their broth, and their tap water has a distinct taste that takes away from the flavor heavily.

The egg roll dipping sauce is unfortunately diluted down with water. Literally half of it was water, and none of it would actually stick to our rolls. The viscosity was a joke.

They do not respect the customer, and try their hardest to fool their customer and maximize their profit at your expense. Stay away.</text>< pictures>

I'm not usually a big fan of pho, but this place would be an exception.  This is the best pho restaurant I've ever been to.  The beef ball egg noodle soup was excellent.  Huge portions, like more than I should have eaten.  The preparation and presentation were great.  The price was a great deal for what you're getting. The service was friendly and attentive.  What's not to like?</Review>

Pho Fula has tasty Vietnamese food! I really enjoy the soups and the fried rice. You get your food pretty quick and a waiter brings it to you when you eat in the restaurant. They also have take out so you can order food to take home. It's really an amazing restaurant!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>The restaurant is a casual eating establishment.  They have a variety of Vietnamese Pho/soup options.  If you don't care for Pho there are rice and vermicelli dish offerings as well.  The food we ordered was flavorful and filling.  I would definitely be coming back if I visit the area again.< /Text><name>Benjamin Coleman< /name>< Resp>

<review>Big portions. Good value. Very good quality for the price. Pho (beef soup noodle) is piping hot and fresh. Soup base seem not to have MSG. Although the menu seem big, the dishes only differ slightly, for instance, just selecting a different cut of the beef became a different dish.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I've been coming here with a friend for a few years now and started bringing my family too...it is always on point! The pho is not greasy nor is it made w/MSG giving it a fresh and clean taste. The pork vermicelli bowl or any grilled pork dish is full of flavor. My husband likes the bo luc lac (diced steak dish). The portions of steak are generous; not once has it been skimpy. It's served with a lot of onions, mushrooms and lettuce.  When ordering to go also the pho is so huge! Generous portions here and the food is delectable. The service is good too. We love Pho Fula!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2ac340fbccb5:0x2fc299888b8b85d6< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a great place for some Pho or vermicelli noodles. The taste is great and wont disappoint. I have been going to Viet restaurants for years especially in the Garden Grove/Westminster areas and this place does not skip a beat. Enjoy!<//Text>

I just had a lengua burrito and it was delicious! A generously sized 🌯! I couldn't finish it. The tortilla was toasted to perfection on the outside. A great combination of meat beans and rice and Pico de Gallo. I will definitely come back.</review>

It's a mediocre place, food taste like 2 days old just reheated. Stick to the tacos on the street. Reheat food is to expensive a fat persons paradise high sodium to cover up taste.<//Text>

<text>I've been to this place many times and recommended it to a friend. Which tacos thrown together and one shell were soggy and old, the other two were broken. When I went to return them the staff was completely rude to say the least. I will never go back here again.</text>< Gmap_id>

Out of all the Albert's in L.A, this one is definitely the best in my book. I drive a few miles and pass many albertos/Albet's to come to this one..Line is long but it goes by fast and the food is delicious. My fav is the chile relleno buritto.< /review>

EDIT: Alberts is open late for drive through and take out. Theyre working hard to make sure we are all well fed. Truly a great crew who cares about their customers and always put their hearts in the food they serve. Let them know their hard work is appreciated, go get an amazing burrito and a bunch of tacos, you wont be disappointed.

Great food, fair prices. Went back a second night in a row it was so good. HIGHLY RECOMMEND<//Text>

Cashier is not wearing a mask and cook is serving food with his mask down the chin so mouth and nose is open. Better to get food from big chains. Or at least this place is doing a bad job< /Review>

<Review>Carne Asada fries here are good like everyone says. Their prices went up though because of the meat shortage I think. Went there and got Super fries, and an order of mini fries, and total came out to almost $30. Still good though.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

This place has gotten so bad!! First their breakfast burritos are not what they used to be and now I ordered Beef Enchiladas and they were filled with nothing but Bell Peppers, Tomatoes and Onions, little to NO meat. I used to recommend this place to everyone, especially if they were visiting from out if town, but not anymore. They have gotten my $$ for the last time.</Review>

The carne asada fries used to be bomb but now they put no effort into making them. The fries were stale and they didnt have enough asada, guacamole, sour cream or anything else. The ratio wasn't great.< /text>

I ordered super fries at 4:31pm and they didn't give me my order till I asked if it was ready, even then they took like 5 more minutes and the total wait time was like 36 minutes. Place wasn't even packed and they have 4 people working making the food. Would give 0 stars if I could< /Text>

I used to love coming to this place. They had friendly cashiers and awesome customer service. I just made a phone order for pick up and was told to go in 12 minutes. (Order was placed at 10:04pm.) I get there, order was given and as I get home, I see the receipt and it says "Car Recall" with specific orders to not add sour cream (which I never made) and the time said 21:19. I called to see what exactly car recall meant and if they had given me someone elses order as it showed a different time. The lady who took my call was very rude. She said that if the receipt was the problem to bring the receipt back. Never answered my question I was not expressing anger or anything. Was simply asking a question.  After many years of buying take out from this place, wont be returning.< /Text>

<Text>Very good Mexican fast food. Up to my standards. I guac is fresh made and tastes great. I got super fries and rolled tacos. Will return when in the area again. Beware though, the super fries have beans on them if it matters to you. I'm not a fan of it but was still good.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

There's several Alberto's throughout Los Angeles, but this is the only one I keep coming back to. The place is clean, food is good, and the prices are incredibly low. The reason i give it 4 stars, is due to the sometimes difficulty in finding parking. Their lot fits 8-10 cars... But feels like it can only accommodate 2. But other than that, if your hungry and in the area... This is the one place I recommend. I've had everything on the menu, the only item I didn't like was the Fish Taco. So, check it out this hidden tiny foodie joint for yourself. Believe me, you won't regret it!
*Best item on the menu: Carne Asada Tostada 😋<//text>

<review>Food is great, always satisfied with whatever i get. Although, I usually get the asada fries, those are the best. It's just small so you can't really go with a group of more than 4 friends. And the restroom is always dirty so unless you really can't hold it avoid it!!<//review>< user_id>

Food and portions are good but the food is overpriced for the average Joe. Minimum wage aka 1 hour of your life just for 1 plate of asada fries. Yeesh never again. Next time I'll go to IN N OUT where a delicious filling burger is only about $2.50. If you like giving away what you make in 1 hour for asada fries go ahead.</Review>

The food was delicious. My only problem was with the person who took my order. I specifically made my burrito a wet one, but it didn't come out that way. When I told him what I said, he admitted that he didn't hear that part. They're not getting 5 stars because I was charged for a mistake I didn't make! Other than that, it was a good experience, and will consider coming back, due to the wide variety of food they have...</text>

<review>Great food. Great service. Either dine-in or order via drive-thru and enjoy the same amazing food. Try the rolled tacos Supreme. I put the carne asada on the side for small tacos later and love the southern California style of cooking taquitos aka rolled tacos. It reminds me of home, San Diego.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Overall good food. My only problem is the amount of times they have messed up my order... so when customizing something make sure to repeat and ask them to repeat to see if they understood. 😪<//Review>

Great mexican food that is really cheap. The price is right for what u get. The drive thru lady sounds like a 6 year old child that is hard to understand what she is asking or what my total was. There was 4 other ppl in front of me in the drive thru and it took over 30 mins before I got to the window. Other than slow service the only reason y I'm giving this a 2 star is because they cook their beans in pork fats and that's just disgusting since pork is the most dirtiest meat out in the world and the beans taste like they were cooked in a trash can<//review>

Maximum capacity is about 30 people. Each table hold 4 people. The service was reasonable not bad but not a five star restaurant.
I ordered the super fries and let me tell you its a huge portion of food. I came in famished but even that said I was not able to finish my food.
The chunks of beef on the fries was so juicy and packed with a lot of flavor maybe due to the spices. DONT CHANGE THE RECIPE!

I also notice a couple of tables dirty it makes sense if Alberts was busy but not a lot of guest were at the store so there is no excuse.

Reminder. Tables should get wiped down after guest are done dinning in.

I recommend coming on down and give their food a try you won’t be disappointed unless the tables are dirty but that should not sway you away from dinning in use your voice and ask the wonderful employees.

Sometime it can a bit untidy, but biiiiiiitch... them carne asada fries(super fries) are everything... If I could, I'd eat them every day. And also try the Super fries wrap/burrito, it's just as good and it's huge. Try ordering the burrito with chorizo instead, it's really good! And the girls there are super nice. It is a 10 minute wait though... but it's worth it!< /text>

This place some of the best beans and cheese burrito that I've had since moving to LA. The wait in drive thru is long and seating inside is very limited but the food is speaks for itself. All their meat is well seasoned and the Carne Fries my friend always gets is to die for.

Good place to go whatever time it is<//Text>

To be honest I have never went inside I have always order in drive thru to be honest the food is so good here everytime I come I order the Big Tacos from carnitas. They do take a bit of time to give you your food but it's a good place to come with your friends or family... Bom<//review>

<Review>When I'm craving Mexican fast food, Albert's is my go to place!
Their carne asada nachos w beans, shredded cheese, sour cream & guacamole are good! I dislike onion so the fact that their guac doesn't contain any allows me to enjoy my food even better. The rolled up taquitos w guac & cheese are also another one of my selections. Their horchata drink is refreshing!
They have a variety of different salsas you can serve yourself along with cucumbers, lemons, radishes, vinegar dilled carrots, onions & child's.
Customer service is great! I have no complaints so far.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c917cb484ccb:0x56a4c61f1aa8b5fa</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I ordered the asada fries and they were so disgusting. They were unappetizing and on the first bite, they made me nauseas. They tasted like trash and that’s exactly where they ended up in. Never ever ever ever again.🤮🤮< /Text>< pics>

They lack customer service big time. The rush you in the drive thru while looking at the order menu. Also the price are crazy two dollars extra for extra cheese. They act like they are doing you a favor.< /Review>

Asked for al pastor fries, no sour cream yet ended with more cream than actual al pastor meat so I was very disappointed also asked for an horchata with no ice and ended with a cup full of ice. Last time I’ll be stopping by here to eat.</review>

<text>Great customer service, don't have to wait long to get your order, love the salsas because they are different from all others and have this certain zest to it. The only thing I would change is put a lil rice and a lil less beans on the super burrito oh and have crispier frys in it instead of the soft fries. Otherwise content with the whole outcome, love the service, friendly staff team that works in unison! I will definetly recommend my family and friends to come and try the food. Thanks y'all!<//text>< pictures>

The food is great especially the super taquitos: that's an order of five taquitos topped with guacamole sour cream pico  de Gallo, fresh ice berg lettuce and topped with their savory mouth watering carne asada!!! #todiefor #goodeats< /text>

(Translated by Google) The food is of very good quality, which is why I don't give it 5 stars is because they give you a glass of about 1 ounce of sauce for 2 h or 3 orders that you buy and you ask for more and they give you bad

(Original)
La comida es de muy buena calidad el cual por el que no le doy 5 estrellas es por que  te dan un baso como de 1 onza de salsa  para 2 ho 3 ordenes que compras y les pides mas  y te las  dan de malas<//review>

(Translated by Google) The alberts burritos are the best. We have been to different places in this chain, south gate, downey, bell and norwalk but the truth is that these from hp are the best and we lived in long beach. We have to do the tour whenever we want but it is worth it.

Los alberts burritos son lo mejor. Hemos ido a diferentes lugares de esta cadena, south gate, downey, bell y norwalk pero la verda estos de hp son los mejores y nosotros vivios en long beach. Tenemos que hacer el recorrido cada que se nos antojan pero vale la pena.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) On Monday morning I ordered 2 breakfast burritos. I paid the hard-earned money. just to get home and get something to eat. I knew immediately that the meat had gone bad. Alberts Mexican Food sold contaminated meat. DO NOT TRUST the Huntington Park location.

(Original)
El lunes por la mañana pedí 2 burritos de desayuno.  Pagué el dinero que tanto me costó ganar.  solo para llegar a casa y comer algo.  Inmediatamente supe que la carne se había echado a perder.  Alberts Mexican Food vendió carne contaminada.  NO CONFÍES en la ubicación de Huntington Park.</text>
