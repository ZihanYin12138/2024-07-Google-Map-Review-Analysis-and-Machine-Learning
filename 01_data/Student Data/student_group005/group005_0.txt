I was there at 8:47am on a Tuesday and there were about 10 people in line with only 1 person working behind the counter. The line moved quickly enough but if I had been in a hurry it could have been more stressful. Make sure you get there with plenty of time to spare just in case.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODNam8qdBiJuUQPD0mKGhWqghONccvDRNxd5pp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdP4dT0JB-mkT0sgtWOxPTjZ-h_Eu_ymiaUVGo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I dropped two small packages in a drop box next to my house. Two days later they still haven’t been scanned into the system. Called this post office 15 times with no answer. So I drove here as it’s the location that picks up the stuff from the drop box, explained my situation to the older female with black curly hair, small eyelashes, just to be told “so what are you asking me” and “next time you should just wait in the line” and that stuff dropped in the drop boxes don’t get scanned until they reach their destination! Maybe there should be a damn disclaimer on the drop box and employees shouldn’t tell their customers to “just wait in the line next time” with a sh*tty attitude<//Text><time>1617206423614< /time><gmap_id>0x80dcd997179a7d17:0xc970c4e624690774<//gmap_id><response>None</response>< Rate>

Package slip left was not completed by USPS and confusing without providing any option to pickup at a closer USPS Post Office, which we have many.

<Review>To have a post office (government based business) employed and paid for by tax payer dollars to be spoken and treated disrespectfully and hung up on instead of trying to help out a customer is uncalled for. Ferrell is very unprofessional and short tempered. The only person at that post office with any level of respect is Jeremy.<//Review></record>

I called the post office on Wednesday requesting they hold a package for me. The package was not held. The package was sent pack to the sender two days later.
Poor customer service and poor cross communication between employees.
Also, having a person actually answer the phone would be so incredibly helpful, rather than hang up on you every single time you call.
That understaffed, eh?< /Text>

Mail carriers from this office have not had the proper training. They don't pick up mail in mailboxes even when the red flag is up to tell them there is mail and they have dropped mail into the box.  I subscribe to Time magazine. It's a weekly.  I'm lucky if I get my Time every other week.  The level of incompetence from the mail carriers is shocking.</Text>

I called the post office to see if we can come in to do my passport, but I was informed that if I come in before 11:15 I would be able to get the passport done. We got there at 11:10 and they said they wouldn’t accept my passport application. I spoke to their supervisor and she would accept it either; even though I called in beforehand. Furthermore, I would not recommend this place to anyone to do their passport. Horrible customer service!</text>

Edit* Worst post office. Why do I have to buy a label to write the address. Don’t you guys print it out when I pay for it. Why do I have to pay extra because your machine isn’t working. Such a scam. (Had to add this in front of my other review because you can’t leave more than one even if you have multiple bad experiences)Extremely rude employees! This is right down the street from my work so it’s the most convenient one but they are so rude here. I’ve been treated extremely rudely 3 separate times (3 separate people) I have come here. If you don’t like the postal bushiness don’t work at a post office and be rude to your customers. I have left this post office before to go to a different one because of how rudely I was treated and it made me late back to work to have to drive extra on my lunch break. Please get nicer employees.</review>

<text>Why hasn’t my package started tracking yet? I dropped a package off at 5:02pm yesterday (sadly I just missed being able to go inside to hand it to a person) inside the post office at the package drop box just opposite the entrance. On that package drop it says that the packages are picked up at 5:15pm so my package should have been scanned last night at least. However, it’s the middle of the next day and no scan as of yet and I have a buyer who wants to know where her things are.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Worst place Big zero to the entire staff , if you are applying for the passport you will regret cuz they are lying they charged me 120$ extra for two passports that I am going to received it in 2 weeks but it’s been 4 weeks and still I don’t have my passports , always choose the regular delivery for your passport don’t choose the express one they are just taking your money and it’s taking the same time as the regular one it’s not in their hands , and you they are very very slow .</Text>

I mailed a package on March 10, 2017 from a Kansas post office.  The expected delivery date was March 16, 2017.  The tracking information displays that it was received at this location on March 18, 2017.  This post office has still yet to deliver the package and it is March 22, 2017.  I sent my niece to pickup the package at this location and they said they don't have it.  In addition to them saying they don't have it they can't explain why they don't have it even though the online tracking software says it is there.  I proceeded to contact my local Kansas post office who is trying to track the package down but the Santa Ana post office phone number doesn't work to talk with anyone.  The mailbox is full and no one answers the phone prior to getting the mailbox full message.  I will never send a package via USPS ever again.  UPS and FedEx will receive all my business from here forward.</review>

The clerk I went to was extremely rude from the start of our interaction.  I went in with a positive attitude because I know how stressful things can be during this time of year, yet the clerk was so out of line that he shifted my entire mood. I really hope he is a one off and not all the employees are like him.< /Text>

I hate this post office so much and generally all of them. This is the only post office that continually lossing my packages.  There isn’t a secure measure at the drop off counter(I’m not talking about the drop off with a lid). Any customers can just reach over and take your packages or pretending they are dropping off something, looking for something near that area and take things. And then they tell me to come in and ask for someone to help me if I need to. Bunch of liars and pretenders to be nice to you so you can quick hang up the phone thinking they are nice. Do you know how busy and slow they are? Manager is hardly see when being called, take them forever to show up or find a package. How can I be in and out if you have a line of people and manager is already away helping another line??? They make drop off areas and pre print labels convienient for consumers but won’t secure those areas by clearing them as soon as they are full and make sure people can’t easily reach over and just take any packages. Like move the manager’s desk over to that area or something, or have it between cashers. Ugh!
Updates: days later
After first review I gave this post office 2 stars I now gave it 1 and if I could give it nada I would. I wish I could. I came in with 3 packages already have labels and all I need was just to make sure they were scanned so they don’t go missing without any answers anymore. The same person that told me to come in and see him when I need packages scan because they kept loosing mines. I came in and saw him, I asked him to scan them for me he said “I’m busy because I am already helping someone else with a project I need to finish”. Then hurried up to walk away. What did I said about them say “come in I(we) will help you” above? And he is the manager there. Time to find UPS to deliver my packages.< /review>

Every time I go in there the staff is  pleasant. Never had a problem with anything. Pleasant when I called to inquire about not receiving mail as well.   Always super quick and efficient.< /review>

<review>Trying to get a passport on a Saturday.  They only have one teller.  The line is from wall to wall and they don't even think off putting another teller to help her.  I am aware they open Monday thru Friday but I work from 8am-5pm.  Seriously have more consideration on your poor employee and the customers.< /review>< pictures>

For the second time in a row, my next day letter is MIA and no one knows what's going on.  Trying to talk to Robert at this location took 15 minutes or more on hold.  They seriously have no concept of the value of their client's time nor do they have any respect for the sense of urgency associated with a "next day" letter.  I will be using FedEx from now on.  I don't even care about the postage refund I needed the documents yesterday as promised.< /review>

<Review>Really bad phone customer service. If they don't want to work don't answer the phone. First they said don't have customer service in Spanish I ask for the next available agent and the woman make fun of my accent . She said didn't understand what I was saying. At the end she suggested that I need to go to my local post office. The reason of my call was that I can't go to the office and I need to find a package that was sent last week the woman said there is nothing she can do about it. Really bad attitude. Also I was in hold for 20 minutes. Not nice.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

My mom and I had the worst experience here. She was trying to return phones to our carrier and she accidentally sent them out with USPS instead of UPS like she was supposed to. She hadn't realized the mistake until the second package she sent with USPS was delivered but the first one wasn't.  When we went to THIS office the old man who helped us was sarcastic and gave us the "well that sucks" attitude and even laughed in our faces. Then when my mom asked to speak to a manager he gave her attitude but got the attention of the lady sitting two seats away. She then told my mom that it was her problem because she sent them through the wrong carrier. She also told us that they just pass off the phones to UPS when they come but they don't keep any logging of these packages.
Overall the customer service here sucks and they need a better way of tracking these packages because mistakes happen and they get a lot of them.<//Review>

Apparently Everyone receives bad service at this post office. Go in with two (2) cards, one standard and one square (clearly marked for Extra Postage Required) so I expected it to be more than the standard card. But the man behind the counter tells me that I have to pay EXTRA postage ON TOP of the the already existing Extra Postage because the card is square. I took 3 minutes from my work day because too many people, I have a day job. I get off work AT 5pm, the same time the P.O. happens to close. I was blocks away when I realized I was charged extra Extra Postage not once but TWICE. The man was rude and unfriendly to begin with. I can't even say he was just all business because really, he was just rude. So I spent the rest of my time in the car trying to contact someone. That took over 25 minutes to get a human, in the wrong department because Customer Service, Operator, agent are not options when calling. She hears my complaint and forwards it to the mgr. My phone rings once and stops. Next thing I know, I have a vm. It's the mgr telling me I have to come back. I just got off work, it's 5:15 so No, I can't just turn around and come back! I call back and he the same mgr. I was told I should've have pointed it out whole still there. I'm so sorry that I took for granted that the guy behind the counter could do his job right and NOT OVERCHARGE ME. I was blocks away when I realized it and still working and I can't just take a vacation day to come back. "Well, whose fault is that?" he says to me. Then goes on further with the insults and says he has no way of proving whether I'm lying or not, so I should have said something sooner.  Now I'm being accused of trying to commit fraud against the usps? Seriously? The only chance I have to go back is on Saturday, I shouldn't have to chance losing my job to go back because the rep behind the counter couldn't do HIS job right in the first place! If you value your own sanity, find another post office to go to. Because the rudeness and complete lack of polite and decent Customer service is all that exists at this one. And it starts way higher than just the folks behind the counter actually servicing you. Absolutely unbelievable and unacceptable. I now understand the phrase, Going Postal. I certainly would if I had the misfortune of having to work with anyone like these 2 men. I went in 2 cards and wound up paying $2.31, .49 for card and $1.82 (.91 x 2) for the square card. But of course, I'm just a lying and dishonest person according to the mgr. Unbelievable and unacceptable.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I called them 5 times to inquire about a mistake with my package and no one answered my phone call even though it was during the hours they were open and it was no where near lunch time. And when I called back the next day and finally got someone to answer (only had to call three times that time) she was very rude<//Review>

In reguards of Cynthia Rivera'.....This country is not based in a language  and you do not need to know english or spanish you can be a citizen in any language, second of all spanish is one of the most spoken language in the world. In this country it's not in the constitution to know english to be a ciziten look it up and learn your facts. Second of all who the hell are you? You're Hispanic and don't even know your own home language?  That is as ignorant as it gets, you don't even know your home's nor your country's culture that's a true ignorant....sad< /text>

<Review>As with all post office, staffs doesn't want to be there. Passport lines are wall to wall, however, there's only 1-2 people working. Average time is apparently "20 minutes" per person, multiply that by 30 people in lines and that's your wait time.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcd997179a7d17:0xc970c4e624690774< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been a dental patient with Dr. Ford's office for over 30 years.  Excellent care, wonderful staff, and modern equipment.  Just had a cap done this year that went in perfectly.  Cleanings are thorough and excellent.  Office is conveniently located and in a nice suburb. 5 stars for sure.<//Review>

<Text>I’ve been coming to Ford Dental for over a decade. When I moved to a different city and had a small child I tried a dentist closer to my home for the convenience and got told I needed a crown after the shortest cleaning I’ve ever had. I went back to Ford for a second opinion out of pocket and was told I actually didn’t need a crown at the time and the Dr. fixed it while telling me I would probably need a crown eventually. That was over 5 years ago and my teeth feel great. At the most fundamental level you need to go to a dentist that you trust you know isn’t trying to rip you off and that you’re comfortable with.  Poking around in your mouth is such a personal thing that you absolutely need to feel secure and free during to express your concerns or worries.  I’ve never had a bad experience at Ford Dental, and it really says something that Dr. Ford’s son is now working for the same practice and has the same reputation to live up to. They are fantastic people that make you feel like family, and I will never go anywhere else even if I have to drive 100 miles. Incidentally, Dr. Ford Junior is just as fantastic as his dad and uncle and gives me hope for the future!<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>104256316511612337170<//UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

It’s always difficult to find a really good dentist.  At Dr. Ford’s office there are two wonderful doctors who explain what’s going on with my teeth very clearly.  It’s very comforting.
Not only they are fantastic dentists, but also they have nice and friendly stuff and hygienists too.< /Text>

Additionally, all of the dental work that I have needed has been very very carefully done by the dentists and the excellent staff. The receptionist and administrative staff are part of this excellent office culture. The practice has also referred me on occasion to other specialty dentists for a tooth implant, for example. And those referrals were also excellent.  Now, my dentist is the son of the dentist who treated me originally. I find this whole experience really great in this day and age.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I have been going to the Dr. Fords for decades. I am always happy with their service. They are out of the way for me but with Saturday appointments and the trust I have with them makes it worth the trip. My teeth feel great and I am looking forward to my next appointment.< /Text>

I’ve been a patient for years, decades actually.
I was there today for a cleaning and exam. My bothersome tooth is happy now, I am better informed as to home care and have a referral to a specialist if needed.
My visit was as pleasant as these things can be.<//text>

Another great visit! They practice show and tell here, meaning you are told what’s done in your mouth. After a horrible ( other) dentist experience, I came to senior Dr. Ford with a dentist phobia and really bad gums. Under his care, I have had the best checkups and healthy teeth and gums. His son now works in the practice too and has rave reviews with my younger friends. This is clearly a place you tell your friends about!<//Review>

<Review>Avoid this place. They miscommunicate information around insurances just to get you in the door. They tried to charge ‘premier’ rates and mixed up charges completely. When I called, they wouldn’t even look into it unless I come in??

I dont think they even have a vmail set up. Guess the signs were there all along.

Dr Ford (younger one) is nice but new to his job - he made mistakes on filling a small cavity, which ended up taking nearly two hours for a small filling.

Dr. Ford - my mom came in for filling. You are well aware of this and the reason why I called. She doesn't speak English like you or I. Your staff not only made a mistake on the provider my mom has for dental (charged delta premier rates when she has Delata ppo not Dellta premier) but rudely refused to even look into it when I called. Incompetence like that deserves to documented so everyones aware what your office is like.</Review>< pictures>

We have a voicemail system and we have no records of any restorative treatment (filling) done at our office by any of the doctors. You called our office multiple times issuing threats of a bad review and you were very rude to our front desk staff each time. Once you asked for release of your records, since we have physical copies, we asked for you to come in and pick them up. We felt it was best for you to come in additionally and discuss with us what your issues were and make them right.'}< /Response>

<review>We travel across the Bridge in order to see Drs. Ford & Ford. My husband has been a patient of this practice for 50 years & I for almost 30 years. Every time we think about switching to someone closer to home, we go to an appointment & decide that we don’t want to change. Love the doctors and the staff❣️<//review>< pictures>

<text>I’ve been going to Ford Dental for close to 20 years. Sometimes I ask myself why I drive all the way from Oakland to El Cerrito to see the dentist. The answer is, I like my dentist. That hasn’t changed with the addition of “young Dr Ford” to the practice. They are thorough and careful, and take all precautions  during purple-tier Covid times. (And if you’re lucky, you might get to listen to KCSM jazz instead of Muzak while you’re waiting! 😄)</text>< Rating>

<text>Ford Dental is the BEST!!  I have been living in Berkeley temporarily and had a dental emergency.  I was referred to them by a friend, and called and spoke to Dr. John Ford.  He took time to discuss my problem and set up an appointment for me the very next morning.  Their office is immaculate, and they have taken every possible precaution to make sure everything is sanitized, especially in this time of the virus. Dr. Paul Ford met me and proceeded to examine my teeth in a new, state of the art dental chair.  He and Dr. John Ford discussed the best possible solution to my problem, and made excellent recommendations. They are so kind, extremely professional and knowledgeable, and they take all the time needed to discuss and resolve any dental case. I am so grateful for their care, and I can not recommend them enough!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Ford Dental is amazing. My experience here is second to none. I neglected my teeth for almost 4 years before visiting. Upon arriving at Ford Dental I was happily greeted and comforted by the receptionists (Laura & Linda).  The waiting room is very clean and so is the entire practice.  My initial cleaning went very well , but after XRays Dr. Paul informed me that i had at least 3 cavities.  I have never had a cavity before, and was terrified of the thought.  Seeing that I was very sensitive - Dr. Paul and Dr. John made me feel very comfortable and took care of the cavities with ease.

I have never had such an amazing experience with a dentist in my entire life. The family practice Ford Dental are highly recommended and will be the only Dentists to ever work on me again A++++

Thank you Paul & John!</review>

The food honestly is a five star . Taste like actual restaurant. The only reSon i didnt slap the 5 stars was because  i thought it could have been  a few bucks cheaper. Afterall it was late and itd to go so thetes no throwing out trash or cleaning after us. Two thumbs up.  .<//Text>

Cemitas Poblana is my favorite Mexican sandwich!  And the El Monchis trucks are my favorite Cemitas maker. I’ve tried several others in my hunt for delicious Cemitas. Highly recommend the milaneza breaded fried steak w two cheeses.</review>

I ordered four Cemitas de Milanesa by phone. Two Jalapeño and two Chipotle. CASH ONLY!! I learned the hard way. The total was 34 and I only had thirty dollars on me. I told the guy I would leave a cemita and he told me to pay him later. AutoZone does not give you cash back. I went to Walgreens and returned.

Good sandwiches! Warm and filling!! Thank you for the trust and the delicious Cemitas!! God bless this establishment!< /Text>

I love this Urgent Care! I've been coming here for 8 years. Dr Cody and Dr David  are so knowledgeable and caring. They both help me with all my concerns and keep me healthy so I am able to heal others.  They are both very handsome which makes for a pleasurable visit. ; ) The front desk staff is also very kind as well as the medical assistant who makes for great conversation and laughs. There is usually no wait and the office is clean and well sanitized. I highly recommend this office and the wonderful group that keeps it running smoothly.<//Text>

This is my second time here after receiving great and prompt service the first visit. Came in for a rapid covid test for travel, Dr Iskandar and the MAs on staff that day were all wonderful. Made the experience easy even when someone is shoving a swab up your nose. Highly recommend.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>The other day I was in a lot of pain and feeling absolutely awful. Unfortunately, I've been to too many doctors, too many emergency rooms, and too many urgent cares. Sometimes when you feel bad all you want is someone kind caring and compassionate to help you, wich often isn't the case. But not here.
Facebook friends and family I believe I met the best doctor in the world right here in Noho. I was really upset and confused. He looked into my eyes and reassured me that there was nothing to be upset about and he was there to fix it. He listened to how I had gone to several other doctors complaining and explaining of my many symptoms.
For once I felt heard.
For once I felt I could really trust this man to help me and he did.  It's been a few days on my new meds and boom! Im up and walking around volunteering again and feeling young.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart Dr. David.
I pray my son grows to be as wonderful of a human as you are.
You really touched my soul thank you.

Excellent care given to my 11 year old. We are from out of state which made the situation a bit scary; Ive never taken my child to any doctor other than our pediatrician. The facility was clean and the staff was nice. Our nurse was exceptional as well as the doctor. Both were very thorough and gentle with my child. Highly reccomend this place.<//text>

<text>My mom came for an emergency check up and left with a scratch in her eye that prevented her from doing any activity fr about two weeks. Her eye hurt so much the first night she couldn't sleep.
The doctor who attended us had a broken arm, he was not careful at all handling the instruments when checking on my mom's eye. Despite not being an ophthalmologist he decided to add some drops which he spread with a thin white piece of paper. Right when he did, my mom told him it hurt badly. He said it was the drops that hurt. My mom and I trusted this doctor and didn't think much of it.
That night my mother couldn't sleep at all and had to spend extra money on the injury, but more importantly it prevented her from living life normally for two weeks.
When we came back to ask for a refund and complain about the doctor, the manager was nice and listened to all what we had to say. She tried to help us get justice, but the board did not want to accept responsibility for the neglect of the doctor. They said all their doctors were trained and wouldn't make a mistake like this... I think if this was true, you would not allow a doctor with a broken hand to check a patient that has a delicate injury in her eye.
Since this urgent care does not want to accept its doctor mistake, we are taking legal action.
DO NOT come here if you'd like to get healed.< /text><user>100343494131677381921<//user>< time>

I think the staff esp people who answer the phones for inquiries need to know their services better. Called the day before to ask about the Quantiferon test and was very specific saying the blood test for TB and they said yes, $30 only and just walk.in. i even asked twice to make sure because i had to call out of work for this.
Today ended up being told that I had to pay $99 to see doctor to get a referral to do the Quanti test then pay $240 for the test plus an Xray with another fee.
FYI: people who have BCG vaccine will likely test positive for the TB Skin Test which is why we ask for the Quanti test.
If you guys can't give that for $30, next time inform us. Don't make us go there and tell us to pay all these fees and make us miss work for nothing.< /Text>

Staff was really nice and served me quickly. Dr. Iskandar mis diagnosed me ear infection as outer ear only (it’s middle ear) and then on the same day mis diagnosed my niece’s influenza as a normal cold. Got a second opinion for my ear and got proper antibiotics. My sister in law pushed for a flu test which was positive. Nice people. Negative results for me.<//text>

I spoke to Nancy at the front office staff was so welcoming and courteous. I got taken in within 5 min of walking in and a doctor walked in about 10 min after. I got stitches and was on my way home in no time.  This place took care of me fast and with affordable prices without breaking my bank.

<Review>The medical care is fine once you get in. But I waited two hours before getting seen. That’s ER-level mismanagement. Two other people in front of me left in a fury as they were missing work and getting parking tickets. Lots of yelling and huffing. I’d try another clinic first if you can, and obviously if your situation is truly urgent, I wouldn’t even consider this as an option.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>The used car salesmen of medicine! They are desperate to make as much money as they can finding ways to up charge you any way they can. They prescribed the wrong medication to me just so I'd have to come back so they could charge me for a second visit and an X-Ray. THEY ALWAYS OFFER AN XRAY! So funny! I have bronchitis! You don’t need a f-ing Xray to tell you that! Beware this place. They WILL find ways to up charge you. They will take advantage of the fact you feel bad enough to pay whatever it takes to feel better. Best just to steer clear of this place. Go somewhere that actually cares about making you well again.<//review><Time>1571452842260<//Time>< user>

I went here about 2 weeks ago and had a terrible experience. Spent 2 hours waiting to be seen for about maybe 7 minutes by the "doctor". I went in for a sharp foot pain that had me almost need crutches or a wheelchair and all I was told was to take advil and ice. Personally, I don't go see a professional to be told something that seems pretty common sense not to mention the lack of bedside manners by the doctor. The cover of my insurance was also discussed loudly in the hallway between nurses where other patients could hear so don't expect all your information to be private. I would never go here again and not recommend it to anyone looking for actual service and care.</Text>

<Text>I waited just about the time estimated on the website (a handy feature) and the staff was super friendly. Waiting room was very clean and comfortable. Metered street parking was just fine since I arrived so near 6PM, it only cost me two quarters for 30 minutes and after 6PM it's free.

Very professional and the doctor had excellent bed side manner. For a holiday, my wait wasn't terrible and this is a very nice facility. If I have an issue again, I will definitely return to this Urgent Care.</Text>

Just remember this is an urgent care and not a hospital.
If you have a "very minor"  injury or illness this place may work well for you.
But if you have anything more then that . . . you will probably be referred out to a doctor or hospital like I was.

There was no doctor in the office just a physician's assistant named paul.
I would rate the overall experience as following from 0 to 5 star . . .

Physicians assistant / beside manner -
0 stars
Front office staff - 3 stars
Wait time -  3 stars
Cleanliness - 3 stars
Price - 3 stars

I would have given them a 3 star rating but the P.A. who was on duty seemed to have a very poor attitude. Also, I feel I was robbed $85  ( cash price with no insurance ) just for them to tell me I needed to see my family practitioner.

Waste of my time and money !</text>

The Urgent care was very busy and we did have a long wait, but they kept apologizing and said we would receive the same service as everyone else.  The doctor was excellent and took her time.  She gave my daughter meds to help her get better quick so we could continue to enjoy our vacation. I liked that the meds were available right there so we didn't have to locate a pharmacy.

<Text>I have never been treated so quickly and efficiently. I went in there in tons of pain for An untreated UTI. I had to work in less than an hour so I was already worried about having to call in. I was seen within 5 minutes of sitting down, got my vitals and the nurse addresses my issues. Doctor came in 3 minutes later, wrote my prescription, filled it right there and I was out. The whole thing was less than 30 minutes. I was very impressed and thankful!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The facility is wonderful, parking was easy and the rooms were incredibly clean. The receptionists and support staff were polite, friendly and professional. If that was the whole interaction I would leave five stars for just the facility and parking.

I take a SSRI daily and have been on the same dose for over 4 years. My previous prescribing doctor had written me a script to last one year because she was retiring and moving out of the country. Being new to North Hollywood and having this place right down the street I thought that I could start seeing a doctor here. The Dr. spent a total of about 15 seconds in the room, looked at the empty Rx bottle I had brought with me and wrote me a 30 day script. The only question he asked was why I was there. It just seemed very impersonal and im pretty sure I will not be returning to this place any time soon< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c295f26f766061:0xbc02e3f4c4c9f1d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I was not seen by a doctor but didn't know until I looked at the prescription to see the doctors assistant.  When she came in she did not introduce herself and she did not prescribe me the proper dosage of medication.  I'm having a relapse and no one returns my call.  They say I have to come in again and pay again, which doesn't seem fair.  My first time going to an urgent care, was not a good one.  Make sure you ask if they are a doctor before treatment.  I sure will.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

*Only gave one star because I could give zero*

My boyfriend went in for pain near the gallbladder. Ran a couple tests. One nurse missed his vein TWICE, & didnt feel he could do it so he had to call in someone else.

"No big deal, he's probably a rookie" I thought. But also, let's be honest, how are people rookies supposed to get experience if they dont start with actual people.

Outside in the hallway we heard our PA (physicians assistant) joke saying, " Nooob!
Not the MOST professional thing but I will admit, it was pretty funny.

But i digress. We were told they would schedule an ultra-sound in the morning along with the results for the tests they took the day before.

So we get a call in the morning about the appointment for the ultrasound. We went to the hospital, had the ultrasound, and was told they would send the results back to the urgent care facility.

Cool.

So..... Hours go by ... Nothing. We call, ask about the results, they say their waiting for the physician to review the results.

The entire day go by, we called every couple of hours or so due to the fact that he was in an EXCRUCIATING amount of pain ( that is not an exaggeration).

The very last call was around 8 or so, Nancy the receptionist was just HORRIBLE to us. We werent rude, we simply called to inquire if their had been any update and her ATTITUDE was IMMEDIATE .

Saying, "i have been on the phone with you all day."

Look I get it, you have been there all day, i dont know what kind of day you are having but that was NOT good bedside manner & unfortunately that was not ther end of her negative & snarky tone. I was nothing short of baffled.

You are dealing with people in immense pain & concerned families who were promised results. We are UNDERSTANDING of the fact that the results hadnt been reviewed. SYMPATHETIC to the fact that there is apparently only ONE physician taking on hundred of people a day as well as lots of paperwork & test results to review.

But what is NEVER ok is being short, rude, disrespectful, condescending & attitudinal to a patient who is basically whispering due to pain from breathing & speaking.

I was raised by a nurse, & this wasn't the decorum of a medical proffessional.<//review>

< Review>
My wife went here for a prescription refill.  This was after they refused to refill the rx of a general anti-anxiety medication over the phone.  They said she'd "have to come in for them to approve a refill". So she did. After the normal hour wait,  she saw a dr. The Dr. told her that they " can't keep refilling" her prescription and gave her only 2 weeks worth of medicine.  This would almost be ok if he didn't have a bad attitude and treat my wife like her medicinal need was a burden he didn't have time for.  Furthermore,  this office visit is she sure to cost at least to our insurance.  This is no way to treat a paying customer. We will not be returning to this urgent care even though the location is nice. Thanks Doc</Review>

If I could give it zero stars I would my significant other went there after I had been diagnosed with a minor std to see if I had transmitted it to him. He also was enquiring about a skin rash on his hands. The doctor not only did not test for an std she looked at his hands for 10 seconds and told him it was eczema. 1. He did have the STD and 2. It wasn't eczema. Don't go here incompetence and neglect is all you will get.<//Review>

Waste of time and co-pay. I went in with flu symptoms. Dr. Tarek requested flu test but he was informed that flu tests were backordered so he then ordered a strep test be administered (which came back negative) and he prescribed me an antibiotic and said if i get worse to come back. I was able to see another doctor the same day who diagnosed me with the flu and was able to prescribe proper meds.<//Review>

I am disappointed every time I come here. There is a major lack of communication between the physicians.
Whether I'm here to refill a prescription or for a serious infection or illness, no one is able to help me within a week's time.
Save your money. Save your time. Go somewhere else.< /Review>

Very unprofessional. They have payed staff and students. It looks like the students know more then the staff. Also i was in waiting room and staff was discussing patients medical problems and that just grossed me out.<//Text>

Backpacker from Europe here. I got a recommendation from some locals in Sonora to come here. It was already very late when I arrived to this RV park and I had no place to stay, so I really didn't think it's a crime to pitch a tent in RV park. At 7 am got wakened up by crappy looking guy, who threatened to call police if I don't leave immediately. I explained I had no bad intentions and offered to pay for a stay with no respond. Maybe I was wrong, maybe didn't know rules or regulations, but this felt a bit of overkill at least.My late arrival to this place was not planed as it happened because I had to cancel my hiking trip from Lake Tahoe to Yosemite due to snow conditions in High Sierras. Luckily, I met plenty of nice people on my way, who gave me rides to come back to San Francisco as there was no public transportation in Sonora area. By the way, the guy who kicked me out from camping, looked like somebody who would get kicked out from many places himself.</review>

Great food and service.
I went there with 2 other Colombian friends. We had a great time. The food was delicious and not very expensive. Besides food you will also find fruit juices and deserts.
If you are looking for Colombian food, this is the place to go!< /text>

<Text>Trust your eyes...this restaurant is very low budget. This interiors is old and the place is worn down. The best part of my meal was the chips (salsa was really bad) and beer. My tacos were greasy and messy. Very low quality. The service was good and the staff was friendly..<//Text><rating>1</rating>< gmap_id>

The services is horrible ... waiting in the table for 15 minutes while the place was almost empy, it was  just two busy tables. A few employees just looked at us from the distance and nothing happened. I didn't give the opportunity to try the food.< /Review>

<review>I’ve passed by this spot so many times. I had lunch there many years ago when my company was headquartered down the street. But it’d been years. So today, I passed the lines at wonderful Luna and unique Zona Rosa, both on the Alameda in San Jose. I finally ventured in to this restaurant and was not disappointed. The young ladies serving are attentive and hard working. The dishes are obviously prepared with care and attention. It took a while to get my veggie burrito. In the mean time, the attentive young lady brought me a few chips and salsa. The salsa was ok for pouring over my burrito but lacked substance for the chips.
When the burrito arrived it was quite fresh and tasteful. For $6.99 it was well worth the wait. Next time I’ll try the margarita.</review><Resp>{'time': 1558237801767, 'text': 'Thank you!'}</Resp></record>

< Review>
Overpriced and terrible quality food. The place is run down and can use a touch up not just another coat of paint ontop of the already old dust. $30 for 4 empanadas and 2 sodas. Are you wanting to go out of business? The place was empty at a rush hour lunch time. Should have been a sign. Stay away.</Review>

I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce. I got chicken with red sauce. I ordered it chimichanga style(fried) with flour tortillas. If they couldn't do it that way I said with corn tortillas. Needless to say I have soggy flour tortillas. The menu stated with sour cream.. There's no sour cream..  What's the deal? The restaurant wasn't that busy to make such huge mistakes. The last time I came here I ordered a $10 sangria thinking it had alcohol in it.. There wasn't any alcohol at all. A drink that size would have gone straight to my head...
With that being said... I won't bw going back to that place again.</review>

Waitress was very nice. The food wasn't really good and the portion size was very small. I ordered chicken flautas which are supposed to be hot but they poured some cold topping over it. Made for a sad night. Had to grab fast food when headed back to hotel.</review>

<text>Chips weren’t super fresh but the salsa was good.
Service: it was a little slow but there was only 1 girl that was getting drinks, waiting, and cleaning tables. Considering she was all alone I think she did good.

Food: The quesadilla, the super taco, and the chili relleno were all really good. We were pleasantly surprised.</text>< pictures>

<rate>3<//rate><review>Can't post a review about the food since we didn't try anything from the food menu. We were just there for a couple of drinks. Service wise was good only because of the two young ladies that were also assisting us. The other older server was super rude and made us feel uncomfortable or perhaps even unwelcome. Drinks are good but expensive. We got about six beers and the check was about $80.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The waiter wasn't very accommodating. The whole restaurant is a bit old and dirty. And the meat on the food was quite chewy.</Review>

We came in for a late dinner. The waitress gave us a delicious sample of the soup. Everyone was courteous... but I had 2 margaritas, and my husband also had a drink. They were either severely watered down, OR no alcohol at all. I didn't eat any food, so if both margaritas had 2 shots of taquilla like the menu said they did, I would have had a great buzz on.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Very disappointed with this.  They apparently don't have a/c cuz when I got there the entrance door was propped open.  There were several fans going, but the thought of all those flies coming in was scary.  Sign said "Please seat yourself" so I did.  No one ever came with water or a menu!  Finally, maybe 20 minutes later, my companion arrived.  Menus finally came as we kept saying "I want to order."  There were 6 parties, none big, & 3 waitresses.  Deplorable service.  We both ordered the empanadas & sangria & asked for water.  Empanadas arrived, no sangria or water.  They appeared to be deep fried & were very dry.  When we were halfway thru, sangrias finally came.  Water never came.  Their prices are quite high, quality of food & service low, so I won't be back.  I frequent a few other Mexican restaurants--food & prices much better, so I'll continue to patronize them.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Sad to say ...quality of food was poor the wet burrito was diced up steak mostly nerve from the meat...the 7 mares soup was not fresh you can tell the broth was greasy and probably fridge for a week.... and ugh no flavor...enchiladas suizas were not tastful it was bland and thick paste ,and the camarones a la diabla were made like a soup instead of a sauce,watery.... prices for these plates were 13.99 to 17.99 ...oh my goodness it seems like the ceiling falling apart ,the restaurant floor was dirty... bathroom doors were black wood painted doors the soap was watered down, literally no soap only water, our waitress was not attentive which sucks .I really expected better especially since its in a
Higher end of town... Im really surprised that they still have a license..GORDON RAMSEY from Hell's kitchen should pay them a visit...REALLY GHETTO...</text>

Not a good place to eat very ×25000 horrible  services. Not a good place to recomend for a family or two person dinner . No bueno 😠😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😠😠😠😠😠😠. I am a mad mexican woman and this is not close to a real mexican restaurant.  Not even one bit. Ugh so not recomendable. Ush not good .ugh we only get one SMALL cup of water . They have no refills.  I was very thirsty but they didn't care to do any refills  of FREE WATER . Ugh no bueno.</Text>

I'm going to be honest the first time I went I didn't like it probably because I just wasn't feeling it that day but I went on Mother's Day with my family &' the food was amazing. It did take a long to get our orders but bits because the owner of the restaurant actually makes the food, right in front of you, with someone helping him on the side so of course it will take a while for your food to come. It is a bit slow, the waitresses do take long but it's not a total rip-off. It's really worth the wait.<//Review>

Bad customer service.
Did not offer us the menu for Columbian food.
After we placed our order they came back like 20 minutes later to tell us they don’t have what we ordered. Also the food wasn’t even good. I tried the chilaquiles and they were the worst I’ve ever had. I Woulda had a better experience at McDonald’s.<//text>

Ordered a Margarita & a beer for my husband and I, went upstairs to use the restroom before we were about to order food, and lost my appetite. The women's restroom was gross as were the Gents.
And After experiencing this it spoke for the restaurants kitchen.
Perfect location wonderful staff disgusting to eat here<//text>

Great Mexican food!!!! I ordered steak a la mexicana and it was spicy delicious!!!! Fresh jalapeños, homemade red spicy sauce with tender and lean steak chunks!!! Then the rice pretty fluffy and the refried beans tasty not oily at all!!! Highly recommend this place!!!!< /Review>

<text>Pretty sure the worst Mexican food I've ever ate before,  paper thin carne asada,  salsa smells and taste next to vomit. Dishes came out 1 plate at a time, close to finish when tortillas fine showed up. Pass it up.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Food was alright. There were 5 people in here and it took the waitress about 20 minutes to take our order for drinks and food. Probably another 30 minutes to get our drinks and 10 more for food. with only 5 people here, wow service sucks. Her 2 kids were also running around the whole place. Won't recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Mexican, it is a Colombian restaurant. The hotel is located next to the hotel, and it stayed here for about 5 days when we stayed. I sometimes heard Colombian live songs at night. There are many unusual dishes for Japanese people, so I can enjoy it so much. However, people from Latin America are predominantly the guests, so Oriental people may float a little.

(Original)
メキシカン、コロンビア料理屋です。隣にホテルが併設されており、ここに5日間程、泊まった際に利用しました。夜にたまにコロンビア系の方々の生歌が聴けました。料理は中々日本人には珍しいものが多々あり、そこそこ楽しめます。ただ、利用客は圧倒的に中南米の方々がメインなので、東洋人は少し浮くかもしれません。</review><Rating>4</Rating><GmapID>0x808fcb728b9d7a1f:0xcdc2a4bdd19bc260<//GmapID><username>Yusuke Shinoda<//username>< user>

<text>This is easily the most confusing and janky building on campus. The floor which most people enter on is the fifth, but there is bizarre catwalk like exits on the third and others. All of the interior hallways reek of 1960s. I'd rate it lower but go UCLA engineering.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bc8632b4bcf3:0x8087319fe00f1e04< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>While severely janky, unmodern, and totally confusing to navigate, Boelter Hall is essential to the undergraduate UCLA engineering experience. Many engineering classes are held there and engineering students will grow to love the building and memorize all of the cool spots, from the Seaslabs to the lower floors where projects take place.< /Review><time>1550968113002<//time><response>None< /response></record>

< Review>
This building can be quite confusing at times. For instance, entering the east side of Boelter puts you on the fifth floor, while another entrance puts you on the second. The fact the building is also connected to the Math Science building doesn't help either.<//Review>

There is usually terrible or non-existent WiFi here which is ironic because it is home to the Computer Science department.<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The structure is nothing exceptional..but in this building there is the room where the first internet connection in history took place .. inside 3420. For technology enthusiasts I think it is a must! The room can be reached from the back and the interior can also be seen because the door is with glass.

(Original)
La struttura non è niente di eccezionale..ma in questo stabile c'è la stanza in cui è avvenuto il primo collegamento internet della storia..all' interno 3420. Per gli appassionati di tecnologia penso sia un must! La stanza si raggiunge dal retro e si possono vedere gli interni anche perché la porta è con il vetro.</review><user>116149098309829696839</user></record>

This glass door hasn’t been sliding and not working at all. I have contacted the office more than 4 times and they say it will be fixed in a few days. This glass door almost fell on my three old sister. The office only cares about getting paid but they don’t care about their residents. I don’t recommend living here at all!!!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><review>From a frequent guest point of view.  I was pleasantly surprised how much this complex has to offer.  Love the apartment layouts and the tranquility of the grounds. From the running creeks and bridges to the work out area to tennis courts.  I visited at both the day time and evening and found the grounds peaceful & the staff helpful. and although I live in a 3k square space I could certainly appreciate the quaintness of this complex & how well it is maintained.  Two thumbs up & 5 stars.< /review>< pics>

The office staff always tell you that there is plenty of parking but that's a bold lie. If you come home late from work then you will have to park your car far away from your apartment. They are not quick in sending a handyman to fix any problem that you might have. Don't waste your money on this apartment....<//review>

<review>Awful place...infested with roaches and mice...My wife spend two hours standing on the couch because of a mouse in the apartment and I called the office to help her but they just hung up on me and no one came..Please don't waste your money renting an apartment there. The countertops are very impractical and the heater is not working and the air conditioner is too loud. They are very nice until you sign the contract. Once this is done, they ignore your complaints completely. Unfortunately, I'm stuck there and can't leave until my contract is over.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd27bbcd79b6a5:0x378b3ce236516dbe< /gmap_id></record>

Me and my girlfriend lived here for a year and sadly had to move because we needed more space after having a baby. However, living here was an amazing experience. Sandra in the office was my favorite and I could go to her whenever i had a request or had any issues. Thank you guys for providing such a beautiful apartment and wonderful community! Highly recommend!!< /text>

I have been living here for 2 months and this place has been the best experience when it comes to renting apartments.  The entire leasing office staff is very professional and provides the best service.  The facilities are well kept by the maintenance crew.  And its location is perfect for going out to eat and nearby freeways.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

Soild place to live. I was looking for apartments not more that a day and I found this apartment after having gone to see the ones next door. As soon as we walked in Kacey helped us get the apartment pretty much all in the same day. If we had brought our pay stubs that day we would have moved in even sooner. After everything it's our second day here and we could not be happier with the place way better than staying with the parents. For our first place I'd say it's pretty nice not far from the beach or mall (on top of that the second floor apartments have a high ceiling which sounds awesome with surroundsound speakers btw). There's other negative reviews are probably people who've been evicted and or think this is a hotel just fyi.<//Review>

I don't live here, but i had a walkthrough of available units. they took my driver's license, and never gave it back. i didnt realize it until after their offices were closed and i was out of town. on calling them to have them mail it to me, they made it very difficult and i had to speak to 2 different people. they never mailed me my drivers license (after over a week) after asking 2 different people for them to do so. whether or not living there is good or not, they employ some very shady people. who knows what they are doing with my drivers license?</review>

Very diverse, college students, families, etc. Lots of kids that hang out together as well as leaf blowers 4 days a week. It is a very large complex so there are the same problems that come with every large community. Comfortable and well located is my best description.< /Review>

We had a horrible experience living in this community. Thanks to the management. We kept complaining about finding rat poop and food getting spoiled because of the rats in the fourth month of our lease. They did nothing in spite of our regular complaining. They left rat traps on the kitchen cabinet and didn't even bother to keep it at suspicious places (under sink) that we repeatedly mentioned. 3 months later we found two big rats dead under the kitchen sink with a time difference of one month. We spoke to the management on releasing us from the lease and it's been 6 months since we lodged our first complaint. We are still struggling to get released. To them money matters more than ones safety. Just stay away from this disgusting management and this infested community. I wish I had a zero star rating. And I wish I could I upload pictures and show the severity of the situation to you all.</text>

The worst apartments to live in by far! When they first take you through the apartment complex they have a nice model home that they show you to try and convince you to live there but once you move in to the actual apartment you are given it is absolutely trash. Absolutely the worst management i have ever seen.</Text>

It’s a beautiful complex and nice neighborhood. Otherwise,
Not safe.. things get stolen in a blink of an eye because anyone can enter the complex.
Maintenence sometimes don’t even come upon request.
Laundary not working for a couple ot times.
Swimming pools are dirty.
Gym is hot no AC in the summer.
& Most importantly, management is very materialistic and ununderstanding.< /text>

Would like to share my experience of living in Cinnamon Creek for 1 year I  would highly recommend not living here as of right now there have been police comming into cinnamon creek more frequently because of thieves. My motorcycle got stolen couple of months ago and all they could do is " we will give patrol a call " which by the way is never around . As well as my father equipment was stolen amd that was valued at 600 dollars. There has been more tagging in the apartments complex which management delegates to their patrol which again is never around. The managers sell u on the fact that security is a big deal to them which is not

Privacy
Living in cinnamon creek you will hear your neighbors amd all the actions they are doing all of them. If you have loud neighbors you will hear everything they do until they decided to stop. Record proof because that is what it will take inorder for them to do anything about it

Summer time
Living in cinnamon creek during the summer was brutal I got stuck near a pool area and all up into 1 am on the weekdays kids and adults  would be at the pool area  past when the pool closed which is 10 pm. It took about 30 to 50 people of constant compalining for management to do something about which show how "relibale" their patrol is.  if you are a hard working adult to meet rent stay away from this place it is an overpriced unsecured apartment complex with all the issues stated above there have been others who regret living here dont be one of then< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>It has been fair for a period of time but nowadays we are living the worst period ever, The management is careless I don't know if the new manager is trying to reduce the costs and show profits or is he not capable of managing such a big community. Where should I start? Shall I start with the tenants who are noisy all the day or the pools and the hot tub which have never been clean. Or the delayed maintenance and the worst materials that they are using. Or the unbelievable increase in rents which is not matching the market prices of the area.
I have a pregnant wife who has been taking cold showers for the last 5 days because there's no warm water (which is illegal). I have been trying to go to the lease office but the staff weren't there in the office times for 3 consecutive days, And when we try to reach them via the phone we receive the worst treat ever where the staff are very rude talking to us. Even though when I tried to call the emergency number (Arnel management) today, they promised that they will send someone to repair the hot water but no one has tried to solve the issue.
No wonder why people are leaving this dirty place.</review>< Pictures>

<date>1384811751963</date><Name>Jessica Labidi<//Name><pics>None</pics><Review>This is the very first apartment that my husband and I lived in, we thought when we moved in we were getting a good deal with their move in special.  The time we lived here was from November 2012 to October 2013. However, after a few months of living here we noticed all over our apartment there was mold growing; from our bathroom to the windows in our bedroom, kitchen, even on our refrigerator.  A month after we had moved in the Manager at the time had mentioned to me one evening that if we had seen any mold to let her know immediately, at that time I did not because we had just moved in and they had cleaned and covered it before we moved in.  So when we started to see mold growing I went straight to the office Manager, but at this point the Manager before had already left, and a new one had come in to replace her.  The new management was very unprofessional and did not take our issue seriously, she walked over to our place took a look around and said she would get maintenance to come and paint over what was coming through the walls.  This did not solve our issue, and on top of this my husband and I started to suffer from allergies from the mold, and my husband started to develop asthma attacks, especially at night, we both had difficulties sleeping in the apartment.  We complained again, and once again Management ignored our complaints, telling us that is was the weather changing even though this lasted for almost a year, and they told us to spray bleach on our walls.  Finally when our lease was up, we were ready to move, we could not wait to get out of this horrible place.  They made it appear like a decent place to live, but on the inside, it is miserable, do not sign a lease with ARNEL Management.  On top of this when we moved in we paid $650 for our deposit and they basically take it all when you move out, and we cleaned the apartment the best we could before we left.  Once my husband and I moved out, after a week a not breathing in that apartment my husband no longer was sneezing every day, coughing at night, having shortness of breathes and having asthma attacks, so I know it was not the weather, but the mold in the apartment.  When we moved out the maintenance had told us that the carpet had been in that apartment for 7 years, and every year they just paint over everything, and the appliances had not been upgraded for more than at least 10 years.  Cinnamon Creek and Arnel Properties are a joke, and should be shut down because the living conditions that are life threatening.</Review><resp>{'time': 1552494239736, 'text': 'Thanks for sharing your feedback.

<Text>Worst mangement ever! Maureen always says "ok whats your number so I can call you right back." Does she? Nope! Never ever calls back! There is so much turnover. The only consistent person is Katie and she is rude. I hate this place thanks to the crappy management. I have complained many times about a damn tarp on my balcony spoken to Maureen and my husband even called AND we have complained in person, too and they havent had my downstairs neighbor take down the ugly blue tarp they stapled to the bottom of my balcony! I have termite damage on my balcony and they know about it....did they send someone? Nope! This place sucks...period.</Text><Rate>2</Rate><userid>103273911969140136964< /userid></record>

If you wanna live with black beetles and snacks, rent this apartment. Even though we talked too many times to the office, and they came to sprayed chemical too many times, it still appears black beetles in my room. We've lived here for over 1 year but the office can't solve this problem for us!
Today snack got into my room!< /Text>

<text>I talked to the office about the package that I was told was dropped off w them the day before. They told me it wasn't there which thats fine but they gave me the "We don't see anything belong to you here" attitude. After being on the fone w the website service rep, I told the those ladies that the shipper will stop by later to find out where my package is, the "newbie" gave me another "That's fine w us, do whatever u want, good luck" look! So I walked out and the other lady ran out after me and yelled "WE DONT STEAL UR PACKAGE,  WE DO NOT STEAL UR PACKAGE...!!" with a b*tchy attitude. Ok.... how professional.... ?!<//text>< Gmap_id>

I Moved to this apartment in Sept 25 2011. I was so please with the price and the location. It seems right at the moment. Within 2 weeks, they are banging on my door saying i still owe for a deposit since I moved in on the 25th rather the first. Well the Mgr I talked to initially already gave me a price and we averaged that cost already in, however i couldn't prove it so I was forced to pay.

If that was not enough, my daughters got flea bites all on her legs when we moved in. Two week later, i get termites. The come and fix the flea and termites. Now a few weeks later, i get roaches. After they get rid of the roaches, then I get water Beatles. I was soo done with that place.

My final straw was when one way spike at the end of the gate poped my tires and they refused to fix it.

Just like the guy before me, i caused no damange to my apartment and they gave me $16 back...wow....do not waste ur time here.</Review>

They used to take pride in their product,but now just rush you out and the sand which makers are usually in a bad mood. Togo’s used to be the best sandwich in town..not anymore< /Text>< Pictures>

TOGO’S makes delicious food; this location is touch and go. Their new system is efficient when Brandon is on the register, but otherwise quite ineffective. The staff seem to struggle with following health codes with hair dangling, unclean clothing, and untucked shirts. However, the restaurant is exceptionally clean and spacious—as far as TOGO’S goes.  TODAY:  The receipt on my order said “12: 02p,” but I didn’t receive my salad until 12:22p. I watched the manager make my salad. He is a taller gentleman, so every time he reached for an item I watched his untucked shirt fall and rest in my salad. I mentioned this sanitation issue while he made my salad and then specifically told him that I watched his shirt go in my food multiple times. He asked if I wanted him to remake the salad, but because I waited so long for the salad I told him “I would prefer if you just tucked in your shirt, so you’re not dipping your shirt in everyone else’s food.” He rolled his eyes and resumed making other people’s food with his shirt flopping into sandwiches and salads. I recognize the generic response will be “see you next time,” but I honestly don’t know if I’m going to return to this location.< /Text>

However, it never gets old and I am consistently impressed by how they can deliver a fantastic sandwich experience time in and out over and over again. It seems to me that they rarely ever waiver from the quality of their sandwich and the formula that they have landed upon in terms of quality of meat, amount of veggies, size of bread etc is in an age old proven composition that never fails to satisfy. Treat yourself to a Togo's sandwich and I'm sure he'll return for more.<//text>< Pics>

Got a farmers garden salad and asked for pepperochinis on the side.  They didn't put them on the side but I didn't see any in the salad either, however my salad was pepperochini spicy like they had put the juice in the salad.  Couldn't eat most of the salad  because it was too spicy for me!</review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I give this place a solid 5. Customer service was absolutely great. I was in line and each customer was being addressed as smoothly as possible. When my turn came up, I was greeted with a smile and my sandwich was briskly made. The manager handled everything with ease and great care. The sandwich tasted excellent. And they have one of those new automated soda machines which is a great plus. Employess seemed like they were attentive and enjoyed the work. My experience was so good I even came back a second time just to absorb the atmosphere of the shop. All I bought was a drink and a brownie but it was well worth the visit. I am definitely planning on going back, forget Subway.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>If I could give negative 3 stars I would.
I am very unhappy with the service and product I received today.
I asked for a simple request for my sub,  and instead I was given a look by the woman making my sub as if I was wasting her time.
Once I received my sub I left. I should have looked at the sandwich before leaving the store .  LOOK AT YOUR SANDWICH BEFORE LEAVING.  So that they can fix any mistakes before you leave.

I'm leaving this nasty review along with complaining to management in the morning. If you can avoid this Togo's location please do so. You will save yourself money and time.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

<Review>I had a bad experience there the last time I was at the U.City. Togo's I asked for a sandwich #26 to have no onions & no peppers and easy mustard and they gave me a #26 w/onions and no  tomatoes and they put a hole lots of mustard I took the onions back up to the counter and asked for tomatoes........ I think they just lost a customer at their store and maybe from Togo's  completely.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This place used to be good until they changed their ordering process. Now you have to order everything at once on a machine that hyperly prints out orders to the sandwich workers before you've even finished choosing your toppings. I won't be going to Togos again despite over a decade of patronage.<//Text>

I recieved an email for free birthday togos sandwich and was pretty stoked. This is another hit or miss place for me though and this last time was a miss for me. I ordered a chiken salad sandwich and was surprised when I got home to find that my sandwich had more bread than salad. 3 stars are for the mediocre customer service, mind you this was on a monday afternoon not busy at all. and for the free meal deserves my rating of 3 stars. the fact that there was hardly any chiken salad and mainly bread made me deduct two stars. Im just thankful that even though the sandwich was meager, it was still free. Cause had I paid, well that would be another story lol<//review>

Very bad experience here. No credit and trust to this store. I came to do Uber inspection earlier Saturday. They said I needed to replace tie rod.but I didn't have time that day. They told me  I could finish anywhere once it's done They would give me pass. After my friend store helped me fixed the part with oil change in my friend's place and I came to finish inspection they still didn't pass it and said I needed to replace another part. they didn't refund my fee. They just tried to find tiny issues on the car and trying to fix them charging for high labor fee. They have no respect on you. They took my car's plate photos without my permit secretly. They don't have patience to serve customers.</review>

<date>1596248137214</date><rate>3<//rate><Text>UPDATE: I received amazing customer service that addressed my concern as well as fixed the problem. I adjusted my original 2 stars to 3 stars-- I would've given it 4 but I can't say I'll be back.

Disappointing experience. When I payed they told me they had vacuumed my floorboards but when I got in my car it was very clear that they hadn't vacuumed them (I'll attach pictures.) I waited almost 2 hours for this! I know this is a small problem but it leads to a bigger one of trust. I would like to trust the person working on my vehicle. If the person working on my car told me they did something but they didn't do it, now I've lost trust in the quality and thoroughness of their service. What else did they say they did but they didn't actually bother to look at? They charged me $70 for this (mediocre) synthetic blend oil change service. It's almost like they were so busy trying to upsell me on brake packages and belt replacement that they forgot to do the things that came with the PACKAGE I PAID FOR. I will NEVER come back here< /Text>< Pics>

Our keys were ready to go and the car was done and she was just chit-chatting wasting 15 minutes of my time. Talking about how chipotle hurt her mouth.

<Text>I'm actually getting my oil change done right now on my Colorado and the guy, Tim, who is helping me is probably the best service guy I've ever had. I usually go to Valvoline but I saw a coupon online today for $20 off and valvoline wouldn't price match so I came here, pretty glad I did. I didn't have to get out of my car which was super cool and got everything I needed done. I didn't even mind spending more than at valvoline because this guy was so nice. This guy is super on point with everything. Extremely friendly and knows his stuff. Customer service is A+++.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I needed to get my annual car inspection done for Uber when I took my car in I was told that my car needed over $600 worth of work and a license plate bulb replaced which is why my car failed to pass which other than a bulb being replaced I knew was bogus so I was charged anyways. I toik my car to a different Company where my car passed with flying colors. Since this Covid hat hit I haven't worked in months and having to pay for not one but two inspections is a task. I am very disappointed in Jiffy Lube and will never return. taking advantage of us rideshare driver's during this difficult time is not acceptable. I will be reporting them to Uber as well.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1602556018354, 'text': "Hi Debra, Providing high-quality, honest, and trustworthy service is what we strive for with each visit, and I apologize that you haven't received this.

<Review>Took so long just for a basic oil change. Can see the employees talking and messing around without any of them working on the cars. Told them I was in a hurry and just wanted my oil changed, still tried to convince me to get a million other things fixed right now, and after being here OVER AN HOUR I see them washing my windows???? That’s nice but who asked????? When I say I’m in a hurry and just want my oil changed, I want someone who will respect that. Will not be returning here ever.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Took one of my cars in for an oil change because I got lazy and didn't want to do it myself at that moment. We were the only car in at the time and it took a while, but part of that is they had to jump the battery which the car DID have a bad battery. They DID NOT try to sell me anything I didn't need. Points for that. I would more worried if a business (that's supposed to make money) didn't try to up sell stuff. Making money is the purpose of business, I'm more concerned with how they do it and these guys didn't over do it.

After the oil change my keys were left on top of the car out of my line of sight (this is just bad S.O.P) rather than handing me the keys and with modern cars the proximity keys are still detected out to a certain distance. So we drove off thinking the keys were in a cup holder in the dark and the key fob and keys ended up sliding off the car and getting run over.

The manager Lauren and all of the guys there at 8:30pm went out of their way to find busted up keys on foot and sent a mobile locksmith to meet me to program a new key. Now of course you would expect them to rectify a mistake. But they really went above and beyond to make things right and that is saying something. I've worked with other shops in the past and they could have just as easily given me the run around and/or tried to scam their way out of it. But these guys owned their mistake and made it right.

From my experience how well a shop works is one thing, but how they handle their mistakes speaks volumes. So while my overall experience wasn't the greatest given the problem with the keys, credit has to be given for how they handled the situation.<//review>

i had a terrible experience for my car inspections at 2 liffy lubes: 1st, i waited over 1 hour to get my car inspected but finally i got a so-called  repair list including the replacement of 2 tires which i changed 1 month ago. then i went to the 2nd one, but they managed to ask my to prepare the form by myself otherwise, they could not do it because they dont have the forms?!....i left upset, disappointed with night mare feeling...<//review>

UPDATED REVIEW: 5 cars and 20 years loyalty. I came to this shop a little after 8a when they opened. I walked to the door and it was locked at 8:05a so I went to the bay where the older of 2 employees was swearing about something. He saw me and said nothing, another minute went on before I got "what can I help you with" with a I don't care attitude. Then a "give me time to get ready" at 8:05a when they should already be ready, right. There were 2 cars with people in them parked at the 2 closed bay doors assuming they have yet to be contacted yet and another man trying to get into the locked door. I will never go to this location again. Employees who do not like or know how to properly give customer service either need training or get promoted to customer. Fix your service please, as I with this exception like Jiffy Lube.<//Text>

Did take my car in for a check up and tune up. Not sure what happened but 2 weeks later my car stalled and would not move. I feel like this might have been a preventable issue if the car was thoroughly looked at.</review>

<Text>I took my car in for just a simple oil change and the employees at jiffy lube tried to charge be over two hundred dollars more. They brought out a ph test of my break fluid and my air filters and said that they needed to be changed. I refused everything but the break fluid because I'm a broke college student and there's no way I could have afforded what they wanted to charge me. When I sat down the same lady brought out what looked like the same stuff and gave the same speech verbatim to another customer. I did not appreciate the lady trying to get more money out of me even though it was obviously something I could not afford but it was obvious to her that I had never taken my car in for an oil change before. I will definitely never return to this jiffy lube, they can count on not having my business ever again.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1556315520763, 'text': "Hi Summer,\n\nProviding high-quality, honest, and trustworthy service is what we strive for with each visit, and I apologize that you haven't received this.

When it for an oil change and it took longer than expected. I really did not mind that, but the person attending me said there was plenty of things wrong with my car that would total about $780 or so dollars. She said I needed new breaks and flush my break fluid blah blah...funny thing is, I got that taken care of a month before I came here. I want spark plugs, the person said they would charge me $100 just for labor and $120 for the plugs. No thanks. Group on deal was okay so that’s the reason I came. Had it been not on group on, I wouldn’t have ventured into this place. I called someone to look at my car for a second opinion, he charged me $140 for an alignment, spark plugs and air filter. Pretty much a tune up. Also told me that everything Jiffy Lube mediocre mechanics said was not true and he didn’t charge me to check all those other issues that were said to me at jiffy. Well Jiffy, you don’t have a customer with me anymore. Don’t worry, you can con elderly, that is, if they don’t have Internet.< /text>

<Review>I was hesitant at first to visit this location since I have always gone to the Nissan dealership for my infinity. However, my tire light and service engine light came on on the day of my road trip up north. The dealership would have required my car for at least 3 hrs. So I decided to take a chance with this location instead. I was in and out in less than an hour for a tire plug and transmission service. Had my oil change too with $16.00 discount from the service. It was a busy Friday but the cars were moving in and out accordingly<//Review><UserId.>110488323487554261568< /UserId.><user_name>David Barrera</user_name>< Pictures>

Sitting in the waiting room watching as no one works on my car, then when they finish they move it out to a parking space but the cashier is on her cell phone and I have to wait for her to finish to pay and leave. Took a HOUR to change my oil! Very poor customer service and severely overpriced

Do not take your car here for anything! Long story short.... they broke my windshield. I called, emailed, and went back in and spoke to Luis the manager. He said he would take care of it....and a month later, still nothing. I call and he's "busy" can't talk, won't return my calls. Very unprofessional. Not a good company to do business with.< /Review>

I needed to get an oil change because it was really pasted due. I moved so the place usually would go to is to far now. I saw this place and decided to give it a try. What a great decision I made. The service was very professional and quick plus they explained everything my car needed in detail. I didn't have enough money to get everything so the manager gave me a coupon to use when I return. I went the next day. I'm really happy with the service and I feel confident in the work they did. This will be my new place now.<//Text>

< review>
Brought my vehicle in for brakes about a year ago and have done some business with Jiffy Lube in the past, at a previous location in LA Habra and also this location. I go there mostly for convenience or emergency. When I got my brakes serviced, the manager gave a business card with a free oil change. I had waited until I needed to use it and when the time finally came, it was a new manager who would not honor the oil change. Well, that's fine then I don't have to do business with you. How can you trust a company that doesn't honor what they say? The answer is, you don't trust them. I'll take my business elsewhere to a company that provides quality assurance to their customers and keeps their word. Another thing, their associate is calling me bro, I ain't your bro, this is about business.<//review>

Because Valvoline is even worse and there's not many options left! I was not happy  with my recent JiffyLube visit. They tried to convince me to get a $45 air cabin filter which I refused. Got one for $18 over at Autozone...but I discovered that the guy at JiffyLube placed the cabin filter back in UPSIDE DOWN! Large arrows on the filter clearly mark the filter's airflow direction. Careless or intentional (likely), unacceptable! This is unfortunate. They lost another customer.</Review>< Pics>

Oil change is ok but got my brakes and Rotors resurfaced they told me that I needed to replace my passenger control arms that bushings were worn out that was false and that they would charge me 300 to do the job. I've gone to two second opinions and they both said my control arms and bushings were fine one of those mechanics didn't charge me a penny to inspect as well. To top it off the brake tech that worked on my car gave me attitude because I was unhappy with his work and there a small scraping noise coming from the new brakes they installed, but with the bad service I received I don't even want bother coming back so in end they won Good job jiffy lube<//Text>

<text>The staff is very nice but There not true full.  Went in there for oil change before drive there and I was on low low. After oil change the guy said my oil was full but very dirty which both was a double lie. The guy never worked on my car. I ask him how do you know its was super dirty when you never work on my car and the guy that did has a oil pan that that goes right under the oil pan so you can see anything. But I was listening and they tell almost everyone the same thing and the try really hard to see you things or scare you that you need it. Like the deal states....... also 45 dollars for oil chances and up wow I might state going to other places soon<//text></record></dataset><record>

I had oil change done in my Toyota sienna here and this guy did very bad job as it was leaking oil, I was lucky found out right away as soon as I reached home. It could be disaster if I drove more. They promise in their signature service to vacume inside car and fill out all fluid which they did not perform on my van.
I went back to fix the oil leak they did it and promise me to give one free oil change and till now after 4 weeks they did not kept their promise. I will not go again and do not recommend any one to go their.< /Text>

THIS JIFFY LUBE IS THE WORST! I DONT WANT TO EVEN GIVE IT ONE STAR! WHEN WE GOT THERE WE WERE LIED TO LEFT AND RIGHT ABOUT WHO WAS IN CHARGE.ONE MANGER WHO WOULD NOT GIVE US HIS NAME WAS GIVING MY MOM THE RUN AROUND. THE MANAGER FREDDY OR OF THATS HIS REAL NAME HARRASED AND IGNORED MY MOM! ALL SHE WANTED WAS HER MONEY BACK BECUASE THEY FILLED HER OIL TO THE DANGER ZONE AND CRACKED HER OIL PAN. THEY SAID NO MONEY BACK AND TO LEAVE AND ALSO FOR ME NOT TO RECORD THEM BEING RUDE TO MY MOM. THEY WERE DOING THIS BECAUSE SHE IS AN ELDERLY WOMAN  AND THOUGHT HE COULD JUST BRUSH HER OFF.THEY ALSO REFUSED THE CORPRATE NUMBER. HE ALSO SIAD HE WAS GOING TO CALL THE COPS ON US IF WE DID NOT LEAVE. , SO WE DID THE SAME BECUASE OF HOW MY MOM WAS BEING TREATED.

ONCE HE SEEN ME CALL THE POLICE HE WANTED TO MAKE A DEAL. BUT ONLY WITH MY MOM. HE GOT MAD CAUSE I RECORDED HIM AND HE DID NOT WANT ME TO GO IN THE OFFICE AND SEE WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO MY MOM. I WENT IN BECAUSE MY MOM FELT THERTANED AND GOT VERY NERVOUS. I HAD TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS OK.HE GOT ALL UP IN MY MOMS FACE.

MY MOM IS A DIABETIC AND SHE DOSE NOT NEED THIS STRESS. HE WAS CHOOSING HER ON AND TRYING TO JUST GET HER TO LEAVE. THIS MANAGER IS NOT CAPABLE TO WORK IN CUSTOMER SERIVICE AT ALL!!!!

MY MOM WAS JUST EXPECTING A NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT TO BE TREATED LIKE DIRT.

THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THIS AT ALL!

SHE JUST WANTED TO GET HER MOMEY BACK FOR THE OIL.< /text>

< review>
guy that works there backed into my car at about 30 mph ,could only afford to give me $50 because it wasn't his car, wasn't insured, and probably belonged to someone getting their oil changed. It broke my bumper down the middle and took out both headlights, i have been able to drive at night for over 2 months now, thanks Cristian. Ive been using my car to visit my 89 year old mother while she heals from fracturing her femur. Im an unemployed veteran and if hes got the balls to take someone elses car for a joy ride he should have the money to back up the accident. Do him like he did me...fire him amd give him $50 to by a new car, get it insured, fix the problems that he just caused and fill it up with gas, ya Cristian $50. Ass<//review>

The website and door both say they open at 7am, yet here I am sitting outside at 7am in 39 degree weather without an employee in sight! Then finally a guy (who has been sitting in his car this entire time) walks up with keys and says "you here for an oil change? We'll be open in a few minutes" I say "you were supposed to open 20 minutes ago" and he says "we don't open until 8" ... That's not what the website OR the door say! TERRIBLE customer service.

DO NOT GO HERE.....STAY AWAY!!!!

I have some squeaky breaks, so it was recommended that I replace my front rotors (which were thin) , replace pads (which I knew to), oil change and replace a few other parts (spark plugs, wires etc)......all together costing $700.

Before leaving, the "break tech" states, "You will hear squeaking, that's normal, the rotors and pads are brand new, they need to break in".

The car is used for short distance travel and 3-times during the week. After "breaking it in" for 10 days or so...the squeaking is still there and a "humming noise" can be heard....not safe at all!!!!!

I bring it in today, thinking it would be an easy fix....NOPE!!!!! The "break tech" shows me my front caliper and points out "When you brought it in, this was not broken, it could have been weak and you must have did it.....I can give you a quote on the caliper."

My car never made this humming noise EVER. But after I took it in and they touched it, some how, the caliper decides to fail within a week??? They did something wrong, possibly mishandled my caliper/rotor when replacing and broke it. Further more,  they did not give a hoot about me being upset.

STAY AWAY!!!! A $700 JOB WILL NOW COST A $1,000!!!!! SHARING ON FACEBOOK AND YELP!!!!!</Review>

Interesting and free! But plan ahead I mean weeks ahead or they will sell out. St and by lines not too bad if you go early. The infinity light room too much hype not worth the wait.< /text>

< Review>
Roy Lichtenstein is one of my favorites.  So it was a joy to see so many of his pieces close up.  I also enjoyed Jeff Koons, Barbara Kruger, Kara Walker, Glenn Ligon and a host of others.  I especially like a piece by Cecily Brown.< /Review>

I didn't have tickets, so I came early (an hour and a half) on a Friday morning and waited. Admission is free so all you have to do is wait. I was second in line in the standby line. I signed up for the Infinity Room right when I went in. It was an hour and a half wait, so I explored the museum before my turn.</Text>

< Review>
This museum is great. I visited a Saturday and the entrance was free. I enjoyed a free tour on one of the exhibitions that was conducted by an art professor for free.
It's  a minimalistic but warm museum. It's the most relaxed museum I have visited.  I felt at home... The employees are very nice and welcoming.< /Review>

<Text>Bring an out-of-towner to The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA and they'll be impressed right away with the architecture - even the escalator and the elevator entail a unique appeal. And even if they aren't into contemporary art, they'll most likely be excited to get a few selfies with the larger, perhaps more recognizable, pieces.< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
Came here for the first time yesterday and had an absolute blast with my girlfriend! The staff were very attentive, friendly, and most importantly, HELPFUL. Wait time to get in took us about 2 hours (which was kind of painful), but it is all worth it when you get inside as you get almost all the time in the world with each piece (excluding the Upside Down House). If you've never been here before, I highly recommend this place if 1) you are trying to get great pictures for the feed and 2) for a mind-boggling time with the art presented!<//Review>

Temporary Contemporary as it was known before (I imagine) Geffen gave money. As with modern art some seems kooky. They have some nice pieces and some head scratchers.<//Review>

Nice place. I'm looking forward to when the construction is done. The book fair here is pretty fun, especially for the kiddos.</Text>

This museum was really nice, very simplistic so that you can focus on the work from the different artists. I liked that there were a bunch of people who worked for the museum who were there to help you if you had questions or to show you interesting aspects of the art work as well as talking about it with you in depth.</review>

<response>None< /response><review>Wonderful museum. The artists represented were inspiring. The staff was available to answer questions whenever information was needed. The museum's flow and curation has a beautiful movement, each exhibit seems to be presented in the most appropriate space. Thankful for the powerful relevance of the artists work. Great outdoor area to enjoy. Only suggestion would be that the entrance was hard to find from the sidewalk. Maybe even using better signage to direct pedestrians around to enter through the parking lot might help. First time visiting during their free weekend event. Excited to make a return visit!<//review>< Pics>

Beautiful exhibits, it's fascinating to see the art blended into such a architecture. The building is so old and well build. Like a old warehouse, weather proof, like  military bunker.</Text>

<Text>They could do a lot more with this space. Barbara Kruger, still, again, over and over.  I think a lot more interesting artists have “emerged” that could use the opportunity. But ehi, ‘museums’ always a few steps behind. Still with Warhol, Rauschenberg and Rothko. Enough!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Fabulous date place, very calm and surreal, and Geffen Contemporary at MOCA doesnt disappoint. Phenomenal exhibits and contemporary art that will blow you away. I highly recommend this museum, absolutely stunning.</Review>

The Geffen has some interesting installations and artwork. It's part of the MOCA, so I was happy to see these two museums in a day for $15 usd (includes both). I think that's very reasonable for the amount of work you get to see. It's also nice to walk across town through Little Tokyo to get the other museum.

The Moca was a little less interesting. There was not as much to see. However, it's still worth the trip.</Review>

Paid $8 admission with a Student ID. On a rainy Wednesday afternoon the museum was very quiet and peaceful with few visitors. Two artists were featured in the exhibits I saw. This I appreciated, as it gives one a fuller picture of the artist's style, interests, and thoughts. Also, for those who use public transportation, it's easily accessible via the metro gold line.<//text>

Lovely collection on display.  I enjoyed my visit and the collections and pieces on display.  At the time I went, many of the works on display were political in nature.  I'm good with political but at some point it just becomes too much and begins to cross the line into creative propaganda.</review>

<Text>Great exhibition space in Little Tokyo.  The galleries are larger in scale than the downtown location of MOCA, allowing for more diversity in the exhibitions.  No permanent collection at the Geffen, so check the website to see what's on view.  Exhibitions vary in quality and scope.  Note that a ticket bought at the Geffen will also get you into the downtown branch the same day, and vice versa.</Text>< pics>

Very interesting! If you buy a ticket to the MOCA dtla, it also gets you into this MOCA as well. It was a unique experience. It's very dark so wear flat shoes. The employees have flash lights for areas with steps but you should still walk slow. The exhibit itself was cool too! Definitely a must see!</text>

The art is really cool and I'm glad I went, but for a building that size, the amount of art felt little. They could have definitely used the space better to add more. I finished the entire wall around and observed every image in about 20 minutes.. and yes I take the time to observe images. I dont just scroll through like an Instagram post.< /Text>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>It is a nice space, although smaller than I initially imagined, which is not always a bad thing. I found the space light, airy and manageable. There is a huge main room with a smaller offshoot room and a separate section if you cross the reception area. The staff are helpful and friendly and the collections interesting and varied.
Take time to sit outside and enjoy the sculpture and space, as well as visit the shop which is full of visual delights and easy to part with cash there.<//Text>< pictures>

For a museum that has a whole wall with the inscription "no more boring art", I feel you are falling short. A room with only a row of several suitcases. Another with a sawed-off tree that is bolted back together and supported with metal bracket, and yet another with a derelict aluminum wreck of a tracker in another room, leaves me wondering about no more boring art. Please!< /text>

Museum of Contemporary Art is awesome! Me and my husband stopped by in this museum and we really had fun watching their art collections they are really interesting and impressive. Actually that was our first time to visit the museum but we never regret it because it was never boring. The only problem is the parking area but once you get to the inside of the museum you will forget the parking hassle.<//Text>

<review>This will be difficult to review, if you like this type of art then go for it but you were wandering around like me and accidentally walked into this museum you'll probably be confused on how this industrial looking  building is being used in the most bare bone sense to pass off as a museum. You will leave contemplating on what you saw is "art" but perhaps that is a victory for the museum.<//review>< Pictures>

it is a great place to walk around! It was smaller than I expected and for me 2 hours are very plentiful for the whole visit. It is truly modern arts and hard to comprehend sometimes but it will take u to another world of wonders and unrealness. Very good getaway.<//Review>

I came here to see the Douglas Atkins exhibit.

The exhibit space is set in a revamped warehouse located in Little Tokyo.

There was an array of mediums such as film, sculptures and photography all from one artist.

I'm definitely looking forward to exploring the other MOCA locations.</text>

The idea of The Geffen sounded a lot better than it actually turned out to be with the described converted historic warehouse space. From the moment we entered the difficult to figure out entrance to be ignored by the staff who acted inconvenienced that we were trying to pay admission, we knew that we were not going to enjoy this museum. While some of the artwork was interesting and thought provoking, most tried too hard to be different and came across as either extremely sadistic or as boring as a library bookshelf. Next time I venture near Little Tokyo, the Geffen at MOCA won't be on my agenda.< /review>

We attended the exhibition of Adrián Villar Rojas: The Theater of Disappearance and had the chance to jump into a free guided tour. This former police car warehouse is huge and perfect for this kind of monumental installations. For this particular event, visitors had to walk in the darkness and explore the artworks with their phone lights, super exciting!< /text>

Who said LA doesn't do art? Excellent video installation by Doug Aitken (worth checking out), great space, large enough to keep you enthralled and entertained for several hours. Free between 5-8pm< /Text>

The museum is not big. I have liked more the Laura Owen's exposition  than the Zoe Leonard's.<//review>

Always enjoy visiting the Geffen Contemporary. Visit the 442nd War Memorial that is just steps away. There is a free shuttle that goes to the DTLA MOCA that stops here, how convenient!<//Text>

Call me old fashion but if  I will date someone, it will definitely here in this museum.. There is a catch walking and getting to know in a sweet ambiance like here in The Museum of Contemporary of Art. Awesome experience :D< /text>

Went on a free interactive tour and the facilitator holly was such a joy to have.  She was enthusiastic and knowledgeable as well.

<Review>The Museum is lovely and the art was very enjoyable but the young lady working in the ticket booth as well as the persons manning the desk when you enter were so unwelcoming that I will NEVER return to this location, better off at the Getty. I actually apologized to the girl in the ticket booth who was so obviously annoyed that she had to help customers she rolled her eyes. Very disappointed with the service.<//Review><Rate>2< /Rate>< date>

<Text>The museum has two location.  This one, The Geffin, is situated near a Japanese influenced area, little Japan, it has currently a wonderful exhibit by a talented scupture, creative use of space, innovative lighting, knowledgeable staff.  One fee (seniors $10.00) covers both sites with, in our opinion the Geffin site have the stronger exhibit.< /Text>< pictures>

The selection at the Geffen ranges from great to Ugh.  However, the graffiti
exhibit was alone worth the price of admission-which if you go on thursday
after 5 pm is FREE.  Like everything else, art museums depend on the
viewer-you know what you like and you may find it, you may not.
And on occasion you can be plessantly surprised.  Or not.
Beauty in this case is definitely in the eyes of the beholder: but worth
visiting to determine what you like.  Or don't.<//text>

Not as good as the Downtown branch, but then again maybe the exhibit that I went to just wasn't for me, and they change them frequently. Either way no complaints after visiting the Downtown MOCA this one is free on the same day.</Review>

I went to MOCA this past Saturday for the Hello Kitty Convention it was extremely small venue for all the attendees.

I been a fan of Hello Kitty since my sister introduced me to her at a very young age with pencils, stationary, and pencil boxes you name it! Now, we are able to enjoy it with her girls at the Hello Kitty Con. I got us all tickets to attend the Hello Kitty Con and it was a great experience to share this with them and my other girlfriends and their daughters as well.

Let's get to the juicy details of the HK Con.

- I heard about the insane lines after lines through two elite yelpers and realized with kids going with us it's not a good idea to go early so we got there at 11am.
- We parked at a $6 parking structure off of Commerical & Alameda Ave. It was a far walk to MOCA but it wasn't too bad.
- To our surprise, there's still a long line to get in but it wasn't too bad.
- As we waited in line, the workers/staff were handing out pins, stickers, HK rings, and smiles =) everywhere.
- Although, the lines were super long, everyone was tolerable of the wait and was showing a lot of excitement.
- There were vendors/licensees that sold HK products in the Supermarket area.  I got a souvenir HK sweater and custom made shirt. Everything was pricey of course so you had to pick and choose what you wanted.
- I didn't bother with the shop upstairs since it was 3-4 hour wait and it reminded me of the shop at Puroland in Japan so why bother.
- Their were a lot of photo op everywhere and it was so fun to take so many pictures of the arts, decor, vintage HK stuff, and awesome back drops in every room!
- We were extremely disappointed in TARGET collaboration with HK in the Carnival Room. We waited about 2 hours to get in line and we were almost at front when they announced they were no longer letting people inside. The security guards didn't even communicated that the line was cut short and that they were no longer accepting people inside. The people inside took their time playing the games. I feel bad for our kids and other kids waiting to play games.
- Outside, they had a fake tattoo area, nail shop, caricature area, pumpkin patch, penny machine, arts & crafts, and a huge line for the shop.
- There ware food trucks outside with long lines. I think they should've had more food options. So, luckily we ate before going and were okay all day.
- My favorite was seeing Hello Kitty two times and Yuko Yamaguchi.  I missed out on all the freebies like free drawn picture, signing, and classes that were sold out.
- We stayed until 7pm even though they were closing until 9pm for HK Birthday. We missed our free opportunity to go to the Japanese Museum.

Overall, it was a enjoyable experience but I would complain about the venue being small, long lines, and the collaboration with Target being unorganized.

I'm glad my friends and I had a great time regardless. I know Sunday is madness. Good luck to the attendees on Sunday.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) You can enjoy modern art. You can visit 2 places with a simple little space, friendly service and 1 ticket. It is 22 minutes walking distance from the apartment exhibition.

(Original)
현대미술을 즐길 수 있다. 간단하게 둘러보기 좋은 작은 공간, 친절한 서비스, 1 티켓으로 2곳을 둘러볼 수 있다. 22분 도보거리의 아파트먼트 전시였던 것 같은데 여유가 있다면 방문을 추천한다.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I visited the Adrián Villar Rojas installation and I found it impressive. I can not count more to not spoil the surprise, but it is highly recommended. It may not be suitable for young children or apprehensive people. It is accessed through a tinted door, next to the gift shop. Tickets are obtained at the box office, which is inside the souvenir shop. With the same ticket you can also access the MOCA in Grand, in front of The Broad.

(Original)
Visité la instalación de Adrián Villar Rojas y me pareció impresionante. No puedo contar más para no estropear la sorpresa, pero es muy recomendable. Quizás no sea apta para niños pequeños ni personas aprehensivas. Se accede por una puerta tintada, a continuación de la tienda de regalos. Los tickets se consiguen en la taquilla, que está dentro de la tienda de recuerdos. Con el mismo ticket también se puede acceder a el MOCA en Grand, en frente de The Broad.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Authentic warehouse type museum. It is recommended to go this place before grand ave moca because it is the installation work center.

(Translated by Google) Small museum but very nice. Really everything that was exhibited here was beautiful and grandiose. Unfortunately, on the day when I was there, half of the museum was being rebuilt, so there was very little of the small museum left for me to see, but I'll be back :) In addition, you could visit another museum with the ticket from this museum, which was only a 5 minute walk away and included an exhibition. I thought all of it was cool.

(Original)
Kleines Museum aber sehr fein. Wirklich alles, was hier ausgestellt wurde war wunderschön und grandios. Leider war an dem Tag als ich da war die Hälfte des Museum am Umbauen, also blieb von dem kleinen Museum nur ganz wenig für mich zu sehen aber ich komme wieder :) Außerdem konnte man mit dem Eintrittskarte von diesem Museum noch einen anderen Museum besuchen, die nur 5 min Gehweg entfernt war und eine Ausstellung beinhaltete. Ich fand alles davon geil.< /Text>
