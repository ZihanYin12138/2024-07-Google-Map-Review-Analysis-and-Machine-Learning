California pest control is the best company out there. My technician, David, does an excellent job and I literally haven’t seen a bug on my property in months! I highly recommend You give them a call. James and Mark are the best termite inspectors in the business and helped make purchasing a home easy and safe!</review>

Needed a pest inspection prior to the sale of a home. Heard amazing things about California Pest Control. James came and did a very thorough inspection. On time, professional, courteous. David was then sent in to treat areas that were affected by termites. The customer service with CPC is out of this world. They know their stuff! The whole team is well educated, yet humble and helpful. They know their competition and what tactics other companies are employing that lead to failure to control the bugs and ultimately getting more money from their customers. David went above and beyond anything expected from our service with them. My family was grieving the loss of a loved one (hence the sale of the home) and the interaction with David and the team over those few days touched our hearts. They are more than a pest control company. I wish they did more services so we had excuses to hire them again. If you are looking for a group of professionals that not only have the education and skills, but are helpful and kind on EVERY a level, please give them a try. Stellar company, which is hard to find these days!!</review>

<review>Kyle and John were very professional and helpful with the needs of my pest control.  They both listened and took the time to give me suggestions to help prevent critters coming into my home ie…door sweeper for the garage door. I am very happy with their service and look forward to doing business with them.< /review>< username>

We've tried other companies and had continuous problems. We finally decided to call California Pest Control & hopped on a bi-monthly plan and we have not seen anything in months! They are also extremely professional. Dave will call to give updates and check in on problems in and around the house. I also love that they have a feature to pay online. We are going to continue service with them, I love the preventive measures and peace of mind that California Pest Control has given our family.<//Text>

Ryan B came out to inspect our home.  I informed him that mice have invaded our home.  He said that he found mice and RAT droppings were present.... rat?? oh gross...  not what an earlier rep notified us about.  Ryan also offered to repair the outside vents to prevent the rodents from entering our home-- my husband was sold at the mention of someone else providing that service!  Happy campers here!  Thank you Ryan!< /text>

I came from a apartment complex that used CALIFORNIA PEST CONTROL. I've had different pest control companies in the past that have not been nearly as effective as this company. As most people it's embarrassing to have to admit that you have a pest problem. The I was assigned John Stevens while I was at my apartment complex. I was terrified I had bed bugs. he was very professional and understanding, he went room by room with me. I recently moved in to a house and wanted to protect myself from the previous infestation. I acquired services through California pest control. I knew right away what company to go to. I called and asked for John. he came out and immediately began a walk through with me, we came up with a plan that wold best fit my needs. we chose the every other month which is the best way to go. your covered for anything and every with just one low monthly cost. John is a very kind and gentle guy, he's very courteous and honest. he will answer all of your questions and even identify bug for you. just to have someone come into your home after being on edge because you have pest, while being treated with respect like your a old friend that John, it doesn't get any better than that. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND JOHN STEVENS, this company is great. if more people went with California pest control we could all eliminate the pest together. thank you very much John.< /Text>

<Text>I had a few different companies come out for a termite problem and I was not confident in any of them so I called a friend and asked if she had a referral. That’s how I came into contact with James. He was informative, professional, and personable. I appreciated his honesty in not trying to sell me on services for pests we knew I didn’t have. The other companies all had done so, without exception. And James was the only one of them who followed up with me.
The office staff was unlike the other companies as well. They were courteous and professional. The other companies’ staff left me asking, “Why am I even dealing with these people?” It’s sad that decent customer service should be a bonus and not a standard, but I definitely got it here.
And on my treatment day Dave was just a genuinely nice man to deal with. Even my grumpy old dog appreciated his manners. I couldn’t be happier with my decision to use California Pest Control.<//Text>< Pics>

Dave was very thorough and professional. Even came half an hour before the start time. My husband and I are delighted and highly satisfied of the services offered and want to give Dave a personal thank you and recommendation. We live in an apartment complex and was greeted with nothing but professionalism and courtesy. Dave sprayed inside the apartment and outside our apartment unit. Dave was very knowledgeable and handled everything with care. I cannot recommend enough: California Pest Control is the way to go. If you're unsure, give them a call and get it done right the first time! Thank you Dave!!</Text>

He explained he was unable to find an entry and that it was possible there maybe a pipe leak between the walls and it seems he was right.  Plumber will fix leaking pipe.  Thanks Ryan.  I am sure I will be calling you for Maintenance Service soon.</text>< Pics>

<text>I had my first service with California Pest Control today so I cannot speak on the pest control care quite yet (though I have no doubts), but John was my tech and he was such a nice guy. He is extremely friendly with a very kind and gentle demeanor. It felt like I made a friend today and he shared that he was going to be my normal tech. They assign one to each customer which is nice to always know who will be coming to your home. I appreciated how comfortable John made me feel with being in my home and I look forward to my continued service with California Pest Control.<//text><user_id>110935415861674957902< /user_id>< Response>

These guys are like family. I love Steve and have been with this company for about 9 years now.
They are super knowledgeable, helpful, and
kind. They have the best customer service anywhere.  Having a rental with a lot of issues, they’ve always gone out of their Way to do a thorough and complete job, making sure the property Was well taken care of despite having difficult tenants to work
Around.They’ve also serviced my personal home
and take care of issues quickly and with great professionalism. I will never use another company and never recommend anyone else to my
Family and friends.You will always be with good hands with these guys and I can’t thank them
Enough for the great job they always do!<//text>

<Text>Had a bad rat problem due to a field behind my house.   Called them out within a week 5 dead.  I haven't heard or seen one since.  I called my guy when they were caught and he came right out and got them and reset the traps.   Sprayed the house and yard.  ❤👏😘</Text>< Pics>

<review>I have been working with California Pest Control for many years! They do amazing work and ALWAYS stand by their word, even though there's a work order signed by all parties, they do what it takes to keep things moving forward.The best thing I love about CPC is they will look at other repair costs from other companies & compete with their bid so the sellers/buyers can afford the work to be done and we can close in a timely manner! I have to say I have never been disappointed with the work performed and how professional the all are!!

Thank you for your service!!<//review><UserId.>102953379577752591730<//UserId.><date>1552522661254<//date>< rate>

This was by far the best pest control service I've ever gotten. The treatments are very theral and are basically where you ask your treatment to be in your home. It's a little more money but differently worth it to be pest free finally!! Great company to choose👍👍< /Text>

I chose CA Pest Control because of great reviews on Yelp. I contacted them for a family member who had a severe roach and rodent issue. I have received the service expected. My calls and questions are answered in a timely manner. Appointments have been made to accommodate my schedule. And reminders about appointments are valuable. Thank you Steve for being kind and courtesy at each service call.<//Review>

<Review>Great company! Honest, helpful, reliable and personable. My pest control guy, Steve, gives me a call/text the day before he is going to come to remind me to keep my backyard gate unlocked so he has access to spray. He also asks if there are any pest problems that may need some extra attention. Steve is always friendly and professional. I believe in supporting small local business.</Review><time>1538951108619< /time>< user>

I will recommend all the home sellers and real estate agents to do termite pre-inspection, so you know if there is any problem and fix it with your own contractor prior put the house on market.  As most of the lenders will ask for section one clearance certificate prior funding, you don 't want to wait until last min. I have done several termite inspections through James, his very knowledge and professional and know what's his doing and give good advice how to take care the problems found.< /Review>

We had ants in our home for years. Sometimes we would wake up to trails with thousands of ants. There was no way we could leave any food on the counter, or in the pantry unless in was sealed shut. I finally called California Pest Control. They are very good at what they do. Immediately our ant problem was over. It has been over a year since I've seen even one ant in our home. Let them rid you of your pest problem for good.< /Review>

<Review>I hired California Pest Control for my own home and Steve did an awesome job! I had a bad problem with roaches. Reliable, retuned calls and responded to all concerns promptly.
I had previously used another company and was so disappointed. It seemed as though the roaches multiplied after their visit.
The very first time Steve from California Pest Control treated, the problem was taken care of the first time.
Haven’t had any roaches since!
I will never use any one else! I have also used them for my rentals because there was a bedbug problem there, it was scheduled and they an awesome job removing every trace of bedbugs!

<review>They were excellent! Greg, the owner, came out and assessed the problem and John came out twice, two weeks apart and got rid of the problem. They were both very professional. John was thorough and did an amazing job! We've lived in the same home for 15 years and never had any pest control issues. It's been almost 7 months since they came out and we've not seen one "uninvited" guest. Pest control is one of those services you never want to use, but if we ever needed to again, we would call California Pest Control without a doubt. I highly recommend them!</review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>their service works. before i moved into my house i had these big nasty roaches in my garage. some smaller ones was in my house. plus i had spiders. after using CPC for couple of months, i say after the 2nd and 3rd time, the presence of bugs diminished! great job. only downside, is price, and sometimes they are difficult to get a hold off via email, but they do respond when you call. i like how they allow online payments too via paypal, very convenient for me.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80900cbeea5b500b:0x12a3ca19bbc15052<//gmap_id><Time>1550096280374<//Time></record></dataset><record>

If you want to have some good breakfast then Chicken as Cluck is the place to visit. We had ordered burrito and it was absolutely delicious highly recommend it. Fast delivery as well. Will definitely order again and highly recommend!!

Don’t bother, made me wait 40 minutes for a chicken sandwich. Barely acknowledges people for pickup, especially if you aren’t working for a delivery app.<//text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>I love hot chicken! This place doesn't disappoint. It's every bit as good as Dave's   They also have pizza which I haven't tried yet, but admire the creativity. What separates them a little from the rest is the sauce. It's similar to what you find at other Nashville hot chicken places but has more seasoning. Very nice people too.<//Review>< Pics>

It was realllly good! Those double dredged fries were so amazing and I got the chicken bites. I have one complaint though! I ordered the Nashville hot burrito for my boyfriend. It said there was chicken, fries, cheese & special sauce. Except there was full chunks of potato which made up most of the burrito instead of the fries. Also onions & bell peppers? So that was very misleading. Wish it was what the menu stated.< /text>

I waited outside for an hour for them to complete my order of ONE chicken sandwich.  Stood outside the entire wait and they continued to just say “it’s coming” or just blatantly ignored me.  Don’t even bother with this place.  This is hands down the worst service I have ever had!<//text>

Everything on the menu has been thought through and is so much more than your average chicken sandwich or mozzarella sticks - my favorites were the Kentucky fried cauliflower (so delicious!!), and the hot Cheetoh mozzarella sticks!! But you really can’t go wrong with anything on the menu. Will be returning.< /text>< pictures>

The food here is ridiculously delicious. We ordered a Nashville hot chicken sandwich, the 9-spice chicken sandwich, and an order of their fries - all of it was amazing. The 9-spice was the family favorite and even just writing about it is making me drool. It had a kick but also depth in flavor.. can't wait to go back!< /Review>

<Review>Decided to finally try this place since they recently opened up in here. Delicious hot juicy chicken.The fries were nice and crispy . The French roll was was nice and soft . Only wish that my tender was big as the French roll it came in. I will be back to try their wings and tenders on its own. Overall very good chicken for the price.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1598249645984, 'text': 'Thanks for coming Curtis!

The fries were crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The wings were crunchy and spicy so that was perfect. The Nashville chicken sandwich was delicious just the right amount of crunch. The spice was very on point!!! The cheese and pickles enchanted the flavor.

Pros: spice level was on point, crunch was amazing, love the side options
Cons: wish they had a storefront :(</review>

<review>Somebody help me I'm addicted to this place! Being from Singapore, few would get my craving for Mcspicy burger(cannot be found anywhere else than in a Singapore Macdonalds). This is it though, the closest I'll get to my dreams! The Nashville burger and the Evil Ex are super, though still not as spicy as I'd hope. Fries and chicken nuggets are dope too. Everything is fried to perfect crispiness and I'm a huge fan of their tangy sauce. Just LOVE.<//review>< gmapID>

I got the Chicken as Cluck wings with 9 pepper. Clucking delicious. Listed 9 pepper as "medium" spicy but seemed much spicier than mid-level. Can't imagine how spicy the Nashville could be.< /Text>

<review>I got home to bite into my sandwich and the chicken meat was still red. It was gamy and tough to chew. I had to throw it in the toaster oven. the fries also tasted old. On top of that the bill was over $50 for 3 items. Terrible experience.</review>< Pictures>

This kitchen is amazing! Quickly becoming my go-to in this time of self-quarantine. Every time I get something here I am impressed, there is just something special about they way they fry that chicken! 10/10 would recommend to a friend.<//Text>

<Review>I have to admit, I always thought I was one who couldn't handle spice...even the chili dust from eating popcorn chicken would set my mouth ablaze. With that being said, I never really enjoyed hot chicken sandwiches to it's full potential; I always opted for 'non-spicy'. My life changed 180 when I decided to give Chicken as Cluck's Nashville hot chicken sandwich a try...with ACTUAL spice! Oh My Goodness, the sandwich was sooo good! Although it was mild-medium spicy, it was a just the right amount spice that just meets my threshold. The chicken meat was very moist and the brioche bun was the perfect carrier. I gobbled it up and enjoyed every bite. To accompany the sandwich, I ordered sweet potato fries, which have a panko batter coating. This is great as the fries are extra crispy. Who doesn't love a good crunch?!

I'm glad that Chicken as Cluck was my gateway sandwich to the Nashville hot chicken sandwich world.</Review>< pics>

Okay it's pretty costly compared to Popeye's or McDonald's. I would say it's quality vs. quantity in this comparison. I really enjoyed the sauces and the chicken sandwich. The avocado fries was the star of the show. The avocado fries were tender and delicious. The different sauces make the difference.<//Review>

I'm so glad they're still available for delivery!  I don't think you can find better tasting chicken in Portrero Hill than here.  My go-to meal is always the Mother Clucker and a side of their delicious potato crisps.  Be careful with your wallet though because when you see their menu, you'll want to get everything they offer!< /Review>

I have never encountered awesome and over the top customer service from any restaurant like I have from Chicken as Cluck - they overlooked some of our items and I called to advise them of the situation and they took care of me with No problem and No hesitation - I will definitely be coming back to Chicken as Cluck and I commend everyone from the owner to her staff for going that extra mile to make a customer happy and pleased - keep up the good work and see you really soon again!!!!<//Review>

This is a cloud kitchen restaurant, which you can order through various of food delivery apps: uber eats, grub hub and doordash.

The food here is amazing, we had our nashville burger and its pretty spicy and hot but we love it. We also order unique avocado fries and battered sweet fries.

The best part of this restaurant is that they use top quality ingredients such as organic chicken. Unlike other restaurant, their fried chicken is also extremely juicy.

For the sauce, the chipotle af and secret sauce af taste really good and spicy. They also have ranch sauce but taste super good compare to the other one.<//text>

<Review>The Nashville hot was the most delicious sandwich I’ve ever had.  Every bite had the perfect amount of crunch, the sauce and seasoning were dynomite, and the bun was as fresh and delicious as ever.  My mouth is drooling again just by thinking about it.  And do yourself a favor and GET THE AVOCADO FRIES!!</Review>< pics>

<review>I absolutely love Flame Broiler. Was so excited to have my first meal out of the house after quarantine, and in my excitement I forgot to say no sauce please on the tofu because I am allergic. It was less than a few minutes and I quickly corrected myself interrupting the cashier who was taking her next order. She announced to the cook the problem and she said "I'm so sorry its too late they already started it." There was a line of people, and a lot of awkward silence. I said there's nothing you can do? She said sorry. I  then asked her to donate my meal so it wouldn't go to waste and walked out. This review is just to say my heart hurts on how this world is today. And I hope the $14 you made off of me was worth me not being a repeat customer at your store ever again.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c332b5caa5caa1:0x15b196ce5f1c2ecc<//Gmap_id><userid>117478522818304555124< /userid><username>Cori Mitchell<//username><Rating>1<//Rating>< Time>

<Text>I like this place because I can call in my order and it's ready when I get there. I normally substitute veggies for the rice, and it's a healthy meal. The main thing I'd like to see changed is it takes too many tiny cups to get enough hot sauce to take home. They need bigger sauce cups.</Text>< username>

<Review>A great place to get some barbeque dishes. Even the bowls are great. Sometimes we will grab our meals to go and take it with us on a flight. Flame Broiler dishes are always fresh and hot. All the dishes are pretty good. Go there and try the bowls. Simple quick fresh not a big gouge on the wallet. The place to go for a quick bite< /Review>< Name>

Just your average flame broiler really, but any flame broiler deserves 4 stars. Chicken, vegetables, brown rice, and magic sauce. Always good and I feel like I'm eating semi healthy even though it's fast food.<//review>

<Review>I’ve have been coming to this location for a year now ordering the same bowl. A chicken bowl with veggies on the side. I come in tonight and the girls tells me with attitude, “If I want my veggies on the side there is a 50 cent extra charge” well the item is a Dart 3sU20 container that cost less that .08 cents and I am being charged .50 cents because I like my food separate. I don’t agree.<//Review>< Pics>

I've been coming here for years & I wouldn't go anywhere else to get my hair cut. If anyone has anything negative to say go find another shop. There are nothing but solid hard working smart educated men working here. If you don't like the walk-in wait make an appointment. Simple. Juice & SD are nicest with the clippers.</Text>

WARNING!!!!!!!! Don't go here. The customer service sucks. A bunch of thugs cutting hair. Not only that the wait for a walk in is ridiculous & the attitudes are very poor. NO STAR  but they made me choose 1< /review>

I came in to smog my wife’s old car that had been sitting awhile in our driveway. Our son would be driving it soon so I went to Beaumont Smog one Saturday and was really nervous about it passing but the gentleman working was beyond helpful. Our car passed and I learned a lot, short story I was stressing for no reason. Thank you<//text>

Simple, and quick. 15 min in and out. Staff was  courteous, and friendly. Staff was using appropriate protection for current pandemic situation, hand sanitizer, face masks. I'd recommend this place.< /text>

< Review>
Called to see if they were a certified smog business and when they closed. They said they have been closing early because of covid but they stayed open long enough for me to get there and helped a great deal! Thank you and I highly recommend this business to anyone looking to get a smog check done!!<//Review>

<text>Alex will fail you for no reason and if the there are multiple things wrong with the car he'll tell you them one by one so you have to keep coming back and pay every time. I got a used car that failed legitimately. I fixed the problem, brought it back and it failed again for a different reason. I fixed that problem, brought it back and it failed again for another different reason. Now why wouldn't he just tell me everything that was wrong the first time when it was all clearly visible instead of making me pay him 3X more?

I took it to a mechanic and they confirmed the car should not have failed and last time and the part he pointed out clearly was not broken. I took it to a smog station 5 miles away and it passed. Alex and Beaumont Star Smog are not legit.

I just want to add in also Rolon Smog Check 5 miles away DOES NOT CHARGE for retesting if you fail. Beaumont Star Smog WILL CHARGE YOU REPEATEDLY.  Rolon is also a bit cheaper.

You have so many more options for smog testing there's no reason to take the chance here. Do not support this illegitimate business.<//text><rate>1</rate><resp>{'time': 1562603398265, 'text': "Before we start any service on any vehicle the customer's authorized to sign   The invoice that specifies smog  Inspection fee is due whether your vehicle passes or fails the test.

<review>Just moved back into town with out-of-state vehicles and needed smog checks on both.... we didn't know where to go so I checked out Google reviews and chose Beaumont Star. VERY happy with both visits for our cars!
Alex was extremely professional, thorough, and quick.
If you're in need of a smog check, I highly recommend Beaumont Star. Very happy customer here!<//review>< pics>

Went here for a tire and to get it installed, and I got to say I was really impressed with the guys working here, they were nice and very fast on doing their work! As cars came they went because they were just on top of everything and just doing their job the right way! We were vary happy with the service and would definitely go back and recommend this place to anyone!</Text>

<Text>Alex and his wife run a very good shop. I brought my RV in for its bi-annual check and I forgot to check the Saturday hours. I showed up at 9am, but the shop's posted hours said the shop opened up at 10. Alex and his wife showed up a little after 9, got the shop up and running, and took me in right away. No BS, no muss, no fuss. I was out of there in 20 minutes. Alex was very professional and friendly. That means a lot to me and I will be bringing my other vehicles here in the future. I will tell all of my friends about him as well. The only complaint I have is not Alex's fault. Be prepared to deal with a tight maze as there are many auto repair shops here and the parking is very tight. Overall, great job, Alex!<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Alex was nice at “face level” but definitely snooped around my car to give me explanations that were not relevant to the smog test. Do yourself a favor and find one of the many more smog locations around Beaumont and Banning area. You will be thankful you didn’t waste your time here.</Text>

I believe Alex is very trust worthy and I have taken several vehicles for smog to this establishment. I understand that running a Smog shop in California is a very tricky business, you want to help customers with knowledge, however you can get dinged and fined by the state if there is an appearance that you are helping get car pass a smog check "illegally." I believe Alex is very knowledgeable and honest and does what he can to help people.< /Text>

Was taken advantage of!!! Alex is not a trustworthy business owner. I took my vehicle to Alex years ago to get a smog and had a wonderful experience. So when it can time to smog my other car he was the first place I had in mind. Alex did my smog test and it failed, I had forgotten that my check engine light was on, so before I left I asked could that have been the reason why my car failed the smog, he answered “that could be”...I paid Alex, left his shop and started call other local smog check locations, they all let me know that if my check engine light is on the car would not pass the smog. I call Alex 10min later and he said that he didn’t have to disclose that to me, and he didn’t break any laws, as he was yelling at me. I asked Alex if he could do my retest for free after I fix my check engine light, he agreed after we went back and forth about the whole situation looking crooked... I got my check engine light fixed and called him back, he let me know that it’s equipment is not working... been trying to make it appointment ever since and he is longer answering my phone calls.< /text>

< Review>
Charges almost full price for failed smog even when he knew that the computer wasn't ready, when it could have been easily avoided. He couldnt even determine why my smog didnt pass. I had to go to another smog place to ask why it failed. Do not go here, there are way better smog places that actually know what is wrong with the car. He seemed high also. Best place for Smog in Banning is (California Smog Check Station). The guy that works there has great skills and is knowledgable. Doesnt cheat you like Beaumont Star.< /Review>

At your own risk. Seriously I just went through a situation here that was criminal but It was my word against his. This owner cut a wire and falsely put that vacuums lines to EGR valve were unplugged. I reported him to the bureau of automotive. They opened a case against him. The inspector came to visit my RV and was not happy with what he saw. Mind you these are top rated mechanics hired by the state to check allegations filed by customers. He told me it was obvious that wire was cut but no vacuum lines were undone at EGR. He further said that the smog guy didn't even document the cut wire. When smog guy was questioned about that. His response was he forgot to document the wire cut. Amy case the inspector reassured me that guys like this either shape up or get so many county violations that the will lose there licence to operate. Bad bad shop.

Update. This will be my last post on this shop. I know the newest post go on top and so my post will eventually be in the archives. To be fair the owner did give me a full refund when recommended by the bureau of automotive and repair after the investigation was over. After all I was put through I only wish him and his family the best (we are all worthy of second chances).< /Text>

<Review>Service was okay except I never received phone notification when my car was ready.  The mechanic suggested that I go for coffee and they'd call when car was ready. I went for coffee and waited in nearby restaurant.  Waited, waited, waited.... Finally I went over there and my car had been sitting there ready for I don't know how long.<//Review><Time>1523894603168<//Time><pictures>None</pictures><rating>2< /rating>< userid>

We are held accountable to the state laws and the customer is held accountable for their vehicles being compliant with state laws.   We often have to be direct when reviewing the smog test with the customers, which is different then being rude.  We always strive for good customer service.'}</Response>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Have been going to Alex for years, very friendly, professional, and tells you the truth if there's an issue with your vehicle, I have a wide variety of cars from corvette to an older motor home, and he knows what he's doing on every one ! My suburban failed once and he is a test only station, but he told me what to look for and he was right, I replaced the defective part and it passed without any issues, I will continue to use his services as long as I have cars that need smog checks.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Ok, so the reviews for this company are truly real.  We bought my husband's beloved truck here. We were there about 2 1/2 hours, which is quick for buying a car.  While we waited for the paperwork to be drawn up, they went out and bought us and another family pizza.  Who does that?!  They will work hard to get even the hardest person financing.  They are all very knowledgeable and personable. Best experience I have ever had at a car dealership. I felt valued.< /text>< resp>

I don’t really post reviews online, but I felt I had too for these guys. I haven’t bought from a dealership in years, and I was really hesitant and nervous about it, but Ernie and Ronny truly helped me out. They got me in a car of my dreams for a price I can afford. They made it happen, getting me a good payment plan and even helped with affordable insurance and I am very thankful for their work. 10 out of 10 would recommend.</Text>

Quality Auto Finder are fantastic to deal with. Daniel went above and beyond to find us the kind of family car (Now a family of 4) that we were looking for. We are very pleased with our purchase. They are the only ones to deal with when buying a vehicle. Will definitely go back.<//review>

Daniel at Quality Auto Finder is my go-to guy for anything car related. Need something fixed? Daniel. Need to buy or sell? Daniel. Need to find a good car detailed person without spending my kid's college fund to pay for them? Daniel.

Highly recommend him and his company. They treat you like family.<//review>

We all know shopping for a car can be a hassle. Daniel was the first person who greeted me and helped me out with my questions. He made the experience less stressful and was very helpful when helping me choose the best car for my budget. I don't often bother to review my experiences, but I felt like the quality of his service merits the review. I highly recommend this place to help you get mobilized again. Thanks, Daniel. Your positive energy and great attitude is sure to keep customers coming back to you.< /review>

<Review>My Daughter and I were doing some car shopping and stopped by Quality Auto Finder to check out what they had. We were greeted by Ernie who then introduced us to Ron. Ron was very attentive and listened to what we were looking for in my Daughter's price range and selection of cars. She found a great car within her parameters. We did some price crunching, along with Quality jumping through a few hoops for her, and we left with the car of her dreams. Absolutely a great experience for my Daughter's first time buying a car. I would and will recommend this Dealership to my friends and familia. Thank you to all the staff at Quality</Review>< Pictures>

Since having my first baby I was ready to upgrade my car for something I felt safer in. I did a lot of shopping around and finally ended up at quality auto finder. I was helped by Daniel, he was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about all the vehicles. He took me on a test drive and I am happy to say I landed my dream car for my new little family! I had an amazing experience and would 100% recommend visiting Quality auto finder and asking for Daniel to help you find exactly what you're looking for.< /text>

Daniel C. is the man to go to if you're looking for a good deal on a GOOD car! I've spent tons of time looking at different dealerships for cars and I have never had a more comfortable experience as I had with Daniel. No gimmicks, no bs and definitely quality service. Must see him before deciding to make a decision with a car elsewhere!<//Review>

I bought a Jeep for well under what it was worth with great service and negotiating, then returned with a issue that I had caused myself. After explaining my issue the owner took it upon himself to do everything he could to fix it within the very next business day and split the repair price with me. This place with this new owner deserves nothing but 5 stars.<//text>

<Date>1540470965020< /Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>Update: 10/19/18 Got a call from Daniel, the person I was supposed to originally meet on 10/17/18 with some good news. This car was financed at 20+ % and payments were something I was accepting of even though it was much higher than I anticipated. After a lot of haggling and backroom dealing they were able to drop my rate to 13% and my monthly payment by $128.  So with that I can't help but to give credit where credit is due.  So I'm revising my review to 4.5 stars (I round up).  The -1/2 star is for the hassle.

Great follow-up to a contentious purchase. Now that's customer service!
---------------------------------
10/17/18  Was greeted by Edwin and it was supposed to be Daniel who failed to inform me that he wasn't going to be around...strike 1 (- 1 star). I go in and explain what it is I wanted to do with the financing of the car that I picked and was assured that my bank would refinance it at a much lower rate. I even wanted to purchase the 48 hour return policy but was talked out if it...strike 2 (- 1 star). I find out from my financial advisor the following day that they can't refi the car that I picked which turned my excitement into anger because I felt like I got duped...strike 3 (-1 star). You'd think they'd out but no.

Now my role in all this played a big part because I went against my instinct. I'm usually more savvy than this but my financial advisor had recommended them and it turns out that Daniel, the person I was supposed to meet, knew of the bank's policies and could've helped me pick something that would've fallen within the parameters I had set. So in the end I only can be mad at myself.  The vehicle itself is pretty sweet, a BMW x3, and it wasn't horribly expensive until you add the interest.  They did their job and I failed to do mine...foul ball (+ 1 star)</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

7 months ago my daughter bought a very nice car and before she drove it off the lot, the OWNER showed her everything, even the engine and everything she needed to know about the car.  I can't say enough good things about Quality Auto Finder and Jesus is an awesome caring person!  We were lucky to find Quality Auto Finder!< /text>

<review>I bought a car less than 3 months ago and my car broke down the hybrid system light went on as well as the VSC light.  I went in yesterday and they said they will send me a text message on where to go get it fix as the cars they sell don't have warranty.... I was told I could still drive my car WRONG! I was on my way to work The check engine lights goes on my car starts shaking as I'm on the freeway I break down!!!! Only had this car for nearly 3 months. Hopefully I can get a hold of somebody today.</review>< Pics>

I would not recommend this place!! I bought a Mercedes from here and a couple weeks later it would not go in reverse and they act like they didn't care at all when I contacted them and ask if they would be able to help me get it fix. The car was clean but it had a lot of mechanical issues. I had a mechanic look at it and he told me that a lot of things were wrong with the car they just ghetto rigged it to make it appear like nothing was wrong with the car. So after about a year me and my wife was desperate for a car and I found out that this place was under new management so I was hoping for a better experience because we were on a budget and not a lot of dealerships take only $800 down payment. So we got another car from this place and we had issues with this car as well. Now this car won't even start. So i would never go back to this dealership again!!< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>This place is garbage!!! My sister bought her first car there. The battery in the car wasn’t the right size for the car. The rear view mirror was upside down! Windshield wipers were old (to where they didn’t even wipe). The check engine light came up 2 days after she took the car home. They “replaced the battery” yet it still wasn’t the right size. It kept wobbling. The tire pressure light kept coming up and when we tried letting them know they wouldn’t answer our calls or return our messages. Her tire blew up this morning and went to discount tire to replace it. They told her all her tired were older than 10 years and the sensors were broken not even hooked to the tires. I don’t recommend anyone buy anything from this place unless you really know how to check for all the details. I wouldn’t call the guys friends either...< /review>< Pictures>

At first, everything was going great. My wife and i took possession of the vehicle at 8:47pm. The owners left when we left. Next day i called because the keyless entry remote wasn't working. They replaced the battery,  put it back together with crazy glue, and still didint work.  They took it apart again and put more glue on it and after 2 hours of trying to make it work, they told me  i needed  a new remote. Because the cars are sold as is, i was to pay for the control.  I told them that i felt that i shouldn't have to pay for something that comes standard with all cars and that the remote they tried to fix was now all covered with crazy glue.  Still they said that the cost was going to be mine. I got out of there pissed.  I dont think thats fare.  On top of the cost of the car, im stuck paing $300 for the new keyless entry remote.

Please be very careful and look at every single detail when buying from this dealer...</text>

Its was our first time looking into financing a car and we just happened to find this place. All their cars were very clean and well kept. The staff there were very friendly. From the moment we set foot on their lot all the way to their office, they helped us a lot on finiding a fitting car for us and wokred on a payment option that suited us. I would definetly look into them again in the future.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend it to buy my SUV there and apart from the fact that they left my pregnant wife waiting for almost an hour, they delivered her with less than a quarter of gasoline, the worst thing the car blew smoke after 3 weeks I returned it to me they repaired it and at 2 weeks it stayed the same, a few days ago the engine broke down, and I'm still paying for it, bad treatment and attention.

No lo recomiendo compre mi SUV ahí y aparte de que dejaron a mi esposa embarazada esperando casi una hora, le entregaron con menos de un cuarto de gasolina, lo peor el carro lanzó humo a las 3 semanas lo regresé disque me lo repararon y a las 2 semanas quedo igual, hace unos días el motor se averió,  y aun lo ando pagando,  mal trato y atención.< /review>< Gmap_id>

The service here was horrible, there were two young women who are running the front counter. In which I asked questions about dairy free options and one of the girls had no idea about anything. In which I tried to order two separate items and one of the women were just completely clueless and could not give me what I ordered. Then I added candy to my order just for something sweet and she couldn’t do the math to give me my money back. Then on top of that I was not aware that they are cash only. There was no specification that it was cash only as well, in which I was told that out to only cash. I’m trying to have a nice vacation with my family, and this was not a good ending to my day.</review>

The place is cash only, unsanitary place. The ice cream is being touched without gloves on while handling cash 😐< /Text>

They offer the usual -- ice cream in 15 flavors, ice cream in a bowl, ice cream in a cone (waffle or otherwise).  But it's not like this is a must-go location.  If you're in the area and fancy a treat of ice cream, feel free to drop in; there aren't any other noticeable ice cream shops in the immediate area.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I've been going here since before I can remember. Only now as an adult have I noticed that the man who is probably the owner is unceasingly kind and humourous and engaging, even to kids just learning to order and pay on their own, which is kind of a big deal. Every time. All day long. Since I was a kid, and now for my kid. And let's not forget the waffle cones are kind of amazing.< /Review>

The owner was so kind and made my 4 year old a special cone with cream and sprinkles for no cost.  My other children ordered and the little one was not sure if she wanted anything because she had just woke up from a nap.  Thank you for making my daughter feel special!   She loved the ice cream! Souza’s cone is absolutely a great family business that cares!< /review>

<review>I stopped here with 4 friends on 6-18-20.  I was caught off guard given the environment we are in that they are still cash only.  If this isn't enough to get you motivated to join the 21st century and care for the customer I don't know what will.  I was further surprised that there were 3 employees,  only one seemed to be doing anything and she was both dishing out ice cream and handling the cash without gloves while digging into the ice cream.  They've lost me as a loyal customer.   After reading other reviews it's now apparent that they don't care about reviews, but there are better options right there in the village.  They must survive on tourists alone that don't know any better.</review>< pictures>

Very disappointed to find a place in 2020 that not only refuses to take anything but cash, but also doesn't warn you until you are at the cash register. Poor experience in general with inadequate social distancing.< /Text>

Two stars instead of one due to location close to the beach, seating area outside), and the fact that the kids liked it. Otherwise this is an overpriced tourist trap. Supermarket ice cream, and they charge $1 for an extra cup.<//text>

Don't go to this place! They want to cheat you for your money.  The cashier took money from us and then later denied having received the payment. She asked us to pay again! They take only Cash and do not give a receipt. Shady place alert!!! I would give it no stars.</Review>

<user>107172901423736451638</user><text>Nailpro is always busy, but with good reason. Good location, clean and bright inside. Their Pedicure service is always great, and although I always stick with Aaron for my acrylics, (who is amazing and an extremely talented artist!)...but as far as I've seen, all of the other nail techs are also really good as well. Definitely recommend this place< /text>< name>

<date>1510885611311< /date><rate>5< /rate><Text>Today was my first time visiting Nail Pro and I’m beyond impressed . Everyone greats you as you walk in. The place is pretty clean and organized . It’s small but everything’s spaced out so you have room and you can move comfortably. I went to Henry . He made sure all my nails were filed evenly and thin ( a personal preference).  He was very gentle and made sure I liked everything he did as he did it . I will definitely be returning and recommending this nail shop.

The only CON to this place is their gel selection is smaller than what I’m used to but I wouldn’t even consider it a con because the service is so amazing .< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I got a mani pedi.  Quickest pedicure I've ever received.  The lady who did my manicure was rough and was hacking away at my cuticle and she made me bleed. It's cheap but also they're kinda sloppy. You've been forewarned.</Review>

OK gel manicure, OK price ($23). This was the price the receptionist told me for a gel color change. Waited over a half an hour for a walk in, mani was very rushed but came out OK. When I went to pay, they told me five more dollars for the color change ($28), but I politely refused to pay the extra because the extra charge was not mentioned upfront or noted on the price menu.<//Text>< user_id>

<review>I disliked this place very much I’m so angry at how rushed and unprofessional they are with everything. Literally my manipedi was ruined because they didn’t even bother setting my nails to dry before moving me. Horrible service. Disliked it very much.

< Review>
My mom and I went for the first time to this location. We usually go next door to JP's but they were busy and didn't acknowledge us when we stood at the front desk. At Nail Pro, my mom had Jim do her pedi and Henry do her mani. Both were very friendly and patient and did an excellent job. My mom asked for her a natural color and Henry found #187 which my mom really liked  happy with service. We will be returning:)< /Review>

<Text>I come here from time to time because of the convenient hours but they don't post their prices so you'll need to ask at the front desk. The quality really depends on who you get and that's the reason for the 4/5.< /Text></record>

<review>They dont honor your appointment time. If it wasn't for James and Hannah I would be going elsewhere. I hate to wait when I have an appointment. 5 min wait turns into 30 min. They have various people work on your nails to try to speed up the process.</review><user>116360417661235577709<//user><rating>3</rating>< Response>

Can do all nail art and has great selection of colors. Chrome, Rockstar, Gel. Got there at 9:45 am and left at 11:00 am. $38 for Rockstar on short nails. Its only been 4 days and the ends are chipping already....They were very attentive and friendly. Rockstar Gel doesnt stay long on My Nails so when I go back, Im trying the Chrome.< /Text>

<text>Had 3 children aged 11 and under with us. They pleasantly accommodated us with 2 separate tables outside and next to each other.
The adults and children ordered the same thing.
Orange chicken, Sesame chicken and California rolls.
Adults from the lunch menu, kids from the children's.
The portions were perfect. Staff was very friendly.

Restrooms were clean, stocked and in working order. Sushi display looked fresh and neat.

The food was delicious!
Would definitely eat here again.
The prices were reasonable too!

Solid sushi.    Their app was pretty to look at but a bit heavy inside.  Had to scrape some innards out.

Servers were friendly and the place looked great and is in a good location.

I am one and done here but it isn’t hateful.< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>Definitely worth every cent.

From walking in and being met with friendly staff to ordering and being attentive, everything was absolutely perfect.

Everything we ate had the perfect amount of flavor and al the food was hot!

Riceless sushi was so good!

Lettuce wraps with their sauce was incredible!

Absolutely the best restaurant my wife and I went to since visiting San Diego and we have been to Ferry Lansing, Little Italy, and Liberty Station!<//review><date>1555822354534</date><Gmap_id>0x80deaccc1a2f2ccb:0x3838db7647b13c23</Gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

Excellent little asia for restaurant. Chinese, Thai and sushi. It's real a great place and the wait staff are super nice. I only give a five for seller food/restaurant experience, so please don't mistake the 4 stars is anything other than really great.<//text>

The white rice was kind of cold, and so the soup and the tea. Last two time was better but this time,  I really didn't like it. Also,  we had to ask for forks, and soy sauce.<//Review>

<review>Nice little Asian fusion spot in Coronado. I came in towards the end of the evening and got a table by the window so I could people watch. My waiter, Jack, was fantastic and very attentive without being intrusive. I ordered the Mongolian beef and a side of garlic noodles. Jack suggested having the kitchen put them together instead of served separately, which was a good idea (since I was going to do that anyway). I also got a side of dumplings and a cocktail. My main course was excellent and the cocktail was made with a generous amount of booze ;) the dumplings were OK, but I've had better. Other than the dumplings it was a great meal. Although were I'm from this place would be considered a bit pricey, but for this area I would say the prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend this place!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDM7YGf69_gI4ZmVgSlLm2RDP55_7KJgquugFO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSPRFmE-OzQ7_p0SZtcY_M759kGwYoiRp-njJN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEcgcU1rp5CfBdBzuZbcWVuV6KA5yAcskfI8PT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><user>104477197896483046104< /user><gmap_id>0x80deaccc1a2f2ccb:0x3838db7647b13c23<//gmap_id><Name>Bill Chenoweth< /Name><Date>1536778587943<//Date>< response>

<review>We were walking along Coronado and wanted to check out a place for dinner. The menu looked good, so we just walked in. Waited about 5 mins before we got a table. I have to mention, as a side note, that our server, a pleasant older American gentleman, was extremely sweet!
I chose the warm sake. I've had better elsewhere, but I liked it. For food, we chose the Coronado Sushi and the pan fried rice noodles. The sushi was DELICIOUS. I'm not much of a sushi person unless they are spicy and do not have seaweed. This one hit all the right flavours! The wasabi was good. The crab in the sushi was very moist.  The pan fried noodles were pretty great too. Came with a bunch of veggies and beef. And although they were fried, they were soft and didn't make you feel bloated later. Amongst the two of us, we got these 2 plates and couldn't finish the noodles fully. The ambience is nice. If you love flavours and smell of spices, see if you can get a seat at the sushi counter or close to it. Good spot. Will be back.</review>< date>

Great place for families, dates or alone. Relaxing environment in an upscale setting a hard balance to achieve but this place aced it. Service was fast with helpful servers. Very clean! Food was great! The sesame seed sauce is a rave in my family.< /text>

First time here. The cocktails were ok, food was delicious. We sat at the bar, our bartender greeted us as we sat down. We ordered the Seaweed Salad, Pork Dumplings, the Big Boy, and the Volcano. The only disappointments were that our bartender wasn’t attentive..Our glasses were empty for awhile before he asked would we like another, and also our food took a long time to get to the table. The restaurant wasn’t packed, maybe they were just understaffed for that day? Not sure but nonetheless we will be back to give them another try.</review>

The food was great but I can tell our server wasn't happy being employed there and it reflected in the service. I hope she find what makes her happy in life.< /Text>

A few of us ordered takeout on 18th of October, for dinner and the food was horrible. Both the Teriyaki chicken and the Cashew chicken tasted the same and marinated in the same watery sauce. The Duck fried rice was subpar as the meat looked gray and unappetizing and the noodles in the lo mein were super chewy and not cooked all the way. When we moved to desserts, they were all frozen. We called to have this resolved but their server just instructed us to call back tomorrow, with a rude attitude as if they if they just didn't want to deal with it. Very disappointed as the first dine in experience we had was excellent.< /Text>

<username>Bhavik Patel<//username><review>The food here was okay. The ambience is very nice, and it's a prime location on Coronado Island. The appetizers, although good, we're quite oily. We ordered the veggie spring rolls and the crab and cheese wontons. The main meal was decent also, but I've had better Asian food at other places. Still, service was good and everyone was very polite.<//review></record>

Bistro D'Asia was fantastic. It was a late afternoon visit after 7 hours on the road. The chicken beef and vegetable fried rice. My wife is on a keto diet and they steamed some vegetables as a special request. Great service.<//text>

Wow. The sushi was phenomenal and from egg drop soup lover to another; the egg drop soup has corn and chicken chunks in it. Yum!! The cup size if the perfect start or perfect finish to your dinner. Will have to come back to try everything else.<//Review>

As an Asian person, I felt like the food was really sub-par. We ordered 3 different dishes, but they all seemed to use the same super sweet watery sauce... Kind of like the chef mixed up salt and sugar? I wasn’t really impressed by any of the food. I honestly felt like Panda Express does it better, for a better price too. (Everything is seriously expensive, for how sub-par it tastes.) I don’t really know how this place is “Asian fusion” either, other than that everything is super sweet. I didn’t see any Asian people dining here or working here, so maybe that should have been my first red flag. I would recommend against coming here.</text>

<review>I thoroughly enjoyed myself at Bistro d'Asia! The service was great, the food was very flavorful, and they had a wide array of options on the menu. Lots of options for vegetarians too! I ordered the veggie lo mein and the vegetable roll (both pictured below). I was seated at a table of 6 people and all of our food came out in great time!

If you're looking for asian food on Coronado Island, Bistro d'Asia is a winner!< /review>< gmapID>

Good variety of popular Asian dishes offered in an atmosphere of laid back sophistication. Courteous, attentive staff. Unfortunately, I didn't think the Pad Thai was all that good. (Maybe because it seemed to be prepared and seasoned differently than most places I've been.) However, that may be a one off considering the strength of the menu and recommendations by locals to try this place.<//text>

<text>My daughter and I stopped here for lunch while we were doing the SD Trolley Tour. We shared the chicken chow me in, which came with rice and a salad and we added a cup of egg drop soup and tropical iced tea to drink. The tea was the best part of the meal. The egg drop soup had pieces of chicken and corn which wasn't bad but I would have preferred they were left out. The salad was terrible because the dressing tasted like bitter peanut butter. The chow mein was just okay... nothing to get excited about and rice is rice so that was fine. However, the service was really good so I appreciated that. Our waitress kept our drinks filled and was very attentive. I don't know that I'd go back though.< /text>< rating>

It was ok. We had a chicken curry and a bowl of hot & sour soup. It was plenty of food for the 2 of us. But, we’ve had better tasting Asian food. I’d compare it to Panda Express Fast Food...but the prices are double or triple. So, for the price the quality isn’t there. However, it’s not terrible so if you’re visiting Coronado and you want Asian...it’s an okay place to go.<//Text>

<time>1548487535030< /time><rate>5</rate><Text>bistro to Asia is absolutely awesome. I love the ambiance there. I'm not much of a sushi eater but I've seen the sushi bar and it looks pretty incredible. My favorite items there are the Mongolian duck and the duck chow mein. But that's kind of a toss-up with the calamari salad. It's nothing like it sounds and you must experience it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The staff is polite and attentive and the food is amazing.< /Text>< Pictures>

Got sushi and ramen here, and it was superb. The ramen was a generous portion, and they didn't skimp on veggies and meat. The broth was divine. I wish I had it on tap. The sushi was incredibly fresh as well. Sarah, our server, was a delight. Would absolutely eat here again.<//text>

We ordered vegetarian chowmein with a side dish of snowpeas, mushroom and water chestnuts. The water chestnuts in the side dish were stale and tasted like they had gone bad. It could have caused sickness. The chowmein could have had more flavor and the service was very slow.<//Review>

<review>Expensive for low quality food. Took my family to this restaurant for dinner. We had a variety of dishes. Food was priced to take advantage of the tourists visiting Coronado. The taste was less than what you get from a cup-o-noodle.  Do your wallet and your tastebuds a favor by skipping this attempt at Asian food.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>The right ingredients but the wrong direction.

The quality of the food is great. I would say its slightly overpriced for what you get.

In terms of culinary direction, their menu needs some reworking.</text><UserId.>102874156448750594452</UserId.>< Resp>

I ordered one of their specialties and was not impressed.  The chicken was under cooked and had an odd taste, not sure if it was the seasoning or not fresh.  Others in my party were OK with their shrimp and seafood dishes but nothing special.< /review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>Welcomed at the door with smiling faces and compliments towards my baby niece, this is our last night in Coronado and we were craving some Asian food.  Sat down and we’re quickly asked for drink orders, we both ordered a beer, kung pow chicken, Nigri and 1 sushi roll.. after that 20 mins later we received our beers (I got the wrong size but chose not to complain) ! Across from us a gentleman sat down probably 30 mins after  us and within 10 mins he got his rice,  chicken meal and ... A SUSHI ROLL!!!  After we stopped our waitress which had not been to our table in atleast 10 and had been serving the other man she said “I’m so sorry there’s a big party and it’s backed up in the kitchen” it was 6 people come on. Plus you just served someone before us and we have a child. After stopping another waitress we told her our sisuation and she had our waitress come to us and say “sorry the sushi is done were just waiting for the chicken”... which my sister in law was quick to reply well can you please atleast bring that. Who knows how long this raw fish had been sitting and I hope there’s no food poisoning before the flight. Couldn’t figure who was the supervisor amongst the tennage girls walking around. But thankful for getting the bigger beer cause it lasted the whole hour waiting for our dinner.

What a bummer for our last dinner, thanks<//Review>< user>

Really good "people watching" views (able to bring your dog and sit outside).

Food was decent tasting, drinks were tasty and at a reasonable price for Coronado.

Overall a good experience.</text>

Sub par food and unfriendly service. This place has Chinese food in loc for the "island" due to it being the only place to get it except for the frozen food section at Vons. I guess the question if want to cook or not. Taste about the same!</Text>

<text>in the last week

i was treated well the first 2 visits. On the third visit i was treated pretty awful at the bar by a bossy lady who wasnt helpful at all and was rude. and there is tennis match on i say i am going for the American guy and this was offensive to these people. be nice please!

they dont have any healthy salads here.  nothing to go with the pad Thai.  i asked for a small salad and the  obnoxious lady at bar is completely inflexible.

wont be back!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Walked here from the Glorietta Bay Inn Hotel, which is awesome btw, and got some yellowtail and albacore nigiri then a Volcano roll and Coronado roll. Highely recommend the Volcano! But everything was amazing. Great Sushi bar and restaurant!  Our server Emerald was very sweet and helpful!  Can't wait to come back.< /Review>< response>

Not the best chinese, and not the cleanest if you look beyond the seating areas. Maybe it was just that day, but we went there one time. We are not going back. I hope others see something different.< /review>

There's a reason I stopped going to jack unfortunately McDonald's was close so I had no other option. I got the spicy chicken sandwich and it the chicken was like a chicken nugget it was just the bun and the fact that is $6 for the burger itself is outrageous. For sure not going back.<//review>

I really enjoy my food here today,
Spicy Chicken sandwich, curly fries and Oreo Milk shake. Service was also great.</Review>

Personally, I loved them, the drinks don't taste like tv static, and the lettuce and tomatoes added on most of their burgers are fresh, (unlike mcdonalds) and they're definitely not for everyone, but their food is still amazing.<//review>

Sandwich was half the size they advertised. Fries were hard and extra greasy. Drink was flat and tasteless. I usually give you the benefit of the doubt. But I feel left down.</Text>

I know that this is fast food and you get what you pay for! I guess food poisoning is on the menu cause they've had a pallet of perishables baking in the sun for just under an hour. Which Is no good. The staff are nice though.</text>

Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich through the mobile app. The chicken fillet was burnt and dry and my egg roll was barely warm. I was the only customer there. They could have at least made it fresh and not have given me ones of the ones that was already sitting there for half an hour.</review>

I had not been to Jack in awhile so I had time to kill before work  so I decided to go in...wow! Things have changed the breakfast sandwich was so greasy..  but orange juice good. And their tacos, egg rolls, and pitas will always be good. Just not sure about breakfast sandwiches.</review>

I would give it negative one! If I could. Its like the quality of how they prepare your food is so much worse than before. Burnt Patty's, cold fries. Even my 5 yr old didnt want his food. Multiple time buying here and it's only getting worse. We wont be going back to this facility. The food is disgusting!</Review>

The food at Jack in the Box is always amazing! They have a huge variety of burgers and other foods. I also like that all of their breakfast menu is available all day unlike McDonald's where only selected breakfast menu are available all day. The place is always clean and the staff are really nice and friendly. The food doesn't take too long to come out and our orders always come out exactly how we wanted it. I definitely recommend coming here and I will be coming more often!< /text>

<Review>The food is like other places, sitting area as well as drinking station is clean but what was disturbing to me and my guests it was the limited time we were slow to dine there. They have a sign of 30 minutes seating limit ( Is this Jack in the Box's role?? I don't think so) and it was funny because it took cashier over 25 minutes to take the order and prepare the food. So we had to eat and leave in 5 minutes.
I am hoping Jack in the Box management watch their locations and personal roles that applies to their stores!<//Review>< Pics>

It was decent at best. There's a good chance they might mess up your order, and the drinks are way too diluted (everything tastes like water). The McDonalds down the street is probably the better option.</Text>

This Jack In The Box has been in this town for a good amount of years. It has considerably improved both in service and cleanliness. The management seems to care a lot more about appearances than in years prior. I can now enjoy a meal inside of the restaurant instead of just rushing into the drive thru.< /review>

A bit slow coming to the register to take my order and not very enthusiastic about serving me but the sandwich was still okay. Six dollars for a breakfast sandwich is too experience though.<//review>

Surprised, and not in a good way, on how slow the service I received was and the inappropriate conversations had among the employees. But I can forgive that. What I can't wrap my mind around is how little resources this place seems to have. My tacos had tiny pieces of cheese and a few strips of lettuce. The soda machine had no ice. And my medium fries had about half a size worth of fries missing. What's going on? I'm hangry!</review>

It was closed at 11 and 1145 am!! I could not believe at lunch time it was closed I was not pleased and was not able to have my new Philly cheesesteak. Or any lunch.  I told them I didn't need any hot water on my sandwich but they didn't see the humor.  Wow!! Unbelievable 👎  what's going on jack?<//text>

The late night staff with the exception of one young lady are super unprofessional. They let a drunk dude person post up and fall asleep in the drive through for who knows how's long, I get there and I call the police and the night supervisor runs outside to wake up the sleeping person obviously drunk to leave. Then the person in the car falls asleep at the stop light for three green lights. ..thank you for letting a drunk driver possibly kill himself or other people...< /review>

(Translated by Google) Hello, good morning, how are you? Good evening, good evening. I invite you to this place and to eat your delights. The rich and delicious burgers of Jack the Box are really delicious. It's a bit expensive. But it's good because the hamburgers are good. I hope and come and enjoy
