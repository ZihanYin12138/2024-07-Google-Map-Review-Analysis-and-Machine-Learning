<Review>Dr. Lorber and his staff are exceptional!
This is the only veterinary office that I or my family have been to that doesn’t feel like you are being “taken for a ride” and charged for overpriced or unnecessary tests or procedures. They do what is necessary for your pet and they are good at explaining why they are doing it. Their communication over the phone is good and their Covid-safe check-in procedure is efficient.
On a personal note, my family has an extremely high level of trust and appreciation for everyone at Helix. We know that we will be charged fairly. We know that the staff adore and care about our dogs. And we are so grateful that even though this is a busy office, they always find time to fit our dogs in to give them the care that they need. I recommend these awesome people all the time and I will continue to do so. I think I’ll send them a Christmas basket or something this year.< /Review></record>

<text>Staff and Dr. Was extremely compassionate when we took our senior dog in and had to put him to rest. I would recommend this place to everyone! Thanks everybody for your caring and comfort in such a difficult time.</text><Rating>5<//Rating><date>1573939000609< /date>< user_name>

I can’t even put into words how wonderful this practice is. Dr. Lorber and his staff have always been kind and treated our animals as if they were their own. They are essentially family at this point. Our animals love them and so do we. Couldn’t ask for a better vet !!!</Text>

The staff are very friendly. The Dr. isn’t as knowledgeable. I asked him a bunch of questions since I’m a new puppy mom and he didn’t have straight answers. A lot of “it doesn’t matter” answers. I had specific questions and he didn’t have the specific answers. Took my pup to another vet and they answered all my questions very specifically. Also, the Dr. almost gave my puppy a shot HE ALREADY HAD & didn’t care to confirm what vaccinations he got since the information was in Spanish. If you weren’t sure, why not confirm with me??? Not a pleasant experience with the Dr. specifically.<//Text>

<Date>1547855276456<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Dr. Lorber is the best Vet I have been associated with during the last 30 years.  He inherited the care of my Dolly and Daisy (mother/daughter chihuahua mixes). They moved to the large vet hospital from the small in a remodeled home on University Ave.  After the owner started the large vet hospital, he continued to care for Dolly and Daisy.  Shortly after he sold the practice, Dr. Lorber took over care of my Dolly and Daisy.  He helped them grow old peacefully (Dolly-18 yrs; Daisy - 18 1/2 yrs).  I strongly recommend Helix Pet Hospital to anyone that truly values a caring and genuine approach to veterinary medicine. All of the staff have been kind, caring and yet professional. The names I remember best are Zack, Patrick and Jeanine.  However, everyone who works there is deserving of recognition.  Thank all of you so much!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5DJ71ngaf4vBB3QufI3K1cEmHPTXt9rilh2_O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO48kARcoUNh28sF_kFanRKefwXupluZEhUPvw7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVxjI34cfTYLw1R6bVKyBMCIws3xD1Fskey_dv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4NUijh8iPXBjM6y1ihXECu-E9nD7NF7oMqxEn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

When you come here they treat you like family. The compassion they show for you and your fur baby is top notch. Dr. Lorber provides excellent care for an affordable price. He always starts out with the lower cost test and moves up to the more expensive ones if it’s needed. Most vets will do the opposite. I love the attention and love her provides my dog when ever he sees her. I would recommend him to anyone. I wish I would have found Helix Pet Hospital sooner. Thank you for helping this crazy dog mama out in a time if need. I appreciate it!! Also, Patrick is amazing.<//Review>

<review>The veterinarian didn't tell me about the potential side effects of the 6 month pro heart injection. My dog got violently ill 48 hours after the shot and was to the point where there was blood in the vomit.  Then when I go to the vet to follow up he tells me not look up pro heart side effects online.

They did start off great with my dog but the prices are high and I wasn't warned about the side effects of the injection.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The staff are friendly and accommodating especially through this pandemic.

Our friend recommended them as they take their dog to Helix Pet Hospital.

We’ve received exemplary care for check ups, shots and vaccines, and accommodated for an urgent visit!

They’re awesome!<//review>

Been going here for about 20 years since I was a kid. Never had a single issue. Staff is all very friendly. The vet doc is very clinically intelligent and confident in his assessments, diagnoses, and recommended treatments, which is something I appreciate. A no nonsense kind of guy, straight to the point, runs the labs, gets stuff done stat. Cost always seems very fair. I would recommend Helix Pet Hospital to anyone looking for a vet. I know I'll keep bringing my dogs here for as long as they stay open.< /Text>

Dr. Lorber is very honest and caring, and does a great job taking care of your pets. He is the only one who can handle my temperamental cat. He is also very cost conscious and does his best to make veterinary care affordable. The staff goes the extra mile as well-I called (without identifying myself as a client) to inquire if they were able to perform a specialized procedure for cats. The person on the line said they didn’t, and she wasn’t sure who did. No big deal, it’s not a common procedure. A few hours later she called me back and she had found a place where I could have it done. How awesome is that? Just shows you what a special place this is.<//Review>< pictures>

They worked with me on what I could afford and still made sure my cat got the treatment he needed. I would highly recommend to any pet owners! Thank you Dr. Lorber and your wonderful staff!<//review>

<text>Dr. Lorber and his Team will take excellent care of your pet.  He is such a wonderful Vet, I followed him from his old practice.  I happily switched from driving 5 minutes to his old place to driving 20 minutes to The Helix Pet Hospital.  I would not trust Higgins, my dog, to anyone else.  Most pets are nervous while at the Vet, but once Dr. Lorber comes into exam room, Higgins calms down and is my happy, little dog again.

He tore his ACL and needed surgery.  Dr. Lorber referred us to a great surgeon, helped me set up rehab and his Team made sure that all of the different people involved in his care were kept up informed of his progress.

If you are looking for a Vet that you can truly trust, then call The Helix Pet Hospital.  Your pet deserves the best and everyone here is the best!< /text>< date>

<username>Wendy Hurt< /username><user_id>111558911753821234228<//user_id><Text>My two fur babies (dogs) and I love Dr. Lorber (the new owner and Veterinarian of Helix Pet Hospital)!

We have been seeing him for 7 years.  I was referred to him by another veterinarian who was getting ready to retire. This vet had nothing but great things to say about him.  True to his word, Dr. Lorber did a thorough exam and put me at ease.  My older rat terrier didn’t have cataracts, but a neurological problem that would slowly cause blindness.  There is no cure for this at this time.  I was so glad I saw him for a second opinion!

When I learned that Dr. Lorber had decided to start his own practice, of course we had to follow him!  My 2 fur babies are older: a 15 year old rat terrier and a 9 year old standard poodle (who was the biggest crush on him!).  It’s a good feeling to know that my dogs love visiting him!

The new Helix Pet Hospital is more of a “boutique” experience, where it’s a very personal experience for you and your pet!< /Text>< Resp>

Ryan Lorber, DVM, has established his private practice to care for all pets. He brings a warm, welcoming attitude and years of experience to every encounter. He provides the best care to our cat. We have followed him across town to stay with him.< /review>

Extraordinary Pet Hospital.  Dr. Lorber and his staff are incredibly compassionate and kind. Everyone is professional and focus on optimum customer service for the pet and the owners.  Recently had my fur baby there for surgery and they took great care of him from the moment he arrived and then followed up with phone calls days after he was home to check on him.  For those concerned about price, this is the lowest and best quality pricing I have found and believe me I looked around. They are reasonably priced with all their services.  Don't bother looking elsewhere this facility is the best.  Also, very super clean, the metal tables in the pet treatment rooms are even draped with soft blankets and puppy quilts, like how sensitive can you be to small animals that are already scared to be at the Vet.  Extraordinary team and great staff, I finally found my GO -TO- VET!< /Review>

<Review>Took my 9 year old dog in to get checked out and get all her shots and they were very friendly. The vet explained things very well and the place was nice and clean. The receptionist was very friendly as well. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star and not 5 is because they take your dog back to some other room when they do anything with them.  I'm used to being able to hold my pet while they are getting shots to ease the stress of a new place and the pain of shots so that I didn't really care for. All in all, I will be coming back.< /Review></record>

I love this place!  Dr.Lorber is taking an excellent care of my dog Sammy for years, so when I heard he joined the Helix Pet Hospital, there was no question  for my determination to follow him there, even it means a longer commute. Sammy's case is very complicated and requires intense communication with various specialists ( internist, neurologist, ophtalmologist)to make sure the team is on the same page with his medications , exams, etc. I am a physician -psychiatrist from Europe living in this country for over a decade, and even if I don't practice in the U.S. , I can tell very well the difference between providers . Dr. Lorber does an amazing job of having the treatment team communicating and informed, getting me Sammy's updates ASAP, being so compassionate and caring, knowledgeable about the latest research findings -  I couldn't hope for a better vet ! Our furry animals are our babies , so for all of you beautiful souls and animal lovers who are reading  this review right now, I strongly believe that your baby will be in  best hands. Go Team, Helix Pet Hospital, love ya!<//review>

This Vet!  I cannot sing his praises enough!  We are a military family and in all the states we have lived in, I have had a terrible time finding a Vet like the one back home.  Dr. Dowell not only cares for my baby as much as I do, but also respects me as a source of information on my 14 year old cat and not just a wallet.  I expected that moving to a city full of dogs would provide me with plenty of options for quality Vetrinarians, but wow San Diego... Luckily I was referred to Dr. Dowell by a friend and I owe her so much!  Finding this place lifted so much stress off my sholders.  Everyone there is so nice, I highly recommend them!< /text>

Dr. Dowell and his staff @ Helix Pet Hospital are absolutely the BEST In San Diego County!
Dr. Dowell is extremely knowledgeable and and up to date in the latest technologies in your pets care and needs. From prevenative healthcare to surgeries and beyond you can't find a better or more caring veterinarian than Dr. Dowell. He's wonderful  at thoroughly explaining in detail any given situation to you and taking his time to make sure you fully understand whatever is going on with your loving pet. He's very loving and caring with your pet and he treats them as if they were his own. I have three Labrador Retrievers and all three of my babies absolutely adore Dr. Dowell. They never get nervous going to see Dr Dowell, as a matter of fact they look forward to see him and his loving staff.
I have made many recommendations to friends and family to Helix Pet Hospital and everyone I have referred to him has thanked me tremendously for helping them find their permanent pets doctor. After just one visit with Helix Pet Hospital you too will feel exactly the same.
Thankyou again Helix Pet Hospital for all the wonderful, loving care you have given our fur babies throughout the years, you truly are a God send. ♡< /review>

<Date>1376099693866<//Date><rating>1</rating><Review>I received terrible service.  The night before I had taken my three month old puppy to the emergency room, they faxed everything to this vet.  The next day I did receive a follow up voicemail.  When I arrived at the vets with my dog I was questioned as to why I had not returned their voicemail.  I explained my busy situation, not one question was asked about my puppy's visit to the emergency room. When asked what I wanted them to do, I explained that the emergency room didn't know what was wrong with my puppy and I was asked if we wanted the parvo test.  I stated that I had called two days before I was told that my puppy had a parvo test and it came back negative on the 30th of July.  Immediately a woman came around and told me that wasn't was she said, it was a vaccine, I said no I specifically asked you if the test was negative and you said yes, she began to argue with me.  I changed the conversation to ask if the vet would please see if they could find anything wrong with our puppy.  They took her and said that they would call me.  I explained that I was going in to have a root canal and should be done around four and asked when they were closed.  I said I would call and was told that they close at six and would call me and leave a voicemail.  When I left the dentist at 4:10, I had two voicemails, one at 2:25 and the other at 4:00, I called the vets office and was told that the doctor wanted to take xrays, do parvo test and a blood test.  After hearing the cost, I said last night at the emergency room the doc didn't feel that an xray was needed.  I asked the person on the phone I could only afford one and if she could ask the vet which would he prefer the xray or the parvo test.  She said I am sure the vet would go with the xray, I asked again, can you please ask the vet.  She then began to scold me on the phone about not returning her two voicemails in the afternoon and the one from the morning.  I explained that I was having a root canal and them that prior to leaving my puppy and again explained about my busy morning.  I asked to speak to the vet, then I was told that he went home for the day and I should of called back when she had called me prior, it was only 4:15.  I told her I wanted to just pick up my puppy and go elsewhere.  She said okay and hung up on me.  When I arrived at the vets, my puppy was handed to me in their towel and dog bed.  I was then chased through the lobby by another worker there, saying she wanted their items back, I said this is how she was given to me.  She took my puppy and all items back into the back and brought my puppy out in the original towel I brought her in, except the towel was wet.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I stumbled through this Starbucks omw to work when I first moved here, 3 months ago, and of the many locations along my route, this one has been, so far, top notch in friendliness, speed, and accuracy. I look forward to Shelby taking my order & seeing Colleen at the window! They always seem genuine in conversation and I have yet to leave without a smile, let alone a good cup of coffee.😊</Text>

My favorite Starbucks in Lincoln. The only Starbs in town with a Drive Thru although I only mobile order. My drink is right 95 percent of the time and the staff is always friendly. The wait time is CRAZY sometimes but probably because everybody prefers this location.</text>

<review>Today was an odd day and I left after 30 minutes without my drink that I had mobile ordered. I left because I had to get to work. I will be calling the manager later. They had enough staff but the wrong staff was expediting. Not a very good morning for anyone there I was not the only one waiting more than 30 minutes< /review>< pictures>

Over priced coffee. But, the staff is kind and they get your drink right most days. The drive thru is super busy right now because no one wants to go inside. Although, the cafe dinning area is open.</text>

Great spot to hang out with my friends and the workers are nice. Baristas haven’t ruined my drink yet. Consistent and great customer service goes a long way. I would recommend coming here if you’re in the area.< /text>

It was my birthday, so I didn't want to miss out on my Venti Mocha Frappacino with 2 extra shots floated for free. It is delicious by the way. I like starbucks because of the consistancy across there customer facing outlets. I have no complaints about this particular store front, the staff was friendly and attentive.  Mostly younger  adults working here and they did a great job.< /review>

<review>I order the same drink every time ! This Starbucks never gets it right 2/5 times I’ll have my drink correct. I don’t understand how you can order a drink the same every time and every time the drink is different and completely off. I’ve even talked to the manager there and they offered no help but a apology. Starbucks is suppose to be my savior in the morning but instead they piss me off every time. So over it !< /review></record>

<text>Oscar, Chad, and Cassidy were awesome at the Lincoln crossing store. I was having trouble with my app to get my order going close to closing time and they were super helpful even though it probably dug a bit into their personal time. Seriously the first review I have ever left and it’s because of their awesomeness. Thanks!!!< /text>< pictures>

<text>The drinks are usually good, just depends on who's making it. The staff always seems stressed out, probably because they're busy. The carmel frap. Is my fav. Getting pretty pricey for what it is. On my opinion Dutch bros is a better product for the money.</text>< Rate>

< Review>
Stopped in the morning and bought two bistro boxes--one for the drive into Sacramento, one for "lunch".  I was shocked to find my box (at lunch) moldy, very disgusting.  It smelled and I never even opened it.  I stopped in upon returning to Lincoln, CA that evening to bring the box in.   In essence, the three women there called me a "LIAR".  They told me, "That cannot happen because we change these out daily."  I was shocked and realized they thought I was scamming them.  I said, "I do NOT want anything! I'm just telling you what happened to me..."   and left.  But I will NEVER be back. EVER.  Besides, I am trying to avoid Starbucks because they are OVER packaged, OVER priced, and one more huge corporation...    Bad customer service.  This was the THIRD time I had a TERRIBLE experience at THE STARBUCKS on Ferrari Ranch Road. 7/9/13 event. the server in AM was cool. The evening crew (esp. one of them) should GO.<//Review>

Terrible Starbucks! This place has one of the worst drive thrus ever. A simple drink takes over ten minutes to get and then they make it wrong. I live down the street so out of convenience I come here, but after the consistent mess ups I will drive to another one.</Text>

So I went to Starbucks and asked for a Carmel macchiato blended and they had made it iced so I politely asked for them to remake my drink blended. With a rude response I was told yes. And had thrown it into the blender with a few peaces of ice and handed back to me runny and watered down.</text>

<text>It was absolutely terrible there were only three girls working in the store. They were just talking and gossiping about customers. They were taking cups and trying to drop kick then in the garbage can. They dropped the cups and I overheard the barista say that she was to lazy to print another label so she just used the same cup that was on the floor and gave it to the customers. It made me so mad. I would rate it 0 but that is not an option. Also the service was terrible I ordered a tall strawberry acai refresher and a tall strawberry banana smoothie and it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. This has been my worst Starbucks experience so far. I've been to many Starbucks stores before, and I've never had such a negative and discussing experience. All the Starbucks I've been to were great except for this one.< /text></record>

This is a good Starbucks, attached to a mini mall and accompanied by an AT&T, GNC, and GameStop. Free WiFi, peaceful nook for studying, and plenty of looky-loos lurking about. Beware.< /Text>

Just pathetic.
Says they can’t warm up a donut because I can get burnt
And your drinks can’t burn people’s mouth or a toasted bagel?
It’s so silly I had to write.< /review>

I had a horrible experience going to the Chanel Store on Robertson Blvd. I went to the store with 3 friends and waited in line to enter. We were told that only a party of up to 3 people could work with a sales associate. We decided to split our group into 2 pairs, so that each pair could work with a sales associate. The first pair of friends went in with a sales associate, and my other friend and I continued to wait in line to work with another sales associate. An associate came to us and told us to come in; however, she told us to come in and sit in their courtyard area until the first pair of friends were done so that we can begin shopping. We explained that we paired off so we can shop separately and at the same time. The associate said that their policy was that we were all considered one party because she knew we came together, despite us wanting to shop separately. A young family of 3 came in after my friend and I, but they were allowed to begin shopping. I tried to speak with the sales associate again, but she said that I had to wait outside or swap with my friend. I became upset with this experience, so my friend and I left. I texted my other friends who were already shopping that we had left because the sales associate would not let us work with someone at the same time. I do not understand why my friend and I waited in line longer to only be seated in the courtyard area. I believe we should have worked with our own sales associate. The policy is so confusing and definitely made me not want to shop at this boutique ever again. It also makes me have a lower opinion of the brand as well. I understand Covid safety for the limits on parties; however, my friend and I decided to be separate. Plus, our first pair of friends were looking at handbags, while my friend and I were going to look at men's wallets. We would have been on different sections of the store. This boutique lost a customer.< /Text>

It is my obligation and my respect to this beautiful brand that I write a  review about a nightmare experience I had at the Chanel store on Robinson Boulevard.  The only thing I can say is, thank God I got my bracelet back.  I gave it for repair and I had to wait for more than 2 months to get it back. Every time I called, they would tell me that it is on its way. They made me pay twice for the repair: the first time I paid $100 when they took the item and then they made me pay $105 when I picked it up insisting very aggressively that I did not pay the first time. I asked them to check the security cameras, but with a very snobby tone said that I have not paid. The store is managed by the person who is training her associates to be snobby, liars and thieves. I do not blame the associates. It is the management who has such a poor respect towards this brand and operate this beautiful store with such a disgrace. All this for $100!!</review>

The personnel at Chanel was great. Each customer was helped by one employee. They were given the freedom to look in browse and when they were ready they were there to answer questions and help check them out. It was fun to be treated like royalty. one expensive shopping trip but well worth it< /review>

Worst boutique ever.. made me wait for 30 min outside and people inside completely ignored me. At the end, a lady finally came out to just tell me that I should make an appointment and come back.</Review>

<review>This Chanel store discriminates at its finest! I came here and made a appointment and they still wouldn’t allow me inside because there was a 2 people limit according to the Asian worker of this Chanel boutique , but what I found amusing was that they allowed in a group of Asian’s I would say 4 people in total and there want a limit for them . Hmmm makes you think . I would like to speak to the manager of this location and get things right . This is abysmal.< /review>< username>

Omg , where do I begin? I called Chanel looking for a bag for my sister. I wasn’t sure on design and size. Thank goodness a very sweet sales  representative  Michele helped me and explain the bag I was looking for. Not have she been very helpful but she was very professional. She had showed me the difference between the small and medium boy bag. She had gone out her way to send me pictures. I recommend anyone that shop at this location to ask for Michele. She’s very helpful patience and sweet. I couldn’t thank Michele for this beautiful boy bag I just purchase. I’ll definitely will be a returning customer.<//Review>

<review>Very disappointed with the service.  We love Chanel product. And we searched in google MAP and found this location. We walked in this store, have a few simple questions. And the conversation with the sale representative less than 2 mins. Ready to commit and make the purchase.  And there is another lady want to purchased the bag and that sale representative immediately ignore myself and my wife. (because she want to purchased COCO Chanel Bag $4000 and up.) (But today we just want to pick up a simple Chanel Wallet $1000 + plus )and left us hanging.  I understand and respect the fact that is all "about business".  But where is the customer service / principle, and curtesy. To me that is completely RUDE.  Very disappointed.  Do I need to make a purchase of $5000 or more every time to get a red carpet treatment? Finally another sale representative (Josh) came by and asked have we been help.  We told Josh. "yes we did and our sale representative left us and help other customer. We didn't make any statement at the time. I would not recommend to go this location. If you don't plan to make a big purchase transaction.  Good luck.<//review>< Pics>

Ne venez surtout pas ici. Ce magasin n'a rien d'une boutique de luxe, j'ai acheter tout mes articles à Paris Montaigne et je n'avais jamais vu un tel manque de professionnalisme dans le monde du luxe c'est très décevant. Le magasin ferme officiellement à 6:00pm mais il s'autorise à refuser des clients à partir de 5:00pm une heure avant sans aucun motif qui a du sens et bien sûr il ne tiennent pas compte du fait que vous ayez fait de la route pour vous rendre à leur place ouverte officiellement. Le manager vous rigole au nez et vous demande comment c'est possible de vouloir autant rentrer dans le magasin, ce qui est un manque de respect après avoir fait autant de route pour absolument rien et perdre mon temps devant cette boutique, un manager vraiment pas à l'image de la marque. D'ailleurs il prétends avoir travailler à Paris Montaigne et prétends qu'à Paris ici il laisse les gens dehors avant l'heure d'ouverture (un énorme mensonge) c'était la première fois que je voyais ça toute boutique confondu.< /review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>The owner and the service staff were friendly and helpful in regards to maintenance questions and there was a sales person who would greet and offer folks help in regards to new bicycles. Seems this store has a large following as it was really busy when I was there. But, I gave a mediocre rating due to that the final price I was charged was significantly more than the original estimate that was given regarding a service job I had done for a tune-up, install new thicker inner tubes, and some slime to prevent small punctures. The only reason I tried this shop was to use a 10% off coupon and I had another $10 coupon that was sent in the mail. The cashier said I could use both coupons but they did not reduce the price by much as my jaw hit the floor when I heard the final price.  I didn't want to raise-hell about the final price as times are tough due to COVID and the shop did do a nice service job.  One other issue is the entrance/exit is really narrow where only one person can comfortably walk in and out of the store at a time. As for me, I think this is a one and done visit. I guess I'll go back to Cyclery USA who have more reasonable prices.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c33314cf73a74b:0x80b19a8edf5ab3c0<//Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
As an avid cyclist, the only place I go in Chino is Incycle. I bike on average 20 miles a day and being the summer time, goatheads are nearly impossible to avoid in some form or fashion. They have all the needed parts and a great customer service. The service bay in the back is also exceptional. Overall a great place to go for all cycling needs.</Review>

Went here thinking it would be a wonderful place but I paid for silver to get my bicycle serviced just to have my brakes still rub so a couple weeks later I get a flat go back today get a new inner tube installed just for him to tell me my tire has a slight wobble so I asked isn't that something you guys would have fixed with the silver package he says yeah we should have but I don't remember your bike I literally still had the tag they placed in my bike when they serviced it then he says it's only $25 like I didn't just pay $150 but okay whatever no big deal I ride home just to have another flat when I get home closed on Monday now I need to go back Tues and get it serviced free of charge man it's like they don't want my money</text>

Great store, awesome staff very helpful. Issac helped me this morning grab brakes and tires and grips and checked me out all in 5 minutes, then I brought it back later to get brakes adjusted and they took only 15 mins and 15$ to finish the brake adjustment and cutting cables:)<//review>

<Text>I hardly ever review but I felt like the service we received from Avery was AWESOME!! She was super accommodating and made our experience so much better than the other incycle stores we have been to. So happy after many many trips to bike shops we ended up here, will definitely be coming back.

<Text>I can no longer recommend this chain as I was led to believe I had a warranty claim after paying them $$ to troubleshoot only to have them deny the claim. I kind of understand the deny of claim with Roval, but not the misleading me and not communicating after weeks on end. Cody is a solid tech there but leadership is poor and deflects blame. It’s too bad as they are local to me. There is much more but you get the idea. I hope your experience is better than mine! Thanks< /Text><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

Great customer service and inventory. Helpful people who care about bicycles and go out of their way for you. Was just in to deal with what could have been an aggravating issue and was impressed by how all the staff and owner Dominic are handling themselves in the COVID crisis. Thanks guys!< /Review>

Today was my second time back here with a really positive experience. Guys here are really helpful and fast. Made me feel good about my bike even though it is just a clunker. Best thing was the part and labor cost more than fair. Great value. Great place. Awesome selection of bicycles. For any bicycle needs ... This is the place.< /Review>

Nice and friendly shop. Very helpful with anything i asked or needed. Prices were reasonable and they didn’t offer anything not needed. I Without a doubt recommend this shop over any other one. Also the employees are very real, they talk to you and you forget your in a shop.<//review>

And every associate seemed to be hanging out or carrying a conversation with regulars not helping them just talking.</review>< Response>

I dont leave reviews alot especially negative but I called incycle this afternoon to finda lead time on getting  wheel trued. I guess I spoke to one of the owners Don and was told to bring it in if its not bad we can do it while you wait. Well my wheel is not bad so I pulled it off and rushed up to Incycle only to be told that I would have to drop it off and it would be atleast a week and a half. That Don really doesn't know whats going in in the shop.   When a employee let alone one of the owners tells a customer something.. You make it happen.   Needless to say they lost me as a customer.</Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Im a new customer here, I brought in my Giant bike in to get the brake line replaced. It wasn't cheap but im sure it was priced accordingly, im just not used to spending $150 on work done for a bike. But my gripe is that Once I came in to pick up my bike , I must of stood around infront of the work area for 15 minutes or so before I was even acknowledged. Took another 15 minutes to get my bike. Then I bought hand gripes for it and it took another 25 minutes to get my bike. They need to focus and acknowledged the customers in the store and try to get us serviced faster. Be conscious of the customers Time. Took an hour to pick up a bike and have the hand grips cut!</Text>< Pictures>

<text>By far worst incycle location out of the ones around. I was told they'd have a bike available for me next day and when I showed up they had sold it to another person. They tell you one thing and then change their story the next time. Don't go here go to San Dimas or rancho.<//text></record>

This place is great and the staff is cool and welcoming. Brought in a rusty old school Schwinn and they cleaned it up and helped me upgrade tires and install some parts I already had. I recommend bringing your bike here especially if your trying to give and old bike some life.</review>

<Review>The staff is awesome, I hope the management reads these reviews because their store staff is what keep customers coming back to their store. I can't say enough good things about the service I have received - they very definitely stand behind the products they sell and are very knowledgeable and eager to help you find a bike that suits you and your budget. I really recommended Incycle!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Terrible service. Dominic, Raul and Megan are all full of themselves. They like to profile their customers. If they tell you they will follow up on something you can forget about it. They won’t call you.... you have to follow up with them. Then they laugh about it. What a joke this place is. Try San Dimas.... they’re more attentive and friendly</review>

Beautiful park with great views. The baseball fields are turf. Picnic tables and water fountains by each baseball field and a little tot play area make it very convenient during games. The batting cages are well maintained. Nice trailsin the hills behind, just watch for snakes!</review>

I was surprised to find this so close to home in Westlake Village. I saw a bunch of baseball fields and a large area to practice I think football. There is also a YMCA which I think it is closed due to Coronavirus. However behind the fields I noticed that there are a few different trails that you can go hiking on, they are actually open right now and I did not get a chance to go very far on one but it seems like a really nice hike. I will definitely be back to check it out!< /Review>

None of that Mexican style Cantina. While I do like the food and enjoy the place the layout is a little funky. I recommend going for the taco Tuesday special. You really do get a big bang for your buck on the tacos are delicious. Wait staff is always been very friendly and top-notch.< /Text>

The food is great and reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  Great family restaurant with separate bar area that is awesome.  You'll love this place.</review>

<Text>This restaurant is located in a strip mall. The restaurant is clean and efficiently run. The table service was very good. The dish I was served was a combination of a taco, rellano, beans and rice. The meal was good.< /Text>< pictures>

And they even charged us for chips and salsa. Really it's a Mexican restaurant and you are going to charge for chips and salsa.  20% of the menus is wrong including the happy hour. I swore I would never go here again because the last time I was here I watched the server put his hands to his mouth then put paper and chips in a basket then fix fountain drinks before bringing it to a table. They should be reviewed by food and beverage.  Does everyone who work's  there even have food handlers cards. I don't have time to list all the reasons you should not go here!<//text><Date>1562218866624</Date>< gmap_id>

Not worth your time or money. Service was sub par. To be fair though, I think he was new. The other employees looked totally disinterested in doing their jobs. I saw one waiter biting his nails as he was walking up to a table. I'm sure if the customer would have seen that, they would have left.
Their "Lava Cake" dessert is a joke! Very small piece of bland cake with a small scoop of ice cream. Chili's does it better.
Avoid this place at all costs!< /text>

Good spot, recently has gone down hill a little.... use to be best chips/salsa, now they suck. Tacos also were the best, no longer.... maybe they will change back to the way they started out, otherwise there are other places.</Text>

<text>Hands-down, the best Taco Tuesday I've been to. Been twice now, and both times the tacos were AMAZING and you can't beat the price ($2.50 each for the large ones, $2 for street ones). I haven't tried the street tacos, but the large, crispy and soft tacos are fabulous (what place still serves large tacos on Taco Tuesday for $2.50 each?). Not just meat and the tortilla, mind you; fried shells (or not) to perfection, topped with ample lettuce, cheese, and fresh pico de gallo. 2 or 3 are filling enough, in my opinion.

That said, the service has been a little slow, but it's not the fault of the workers. There were only two serving the whole restaurant and bar. I think hiring 1 extra person (esp on busier nights) is worth the investment. THAT SAID, the quality of the food was worth a little extra wait.

I will be back for more tacos.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>103504285420601165083</UserId.></record>

Came in yesterday and the service was great. Chicken burrito with red sauce was just OK and with an iced tea and tip, lunch was $20. They do have lunch specials for a little less.</Text>

The new menu is great.  Just another example of how the new owners are taking in customer feedback and making changes.

There are now some "fit" options, as well as some higher end menus items.<//review>

Service was slow, food was cold, and had rusty water dripping on one of us. Food was hit or miss. Taquitos were good, enchiladas were gross. Salsa was quite good. Overall it did not feel very professional. Maybe the bar scene is better but for lunch it should be avoided.</text>

~~~~~Food~~~~~
I've only had a few things on the menu so far, but I have been extremely impressed with it all so far.
---The Chicken Flautas were literally the best flautas I have ever had in my life and it is usually a go-to item for me at Mexican restaurants.  The chicken was extremely tender, juicy, and flavorful.  The outside was perfectly cooked.  It was light brown and extremely flaky.
---Bacon Wrapped Cream Cheese Jalapeno's were fantastic, but its hard to go wrong with Bacon and Cream Cheese together
---The Fajitas are also fantastic and very aromatic which is a huge plus and adds to the dining experience.

~~~~~Drinks~~~~~
The bartenders (based on 2 separate experiences at the bar) here are pleasantly sociable and do a great job of taking your needs into attention.  The tap list is great but I think the handmade drinks is where the Cantina really excels.
---Whisky Coke (up sold to Markers Mark) - A great pour for a simple drink.
---Tana Tea - This reminded me of a peach flavored long island style drink even though it used completely different ingredients.  They also make another tea similar to this that is berry flavored.  I tried some of the person I was dinning with and was pleased as well.
---Margarita - Fantastic.  They don't try to get too fancy with it and that is why it is so good.  They keep a classic, a classic and its all the better for it.

~~~~~Overall~~~~~
Amazing Restaurant and one of my new favorites.  I would and have been suggesting this place to many of my co-workers and friends.  You should give it a try too!<//Review>

Just picked up to go as we regularly do. Opened food at home...it's different!
Chile Rellleno is in red sauce...same sauce as enchilada! Terrible!   So my wife called & they said "new management" implementatied menu changes today...and more coming!  Uh, how about telling us when we order food!
We can drink anywhere. The food brought us back in the past. Good luck...we won't be back!</Text>

Horrible food. Don't waste your money. The worst Mexican food I have ever had.  The side of chips we ordered were soggy and drenched in grease.  We also ordered nachos and there were litterly 6 soggy chips in the order.  The chicken in the chicken enchilada looked like cat food.  Really disappointed.  Every thing was covered in grease. Only thing good was the jarred jalapeños. Everything ended up in the trash.< /Text>

We will keep everyone updated as the changes take place through our Facebook page and hope you come back in to check out all the exciting new options that we're making to truly differentiate Yorba Cantina from the previous restaurants."}<//Response>

<Review>The fajita chicken and Carne Asada cheese crisp was amazing,  the Maui Brewing Co.  Mana Wheat with pineapple beer is off the hook.  The hot salsa isn't so hot you can't assurance it,  but just hot enough to get your nose running.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Friends and I will not be going back.Came from Colorado to visits friends and went to Yorba Cantina for dinner.  The food was tasteless and not good at all.  My carne asada burrito was more like something ground up not steak.< /Review>

Christian is a well experienced nice young gentleman. Willing to listen to our problem and has the patience to find out cause of leaking.  Resolved the problem in no time.  Lucky to have him as the technician from Superior Plumbing today.. I doubt any other technician would be able to resolve the tricky situation we were in.. Thanks to Christian and Superior...<//Text>

<Text>When you have a plumbing issue, you want someone to come out who is knowledgeable, professional, and forthcoming. Andy and the staff at Superior Plumbing are all the above. I had a issue with my plumbing with my old house, and Andy was willing to go above and beyond to help me out. He is clear with his reasoning and perceptive of any issues that may arise. I have only good things to say about my experience.

I appreciated the ease of scheduling an appointment.
I appreciated the assistance from Andy with any of my questions.
I will not hesitate to use Superior Plumbing in the future, and will gladly recommend their services to any family or friends or commercial enterprises in need of phenomenal plumbing services.

Thanks Andy!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I'm not sure why I can't add a 2nd review separately, so I'm just posting my 2nd review on top of my first.  If you see the 1st review, you'll see that I thought everything was okay.  It wasn't .  My tenants continued to have issues and since I had such a great experience with Superior Plumbing the first time, I called them again.  It was bad.  They had to replace the main sewer line.  It was expensive, but not unexpectedly so.  My twin brother had the same issue with his house, so I knew what to expect.   This is not something that is a cheap fix.  What I appreciated was Andy's constant communication with me.  He didn't sugarcoat anything and was honest from the beginning.  He and his crew did the job, and I'm very happy that this is an issue that I won't have to worry about again for a long time!  This is a great company with great employees.  Thank you!

Previous review
I'm giving this company 5 stars not for what they did, but for what they didn't do.  I rent out my house and my tenants contacted me about some plumbing issues.  I called Superior Plumbing and they were able to head over within a few hours.  The person I spoke to was courteous and professional.  I was very impressed so far.  I received a text a few hours later from my tenants saying that the plumber came and that there was no issue.  The plumber told my tenant that probably turning all the faucets on at once was likely enough to flush out the problem.

The company didn't charge me anything for the visit.  Nothing really needed to be done at the visit, but I do know that many plumbers charge you A LOT just for coming.  The fact that Superior Plumbing didn't charge me anything for their visit, and they taught my tenants how to potentially fix future problems too.  What a deal!

This seems to be a company that puts customer service over a quick buck.  If I ever actually need a plumber, they are who I will be calling.  Thank you Superior Plumbing!<//Review>

He was on time and professional.  Christian was sent when the previous technician failed to fixed the problem after being out 2 times and the clean out cap was not put back on properly, leading to kitchen waste water spilling out to the side yard.  Five stars for Christian, four stars for the business for standing behind their warranty and prompt response.  Took away one star for not fixing the problem in one shot.  3 visits in under 30 days is very inconvenient.< /review><resp>None<//resp><rating>4< /rating><date>1599896449097</date><user_id>110460776052903765344< /user_id>< GmapID>

I was lucky with timing and Andy was able to come by within 30 minutes of calling. Our house had a mainline sewer stoppage, which he was able to clean out in 30 minutes.

As we had moved in recently, Andy suspected that the pipe not being used for a while could have dried everything out and made it more prone to blockage.

The total came out to $360, with a 30-day warranty. Hope this helps!</Review>

<Review>The drain line of the bathroom in one of my rentals was clogged after some pipe replacement due to the leak.  Christian tried to snake thru different places.  First went thru the shower drain, then thru the vent on the roof.  None of them seemed to be working, he and the assistant wend under crawl space, disconnected the transition coupling of drain pipe and cleared up the line finally.  Christian didn't make it work the first time, but he came back at another day to complete the task.  I'm impressed with his commitment.  Job well done, two thumps up!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Andy and Steve solved an ongoing plumbing problem that two other companies, after several visits, were unable resolve. I appreciated their perseverance, plumbing knowledge and ability to not give up and walk away as the other two companies did. Both young men are polite, thoughtful, know their business and work in a clean way showing respect for your property.
Superior Plumbing will now be my go to for any future plumbing issues.

We had a small leak issue for one of our toilets. Superior Plumbing responded to my internet form request within an hour and we scheduled an appointment. The plumber showed up in the time slot appointed and were very professional and polite. They took care of the job quickly and charged a very reasonable fee. We will definitely be using them again for future plumbing services!</review>

I highly recommend Christian Gallegos with Superior Plumbing. He talked me through a very complex plumbing issue with multiple problems and provided photos before and after. He is kind, patient and extremely competent. Ours was an emergency situation. Most plumbers give a 4-hour ETA. Superior gives a 2-hour window and contacts you when en route. He prepared an estimate quickly and scheduled the full-day job immediately. Christian worked super hard all day and finished by 6pm. He gave a good price and went out of his way to partner with our warranty company, not something most vendors/plumbers would be willing or have time to do. I really trust Christian.<//review>

I was referred to them by my home warranty company and was very happy with their service (not happy with the state of the water heater in my newly bought house).  They quickly identified the problem and worked to fix it.  As other problems were noticed, they explained everything and what they needed to do.  Would definitely use again!</review>

They replaced cast iron pipes (part of the whole piping network). They were very punctual, courteous, showed me the pics before and after AND finished like they said they would. The pipes work basically made the bathrooms unusable but since they did the work exactly in the timeframe they did, we had no inconvenience at all. It was a good experience. Now, I will know in 6 months, if things are fitted correctly or not :) but I sure they are. It has been a good experience.</review>

Andy and "Junior" (forgot his name already, sorry!) arrived within the service window, completed the quoted work efficiently, and then went above and beyond to save me a bunch of time and trouble by spotting and fixing a problem I didn't realize I had. They were pleasant and professional throughout. I would not hesitate to call Superior Plumbing again.</Text>

We had a recent problem at one of our rental properties -- a clog between the house and the main and a cracked, partially buried, cast iron sewage pipe under the house. To exacerbate the problem, the house has no clean-out. Having some plumbing experience myself, I got on the phone with the guys at Superior Plumbing. I collaborated with Christian at Superior and he came up with an ingenious and economical solution -- install a clean-out that feeds into the main sewage line under the house, instead of digging up the front lawn  to install a clean-out between the house and the main. 24 hours later, we had a new clean-out, the rusty section of sewage pipe was dug out and replaced, and the clog was removed. Not only are these guys total pros and super responsive, but they were super flexible as well --they worked with our insurance company to minimize the cost to us. The next time someone asks me for a plumber recommendation, you know whom I'm going to recommend -- Superior Plumbing.</Text>

Thank you superior plumbing for your service. You do full justice to the name of your company.

Andy helped us out with a leak that we were experiencing coming down into our garage from the washer. I couldn't be happier with the service that we received from him!! He was prompt, knowledgable and so friendly. He diagnosed the problem almost instantly and fixed it quickly the following day. He was also so great and helpful dealing with our insurance company making sure that everything was covered and we didn't have to pay out of pocket. I would 100% recommend Andy and will definitely be using him again if we have any plumbing needs!<//review>

< Review>
Plumbers were an 1 hour & 30 min late to start. The two plumbers who showed up were pleasant and polite. They quoted me $259 to clear a clog in my bathtub - no problem. I figured they would take an hour or two at that rate since it was probably a significant stoppage - not the case. In fact, the clog was quite minor. They finished in 30 min, which isn't an awful thing but they explained that they charge by the difficulty of the job. This didn't seem difficult at all. At this point I was not dissatisfied with the job but I felt a little swindled by what they charged.

I called the owner (Erasmo) to explain the situation but he wasn't having any of it. He could not understand why a customer would be a little perturbed by the rate charge since the difficulty of the job was quite easy. He also didn't seem interested in explaining the reasoning why they charge what they charge and made no attempt to make things right, which is the reason why I'm writing this review. 2 stars for the the plumbers. -1 star for being late and -2 stars for the price and Erasmo.

I will not be using this plumbing service again.< /Review>

Erasmo took care of all my plumbing problems today
Feb. 20, 2019.
He did an excellent job.
Erasmo also installed a new garbage disposal for me.
Erasmo is very kind and
pleasant and a good worker.
I am very happy with the work he did for me today.
I would like to use him again in the future.
Thank you, Superior Plumbing.
Thank you, Erasmo.< /text>

<text>This is my first time using this storage facility and moving across state Jake made it so easy to get set up. He was able to answer all of my questions plus give me more information about the area since I am new to San Diego. The facilities are clean and easy to access. I feel assured that my personal belongings will be safe. Thanks again Jake for making it easy!<//text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

Called to get details on storage rental requirements and spoke to Tamika in the office. She gave me all the info I needed to make an informed decision. I will be visiting the site in Pacific Beach and National City to take a tour for the 2nd time to see what the place looks like after dark.</text>

The facility has cameras but not inside the buildings so if you get robbed like I did, their hands are up in the air. Only way to get in and out is with a code but somehow they let several units be broken into. This place is a joke.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Well, I've been here for years, so I must love it. As a matter of fact, after a few years I added another storage unit.
I take a lot of criticism for having a storage from a friend. She says I have an "apartment for my "stuff"" and it's stuff that I obliviously don't use much because it's in storage. But I get to keep my "stuff" at a much lower rental rate than people pay for their apartments. So it's worth it to me.
The staff at SD Storage are great. They are friendly and they never fail to remind me to pay before I get late fees. [I hate late fees!] Robert and Lisa are really cool! And my first manager--Steve B, he was the best also--really professional and business. And Robert, he's still my courteous friend, even though I gave him a hard time in the past.
I choose SD Storage because they have cement and steel units, which I think is a safer environment for my stuff.
Cheers! to SD Storage on Trousdale! :)< /text>< Date>

I'm a current renter of a storage unit and I have to rank them as the best I've come across. I couldn't be happier starting with location and price. The deal I went for got me a 10 x 10 drive up. Staff members were exceptionally helpful and steered me to an available unit that was shaded for a good part of the day. That suggestion turned out to be invaluable.

My requirements or wish list included a drive up unit, tall ceiling, and I didn't want to check in with the office every time I arrived and left. I got it all at this facility. I punch in my number, unload my stuff, and leave without ever having to waste time and energy signing in and out with the office.

After using several storage facilities over the years, SD Storage is the best for the reasons stated above. I will also add that the facility is secure and located in a quiet industrial area. Also, there is a small Salvation Army donation bin and the facility can collect e-waste.< /Review>

I'm not the type to really write reviews but I like to give credit to where it's due. Katie and Alyssa were amazing and so so helpful! Took my payment with ease while I talked their ears off and actually were responding, generally felt like they cared, and weren't like robots .i know it sounds cheesy but I work in retail myself and I was blow away on how much good vibes I got from them both. Good job girls!! Happy holidays to you and yours!!</Review>

<review>When I went into the National City office, I was immediately greeted with a "Hello" and a smile by Miguel.  He took my non-perishables and entered me into the drawing for the 19th. I noticed he was very courteous and informative to other customers coming in, as well. I needed to get a couple of things from my storage, so I told him I would wait until he finished with another person, and he offered me some water and candy treats.  I am a senior citizen, and to be escorted to my storage gave me such comfort in knowing Miguel cared for my safety.  He also brought a light for me to be able to quickly gather a couple of things I knew where they were.  Thank you, Miguel for having that TLC Customer Service for  Stor'em.< /review>< pics>

Every time I show up and I see Victor and Reina working together I feel at ease knowing that they go above and beyond to help not only me but every tenant that is in the property. If there were a way for them to be able to work together at this property permanently it would bring peace of mind.< /text>

They have great rates compared to other local storage companies and they are publicly traded so you know they mean business.

(Translated by Google) There is a boy who is in the office who is very kind and he took care of me very well. I went to rent a cellar with my son and we went to several places but they all had very bad service. Here I liked a lot and the prices are very accessible. Hugo is seen to be a serious and honest person. Super recommended !!!

He finished the job quickly and at a reasonable price. I can’t think of one complaint visiting a mechanic. The man is very fair and will not exaggerate or take advantage of a situation. His word is his bond< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Mailo is a customer at the restaurant I work at down the street.. Los Molcajetes Restaurant.. so I decided to take my car to him. My car needed a whole new engine. It got swapped out in a week and any questions I have regarding the car he answers them. It was affordable and very professional work. No mickey mouse job. He is also a very honest mechanic. I will be back.</review>< Time>

These mechanics are so great! They don't scam you for your money like other mechanics do. They actually want to help you. Thank you so much! Without them we wouldn't make it home.<//text>

The best service I've ever had in my life! If you need to fix your car you need to read this! Mailo is not only a great mechanic he is also one of the best human beings you will ever meet. My brother and I were headed from Phoenix to San Diego to visit family. A couple miles outside of Fontana, CA our serpentine belt, bearing, and bracket broke and our car overheated. It was Friday night past 8:30 pm and every mechanic we called around town wasn't picking up. Mailo answered our call, it was his wife's birthday and his shop was closed but he told us he would be happy to help us . We had our car towed to his shop and he drove down to his garage after hours to assure us that he could fix the car and everything would be ok. The next morning (Saturday) the part to fix our car arrived but the part company sent the wrong part. Mailo called all over and drove to other part stores to try and find us the part we needed. Nobody had what we needed to fix our car. It was Saturday and Mailo said the soonest anyone could get us the part would be the following Tuesday. Mailo didn't want us to miss spending time with our family so he had his son drive six hours through traffic to the only dealership that had the parts we needed. I was so blown away with how far Mailo and his team were going to help us out. While we were waiting for the parts to arrive Mailo took us out   with him and his wife to their favorite Mexican restaurant. He introduced us to his friends and the owner of the restaurant. Mailo paid for our meal and treated us like we were apart of his family. A couple hours later the part arrived and he had our car fixed very quickly, he could have charged us as much he wanted at that point and I would have gladly paid him. He gave us our bill and it was so reasonable for all the hassle he had to go through to help us. He is the best and most honest mechanic I've ever seen in my life! Mailo personally text us the next morning to check up on us and make sure the car and everything was running good. Mailo is a man of faith and is as good as they come, I would gladly drive an extra hundred miles to have Mailo look at my car the next time it needs work. I cannot say enough good things about Mailo's auto repair and his team. Thanks again Mailo!    - Ben Magnuson<//review>

Had a good experience with the staff here. They are friendly and very reasonable price. Needed a new engine and the price was amazing flat rate to put in my car no added fees. We are on a time crunch cause we are heading out of town and he said if he doesn’t have my car fixed by then he will give me a rental car for free so we don’t miss our trip. Definitely recommend< /Text>

Awesome people! They will not choke you out for your money- they charge you by the exact price and they're honest mechanics. It's a shame not every mechanic is honest about what's really wrong with the car. I'm so thankful the men who operate this place are unlike the corrupt society that unfortunately exists today. Would recommend to anyone :)< /text>

Incredibly amazing people. Very friendly and honest. It’s a very family oriented place, they greet you like a family member not just a customer. They offer low prices and will sometimes even go lower. They help you out to the fullest. Whatever you need, they’ll help. Need help with payments, or parts, or wanting to buy a car off of them, or whatever, they’ll help. They also sometimes offer food haha. They make sure everything is taken care of before you leave. They helped us out so much and we even bought a car off of them for a low price. Highly recommended 🏆<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>The best we have ever come across.  Honest, reliable.  Fast and dependable repairs.  Our truck broke down right off of the highway  6pm.
Called Mailo's and they took us in right away.  Needed a new water pump and thermostat.  One hour later we were ready to go.  No price gouging as usually happens in emergencies.  This is the place to go for any repairs.  Far better that over-priced auto repair chains.
Thank you once again.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c34c8f2f445ce5:0x1f987779fc06f2e7< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We took our car there and they completely messed things up way worse than when it was dropped off. Unwilling to fix it and ultimately i was forced to forfeit over 300 paid to him up front. That was my experience a little over a month ago.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1568837447802<//Date><Text>Worst experience I have ever had. If I could I would give this place no stars. I took my 1995 Toyota Tacoma there to have the fuel pump fixed and even after we told him we were sure it is the fuel pump he said he would run some tests first to be sure, which was fine at first, but it took him four (4) days for him to call me and tell me that he was sure the problem was definitely the fuel pump. Then it took him another day and half (1 1/2) to fix it. Once I finally got my truck back I realized the gas meter wasn't working anymore, it was showing empty even though the truck had half a tank before I took it to him. I went to fill the tank and it still showed empty. I told him about the gas meter showing empty and he told me he would need to order the sending unit because he noticed it was stuck at half tank when I took it to him. I explained that it wasn't stuck, I had filled the truck up not long ago and it was at half tank when I took it to his shop. He tried to brush it of and acted as if the sending unit did not work before I took it to him although it had been working fine and he told me he wouldn't be able to look at my truck to try to fix his mistake for another three (3) days. He charged me a total of three hundred and fifty dollars ($350) to change the fuel pump and he didn't even change the whole thing. Of course, I'm not sure where he ordered the part or how much the part vs the labor costed because they wouldn't give me a straight answer to my questions. His brother, Victor, would just tell me that Mailo is a very just and trustworthy person and that all the people in his neighborhood go to his shop and that he always provides good service for them. Victor also started talking about the rating he receives becuase all the people they know give them good reviews. Victor also tried to charge me an extra fifty dollars ($50) for an "official" receipt. He said it would be the taxes I would have to pay for the receipt, of course I'm not sure how true that is or how it actually works for the receipt, but that was my experience. Horrible, Mailo seemed nice, but the experience was the worst I've ever had.</Text>< Resp>

<Review>So thankful that Mailo was able to help me out when I was in dire need of it. The radiator on my 99 Blazer busted and it was near 5 pm on Saturday. I didn't have another car to go buy a radiator and install it myself, I needed my car the next day. After searching through Yelp for a local and reliable shop, Mailo's shop came up 1st. I gave Mailo's a call and despite being scheduled to close in less than 2 hours, I was told to bring my car in.

As soon as I arrived Mailo and his crew began working on my car. Minutes later Mailo was on his way to pick up a new radiator (with a lifetime warranty). At 6:15 pm I was driving out, what an incredible job. Almost every shop I searched for was closed at 5pm, and I am truly grateful that Mailo took the time to help me out. If I ever need anymore work done, this will be the only place I go to.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>Did my transmission and wheel barring and pluggs and gear cable. Did an excellent job and were completely honest and showed me the bad parts that were damaged. They didn't sit on the job but had my vehicle back to me in less than a week. I would recommend this mechanic shop to all of my family. 5- stars people.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>My mom had her car repaired here and he is very honest with you and will get you going. I brought my wife's car to him for an Air-Conditioning issue, another mechanic told me I would have to replace the whole AC-unit out. That will cost me over $10,000, he diagnosed the problem and advised me I only had to repair one of AC Lines. The repair work was less than $180 dollars, that was very reasonable for the work.
Like I said before he is an honest mechanic, he been in business for 32yrs and I know there are others who have been in business for more than that. But if you need a second opinion go to him, I'm glad I did.......<//review>< user>

Did a fabulous job replacing the water pump on our diesel truck prior to heading home to AZ.   The work was excellent and the crew here worked very quick to meet our needs.    Will definitely  use Milows again!< /text>

Mailo and his brother Victor are the best!! Late Saturday evening after they were closed, I called and Mailo was already at home but Victor was still at the shop. Mailo called him to let him know that I was on my way! Victor scanned my ABS system, showed me what it read, and cleared the codes for me!! He said they do not charge for scans, but after all of that I would not feel right not paying him something. 100% recommended great guys!!<//text>

Not good work, very rude and unprofessional. Also he overcharged me and he didn't even fix what he said he would. His son was also very rude to my girlfriend. He also had no urgency on fixing my car. Worst service ever.<//text>

Just started going to Harbor Point. We love it. Incredible teaching from the Pastors. Outstanding Worship music. We've been hunting for a new church since the back off of Covid. I think we found it. Thank you Lord for leading us to Harbor Point Church. May we follow you and your teachings Lord.< /Text>

< Review>
I've tried out a few different churches in the Orange County area since relocating and each one was special in their own way. For me Mariners South County left a lasting 1st impression because I was warmly welcomed by both the staff as well as the fellowship. The Pastor was funny and when the worship team took the stage I felt like I was at a concert! :)<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I was inspired to check out Mariners church after seeing how they helped my kids elementary school with donations of time and money as people at the church organized the community and church goers to give the school a facelift. I also saw Mariners extend open arms to all kids of people who were outcasts and fallen on hard times. As I researched the church I learned they had several campuses throughout Orange County.  I read some mixed reviews on google. I read a review from a local guide who apparently had never walked into the church itself. Inside the church I was greeted and offered help in finding where I was headed. The church has several ministries going that are extremely impactful to the community. I participated in a Mexico mission trip where the church has been serving for many years by helping children attend schools. I also observed a whole building at Mariners Irvine devoted to Student ministries for the upcoming youth. I also Noticed a whole Care and recovery building in Irvine open to anyone from any campus or any faith - devoted to multiple care and recovery platforms from Alcoholics Anonymous and Women's care and recovery ministries to Men battling sexual addiction. Never did I see a church or a set of people more interested in being in the community for the community than Mariners Church. Well done Mariners the work visible here is not of this world and that brings me to my last point. Humble leaders never pretending to be anything other than broken men and women seeking the Lord with all of their heart. I now call this church home and look forward to how the church and I will serve in the future.<//review>< Pics>

Attended for the first time 12.02.18 in the 11:30am service. The pastor named Jeff who spoke during this service chose to pander for laughs and likes from the congregation instead of presenting the Word of God with authority. Most of the service time consisted of him telling many silly personal stories with trivial details to appease the congregation instead of presenting the Word. Coddling the congregation and watering down God's Word is not the way to nurture the hungry souls of God's children. This service appeared to be more of a comedy hour to glorify pastor Jeff than a time to glorify and grow closer to Jesus. Jeff spent about 5 to 7 minutes at the end of the service actually speaking about some Biblcal information. Not once did he encouraged the congregation to bring a Bible or get a hold of a physical Bible if they did not own one. Phones, apps and slideshows are not an acceptable substitute to God's printed word. Pastoral service is not conforming to what we think that those congregated would like to hear, but speaking the truth without fear of what others might think. Being a pastor is not a role to which we are to seek to glorify ourselves like a Pharisee, it's about Jesus and what He's done for us. It's hard to understand that in a culture of self-absorbency like the one in Orange County. We don't come to a church to hear the pastor, we come to hear what GOD has to say to us. May you have eyes to see and ears to hear.

Some of the other reviews mention the ambiance and snacks. These are mere bread and circus my friends. The truth is if the staff, who are very much held accountable for every word that comes out of their mouths, are not feeding you God's unadulterated TRUTH they are not obeying God and are doing you zero good. It's easy to appease people with food, drink & comedy. Obeying God and delivering His Word is more challenging and the real point of gathering. A superficial and worldly church will comfort your body, a living church will cultivate your soul. Jeff and other pastoral staff: Will you be able to look back and testify before Father God that you did EVERYTHING He directed you to do in order to reach His children?

Being aware of the symbolism presented on your building or stage or property is important. Your decorations on stage were satanic pyramids with the all seeing eye.</text>

Love this place. Has 2 different childs parks and tons of walking and picnic space. Did i mention the train rides for families around the park? And it has public restrooms. Is handicapped accessible. For everyone to enjoy. Thumbs up if you agree.<//Review>

<Review>My favorite place for a daily walk or bike ride! Always plenty of fresh air, empty benches and picnic tables, and so much nature to enjoy. My favorite is listening to and watching the various water fowl!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkR1Ryun53AxkGPcrW_WUYQ_u16KtaNichW48f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKEPOL9LCcNKXP1Ryqp6KzhNIhzgU8npxPyB4g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPThbYFN0ZN87AsPfwLjSrAVU71u2344sgZnozh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIXbsHOWTndjAhTDME1uKef_plSM0gyIHgEAj4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBWbVYa3-_TgedZuuGt0zP1J-P6YeUA0O-rtPt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPABR5WCovJIDIpRN6qnDHIsky6rmOexfthKCQ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQHWI9H-zV2TJE432F4mElqomANp35A6vWVIUi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_0JJPX3iaoOq-hpXhOHm4NBCl9kEU1Ye22FYf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd94mhb5JEJ_zz6xhWNtRQ7rEHDVxaN1qcOoci=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPusu5JmlqiVNIWgFezaRDBeEat2bwZ_lScfp3u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

I’ve been here couple of times, but this my first time back on thanksgiving/ 2020.
No parking fee, no entrance fee,
It has a lot of picnic tables, BBQ area, clean bathrooms, staff working here very friendly, and the most perfect place to capture the fall colors, since the air was calm and the sun was out.
It was a little bit crowded, but everybody was wearing masks and they were good with building a distance.
This park provides a lot of different activities ... such as running,hiking, fishing, walking, bicycling, and of course be modeling.
If I stayed a little later, I will be able to enjoy the beautiful fantasy of Christmas lights.< /review>

This park is so family friendly, it has several benches for picnics. Boat paddling, kayak boats, etc you could rent for 1 hr. The boat paddling is $25 an hour but I would advise to reserve your boat on their website especially if you are trying to go on a weekend!!! Anyways there is also a little train and many ducks walking around the park... overall great place</text>

Today was a beautiful day out at Vasona Park. Not many people and everyone was being respectable wearing masks. There were some people out walking their dogs. I even saw a cat on a leash. We found a nice area under the shade with a view of the lake and greenery of the grass and trees. Its a nice place to go on long walks and just enjoy the weather.</text>

<user>110130399990389359450<//user><text>This is actually a great park! The similar park to this one is Lake Elizabeth in Fremont which also offers Kayak/Boating in the Lake. Vasona Lake has smaller in size but offers much easier parking. Also the trails are better and easier to access. For South Bay guys, I will prefer Vasona Lake as it is closer to me...</text>< GmapID>

<user>117242198695640262642<//user><text>Santa Clara County parks are overrated. The walking paths are paved, crowded and shared with rambunctious bicyclists.
This would all be acceptable if it wouldn't cost six bucks and would serve only the immediate neighborhood.  But for some reason people flick here from all over the county.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>It’s a great park. My comment is regarding the parking- there was a super long line at the entrance which could be avoided. If the cashier at the entry would prepare the change for and the Reciepts ahead of time it would be x4 faster. I’ve seen it done in most parks<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Recently visit to Vasona Lake County Park. Awesome fall view. Less crowded. A well spent time. No tickets. Can easily get parking. Face mask is must. If you want to see lightning pay $20(visit their site for more details) which happens in the evening< /Review><gmap_id>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24< /gmap_id><resp>None</resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

Too hot to take the boats in the summer. No shadow in the lake. The safe vest makes you even hotter. I do not recommend to go boarding in the summer. Other than that, the lake has beautiful view and lots of parking space, lots of tables for family picnic.< /review>

A lovely park with a lake to walk around. You can’t do the full loop, however as there’s a dam at the other end. During the winter months there is a Festival of Lights driving light show which is very popular. Parking is also currently free because of Covid-19. Usually there is a fee to park. There is also a small playground for kids. There are a lot of different parking lots as well. Parking near the entrance means a little bit of a walk, but you’re more likely to get a spot.<//review>

Nice place for an afternoon walk. Kayak, canoe and peddle boat are also available. There's also a small train running inside the park</Review>

The best place to spend family time with boating around the lake. Kids will enjoy the most. Even family can relax for a day under the green trees without any disturbances.</Review>

<review>Beautiful park.
We spent one whole day and returned home relaxed and rejuvenated. Beautiful lake with boats and ducks.
One side of the park has bbq and the bad smell/smoke travels far, so choose your place before setting up.< /review>< pics>

<review>Best for one day trip. It's 1hour drive from Oakland. Easy to reach. Several parking lots are available. Picnic tables make our meal time easier.  Park your vehicle based on the location. Lake side pretty crowded. So choose week days. You can walk around the lake. Boating is possible. Good to go with bike. You can see different birds and squirrels. It has washroom in different area of the picnic area.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

A lovely walk with the family.  Love that it connects with LG Creek and the trail.  Only wish you could walk fully around the lake.  Boating here too.  Also connects with Oak Meadow park with the carousel and steam train rides.  Popular but not overly crowded.< /review>

Great place for picnics.  I go on the Los Gatos Creek Trail to bike and always find myself stopping to appreciate the beauty of this park.  Park benches right by the water makes it an ideal place to just sit and admire the scenery.< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>It is well maintained with lots of play structures. It gets crowded quickly because the overall space is small but I think this is one of the well optimized playgrounds I have seen. Kids can keep themselves entertained for couple of hours. The lake is just a minute or two walk and the losgatos creek trail. The sight of the train is fun to watch. Parking at the oak meadow park is better and it's only a five minute walk down to vasona park along the trail. That way kids get a lot of variety.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate><user>113423539172951208904<//user><username>Arun Kalyanasundaram<//username>< Gmap_id>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Vasona park has natural beauty with lots of tree and greenery. It has a small lake with more than 20 ducks which roam everywhere in the park. The ducks get attracted to you if you give them food or if you carry anything. Trails are best for walking and cycling both. Children's and adults both can cycle and it's fun. The best weather to visit would be with one day when the day is less sunny. Also, there are no entrance fees right now, but remember to maintain social distancing.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great place for strolling and relax.
The park is huge, there's a big lake, green grass plot. Almost all people wear masks.
That park will be great for everyone.
The park allows to bring a dog with you.<//review>< Pictures>

This park has stunning views it is one of my favorite places to witness a sunset at. One small issue is a decent accumulation of waste which includes plastics and styrofoam behind the plants near to the concrete. Overall this is a great place to spend time at.<//Text>

This is a great place to enjoy outdoors, take the kids to have some fun or walk your dog. Also, if you feel like exercising outdoors they have a long jogging track and some workout apparatus. Public restrooms and fresh water also available. The cool thing about this place is the Fantasy of Lights Drive-Thru. Every Christmas season you can drive through an amazing Christmas light show. Kids (and adults) have a lot of fun with it.<//review>

Very nice park for kids and adults. I would give it a five star but it took 45 minutes just to wait in line to oay and park.< /Review>

<Text>This is a great place to exercise, go for a leisurely stroll, or picnic. Beautiful setting against Vasona Lake, generally small boat activity during the summer, and a drive through Christmas light extravaganza in the winter. Connects to Los Gatos Creek trail so extending outside the park for extra adventure is easy.</Text>< pictures>

Beautiful place with a lake view. You can go for a walk, run, etc. The place is huge so at times it's not overcrowded like other parks around.< /Review>

Certainly one of my fave parks in the Bay Area, chill, great family crowd. Fair balance of wild-life and family activities.

Great place for Christmas lights and the train (when it is back)

Highly recommend for families.< /Text>

Vasona Lake is a fabulous place to go and walk even in the time of covid.  Geese, heron, great paths along the bank and into Oak Meadow Park.  Some playgrounds sprinkled around.  Picnic spots with bbqs.< /Text>

It's a really nice little park.  There's plenty of grass for picnicking and playing sports, as well as trees for shade.  Various parts of the park have different amenities, such as tables and playgrounds, and there are footpaths connecting all of it.  And of course, there's a really pleasant lake with boat (paddle and kayak) and paddle board rentals!  Wonderful place for a half-day picnic or just for a nice walk.</review>< Rate>

Nice park. A little too congested for me to want to go on a regular basis. Proper bathroom facilities, small boating, ducks, geese, small train, bridge, fishing allowed. Concession, train and boat rentals look to only be open on weekends. This park is good for cycling. Good for walking and running. Very safe. Free parking.< /Review>

It does cost $ to get in and park, but there is another park next door that sometimes doesn't require pays to play and you can walk over the bridge in Vasona. There is a cool playground there too. The miniature railroad is super cool to even just watch. And you can walk along or meet it at different parts of the track. Good place to make great memories!</Review><username>James Russell</username><date>1562677501204</date></record>

Beautiful park with pedestrian and bike trails along water features such as lakes and creeks. There is a small train, carousel, public restrooms as well as large grass areas and gathering spaces for events.<//text>

😷 Wear a mask, nice park for a winter walk. Clean well maintained trails and for today parking inside the park was free. At 11:30 am on Monday the trails were empty.  Lots of public entry points. One near Ohlone Ct. Dog friendly but must be on leash.< /review>

What a great experience my family had. We picked a perfect time, it was a Christmas display via our own car. We also went to San Jose's " Christmas in the park" It was close, so close we gave it a tie. How could anyone pick a winner?
Thanks to all the workers (Especially ANDY)< /text>

Lovely early fall afternoon pedalboating on Lake Vasona. Only one more week left before the boat center closes for this season. So peaceful. Looking forward to the Festival of Lights<//Review>

<text>Amazing park to bring kids for a day of fun. There's plenty of open space to leave your kids at their will to enjoy. So many play areas to engage the kids. Lots of picnic tables to be used for gatherings. Covered ones to be reserved through online portal. The train and carousel are amazing too, though they mostly run on the weekends. There was a community activity going on in the grounds the day we visited keeping it busy.
Overall, its an amazing place to go and relax especially during the summer.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc9TA2g9JjSUnPHYZrzpIOfrv8mjy4DhBLMFd_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrlxe651dATMGKpBlKL5YstJtplun6ojJQFEcn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkk6ULgq0n3Det7lbZ9_m476B13Y0L8QCvb2Xg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjqMVaFQUGiNYwZw8IZu5AAe5uSU1eKH0jUIWU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPExLexp5wpmb1FsLOLbirC0eZoKtniMBQ1qjj2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObpUE4b4-tJapkKj4WI08dwOCLKCODZdEw8YGL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlOid2n-H4IcFZmBjXQJOq27SSUwzOvsMJhBUR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjLbGHo0K6vY3AsqpjFEVS5YJsg7w8g-JX1w25=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODYk4bz7EzkHFbC4YerlTdGsxOblmew4KfY5FL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWIq0egkR0dmXb1tg44NDDsoBjfarFmH36LSnZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCvwZqqUuQ7ZMGYNnvv4kztynFxg1uyzY3us-x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFOYkLf37W-FhzmL0Pzifll5xZ9ODmirRF8GZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnShSlTBpw47HolpgM7M3YicmJ1MpewnfSwz5n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN0w2Wa2Va8ZPQieAbshJ9_-jJk6DagPhUGtw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwbm_GcWQl4O877JK27dEPQzg2IywxWqwHTuv4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMOBM_4bp1U7OuBOk8R7HkuYLCLUg23sGzcEZF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9CDEeKmhCb6kO_lw0hqxvDC8bHPuibxBr5XV0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Love love love everything about Vasona.  There's something to like for everybody from walking, hiking, biking, roller blading, canoing, kayaking, paddle boating, pic nics, parties, games, concerts, there is litterally something for everyone.  Come pic nic with view of the lake, relax on the lawn, have bbq's with family and friends.  BBQ areas, bathrooms, parking, paved walking trails, fishing, water sports (non motorized) including the sister park Oak Meadow park next door.  You'll find Billy Jones Railroad, a Carousel, baseball field, horseshoes, pic nic tables with private dining areas you can reserve and so many fun things to do.< /Review>

One of the best places for picnics, boating, birthday parties, bbq, biking, etc. Lots of ducks and goose to admire. Their Christmas lights that start from end of November look beautiful!
Closes at sunset so be careful of that! (We got stuck inside and a park ranger had to drive us out. :p )
Cabs can't come in to pick you at an inside parking if the park is closed because they close the gates.</review>< Pics>

My bf and I were out for an errand run and I told him that I needed fresh air. He went out of his way to drive to this park and my first impression as a non-California resident I was impressed by the scenery and space.

There was a lot of people (Saturday afternoon) by the water and the main park entrance... I did like how there wasn't as much at the very back end of the park. I also noticed a lot of people/families not wearing their masks even like passing by othe people. That was the only thing that was sketchy.

Other than that, I want to come back and do a picnic maybe earlier in the day when there is less people.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><review>I only went to the park during the lockdowns.  It offers a playground for children, good open area for activities.  Also offers picnic area with BBQ.  You can go to the lake and take a walk along it.  The Los Gatos Creek trail cuts through the park, you might have a few fast cyclist once in a while.  I could imagine parking being a pain if there is no covid</review>< pictures>

In case you are wondering if the park is still open like what I did, it is still open! Google maps is incorrect. The park is still open and still beautiful. The entrance fee is also waived at this time. But it can be a bit crowded at some places in the park. Be careful to maintain social distance. It’s serious!<//review>

<text>Really Beautiful place to hangout with friends, kids or partner. They have a lake, biking trail, easy to medium hikes. You can easily spend couple of hours in the park.

Good place for relaxing. Working, running, barbecue, playing with children. There are several parking lots. You need to confirm with your friends which one you will meet there.< /text>

There is a nice path around the Lake, plenty of open grass areas and places to barbeque.  You can even fish for bass, granted they aren't that big but it's perfect to take your little one just to have throwing in a line.  Can rent the foot petal boats and cruise around the lake and have a good time.< /Text>

<text>Nice for families with small kids. Flat, paved walkways and a large playground. Holiday lights in December. You have to pay for parking inside the park but just outside there is usually plenty of street parking. Can be very busy, not a great place if you are looking for a quiet spot.< /text>< user>

<review>This is a great place to take your kids to show Christmas lights. Be prepared to be in the queue for anywhere between 30 mins to one hour before you enter into the park. The pictures doesn’t do justice, it’s better in person. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!</review><user_id>108620748962503270300<//user_id>< gmapID>

<Review>Even with the Cove in crisis going on, people are wearing Matt and social distancing while at the park. We went to a wonderful picnic table in the shade and had a snack. The park was full of Canadian geese and a colony of squirrels right in front of us at the top of the bushes on Constant Guard and loving are carrots. Everybody was very respectful and the park was so clean! I was very impressed how everyone pitches in to help make the park a fun place to go. They also rent out sail boats, kayaks, and paddle boats!!! When there is no there AR wonderful playgrounds for the children and a train that runs the length of the Park 4 the children to see.< /Review>< pictures>

I wouldn't recommend coming here on weekends because it gets pretty busy, but it's a beautiful place to walk, jog, bike, or skate.<//Review>

Such a beautiful spot! I bring my dog here to work on her dog-reactivity - it has wide trails and large open spaces so she can get enough distance from other dogs. There’s also water fountains throughout with dog dishes, which is a nice convenience.<//Review>

A perfect location to enjoy so many things.
Nice grill near the lake shore with benches to increase the comfort.
Almost well mananged park with greenery and enough stops for parking.
Grill needs to be cleaned before cooking anything but that is the case for all parks that provide grills.< /Review>< Pics>

Lake has boating facilities. Seen guy fishing in Lake.

Park has lot of trails and biking path. Park has toy train ride fun for kids.

A nice park for picnicking with plenty of open space.  Meandering trails for walking, running, or biking.  This time came in through the Los Gatos Creek Trail, from San Jose through Campbell, then arriving at the park.  A relaxing place.< /Review>

This park may just be one of the best parks this side of the Mississippi. There is beauty to be found throughout it's vast landscape, from it's picturesque lake to the bounds of grassy fields. This place is perfect for a barbeque with family, a walk with your dog, or even a friendly soccer game. I love this park and I know you will love it too.</Text>

Love this park. My kids even more. It is a very nice clean park and i pretty much there every weekend. It has a nice train ride and carousel. Adults can ride in the train as well. Kids love the park and rides. Also they have onsite bbq hot dogs and I believe burgers. I have never tried them but other seems to enjoy it. Also they have drinks, pop corn and ice creams available as well. It has a nice park with slides, swings, model fire truck and a model jet where kids can climb up have fun. there are lot running tracks, i have seen folks with their bikes there, picnics and birthday parties. I highly recommend this place if you want to have a good time with family.Parking is $6, train and carousel rides are $3 per person. childer under 2 yrs old are free for train and carousel ride.< /Text>

Nice park with ample parking. Covid restrictions have closed the playground. The boat rental is have open but you need to book in advance.

Important note, you cannot bring your own stand up stand up paddle board. You can only use the ones for rent<//text>

<Review>I love how peaceful it is to walk around this park. You’re very much in tune with nature. My wife and I come here a lot to walk around, read a book by the lake, and there’s even a biking trail. People come here to fish, paddle on the lake, and see the ducks and geese flock together. The park is well-maintained.</Review>< Name>

What a great park, the bike paths are awesome and free if you enter on a bike. To drive in, the day fee was $6 (2018). We came to ride our onewheel and will be back soon as the paths are long and smooth and picturesque.
Whatever reason brings you here it's a great destination and a beautiful space to be enjoyed by all!</Review>

<Review>Love this place. The views are beautiful the trails well marked and the people are usually very nice. Yesterday, when I was walking with my mom we stopped to tell the Ranger that we saw some teenagers tearing down the netting around the playground area. The Ranger was super friendly and kind. I didnt get his name but was very impressed with him! Toward the end of our walk we witnessed a man on bike almost running into a little girl on her bike. The man was extremely rude and began cussing causing the little girl to cry. My mom and I stopped to talk to the little girl and her family. They were very nice and with some kind words we were able to get the girl to stop crying. When biking in a crowded public place remember to reduce speed ( if needed) and be kind. Overall still love Vasona!!!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Lovely place. Plenty of parking. The fee isnt that high. I believe it was $5. Very popular walking trail. The lake has wildlife and a fair amount of people having birthday parties, fishing, eating, and riding boats. Cant go wrong with coming here.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfjbUapnjPmWCd5Q2A2SUt7fWz6EhRVstDo1n8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><user>104652373862066195563<//user><time>1557302615764</time></record>

<review>Excellent facilities for toddlers, great for amateur kites when there's a breeze, you can usually find ducks in the river and geese in the field. sometimes they're even concerts at that little pavilion we really love coming here on the weekend.</review>< pics>

Beautiful park which is well maintained to be fresh and green even in peak summer. You can find a lot of activities like kayaking, cycling, boating, party areas, trails etc</Text>

<text>Things have gotten lot better since my previous review. Boating has resumed, lot more folks use the park and lake. It is a great place for family picnic, even during Covid-19 pandemic. I see people social distancing, wearing mask and enjoying the nature.

My Previous Review
This used be very nice park. My recent visit revealed, things have really changed. Looks like a park in third world country now. Looks like there is no boating in the lake. Construction going on several places. Grass is not maintained. Looks like a disaster. Hope city takes some action and brings it back to its original state. There is still annual fantasy lights during christmas. This is a great place for photo shoot, BBQ and picnic.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9G6onxVOPldPpzg1AhnQNMS86zCNAez36vL6c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnkjWXhJQKagHbLWjrk1Y9dsi-KCcEqKGK8kB-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMleMbB5r1Kg3PkJOEjn3zKNo736pPqoe4wwl5T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmaqROxxIdUGyNaOAzckVJZSSBzDOhj9RQvDMI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt80KEd1Y1U1t3xb799NXGg_7zX_SXNLN-4TmH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-qEggqFwV_NBHQUN27RxsFCiJc0P-PhojKGdJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< rate>

<review>Wonderful local park. Picnicing, canoeing, walking and bicycle-riding, all within the park. They've recently renovated the bumpy bike trail on the east side of the lake, and it is smoother and wider than before -- so nice. On weekends, the Wildcat steam locomotive might be running, providing a bit of nostalgia, as well as a quick train ride for the under-5 set (and their parents).<//review></record></dataset><record>

My granddaughter wanted to go fishing
I decided to go to Vasona Lake Park. It was lovely day, when we arrive I asked the ranger for a suggestion and gave me directions. We fished from the pier for awhile, but my granddaughter wanted to move to the shoreline, we found a shady spot close by. We did not catch any fish, but had nice lunch saw a big turtle, geese, ducks and various birds. We had a nice time.< /Review>

One of the coolest place to visit with family or friends for Sunday evening picnic, outing or just biking. Unfortunately, I went there alone for the purpose of a hike but there aren't a lot of hiking trails here (at least none that I could find). Otherwise great place. Also don't forget to bring a jacket as it gets quite windy in the evenings.</Text>

This park used to be the Jewel of the area. Now, it is in a sad state of neglect. The grass has died and weeds are taking over. The ground is not absorbing the water, so, there is standing water near the play ground. (Breeding ground for mosquitoes, this time of year) The geese have taken over in many areas and their droppings are all over the playground; in the sand and walkways, too. To top it off, there is no shade in many areas of the park, and the surrounding areas; where is the heat prevention? (Need more over hangs, where the benches are, and the seated kid rides; the metal is hot!. Water fountains, for cooling stations. Etc) I loved coming to this park as a kid and young adult; now though, I was embarrassed to have brought my friend and his 3 year old. The poor guy was overheating and couldn't ride the swings, or the metal turtle/duck, because they were hot to the touch.
Maybe partner with Netflix, or surrounding companies, to get some volunteers to help out the staff, to return the park to it's once beautiful state?</Review>

Sprawling, picturesque park with great access to the LG Creek Trail which runs through most of the eastern side. Be mindful of the shared use trail and leave some space for bikes to pass.</review>

Its a huge park with tons of picnic areas and a nice lake. There is enough parking across the park which is convenient.

It is very crowded on the day we went their and most people were not wearing masks or following social distancing so that was a bummer but not a fault of the park< /Review>

Nice area to relax, have bbq's and walk around. Some people were fishing, hiking, and biking on certain paths. You do have to pay to get in and park for the day. But beautiful area.</Review>

Very nice park. I went there with my small dog and we enjoyed the sounds of the birds and the water. It is great for running and biking and I even saw that you can rent kayaks for the water. I came a bit earlier than 8am and it seemed closed. I was confused if I am supposed to pay or not if there are no attendants. Either way, there was plenty of parking since it was early. I ran into a couple of people who were running and walking dogs. It would be nice to have a picnic here!< /review>

<text>Nice lake to take the children to play. Plenty of room off the path to play games and the overall view of the park is very nice. This is one of those parks where you rarely see any bad elements hanging out and up to no good like you would in other areas.<//text>< Pictures>

One of the best trail run places in silicon valley, miles and miles, with marks on the ground.  Beautiful scenery around, peaceful as well. Lots of running groups on weekend mornings. Enough parking spaces along the trails.</Text>

We visited this place for the "Fantasy Of Lights" . The folks light up the whole park with some beautiful lights and it's a drive intour only during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am sure this is one of the best holiday lighting in bay area. Children love this place. However, one has to book tickets in advance.< /Review>

Great park but on the trails people are not taking social seriously. If you hang out on the grass you'll be fine.95% stay off the grass.

Oh do Not fly your airplane or drone. It is not allowed, park rules. I flew my drone 2 days in a row. Second day a ranger sped over in her truck and yelled on her truck speaker "Hey you put that away in your vehicle NOW...."!

Not a great experience I had no clue there are no signs to let you know its not allowed. I did find the park rules on their Vasona's website.

I understand everyone including the rangers are frustrated with the virus.

She could have handled me with some politeness. Other people were very upset the way she yelled at me. I'm 47 yrs old and I was with my children and spouse. Although I was playing with my drone. I'm far from being a child. Kindness goes a very long way especially during all our frustrations.

My family continue to enjoy the park its well manicured and the restrooms are well cleaned.

Thanks Vansona Park Team 👍< /Text>

<text>Great park for the family and kids. They have the train running on weekends so the kids will LOVE the train and merry-go-round on a nice sunny day. Especially Thanksgiving weekend, there are so many families and kids having a blast.
CAREFUL of the goose poop, it is quite large and everywhere in the grass.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Still a nice place to go for a walk, and the playground is still open, but large areas of the park are closed off for repairs, meaning much of the park, including restrooms, are inaccessible. Orange net fencing everywhere. There are 2 portapotties at the top of the hill next to YSI, which at least appear to be serviced every 3 days, with a place to wash your hands available.

⚠️ A word of caution: I was somewhat surprised to encounter a coyote running around in broad daylight near the Youth Sciences Institute. It was not afraid of me either! Dog-walkers: please be careful and keep your dogs on leash, especially small dogs.<//Text>

A play area, lots of open green space and picnic tables with BBQ areas for groups/ families, trails for walkers/ bikers and water too! Boating is seasonal. There's an ice cream truck that has a good selection, accepts cash and Venmo.
Plenty of parking lots in different areas of the park. All these make it worth the $6 fee.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Vasona Lake County Park is extra nice because it isn’t just another square field in the middle of downtown. VLCP has a lake, a railway, swans, wandering paths, trees, green, green and more green!

<Text>Vasona park and lake is one of the best managed public spaces in the bay. Besides the many trails that intersect and connect Vasona lake to bay area bike and pedestrian trails they offer boating, bodyboards,  paddle and sail boats. There are many spaces all with full bbq facilities, playgrounds, bridge, hiking ,fishing and summer  concerts. There is even an ice cream truck on the weekends. The far end of the park has a real scaled down train for people to ride. You cant swim in the lake but with the many water activities there are plenty of fun options. The cost is reasonable per hour for rentals or just relax on a grassy hill. Vasona park is free to walk in. Parking on weekends can be difficult so get there early. The restrooms are clean and well equipt.  Spaces for BBQ need to be reserved in advance on busy days. As well you are only blocks from historic downtown Los Gatos if you crave some great restaurants. Make a weekend of it at Vasona Park! I highly recommend.<//Text></record>

Good place and environment is good for walking
People are maintaining social distances so kind off safe
It should be little more clean for better environment</text>

<Text>This park has it all. It’s got playgrounds, a lake that you can rent a pedal boat during the Summer, they have a small railroad, fields, and walking trails galore! In the Winter, they set up lights all over the Park that you can purchase tickets for and drive through while listening to Holiday music. This is the perfect place to bring your family to, or if you want to take a scenic run through.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1596153934758<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Need to get out? Covid Quarantine Depression getting you down? I found the perfect place for you to escape to and odds are, if you're looking at this, it's in your own backyard.

Spacious and green fields, plenty of room to social distance from others. Water sports available ($18 for single or a paddle board, $23 an hour for the peddle boats) on the quaint, calm, blue lake. Honestly, it is beautiful! Plenty of trails to walk, bike, hike, etc around the lake as well.

There's a fair number of geese that will honk for food if you are having a picnic and they leave landmines here and there but hey, they're still avoidable and lay down a blanket on the grass and you're fine!

While there are tables still available, for single household usage, the group areas are off limits at this time. Masks are encouraged but again there is so much space that you could isolate yourself somewhere and take yours off for a bit if you need the freedom of being maskless outdoors.

Another "perk" during COVID is parking was free. Not sure if that's for always but it was today! That was really nice. With plenty of good restaurants doing takeout in nearby Los Gatos or Campbell, like Thai Spice or Back A Yard or, if you want to get fancy The Bywater (which you can then eat by the water... At the lake... In the park), it's easier than ever to enjoy a quick picnic in a scenic locale away from your home for a bit and off screens for once.

Enjoy!</Text>< Pictures>

Best park around in my opinion. Tons of wildlife, a merry-go-round, working mini train and great picnic locations for groups. It's a huge property too with great trails. I grew up visiting this park and I still love going as an adult. Try it especially if you have energetic kids that need space and activities to wear them out.<//Text>

What an amazing place. Great for family gatherings, picnics or a stroll on a nice day. Love coming here to walk the parks when the weather is nice. For those with children, they have a merry-go-round and train that rides around the park. People, please pick up after your pets!<//Review>

You can take the trails along Los gatos creek from Meridian Avenue to Lexington reservoir and uphill to the top of mountain for a great view of the valley< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Need to unwind? Or have a family picnic. There is something for all to do in this huge lake park it's a picturesque place with lots to explore. If you like cycling your in for a treat. The Los Gatos Creek trail is really a must over 20 miles of trails from meridian ave entrance or any of the many trail entrances will put you on the path bring plenty of water and some snacks and your best girl/guy and you can't be disappointed. Even if you don't bring a lunch there are many choices along the way for food/drink. But hold out until you get to Los Gatos downy town offers all you'll need. Enjoy this wonderful park for all ages. And please bring out what you bring in<//Text>< user_id>

We absolutely love this park! We got the annual pass even though we are going to be here for three months because we come here all the time. The park is getting ready for their winter light show and it looks like there will be a ton of lights. Kids will ride the train and look at the lights. Soooooo cool.</Review>

Very peaceful place for a walk. Please note that you cannot cross the dam. Stay on the right of the lake as you head to the dam for a longer walk. At Christmas there is a son et
Lumiere around the driveway, quite entertaining after dusk.< /text>

This park is a great place to go and walk around. The scenery is great, lots of field, kid friendly, and theres even a train that goes around the park. Great place to do photography or a photo shoot.< /Review>

They have nicely spread out picnic tables with grills, paddle boats, kayaks, and rowboats for rent during summer, and a miniature steam engine that takes trips around a section of the park. The best thing about Vasona is it’s layout. No matter how busy the park, you can almost always find a comfortable section for yourself. If you like jogging, the park connects to the Los Gatos Creek trail near the dam.< /text><username>Becca Lim< /username></record></dataset><record>

Stopped for a rest here, and used the bathrooms which were exceptionally clean and well-maintained. Lots of little birds, and families enjoying them.</review>

The park is large with a long road. There is a lake with a pier and it Is beautiful and calming to see. You can rent paddle boats and kayaks. Great place to walk or bike. There is a train and carousel also. You have to pay for parking but it is worth it.<//Review>

<review>It's an awesome place to have picnic style children's birthdays. It's equally great to take a book and chill out on the lawn. They have fishing by the pier and options to go boating, neither of which I have tried yet but look like they might be great fun! Picnic tables, shade, sun, children's park, place to walk - they've provided for everything!</review>< pics>

<text>It's a big, vast park with a beautiful, serene lake! And all you have to pay is for the parking space of $6. You can occupy 3 tables for free for the whole day! We had such a good time there, one unforgettable, enjoyable outing experience! Kudos to the management!😊<//text>< Response>

<Review>Excellent for runs or walks. You can get up to 8.5 miles each way, so great if you are training for a marathon or half. Biking, for adults it would be boring. Too many people on the trails and you will go very slow besides it is mostly flat - kids on  the hand would have a blast on their bikes. The trails go along several water patches and of course Vasona lake. Makes for a pleasant run/walk/time.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The train and carousel are amazing too - though, they mostly run on the weekends.

This park has everything you need! Lake, BBQ stations, peddle boat, Kayak,  train, carousel, playground, and restrooms. Through the main entrance, you will pay $6 for parking. If you have a disabe plate, parking is free. The road split off to different sections with plenty of tables.  Some BBQ pit and tables are reserved so be on the lookout for that.  Train ride is about 10 minutes around the main area with $3 per adult. Children under 3 is free. On summer and weather permits, they sell hot dogs and burgers by the railroad station. On weekends, the park fills up quickly so arrive early if you want a picnic table with lake view.<//review>

It's a beautiful park to spend time with family on a nice sunny day. Beautiful lake, a park, bridge, play area all these together make it a wonderful spot to take some snaps too.
It gets really rush on a sunny day and entrance kid of takes time. Too many cars waiting in que to enter and only one person to let them all in. This takes really lot of time. Hope they change that.</review>

Calm and beautiful. I used to go there to accompany kids, they loved the steam train. Now I go for usual hikes, from the lake to the beautiful downtown Los Gatos.  Lots of bathrooms and shaded areas. You can BBQ too if you wish or make a simple picnic. Worth the visit everyday!< /text>

An amazing  park. Very big nice open fields. Lots of play areas for the kids. I live how they have a small train that takes you around the park... parking is not free and it does get a little hard to find a spot during the holidays.. but every other day, an amazing  place to go!!</Text>

Went on a great bike ride through Wassona park it's always nice to see. You can't go in the water but you can go on the carousel on the train ride and you could have a picnic here if you reserve a spot for a large group but you can also just sit out at many of the picnic benches or on the grass,  lots of places for the kids to run around and play.  Pets must be on the leash.< /Text>

Absolutely beautiful park having lots of areas to picnic with family and groups. There's a trail one can ride bikes on or simply walk, a playground for kids to enjoy, and lots more!< /text>

This park is awesome! Great for jogging, riding bikes, paddle boats, fishing, but not so great for riding skate boards.  Unless of course you have bigger wheels. I found out the hard way and have a new battle scar to show off. Other than that, it's really nice.</text>

I love Vasona park with it's spacious greenery, and calming creek. My dog especially loved walking around the park visiting with the kids and adults. It was a great outing at Vasona park.< /Text>

The park is usually very clean. The walking trail is busy. If you are biking be prepared for the walkers to invade the entire path, I hope your bike has a bell. With all that said, it's a beautiful walk or ride.<//Text>

We went here to see the Christmas and New Year lights. The visit was well organized. Just remember to pre-book your visit beforehand as the visits are sold out well in advance.

This year they had many Dinosaurs, Santas, Elves, Reindeers among others displays. It took us a good 30 minutes to get inside the park.< /Text>

One of the best parks in the Bay area. Wonderful running/biking trail along the lake that goes past children's playgrounds, picnic areas, the rail road all the way to downtown Los Gatos. Great live music during the summer and has several access points which allow you to park for free.< /Review>

Run, take a boat on the lake, picnic, bring the dog, see the streams, ride Billy Jones wildcat Railroad, or the carousel, lay on the grass, or bird watch.  If you can't find something you like...it is your fault.  Enjoy this gem of a county Park for everyone.< /Review>< Pics>

Saw 2018 Festival of Lights.  It was amazing but the line took a solid hour.  We arrived at the gate 45m past our designated start time but they let us in no questions.  The drive through also lasted about an hour driving slow and was well worth it!<//Review>

<Review>Open grassy fields with good supply of picnic tables. Favored by families with young children as they also offer a small train ride plus merry-go-round. We came here by hiking at nearby trails, which I'd highly recommend. Connects up with San Jose to the north, Los Gatos and down to the reservoir to the south. Excellent trails. This park offers the restroom facilities useful on the hike.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I go running through this park multiple times a week, alone or with my dog. It's well maintained. There are plentiful areas to stop and enjoy the park's wildlife, trees, and lake views.</Review>

I love this park. It's a gem of nature tucked away in the city. Tons of green space, walking and biking trails all surrounding a beautiful lake. I come here weekly with my 2 year old and dog. They have two very nice children's play areas, the park is clean and well kept and it's such a large area you really feel like you're escaping the city. They do charge $6 for parking but it is so worth it. One of the best parks I've been to in the bay area.< /review>

<Text>Very disappointment this year for the Fantasy of Lights WALK THRU. It has become a tradition to attend this event and I have done the drive thru in the past. We arrived at the NETFLIX parking garage were the event was offering free parking/shuttle transportation to the park entrance.  Went to the check in table to find they were not allowing people to enter, at this time it was 8:25PM (the ranger even checked her phone). She had said there was a shuttle schedule on the website. I checked the website and Eventbrite where we preordered the tickets. If there is a shuttle schedule it is not easily accessible AND if there is a last call time it should have been indicated. The only reference to time the directions had was event from 4:00-9:00PM. We arrived at 8:25PM!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Absolutely beautiful, it's a big wide open Park with many BBQ Pits and a whole range of space to have absolutely fun for family. They have beautiful bike trails and beautiful trails to run of course.

I will absolutely will come back to this park yet again!</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Love this park and it's been a go-to for a number of years. There is enough to do for the whole family - from the train ride and carousel for kids to boating in the lake or just a nice stroll in the wooded area. A small stream flows through the park that makes for good picnic spots near the water and there are a ton more options with bbq areas and tables etc. Parking on the street can be tricky but for a day long visit the paid parking is very convenient.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I haven’t been in three years, i didn’t realize they don’t sell tickets in person... it was a little awkward to have to exit the park and pull over on the road and purchase our tickets on my phone... but it was worth it. The lights had doubled since I had been last and my daughter really enjoyed it. It made our holiday season for sure! Nothing like staying toasty in my car and seeing millions of lights 😍</text>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>A massive outdoor space, with multiple large grass areas, several picnic areas, a historic miniature diesel locomotive train for children to enjoy as well as a historic carousel. This stunning open space also hosts a moderately sized body of water on which people sail and row boats. I loved coming here as a child and still enjoy it as an adult, I highly recommend if you'd like to bike, walk or simply get out for a breath of fresh air<//Text>< pictures>

Picnic spots by the lake are fantastic. The hiking paths are very suitable for a nice walk or biking. Parking costs 6 dollars but the amenities inside are in good condition. The barbecue stands are large for comfortable cooking so all you have to bring with you is the coal and the meat. I love this park!< /text>

Wonderful park by the lake that is great for a small hike. Lots of trees and a dam. I wouldn't recommend biking there unless biking with kids, it is a very easy area.< /Review>

The kids railroad, the beauty and this is where I grew up,picnics,parties,ponds with geese,as a child they  were swans. This has so much history and no one cares. Such a local icon. The lake feeds down into Los Gatos Creek.. always beautiful...might I add just feet ,less than mile from where Google,Red Box. Mall is changing ,many sales...come on and see what's up,down here.<//text>

Paved walking/biking paths in the park, good for a nice walk or jog. The paths are part of the larger bike path system, so you can either stay in the park, or just pass through as you head further north or south, on a longer ride. On the other side of the park there is a very popular train and carousel ride and a gazebo where they have performances during the summer.</Text></record>

Love this park. It is the best. I mean the worst, stay away from the great breeze and boat rentals. Pokemon stops, BBQs and ugly trees. Stay away!<//review>

Located south of San Jose, Vasona Lake county park is a great park for family gatherings. Ideal for picnics, birthday parties, kids train ride, boat rides and many other activities. It is also ideal for those who seek outdoor activities such as biking, running etc. The park also offers a great location for bird watching and nature observation. Definitely recommended!< /Text>

Vasona Lake County Park is a great park for walking, kayaking, picnics, and family fun while you relax. If you like feeding ducks, this is the place to be. More ducks here than at almost any park in Santa Clara County. Most of the park is very wheelchair accessible.< /text>

This review is for Fantasy of Lights.

The concept is nice but a few small changes would vastly improve the experience:
1. We reached on time at the entrance but the way was closed.  We tried to ask for directions to one of the men directing traffic, but he was extremely rude, shouted at us without any reason, and refused to answer any questions.  We asked another person directing traffic a little further and he politely and promptly answered us.
2. In order to get to the entrance, we had to take a 15-20 minute detour since most of the roads were closed.  This was not sufficiently advertised when buying the tickets, the only indication I found later was the sentence, "Event route may be different from online map routes" in tiny font at the bottom of the ticket.</Text>

Visited this park during"fantasy of lights" event. It was a drive through event and the place was filled with wonderfully decorated lights. The lights can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. $20 was worth 20 minutes drive. It gels well with the festival/holiday mood!</Text>

Beautiful park in Los Gatos! Parking is not free, but  I think it is worth it. There is lots of room to walk or bike or run. Lots of green areas for picnics, some picnic tables here and there too.

There is a nice reservoir in the center of the park. There is also a very cool kids railroad running across the whole park. For Xmas the park also puts together a light show.

This is also a dog friendly park, so you can walk with your pooch anywhere you feel like.

Lovely park!</Text>

<review>Close to nature...one of the best parks in bay area. Lot of trees to hangout on a sunny day. Lake side is peaceful. Parking is $6 and can easily get parking spot even on a busy day or weekend.

Good place to take a walk. There is a small train that kids can ride on. A fee is required to ride. There are some picnic tables. The group picnic areas requires fees. There is a lot of grass area in the park. There is a lake where you can go boating. There is plenty of parking but fees are required to park inside the park. If you are a resident, you may park inside Oak Meadow Park for free. The park is right next to Vasona Lake.< /Review>

Good park. It is usually plenty of parking. They recently changed the parking payment system and instead of buggy payment machines payments are collected by park staff. Good lake view. This place is popular for birds as well, so be careful when you walk on a grass because of litter.</Review>

<text>Its a great park and is spread widely. It has multiple bbq spots and open fields. We went there for our team event and I really enjoyed there. They also have boating options but we didn't do that. We did bbq and played games in open fields. There is a parking fee of $6 for full day. Lots of options for kids play area. During Christmas they also have great lighting throughout the park. Definitely a great place to spend your day and just relax. Lots of restaurants option nearby as its located near downtown Los Gatos.< /text><userid>117527965083696146772<//userid>< date>

<Review>Horrible, I'm sure the park is a hoot! The festival of lights is a joke after sitting in an endless line of cars only to get to the gate and was told the only we can get in was to buy   an online ticket that was never advertised and it was sold out for a simple drive through the park 2 hours after it opens!?? pretty ridiculous and a waste of time I wouldn't waste the time or the energy to watch another one of those shows,👎👎👎👎👎</Review>< pictures>

I like this place, it is full of life and happiness. There are a lot of geese around the lake, they are beautiful. We saw some little cute rabbits too. The park is perfect for families, the children love this place. :)< /Review>

<Review>This is a nice Park to come and have a picnic. There are lots of different areas you can go and sit, benches around the park and water area or nice grassy areas for sitting on the ground in the shade. When I went it wasn't crowded and we walked around, took pictures by the bridge and sat and watched the birds. The only thing I would say to watch out for is bird poop, just watch your step. But it's a beautiful Park and a nice place to walk around.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The plane. It's been there since before my time.  All kids (big and small)still love it. The park also has one of the last "tall" playgrounds left in our overly zealous safety conscious society (plus a couple other scattered playgrounds on the acerage of park). Then there's the lake that's nice to just walk next to on the paved path (watch out for newbie bikers though) and you can also rent kayaks and paddle boats...plus take a ride on a carousel or hop on the little Wildcat train then grab a snack at the shack and wander over to hear the summer concert series. Just don't feed any critters!</text>

This place is a jewel of a park in a jewel of the little village of Los Gatos. With a lake, tons on picnic areas, rental boats, ducks, playgrounds and even a railroad and marygoround GREAT for families, business event and even reunions. This park has a real sense of recapturing a nostalgic time when places like this were common and now it is extraordinary. My hats off to everyone involved in preserving the lovely park.</Review>

Only went there at night for the Fantasy of Light. Lightings were great and beautiful but a bit short of a wow. The Vasona Lake we happened to have driven by was breathtaking. However, the traffic management before the event was a bit confusing and we were not even allowed to use the park before the event.</review>

The carousel and train were so fun for my three kids. There is a $6 parking fee to park in the parking lot, but if you can find parking on the street that's for free. Hard to find street parking on the weekends, but during the week you may find it. Just be aware you'll most likely have to walk down a hill to get down to the vasona park, playground area.</review>

Went here for 2017 December night light show drive through. Kids enjoyed well. It is seasonal light show and should not be missed. Book tickets in advance via eventbrite. Be 30 min before because the queue can be long.</Text>

One of the best places to get a good run. Lots of runners, beautiful landscape, geese, ducks. This connects to the Los Gatos Creek trail too. The proximity to Los Gatos downtown also means access to great coffee and food right before or after the time at the park.<//Text>

I have great childhood memories of this park.  Renting sailboats, playing soccer and riding the train.
Now that admission is charged and the park has gotten more crowded I haven't been back in years.
It should be nice now (spring, 2017) with all the runoff filling the lake better than it has been in years past.<//Text>

The park has allot of amenities and is great for family's with lots of kid friendly attractions. The rentable picnic areas have nice BBQs and are well maintained. There is a miniature train that you ride around the park in. A babbling creek that runs through it also. There is also a carousel you plant you children on for a few minutes of relief.< /Text>

Awesome place for picnic with friends and family. The grounds are nice. Lots of parking. There is a nice little toy train and a carousel to liven up the kid inside you. The lake is pretty good for leisure kayaking, canoing and paddle-boarding.<//Review>

It's a nice park especially now that the bike paths have been upgraded. Enjoying the Nature's day or Persian New Year celebration which occurs almost every year in Vasona park at the end of March / beginning of April.< /text>

Great place to spend a day with the kids. The train is a favorite of the kids. The children's playground is huge. You'll likely go here for the paddle boats or canoes. Great fun.</review>

Always a nice park to visit.  Usually pretty clean and the size is big enough that it feels more like a trail than a park.  I've been going here since I was a little kid and have always loved it.  6$ for parking.</review>

<review>The park itself is amazing, and is huge! Lots of great locations for photos, a playground, and a super fun Christmas light driving path during the winter season. The main disappointments are paying for parking every single visit, and the hours are not the best (gates close pretty early at times). Otherwise, definitely a good spot.<//review>< resp>

<review>One of THE most meditative & peaceful park/lake areas I've ever been to, even with the park noise of kids playing and family bbq parties. It's just a great atmosphere.  If you are in the area, you owe it to yourself to stop by & check it out, even if for a few hours.< /review>< user_id>

<Text>Beautiful country park with trails, a carousel, a train ride, a lake, a science education center, self-guided arboretum walk, playgrounds, picnicking, boat rentals and lessons.  Be prepared for a modest parking fee...or pick up an annual pass at the parks office which is within this park.< /Text>< username>

<text>Stunning park with huge lawns & well spaced picnic benches overlooking a tarmac trail winding through woods, alongside the river & Vasona Lake. Open kayaks, Paddle Boards & Peddle Boats are available for rent & a small train tours the grounds. Parking is chargeable but it's free to walk through using the Los Gatos Trail.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>This park is great in its diversity.  There are playgrounds, excellent biking and rollerblading paths, picnic areas and a pretty man-made lake.   There is a lot of parking although it does get busy on weekends.   This is an especially nice park for families.   It connects with the Los Gatos trail which extends where you can get on bikes.   The only thing it is missing are enough wild areas and native habitat.  You need to go further up into the Santa Cruz mountains if you are looking for that.</Text>< pics>

Greate place for picnics and open air  activities. Our family love this place. It has open fire grills, tables, water. Be careful playing on a grass. There are a lot of geese in that park :)<//Review>

<review>Great park for the entire family. Boating, picnic areas, walking and bike trail, sitting by the Creek or walk over to Oak Meadow park which connects to Vasona and take the kids for a ride on the Carousel or the train.  BBQ grills are available in the park at the picnic tables and group areas.
Playgrounds are available too.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>It's a lovely place to walk along a gurgling creek, or on the newly paved bike and walking trail along the lake... If you like walking on asphalt, dodging bicycles, being sniffed by dogs, and being run over by kids on tricycles!

... Actually, I really like Vasona Lake!</Review><rate>4<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>A lake, a creek, a bit grassy hill, tons of grass, a train, BBQ places, tree shades, what else can you ask? This park is a nice park to visit with family during weekend. Did I mention there is also boat renting? Before you sit on the grass - especially near the lake, just beware of the geese and the mess they left.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

A Los Gatos institution offering scenic, lakeside trails, picnic and barbecue areas and recreational paddle boat and kayak rentals. Vasona shares the grounds with iconic Oak Meadow Park, which offers wonderful playgrounds, carousel rides and a tour of the parks from the vantage of a miniature "steam engine" train.< /Text>

Vasona lake is beautiful location to walk around and there is a creek trail that connect Campbell to Los Gatos by bike, hike or running. From city to city one way is about 11 miles. I love it.< /Review>

Nice place for a walk but I wish they could extend the trail so you can walk around the whole lake without going on the street. Good place for picnic but must find a spot away from the birds.<//review>

<Review>Great park. Well maintained, many different pieces of apparatus to have fun on...from children safe firetrucks and fighter jets (mixed amungst normal jungle gyms), baseball fields, soccer fields, to an actual steam train that offers rides and a vintage carousel...all connected by a large network of walking trails. There are many sporting groups that meet in this park as well. I've come here as a child, adolecent, and now adult. Oh, Christmas light drive through attraction during the holidays and there is a theater company that offers shows as well. Really a great park.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>A very nice park with a lake right in the middle of it, and lots of wildlife from squirrels to ducks and geese. Perfect for biking, jogging, walking the dog, or just a simple stroll through nature.<//text>< Pictures>

I have grown up going to this park, there is tons of space for birthdays and lawn games. Lots of bbq pits for the family cookouts. The fact that there is a walking path that connects to oak Meadow is a major plus!< /Text>

< Review>
What a great park, we went on Sunday March 4th and there were alot of trails and pathways closed due to construction, but Oak Meadow park was open and functional. Train rides are $3.00 per person, well worth it to see the kids having a blast on a narrow gauge train. I remember riding on it when I was a kid and I'm now in my 40's. Thank you Town of Los Gatos AND Santa Clara County parks system for reminding us how important it is to help save and keep parks like this with in our towns and city's<//Review>

Definitely one of the better parks within silicon valley, operated by Santa Clara County, on the north end of Los Gatos near the border of Campbell, also bordering CA-17 freeway. The park is surprisingly quiet for being that close to a major freeway. Generally it is $6 for parking/entry fee per vehicle unless you have a pass. Facilities include extensive picnic grounds (some pre-reserved for group events, the rest first-come-first served). There is a lake with paddle boats, canoes and paddle-boards rental, and the county park is adjacent to a city park where there is a rideable scale-model train whose track goes thru part of both parks.

Vasona also has fairly extensive walking and bike trails, and lies within the larger Los Gatos creek trail, so traffic on foot and on bikes, goes thru Vasona park, between the endpoints of Downtown Los Gatos and the Willow Glen neighborhood of South San Jose.

There are also regular music concerts on saturday afternoons during the late spring and summer, near the boat house.<//Review>

Running, biking, walking dog, bird watching, to play with kids, boating, fresh air, yoga, picnic, volley ball, christmas lights, other events and many more reasons. Dont forget the train ride :) kids and adults both enjoy it. Wave to people as you pass thats more fun!

The park landscaping is being torn up with trucks everywhere. Large areas are blocked off and I was unble to cross the large, red bridge.  Many of the areas that used to be grass are dirt.  When a park is in this condition there should be no charge to enter, but the parking validation machine is at the entrance and the work being done is not visible.<//Text>

With its many nooks and groves, and the Creek Trail running for miles in two directions, it'll be a long time before you run out of places to explore from this lake.<//Text>

<Text>Vasona Park looks like it's been forgotten about. The plants, trees, and the area that are for planting. Have been neglected. The park itself has been neglected. Sad to see this going on. In the middle of Los Gatos. What is going on with the fund's? Anyone have an idea 💡🤔<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The parking fee is $ 6 per day. There are park grills and benches inside and there are lots of ducks. Canoe, kayak, paddle boats, etc. can be rented at $ 20 per hour. Good value for money.

1일 주차비가  6달러 입니다. 안쪽에 파크 그릴과 벤치들이 있고 오리가 엄청 많습니다.  카누 카약 패들보트 등을 시간당 20불에 대여해서 탈수 있습니다. 6불 값어치를 하는 좋은 공원입니다.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

(Translated by Google) Nice lake, however it is very busy and does not have much "personal" space. To stop for a snack and then follow your path is perfect.

Bonito lago, sin embargo es muy concurrido y no tiene mucho espacio “personal”. Para parar por un snack y después seguir tu camino es perfecto.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) [Looking at Los Gatos' Vasona Lake County Park] This park not only has beautiful lake views, streams and wide green lawns, but also builds a machine room and train station, as well as a track of nearly a mile, along the Vasona Lake area. A long steam train is full of passengers running in the park, making Los Gatos' Oak Meadow Park a park with a small train and a retro carousel.

(Original)
【逰览Los Gatos的Vasona Lake County Park 】这座公园不仅有美丽的湖景、溪流及宽阔的绿色草坪，还在Vasona湖區旁，建造了機房和火車站，以及近1英里的軌道，让一辆长长的蒸汽火车滿载着乘客在园内奔驰，使得Los Gatos的Oak Meadow Park是矽谷同時具備小火車與复古的旋轉木馬的公園。</text>
