<Text>Same day Birth Certificate copy for $28. I paid cash. Bring your ID. I went on a Thursday before 11 AM and there was only one person in front of me. You can fill out the application online if you want to have everything ready. I didn't, so I used their computer. It was fast and easy. I completed everything in about 15 minutes!<//Text>< user>

When you walk into the building on the left hand side they do marriage licenses and birth certificates. They have 4 windows open. It gets really packed in the mornings. On the right hand side they have recordings for Real estate and for business licenses and for notary filings. They usually only have 2 windows on the right hand side so be ready to wait about 45 minutes. I have been to this recorder at least 10 times and I've never been here less than 45 minutes. Make sure your forms are printed out and ready to go before you get to the counter.</text>

<Review>This was pleasantly a nice visit. I went here to get a birth certificate and skipped having to wait in line to do the computer work and went directly to the line for picking up my certificate because you can conveniently apply for it from your phone! So while I was waiting in line I filled out the questions and by the time I got to the front I was done, made time go by fast. Then I was nervous that I'd have to come back because I didn't have master card, discover, or American Express and they still took my credit card. The lady behind the counter was so nice and quick. I am thoroughly pleased with this LA registrars office and would gladly recommend it.< /Review>< user_name>

I highly recommend calling for an appointment before you go.  Four years ago when I went to qualify my notary commission, I waited forever. It was a zoo.
This year I called for an appointment, and spoke to a very nice helpful woman. She gets 5 stars. I will review again after I go.</Text>

Employees slow cooking the beans... No order, just chaos. Make sure you have at least a few hours in the parking meter. Ignore the people in the front soliciting you. Real estate and business filings are inside and to the right. Don't stand in the big line usually going out the door. That's for marriage licenses.</Review></record></dataset><record>

One window for document recordings and two for Fictitious Business Name Filings. They mainly don’t follow their own rules posted on their own website.  There are 1.3 million people alone that live in the San Fernando Valley and the County of Los Angeles demonstrates their lack of services to their residents that pay fee’s for such.  Come with coffee, be patient and try coming early in the day if possible.< /text>

Have patience if you go here.  It's a stereotypical government office experience.  After you pass the shady vendors, in sunglasses, trying to sell you something to do with a DBA, you walk in to a small room.  You need to read the tiny signs up on the walls and find your line.  If you want to record documents or a DBA, go to the right (as of 4/4/19).  I witnessed two people get in the wrong line and the staff made them go to the end of the line they should have started in.  The office should post signs so people know where to stand and be respectful of peoples' time.  I fortunately stood in the right line, but still waited 40 minutes for poor service.  This location makes the DMV look glamorous.< /Text>

Holy cow - they have dramatically improve their process. Came to get a birth cert and they have automated the application process. Came right before open - line of 15-20 ppl and got outta there in 10 min or less. Super pleased - and sweet and smiling employees.</Review>

Parked on the street, with meters.  I put it $2.00 in quarters for 2 hours.  Got to the Doors at 820am 10min before they open.  There were two lines outside, right side for some business/building thing, not sure.  Left line was for marriage/birth/death certificates. That's why I was there.  There were like 20 people in front of me.  We got a speech saying you needed to fill out the request form online.  (which I did ahead of time at home).  5/ windows opened up and I was out of there in 45min or so. Staff was friendly. Guard was friendly.  People getting there marriage license in full wedding outfits was a bonus.<//Text>

If you are planning to record something expect a waiting time between 1-4+ h. This is not an exaggeration. It’s a total disaster. HIRE MORE STAFF! OPEN MORE WINDOWS!</Text>

I was there today 3/17/2016 and waited for 40 minutes. When I went up to a clerk, she was extremely rude EXTREMELY RUDE!!!! She threw a paper back at me. What kind of CLERK throws stuff at you?
When I stepped outside to talk to my boyfriend to confirm the marriage ceremony schedule, she SERVED 2 other people. A guy was saying that he wanted license marriage, she stared at him saying that you mean LICENSE MARRIAGE?  Do you speak English? YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH? Let me find someone who can speak SPANISH. I am very easygoing person, working in education field who knows how to respect others. If that happened to any of my family members, I I think I would have been very mad and taken legal action.
When I asked her name, she said everything is set! I said everything is set! and asked her again, and she said her name was JASMINE.</Text>

This place is a zoo. Long lines no signs. Good luck finding which window you're supposed to go to, because there is no labeling, signs or directory to give you a clue who to talk to. And once you do find yourself at a window neither one of you will hear the other through the squawk box.<//review>

Don't go to window 3 in the doc filing room, there's a Nazi Armenian named Aida who will shut you down in a heartbeat!  She'll reject your documents be very rude, condescending and dismissive about it.  I should've known there was something fishy when the guy in front of me let me go ahead of him so he could go to another window.</Review>

<text>I waited in line for 3 1/2 hours to see a Clerk for the County Recorder.  It was ghastly.   They should have people take a number and be able to sit until called, as there were many elderly who were so faint from standing so long, they just left.   When I finally made it to a window, I was told that my documents were 'unrecordable'.  No explanation, no papers were handed to me explainng why, just a rude Clerk named "Ida Beitounia" (not sure of the spelling of last name).

I pressed her for more information, as my documents were indeed in order.  She claimed her supervisor said not to record Judgment Liens.  She was extremely rude and condescending.  County Recorders, under several Codes and Statutes are supposed to file papers that meet very minimum requirements, but not this jerk!

Think I'll travel to Norwalk from now on to file.  Never Van Nuys!!!< /text><UserId.>109576626321930503889<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80c29706ce651e0f:0x124565b05d0069a6</GmapID>< Rate>

<text>This is a really shady area where people are outside (non county workers) trying to hustle you for their business. I gave the lady a firm no and she let me go. Inside the building- we got a DBA on the right. The line was short but the building was not welcoming and felt like we were in a hospital. The place was dirty and filled with graffiti and markings.</text><user_name>Rosanna Chan</user_name>< gmap_id>

I don't know why everybody complains about this place came around 2:30 for a birth certificate. Filled out the form while I waited in line. Unfortunately the credit card system went down, even so with the walk to chase at the corner (and stopping for fruit) I managed to be done in under and hour.</review>

Slow and chaotic. They should all reservations for all services, not just some. The place also smells like a 70's hospital. Not sure how humans could move any slower.< /Text>

My experience has been pleasant so far, from the moment I called and set up my appointment they quickly scheduled us in within a reasonable amount of time. They were professional and courteous. When we walked in it is very immaculate and the girl at the front desk was very friendly and they got us in right away. I was telling my son the vibe here feels great and so far so good I feel good bringing my teenage son here. Then we got to the price $11000 that hurt ouch.<//Text>

I have had the good fortune of having Alondra Hernandez and Dr.  Ivy Yang as my dentist for a few years now! From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave you feel welcome and a positive energy. I truly recommend Dr. Ivy Yang.

Alondra, is very professional and always with her positive attitude make you feel like home. It's always a pleasure to stop in and leave with a clean smile. On top of that Alondra and Dr. Yang gave me my first crown and made me feel like a KING.<//Review>

Dr. Lin is amazing. I don't like going to the dentist but I have never had a problem here. Everyone I have spoken to has been nice and helpful. The only complaint comes from my mom. They always mess up her bill and she has to get it fixed.< /text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I'd give zero stars if I could.  The Dr was sloppy, and too quick with the exam, she didn't even complete the cleaning as soon as she knew I wasn't getting the treatment they recommended there. When I asked about her about finishing my cleaning with the ultrasonic she got very wide eyed, and when I mentioned if she didn't use the ultrasonic it would be considered a polish and not a complete prophylaxis I finally had her attention. I never mentioned that is my profession.  I do dental billing, and have been in the field for years. They are terrible no care for customer service.  They just want the money. When they know you're not paying they disregard you. I wasted my time,  and that's sad. I cleaned my own teeth better with my sonic care toothbrush< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I was kinda concerned about going here, because of all the reviews. But I had an excellent experience. Everyone was sooo nice and patient with me since my husband's employer switched insurance company, so they couldn't find my insurance in their system, so they asked me a few questions and about 10 minutes everything was good to go. Doctor Rodriguez was nice. I'm looking forward to coming back in the future for all my dental care. Thank you stadium dental for making my first time here a nice and welcoming experience.< /text>< gmapID>

<Review>Really disappointed...was inferred by someone close to come here, but things have drastically gotten worse in the last 5 years. Every time I show up im greeted with faces I don't recognize...new dentist, assistant, hygenist, etc. I find it extremely irritating that I have to deal with new people examining my mouth and teeth every time I have an appointment, and nobody seems to be very knowledgeable. I feel sorry for the good employees who want to give good experiences for customers, they chose the wrong place to work for. This place is becoming like a college internship site. If you go here, ask to have the same dentist or hygenist for future appointments, as you'll get stuck with new hires that don't have any experience cleaning teeth.
They also try and sneak in unnecessary services with your bill, which is a pathetic practice. Be sure to ask what they are about to charge you for before you let them do work.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80904079fca43ab5:0xa5a1fce35701a08c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Their scheduling and customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. I've been trying to get in for my appointments for 5 months and I've been always canceled on and rescheduled. I can't wait to call my insurance company to find a new facility and never deal with this place again.< /text>

My family has been going to Stadium Dental for many years, and I've had mixed experiences, including one that caused me to leave the practice for 2 years (one dentist told me I couldn't be in the room while my 6 year old had a cavity filled; we walked out. I confirmed this was not common practice before we returned.).

Yesterday, by luck of the draw, my 9 year old had Dr. Bhangu fill their cavity. We had not worked with Dr. Bhangu before, but I immediately requested he be made my child's primary dentist. My kid has no ill feelings about dental work, but is very sensitive: ticklish, needs to know what's going on all the time, always forgets to keep their mouth open. At least 3 dentists have said they were unable to complete work on my child, mid-procedure. Dr. Bhangu was exceptional, keeping my child informed and engaged with age appropriate banter and lightning fast dental work.

My kiddo has never had such a great trip to the dentist, and was very excited when I told them Dr. Bhangu would be their dentist from now on.<//text>

I have been coming here for years and EVERYTIME I have an appointment they are running late.  I showed up 15 mins before my appointment time today and I am still sitting here waiting to be called back, 30 mins after my appointment time.  Thier "solution" was for me to reschedule because I have somewhere else I need to be in an hour.  Why should I have to reschedule and come back just to wait again because YOU were running late?  I'm not sure I'll be back after this.<//Review>

<Text>Best Dentist office ever...!!! This place was recommended by a friend, I went there for the first time with a dental emergency. They did what six Dentists and one Endodontist couldn’t do, their office equipment its so advanced, quick and precise. No pain. Love how they have a monitor in front of your patient chair so you can see your xrays and see what’s going on with you deltal health. The staff is so professional and friendly but what matters to me is how they resolved my dental problem fast and professionally. Its a whole team of experts the Dentist, Endodontist, Periodontist, the receptionist, and the financial staff to help you pay for you dental expenses. It was like i had my own personal financial advisor, they help you find discounts, dental insurance that pays the most for your dental treatment.  Honestly im happy i spent my hard earn money on quality dental care. So worth it. We need more dentists like these in the Valley.<//Text>< Rating>

Although the quality of the dental care is adequate, customer service and billing are extremely horrible and Kafkaesque. Instead of explaining additional after-the-fact charges, billing immediately activates debt collection agencies to hound confused patients.

Furthermore, the corporate culture seems to be all about pushing expensive procedures early and often.  I have never been to a dental clinic that is so pushy with (necessary?) procedures and additional add-on services.

I suggest you avoid Stadium Dental and all Pacific Dental Services (their mother company) clinics as one can find good dental care elsewhere without the aggravation and denigration.< /text>

Signed in, sat and waited for a half hour without anyone in the office acknowledging while I was there. Another person walks in and they take her immediately. I sat in the front and was the only person in the waiting room. I had to listen to the 4 ladies in the front gossip until 3:25 and I was there 10 mins before my 3pm appt. This is just the last of the incompetence I had to deal. I'm removing my while family and taking my business elsewhere.<//Text>

Haven't been to a dentist in 15 years, extreme anxiety. Could barely eat anymore on either side of my jaw so I had to go in. I have zero complaints, everyone here is awesome. Sure the bill is a bit steep but they do the job right and want it to last.<//text>

Is there a -20 Star? My daughter went there this weekend and the incompetent staff who attempted to do an IV satiation on her only managed to rupture one full arm. Then left her alone in the room crying and shivering for almost 30 minutes before someone came in and gave her a blanket and checked on her stats.

It does no good to have a dentist, who for what I can tell was not bad, if you have a bad staff. Also more than a little mad that he pulled a tooth vs doing what it took to save it or crown it.< /review>

I was 12 minutes late to my dental surgery appointment and they refused to do my surgery, irregardless of the pain I was in, they refused to complete the surgery. Then instead of making a quick appointment to help me out they offered me an appointment two weeks later.
I asked to get my money back and they refused. I asked to get my x-ray money back so I could go somewhere else and they refused, so I have no other choice but to go back to this very uncomfortable place were they belittled me for being 12 minutes late.
I can't remember the name of the receptionist but she was extremely rude. I guess if you pay up front, and in full they have the right to treat me badly because they have the ability to make me have to go there by refusing to pay me back.< /Review>

<Text>I'm using my husband account to write this review.

If any body read review about this place I hope it help you guys.

I would give this place no star for the rating if I could.

I had my wisdoms teeths removed on 8/20/2016. With the Dr. Thomas Phan. 2 days after surgery I found that I have big hole on my gum. Look like whatever they did to close that part came out. 2 days. And I have dry socket. The bad thing is. The hole is so big. I can see my jaw bone inside the hole.

Basically my jaw bone is out and the air or any thing I eat will touch it. And it being up very bad pain. No pain killer can help when it comes to the nerves system. I can't even drink regular water without my tear drop from how much pain I have.

And the recommendation was to use ice to help with the pain. It work great if I don't have to work after a week. So I went in to see the dentist and ask for help. I have Ice pack with me when I went in. Dr. Nakata told me that I shouldn't be using the ice. He said I'm slowing down the healing process. And his attitude was bad. Like I was doing something wrong.

So I was like. Wth? One Dr. Said to use it and than another said it bad. On top of that. They fill up the hole with the paste. But it only last one day. So I have to keep going in to refill it.
Last time I went in is the 8/27/2016. And the surgeon Dr. Phan refill the paste for me. He said it should last 5 days. 2 hours later it came out. And I didn't even eat anything.

This place is horrible. I do like some people that work there but mostly it is all about money. If they don't get pay they don't want to help. Matter of fact last time I went in I got the comment that said  "hopefully we don't have to refill the paste for you again. " and that was repeat many times.

My dry socket wouldn't close up for the next year also. But they told me my skin should cover up my jaw bone in 2-3 weeks. Well, it had been over 3 weeks. I can still see the bone in there. No skin. So now I'm stuck in pain. And I hate the horrible service so bad that I'm not coming back there ever again. My husband refuse to go back there for the last few years because every time he goes in they always try to sell him something. Now my family will never go back there.

I hope they read they reviews and see this. I don't mind to say they names because people should have the right to know. At first I wasn't gonna write any review. But I keep asking if there is anything they can do to help me. All I got was no. And that I have to wait until it goes away.

I hope this useful if you thinking about going there. And I'm happy for all of you that have good experiences. I hope it remain that way

Best.

The doctor was very nice, and was quick too! I had a nice and easy time understanding my options after a quick review I also had a good understanding of the money side of it. I forgot to thank the assistant when she was there so send her my regards, though I don't think I ever caught her name so just thank them all for me :)</Text>

<text>Three employees, one answered my first question the disappeared  in the back.
Then I tried to get the attention and assistance of the other two, very busy in their conversation, expecting customers to take care of themselves.
I called AUTO ZONE and yes, they have what I was looking for, and they believe 40 dollars is a good enough amount to acknowledge customers.
Auto Zone: 2 miles drive: 5 min.

Time wasted being ignored in O'Reilly's 11 minutes, and my groceries getting ruined.< /text>< Pictures>

I was having battery problems on my Camry and honestly didn't know what I needed to do. I don't really know anything about cars. I went in and Christian helped me choose the recommended battery for my car. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you Christian, you were a big help. I will definitely be back to this store.< /review>

Not sure if it's true or not. Could be fake news. But I was informed from a very good mechanic that O'Reilly uses refurbished parts and tries to pass them off as brand new parts< /Text>

Some of the best service you could ask for. On the rare occasion that they don't have a part you need they will try their hardest to get you it. I have had some crazy problems that they are always helping with. Would strongly recommend to anyone trying to get parts.</Review>

Employees are not too smart, or quick to help.
Just because you don’t have a specific OEM air rubber hose, doesn’t mean I can’t use some other one. It does not have to be Honda or Ford specific. It’s a freaking 4 inch rubber air hose (no liquid has to go through it)!
C’mon, think outside of the box and don’t be so slow!
I ended up getting a part from Lowe’s, plumbing department.</text>

Great service!  I needed a replacement bulb for the rear turn signal of my Ford F150... O'Reilly's website showed me which part I needed and told me it was in stock.  I will be going here for all my auto part needs in the future.</review>

I tried to give Mindy the benefit of the doubt, but she burned my hair and scalp with bleach three times and messed up my haircuts. The third time she burned my hair, it was so bad that I had sores and scabs on my scalp. No doubt it’s from my scalp being burned and then her scraping a comb across the burns while rinsing the beach out. I kid you not I had bleach on my head for almost an hour with her only checking on me twice before I finally had enough and said my head was really burning. Don’t ever go here. Don’t ever recommend them. Waste of money, time, and you will end up wishing you went somewhere else.< /Text>

<Text>Mindy is phenomenal! She cuts exactly which type of haircut I want and color every time. I trust her judgment with my type of hair as she provides honest details and needs for my hair.  If I show her a photo of what I want, she gives me her opinion based on the type of hair I have with the results. She takes care and knows how I want my hair. 100% satisfied and continued customer. Prices are always fair and never over priced.</Text>< Pictures>

The lady has no patience and she was being rude to me when I told to cut my hair not to short
The ambience is bad and I have got the worst hair cut ever ..
I could have given zero rating but unfortunately I have to give only 1.
None of them knows how to cut hair here</text>

I’m so proud hair. She doesn’t age. Good job Mindy! Love you. Mindy is like my sister. Now my mom has gotten older and she still comes here lol. Now my brother is Mindy’s new customer.

Please don't go to this place ever. She only cares about money and number of customer. In 3-4 mins, she will finish any type of hair cut and force you to leave as all done and good and charge 13 dollar. She doesn't know english, good behavior and obviously hair cut. If you want to make your look really bad, i would suggest you to visit.<//Text>

<Text>They dont have any experience of hair cutting. They cut my hair like my mom was doing when I was 3 year old.

Changed my hair style. Very bad experience.
Will never visit this salon again.< /Text>< time>

My husband went there few times as there were no options. Worst ever hair cut I have seen. That Japanese lady charges 13 dollar for that bogus hair cut. She does hair cut for male in literally in 2 mins and she will force to leave after that and will say all good.</Text>

Very nice lady there. She saved my hair lol. I went to great clips or something like that and they made my hair look horrible... like a mushroom or wishing troll and all i asked for was a trim. The next day my sister tried to fix it but failed but i went here and she was able to fix the damage< /review>

They messed up my hair so bad!!! I showed them a picture and I clearly told her how to do it but she didn’t even listen to me and she did how ever tf she wanted!!! Never ever go their! After she messed up my hair she started yelling at me when she was the one who messed up my hair! This unacceptable!!!  They don’t even deserve 1 star!<//review>

An inexpensive haircut close to home - what more could I ask for? The haircut was typical for me - short and sticking up requiring me to use product until it grows out a bit. Difficult to beat the cost, though. And I haven't seen more expensive chains do better cuts.<//text>

I was rushed, and the person did a pathetic job. The total hair cut was done in less than 4 minutes, and a lot of hurried, corner cutting took place. Worst place for a haircut</review>

Worst experience in a saloon ever.
The lady was so rude and annoying.
I don't even feel like giving 1 star. Avoid this saloon at any cost.</text>

<username>Tara T</username><Date>1532130699591<//Date><rating>2< /rating><Text>See my other reviews (much more on Yelp with better choices for LA Fitness locations). I have been a member for decades (when a lot of LA Fitness locations were Ballys ' Total Fintess. The merge brought about changes (obviously) and some were good and many were not. Let me be clear, LA Fitness is cheap. They closed steam rooms in most of the facilities, they made smaller saunas in remodels except for West LA (no idea why there). They shortened open hours (this location is 11pm on weekdays (except Fri and earlier on weekends)). The Encino facility has gone downhill at least 50% since the merger with Ballys (where  I was an original member). I was grandfathered' in when they were bought out. I am beyond annoyed at the following: the old school stairmasters (not the moving stairs and not elliptical) freeze after just one session (around 30 min). I go 60 so, I have to go to another machine. Meanwhile, the other machines blow so, thanks for that. These same machines work way more efficiently (they are old school) at the Miracle Mile location. The shower curtains (used to be doors) are super cheap and see through which is just plain nasty! The lockers are an abomination (see the attached photos for a sample). I ask: how hard is it to put some dang hinges on the freakin' doors of the lockers?! There is only one electrical outlet that works in the locker room to dry your hair so, good thing I go at night  and it is nearly empty (only really good thing about a visit here). This is shameful! Additionally, the steam room was kept (probably because they do not have a sauna). The steam used to go constant but now, it barely produces any steam and cycles run around 12 minutes. This is poor mans' (womans) steam.. There are way better locations so, this is a very rare visit when I go.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7V79sYcfNoMqKXGqpj-af8Z2jugIFh8it_XxI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB1tZo5WrDlyo0sG_zYCcZ8voVjZ4IAF0jzEwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2984afed5aca5:0x59b9ba1c32725504<//Gmap_id></record>

Find yourself walking around the gym finding an open bench or machine as you did outside in the parking lot looking for an open space to park. Then come to this gym.  It's true there are some old equipment and definitely smells but it has all you need to get a good sweat and workout.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This gym is terrible to say the least. When something is out of order, it'll be out of order for months and months. The front desk is always busy on the phone hounding people for payments yet they won't take the money and time to fix the equipment. On one occasion it was 90 degrees outside and they didn't have the fans working ! We had to wait 3 days before they could get it fixed! I've been to 5 different LAfitness and they've all been decent but this one is just down right terrible.</Review>

The worst gym I've been to. And I've been to many LA Fitness locations. Staff was rude! Machines are old! I was nervous to get on the stairmaster. And NO POOL! Only good thing was parking.< /text>

Old, rusty and stuffy. This gym is not like any other la fitness I have been to. I have been going to LA fitness for years and always been happy until I moved to the Encino area and now I am stuck with this place.</review>

Manager and associate in this club lied to me at the time of registration and they didn't respond all 5 times when I back to them. I really don't care about the $400 they charged me, but what was significant when I contact their corporate office they ignored me too. So, I realized this company is a gang and steal from people the same as they stole ftom me. So, be careful and do not give them your real Bank Card.
I change my mind to attend because when I realized this place is so dirty and had the same experience with another LA fitness so I decide to not attending this club.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Everything is too old, and worthless to pay that much of money per month. I hope,they will improve the place, as it’s really not what I’m willing to pay for.< /Text>

Little messy, smelly, but hey, it's a gym right? ! LOL Plus it's not that busy and has the necessary equipment to get a great workout. So no complaints on my end. A gym is not meant to be a Spa...it's a place where you go sweat and get your workout.</Text>

< review>
I would give this place no star, it is very dirty, the machines are very old, outdated, no towels, no paper towels, the showers are moldy, look up at the ceiling along the tile walls, everywhere there is black mold growing. I would not go here ever again. All of the lockers and I"m not exaggerating here, are busted, broken and smell. People leave used things inside. It's gross, I will be calling the health department for them to check it out, I'm sure they will close this location. It's disgusting.

I did the 8 day free pass, because it was close to my office, but I'll drive to canoga to go, there is super clean, have as many towels as you want.< /review>

This is the gym that LA Fitness management forgot about.  The equipment seems to be from the 90s.  All the cardio machine have rust accumulated on them.  It is very dark in there and it feels like you are in a cave.  All the equipment are placed really close together and it feels very cramped.  There is only one squat rack and only one leg press machine.

The layout is awful.  For example, the benches that are close to the dumbbell racks are about 20 feet away.  You have to walk to the other side of the room, get the dumbbells you want to work with, then walk all the way to the other side of the room to get to the bench.  It is terrible.  This place should be either fully gutted and renovated or just shutdown.  This place is pathetic and an embarrassment to LA Fitness.

Some of the picture on here are very old and it doesn't seem like this place has even tried to improve at all.  Management here is non-existent it seems.  Stay away from this place!</Text>

small, very old equipment. Takes very long time to fix anything that is broken. It often gets too hot especially when crowded and there is no good ventilation.</Review>

I pay $100 for an alignment since my car was recently lowered, I got an alignment a couple of weeks back and it threw off my whole alignment, it worsened than before. I didn't want to make it a big deal so I took it somewhere else the next week. They made it happen just to climb the ramp & align my car. Now my car feels great and the alignment is perfect for driving conditions. I am sorry but I will not be coming back and do business here for an alignment. Probably a lift kit for a truck or 4 Runner but I will not get alignment here, as it has worsened.< /Text>

Let me say that these guys are awesome. My car was a mess to deal with and these guys went over and beyond to help me raise my disaster of a rust bucket. They by far understood my needs and did everything to get my car to my specs. I can not say thank you enough for helping me out as much as you did.<//Text>

Amazing, fast service! Spent 15 mins total there, including driving up, getting a new tire put on, and paying. $130 for a new tire with 6 month warranty and old tire disposal. He was honest that there are cheaper options but I wanted better quality, so hopefully this tire lasts! I'm very pleased with the whole experience. Everyone was so kind and helpful. I'll definitely be back.</text>

I went to them and was quoted 100$ for an alignment. Once I was on the alignment rack I was told it would be an extra 20$ because of how low I am. I told them that's fine so they hooked up my car and I was told my alignment was good and did not need adjustment. so basically I paid 120$ for them to tell me I dont need an alignment haha. I mean I guess they did do their job technically but they could have atleast just charged me what I was quoted since they didnt even touch my car. I have had multiple friends have bad experiences here and definitely would not reccomend.< /review>

<text>STAY far away from this place. My husband took his vechicle for service at opening at 8:30am describe issue his vechicle was having. Was contacted at 10:00am with a verbal quote via phone call and checked in for pick up time, Was assured it would be completed at that time . Arrived at 1:30 then quoted a new pick up time of 6:30 pm due to " circumstances out of their control as the manager stated". During the time of 8:30 and 1:30 there was no follow up regarding a need for extended repair time . When I attempted to follow up about the issue the next day manger was very unprofessional often interpreting  me during the conversation. Also proceeding to tell me he was a attorney and was planning to contact law enforcement as it is against the law to receive a quote via verbal call that HIS employee had done.</text><GmapID>0x809467e9fa932b03:0x62e281763621091d</GmapID>< user_name>

<review>Came to Blackstone tire to replace shocks. At first everything was settled and going great. Waited two hours going on three hours. Manager named Bob came in the lobby to tell me that the left rear bolt has been stripped and damaged. They recommended me to buy a new lower control arm because the thread for the bold is damaged and they can't do nothing about it. I believed them at first. I then inspected the shocks installed by them and noticed the right rear shock was installed on the left rear side. I confronted them about it and they denied everything, that I brought in the car like that. I had checked the car ahead of time knowing that the shocks were all in the right place. After a few minutes of disagreement, Bob was willing to give me a discount and reinstall the correct shock back on, but I was already upset the fact that they had already lied to my face and messed up the threads and bolt. I still paid for the three shocks they installed even though I could've not paid due to them damaging the left side. Good at first, worst experience at last . Suggest you guys try another place to replace shocks .<//review><name>Skyko Thao<//name>< Response>

I went to blackstone tire and right away they  got my car on the machine and aligned my car beautifully. Definatly recommend blackstone tires for good prices and good quality work. They also did my lowered lexus which 5 other shops wouldn't do my car because there rack was to high for my car. 5 stars for sure.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Extremely professional and did not try to sell me something I didn't want or need. Danny was my sales person who also installed my tires. I appreciated him showing me that I had a bent rim (which I already knew). Some wouldn't bother but would notate it and if you had any problems later, would immediately blame the rim that they didn't inform you about. Danny's a top notch guy in my book. My husband recommended these guys and I will continue using them. BTW Danny, Judas Priest ROCKED SF that weekend! Thanks for assuring my friend and I got there and back without a flat!!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

They had a great staff. The price was awesome. They gave me a deal on all four tires brand new and the service was complete in under 45min. Mounted, balanced all that !! They also work closely with tint pros and suggested I get tint from them and tint pros gave me a discount !! Great move. Great service. Great price. Get your services here for sure for sure.< /text>

< Review>
Took my car in for an alignment and although they weren't able to get the numbers I was hoping for, they were able to get them close enough considering the state of my bushings and the fact my car is most likely too low to achieve the camber setting I was looking for. They also had it done a lot quicker than I was expecting. However, I will not be returning due to the fact they said it would cost about $180 and take around an hour and a half to replace the alignment bolts with the ones I had purchased. Replacing them would take me at most half an hour in my driveway with hand tools, and up on the lift while already loosening them to adjust should only add a few minutes. It's as simple as removing and replacing a bolt x8. The price for the alignment itself was reasonable but I would stay away if you need anything else done.(Edit: Turns out the most likely original 30 year old alignment bolts they said didn't need to be replaced and that would cost "$180 to swap out" were in such bad shape that they weren't able to hold my alignment. Driving to work today (the day after the alignment) something at the rear end of my car felt loose. Went out on lunch and found that one of the bolts was able to be spun with a ratchet. There goes $120 down the drain.)< /Review>

Thanks to Rob who was very friendly and has been whenever I've seen him. He thoroughly explained warranty on our Hercules tires. Interested in our personal situation and best interests. The lyft driver who dropped us off to pick up our car mentioned. "I got my tires here for a very good price."<//review>

Let me tell you a story about Blackstone Tire.  Ray and Danny are the best.  I had 2 tires installed by another shop.  It wasn't until about 2 days after that I happened to be driving on the freeway, going 65-70 MPH.  I literally felt like my wheels was going to fall off or something.  It was scary.  I had to get off the freeway and drive on the streets.  I talked to a few guys and they told me it could be the brand of tires, it could be the road or it could just needs to be rebalanced.  I was going to take it to Walmart to balance it but they want me to wait about 2 hours.  TWO HOURS!! To balance 2 tires?  My dinner will be cold by then.  I called Blackstone Tire and Ray said come on it.  We'll take care of you.  I got there about 5:45 PM.  By 6:03 PM, I was done and driving home.  Whether you just need a balance like me or you need something totally different, don't go anywhere else before you see Ray.  His price is fair and just.  If ALL businesses do business like Blackstone Tire does, there wouldn't be any problems in the world.  So, if you want, you can even say TOU sent you.  He'll treat you like you are his brother from another mother.</text>

<Review>Outstanding customer service. I got four Cooper tires for my suburban and an alignment. Total: $500. Madera tire and auto center's quote for four Federal tires and an alignment: $681! Also, Blackstone Tire offers a guarantee, and Madera tire and auto center doesn't. Never going there ever again. I will always go to Blackstone tire.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1563603904805, 'text': 'Thank you John you’re always very welcome here!'}</response>< Gmap_id>

To be fair, my initial relationship with Mazda started out a bit rocky, however,  today's service absolutely changed my opinion. Took my car in for service, I was the first in line getting there at 7am. The staff was friendly and professional and I was out by 9:15 am and that's after they discovered minor recall. It was a good experience and I recommend this business 👌.<//Review>

Had a great experience with Concord Mazda service center today. My service advisor was Milica Ramos and she was very professional and explained all issues properly. They are constantly in touch via text messaging. They also have a very good pickup and drop off service  for your car within a certain mile radius - I'm glad I chose Concord Mazda!<//Text>

If you do take your vehicle there you'll definitely have to continue to call them to check on your vehicle cause they don't call back anybody. Pretty sad seeing how Mazda's are probably the best manufactured vehicles.< /text>< pics>

So unfortunately I clipped a raccoon and a piece of my trim came off. I needed a few clips, so I came here. I got to the shop about 10 minutes before closing after a long haul at work. I was immediately greeted by I believe a sales rep, who was quite nice and walked me back to the parts department. The two gentleman, one the parts guy, the other I believe a mechanic were super helpful. They both stayed after closing and really helped diagnosis and fix the broken clippies problem. I highly recommend this place...super friendly, super helpful, above and beyond customer service.
Also, when you enter the building, make sure you read the sign and pull on the door, instead of push, unless you wanna look like a jackass.< /Review>

I was pleased with my visit, because the staff was very personable, they are in a prime location near the highway, and the facility itself is clean and accommodates long waiting periods. The Cherry on top for me was that Chili's is located around the corner, so I will visiting more often and they can take their sweet time.</Text>

I brought my car in for 2 recall services to be performed and wanted to add on an oil change and tire rotation last minute. My appointment was in the afternoon, so they weren't going to be open long enough to do all of it. They offered me a free loaner car and said that they could have my car done by mid day the following day. They got my car done by 10:30 am and they did a great job! They were just so nice and helpful and offering a loaner car was a nice surprise. Highly recommended.< /text>

I brought my 16 year old daughters car in for air bag replacements and the 120,000 mile check. Chris walked me through what was going to need to be done to the car. The communication was fantastic and the car was completed within the time frame that I was told. The main reason why my experience is a 5 star is because when I went to pick up the vehicle, the amount that Chris quoted me was less by more than $200. What a nice surprise! Also, they had cleaned up the vehicle and you would never know that a teenager was driving it. Now the car is safe for her to drive and it looks great! The staff was fantastic as well from the drive to transport me to work and the cashier. Thank you Mazda Concord!.<//review>

If you want professionalism and courtesy, find a different Mazda service center.  These people are clowns.  They sit around doing nothing for an hour before checking you in.  They tell you directly they can't do anything to speed up when there's no one else waiting, and they either don't answer the phone, or hang up on you mid conversation.  Hopefully these people get retrained in customer service before this happens to anyone else.< /text>

I want to compliment on the service I received the morning of 02/11/20 to replace the air bag inflator due to a recall.   Service advisor Damien.  He has the personality and attitude that make him a special person who does an excellent job in assisting customers.

Damien's high level of professionalism, dedication and attention given to the customers should be commended.<//Review>

<Text>Alex and his follower Damien did a great job, going above and below to make the best use of my pre-paid service. They even re-loaded my software in case of bugs and paired my new phone for me. It all took longer than I expected but well worth the wait. While I was waiting and knowing I needed new tires I comparison shopped and found Mazda  had the best deal going though selection limited.<//Text>< user_name>

Went in for oil change and tire rotation. Tried to get roped into spending $400 for a 45,000 mile maintenance package that included things jiffy lube does with all their oil changes. Other than that,  everyone was nice and the car is running smoothly.</Review>

Staff is great.  They provide good coffee and some desks for people waiting, with wi-fi. In the past,  they have provided a loaner vehicle while my car was being repaired.  This particular visit was for a recall. No charge, and they did the usual visual inspection -- finding nothing that needed work. The only caveat I would offer is that on one prior occasion their price was a great deal higher for some front end work than a local shop. There may be good reasons for that, but I had the local shop do the work and the car is fine.<//Text>

They went above and beyond when I stopped by for a simple flat tire. They offered to do a full check-up, we’re extremely friendly, did their best to save me money, and made sure our wait was extremely comfortable! Would absolutely recommend.<//Text>

<text>Is difficult to write a negative review when the customer service was broken. This is the 3 time I took my car for the check engine light on. The first two time was smooth and according to expectation. The third time a cable from my engine was bitten by a rodent and they told me that the cost for the repair was $650.00 to fix it, So I almost paid with my credit card to do the repair but the manager told me because was a rodent i should use my Geico insurance that cover that issue. I when thru the insurance as advice and the cut me a check for $1,600 for the repair the damage. To my surprise at the time of the pick of my car the bill when from $650 to $2,600. I argue the bill with the manager, ending paying the balance to get my car and leave the building feeling disgusted.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Spring of 2019 I received a recall notice for our 2017 Mazda 3 5-door so I made an appointment to get it taken care of. I dropped off our car and came back later but was told the part was not available. I really hate setting up an appointment and have that happen but alas I figured it would just have to wait since I was not in the space to waste time. My dealership experiences were to be executed for one last time so I gave our Mazda 3 dealer another opportunity in the fall to correct it. November came along so I stopped by and had a chat with the service manager and told him of the issue and previous experience so he set me up with an appointment for our cars service. I would have to say after all said and done we were taken care of above and beyond the call of duty. Got the car in for its scheduled service and they detailed it & took care the recall issue. On top of that they gave me a ride home and picked me up...I call that service with me smiling and I will gladly recommend Concord Mazda Service anytime. For years I have avoided dealership services and worked only with independents but I would have to say Concord Mazda Service Center has changed my mind about that!  They are a force that will make you smile!<//Review><gmapID>0x808566df363f8e6b:0x4981b6aa71d7df9<//gmapID>< Date>

Concord Mazda will be the only place I’m having my Mazda serviced from now on.

Before Concord Mazda, I went to an independent garage to have some service done for my 75k milestone and was told that my supercharger needed to be replaced at around 1200$ in addition to other repairs. I took my car to Concord for a second opinion and they found that my supercharger was completely fine. The issue was a small cap leak that was incredibly cheap to fix. I walked out with more upkeep and repairs done to my car and still 800$ less than the independent shop.

The whole staff was kind and helpful as well. Lance was a very communicative service advisor. Completely worth the drive from the East Bay!< /text>

Mazda does it again for the best. Not only are they sticking to their guns with their customer service and loyalty they the different mileage times and as to when I should bring my car in for what. Concord Mazda is the reason why I'm making so much money with Uber and can decide to take the high road and pay the dealership company who made this wonderful car. Oh and by THEY? I mean the awesome customer service rep Alex himself. I think I got the name right. The guy with the handlebar mustache and goatee. Anyway. Yeah legendary customer service.< /Review>

We had a fantastic experience here thanks to the excellent customer service from Lance. When I initially called we thought the issue was with the key fob and he walked me through how to try something myself from home before coming in person. Then when we found the whole car battery dead and decided to bring it by for an evaluation after jumping the battery, he continued to make us feel very well taken care of. The car was ready for pick up hours before the estimate and they had no problem with us leaving the car there for the day since I wouldn't be able to come back until the following day. While I was initially intimidated by the expense that might be associated with a dealership service center, I was very pleased with my experience and recommend this place highly! Lance is the man!</text>

I drove in with an appointment made that day (in the midst of a tight schedule!) for a crucial tire repair and part order that helped me get back home 2,000 miles away.  I was called back almost immediately after booking online to work in a special time slot for the repair, which occurred only 2 days later for a part they had to source out of stock.  The staff were tremendously courteous, knowledgable, and timely.  I am amazed; I wish every other service bay in the US was like this.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I came in to a recall done on my Mazdaspeed3. The guys took amazing care of me and sent me home with a loaner. My car was ready in about 3 days but I wasn't able to pick it up until the weekend and they were very accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great service for their Mazda. The waiting room is also pretty cushy with a bunch of comfy chairs, TV's, and drinks for their guests.< /review>

<text>My husband took our car to be serviced at Concord Mazda Service Center and had a great customer service experience here!  The car was taken here for the 15k service and to have the brakes looked at.  Dave listened to our concerns about the squeaky brakes, then he explained what was being done to fix it and let my husband test drive the car afterwards to make sure we were satisfied with the results.  The waiting area is very spacious, clean and comfortable.  There is also good internet and coffee here, so you can work while waiting!</text></record>

<Date>1516515667199</Date><Review>Marin Mazda didn't anwer when I called three times in a day, and took a week to get back to me.  Concord, on the other hand, picked up the first time and was able to schedule me within a couple days.  They also were clear about pricing--$175 for a diagnostic.  When I got there, I sat down with Lance.  He was great, asking me all sorts of detailed questions about my problem and taking thorough notes.  He explained how they would approach the troubleshooting, what the labor costs were, and what I could expect time-wise.  He also printed me a map to BART when I declined their courtesy shuttle (it's only a 15 minute walk).  Within a couple days, they had identified and fixed the problem, and all for way cheaper than I'm used to walking away from any professional repair.

<text>Brought my vehicle in to be serviced, she wouldn't let me finish talking before she had to put in her to cents. I get my car back after the "service" and the problem still remains. In the service write up the problem I described wasn't even listed correctly! Probably because she WASN'T LISTENING TO ME.  I would highly advise going to another service center. They wasted my time and now I have to wait ANOTHER week for an appointment else where. Absolute garbage service.BE WARNED!!!!!< /text>< pictures>

< review>
Went in for a recall fix on my Mazda CX-9. Got in at 8:00 am got out an hour and a half later (this was not some minor fix.. nor a big one). This was the quickest service I ever had.

The location is...sparse but with all the amenities you can expect these days. Wifi, coffee, recharge station, desks, armchairs and TVs. Based on this visit
aone I would probably come here again.<//review>

<review>Sales staff were polite and courteous. However they didn't do what I asked for and instead tried selling me packaged things. They gave me recommendations such as changing my cabin air filter which I had just replaced myself. Opened up the dash and it was fine. Also my brakes started squeaking really bad as soon as I got in the car. I know the condition of my vehicle, they didn't have to make it worse to try and make a sale. Sucks when you go in for service and you get your car back in worse condition. Avoid this stealership service center unless you like buying things you don't need.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I dropped my car off a day in advance of my service appointment. When I returned the next day to pick up my car they could not find my car and had not even done the service. The manager never spoke with me or apologized for the inconvenience! If no stars was an option that's what they would get.  I had to ask for a loaner car if you can believe that. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!</Review>

Pre approved and ready to buy a CX9 on Friday told to come back on Sat to close deal. Upon arrival, asked again to see the invoice of the car ( from another store in SJ) before we signed agreement. 1 hr later, after giving a wrong invoice, asking to fill out a credit app (refused since I already had financing)  extended $$$ (refused). Tried to sell another car at thousands over invoice.  Patrick still could not and would not produce an invoice for the car they are saying they want to sell me??!!  "Patrick needs to see all of the documents."  was the last excuse.

Got enough of the stalling and demanded the invoice the last time. They finally came back to say they could not sell the CX9 since it was a GM's car. WHaaaaaaaaattt! I called Dublin Mazda while at Concord. I made sure Patrick knew my disappointment and absurd tactics used were unacceptable.

Happy Ending: Called Dublin Mazda while at Concord. 3 hours later drove home a new CX9 Signature. At a much lower price too.</Review><gmapID>0x808566df363f8e6b:0x4981b6aa71d7df9</gmapID>< Name>

The staff was friendly. My main concern was lack of follow-up, I asked for a quote by email twice on two separate visits and I still yet to have receive this quote all these weeks later. I did get an email template asking to them rate them, but that was it, my questions were never completely answered. We also we waited forever.< /Review>

This place never disappoints. I always visit during lunch hour and they are busy but never a wait. Inside ambiance is a cool/clean vibe and most of the offerings on their menu are yummy and options are adequate. Not too big portions, just perfect enough to feel satisfied and not have to unbuckle your work dress pants (maybe bc I get an entree plus fries to share). Value is good. Service is good.<//Review>

I don't come here often but honestly I should change that! The prices can be anywhere from the $12 a person to $20 depending on what you order but there are regularly options available for everyone.

The buckets and fish and chips are especially highlights, but if you're in the mood for raw oysters this should be a definite pin on your map.< /Text>

Just waiting for restaurants to re-open after long wait due to pandemic. Hands down the best. Generous portions and nothing but fresh seafood. Cioppino stands out.  Love the chowder with sour dough.<//review>

My girlfriend brought me here since they have really good fish tacos. I tried the blackened salmon  and smoked fish and the smoke fish was the best! They added a sweet relish and mandarins as a sauce on top which made them more refreshing. Good prices (they offer tacos Tuesdays here too and happy hour!) And quick service. Highly recommend!< /text>

<Text>I've been here a few times already. The previous times have been there for their taco Tuesday discount special which is awesome. Yesterday I went and tried the fish sandwich and was very happy with my choice. I'm a simple customer and a side of fries is always nice. But my main focus was on how tasty the fish sandwich was. I was not disappointed.

I went during lunchtime and was surprised that it wasn't too packed. It could have been my luck that time so I hope it's not too busy the next time I go. The service was quick. I ordered and had my food brought to me in about 5 minutes so I was able to enjoy my lunch hour without rushing. Overall, each visit is always a pleasure.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great spot for fish.  I ordered the smoked fish taco, which was the best fish taco I've ever had. The food is really fresh and not your typical lunch food.  I ordered the Brussels and broccoli which I would give five stars.  I would give the clam chowder 4 stars.  It was filled with lots of clam and potatoes but could have been more flavorful.< /Text><Time>1550091426421</Time><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

Taco Tuesday is amazing here! The fried fish tacos were crispy, but not greasy. The portions were generous too.<//Review>

<text>Inexpensive, well prepared seafood, including fresh oysters (I'm a fan) with a good selection of craft beers and wine.  Lots of healthy options.  Very clean and well staffed.  Deli style where where one orders and takes drinks to tables, inside or on a nice patio outside.  Then food is brought to table not long after.  Family friendly setting.  This time I had the Yellow Tail  bowl (broiled with a light sauce topping, with string beans and sticky rice) which was not highly seasoned and surprisingly very tasty.  My son and I have visited here three evenings recently. I really like the place.  It nicely fits into the slot between greasy junk food set on a counter in a paper sack, after standing in line listening for your number to be called on an intercom, and those too expensive, too long to wait, too much "pagentry" chain theme outfits that somehow always end up costing 50-75 bucks a head when all one really wants / needs is just fresh and healthy food in s sit down setting, promptly served without drama.<//text><user_id>111153559101336290760<//user_id><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

It's usually worth coming here for their Taco Tuesday deal with their smoked fish tacos. Otherwise, the fish tacos are much more expensive. Their fish tacos have plenty of flavors, especially with the smoky flavored fish is something that's unique. I don't really care for that mandarin toppings but something the tacos come out wet. For any type of food that's meant to be hold with hands, I much rather to enjoy them in one piece. I find it almost impossible to keep it in my hand sometimes. Their fish and chip and clam chowders are average.< /review>

<review>This is definitely a place that came highly recommended and lived up to the recommendation. I wasn't expecting to have my favorite foods Under One Roof at a price that I cannot believe they make any profit.

Excited to come back again and try the other plates I was not able to put in my mouth.

I recommend you try the lobster, all the tacos and the poke< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I really wanted to give this place all 5 stars except that the yellowtail picked up an off flavor from the grill. Everything else was great. I really liked the pesto sauce and green beans! Bright dining room that's clean and new! I'll give them another try.< /Text>

I love fast casual without sit down style wait staff. The look of the place is really nice for that in between casual and business feel. The food is fantastic, quality ingredients, and healthy. It's hard to name a favorite dish because I keep changing my mind. I've been here half a dozen times and I've gotten the fish tacos, Asian fishbowl, and fish sandwich a lot. The chicken sandwich is really good too for my friends that don't eat anything that swims. I recommend this place for anyone that's looking 4 fish at 40% off compared to anywhere else full service with the same quality.</text>< pics>

Edit: it's now $2.99 taco Tuesday, but it's still a pretty good deal!< /text>

If you do care about customer service and not feeling like a second class citizen, go elsewhere.  The food isn't that great (its order-at-the-counter type place; Fish District is better), and not worth feeling like you arent wanted as a customer.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Was ok not impressed with their grilled zucchini, or coleslaw(?). I expected a restaurant with servers as the fb referred to. Instead there was a cashier/ busboy who wasn't familiar with the fb promo. Might go back, not sure. The tabletops were sticky.</Text>

Got to try the Pier 76 Fish Grill finally, and was not disappointed. With the help of my knowledgeable server, Ana, I enjoyed a variety of sea food including the Connecticut Lobster Roll. I will be taking my husband and family back there soon and will definitely ask for Ana!< /text>

<review>😍😍😍
My dad and i came here after it was only open for 2 weeks and we already want to come back. I got the lobster roll (that’s what they’re known for) and my dad got the fish & chips. He is ~very~ particular about his fish and chips; he took one look at it when they were brought to our table and says “I found my new fish & chips place”. I’m not a fish fan, but I took a bite and i would probably order for myself.
My lobster roll was AMAZING; soft bread, plenty of butter, tonsss of lobster. If you love garlic then get the sea salt garlic fries. Definitely want to come here again. Beer, wine, and soda available.< /review>< pics>

Best salmon in town. The garlic & parsley fries actually have freshly minced garlic on them, not garlic salt.</Text>

OMG, there BBQ carbroiled fish is amazing it tastes better than some of the high end fish restaurants where you would pay much higher prices. It is absolutely terrific and so fresh! I would eat here every day if I could, total five stars.<//Review>

The fish dishes are a great value, and I'm always happy with the service. For those that don't eat fish, the kale Cesar salad is one of the best salads I've ever had.</Text>

<text>Absolutely Great Seafood and Service!
I’ve now been twice and both times loved what I got. The first time I had the Barramundi finished Mojo style and the second trip I had it done Pecan Pesto style - both were off the hook great! The employees are well trained and very knowledgeable and seem really happy. I also met the owner, Chris - super passionate about his restaurant and vision! This is my new go to seafood spot!<//text>< Pictures>

I didn't think the food was that good here compared to other fast casual fish places in the area.  The process are a fraction higher than the other place but, I don't think it's worth it.

I would not recommend it out go back.</review>

The fish and chips, they're just oh so good...lol, price is VERY fair. Compared to everywhere else that sells it for $16.99...$17.99...here is $9 for a modest to generous portion IMO.< /text>

<text>Solid food for the price. The ceviche was a bit odd, I wouldn’t order it again. It’s basically pieces of white fish on a plate with corn nuts. If you’re expecting typical ceviche (shrimp, fish, served with chips, etc), you’ll be disappointed. Otherwise the food was excellent. Great fast casual seafood at a decent price point. The smoked tacos were bomb as was the fish sandwich on brioche.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Decent inexpensive seafood place comparable to California Fish Grill. The menu is a little confusing...bowls and salads are grouped in the same category. Fish was prepared well but sides are not that great: fries and coleslaw.<//Review>

<Text>Fish tacos were soooooo good. The Smokey flavor and the orange topping really surprised me. Never had a fish taco this good before. Fries seasoning wasn't that well spread out but it was still very good. I've had Wahoo's and slapfish but this takes the fish taco cake!<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

The reason why it's 3 stars is because it's more or less self serve.  No waiters or waitresses

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The tacos the fish was burned I think it was reheated fish and it packs 32 dollars. It's a shame to lucar that's why it's not always good.

<Text>I am definitely a repeat customer, thanks to Omar. In 2018, he helped me get a GREAT deal on prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses. Because of my first experience I have recommended family members as well. I visited again today, hoping to get my sunglasses fixed even with an expired warranty. Crystal gave a warm welcome explained my issue with the Manager, Omar. Thanks to both of them, I walked out with perfect sunglasses, a great deal, and extremely happy about the whole experience. Exceeded my expectations once again. I am so grateful! I will be back for sure.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1617895794062, 'text': 'Hello Feca,\n\nThanks for your kind words!

First time coming to Stanton Optical in Merced and I had a such a great experience! Everyone was so welcoming and made the experience fun. They had a wide selection of different frames to choose from! Gaby was amazing, she was super helpful in suggesting frame styles and made the process feel easy. Thank you for helping me find the perfect pair!< /Text>

<Review>I haven’t been to the eye doctor in about 10 years. Decided to finally go today and I’m glad I did! Everyone at Stanton were so nice! Omar and Crystal were there to help me today and I couldn’t have asked for better experience. Thank you to the both of you for helping me get my glasses and for the excellent service! If you’re thinking about going into Stanton Optical for some glasses but you’re not sure, this is me telling you to go! You’ll find nothing but friendly staff and wonderful service. Thank you again to Omar and Crystal!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great service from Gaby who helped my mom get her eye exam and two new pairs of glasses with their deal. Staff was friendly and Spanish speaking staff was a plus. Covid precautions helped everyone feel safe. Will definitely be coming here again for my mom.< /review>

<username>Prisca M</username><Review>First time coming in to Stanton Optical and the experience was great! I was a little nervous at first, but Crystal made me feel comfortable and at ease. I was then assisted by Omar who kindly explained my prescription and the pricing. They have lots of frames to choose from and really great prices, even if you don't have insurance. Both Crystal and Omar were phenomenal and I will be recommending this place to friends and family! Thank you to the Merced Stanton Optical team for making this an amazing experience.</Review></record>

Omar was my employee who helped me understand my insurance. He also was fast and courteous about where to look at glasses while he worked out my paperwork. My time there was enjoyable because we got to chatting about insurance carriers and glasses manufacturers. All in all he was a pleasure to work with, and I recommend coming to Stanton in Merced if you want glasses. Thank again Omar!

Yesenia was my employee who helped me when picking up my glasses. She was kind and very helpful when it came to my sunglasses choice via the special one time offer when picking up an order . I was told when to come back and pick them up, as well as given the direct line to call in for questions or concerns. She was an amazing person to get to meet. Thanks again Yesenia!<//review>

My daughter just got out of her eye exam and we were helped by the very awesome, knowledgeable, and friendly Omar. He was very professional and guided us through the hundreds of glasses to choose from. Our eye exam went well and after the exam Omar helped us check out and gave us the prescription. Over all a good experience and highly recommended. Thank you Omar!< /Review>

Sub par customer service. It was my first time needing service and it will be my last. Too many people waiting not enough workers. I was approached and told one thing of the services I needed, then after waiting and waiting was told by another employees something total different. Everyone had different procedures and no one knew what was right. Staff need training.</text>

I very much appreciated how attentive the staff was! Also, they made sure to be safe and compliant with covid safety! Very good experience:)<//Review>

< review>
Such great , friendly  and  very time efficient staff. made my significant other and myself feel comfortable and welcome. By the way this was our first time coming to this office .. when we Went into the office it wasn’t very busy but as time went on it got very busy for them but they still managed to get to us in a timely manner and also let us take our time on picking out our frames. By the way we were walk-in’s and the way they handled the customer’s with appointments and non-appointment customer’s were phenomenal. Also them following covid policies that were implemented by their higher up’s was not an issue they were being safe , clean and keeping they’re distance while still being very attentive to their customer’s. Will recommend friend’s/ family here.< /review>

5 stars to these hard workers! Although they’re extremely overbooked For a small location and not many workers they still made us feel safe with the temp checks. All three of the workers had great personalities and super friendly! I don’t leave reviews but the girl asked me how my experience was and to leave a review if I had time and  to be honest they deserve the review!<//review>

<review>Marilyn, the manager, was very accommodating despite of being busy.  She was understanding and considerate of our needs, polite and professional.  We appreciate your being there at Stanton.  Omar was helpful as well.
We have been back almost yearly last several year since they opened in Merced, CA.
The offer of the free and CONVENIENT eye exams since the shop opened makes us return over and over again to them for our eyeglasses needs!< /review>< Pictures>

I came in to get an eye exam and get some glasses since I’ve been needed some for a while. Right when I walked in Marilyn was so helpful and showing what glasses they had and what deals were going on. All the employees were very nice and helpful. I recommend everyone to come here and get glasses. For sure coming back again if I need a new pair.< /Review>

<review>I had a great experience with Stanton Optical in Merced! I was helped by two wonderful ladies named Yesenia and Marilyn the 2nd of March, 2021😊 They made sure that I got exactly what I was looking for at a price that was hard to beat. For those who are concerned, this store holds its COVID-19 protocols to a high standard, it’s very safe and clean ! Definitely recommend anyone in search for a new pair of glasses to attend this location. Hours are posted on their website, they are open despite public belief, I recall someone in the store mentioning that people have been thinking they were closed due to Covid, but they aren’t 😊✨< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Friendly approach and made me feel very welcomed, and comfortable during this tough time during Covid. They do thermometer checks as soon as you walk in and they disinfect after every customers leaves the desk area. I was helped by one of the girls and she had great customer service!

<Review>Most people take the time to leave a bad review when service is bad, or feel the need to only leave a good one when it benefits them in some way. I have nothing but good things to say about the service i recieved the other day from Marilyn. She went above and beyond for me. I was having a bad day as it was and then issues with my insurace coverage, and finding the right frames. I was ready to give up and wait another month in order to afford the ones i wanted. She took the time to identify my needs and located my previous frames that i absoutely loved just lost them. She is an awesome person and i would recommend everyone to seek her out when visiting this location!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1611713707546, 'text': 'Hello Page,\n\nThank you for this nice review!

<text>Customer service was great and staff was very polite and friendly. The only issue is I have been waiting basically a month for my glasses.

All I wanted was an eye exam and a pair of trial contacts to keep for the $89. I mentioned this many times; however, I was charged $50 extra for a lens fitting fee. I never asked for this. They made it sound like I needed to have this along with order contacts from them in order to get a discount. The discount comes in the form of waiving the $50 lens fitting fee when I order the contacts. The contacts cost $91 for a pack of 12- as high as twice as much as anyone else online. It's scammy at best. This company is all about their bottom line. Merced doesn't really have any options and the people going there don't know any better<//text>

I’ve been to several optical centers, and each one gave me the repetitive lack of care and eye rolls that left me to believe these businesses just want to take your money and send you on your way.

Stanton Optical in Merced rejuvenated my faith in customer service and gave me the attention I hope to receive in any establishment . I didn’t know what I necessarily wanted in terms of style and vision, and they graciously held my hand and walked me through the entirety of the transaction. By far the best experience I could ask for and came out with the utmost content for my glasses.

Even though my family that I was with came in a little loud, and my nephew couldn’t seem to sit still, they took care of us without judgement.
I will continue to keep coming here along with the abundance of referrals to all who admire a group of associates that care for your needs, and will meet all of them with customer satisfaction.

Thank you again!<//text>

Today I walked in to ask a few questions about prices times and dates to compare to other places...I LITERALLY walked out no more then 2 hours later with TWO pairs of glasses with my new prescription! I was completely not expecting that AT ALL. Great service, so many choices, and to have walked out with 2 new pair of glasses after not having mine for years cause I been dreading the waiting process for appointment and getting a pair of glasses at my old office is simply amazing!  I am definitely going back for some sunglasses. I am just so happy! Day absolutely made! Thank You!<//text>

I went in to Stanton after my insurance changed to see if I could get a better deal there than at my regular optometrist. I was happy to see they took care credit. They have a large selection of different priced glasses, they do the exam in the store, and they make your glasses in store too. I went in, picked out 2 pairs of glasses, got my eye exam and was able to pick up my glasses the next day. I ended paying less all together at Stanton then I would have for one pair of glasses at my optometrist. Plus I got my glasses faster. The staff was very kind and helpful. I will recommend them to all of my family and friends.<//Review>

Eye Exams are NOT free, as advertised. Exam price is "included," with the purchase of glasses (at full price).<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><gmap_id>0x809143b3b38469eb:0x60c5f341440588b2</gmap_id><user_name>Alejandro Lopez</user_name>< time>

<Text>Went to Stanto Optical, personel were very nice
But it was during Covid19 so my actual  examination was through a tv.  When my glasses
Came in the priscription was not enough. Just about the same as my old priscription that was 3 yrs old.  They redid the examination the same
Way. This time it took a month to get my glasses.  Priscription did not change much. It was a no line bifocal and the bottom part was so fuzzy it could not read with them. But I needed
My glasses to drive so I just took them as they were. And I told the girl that. During my 3 visits
there I saw a few other people bringing their glasses back cause their prescriptions were wrong.  I will probably go some where else next time. The staff were very polite though.
This was the Merced location on Olive.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

If I could give Negative points I would.  This is the third week and I still don’t have my glasses.  I had an exam via video conference.  I WILL NEVER USR THEM AGAIN...   I can’t see anything.  All I got, when calling them was, “I will let you know when they come in”.  If you are considering them for your Optical needs, please re consider.  I have used Costco in the past and my wife has used an optician in Riverbank, very satisfied with them.   Stanton Optical is not customer focused, they are all about the $$$.  Never again</Text>

Today I went in to look for the perfect pair of glasses, I found so many pairs to choose from that it became overwhelming but Marilyn came right over and made me feel so comfortable and welcome. She helped me find my perfect pair of glasses she was so sweet and made it such a fast and easy experience. I would definitely refer all my family and friends to Stanton optical it was a great experience!< /review>

<Review>Omar was awesome! I thought my insurance only paid for the exam and he called them to double check and ended up saving me about $600. I had a bad experience at the Fresno store and Omar totally redeemed Stanton Optical for me.< /Review>< date>

<review>Love this place. Everyone was very helpful and kind. Wasn't able to find frames that I liked but they were able to replace the lens in the frames I was already wearing. Was quick and easy!

The staff was amazing and very knowledgeable in pairing various frames with face shape and facial features in a flattering way. I was able to schedule an appointment and be seen short notice. They found the most affordable and valuable options for my needs. I feel like I got the most bang for my buck. Would recommend to anyone.</review>

Bought a pair of sunglasses that the frame broke. Took them back for the warranty and even though they only have one wrapped frame, they couldn't get a replacement. Customer service was horrible, mind as well call McDonald's for help. Clueless service won't step foot in there again.< /Text>

<Text>This place is amazing!! I had debated for so long to come into a new optical location because I had been using the same Optometrist office since middle schoo!! But I am so happy I gave it a try!! I loved how many different glasses designs they had in the office & the best part was there deals!! I was assisted by a very warm and welcoming sales person by the name of Marilyn who I later found out was the assistant sales manager!! She was so helpful in helping me thru a free eye exam as well as patiently waiting and assisting me in finding the perfect glasses!! She helped me through the whole process until check out!! I didn’t think I would receive the same individual attention from a corporate office but I was proven wrong!! They went above n beyond my expectations!! Highly recommend for everyone, I’m even taking my dad in next time!!< /Text>< Pics>

I spent a good hour and a half by choice just looking through their wide selection of frames. I absolutely enjoyed my time and walked out with a big smile on my face. The eye exam was a little different than what I'm used to. It was done through a video call and the machine was operated remotely which was pretty awesome. Gabby, Omar, and Jackie are all really friendly staff that assisted me through the whole process. I felt very comfortable in their hands. They had great deals going so I took advantage of the offers and made some really aweso e purchases.< /text>

<Review>Best experience at an eye placen ever.  The store is brand new and clean.  The system they use to check your eye sight is good technology.  They have a pretty big selection of glasses seen around town.  They were busy when I got there but the waiting wasn't bad and really friendly staff took my insurance.</Review></record>

The customer service was really great: fast and friendly.  I came in with my glasses taped together.  With an hour I had an eye exam and left with two pairs of glasses with prescription lenses.  The prices are reasonable, and they have a great selection of frames.<//Text>

When I first purchased my kids glasses at Stanton the staff was helpful and the deal I thought I was getting was great. Should of known it was to good to be true. I went to take one of my child's glasses in to get fixed and was told I had to pay for all new lenses and frames because they don't due repairs, but that they would give me 20 percent off the new pair. I laughed, the deal that I was sold stated that frames and lenses were covered 100 percent. Ended up walking out with my child's broken glasses and a lesson learned, don't do business with Stanton over priced and fake warranties, should of went to Costco's vision center instead.< /text>

<time>1596155662409</time><rate>5< /rate><Text>Went in today to get an eye exam. Came out with a brand new pair in less than 2 hours. Really friendly staff, super helpful and, as they put it "We look out for our students". Would highly reccommend.

Update 1: Just over a year later. I had a great experience with them, so I decided to return. I got the same staff, and each one was just as friendly as the last time I went in. I was thinking about getting contacts, and they were all extremely helpful and patient with me.

After talking with the doctor administering my exam, I had explained to him my skepticisms with contacts. He clearly and honestly talked me through each question I had. When it came time to try on pairs of contacts, he was again very friendly, patient and funny.

I wanted to try on some colored contacts, but was skeptical of how they looked on me. I asked him for his honest opinion, and then he even went as far as to take me around to the rest of the staff to get their opinions (with my consent, of course).

Again, these are very good, patient and honest people that helped me out to get great contacts at the cheapest available price to me. I am very grateful of this, as Merced has proven to not be very caring of its student population. I hope to return again if need be.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>I definetly recomend this place, I went there to FINALLY get a pair of glasses. I have been without glasses for years (only contacts). I just did a walk in and got my eye exam right away. Then after the exam I was able to choose my glasses and one of the employees named Marilyn was soo sweet and helped me find the perfect glasses, I am extremely picky so she helped soo much. She did my fitting and told me my glasses would be done within the hour.  And I was out of there. Only took an hour so that's not bad at all.
I am definently going back there when it's time for my next pair😊</Text>< Pictures>

They made me feel comfortable in relaxed. I didnt know my glasses was going to be $276 since i did went in there for the promotion they did have going on but beacuse of how bad my eye sight was i knew it was to good to be true.

<Review>We had the most horrible experience with this business. After spending $200 plus we feel we have been taken. I ordered 2 pairs. One distance and one sunglasses. My husband ordered one pair of bifocals. My glasses came in the completely wrong frames. My husbands bifocals had a thin strip for the bottom part of the lens. He was unable to read at all. After 3 weeks his lens fell out and one of the arms broke.
We live 65 miles from this store and because we could not get in before a month basically we were out of luck. The customer service was dreadful. The workers had no idea what they were doing. Please save your money and don't shop at Stanton Merced!< /Review>< Resp>

<Review>I wish I could leave a NEGATIVE star. I called DAYS in advance and gave all of my information and was scheduled for an appointment. Rearranged my whole schedule only to walk in and have them smuggly tell me they do not take my insurance and then smirk in my face as I walked out.

The staff over here at the merced Stanton optical treated us amazing.  We came in and were in a rush (granted this is not the type of deal you should normally rush) . Hot day outside, the place is nice, ac cool. The entire staff was very knowledgeable and courteous.  We got an excellent deal, paid a slight bit more for higher quality.  We were done and out of there in just a little over an hour.. that was including a detailed eye exam,  two pairs of quality glasses made, and a precise prescription ( doctor was very good in getting a precise prescription made out while dealing with my being anxious. )  Big thank you to the entire staff at merced Stanton optical.  Money spent as best as can be.</text>

I drove here with my mom to go up to merced college to get some glasses. The people there assured us it would be a fast and quick process due to the fact my mom had to work all the way back in los banos in an hour or two. As you all can guess 30minutes turned into an hour, and I felt like the doctor had no patiences and rushed through my exam.
We had left late and the entire experience i had felt off so i called wanting to just cancel my order. I was told i couldnt because i would then have to pay 95$ just for the doctors time. Okay, no biggie guess i will just have to find a way to get there with my busy schedule.
Fast forward to the glasses being ready and about a month later, me and my friend go. I walk in get my glasses only to realize they got my perscription wrong. It was wayyyy too strong and gave me a migrane right off the bat. I had no problems in the refund process other than it took rather long, and not to mention that the whole "the only recheck exams we have are on fridays" which wouldnt work for someone who works in the restaurant industry. The only reason I am giving it one star is because the general manager and staff were nice.<//text>

Great fast, customer service! Especially Omar, the sales manager. Even though Stanton wasn't in my insurance network, Omar  still chose to match with the in-network rates, so I still ended with the regular in-network copay prices.  I got my glasses within 30mins!  I recommend them, especially if you're a UC Merced student!</Text>

Marilyn, Lorena, and Gabby really helped me out with over the top customer service. They got the glasses I need and did whatever they could to get a price I could afford.

The worse place ever. We were not even told that there would not be an actual optometrist at the office. The Dr. was doing the appointments remotely from the computer.  I was not even given a receipt for the exam I was charged due to having insurance. We waited for 2 hours after our appointment time and were still not called back. So we got up to leave. When I said we were leaving the girl at the counter got defensive and called a Mgr.  He refunded my exam fee and thanked me for not getting loud/irrate with the staff, so I'm sure they are use to customers walking out. Definatly would not recommend this place.<//text>

<review>My first time even dealing with glasses so i asked around &ended up going for the 2 for 69.99 deal (I'm a big bargainer) but then Omar the man who helped me told me about the buy one get 1 free deal .? I was a little on hold knowing i was going to spend more than tripple what I planned to spend but I was easily persuaded after he told me he would work with me to make sure I can get the best price possible.... And after seeing ALL the beautiful frames of course (uhgg sooo cute) lol ..after trying on a couple he rang me up and I was more than happy with my price ...I have to wait  a couple weeks for them but I'm very excited about my first pair of glasses ...Id recommended this place to anyone  Thank you Omar and Stanton Optical for the deal & Great costumer service.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They should not have waisted my time. I called to make an appointment and I asked them. Do I have to buy anything and they said no. I go in and first thing they tell me is that to give me the promotion price I had to buy contacts there as well.  I walked out right away.<//Review>

First off, its not filled with sand or wood chips, its all leaves. The jungle gym is literally a jungle with all the bird poop and spider webs. And on top of all that, there is a GIANT FCC BROADCASTING TOWER disguised as a tree. Right next to the park. I stood 3 feet from the tower as i read a sign that said "this tower produces more radio frequency than is allowed for the public. Caution". Close it down please.

< review>
John Calderon and his apprentice came to my rescue today! After a string of bad experiences with plumbers who were recommended to me or referred by my home warranty, I decided to venture out and find my own. Anderson Plumbing was the first to pop up and had the highest rating in San Diego. When I called, they answered immediately (last plumber hung up on me) and had someone at my door WITHIN AN HOUR (last plumber waited seven days before coming to my condo). John was so knowledgeable and friendly. (Both of them showed my dog lots of love, so bonus points there.) He was able to diagnose the problem immediately and even showed me the exact issue (so I knew he wasn’t just trying get me to replace a bunch of parts to drive up the cost). Although the fix was pricey, he was upfront about the cost and talked me through my options. They had the parts on hand to fix the water heater and waited until the hot water was running throughout the house before they left. Although larger companies can be a bit more expensive, it was 100% worth the extra money to use a reputable, legit company who came to my aid immediately and had a mini warehouse in their truck with everything they needed to fix the problem. Paying a couple extra bucks was worth avoiding the hassle I’ve been experiencing with 2-star rated companies who took a week to get here in the first place. John converted me to a loyal customer and I will only use Anderson Plumbing in the future. Also - John spoke volumes about the owners of the company and how generous they are with their employees and are wonderful people to work for — that’s the exact type of company I want to support!!</review>

You can trust them to listen, perform the repairs with professionalism, good humor and friendliness.

I received a text before Rudy Vasquez came out.  A very pleasant text message identifying who was coming and provided a brief bio of Rudy.  This made a world of difference to me!  We are off to a great start, and it kept getting better and better!

Anderson Plumbing is on my speed dial and will be out go to for all of our plumbing needs!

Great job, extremely pleased!<//Review>

<review>Gated valve failed on main irrigation valve. Digging required. First estimate came in at 535 for digging and replacement with 1/4 turn ball valve or plastic. Anderson came in at over 1500 for the same repair. I verified that it was the same exact repair. How can the same job cost $1000 more? It wasn't an emergency fix. How can prices vary so widely? Unbelievable. I guess OK in an emergency, but a grand more for a valve replacement? Are these industries regulated on prices? Seems like a free for all in the trades as far as prices. Just unreal.</review>< pictures>

Highly recommend Anderson for their excellent service, professionalism, and extremely competitive pricing. The repair tech was  here right on time, explained the situation completely, offered a few maintenance suggestions and put everything back in place when he was done. Will definitely use their services if/when the need arises.< /Review>

Re pipe of the gas system in my mobile home.
Drew, the technician did a great job replacing my old gas piping, risers and shutoffs.

The furnace, water heater are performing well.

The stove is not working at this time. I’m not sure what happened there?

Thank You Drew!< /review>

We've used Anderson's before with good results.  This time they sent a self-professed "drain" guy to install a new kitchen faucet on a Friday.  On Saturday, we discovered a large leak under the sink.  I called customer service and the first answer was "we like to have the responsible installer do the repair, is that alright?"  Uh, no, what part of large leak don't you understand?  Turned out the earliest they could get anyone out was Monday!  All weekend appointments were "booked".  As a VIP member I expected better service than this when the leak was caused by their installer.
The gentleman who came on Monday initially intended to charge me for the visit, but backed off when I explained (again) who had caused the issue.  He was competent and knowledgeable and fixed the problem to our satisfaction, but I still contend that I shouldn't have had to spend the weekend with a leak that was caused by their employee.  And next time, if there is a next time, please don't send a DRAIN guy to do a PLUMBER'S job. I also told the dispatcher to have a Supervisor call me on Monday to discuss (no supervisor available on weekend).  That never happened.  This is not what I call VIP service.

Edited based on the prompt response I received from Erin in CS. She took responsibility,  both personally and as a company, for the issues I identified and resolved the situation to my satisfaction.< /Review>

I wanted to do an update on my 5 star review. Change it to 1 star as I was charged 202 bucks to relight my water heater. I figured it was standard for the business but was shocked to learn was way overcharged. I was not present at the time. My girlfriend was and she definitely was taken advantage of. She was just happy to have hot water. Then I was given an estimate to replace a 2 year old water heater and they wanted 3300 bucks. You can get water heater for about 650 to 750 at home depot and get it installed for 200 bucks. This company really does wow with sticker price. Shocking. They did say they would apply the 202 towards install. Wow. Definitely do your research.</Text>

<Text>We have preferred service for the tankless water heater and scheduled for service today. Service technician arrive 3 1/2 hours after agreed upon time.
The water pressure was checked and read 150 psi which is above the serviceable psi of 50(?). Technician quoted a price of $745!! To replace a regulator that cost less than $100?!  There is an adjustment screw that reduces the psi and could have been done or at least recommended versus a $745 replacement. Extremely poor customer service after waiting for hours for technician to arrive. Not a pleased customer whatsoever. There motto of making you smile is not today rather the opposite.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great service. Fernando and his helper were very professional. Quality and fast install of new water heater. They also installed a water regulator for the irrigation system.

I would have given 5 stars - except the price was very high in comparison. Especially that we plumbed the whole house with copper before. Anderson did the work ...</review>

You can always count on Anderson PHA to do the job correctly the first time. Our technician, Dave, performed the annual inspection and servicing of our recently installed furnace. At the end, he provided a detailed report of the tests and measurements he performed. He took the extra time to answer all of my questions and even repaired a leak on the hot water vent on my roof. Just like all other Anderson employees, Dave left the area cleaner than he found it. I joined the Anderson VIP program and found it to be financially beneficial in keeping my furnace, hot water heater, and plumbing in good working order.< /text>

While the initial inspection went great and was conducted in a professional manner, the quote received for a new heat pump and air handler were among the highest we saw from any vendor.

However, the rating given takes into account Anderson's incessant marketing emails that I swear I've unsubscribed from multiple times and still receive. Marking them as spam hasn't worked either for some reason.<//Review>

<text>Jamar did a fantastic job. Very knowledgeable, skilled, and polite. Jamar explained everything to me with potential options so could make a decision on the course of action to replace the water heater. He let me know the steps he would take to do the job and did exactly that. Well done Jamar. Thank you.<//text>< pics>

<text>Repaired Shower Faucet.
I was led to believe it would be a more extensive job to replace a standard Moen valve (with a plastic handle)."Once I open up the wall it could take a while(paraphrasing)." Over $500 and 30minutes later he was out the door. Appalled, I dug a little deeper. Apparently, it's a very common valve and easy to fix, based on results. Of course, I called to complain several times and never received a callback. I did receive an email stating their policy and they would extend courtesy with a $126 discount. So the result is 1 valve $50 and 30 minute labor $324.  ***Buyer Beware< /text>< rating>

<text>Overall, the service was good. The only discrepancies were that the Free HVAC Sanitizing Service mentioned on the mailer reminding me that it’s time for your VIP HVAC TUNE UP did not specify that I had to mention that I wanted the free sanitizing service in order to get it done with the tune up. Now I have to schedule another appointment to get the Sanitizing Service. It would of been a lot more convenient to get it done in one appointment. Last, the technicians used my garden hose and got it all muddy. It would of been nice if they could of swept the mud off the hose!</text>< Time>

We reached out to many plumbing companies but Anderson had the best price. The technician Drew was amazing and patient with us. He came masked up and listened to all our concerns. Drew replaced our tankless hot water heater within 4hrs. Drew was polite, friendly and quick. They even gave us a military discount.

Thank you Anderson for sending Drew Grant! Yayyyy! We have hot water again. 😊

<Rate>1</Rate><review>While "Katy" was very professional in her demeanor and seems highly versed in the technical aspects of my furnace, I was surprised by the lack of specificity in the diagnoses. It could be this, this or this.  Which leads me to question, do service tech earn commission on repairs? In other words, the more parts and labor they sell, the bigger their paycheck?

Is this ethical?  Sadly, I ran into this same issue about a year or two ago with Anderson and my AC condenser. The repair estimate was $6K.  I ended up fixing it myself for $200 and it's worked perfectly ever since.

Today’s repair estimate  $1,788 + $68 for the service call. The parts, which I found online, are less than $285, and I question if they are both necessary. Labor time to replace these two suggested parts, or three suggested parts is 45 minutes for an experienced tech,  double for a novice.

With this second instance of what I believe are questionable at best business practices, and more likely unethical ones, obviously supported by management I will not use your company for any service or future sales.

UPDATE - March 2021
Apparently my review struck a nerve. Received a call and a full refund of my $68 service call fee. I still feel it’s a buyer beware situation, but I acknowledge the company did the right thing when they were called out.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I was frazzled when my brand new laundry machine began leaking. After the Maytag people came and stated I required a plumber I frantically began calling all the local plumbers. Anderson Plumbing answered quickly,  made sure I would get a quick time frame, fixed the issue and made sure I was satisfied! I will be utilizing their company again!<//Text>

All of my interactions with Anderson were phenomenal from calling the main line to meeting the technicians. We had a surprise leak that turned into bigger issues at every turn due to water damage- they assisted during each step and even were able to coordinate with the restoration company to help us get things fixed. James & Drew were amazing technicians- both friendly, on-time and knowledgeable. I appreciate all the advice, hard work and communication. Thanks, Anderson!</Text>

Despite my reluctance to deal with a huge plumbing service, I requested a plumber from Anderson to come out and evaluate why my bathroom sink drain continues to clog only 1-2 months after having it cleaned out. I was clear when booking the appointment that I did not want an 'unclog' service but for an actual plumber to come assess my issue.

Afternoon appointments are supposed to be from 12-4pm but the technician did not arrive until 5pm. When she arrived I explained what I was looking to do, just as I had explained it to the dispatcher. I proceeded to show her the issue and she removed the drawers from my bathroom sink in order to look at the plumbing.

After looking at the plumbing she indicated that she could clear the clog but it would happen again due to the drain. I explained that the purpose of the service call was to evaluate and take the steps needed to permanently resolve the issue and I was happy to replace all plumbing if needed to resolve this issue.

She continued to recommend that I have her fix the issue so the drain flows for ~$150, and have someone else come look at the drain with a camera. When I explained that I didn't want to spend $150 on a temporary fix when I was going to pay to replace the plumbing, the technician gave me attitude and left without reinstalling the drawers into my sink cabinet.

It has been difficult to get ahold of anyone at Anderson to resolve the issue. I have requested my money back and will use a different plumber to complete my project.<//Text>

Replaced a smart thermostat from an older model. I provided thermostat. No extra wiring dine. Took tech about 10 minutes start to finish. Cost $291 and they did not connect to my router. Unable to use feature on smart thermostat. I guess i did get wowwed! Price versus what was actually done. I emailed Anderson Plumbing and i will wait to hear back. I wonder how much it would cost to have the thermostat to work as a smart device. WOW

<text>We had Anderson come out and do a complimentary cleaning on our furnace. We were told we needed thousands of dollars in cleaning, repair, and upgrades to bring it up to code. We had a second opinion without mentioning any of the issues brought up by Anderson from another reputable company. They only quoted us one part to bring the unit up to code and it was a fraction of the price. We won’t be using Anderson again because of the prices and unnecessary services offered each time.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I became a member of the VIP program and had a technician at my place to check my furnace today. He was very professional and concerned with my home’s cleanliness. He did a thorough job and now I have peace of mind regarding this important part of my home.< /Review>

Bernard replaced wall heater thermostat. Before entering our residence he put on booties over his shoes. Comprehensive  check of wall heater.  Discussed the Lifespan of heater and the importance of CO detectors. Added a little chemistry lesson. Gas is lighter than oxygen so the detector needs to be mounted high.</text>

Anderson plumbing returned my inquiry within 15 minutes and a professional technician arrived promptly at the agreed time.  Barzan was professional and efficient in clearing our clogged bathroom sinks.  Highly recommend Barzan and Anderson Plumbing.  Thank you!< /Review>

I truly appreciated their workmanship and knowledge.  My thing is when you're refinished with the job and you leave it cleaner than what it was when you started, that speaks volumes for the company they represent! Thats why I'll be a returning customer!... and i just happen to be doing some remodeling hmmmm.</Review>< pictures>

Mike was fantastic. We had a water heater flooding the garage (after hours) Mike came here when he finished a job, turned off water heater but made sure we had wagon house. He was here promptly next morning & installed new heater. STRONGLY recommend Anderson plumbing, everyone from dispatcher to Mike were extremely helpful & professional.<//text>

I have used Andersen Heating and Air for 8 years. They took out an old gas wall heater, dry walled to perfection and painted the area; they installed & have maintenanced the mini split ductless units, they have installed a new water heater, a new garbage disposal, cleared a slow drain. Their service is top notch, and the technicians are competent, friendly, and leave the place clean. I highly recommend.< /Text>

Wonderful from start to finish! The company called 30mins before to let me know when they would arrive! They also texted a picture of the man coming to fix my shower! When he arrived he had a clean mask on an put booties over his shoes as he walked into my house! He was good with my dogs. He did a very good inspection of my shower wall and found the leek behind the broken handle! He gave me options on fixing it with different prices so I could make the best decision!! Super professional and I will use them again!</text>

I received a call from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air to advise me that I was due for my annual, no cost, service on my two heaters that Anderson had installed 4 years prior.  They indicated they had a technician that could perform the service the following day.

The HVAC Maintenance Technician, Haley Wegman, called the following day to say she'd be arriving within the half hour.  She was on time--we're off to a good start.

She inspected both of our heaters and provided an easy to follow assessment of what she'd found and done.  Haley was very professional, reassuring and a pleasure to work with.  Anderson has done an excellent job with recognizing the unique talents that military vets, like Haley, possess.  If I were to rate my satisfaction with Anderson and Haley on a 10 point scale, they would receive an 11.</Review>

<Review>Micheal was very nice and checked all areas for a leak. He didn’t locate the leak in my toilet and referred me to advanced detection who found the toilet valve was leaking. I think Anderson should have found and repaired the leak before I had to pay $240 to have the tank cover lifted to reveal the slow leak. Now I have to pay for another visit by Anderson to make the repairs. This is an expensive mistake by Anderson< /Review><gmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//gmapID>< rate>

My plumbing technician was phenomenal.  I was worried about the repair.  She fixed it quickly and efficiently.  She fixed it at a reasonable cost, and was extremely personable!   I’ve used Andersen before and was just as pleased.   I recommend Andersen Plumbing and specifically Kristina for any plumbing issues!<//Text>

<review>Mike arrived at the scheduled time and was very informative and outright with the explanation of the issue, he showed me the problem area and also gave me insight into the level of carbon monoxide being caused by the issue! His knowledge on the subject and safety advice is very much appreciated! Unfortunately I cannot resolve the issue as quickly as I’d like the information he gave me will ensure I make the right choice when the time comes!

He goes above and beyond a 5☆ service. He gets the job done right the first time!

<Review>As part of Anderson’s comprehensive home maintenance program, I was delighted to have them call and schedule a checkup of my water heater. This is part of their service after the sale that helps to set Anderson apart from the others.
The technician came by on schedule and Preventively serviced my water Heater and explained how to help it last as long as possible.  Offered No pressure to make any Upgrades but gave me options to consider if we wanted to improve our water quality.
I think I made an excellent decision to go with Anderson when we installed our AC system. I’m confident they will take care of us for years to come.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I Just wanted to let you know that the service technician you sent,  Michael Gaskill, did an excellent job for me on my A/C system. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable and diagnosed and got the deferred maintenance and repairs accomplished all in one appointment. He even spotted and corrected some prior installation defects from the original installer and cleaned my permanent air filter in the unit for me! I would not hesitate to have Michael perform heating and cooling repairs for me at my home in the future.

<rating>5</rating><review>I wish I could give Jacob and Humberto 10 stars instead of five!  I had a gigantic hot water leak in the slab of my home and called Anderson Plumbing to check it out.  After hearing a wide range of repair options and learning about the benefits of repiping the water system through the attic (no future slab leaks and no tearing up the floor!), I decide to go for the whole home repipe.  Jacob and Humberto started work the next morning and completed the pipe fitting within three days.  I was blown away by the quality, speed, accuracy and cleanliness of their work.  They communicated well with me, each other, and their main office so there were zero hiccups.  A huge bonus was that we had running, cold water and at least one restroom available at all times, until the last three hours when the system changed from old pipes to new.  A VERY well ran project and professional company from start to finish!  Please don’t hesitate to call Anderson...or have your home repiped by them!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Anderson Plumbing helped us with a last minute issue. In having our floors replaced we needed a plumber to check for leaks as our concrete subfloors had some moisture on them. We got very quick appointment with Anderson Plumbing and Joshua showed up the next morning, early and checked everything for us thoroughly. It was quite a relief to have someone come out with such short notice and still be very thorough and not cut any corners! Thank you guys so much!< /Review><Time>1604681356406< /Time><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

First time customer and will use again.  Always saw their commercials and received flyer on specials (yes, they work).  Had a leak in kitchen clean out and James came out same day.  He explained the problem, gave me options and then proceeded to work.  About 20 mins later work was done and price was reasonable.  Wonder why I waited so long?

First off, our technician that showed Josue was not only the most professional, but also timely plumber I’ve used in a while. He was incredibly courteous and mindful of our very expensive tile throughout the bathroom where he had to unclog a drain.

I can’t speak so much about the company as I’d like to comment on how amazing our technician Josue was. If we could give six stars we would, Andersen is fortunate to have someone like this on their team.<//text>

Update:
Erin, Anderson's Client Relations Manager reached out via email and explained their policy of flat rate per type of the job.  She offered 15% off on the water pressure regulator job and removed the charge for accessing the valve. While I recognize the effort to provide good customer care (along with multiple text, email and phone call asking for feedback)  I cannot say I'm remotely happy about this flat rate charge that's 3-4 time higher than being reasonable.

===========================================================
Anderson Plumbing's charge is absurdly high! I had a technician come to fix a leaky waterline going into the fridge. while doing that he also found the water pressure was high and I agreed to have the water pressure regulator replaced.

He had to cut a small hole on the drywall to access the pipe, which took him 30 seconds, and the charge is $323. Note this is only for cutting the hole, not including any repair work, and they will not fix the drywall afterwards. The actual repair work of replacing the water supply line's connection valve is another $323, which I'm ok with, since at least the technician spent 30 minutes on it.

The most ridiculous one is the $1,485 charge for replacing the water pressure regulator. The part is $180 according to the technician, and it's a quick job taking him literally less than 10 minutes using only a plumbers plier. I found out afterwards a reasonable cost for this should be in the $300 range including the part, and feel quite bad not doing enough research and being an informed customer beforehand. I wish everyone else considering calling them have the chance to read the reviews beforehand and be aware of their practice of overcharging to an outrageous extent.

I do agree that it was easy for me to make the appointment, and the technician came on time and finished the job quickly in a professional manner. But I'd not be able to recommend their services to anyone due to the extremely unreasonably high cost.<//review>

I called on a Friday night after we showed our condo all day and came home to find the thermostat off and not responding to the usual reset circuit breaker, etc. Joselito was out to our house quickly and had the electrical issue fixed in less than an hour. The cost was very reasonable and the service was excellent.</text>

Just a short note to give many thanks to Brian Blanchard from Anderson Plumbing who came to my home for a second (actually third) opinion on a sewage pipe design. Brian is very knowledgeable and came up with a solution two other plumbers (from a competing company) weren't able to figure out. Highly recommend Brian! Again many, many thanks!< /review>

I was really wowed , Ken was so kind, helpful, professional, informative. Knowledgeable and went above and beyond to fix and repair,
He repaired a shower diverter that the original contractor i hired messed up. He was so respectful and didn't wanna step in the shower to keep it clean
Then I asked to replace a kitchen faucet so he took care of it although he had to cut the rusty part and also fixed all the plumbing mistakes originally was made by some bad plumer, that  eventually ended in my dishwasher working again after I was about to buy a new one.
I can't say enough about Ken, he cared about my house like its his<//text>

I called to avail their promotion for mini split tune up. Joe was the technician who came to perform the job. He did a thorough inspection of my unit to make sure my filters are clean, the coils are producing much needed cold air, pressure is ok. Keep up the excellent job Joe. He is also very respectful and friendly.< /text>

<Review>Aug 28  rPlumber was great, gave estimate $300+ to pull toilet. Did the work and found a broken flange which he didn't have.Would reschedule for Sat 29..... Sat 29 someone  calls in sick, will schedule Monday fine with us. ...Mon 31 a tech arrives but says he is her to do a complementary  camera inspection of our system.Never said specifically he was their to finish the job....estimate now $660+. We send him off they will reschedule us now for tues Sept 1 Agent for Andersen call us on the phone agent is finally on the way estimate ..$1,500 to finish seating our toilet had her repeat it so my wife could hear $1,500! My wife is handicapped with Parkinsons so the toilet is essential .So after 5days after pulling the toilet and the estimate doubling every time. We definitely felt we were getting burned.The job is not done  we are going elsewhere!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

We had an old water heater that started leaking.  Anderson was able to come first thing the next day to give a free estimate.  We had several companies come out and provide us quotes to replace it with a gas tankless water heater.   Anderson came in at a reasonable price but the technician, Drew (Andrew), included additional incentives that persuaded us to go with them.  Drew had everything with him and was able to get us the appropriate water heater that same day.  He relocated and installed the water heater outside of our garage by the end of the day.   We were impressed by how efficient and clean he was with his work.  We had previous copper plumbing done in our home before and Drew was impressively quicker than the other guys.  He had to come back another day to finish up other work to our house but was equally as efficient and clean with his work.  He also set us up to have our drains scoped for free.  The technician, Brent, came out to scope our drains and was equally efficient, timely, and customer friendly.  I would highly recommend Anderson, Drew, and Brent for future plumbing/heating projects.</text>

Worst ever customer service and plumbing knowledge. We called them for detecting a leak which had resulted in the floor flooding. The plumber came visited the house and charged us for the visit. The plumber had no clue, he could not detect the source and wrongly advised that the leak was coming from the bathroom upstairs. They charged us $365 for nothing and never send us a report. After multiple follow ups still till date no report has been given. We ended up calling another plumber who very quickly detected the leaking dishwasher at almost $100 cheaper. He also help fixed the leak and helped us with drying company and dishwasher company.

I would never use Andersen Plumbing ever again and advise everyone to stay away from them.

Subsequent to this review I had a very good follow up from Andersen and they have since rectified their response and have successfully resolved the matter to my satisfaction.

Thank you Andersen for prompt followup.<//text>

The tech had booties but walked to and from his truck with them on so not sure they helped much. My wife needed to ask the tech to put on a new mask since his wasn’t covering his alface completely- he was nice enough to comply.

He disassembled and took the parts to try and find new ones, saying he would be in touch in a couple of days.  Crickets.

We called 3 times and were told the technician would get back with us soon.  More crickets.

Called again and were told that technician had a "family emergency" and would be in touch when he returned.  More crickets.

Called today, July 31, and was told the technician quit.  He still has our fixture, which I can not now repair as they are an uncommon brand and hard to find.  We have not been able to use the bathroom shower/tub for almost a month.  The manager is "going to look into it" and was supposed to call me today or tomorrow.

Unbelievably unprofessional for the "nobody wows clients like we do" company.</Review><time>1596239796195<//time></record></dataset><record>

I've never used Anderson Plumbing until yesterday. My technician Josh was a plumbing maestro. I had a hard to find leak in an older home and he was able to determine exactly where it was and how to fix it in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, he had to use a jackhammer but I feel very confident his work was done expertly and I will not have any more issues. Moreover, he was professional, present and respectful.<//Text>

Had a leak on my hot water valve under my bathroom sink. The valves were super old and I tried to close the valve which caused the issue. Andrew with Anderson Plumbing showed up within 20 minutes. He replaced both hot and cold valves and was out the door within another 20 minutes. He was very professional through the entire process. I will definitely be calling him back for any more plumbing needs.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I was quoted to replace a 40 gallon water heater at 3990. Of course this must have included a waterless system which I wasn't given both options. My wife had to meet them being I got held up and I'm starting to think maybe a little hoodwink was in place when wifey opened the door cause do the math. 40 gallon brand-new water heater is no more than 600 home depot, search online and find an installer for 200 to 250 tops, now we at 850 and this is a high 850, it could be at least minus 200 from that depending on thriftiness in ones blood. However, of course the water damage was way to extensive for Anderson plumbing so they needed another company one they suggested to come dry out sheet rock in the garage, hehehe. Not sheetrock in the breathing area within the home but off in the garage that was hardly bad, my house fan could dry it up in 5 hours . However, to get all done we were looking at 4000 to 5000. Oh us military have a whopping 3 percent discount , ooohhhh. Just keep that 3 percent and invest into a little moral dignity and remember what it was like when you started out Mrs Andersen, not everyone has la jolla strip mall money, and to be women owned part of a special population you would think they wouldn't try to get over on a wife filling in for husband or 3 percent might actually go to 10 percent for another special population in military and that 5000 is 2 military paychecks just to get water hot, hell I could rent two recruits from mcrd to sit and blow their hot breath on the tank and it be more morally inline than 5000 dollars for 40 gallons of water but wait they were trying to upgrade our whole system cause they must have insider scoop my housing area is turning into a strip mall where 5000 seems bout right when it also has a 24hr fitness inside the mall, ridiculous, .I just paid 75 for a water heater and 250 to install from facebook marketplace, Anderson you ought to be ashamed of the robbery you just attempted .

Have used them before on a clogged sink drain, this time it was the toilet. They give you plenty of time to be ready before a technician arrives. My technician Chris made quick work of the issue and was very professional the entire visit. I will choose Anderson again any time when faced with plumbing related issues.<//Review>

Anderson plumbing heating & Air - came to service my AC - but arrived without a new filter
They installed the entire furnace and AC unit -
In Covid times - it would be nice to be prepared with essential items to avoid entering homes unnecessarily- now they’ll need to come back
Again - Just a waste of their time & mine
The filter was in serious need of replacement..< /Review>

The slogan ‘How can we make your day a little better’ is exactly what u receive.
My heater was wintered checked at no charge, & the service rep Jeff was true to the 5 star service the company represents. Jeff was courteous, friendly, an expert in his field & walked me through the services he was providing, explaining all facets. As a senior citizen I truly appreciated his time & patience with any questions I had.
Thank you Anderson Plumbing, your techs r the best!!!< /Review>

We have had our heater and AC, as well as our water heater, serviced by Anderson for about 15 years now.  Appointments are easy to make and the technicians are professional as well as congenial.  Aldo just serviced our AC.  We bought it from Anderson one year ago.  Aldo was very tolerant of our questions throughout his visit.  He also suggested items to enhance the performance of our AC.  He knew his stuff!</Review>

<text>Anderson is overpriced manipulated company.  The technician opened up my sealed ac unit even though I specifically said my AC is fine.  I was fortunated done a lot homework and went with airmaxx.  They were abel to fix my AC blower fan capacitor via Anderson pushed me into replace my whole heating system for $6300+.  Please stay away from them.

Just to update.  My AC was ended fixed for $237.  One honest mechanics replaced capacitor and that's it.  Anderson teared my AC and heater all apart.  It would cost even less.< /text>< name>

Aldo Lopez, HVAC tech from Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air came to do a routine check-up/maintenance on our Air Conditioning unit today. Aldo was polite, wore protective gear and practiced good social distancing. He fine tuned our unit, topped off the refrigerant and changed the filter and anything else that was needed. Even though it was raining and muddy, he didn't make a mess. He did give me a couple of recommendations for the future life of our A/C. I would like to have Aldo perform any future HVAC repairs.

We have been using Anderson Plumbing, Heat and Air fir several years, and have never been disappointed.<//Text>

WOW, their commercial is true! They really did wow us with professional service beginning with our plumber's bio before he arrived, covering his shoes & wearing a mask when he did arrive, & getting to the bottom of our problem efficiently & spotlessly.< /Review>

I have had an outstanding  experience having Anderson's plumbing do my central  air conditioning.
The men, Jason, Mario, Peter and electrician, Christian were hard working, respectful group of workers!  Jason was an excellent supervisor. They cleaned up and left my house better than when they came.
I couldn't have asked for a less stressful  project in my home.  JOB WELL DONE!!

I've had other plumbers do work for me in the past but none compare to James from Walter Anderson Plumbing . He was outstanding at cleaning out our backed up drain clog. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and went out of his way to not make a mess and informed me about everything he was doing and about W. A.'s policies. I highly recommend Walter Anderson if all of their employees are anything like James.
I recommend that you look for "Specials" on their website to save a few $$.
Thanks James and Walter Anderson.</review>

Our tech Mr Johnny came to our home on time to perform our yearly VIP check up on our thoroughly happy unit we purchased 2 years ago. He gave us recommended ideas on how to better improve our use and up keep in maintaining our flow of air to last forever. At this time we chose not to purchase more filters but we may do this online at a later time. He has come to our home 2 times and i hope he can come again when we do our next system check up.  Mr Johnny still knows how to give customer service and we really appreciate it. Thank you!</Review>

Michael, the technician came in and was so friendly. Knowledgeable on what he is doing and very professional, he explained to me what was going on with my furnace. He recommended things that I should do to keep my furnace, air conditioning, and plumbing up and working.

The only thing that I wish was lower was the price of the parts and service that was changed and charged. But other than that, the service was excellent.</Text>

Our plumber, Syn, provided the best possible service. We have not experienced a better plumbing service. He was very thorough in explaining the whole process and was down to earth and easy to talk to. He worked to give us the best price possible and was extremely friendly. He seemed to really enjoy working for Anderson Plumbing and spoke very highly of them. I can’t think you enough, Syn and Anderson Plumbing... you made this experience so easy and you have earned a life long customer (as needed of course!)<//Text>

I am super satisfied with my drain clearing service with Anderson plumbing. I liked that they call before heading over, and the plumber that came answered all the questions I had. He also cleared my drain very quickly and told me about what he found in there. I am happy I was able to use a $53 coupon for the service, and I will call them again if I need a plumber. Would recommend.<//Text>

So I am usually not one to write reviews …. but I just had a great experience with Anderson and their pro plumber Ron Miller so here I go.
On the road while my wife deals with a plumbing fiasco long brewing under the sink.  I get home and dial for help.  They said most likely a night call, I was fine with that.  One day turnaround great by me.   Instead, they call back in an hour or so and someone is free now … yea!  Plumber Ron Miller is highly recommended by me.  He is our plumber now..  A pro , not a kid (sorry kids) he has experience and fixed us up, plus another issue I surprised him with.  No problem.   Thanks Anderson and especially Ron!  Highest recommendation from a tough old guy who can't fix anything by himself!< /Text>

I had issues with my heating, plumbing and air conditioning all on the same day. The representative that answered the phone when I called made sure I had an immediate appointment the next day and I was kept apprised of when the technician(s) would be arriving and also whether there was an earlier slot available so that I wouldn't have to wait.

All 3 of the technicians arrived on time and made me feel comfortable that they would resolve the problem.

Donald and Reggie, who handled the plumbing did a wonderful job! They explained everything to me and had me watch as they were doing the work. I have additional work to be done and they gave me options so that I could choose the most cost effective solution for my home and made an appointment to finish the work as soon as possible. Both were very competent, professional and personable and managed to resolve my issue, which gave me peace of mind.

The same was true for Mike, who handled my heating and air conditioning issues. He took the time to thoroughly diagnose and troubleshoot the problems and to make sure I was satisfied with his work before I left. I felt the pricing was reasonable given the fact that the work was warrantied by the company directly and none of them tried to pressure me into choosing a more expensive option. Reggie explained the rationale behind why it would be better to spend a little extra when it came to replacing two of the faucets in my bathroom.

All 3 left their contact info with me so I could reach them if there were any further problems and assured me that the company warranted their  work. They all also talked to me about the company's current promotions but didn't push me into going for any of them.

I had a very positive experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air and I would definitely work with this company again!<//Review>

<Review>They never ask if we think it is a slab leak or outside of the home. They do not do anything for a leak outside a home and refer a company with no major web presence (business website or social media account). Offers to replace a sighted leaking valve for several hundred instead of a simple fix of torquing the gland nut.<//Review><time>1581437246870</time>< userid>

Your workers are the cleanest people I have ever dealt with.  They always put the booties on, clean up their mess.  Are very informative, even about the silliest questions I have.  Are very good looking.  Very, very satisfied with your company.  Thank you, Toni Nagy (and my dog, Woody likes them).<//Review>

The other company who was at our house yesterday was out for a buck, but Andy took time to explain what was going on, was conservative with a treatment plan and went above and beyond what was required of him. As a small business owner, I understand the power of a good experience, and I will be telling EVERY SINGLE PERSON, business owner, friend and acquaintance about how wonderful of a company Anderson is. I am truly blown away by the service. Andy needs a raise, bonus and vacation. He is a gem you have working for you.

I just wanted to leave a review of the billing practices of Anderson Plumbing & Heating, that is the only portion of their work I find to be sub par.  We called them for a leaking toilet in a rental, they showed up at the appointed time and gave us the options of repairing or replacing.  We chose to replace and the work was completed on time and with what appears to be high quality.  My only complaint, the bill.  Parts and labor for an entirely new toilet was $518.98, reasonable.  The total bill was $1179, overhead & profit $660.02, which I think is too high.  They were contacted regarding the bill and they would not offer to cut any of the profit or overhead.</review>

<Review>Plumbing problems are never good, but weekends seem to be when they happen to us.  We were concerned that we might have had to wait for hours for someone to come, but that wasn't the case.

James arrived in less than an hour after we called Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  He listened carefully when we described our situation, and promptly diagnosed the problem.  He got to work and in no time at all cleared the drain and everything was back to normal.

James took care to make sure no dirty water spilled anywhere and he described everything he was doing and why.  It was like getting a mini-plumbing lesson as a bonus.  He cares about his work and it shows.  He is simply the best.

We can't recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air enough.  When we had air conditioning work done previously, we joined their VIP program which we also recommend.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I began my search for a plumber to fix a blockage somewhere in the line by looking for a small, family-owned business to do the job.  I previously had a bad experience with a large company and didn't want to repeat that experience.  Although I found many wonderful plumbers to chose from at reasonable rates, everyone was busy and I was getting impatient.
My mom told me she used Anderson a few times with great results so I gave them a call.  Amazing service!  James was at my door within an hour or two, was polite, skilled and seemed to genuinely enjoy his work.  He spoke highly of his company and represented Anderson well.  Mine was not an easy job.  It required much troubleshooting and James was able to see it through with success!  With an online special they were running, I received and absolutely extraordinary deal.  Also received a nice warranty for the work.  I can't tell you how grateful I am.  Icing on the giant cake-Anderson donates a portion of proceeds to Susan G.

<Text>Brian Blanchard and Justin B spent a very HOT, busy week rerouting our pipes through our attic due to a hot water leak in the cement slab in our La Mesa home. They were role models for what you WISH your plumber could be. They were very professional and involved US in the decision making needed to resolve our problems.  They treated us and our house with respect and consideration. EVERY evening they cleaned up the areas where they had worked diligently all day.  I cannot IMAGINE what the temperature was in our skinny attic!  They didn't just cut off at a respectable closing time, they worked well into the evening hours. They each have an incredible work ethic and take pride in a job well done.  They arrived on schedule and were personally neat and clean.  It is too bad you can't clone these men, because they treated us and our plumbing issues the way YOU would like to be treated.
Thank you for having the good sense to hire these two fine gentlemen.

<text>I am very pleased to recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. Everyone I have dealt with has been exceptional. The staff is very professional, efficient and friendly.  My first experience was with Justin who came to service my disposal. He did an excellent job and I was confident when I later scheduled to have him replace my water heater. Justin is very skilled and knowledgeable. He has a friendly manner and is able to explain all options and answer all questions thoroughly. Justin helped me to obtain the best deal and to use the credit I received from a previous service. When my water heater was installed Justin was assisted by Bethany who was also very professional and knowledgeable. I asked Bethany lots of questions, some of which I thought might be silly, but she patiently and knowledgeably answered each one. I felt very confident in her skills especially as I watched her performing her work. Both Justin and Bethany worked to make sure everything was done perfectly. I was very impressed with the quality of their work. I am very happy with my new disposal and water heater. I can relax knowing they were installed by technicians with exceptional skills using quality products.

My entire experience with Anderson Plumbing was perfect and their office staff is right on par with the way customer service is supposed to be. This is probably the only company I have experienced in San Diego who makes the customers concerns an actual priority. Before I contacted Anderson plumbing I had spent 3 weeks working with my home warranty to get someone out to look for a hard to find water leak. That company spent 2 days trying to find it and were very unprofessional. I kicked them out and called Anderson Plumbing. Within 3 hours of calling they had a technician (Eric) at my house! An hour later, Eric was able to tell me exactly where the leak was (under the slab in the garage) and walked me through the house to show me the route of all my water pipes. Eric with Anderson gave me a quote that was roughly $2000 less than the company my home warranty provided. That other Company ended up being off on the location of the leak by about 30 feet and wanted to jack hammer the slab in my bathroom. Thank God for Eric and Anderson Plumbing and their quality leak detection equipment and skill. If you want it done right you had better call Anderson Plumbing!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1544550185103, 'text': 'Wow! Jared, thank you so much for sharing your experience!

I have been with Anderson since I purchased my home 5 years ago.  They took care of a 25 year old HVAC unit to make it last for another 5 years which I had Anderson replace a few months ago when the old unit finally went out.  This past weekend I had my "VIP" plumbing inspection which was very detailed.  Dylan, my technician, was very thorough checking all of my plumbing including the hot water heater, water pressure valve and explained things as he went along.  A couple of days prior to my inspection my garbage disposal went out.  Dylan, reminded me that Anderson could do the work while he was there.  He took the time and had the new disposal readily available to install. Every technician I have had over the past 5 years are highly trained, qualified and professional.  Their office personnel is as well.  It is nice to have follow up after a service is performed and they do just that to make sure the customer is always satisfied.    I highly recommend Anderson for any of your plumbing, heating & air needs.<//text>

Donald was professional, intelligent and answered all my questions.  He was friendly, personable and honest.  He's truly an asset to your company and would be to any company he works for in the future.  I would like him to be my Maintenance Technician on a regular basis.  Because of Donald, I renewed by VIP membership for 2018.  Thanks for having such a capable man on the job.  It was truly refreshing.<//text>

Anderson plumbing was great. Dylan was my tech and he was informative, experienced, and well spoken. He was able to fix my issue and explain potential issues possibly down the road only for me to prepare. Really good work.< /Review>

Called on 9-5-19 spoke to Tasha and she told me that there is a open window after 12pm but no guarantee. On 9-6-19 I told them I will be home after 330pm. Got home at 4pm and called and spoke with multiple people and every hour and was told I was next. Finally after 4+hrs I got a call and girl who called said that I was not on her list.

I called approximately 6 times and each I was told you will be next you will be next you're next in que the technician is on the way. We really felt let down again.

I stand by what I said above based on what we went through. But I am man enough to say that my man Johnny saved the night. This dude is top notch and really knows his "S"...super cool like the other side of the pillow👊. I wouldn't mine him lending his expertise in the near future. And too the dispatch supervisor thank you for your concern.<//Text>

Eric A., Sal V., and Johnny C. were top notch.  Very professional and courteous.
They are great representatives for their company.  I was particularly impressed how air conditioning installers Sal and Johnny were very careful in their work like covering our carpeting and protecting the work area.  Their attitude was positive and upbeat.  I would recommend Anderson to anyone because of my experience with Eric, Sal, and Johnny.<//review>

Our service tech, Eddie A. was courteous, knowledgeable and friendly. Without asking, he put on some shoe-covers which is greatly appreciated as we don't allow shoes in our home. He was able to explain clearly the work he was there to perform (maintenance inspection) and how long it would take. At the end of the work, he was patient while answering my questions about the recommended actions.< /Text>

The technician, Junior, was very informative and resolved my a/c issue promptly. I was pleased with their call list, for cancelled appointments, that afforded me an earlier appointment.
Only 4 stars because their military discount offered was 3% vice the industry’s standard 10% off</review>

Our technician Dylan was very knowledgeable and efficient. He got to work right away and got the job done. He gave us a detailed assessment at the end and answered our questions fully. The final bill was what I was quoted and what I felt was fair for the work. He added additional value by presenting us with coupons for discounts on Anderson services and recommended further work. I am completely satisfied and would happily recommend Dylan and Anderson.</text>

I have had two remarkably excellent experiences with Anderson Plumbing. Both were large jobs requiring experience, knowledge, and skill to perform. I can report that both jobs were performed with professionalism and at a reasonable price. I am quite satisfied and recommend Anderson to anyone needing small or large plumbing problems resolved.

I was out of town and my pet sitter let me know that the AC was out. I called Anderson plumbing and Heating and they were able to set up a service call the day I arrived home. With it being so hot I didn't think they would be able to come the day after I called. I was grateful that they were able to come service my unit and get us back up and running with cool air immediately.</Text>

Ron Miller came to our house to assess and replace our leaking water heater.  He was on time , professional, and friendly.  He quickly removed the old water heater (under warranty) returned it with the replacement.  Ron installed the replacement and explained the operation.  He did an excellent job and I would highly recommend him.

I am very impressed by your responsiveness and communication.  Anderson had Michael come up quite soon after we called, sent a notice of his arrival with his picture (a great safety technique), and his work was clearly professional.  He knew what he was doing, was clear about the issues found, and well informed as to our options.
Thank you!< /review>

Very pleasant experience with Anderson Plubming! I had an issue with my dishwasher and they were able to send an expert pretty much right away! Dylan was very professional. He diagnosed the issue and explained to me what needed to be done. Then he and his associate fixed the dishwasher within 30 minutes of not less. I would certainly use them again if needed.</Text>

<review>Erik went above and beyond what he was called out for. Couldn't have had a more informed representative from Anderson. Appreciated his honesty, his patient explanations and sound advice. Very friendly and respectful. He checked all around the house, tested water pressure, checked the water heater, and even crawled into our crawlspace to make sure we didn't have any leaks. He recommended a new water heater rather than flushing out the existing. (We have not flushed it in a very long time and the valve is plastic and the risk of cracking wasn't worth it.) Our tank is quite old and it's time to get a new one. I trust his recommendation! Thanks, Erik, and thanks again, Anderson Plumbing, for taking care of us as VIP members!</review><date>1508542157515</date><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Live in a condo & had a leak inside the kitchen wall. The leak damaged the ceiling downstairs. Called Anderson Plumbing, technician James Padgett, and he is so professional. Compared to other plumbers, his knowledge & people skills are excellent. He opened the wall, diagnosed the problem, offered options & estimates, then proceeded to repair everything that needed repaired. The quality of the work is first class & no debris was left behind. I'd rate the service 10 out of 10. Then he came back to install a pressure regulator. Again, extremely friendly & professional. The quality of the work was awesome. I really like my experience with this company, will advocate for them, & will use them again in the future. Patrick..<//Text>

After spending a day trying to unclog a toilet I realized I needed a plumber!
I noticed that Anderson Plumbing had a special of unclogging any drain for $53.  Seemed too good to be true, but it actually was the case, and am so glad I called them as they had the correct toilet auger and the toilet now works as it should!!
Thank you Anderson Plumbing, you really did WOW me!!< /text>

George, my technician, provided outstanding service during the service call on 12/6/17.  He was prompt and courteous.  He was neat, clean and his uniform presented the company well.  He was proficient at his job, ensured to maintain cleanliness at the work site, and took care to protect my floors and home from any damage.  He thoroughly explained what the problem was and the repairs he was making.  He offered good tips on dealing with the water issues in San Diego.  He thoroughly deserves the 5-star rating.  Thanks George.< /text>

We replaced our heater and air conditioner and all of the ducting. Zack and Donny did an excellent job, considering the heavy rain outside when they installed AC compressor.  These two guys were responsible, friendly and a joy to work with. Anderson is lucky to have great employees like them.

Explained everything to us. Gave us options. Everything in writing! Super courteous and experienced. Quiet. Cleaned up after themselves every day. Never treate our home as a construction site!
Thorough. Respectful. Supervisor came out just to see how things were progressing! How many companies do that??
Would we use them again? You bet.Would we recommend them? Absolutely. Will you be glad you chose them? You will probably never use anyone else. They spoil you.</Review>

Anderson Plumbing is the best.  They are ethical, competitively priced, a pleasure to work with.  Specifically, Ricardo Sandoval is the best of the best.  His drain line expertise is the best in the business and I refer him to all of my clients.  I can't recommend this company enough.  And, they give back to the community and are so charitable.<//review>

Rudy performed our annual VIP plumbing inspection.  He inspected all of the toilets and sinks in our home.  In addition, he drained our two water heaters.  We also requested him to clear a bathroom sink drain, repair a kitchen faucet and re-pipe a drain in our laundry room.   From the time Rudy arrived, he immediately went to work and completed a thorough inspection.  It was a difficult task to clear the bathroom sink.  It required full disassembly and replacement of parts.  He diagnosed the back-up problem in our laundry room and was able to resolve the drainage issue.
It took three hours to complete all of this work.  We are very appreciative of Rudy's high quality work and commitment to fixing each problem correctly.< /text>

Katy was the best technician I have ever had work on my AC unit.  She found the back wiring connection and had the unit back up and running after troubleshooting the problem of freezing up.  She came after 7:00PM the very same day I called and was working when most people were off and home with their families.

I appreciate her for her effort.

James was on time, as I told them that I had just got off a 12 hour shift and had to work tonight.  They worked with me and I really appreciated it. The work was done quickly and efficiently. James was very polite and explained all that was going to take place. I will recommend this company to everyone that I know. Great employee and great work!!!

<review>First if of , I appreciated the fact that the technician came early in the day, and not 30 minutes prior to the end of the "morning" time frame. I've lost hours of personal leave from work due to the service provider's inconsiderate scheduling tactics.
The technician, Johnny Castro, was prompt, professional, and knowledgeable! But most of all she displayed sincere empathy to my situation.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This has been a long drawn out process. We had 4 quotes for our new air conditioning. Although Anderson did not come in the least expensive we liked the professionalism and warranty. But things went downhill from there. Communication was horrible. We were to have our install Monday morning and I had to call Friday just before 5 to find out when they were coming. Upon install they could not get the wireless thermostat to install and said they were going to send someone back out to connect it. I again had to call 4 days later to find out when someone was coming to fix or replace it. He could not fix it- and had to come back again with a new unit. Sooooo we thought everything was great and  then we got a call that they installed the incorrect (Lower power) unit. So we had to schedule another install date. Again no one called to let us know when they were coming out- a “discount check” was promised to be mailed or brought with the technician and of course it wasn’t so they had to send a runner with the check. Bottom line we are super happy with the product and all of the people that come to our home. But the people in the office lack all sorts of professionalism.</review>

I’ve had awful experiences with plumbers and so I’m happy to be writing a positive review for once. I found the workers who came to my home to be professional and very thorough. They explained the process to me every step of the way. I wish I’d called them earlier. I recommend this company!<//Review>

<Text>Larry was courteous and professional and educational when teaching my how to clean/maintain my own plumbing needs if I choose to.
Because of his expertise, we tried to actually find more work for him to fix to get his opinion on other issues, besides my initial dishwasher drainage problem.

I am very grateful for his work , and he actually saved me a lot of time.</Text>< Pictures>

James B from Anderson is a fantastic plumber. I thought the drain from the toilet to the main line was blocked but he ran a few tests and determined the blockage was actually in the low-flow toilet itself. The problem was that the flush handle was not being held down long enough with the result that  the bowl was getting insufficient water so  toilet paper was not being pushed through the trap (located in the toilet) to the sewer pipe. On these low flow toilets you can't just press and release the handle- if you do the flapper valve will close prematurely. You must press and hold the handle down to keep the flapper valve open until all the water in the tank has entered the bowel.<//Review>

<review>I am Wowed once again!  We have been using Anderson Heating and Plumbing for several years, not only for our own home, but also our rentals.  The technicians are always courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. Years ago we went through several plumbers, that on the face of it were cheaper, but they took much long and often did not do the job correctly.  You get what you pay for.  This is a top notch firm, that often prices out much better because they know what they are doing and have the supplies with them. Thank you!  Kuddos to James who found the problem today, and fixed it in no time!!!!<//review>< Resp>

They used to be fast and efficient.  but this weekend they lost a customer.  Friday night, with 12 guests at the house, my Mom's drain backed up while washing dishes..One they had worked on in September.  As  VIP customer, we were told the earliest appointment was Thursday, 5 days away!  Needless to say we called another company and got someone out the next morning.< /text>

<review>I am Wowed once again!  We have been using Anderson Heating and Plumbing for several years, not only for our own home, but also our rentals.  The technicians are always courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. Years ago we went through several plumbers, that on the face of it were cheaper, but they took much long and often did not do the job correctly.  You get what you pay for.  This is a top notch firm, that often prices out much better because they know what they are doing and have the supplies with them. Thank you!  Kuddos to James who found the problem today, and fixed it in no time!!!!<//review><rating>5< /rating>< gmap_id>

From the initial phone call, which made me smile, to last hand shake, working with Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air was great!  Alex arrived, assessed the situation and clearly explained all of my options.  He was clear and answered all of my questions, and I ask a lot of questions.  He quickly took care of the necessary repairs and made sure I was in great shape before leaving.  I am incredibly happy with their honesty and way of doing business.  Thank you Alex and thank you Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air!<//Review>

< Review>
Jason, our plumber saved the night. He was professional and competent. Rate was reasonable, considering we needed after hour service to unclog the seeer line to get toilet and tub working again.
Thankfully my husband had already removed the toilet from the floor to access the sewer line, bit clog was too deep for him to get to, but if if he had not removed toilet and then replaced it after Jason left, then gets much more expensive.< /Review>

Brian Dudley arrived at our house on time as promised with a very professional manner.  He was very knowledgeable, efficient, thorough, and explained his job to me.  When he offered additional services, I was quick to sign up, because he informed me of all the benefits and cost savings involved.  I will always request Brian for my heating and air conditioning service from now on.  Not only is he a great service provider, he also has a winning personality!</review>

<review>After finishing some remodeling/refinishing on our house, we needed our duct system upgraded to better fit our home. After using Anderson numerous times before (and signing up for their VIP program) they were the only company I wanted to come do the work. Samson and Pauly were punctual, courteous, and immediately put on their booties and laid down drop cloths to protect my floors. They explained to me what they would be doing today before even bringing their tools into the house. They were focused in their work, respectful, and had the house cleaned up before walking me through to show me the new changes, as well as turn the system on and off to ensure everything was spot on. I will continue to use Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air for all my plumbing, a/c and furnace needs!!< /review>< time>

<Time>1550113283135<//Time><review>Anderson does good work, especially if you need repairs within a short period of time. They are very expensive. They do give you upfront pricing, but not itemized pricing. It seems that the hourly rate can work out to $500-600 / hour on top of a trip charge. The tech also jumped into trying to sell several other high ticket items, before wanting to discuss the issue to be repaired. It is also not professional to drop hints on how much he earns, while you feel you are being overcharged. Had we been able to wait, our $1000 job could have been done for about $500.</review>< Resp>

Eric handled my problem beautifully!  He diagnosed the leak source, found the part needed, and replaced it in one trip to parts store without any trial and error.  The room where he worked was left better than when he arrived.

Julie and Kristi kept me informed of Eric’s whereabouts so I could keep to my schedule.<//Text>

The guys that came out were professional and courteous. When I have the install done, I can tell you more.

8/3/18: The team that came out to install my ac and heat were also excellent. Really knowledgble, professional and courteous. They also explained things if I asked. Very happy with them.< /review>

<Review>Dave G. was the best! He patiently answered all of my questions and was professional and efficient in descaling my tankless water heaters and clearing out a sink drain. Dave was very personable and knowledgeable and I felt confident that his recommendations were sincere. I would highly recommend Dave and so far this company has been great to deal with!</Review><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</GmapID><user_id>112377818627564223160< /user_id><Time>1505504113522</Time>< pictures>

<Review>We had our annual furnace inspection done by Eduardo A from Anderson. His service, attention to detail, and patience were exceptional. He put shoe covers on his feet before entering the house,  answered all questions asked of him regarding specs on the furnace. He was polite, professional and his work ethic is commendable.   Excellent decision in hiring him,  continue the great work.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Excellent job.  Thank you, Ruben.  Would have no other plumbing & heating company do installations or repair work for us.  The technicians are very knowledgeable, efficient, and professional.  We had our AC/heating unit installed last year and very happy with the job.  Today it is a plumbing issue which has been resolved.  Next will be a replacement for our electric hot water heater.  Thank you Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air!!< /Review>

<review>My house is older and has some big trees on the property, so I have had ongoing plumbing issues over the years.  I've just had the plumbing system replaced by Anderson, which was a two week job.  Every single person who came out was professional, experienced, communicative, and knowledgeabe.  There was also some follow-up work to be done, and again, the technicians were very helpful and knowledgeable.
I really think that Anderson has some of the best customer service of any company of any kind.  It is not just a slogan, but is completely true.<//review>< pics>

He kept me apprised of what his plan for installing a new air duct in my guest bath and installing an air cleaner on my heating and air unit.  He took great care to keep the work area clean and swept up anything that was still on the floor when he finished.  All in all a great experience.</Review>

I have been using Anderson Plumbing for a long time.  I have found all the technicians to be courteous and professional.  On the last maintenance call for my furnace, a wire to the compressor came loose after the tech left, but she battled the traffic at the end of the day to return and fix it...much appreciated!</review>

Brian Dudley did a 6-month inspection of my heating system and was very thorough and informative. He showed me all the things he checked, changed the filter, checked the air ducts and thermostat and even fixed a broken light switch that I'd been told couldn't be fixed! (The light switch was NOT on the list of things he was supposed to check; he went over and above the call of duty there!) Thanks for the great work, Brian!</review>

<review>I just had my furnace and air conditioning unit replaced by Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  My installer's name was Zachary Brock, and his assistant was Marcus.  Zac was very professional, friendly, and was always happy to answer any questions.  Both he and Marcus worked extremely well together and completed the install in a very timely manner.  They left the work area spotless and were always considerate to wear booties when walking in inside of the house.  I could not be happier with both of them.<//review><Name>Keith Katayama</Name><UserId.>116291094923085349332<//UserId.>< gmapID>

James came and fixed my toilet problem and cleared the line. Chris came to  lend a helping hand and gave me a price on a new toilet and a clean out port  on my sewer line. These two young men were very professional and did the job in record time. They were two great employees of Anderson Plumbing!

We have used Anderson Plumbing for small and large, simple and complicated, calm and crisis situations and they have come through every time.  Knowledgeable.  Courteous.  On time.  Fairly priced.  It's one of those rare companies where you actually feel a tinge of happiness writing the check, because you know that you are supporting a company that values things like excellence, professionalism, and the people they hire.< /Text>

Katy was my technician and she was very professional, knowledgeable and kind! I felt like she truly cared about my ac problem and provided me with several choices. Katy made sure I understood the options and I did not feel pressured towards one over the others. I decided to go the repair route as it better suited my budget. I decided to wait a few days before writing this to ensure I was completely satisfied and I can without a doubt say that I am!! Katy was a pleasure and I will definitely be using Andersen in the future and requesting Katy! She is a great asset to the company and I will be recommending her to my friends and family!!</review>

Tim's exceptional rapport and made me fell at ease right away. He performed a preliminary check and quickly went to work. He completed the job in an hour! (Clogged Toilet.

< Review>
Miguel one of the Drain Specialists at Anderson Plumbing and Heating was a pleasure to work with.  He was always available to explain various options for how to fix and improve my drain system.  He also pointed out ways we could save money.  Thank you Miguel!

Herman was the man on the job who did the work.  That guy can do anything from hammering thru a slab to the finesse work like soldering copper pipe supply lines.  My old 1959 house has awesome modern plumbing and drain system now.  He knows his stuff and explains everything in a friendly informative manner.  He came up with some great suggestions for improvements that I hadn't thought of.  The guy is pure gold!  Thank you Herman!<//Review>

Exceptional service!!  Emergency call at nearly 4:00 pm to Anderson Plumbing on a plugged up toilet at my mother-in-laws house, they were able to send James B almost immediately and he quickly cleared the clog, checked the overall toilet function and all other bathroom drains.  We will be using Anderson Plumbing in the future.  Thanks so much, your Company provides exceptional services!<//Text>

<Text>It started with a meeting with Fonzo, who was professional and willing to learn the specifics of my needs and who also dug into some of the details of my particular installation needs.
The installers, Jacob and Adrian, did outstanding work, with close attention to detail. They were willing to let me watch and involve myself into the job as much as I wanted. The job was, in my opinion, a tough one to accomplish, and Jacob and Adrian went above and beyond to get it done right.
Dennis visited the installation site and helped out in getting the compressor/condenser properly located. I believe it is always a good idea to have a supervisor at the job site to support the installers. Great job by all mentioned.<//Text>< Pics>

James P and apprentice Drew WERE HERE RIGHT ON SCHEDULED. JAMES EXPLAINED, IN DETAIL, THE OPTIONS I HAD FOR THE WATER HEATER.  HE ASKED QUESTION ie,  "HOW MANY BATHROOMS HAD SHOWERS".  HE DID NOT PRESSURE ME DECIDING WHAT SIZE, BUT DID OFFER ADVICE.  HE ALSO GAVE ME A SENIOR DISCOUNT.  I WILL RECOMMEND YOUR BUSINESS, AS MY PLUMBER, PETE,  RECOMMENDED  YOU.<//review>

James Blacker saved us from a very challenging clog in our main sewer outlet. He tried twice to reach it through an undersized cleanout, hoping to save us the cost to remove and replace the toilet - but this old house would not give up the fight so easily. James then consulted with me and I agreed to remove the toilet to give him better access. James doggedly refused to give up until he had a tricky reclosing congestion fully cleared. This was not routine (nothing in our old house ever is), but James rose to the challenge.

He was professional and courteous and communicated pricing and expectations clearly and honestly at every stage. In the end, he left us feeling the service was top notch and the price paid quite reasonable.

Anderson is lucky to have James Blacker. So were we.<//Text>

When my sixty year old cast iron pipes needed to be replaced a friend recommended Anderson Plumbing. I called them and Ricardo came out and looked at it. He explained what the problem was, what my options were and gave me an estimate. He was informative and professional. I decided to use their company. They were able to start the work in a couple of days,. Ruben and Michael were here every day on time and I have rarely seen men work so hard. In 100 degree heat. They had to dig up part of the slab in the garage, part of a sidewalk, my kitchen wall and big holes in my front lawn. Every night when they left everything was safe and tidy and put away, they were friendly and personable and knew what they were about. When the job was finished, everything had been restored, they even cut sod out of my lawn and replaced it perfectly. Ricardo made sure all was going well, which it was. They were respectful of me and my property, put up with my yappy little dog and all in all did an excellent job. I wholeheartedly recommend them and won't use anyone else. Top notch company!!<//Text>

We were very pleased with the prompt and exceptional Customer Service we received from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air. Being that it was a busy Saturday; they still managed to fit us into their schedule on short notice.
From the moment we spoke to the technician Michael Probst; he was very friendly and willing to answer all of our questions without rushing us off the phone. He arrived at our home in the time frame he said he would be here.
I would highly recommend this company to anyone.< /text>

Every time, the technician has arrived on time, and has been very nice, courteous, and respectful. I have never hesitated to let a single technician into my home. They seem like really nice people. Very professional.

Most of the time, there’s no upsell or extras… They come in, assess, and give recommendation options based on what they see. They provide hard facts and data to support their recommendations. There’s never any pressure to do anything. As a homeowner, I appreciate that. I appreciate each technician’s honesty and integrity. They always do good work on my house- and I definitely recommend Anderson PHA!<//review>< username>

Best check of the heating system ever. He  could and did explain the problems and also what the  could be done to solve them, in a way I could understand.
I will request him for future appointments.

Horrible service,  I called Anderson Plumbing service and they sent someone-who without looking where the leak said that he was going to charge $717 and later said that he will charge me less. He is not fix the leak and wanted to pay for $717 and the second day wanted an additional $717.<//Text>

I love Anderson Plumbing ,Heating and Air.
They have rescued my plumbing more than once. I have an older house and it is always needing something.
I can call and speak to a real person. I can have the same person who is familiar with my plumbing come out. They have all records of previous jobs.
You receive a warranty for work done. They are careful of your property and leave it clean and safe each day when they finish.
This is who you call when you want the job done right.< /Text>

Bernard went above and beyond to get our heater up and running in our new home.  On top of all of that, we ran into a plumbing issue while our tile person was removing the toilet, he was willing to take 5 minutes of his time to let us know what we needed to do.  We will be coming to Anderson for good now.</Review>

Excellent customer service. My issue didn’t end up being plumbing related but the technician helped me determine the source of the problem even though he easily could’ve walked away once he found out it wasn’t a plumbing issue. That kind of customer service seems like a rarity these days.</Text>

I bought and installed a new toilet from Anderson. The service technician was professional, patient, courteous, and really, really nice. During installation, he discovered the previous toilet was installed incorrectly and rather than leaving it as-is, he informed me and fixed everything before installing the new toilet. Even gave me good carpentry advice, in addition to good plumbing advice! Will be getting a call from me in the future for any plumbing jobs.< /Text>

<Review>I called Anderson to inquire about completely replacing my HVAC system in my home. When I scheduled the appointment I was assured someone would be at my home at a specific time, and that person would contact me the day of the appointment to confirm. On the day of my appointment, I never received a phone call, and even at the time of my appointment no one showed up.  20 minutes after when my appointment was going to be I had to contact Anderson to find out what happened. The operator for Anderson said "yes I see you at an appointment set for a specific time, let me see where our person is" then I was told "they will be there in 15 minutes". Well 25 minutes later and still no show, so I had to contact Anderson again. This time the operator started out giving me attitude saying "you don't understand, we don't set specific times for appointments, we give time frames".  I was then placed on hold for about 10 minutes while the operator called the person to see where they were. When the operator returned they said "Our man is at your front door right now". I about snapped because I was standing out front of my house waiting and saw nobody.  I wonder how a company that says they have great customer service can treat someone like this who isn't even their customer, and is looking to them to become their customer. If a company is this unprofessional, rude and disrespectful I would not want them doing any business with me, let alone in my house.< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< userid>

We were very pleased with the prompt and exceptional Customer Service we received from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air. Being that it was a busy Saturday; they still managed to fit us into their schedule on short notice.
From the moment we spoke to the technician Michael Probst; he was very friendly and willing to answer all of our questions without rushing us off the phone. He arrived at our home in the time frame he said he would be here.
I would highly recommend this company to anyone.< /Text>

Anderson Plumbing, Heating, and Air has been great for each of the services I’ve used them for- and I’ve used them for all three!
Every time, the technician has arrived on time, and has been very nice, courteous, and respectful. I have never hesitated to let a single technician into my home. They seem like really nice people. Very professional.

Most of the time, there’s no upsell or extras… They come in, assess, and give recommendation options based on what they see. They provide hard facts and data to support their recommendations. There’s never any pressure to do anything. As a homeowner, I appreciate that. I appreciate each technician’s honesty and integrity. They always do good work on my house- and I definitely recommend Anderson PHA!< /review>

It was a very nice experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  Our water heater was leaking and upon calling Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air - Julie answered the call and was extremely nice and helpful. She took the information and informed me that a Service Technician would be calling within the next 4 hours prior to coming out that afternoon.  Within 10 to 15 minutes, I received another call back indicating a Service Technician would be able to make it out within 1/2 hour to 1 hour. Ruben Reyes arrived within the hour - extremely fast service.  He promptly reviewed the situation and provided the options for replacing the water heater.  He was able to replace the water heater that same afternoon. In addition, to replacing the water heater he provided additional great customer service by looking at our water filtration system that was installed by Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air 5 years ago and it checked out ok.  Ruben even added additional piping outside where the water filtration system drains so it would go further away from the house and actually water more of the outside bushes when it does drain.  Great for us and the area especially with the local water issues.  Thank you again to a Great Staff at Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air - keep up the good work.< /review>

Magil Duran came out late on a Saturday and really went out of his way to identify where the water was leaking from the units and then rectify the problem.  He was extremely professional and efficient.  We really appreciate all he did and he reassured us that Anderson would do everything they can to fix the problem.  It’s frustrating when there’s problems with your new unit but it’s very comforting to know that the Anderson VIP service is going to make it right as soon as possible.

<review>A++ experience.  I had pipe start to leak about 1 month ago.  Called Anderson Plumbing and they were able to get someone out to my house quickly.  Chris B. fixed the leak and then recommended a whole home filter system to prevent future leaks.  I called this week to have the system installed and they still honored the quote given to me from a month ago.  Chris came back out to my home and installed the system in a timely and professional manner.  The work was top notch.  I am very pleased with the whole experience.  Recommend Highly!!!<//review>< pics>

Donald did a great job, answering all of our questions and informing us of all the options with maintaining our HVAC system. He went the extra mile to put a huge smile on our face! He's the guy we'll look to for keeping our house cool in the summer and warm in the winter! Thank so much Donald, and thank you Stephanie for the easy appointment setup!!< /Review>

I called and was very upset that we were cold and our heater thermostat was not working. Andersons sent two very nice technicians out to help. We now have heat, and I have to apologize.  Great company!</text>

< Review>
When I first called Anderson Plumbing it was to fix the thermostat on my air conditioner. They told me that the unit was old (7 years old) and could not be replaced. That I would need to put in a new unit with new air conditioners. Having spent thousands of dollars with this company I figured that I had enough experience with them so that I could call them to fix a simple problem with the hot water in my shower. When they came I was told that I needed a new water softener unit for another few thousand dollars but my shower was fixed for the time being.
A couple of days later,when I had the same problem with the hot water in my shower, I made another appointment. At this appointment ,with another technician, I was told that I needed a different unit ,for another few thousand dollars, and the unit the first technician told me I needed wouldn't work. At this point I decided that I needed a second opinion from another company. In the meantime I found that the last guy they sent out had broken the hot cold water mixer on my shower. They escalated the problem to a repair supervisor who came out that week. He told me that they would have to replace the mixer on my shower, at no cost to me, and would call me in 2 days with an update as well as the exact cost of the new water softener unit he said I needed.
Two weeks later I still hadn't heard back from him. On the third week I received a message on my machine stating that the mixer had to be ordered from the manufacturer  and he would call me back the next day to discuss it. He had already tols me that it had to be replaced and I had foolishly assumed that he would do that first thing not three weeks later.
Three months later I still hadn't heard back from Anderson when I received an email message telling me it was time to make a service appointment on my air conditioners. I wrote back that I wouldn't be making any appointments with Anderson and to please remove me from their mailing list. That day I got a phone call from a very nice understanding lady who stated she was new to the job but that she was trying to straighten out problems that customer had had. She told me she would call Jose,the supervising technician who had come out the last time, and get back to me. True to her word she called me back the next day and informed me that she had ordered the part. She offered to call me every week to keep me updated which I declined.
Finally,after months, I got a call from her that the new part had come in and we made an appointment to install it.
The next time I tried to use my shower I found that only scalding hot water was coming out. No cold water to mix the hot water with. I called them to tell them what the situation was and she offered to send Jose back out to check on the problem. She informed me that since I had a tankless hot water system sometimes it took some time for the new unit to adjust. Now this explanation made no sense to me and if it makes sense to you then I'd suggest Anderson for your plumbing needs. It seems that in fixing one problem they always create a new one. To have them come out to try to fix it would be free but even at free it's far to expensive for me.
I wouldn't recommend Anderson to anyone  They're always   trying to sell you something new and can't seem to be able to do what they are hired to do correctly.
Stay far far away from this company.

<review>I called Anderson to inquire about completely replacing my HVAC system in my home. When I scheduled the appointment I was assured someone would be at my home at a specific time, and that person would contact me the day of the appointment to confirm. On the day of my appointment, I never received a phone call, and even at the time of my appointment no one showed up.  20 minutes after when my appointment was going to be I had to contact Anderson to find out what happened. The operator for Anderson said "yes I see you at an appointment set for a specific time, let me see where our person is" then I was told "they will be there in 15 minutes". Well 25 minutes later and still no show, so I had to contact Anderson again. This time the operator started out giving me attitude saying "you don't understand, we don't set specific times for appointments, we give time frames".  I was then placed on hold for about 10 minutes while the operator called the person to see where they were. When the operator returned they said "Our man is at your front door right now". I about snapped because I was standing out front of my house waiting and saw nobody.  I wonder how a company that says they have great customer service can treat someone like this who isn't even their customer, and is looking to them to become their customer. If a company is this unprofessional, rude and disrespectful I would not want them doing any business with me, let alone in my house.<//review>< Pics>

Kevin did a great job explaining in detail the problem with your A/C unit.  He came in a timely manner from when we received the phone call of when he was expected to arrive. He was thorough with his assessment and took his time with what he recommended. We did not feel any pressure to move decide or move forward right then and there. He laid out all possible options and left reassuring us that either decision Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air would accommodate. Thank you for great customer service!<//text>

Our A/C went out on Monday, we called Anderson for service and they came out on Tuesday, flipped the circuit breaker, it came on and they left. The temp didn't change with the motor running, so they came out again on Wednesday to install a new thermostat. The next day it still wasn't right, so we called them again and they couldn't get back to us until the following Monday! After a heat wave over the weekend, Monday arrived and they had to switch out two more thermostat's before it worked correctly. We would have been "Wow'd" if they fixed it correctly the first time and didn't make us wait four more days to help us out.< /Text>

my name is Erica swimmer

My visit today from Quinton, was a perfect experience in every way!

Best check of the heating system ever. He  could and did explain the problems and also what the  could be done to solve them, in a way I could understand.
I will request him for future appointments.

Thank you Anderson  co</Review>

< review>
I contacted Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air to set up appointments for maintenance of my A/C and water heater. The staff and technicians were all very helpful, pleasant and efficient.  During a check of my home water pressure the technician, Ken Slater , discovered that my main water valve was not operating correctly which resulted in my water pressure to be approximately 115 psi, almost double what is recommended.  Ken was very helpful and courteous and I am glad he caught this before any major damage was done to my water lines.  Many thanks go to the Anderson employees.

The service was great , they sent the plumber out as soon as they could.... And gave me a 30 minute window by calling ahead.
Tim was the plumber who came to my home and was really helpful and assessed the problem . He did a great job and got our sink  running again .  Thank Tim and thank you Anderson Plumbing for fast and great service. Will definitely call you again if we ever have another plumbing problem .😊👍</Review>

Bryan Olson - Very prompt, professional.  Arrived in my place and find out the problem right away.  Corrected and double check my AC system and ensured that the whole system is working properly. My AC is up and running and enjoying the cool house during this hot weather.  Entire customer service was Superb and they was able to accommodate my service call in a few hour. Not next business day. Thank you Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air. Bryan is a keeper😀😀😀👍</Review>

We are very happy with the service provided by Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air.  Mr. Vito Romani performed a heater maintenance  checkup in our home.

Sal and Mac were the ultimate professionals.  They worked non-stop and were a delight to have in my home.  Sal spent way too much time cooking in my attic on a terribly hot day but never complained.  The work he did is excellent.  I highly recommend Anderson and Sal for anyone who needs a great HVAC system.</Review>

<Text>I had my AC maintenance check and Mr. Johnny Castro was my HVAC Maintenance Technician.  He was very nice and professional and addressed all of my concerns and questions.  My AC unit was using excessive power which can effect the performance over the longterm so I purchased a fairly inexpensive device that significantly reduced the power demand into well within the normal range.  I really appreciated this suggestion to help extend the lifetime of my AC unit.  I was also using more air filters than I needed which was affecting the efficiency of my system.  I really appreciated the education about my AC system.  Johnny is very knowledgeable and personable. Having a technician that is highly competent and knowledgeable and who seems to care about me as a client is why I stay with Anderson Plumbing.  I am really thankful for their care for my home over the past years.  Thank you!</Text>< pics>

Justin was professional and did a great job installing a new water heater. He explained in detail why we needed a new water heater, the features of the new water heater, and how much it would cost. He gave us three estimate for the water heater alone, and then the water heater and some plumbing work. He never forced the sale and we felt comfortable with him the whole way. Anderston Plumbing, Heating & Air is a great company and employees like Justin are the reason why.< /Text>

I am a VIP customer (cancelled) who had three problems in my bathroom.  A very knowledgeable technician arrived on time to bid on repairing problem.  Prices quoted were absurd, like an automobile repair,
Each item was individually priced: e.g.  $200 to put flapper on toilet and reinsert flush handle (I had the parts); $200 to look under sink to repair leak ( loose plastic nut on drain lever) and no quote to repair leaking faucet as he didn't have the part on truck even tho when I made the appointment I specifically stated the the make of the faucet handle.

Eric Teran is a real pro! he's very personable and easy to talk to.  from the beginning you feel right at ease.  he explains everything clearly and takes time to answer any questions you have, even while he's working.  he did everything that was needed, and he left the work space very clean.  afterwords, he showed how everything was done and sat down to explain how everything works.  we're extremely happy with job.  it's so nice to have a QUIET hot water heater. there is no more banging coming from the garage and it works great!  you can send Eric back out anytime we need something fixed.
THANKS again eric

After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!< /text>

Good guy, knew his stuff, explained everything and dealt with out landlord.< /Text>< user>

<Review>Michael (the service technician) was: on-time, professional, polite, explained each step of the repair, and described each of the corrective options clearly so I could make an informed choice.
I would recommend the VIP maintenance plan to anyone with an older AC system.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Had Miguel and Bethany install a water heater and pressure regulator for the house. Very professional and friendly. Kept us informed every step of the way.
Contacted Anderson via web-site, did not get reply within 24hrs. As advertised. I called a few days later to get the service we needed.

Reggie D. was very professional, honest and told me everything that was wrong with the garbage disposal and pipe on toilet in master bed room.  Recommended a new garbage disposal and new pipe.  Because of of rust issues.  I would recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air to my friends.  Good job Reggie D.< /Review>

Justin was professional and did a great job installing a new water heater. He explained in detail why we needed a new water heater, the features of the new water heater, and how much it would cost. He gave us three estimate for the water heater alone, and then the water heater and some plumbing work. He never forced the sale and we felt comfortable with him the whole way. Anderston Plumbing, Heating & Air is a great company and employees like Justin are the reason why.<//Review>

WOW -I had a problem with a tank less water heater.  I needed a "before noon"  appointment the next day and they made it happen. They were on time and very courteous and professional. They gave me 3 different options  to solve my problem.  Not a "you need this" attitude.  A picked my option and thought they would come back in a day or two to do the job.  That did not happen!! They ( Eric the tec ) went back to the shop and picked up everything need for the job. He returned and did the job right away.  That is customer service at it's best.  I will definitely be calling Anderson Pluming  in the future.  (that is if the need arises)   Thank's so much for your quality service.      David< /Text>

Oh my goodness!! This was my first experience with Anderson Plumbing and I hope I have to use them again!! Every step of the process was easy and I got an appt quickly. I received a heads up when they’d be there and then a call about what needs to be done and if I authorize the work. Then I received a follow up call that the work was completed. Which is the goal, but then I was educated on how to prevent it from happening again. Given tips on what to do if it does. It was just so nice to deal with someone that genuinely cared and not just going through the motions. Having things go wrong when life is already busy and full of stress sucks, but now I know if my sink clogs again and I call Anderson Plumbing they take of the hard part!!

Thank you again sooooooo very much!!!</Text>

I was looking for a good contractor to provide me with a quote for a leaking water main pipe.  One contractor quoted me $7000 to do the repair and told me that it would take 5-7 days to fix.  I called several other contractors and was impressed with Ken's professionalism and knowledge.  The price he quoted for the work was a lot less than the initial quote that I got from the other company.  After meeting with several other contractors I decided to go with Anderson< /review>

My technician Justin B was a true professional and knowledgeable with a passion for his job. I son’t know why I waited so long to call Anderson PHA for any issues around my house. I’ve called other big names companies on weekend and was told they couldn’t help since I wasn’t a previous customer.  I hope my neighbors enjoyed seeing the PINK truck in front of my house.  I’ve already passed the word onto my neighbors and co-workers.< /Text>

<text>Anderson Plumbing rerouted our drain around the outside of the house, across the garage, and connected to main drain to street. All cutting of concrete were straight and cleanly cut. Everything was put back together and re-buried like it was prior to repairs done. Crew was very polite, and professional. Herman, the lead technician worked hard, and was very efficient with his work. He is a great asset to Anderson plumbing. I highly recommend Anderson to anyone that needs plumbing services.<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>Chris finished in the amount of time that was estimated at the start of the job.  He showed up on time. He appeared knowledgeable and completed the work efficiently and effectively.  The place was left clean.  He replaced a shower/bath combo fixture set which included opening up the wall and doing some pipe work.  I have confidence that we will love it for years to come.  He also replaced a valve under our kitchen sink.  So happy with the work.< /review>< Pictures>

Vito arrived on time and completed our HVAC inspection quickly. His attention to detail was excellent; insuring that our system was ready for the next heat wave. All of my experiences with Anderson PHA have been 5-star!<//Text>

After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!< /review>

Ken is a very qualified and professional technician with over 26 years experience in the plumbing field. He was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions and more. He gave me some valuable tips regarding the hot water recirculating pump that he installed. Great job Ken!<//Review>

<Review>Anderson Plumbing was one of the only companies to return our call when we needed immediate service for our AC over the holiday weekend. They returned our call within 24 hours and had someone out to service the AC the very next day, (Maria really knows her stuff). The AC was up and running within a couple of hours. Everyone from the dispatcher to the office staff and our technician was professional, courteous and responsive.< /Review>< pics>

I recently had a new water heater installed in my home. Ken S was the installer, he did a great job, was courteous, neat and clean. When finished, he cleaned up what little mess created and left the work area spic and span. I was very happy with the service.< /review>

<review>Had kitchen drain clog that I could not get myself with snake, called Anderson, the technician was prompt, professional, knowledgeable and fixed the problem within a few minutes.  Wish I hadn't bothered myself first!  But he did give me tips on how to resolve the problem myself the next time- which I really appreciated.  Very impressed with this service.< /review>< Pics>

All my questions and concerns were answered politely, promptly and properly. This is my usual experience with this company - great service, work warranty and nice people to work with.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I am saddened that you are losing Jacob Berry, He is one of the best young men I have ever had the pleasure to have work in or on my home.  He is articulate and cogent in his discussions with me at every step he was taking on the Air Conditioning system he was servicing.

He is the type of young man which expresses what your Logo says.  I actually though he said, "Nobody loves clients like we do" and of course I though, how perfectly it suits the person Jacob is.  That was until I went to your site and realized that had said the word "Wows", not "Loves" and had myself a good laugh, because I have hearing aids that sometimes do not pick up intonations or certain verbal cues.

Next year when I have my system serviced, I would hope that you send someone like Jacob who helps me feel very confident in their capabilities and willingness to share their knowledge.

I am very particular about the types of service people I have work on my stuff, whether it was my new roof, or having my car service, or my plumbing work done.  Anderson has proven so far that they will be my go to company to take care of my STUFF !!

WOW -I had a problem with a tank less water heater.  I needed a "before noon"  appointment the next day and they made it happen. They were on time and very courteous and professional. They gave me 3 different options  to solve my problem.  Not a "you need this" attitude.  A picked my option and thought they would come back in a day or two to do the job.  That did not happen!! They ( Eric the tec ) went back to the shop and picked up everything need for the job. He returned and did the job right away.  That is customer service at it's best.  I will definitely be calling Anderson Pluming  in the future.  (that is if the need arises)   Thank's so much for your quality service.      David< /Text>

After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I just had a LOT work done on my heating and air conditioning system and couldn't be more pleased. A fantastic job was done by John C. and Donald M. They were extremely courteous, efficient and patient in explaining what they were doing. It took them a couple of days to give you an idea of how much work I had done and not because they were slow. They worked quickly and expertly. They covered all the areas that they had to work in and when finished, you wouldn't even know they were there. Anderson Plumbing has several employees that I have had the need for service and they were ALL TOP QUALITY in what they had to do. These two men were even better than that. Anderson Plumbing is the way to go!!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>As always Anderson Plumbing sent out another terrific tech Ruben R researched the problem and was able to fix it in a timely manner.
We have had so many issues with plumbing and heating in one unit. All has been resolved very professionally. You are a great company there in San Diego. I'm glad that I saw one of your trucks outside of Home Depot on Sports Arena Blvd.and called.
Thank you

Dick Crandall was the representative that came to my house and gave me a bid, and explained to me exactly what  work was going to be done. Jacob and Adrian were the installers. They were professional, knowledgeable, and very courteous. They both possess great people skills. I was given a job time estimate of 3 days, but the guys were so proficient at their job, that they finished the whole job in only 2 days. There were also 2 other great young men that came out and did the electrical work for my heating& AC upgrade, and they also re-ducted my whole system. I am completely satisfied with the job. I am 100% satisfied with the whole Anderson team effort. I would recommend this company, and their great employees to anyone.< /Text>

My only problem is that overtime I get a check up - - mostly included with a VIP program purchase -- which is pre-paid under the program membership... well, they find something wrong and then it costs $$ to fix it.

It took two and a half days to complete the job and during that time we did not experience any major interruptions to our daily routine of caring for our eight month old granddaughter.  Donald was extremely courteous and very polite.  He always had a smile for our granddaughter and would let us know when and if we needed to go to an area of the house where there was less noise and dust in the air.  He would check with us if he had a question and keep us informed of the progress of the job. I can’t say enough good things about Donald. It was a pleasure to have him and his coworker in our home.

Anderson Plumbing is my new favorite plumbing company here is San Diego. I've used them twice now and have been happy both times. The office staff are courteous and helpful. Both times they sent someone right away even though it was not an emergency. Both technicians were so great. They made good future suggestions and fix the issue at hand quickly and gave us the best price possible. I actually have several plumbers in the family but in other states. With Anderson's nearby I no longer feel bad that my family plumbers are not around. Tim was so sweet to my mother (a bit of a talker) patiently listening to a story or two-LOL
Thank you Anderson's for making a bad plumbing situation into a pleasure! Susan</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air just installed a new heater and AC in our home.

1st, EVERYONE I came in contact with from Anderson was HAPPY, Friendly and appeared to enjoy the job.  Positive people make everything OK.

Our Sales Consultant Javier C was one of the only Sales people I remembered. We got several quotes.  He listened to me...I had a lot to say.  He was knowledgeable without throwing out all of the jargon from his industry.  Javier did not bug me...respected my space let me make decisions.  He did not manipulate our time.  He DID not bash his competitor.  He is sharp!  I did not feel like I was being ripped off.  Javier was honest.  Note: to Anderson competitor's bashing ones competition is a very unattractive tool to use, so stop it.

CLEAN no one looked like a worker.  One of gentlemen John C. very nice got his shirt dirty in our attack (who does not have a dirty attack) and let us know he was going to the truck to change it!  This group made me feel good about paying!  Another gentleman seen my darling dog get out and let me know even while my husband shushed him. Wonderful!

We had a water heater go out on a Sunday. James was quick and was able to help us make the right choices to replace our water heater and fix our situation in a timely manner. He is wonderful and worked with us to save us the most time and money.<//Review>

My husband, Russell and I were extremely pleased with the Customer Service we received from Brooks S..  Excellent Customer Service is almost unheard of anymore.
He answered both of our questions to the point where there were no questions left.  Both Brooks and Steve were very courteous.  There is no way that you can be paying them what they are worth.

We originally started with a new Water Heater with you and this was a return visit.

Thank you kindly,
Russell and Julie Oyler</text>

<review>Smelled gas coming from beneath our stove, which is very alarming. Shut off the valve underneath, aired out the kitchen, but hours later still smelled a bit of gas. Called something like 5 different plumbers asking for help as I have three young kids in the house and a wife who is due to have our fourth ANY MINUTE! Very much a serious situation. Despite this, every plumber I called either didn't respond or they were too busy to help. Then, I realized a family member recently used Anderson and she gave me the name and number of the actual technician that helped her out so I gave them a call and asked for James by name.  They appreciated how urgent this situation was, and James came out right away. He and his teammate arrived and were pleasant to work with from the start. They were always professional, and obviously experts at what they do. Throughout the entire process they communicated with us frequently so we always knew what was going on, what progress they've made, what their recommendations are, and what options we had. They were also very clear and direct with the costs associated with each option, and we never felt pressured into paying some exorbitant amount for optional services. They worked hard the entire time, being very sensitive to my family's particular situation. After the gas leak was fixed, James came back a few more times in the following days to do further tests to make absolutely certain things were done right and that everything was still holding up after they made the repairs. He even came out personally to meet with underground leak detection services (a third party), spoke to city gas company on our behalf to get our gas turned back on, and worked directly with the city inspectors office to get all the appropriate inspections and paperwork in order. Now, my family has gas service again! More importantly, this means we have a working clothes dryer, furnace, and HOT WATER. I could not have asked for a better experience in an otherwise really difficult situation.</review>< rating>

He explained in detail how the drains worked, where problems might occur and offered suggestions on ways to extend the life of some of our new fixtures.  Our plumbing problem is pretty extensive so he crawled under the house to identify the problem.  We had to clean up the sewage spill and he was able to recommend a company to do it before they could repair the damage.  In the end, they appeared to know their business inside and out and I felt comfortable using them.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Anderson Plumbing has completely unreasonable prices. Honestly, I really can't understand how they can have so many 5 star reviews unless people really don't care how much they pay for plumbing service.  Here are the facts of my case: I had a plumbing leak which they located for $262 when two other plumbers where quoting $130 for leak location.  I went with Anderson since they were the first to be able to come to my house.  After they found it they quoted $900 to repair a simple copper elbow. Another company quoted me a third the cost over the phone. Then came and fixed it in less than 30 mins.  It is sad to think some customers unfamiliar with plumbing rates trusting a company's quote as fair and paying literally $1800 per hour for a simple job, but if you go with Anderson be prepared for that sort of sticker shock.  Funny their tag line is "Nobody wows customers like we do."  Wow!< /text>

I called Anderson plumbing to replace a water heater. Their bid was $2100 for a simple 40 gallon in a garage. Don't use this company!!! Way too expensive! Twice as much as I ended up spending! He said it would take 1/2 a day...it took a better part of an hour! This company has inflated prices.<//text>

I think Larry did a great job; left the area clean, etc.  I have a problem being charged $220 and they refuse to give me a warranty.  Because I wouldn't pay $551 for a drain pop up assembly, they won't warranty the work!

Again, I don't blame the technician, but the company policy he is instructed and well-trained I might add to sell.  I saw through it, but needed by sink fixed.</text>

I had a plumbing leak.  Bernard came from Anderson PH&A.  He was on time.  He was very pleasant.  He was very smart and knew exactly what to do.  He finished the job promptly and cleaned up all mess.  It wasn’t cheap, but the quality was excellent.  I’d use him again.<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /gmapID><pics>None<//pics><Text>Mr Johnny Castro did a thorough maintenance in our AC. He did go to the attic to check the furnish. He did spend a lot of time checking the unit outside. Refrigerant is in low charge and added a solution  or something in the system (3.++ lbs). He also put some dye to the system for leak search and will follow through on a scheduled appointment on Aug 6, 2018. He will also come back on Sunday for the right size of the filter to put in.
In the past, last year when they installed the unit there were quite a bit of issues. There was a kind of leak in the system but did not do a leak search in particular to find where it's coming from.
So far today, we are pleased with what Mr. J. Castro had instituted. Job well done, thank you!
We are looking forward to solve this issue, and enjoy the rest of Summer months!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We have always had good results from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  If we had a complaint, it was always fixed right away.

Reggie came to our home to fix a plumbing problem we were having.  His work was impeccable on other items repaired; however, the repair on the flusher and flapper on the toilet needed a minor adjustment and that was taken care of the next day by another technician (Sorry, I do not know his name).

Reggie did find the equipment attached to the water heater to push hot water into the master bath had not been turned on.  He gave me instructions as to how it turns on and how to regulate the timer.  Not sure if it had ever been turned on since it was installed several years ago. It is working perfectly as the hot water comes in immediately.  We installed this equipment to save water instead of running the water ahead of time in order to take a warm shower.  I gave Reggie five stars as he went out of his way to show me how to regulate this equipment.  He went above and beyond.< /review>

We had a slow draining kitchen sink.   I hesitated calling a contractor, as many times in the past, we have had issues with calls not being returned.   This was certainly not the case with Anderson Plumbing.  I requested an appointment online, they called me shortly, and our appointment was set for that afternoon.  Larry called and said they could come earlier, which worked out great!  We also received an email with pictures of the technicians and said they were on their way.   We received a complete explanation of the work before they began and upon completing the job, Jimmy explained their findings and that our issue had been resolved.   Job well done!!!   I will never hesitate to call Anderson Plumbing if we ever have any plumbing issues in the future.   Thank you Larry & Jimmy!< /review>

The technician was punctual, courteous, clean and knowledgeable. He explained everything he found, gave us options for what we could do now, what needed done soon, and the pricing. We called and got a tech on the same day which was a blessing. We are very pleased with the speed of service and the technician they sent.< /Review>

Our garbage disposal was backing up every time we ran it on Thursday, Anderson plumbing was here the next day right after I called them.  Within two hours it was working like it should.  The tech gave good advise to have the drain pipes checked and Anderson Plumbing will follow up within the week.  What very good service.  I really appreciated the tech's answers as to the probable cause of the drainage problem.< /Review>

<Review>As always Anderson Plumbing sent out another terrific tech Ruben R researched the problem and was able to fix it in a timely manner.
We have had so many issues with plumbing and heating in one unit. All has been resolved very professionally. You are a great company there in San Diego. I'm glad that I saw one of your trucks outside of Home Depot on Sports Arena Blvd.and called.
Thank you

Larry was professional, knowledgable, and courteous from the moment I met him.  The plumbing problem he was called to address was complicated and  due to  poor design by the builder, not straight forward in its resolution.  Larry methodically attacked the problem, and kept me informed of his efforts as the job progressed.  It is rare that I have had a technician come into my home and earn my immediate trust. Larry is an outstanding ambassador for Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. Additionally, because of Larry,  I intend to call Anderson for future plumbing, heating and air conditioning difficulties at both my home and business. Thanks.</review>

<Text>I had the flow-tech device installed, and there’s a connection problem whenever I use the washing machine.  I have to unplug the device while using the washing machine.  When they installed the new furnace, they broke the doorknob on the back door.  I had the water heater flushed and the thermal expansion tank installed, and the water heater is making a dull thud when the toilet is flushed or the faucet is turned on.<//Text>< Rating>

The 2 installers that came to our house (Jacob B. & Maurcus C) were very nice and friendly.  They went above and beyond what was asked and kept us informed of everything being done through the entire project.  They made sure that we were completely satisified with the work before leaving.  I would recommend the company and these 2 installers as well.</Review>

We are always thrilled to see that our technicians are providing quality service and repairs to our customers.  Equally thrilled, when our clients spend their valuable time sharing their experiences.'}</resp><text>This was my first time contacting a plumbing company for a repair on my home and couldn't have been happier.  I really appreciated the upfront pricing - they explained this over the phone.  Eric T. arrived a few minutes earlier than expected and after hearing my explanation and looking at the PRV valve he knew that was the problem.  He also suggested replacing the main shutoff valve because of the age and I knew it was an honest recommendation and not just trying to sell additional services.  Eric did a great job with the repair and everything looked just as it did after he left, with the exception of a nice new pressure regulator valve.  I'd definitely use Anderson again!< /text></record>

I just had central air conditioning installed after living in my house through 21 years of hot summer heat. A group of young men named Joe Smithey, Brent Phillips, and Johnny Castro were the team of technicians who helped turn my house into a refrigerator.They were very courteous, knowledgeable, professional and hard working. The installation of my Lennox air conditioner went smoothly without any problems. If it weren't for the cold air coming out of the vent ducts, you couldn't tell that the unit was running. Impressive!</Text>

I was very pleased with the experience thanks to the expertise and proficient technician. He explained all the steps that was needed before he preformed  them and answered all my questions. This was very important to me because I know nothing about plumbing matters. He completed the job in the timeframe that he gave before he started the job. I am impressed and will recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air to all my friends and co-workers.</Review>

<Review>Our technician Junior was above and beyond what we expected. We’ve had bad experiences in the past with pushy sales and that didn’t happen today. Junior was extremely knowledgeable and explained the HVAC system is a manner we could understand without pushing us into a major purchase. The warranty Anderson Plumbing surpasses what other companies can do. Completely satisfied!! Highly recommend!! Don’t waste your time with anyone else.<//Review><Time>1533773615523<//Time>< gmapID>

Plumbing sucks but Anderson is awesome.  We had Anderson install a cleanout the last time our line backed up.  This time Dylan came out within an hour and really took his time to make sure I was correct about the problem.  Then he cleared the lines, cleaned everything and made triple sure that everything was working great before he left.  Plumbing, especially sewage is very stressful, Dylan's, here to help you, attitude was so refreshing.<//review>

<Text>Junior (technician) came to our home to evaluate our non functioning furnace. He was here several hours, and did great work in figuring out the problems, by replacing burned out circuit boards and other parts.  When he left the furnance was working.  He was concerned that something else might have been wrong. He called back in a few hours to check on its functioning, and by that time, it was not working correctly.  He had suggested we consider evaluating the need for a new furnance, since we were replacing so many parts.  We greatly appreciate his honesty and helpfulness with our whole situation.  We did in fact, talk to an Anderson advisor the next day, which helped us make the correct decision in replacing the furnace and original duct work.  We were unaware that the duct work was inefficient, and appreciated the information.
We now have a new furnace, with new duct work, which already appears to be more economical for us.
Thank you Anderson for employing great employees, like Junior, who was professional, courteous and very knowledgeable.</Text>< response>

Rudy came by and spent two hours trying to properly diagnose the problem. We had had issues with our heater since last year and both times we had another company come out they gave a quick look and a huge invoice, but neither time were they correct on the issue. I was extremely impressed the the availability, and professionalism of the technician as well as the staff at Anderson Plumbing and Heating.< /review>

I called Anderson Plumbing to repair a bathroom sink drain that was leaking.  I also had several small plumbing related jobs that I really did not want to do myself so I decided to have them perform this work in addition to the repair.  I had never contacted a plumbing service before and decided on Anderson Plumbing because they have been in business for so long and had a great rating with the BBB.  I can honestly say that it was a pleasure working with this company.  The phone representatives are polite and courteous.  The technician showed up on time, treated my home with care, and conducted himself in a professional manner.  The visit started with a walk through and discussion about the work to be performed, some Q&A, full disclosure of the charges (the forms they use are very detailed), and lastly a time estimate to complete the work.  The plumber, Reggie, did a wonderful job.  When he finished we performed another walk-through to review the repairs.  He answered all of my questions and provided some helpful tips.  I would definitely use this company again.</Text>

<text>We were in a crisis with an unsuccessful attempt to snake our kitchen drain.
James arrived when they said he would; he was very professional, putting on booties over his work shoes to protect our carpet. He explained everything he could do, and the cost, etc.
Our problem was resolved well and I think my husband and I feel a little more educated about our own plumbing issues which are unique as the kitchen had been remodeled by the prior owner. Needless to say, the owner had made several errors!
We'll definitely use Anderson again!

We called Anderson Plumbing because we had a slab leak.  Erik Egerstrom,  the plumbing technician came out in a timely manner.  He spent a lot of time looking for the leak and explaining everything to us.  He recommended that we call a leak detection company, which we did.  He followed up with us, and came out to give us a quote on repair.  He worked with us on pricing and was very professional and honest about what we needed and didn't need.  When he came to do the work, he and his apprentice got here at 9:30 AM and worked until 10:30 PM  because he wanted to make sure we had water for the weekend.  He then followed up after the weekend and finished the rest of the work.  Erik was professional, very knowledgeable and best of all honest!!  The drywaller and office staff were wonderful as well.  Thank you Anderson!!</review>

<Text>We have used Bernard on several occasions, the latest being last week.  He is always very professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  Very trust worthy - you do not feel like you've been taken.  Anderson Plumbing guarantees its work and it is a pleasure doing business with it and its employees.  Thankfully we now have a great plumbing company we can trust and feel good about calling whenever we have plumbing problems.

Thank you very much!

Professional. Friendly. No problems. They did a good job and answered all my questions. I had a hot water shut off valve for my kitchen sink that broke. Reggie came in, replaced the valve, and installed my new kitchen faucet sink in less than an hour. The same job would have taken me all day. He answered all my questions and left with a job well done.</Text>

I have received excellent services with very knowledgeable technicians. I'd like to say THANK YOU Jesse Salcido for your great service to unclog my drain.

I just had central air conditioning installed after living in my house through 21 years of hot summer heat. A group of young men named Joe Smithey, Brent Phillips, and Johnny Castro were the team of technicians who helped turn my house into a refrigerator.They were very courteous, knowledgeable, professional and hard working. The installation of my Lennox air conditioner went smoothly without any problems. If it weren't for the cold air coming out of the vent ducts, you couldn't tell that the unit was running. Impressive!<//Review>

I have used the services of Anderson for over 10 years and always recommend them.

Ron, the plumber was great! . I told him the property was in the middle of selling and we needed this I spection for the buyers today. We had requested a non intrusive camera scope to verify if there was a leak or moisture inside the wall. When he walked in empty handed I asked if he had the camera with him, he replied no, then I went off and reacted terribly.  Even though I was a l irrate, he remained calm.  I told him the owner specifically requested it when she ordered them to come out.  He immediately called his office to see what the issue was and found out that for some reason, whomever took the appointment did not put that in the call notes.
He calmly recommended some options of cutting into the wall and what that cost would be, or would have to wait until the plumber with the scope could be scheduled. We decided to remove a piece of drywall ourselves so he could look in and he thoroughly inspected the area visually and what he couldn't see he stuck his arm in the wall to feel around for any water or dampness. He was gracious the entire time and explained everything so clearly and calmed me down.  He also wrote up the findings on his tablet and emailed it directly to us while he was still on site. What a fantastic man and employee you have!  Sincerely, Denise Lisa, the owners realtor. I will definitely recommend your company to all of my clients. However please make sure your schedulers understand what the client is asking for, what type of plumber they need and write everything the customer requested, verbatim, in the remarks!</text>

<text>All staff I talked to were very professional and quick to respond, however prices are out of line.  I was quoted over $800 to repair a leaking toilet valve (they called it a "rebuild").   I could not afford that so called another plumber who was highly recommended.  He came right out, fixed it in less than an hour and charged me $184.

I called Anderson Plumbing because they had a discount rate for Air Conditioning check up.  I expected them to try to sell me a new one because mine is about 10 years old.  My Service Specialist was Javier. He was professional and friendly. He explained what he would do and why.  He checked out everything, and I could see that he knew what he was doing.  He checked out the unit inside and changed the filters and even vacuumed out the closet it was enclosed in.(it was really dusty)  He finished by installing a booster to the unit to get a few more years out of it.  I could tell the difference immediately!  I will continue to use this Company for all of my future needs. I felt that they are knowledgable and honest, and I will ask for Javier because he exceeded my expectations.</text>

I had to have a follow on appointment for the next day and Larry F. arrived and corrected the problem within the required 3 hours as he said he would. Both toilets are working and I could not even tell that a plumber had spent 3 hours in the bath rooms. I would highly recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air and Larry F.< /review><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Had problem with a toilet wobbling and leaking water from under base.  Problem was caused by previous plumber incorrectly setting a new toilet in place by trying to use two wax seals to make up for the flange being lower and not flush with the finished tile floor level.  Alex installed a new flange, level with the finished floor, and a new wax seal and then set the new toilet in place, using shims to eliminate any wobbling, and finally caulked around the entire base.  Alex was professional, courteous, and explained fully what he had to do, what the cost would be before he proceeded, then did the work and thoroughly cleaned up after himself when the work was completed.  will certainly use the company again if and when the need arises.< /review>< pictures>

Fernando Gonzalez  was the technician who provided the plumbing service for us. He was prompt and arrived in the time period promised. He did a fantastic job and cleaned up after he was finished. he explained  the service and charges in detail pefore proceeding.
Fernando has provided us with service before so we ask for him whenever possible. We are long time customers of Anderson plumbing. Fernando is the reason we always take advantage of their services.</review>

Ken Slater was very knowledgeable and helpful! He explained the problem so we could understand the issues and provided options on how to fix the problem! He explained the installation and why some items had to be added to pass inspection. He installed the new water heater and cleaned up very well afterword. Ken answered all the questions we had so we could understand them.</Review>

<UserId.>102028627427651721886< /UserId.><name>Giovanna Thomas< /name><Time>1542905571324< /Time><rate>4<//rate><text>I used Anderson for their plumbing services and I was satisfied with that work.  Despite being over priced, I liked both of the technicians who came to my house.  However, I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with HVAC services that I received.  The technician came to my house and instead of assessing all possible options (which I later learned there were other, cheaper options), he went straight to the $1300 blower motor option, which knowing nothing about HVAC, I figured that was what was needed.  The technician installed the blower motor and it worked for less than 24 hours.  Anderson came back and this time brought back a salesman who tried to pressure me into spending 9-10 THOUSAND dollars on a completely new system.  I felt very uncomfortable about the sales tactics and I could tell that my technician was also uncomfortable.  Eventually the salesperson left and the technician agreed to try a simple remedy, adding refrigerant to the system.  They were originally going to try to charge me $200 for this, but decided to spare me the expense.  The system worked for only a few hours.  I eventually changed the outlet and that got the system working for a couple of weeks.

It broke again, and after talking to other professionals in the area and my family friend back at home about it, they explained that I was completely ripped off and completely overcharged for something that failed to work.  They also explained that the prices that they were quoting me for a new system were completely absurd.  I feel completely taken advantage of; the company realized that my spouse and I were not savvy in the HVAC realm and they pounced on the opportunity to make as much money from us as possible.

I ultimately hired a new professional to fix my broken system and they explained that the motor that was installed by Anderson had already broke and also that there were other fixes to try prior to replacing the blower motor originally.  I tried to get some or all of my money back from Anderson, but they were very difficult to reach, have given me the runaround, and refuse to do anything because I did not give them the opportunity to fix the problem.  I explained that I know that they took advantage of me and that I was uncomfortable with their sales tactics and they just choose to slander the professional that I used to fix the problem and try to affix the blame on me in any way possible.

If you cannot tell, I am completely dissatisfied with the assistance that I received from Anderson and I will never use them ever again and will be sure to tell anyone who will listen to never use them again.  They just want your money and will pretend to be helpful and charming in an attempt to get you to trust them and spend all kinds of money on things that you do not need.

While searching for another plumbing company, their name came up and I saw the good reviews so I decided to check it out. They had a 49 dollar internet special for camera inspection and drain cleaning, but a little out of my area, so there was a 41 dollar extra charge. Appointment was immediate and Tim showed up early in the morning, did his magic and viola, everything was functional. He didn't have the camera with him so he gave me a free camera inspection coupon along with some other specials. I am more than happy for their prompt service and no hidden charges, affordable charge with everything was disclosed, like how much it will be (total was $91 as opposed to 240 dollars that Roto Rooters was giving me the estimate for) . I would highly recommend them.< /Text>

I am so glad I had Anderson Plumbing , Heating & Air service my air conditioner. The Technician was respectful and clean and knew his product very well.

What I really appreciated was they offered a service and did just that. I mean I was not told I needed all these extra parts or service from Quentin the tech who came to work on my air conditioner.

You really love it when you do not feel pressure nor feel you're being scammed.

Anyway love, love this company will definitely use them again.

Kind Regards

<review>I called Anderson Plumbing because they had a discount rate for Air Conditioning check up.  I expected them to try to sell me a new one because mine is about 10 years old.  My Service Specialist was Javier. He was professional and friendly. He explained what he would do and why.  He checked out everything, and I could see that he knew what he was doing.  He checked out the unit inside and changed the filters and even vacuumed out the closet it was enclosed in.(it was really dusty)  He finished by installing a booster to the unit to get a few more years out of it.  I could tell the difference immediately!  I will continue to use this Company for all of my future needs. I felt that they are knowledgable and honest, and I will ask for Javier because he exceeded my expectations.< /review><rating>5</rating><resp>None</resp><username>Linda Woods</username><Time>1400348553896< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</Gmap_id>< user_id>

Just now wrapping up the installation of a completely new HVAC system. These guys were one of three  companies to quote us and by far the least professional,  knowledgeable, and affordable. When Paul  came and to take a look at our systen back in April for a quote,  he immediately said he had never seen one as old as ours and didn't know what to do.  Old? Yes.  Not knowing what to do even when you are the expert? Not a good thing.  His recommendation was to ask my neighbors (who just got theirs replaced) what they did and then call him back. Needless to say,  I was livid. Once pressed, he emailed me with an estimate on something he "thought" would work for over $12,000. So, beyond the horrible service and lack of professionalism, they were also really overpriced. I went with a different, extremely well rated family owned company who was literally HALF the cost; same quality system and similar warranty; and knew immediately what to do when they saw our outdated system. I can't speak to their other services, however I would strongly recommend NOT using this company for HVAC needs.</Text>

<review>Ryan was our technician, he arrived early, explained to us what the cost would be.  He had our problem fixed in a matter of minutes.  We have been searching for a plumber and heating and air company for about 6 months. I am so happy we found Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. We will be using them for all of plumbing, heating and air.

Finding a company who cares about the service they perform these days is very rare.  Anderson is that company.</review>< user_name>

<Review>Contacted Anderson Plumbing for a slab leak. Brian was the tech that came out, and he gave us a recommendation and the cost. Did a copper re-rout that led to the kitchen. A week later another copper pipe leak showed up in a different area. Requested that Brian come back out to investigate. Found a pin hole leak in the copper pipe which he spot repaired to stop the leak. Based on the two leaks we discussed a full copper re-pipe of the house. We decided to go this route as we have been spared of water damage up to this point. We requested that Brian do the work. Brian does excellent work. He plans things out, does not rush, keeps the house clean by using plastic around the work area, and makes sure we have use of some running water while replacing the old piping. At this time (because all the plumbing was being disconnected) we replaced a toilet  and some tub and shower valves. This was a big job and we appreciate Brian's dedication. If by chance some plumbing needs to be done in the future I will request Brain as the one to repair it.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>Drina was excellent tech in doing HVAC checkup. She's conscientious and relentless.

Anderson's will be returning, because they were unable to resolve one problem today. One anticipates that their depth of talent will enable them to identify the right person rapidly and be able to schedule quickly, since it's a follow-up and it's taking a good bit of extra customer time.

The one surprising thing is that Anderson is retro in their communications. They rely on telephone as if it's in the 1980s. Even when requested to use email, they use very little of it. This is a costly problem for those customers who have businesses, for example, and can readily multitask with emails, but are unable to justify the various costs imposed by unnecessary phone calls. Hopefully they'll be updating this aspect of their vital customer service focus.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</GmapID></record>

The plumber could not tell us what was wrong with the toilet, he just said it needed replacing of a cost of $958.  The other company we went with replaced a $20 part.

I would highly recommend Anderson to any one who needs service.  My AC was not working properly.  I called for a service appointment on a Friday, so I knew there would be something of a wait.  Wednesday Michael G. came to my house at the time I was told.  He asked me what the problem was and then he checked the equipment.  He was friendly and explained in detail what was wrong with my unit and how he was planning to fix it.  I appreciate all the info he gave me and the professional manner he used.</Text>

<review>Larry was very courteous, answered my questions and tried to trouble shoot the problem.    He was on time, respected my property.  What he did not do was remove the trap.  I did not ask him to but when he ran water and could not reproduce the back up of water in the sink, he might have thought of that.  I thought of it later the night and asked the next person who looked at the sink when it backed up again to do that.  We found a child's toothbrush which had obviously been in there for some time.  I am not faulting him but the next time I would definitely make sure the trap be removed from a sink that is backing up.

I also had Zak B. out for the same problem.  Again he ran water, tried to reproduce the blockage.  We went over everything that had been done the day before, we checked the clean out on the side of the building and then I asked him to remove the trap on the sink.  He did and we found a child's toothbrush in the trap.  Again if I had not asked to have it removed the problem would have recurred.  I am happy I asked but I think the technician should know to remove a trap if they can't reproduce the blockage with running water.  Something has to be causing the sink to backup several times.<//review>< resp>

< Review>
Called Anderson Plumbing at 8:30am, was promised a plumber would be here between noon and 4:00pm.  Ricardo and Jesse arrived at 1:30pm, about 20 minutes after a phone call from the office that they were on their way.
These guys were great.  Very professional, and, with an added benefit, fun and informative.  Had a written estimate within a few minutes of their arrival after a survey of the problem.
Job was competently completed in about an hour and the job site left perfectly clean.
Will always call Anderson to work on any of our future household plumbing issues.</Review>

< review>
I called Anderson to have a broken disposer replaced. Calling the job in already a great experience - ''How can I make you smile today?'' just works! Scheduling was without problems and I got called 30 minutes before the technician arrived. Justin M. impressed me right away, because he listened to my problem description, then assessed the work involved, presented me with the options available. I chose, he did the rest - a sizable job as it turned out. In-between and after having finished, he warned me that, perhaps, another unrelated problem might arise in the near future. He counseled me on the work to be done, if that were the case. Justin explained everything very well. He also asked me if there were other problems and, on me mentioning one, he took care of it. The parts that he needed were on the Anderson truck - they are fully stocked as the advertisement says. Justin left the job site clean and tidy. The part that he had mentioned might be on the brink of failure actually did fail a few hours later. I called it in, the time was set and Justin took care of the rusted out part the next day, same time. No fuzz, no huff and puff, Anderson and Justin just did it. I had used this company before, and was happy, but it has gotten even better!</review>

<name>Daniel Chong<//name><review>The technician did a good job on explaining work and cost , and and the work execution as well. He cleaned up nicely after done. However, the price was a real shock for me. Anderson charges by job, not by hourly. The job was categorized as cat 8 of 3" cleanout. The real work was replacing a fall-off 1 foot long 3" drainage pipe connector. The entire work was done just about little over 2 hours. I was charged $1149.40. I am not sure that this is a normal charge or I was just rubbed.< /review><gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>With sluggish drains, the fear of water backing up was a real threat. I was extremely happy when Dylan cleared our drains and scheduled a camera scope appointment, which was completed today by Miguel. And we are finally (literally) getting to the root of the problem -- roots in the drain line is the problem. Next step is a resolution. Everyone has been very professional.

Start out knowing a plumber won't be cheap and there will be some difficulty arranging for the plumber to come when it is convenient for you. Once you are past that, Anderson PHA was great! Ryan (drains) and Ken (plumber) were both courteous, friendly, professional, competent, and very loyal to Anderson PHA. A positive experience having them repair our drains and fix an outdoor faucet (and a pressure problem).</Text>

my appointment was between 8-12 and I received a phone call at 7:15 saying the tech would be here in an hour.  Ken S arrived exactly on time, wore booties in my house, explained the problem to me, and did a very professional job on repairing my toilet.  He left my bathroom as clean as it was, and told me about a coupon I could use for the service call since I am a repeat customer and happened to have one.  He was very nice and also showed me how to reconnect the chrome dishwasher vent that had become unscrewed on my kitchen counter.  It was a very good experience, and this is why I always use Anderson.</Text>

Let's get this out of the way first.  The service was just fine.  However like with all trades they have gotten out of wack with the Amount they charge you.  Knowing more people aren't going to tackle plumbing or electrical issues  doesn't give them the opportunity to gouge the customer.  All i needed was a trap under the sink replaced. 20 dollars maybe in materials.  Yet I got charged $372 for 15 min. job.   Shameful...again Anderson plumbing isn't the only one but would be nice if they stepped up to the plate and maybe be a step above the rest!< /Text>

Called about a toilet and the day they were to come the other toilet started leaking so when George P. got here he ended up changing both. He was very polite and professional about it and this is the only plumbing company I have used for years and will continue to use.</Review>

< review>
I Have a 5 year old central AC system that kicks out cold air fine, but have had problems with occasional water dripping from above. CJ ( technician) arrived at the 1PM requested time and immediately began his diagnosis of the problem. Within 10 minutes he figured out the problem (which was two-fold) and began the fix. After a time on the roof to check out and adjust the system, be began the repair inside.
His cleaning of the main drain hose from the air exchanger and the hose below to the drain was completed successfully. All is now Good!

As a side note, I've been in business successfully for a number of years.  I was very impressed with my technician (CJ).  He is a remarkable individual on two levels.  He has extraordinary people skills combined with very strong technical ability.  That's an excellent combination that's difficult to find in employees today!</review>

<review>They used to be my go to company great people  but recently took an estimate from them which is $6000 more than the actual work performed by another licensed plumber. Now I wonder if I went with another company last year to do my sewer lines, I could have saved at least 4000. But I learnrf  this time to get three other estimates. Sorry Anderson you have great people. But way too expensive!

UPDATE!!! Got an email today, they reviewed the quote and dropped it from $6900 to $4951 after I posted this review.  I got other estimates a lot lower for exactly same work, with liability insurance, worksmen's comp coverage and same credentials for $1786.00 .  I really like your people Anderson Plumbing, but your company charges too much.  Last year you charge me over $7000 for sewer repairs which could have only cost me $3500 according to the company I hired to do the work recently in my home.  Thank you for having great staff but your company is OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.<//review>< Rate>

A shout out to Anderson PHA, and their technician James B.  We had a plumbing back-up on Christmas morning as my luck would have it.  I called Anderson and to offset my bad luck they thankfully sent James B. to the house.  I don't have appropriate vocabulary to commend James B. His appearance, knowledge, service and professionalism was beyond my highest expectations. His respect for my property was as if it was his own home. Clean equipment and well thought out procedures had the problem solved in only minutes. Adequate equipment and solid procedures.  Thank you James B.  Anderson PHA ... you have a great employee.< /text>

<Time>1532397912039</Time><rating>1</rating><Review>So, our central house air conditioning packed up yesterday. We were very keen to have it repaired quickly so we used homeadvisor to find local contractors. Anderson arrived about 3:10 today and prepared a quote of $1811 to replace an $18 capacitor!!!  Scandalous, egregious or what?  We found a local contractor (Air Time) shortly afterwards, they arrived within less than two hours of our first contact, repaired the system in 10 minutes, and for less than 10% of the price i.e. $180. They (Air Time) were amazing. If you care about your money, do yourself a favor and call someone else.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1532450353673, 'text': "Thank you Mr. Walley  for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with our quote for repairs of your air conditioner. As no company wants to get a bad review, we do want to know about our clients experiences. I was able to pull Graham's service call and I found that we provided same day service, even though we were booked due to the number of calls coming in at this time. Our technician detected the issue with the system, and provided an upfront quote for repairs. Our technician actually did not quote $1811.00 for only a capacitor replacement, but along with 3 other repairs and our service fee. We are glad that the problem was fixed, however our recommendations did include other items that would keep the system running more effectively, not just a quick fix. If Graham would like to contact us and discuss the matter further or have a field manager out to go over the recommendations in more detail, we would be happy to schedule at his convenience.\nThank you,\nAnderson PHA\nErin Hanson, Client Care Manager\n619-449-3852 x445"}< /response><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//GmapID></record>

Let's get this out of the way first.  The service was just fine.  However like with all trades they have gotten out of wack with the Amount they charge you.  Knowing more people aren't going to tackle plumbing or electrical issues  doesn't give them the opportunity to gouge the customer.  All i needed was a trap under the sink replaced. 20 dollars maybe in materials.  Yet I got charged $372 for 15 min. job.   Shameful...again Anderson plumbing isn't the only one but would be nice if they stepped up to the plate and maybe be a step above the rest!<//review>

< Review>
Tried Anderson Plumbing, Heating, and Air for the first time. Having only one full bath, it was a bit of an emergency when the shower wouldn't drain, and dripping faucets were rapidly filling the shower stall. Technician James, attempted to clear the blockage, but only got 2 feet into the drain. After informing him of old cast iron pipes in the crawl space beneath our house, he called a camera specialist, Ricardo, to determine the problem. We needed a new trap and 10 foot length of modern-day "code" pipe. James was able to temporarily stop the dripping faucets. Unfortunately, we weren't able to schedule the fix-up for a week later.

One week later: Larry, a very knowledgeable man with plenty of on-the-job experience, and a supervisor as well, arrived about 8:30 AM (on time), fully explained all of the work that was to be done, and answered all of our questions. Then he went right to work. The beneath the house work was accomplished pretty quickly, but the new, Moen, single handle faucet kit was a bit of a challenge. Larry had to remove an area of tile, and saw through 2-inch concrete and lathe in our "vintage" shower stall. When the job was completed (by mid-afternoon), the shower drained well (with its modern, 4 inch pipe), and we had a shiny Moen faucet/plate and shower head. They were so well-installed that one couldn't tell that they were replacements. No damage to the existing tile and well-sealed.

On the same-day that James and Ricardo came out, (at different times), I was only charged $42. Ricardo prepared the cost, with options. In my opinion, the fee for the option that I chose, was fair, considering the time, labor, and parts involved. On repair day, no attempt to oversell, no surprises. My white tiled bathroom was left clean, and undamaged. Larry even wore shoe covers to protect my dark hardwood floors and oriental rugs where he had to pass through the house.

I definitely will call Anderson again for its caring, knowledgeable, experienced, professional service for plumbing repairs on my OLD house. Thank you, James, Ricardo, and Larry.<//Review>

Sorry for the duplicate, but I think I posted this on a site that feeds into Google.
WARNING! Outrageous prices. Confusing and complicated fee schedule with “up front pricing” (Stupid me, for not reading the reviews before calling them.) I discovered a slight leak from one of the toilet tank bolts. I checked online to see what needed to be done (remove tank & bolts, sandpaper the hole, replace). The cost of the bolt & gasket kit online, $8.55. Instead of DIY I called Anderson. I told the plumber there was a leak from the bolt…I guess he took a look at me and thought, “female, old, dumb”, or else the plumbers are pushed to upsell. He said, “oh no, it’s leaking from, etc….” I told him to put his finger on the left bolt and feel the water. I didn’t need or want anything else because I had just a few weeks previously changed out the “innards” of the tank. So he quoted me…$657.00! A rip-off. We hassled over the price (I really should have just asked him to leave). After “calling his manager”, the price was reduced because I didn’t need a “full tank rebuild”, which I never asked for. I still was overcharged. Less than an hour work, plus a $8.55 part. He tried to impress me that I was getting a 2-year warranty (on a $8.55 part).
Their fees are based on 9 levels, with a price for each individual item in each level. As an example, for the work I myself did previously: In level 2: toilet flapper, plus a tank trip lever. My cost $38.00 online, plus 5 minutes of work. Their level 2 pricing: Flapper $269; Trip lever $269 = $458. As I said…beware.< /Text>

The person who answered said that there’s availability in the afternoon. I said Ok and said if I need to cancel, I will call because I initially wanted another company that I trust to fix the AC but they were booked all day and not sure if they could come the same day. Since Anderson charges $68 just to come I called to cancel the appointment but the person who answered said that they would not charge additional fee and it will go towards the repair. So I said ok, hoping they would be reasonable. The repair man named JUNIOR arrived and looked at the AC and took about 2 minutes and said the unit was “unfixable” and need to replace and it would cost about $10k-20k. My mother is in her old age and she wanted it to be fixed at least temporarily until she could replace it( add a coolant/ Freon) We could clearly see that he did not want to even try fixing and had a really bad attitude. then he said to do that there’s no guarantee and there can be a leak, etc, etc.. trying to sell a new one. Then he said it will cost $1850 to just add Freon to fix it temporarily or if you don’t want him to do that for that amount to pay $ 68 for coming. We’ve fixed our AC units in our homes and never paid more than $300-$400. This man was so unreasonable and cruel. He insisted that We pay him $68 for 2 minutes he took to look at it and try to scam my old aged mom. So we did pay $68 and let him go. We got the other company to come the same day and fix the AC with the coolant and charged only $300 and the AC is working fine. I am so angry that this man from this “reputable” company is scamming people trying to sell their AC units and giving unreasonable, unreal quotes so they rob money from people.

UPDATE: A few days later we contacted Anderson customer service and told them what happened, they refunded the $68. They agreed that it was unprofessional and not how they train their employees.</review>< pictures>

I have used this company for years and always been very satisfied with their service. Most recently Eric Teran came out to do a number of things at once: replace faucets, put in a new toilet with a washlet, and remove an RO unit. He was friendly, professional, and gave us clear information about the products. The work was done efficiently and neatly.<//review>

<review>my appointment was between 8-12 and I received a phone call at 7:15 saying the tech would be here in an hour.  Ken S arrived exactly on time, wore booties in my house, explained the problem to me, and did a very professional job on repairing my toilet.  He left my bathroom as clean as it was, and told me about a coupon I could use for the service call since I am a repeat customer and happened to have one.  He was very nice and also showed me how to reconnect the chrome dishwasher vent that had become unscrewed on my kitchen counter.  It was a very good experience, and this is why I always use Anderson.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

DO NOT USE! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT WILLING TO HELP!

Called for bathroom double sink back up and guy shows up. He then says he forgot the main tool in Escondido. He comes back and breaks snake cable off in the drain, but the sink "Should still work." I need to pay him $142, he leaves and I check bathroom and 1 inch of nasty smelly black water is in tub, where I set all my stuff from under the counter. I had to call him back and all my stuff was dirty. He said someone needed to come out with a camera on Friday morning. So now I can't use my master bathroom at all. New guy "specialist" comes Friday morning, never gets a tool out and tells me he doesn't need to because he knows what it needs. Off his head, with no calculator, he says it will be about $2700 because they need to cut up my walls now. I tell him he needs to write up an estimate and I will get a second opinion. Writes it up for $2400 and tells me he's "Hooking me up." I let him leave and call 2nd plumber. Guy comes and says he can't do anything with Anderson's broken parts in the line. Trying to make sure so I don't get forgot about for the weekend, I leave several messages, and I FINALLY get to talk to a manager at 4:49 on Friday night. He tells me they have no liability for breaking their cable off in my line and leaving it there. He is rude an condescending - I wish I had never heard of these people and I hope to spare someone else the same hassle.</Text>

<Date>1513902257545</Date><Response>{'time': 1513976040509, 'text': 'Good afternoon Ms. Cummins,\nMy name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air. I first want to thank you for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your service. I did receive your concern from our CSR regarding we hadn\'t shown up as of 5pm last night. I was able to pull up your account and confirm via our phone recordings, that you called for service on Tuesday at 3pm, and were scheduled for service Thursday in our pm slot. Which was explained that we would arrive anytime after 12pm. You confirmed this was ok with you as we were booked at that time. I do sincerely apologize that we did not have anything sooner at that time, and that our scheduling time frames were not satisfactory. We recently changed our windows of scheduling due to our technicians were often delayed on jobs- therefore we would be late for the next clients window. We have found that giving an "am" appointment, arriving before 12pm, and a "pm" appointment arriving after 12pm enables us to not be late for appointments. We do keep our clients updated half way through the morning or afternoon, as well as call them 30-45 minutes prior to arriving. This enables our clients to go on about their day and not have to wait at home for us to arrive.\nI do see that we offered you an afterhours appointment, but that was declined due to the service fee was higher. I do wish I was made aware of this concern at that time, I would have honored our regular fee for you. We by no means want our clients sitting in a cold home waiting for service. And after listening to your explanation of the problem- I too believe it was a relatively simple fix. Also, I would like you to know that our technicians run calls 24 hours a day, and can work in the darkest of areas- Again I wish this was discussed with you before hand so maybe we could have kept your appointment last night and gotten this taken care of for you before you had to leave.\nIf  this has not been taken care of, or you have questions or further concerns- please call me directly and I will do my best to get you immediate service.\nSincerely,\nErin Hanson\nClient Care Manager\nAnderson PHA\n619-449-3852 x445\nerinh@andersonpha.com'}< /Response><user_id>117108153971290335424</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Thankfully we haven't had the need for a plumber often but when we do I'm glad that we found Anderson Heating, Air, and Plumbing.  Their techs are always clean and professional.  Our latest experience was actually 3 jobs for them that snowballed into another problem so while the bill was more than we expected the tech explained everything he needed to do and why and cleaned up after he was finished.  We have never had a bad experience with them but I would bet if we did they would try and make us happy.  The tech that we had today was Eric T. and he was awesome!!!  Again we've never had a bad experience with them but they can send Eric to my house every time if they want to.  Thanks<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

<Text>Our A/C died on July 2nd. Normally I wouldn't be in a rush to fix it but my wife was delivering our first child on July 7.  I called 3 other companies before contacting Anderson. 2 of those companies never returned my call and the third couldn't meet our schedule demand. I needed the AC fixed by July 6th.  Anderson stepped up and squeezed us in. Mike our tech was fast, professional, and knowledgeable.  Thanks for helping us being a new born back to a cool house.

< Review>
I Have a 5 year old central AC system that kicks out cold air fine, but have had problems with occasional water dripping from above. CJ ( technician) arrived at the 1PM requested time and immediately began his diagnosis of the problem. Within 10 minutes he figured out the problem (which was two-fold) and began the fix. After a time on the roof to check out and adjust the system, be began the repair inside.
His cleaning of the main drain hose from the air exchanger and the hose below to the drain was completed successfully. All is now Good!

As a side note, I've been in business successfully for a number of years.  I was very impressed with my technician (CJ).  He is a remarkable individual on two levels.  He has extraordinary people skills combined with very strong technical ability.  That's an excellent combination that's difficult to find in employees today!<//Review>

When the tech came out , he gave my wife three options varying in price from $3640 for refrigerant test and repair  to replacement of system for $12.087.00. A suction line they were asking $394.00 for has a cost of approximately $35.00. Further he told me and written on his proposal that the compressor was not working and needed to be replaced.

As it turned out, I did not need a compressor and our freon leak was repaired. ALL for a TOTAL of $701.00. !!!!!!</Text></record>

Starting this review and will make sure to update it upon service completion.  I was truly amazed by the level of customer service I received when calling in to inquire about service for the drain line of our air unit.  The previous company was not responsive and could not answer my questions when I called, but wanted to schedule me three weeks in the future and mentioned they couldn't tell me what the problem was until they got a technician to the property.  They told me they would have a technician call me back and .....NO CALL BACK.  Within minutes of asking the same questions to Anderson, they got Robert on the phone with me.  He was able to explain the issue we were having based on the information I gave them, and they were able to get me in their schedule within a couple business days.  Great job thus far Anderson!  In a day and age of instant gratification you all should pat each other on the back for having an outstanding customer on-boarding process in place.  More to come after the service visit on Monday!< /text>

<text>I sign up for VIP membership September 2017 and yesterday I had an emergency sewer back up problem. I called the Anderson plumbing and the lady O talked to could not even tell me a timeline when can a technician can call me beck to determine the timeline they can come over to fix my sewage back up problem. Finally one hour plus the technician called me and stated that they could not respond until 3 hours later around 5:30 PM- I said ok because it's fourth of July- but when I tried calling another plumbing company (Roto-Rooter) they were consistent with the timeline- even the representative told me that the technician will call me in 15 minutes they the technician show up in my front door and able to clear my mainline sewage by accessing my clean out in less than an hour. I called again for the Anderson plumbing to come in just to place a camera and do a Plumbers Report- at first the guy told me it's $270 and when I told him I want a report to show to the city the price went up to $490 and the first available is not until three weeks later 24July2018. What a waste of VIP membership. This place sucks with all the good reviews above failed to response when I needed the most. This should say a lot when you have to chose your next plumbing project or problems.

<resp>{'time': 1530905589998, 'text': '***RESOLVED*** We were able to provide Mr. Roque with the necessary information for him to contact the city regarding his issue. Thank you Mr. Roque for working with me to get this taken care of for you. We hope that your situation gets handled, please let us know if there is anything further you need.\n\nThank you Mr. Roque for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your call out to us. My name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson PHA. I was able to pull up your account and research the details. First I would like to apologize that we were not able to get out to you sooner, we were very busy due to the Holiday, and we sincerely apologize that you had to call another company out. We are very glad I was an easy clearing for you. Our intentions are to be able to get to every client that needs us, unfortunately that isn\'t the case always.\nI also was able to get information on the estimate given for the camera and report requested. Our normal camera charge is $250.00, and an additional fee to place findings on a flash drive for your records. However, when a client needs a "Plumbers Report" there is more to just the camera-ing of the line. Because the city will not take the report from a homeowner, only a licensed plumber- our technicians have to camera the line, place the findings on a disc, write up an official findings report, take these to the city and file the report along with their form- this is why the price increased. I was also informed that the city will not do anything regarding roots in the line, corrosion or build up. There has to actually be a break, or collapse in the line for them to come out and repair/replace. If the line is able to be hydro-jetted to clear out roots or buildup- they will expect the homeowner to take care of this at their expense. I hope this gives a little more insight to your concern. I know it doesn\'t help that we were not available sooner to come out, please call me directly if you have another issue and I will work directly with a technician for you.\n\nSincerely,\nErin Hanson\nClient Care Manager\n619-449-3852\nAnderson PHA\nerinh@andersonpha.com'}< /resp>< GmapID>

Very happy with my furnace and AC system including a new state of the art thermostat!  John Baer did a 5 star job listening to my concerns and was patient with my tenacity to ensure certain issues were resolved.
Areas that could be improved:

1.  Electronic contract administration.  i.e. could not open email to print/save contract which we changed a few times and called twice for a final copy which I still haven't received.

2.  Training on new products.  i.e. a snag installing the new thermostat which didn't get resolved until the next day, but they did resolve the issue professionally and was diligent in training the customer and ensuring the software was functioning on my cell phone.

3.  Patchwork to drywall.  i.e. we relocated the thermostat and the hole from existing location was poorly done.

These are easy things for the company to fine tune in their administration/installation process.<//Text>

Reggie needed to visit 5 different plumbing supply outlets to find the spud and washers needed and, in the end, worked hard to successfully repair the leaks. The only problem was an unexpected flood of tank water after he had picked up the old towels we laid down so that I had to rush to use my good towels to mop up the flood onto the hardwood floors just outside the bathroom. No permanent harm done. He did a nice job and cleaned up afterward. HIGH recommendations to Reggie and to Anderson PHA.

The purpose of this letter is to commend the Anderson Plumbing and Support Team for the Team’s superb performance and assistance.

On “day one”, I submitted an email request to the Anderson website for a replacement of toilets in two bathrooms and a repair to an additional bathroom toilet. I received a courteous call from the Anderson Team and arranged an Anderson “on site” visit on “day two” at 8AM.

On “day two”, a few minutes before 8AM, I looked out and saw an Anderson Truck parked at the curb. Anderson’s Plumbing Service Technician, Jesse Salcido, arrived at the door exactly at 8AM. He was ready in every respect to discuss our needs and his recommendations for the replacement of the two toilets as well as the repair of a third toilet. My wife and I agreed with Jesse’s proposals. Jesse was prepared to head out and pick up the new toilets and materials and return the same day to install the toilets or to return the next day after picking up replacement toilets to do the installation work. My wife and I decided it would work best for our schedule to have the work done the next day on “day three” beginning at 9AM.

On “day three” Jesse arrived on time and completed the following efforts:
a)	Replaced both angle stops for hallway bath toilet and master bathroom toilet.
b)	Removed old toilets in both bathrooms, installed new wax ring and bolts and replaced both toilets with new Toto Drake 2 ADA
c)	Rebuilt guest bathroom toilet with new flapper and replaced toilet seat
d)	Also installed a 4” clean out cap in front yard.
Jesse worked “non-stop” and completed all the jobs listed above in less three hours. (Thinking back, I believe it was closer to two and one-half hours.)
Jesse is a professional in the finest sense of the word. He represents the “best of the best”. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and an outstanding representative of the Anderson Plumbing teams that serve all over the San Diego area.
The entire Anderson experience was a very positive experience beginning with the courteous office staff members, Brittany and Kimberly who provided a telephone response my calls confirming work dates. In  addition, I want to commend  Stephanie P  and Devin C. for the way they processed the billing for the work. One word describes Anderson Plumbing –
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Very respectfully,  Dennis< /Text>

< review>
We had a blocked toilet that we couldn't fix with a plunger or a toilet auger from Home Depot.  Turns out that a piece of plastic wrap from some cold medication fell into the toilet, and though liquids could get by, it blocked all the other fun stuff that goes down that way.  Anyway, everything turned out well.  Mitch had to remove the toilet for this, and then put it back with a new wax ring.  Not sure if this is too much information, but Anderson Plumbing wants us to review them, so here's our review.  I called them this morning, and they sent someone out early in the afternoon.  It cost us $454 for this service, including the VIP discount we had paid when they installed a new hot water heater for us.</review>

We set up an appointment for Anderson Heating and Air to come out to fix a leak we had coming from the overflow pvc pipes on our system.  All the service people were extremely courteous and helpful.  When the technician evaluated the issue and removed the pipes to determine the problem he gave us an estimate of $1000 to replace the pvc pipes and install a valve.  We were appalled.  He was able to get us a price of $800 which was still too high.  Since he had already removed the pipe we agreed to pay the lower cost but shared our dissatisfaction and the fact that we will never use their services again.  The cost was outrageous.  This was our first and last experience with them.< /Text>

I want to say that it was great to call and have Kristie tell me that a service tech will be calling me back in the next half hour. She was correct in that Tim contacted me within 15 minutes and arrived at my house in less than an hour.

Tim was great! Not only was he very knowledgeable but he was efficient and very friendly. I love the fact that Time was able to reach past the 100 foot drain problem by putting two snakes together. This was great to see, an thinking man!

You guys have me hooked for my future plumbing needs!

Thanks Tim; see you at the Escondido car show!</review>

Jerrad was very professional and showed up on time every time to continue working on it until it was resolved. He continually checked in to let us know what the status was and what needed to happen next.

Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air is lucky to have him as part of their team as he is a great representation of their company. Kind, helpful and they always follow up on what they say they will.

Called Anderson because one of my neighbors recommended them and couldn’t have been more disappointed. Bernard showed up and was very nice but tried to gauge me on price. I hit my water line in my yard while I was digging and needed a small piece of copper pipe coupled. I already had the pipe dig out so all he needed to do was cut the pipe and install the coupler. He even admitted that the job would take 30-45 minutes but once he input everything into his iPad he wanted to charge me $650!  I know a Saturday call may cost a little more but it was only 3pm and for less than an hour of work and maybe $50 in parts this seems like trying to gauge someone who you know doesn’t have water right now. I told him no and he preceded to charge me $99 just to come to my home.  So if you don’t agree to their way inflated price you still get charged.

I just called a local plumber in the neighborhood and he finished the work in 30 mins and only charged $300. He was gonna charge less but I insisted on giving him that much after my experience with Anderson. Make sure you shop around before using these guys. They try to take advantage of you when you are in a tough spot without water service.</Review>

George, technician just arrived at my home at 5:00 pm in black pants and white shirt and gave me an huge estimate to fix my plumbing.  Since it was such a huge estimate, I immediately dismissed him, and will look for other ways to fix a leak in my system.  Seems to me, I was and am taken advantage us by being a senior widow.</text>

In my 50+ years of owning and maintaining a home, I must say that the service provided by Larry Fawcett of Anderson Plumbing was outstanding.  He patiently explained what caused the huge leak under my sink.  Both the washing machine and the sink are connected to the same cast-iron pipe.  When the pipe becomes narrowed from lint and debris, the water backs up and floods under my sink.  Quickly and efficiently, he reamed out the pipe and meticulously cleaned up after he finished.  He pointed out a potential problem and suggested a solution to avoid another leak.  I am very impressed with the efficiency, patience, and professionalism exhibited by Mr. Fawcett.<//Text>

Mike Gaskill did an outstanding job fixing our air conditioning unit!  The previous technician (from a different company) had not been able to fix the problem.  In addition, Mike brought us with him and explained the diagnostic and repair process step by step.  We learned lots of useful information about air conditioning!  He helped us understand what our future options were and gave us useful facts to consider as we decide whether to continue maintaining our current system or to purchase a new one.  He signed us up for a very valuable maintenance plan and gave us his cell number if we ever have any questions.  I would recommend Mike Gaskill's service to anyone!  Outstanding experience!!</Text>

<review>John Baer walk me through from start to finish with no pressure.  He took his time explaining every facet of the contract very professionally.  I've acquired other quotations for HVAC installation and by far no one did as professional and easy to understood as John.  He does listen to his client's need and make smart project proposal.  Anderson PHA must be so blessed to have you as their Project Manager.  I will highly recommend your company to friends who will experience our new HVAC system.  Thank you very much John for  a job well done!< /review>< Pictures>

Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air we have used on numerous occasions. Dave Grollman arrived (on schedule) and assessed the possible water leak. He was very professional and came to the conclusion that there was no leak, just a bad drywall patch. He could have taken me down a far more expensive road but he investigated all options, suggested the repair and even adjusted the low water temp in one of the baths. Thanks Dave and Anderson PHA. Will be calling you soon for an A/C tune-up.

<Text>I did not have a good experience with this company. I had them out to move a gas line and repair a leak coming from one of the fixtures in the upstairs bathtub. I usually try and stay home when people are working on the house for supervision and to answer questions, but this time I couldn't. Upon arriving home after work I found a 1 ft by 2 ft hole in the bathroom ceiling that was in the room adjacent to where the gas line was being moved and I received a message saying that I could not use my bathroom shower as the pipe below had been cracked. I do realize things happen on a jobsite, but this was a bit ridiculous. And to top it off, when I reached out to the plumber for clarification, he stated it was my fault and that I would have to pay to get everything fixed. He said he would "work with me" on the price but that he is "covered and took pictures." Being in the medical field, I liken this to a surgeon repairing a ACL, but in the meantime cutting the MCL. Apparently the gas line had fallen when he cut it which caused the hole in the spare bathroom ceiling and when he was unscrewing the drain plug, he broke the pipe below. After much argument, the plumber did agree to fix the pipe that was broke but I had to supply all of the parts and the hole in the ceiling I would have to fix. Overall, if you want your house to be in worse shape after you pay $1500, call this company.

After my review for this company I noticed that they had responded with a "we do not have you in our records, please call this number." I proceeded to call this number and express my concerns with their work. After leaving a message and waiting 2 weeks, I have now determined this must be an automated message by the company and this "we do not have your records on file" is a way to make them look like they care. Bad all around!!!</Text><gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</gmap_id><Rating>1<//Rating>< date>

Anderson replaced our water heater and they did an excellent job.  The technician (Ken) was professional and courteous, and he arrived early.  It was a difficult job, because our old water heater was rusted and heavy from years of hard water build-up, but the work was completed in a timely and efficient manner.  I'm not sure how their rates compare to other companies, but the price seemed appropriate for the amount of labor involved.< /text>

<Review>Doing DIYs'  is really satisfying if you   get your home fixes done and actually works, but this time I got frustrated because  even how hard I tried using my rigid motorized drain cleaner I failed this one . I also checked every online recommendations on how to unclogg a bathtub drain. Giving up  is not an option, but that was I just did. Get professional help my wife told me, you can't  fix everything. So we called Anderson plumbing and they sent a young technician by the name of Daylan David, who is professional in every way, he checked  the bathtub , kitchen and bathroom sink to know  what is going on. This time I asked him, if you will do it now how much time are you willing  to spend on this one .........he said an hour, with his pro snake, rags and tools.He  started his snake and in maybe less than fifteen minutes he made the bathtub drain worked again . Thank you LORD for leading us to Anderson PLUMBING and the young technician named DAYLAN DAVID for an outstanding job you guys did for us, we got our shower back.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Many thanks to CJ Barber and Jeff!!!!  These gentlemen were absolutely amazing from the moment they arrived!  They accessed the situation and found the issue right away.  As they worked on the leak, they looked further into the entire scope of things and made the appropriate repairs while having a smile on their faces and explaining in depth the problem and how they will proceed with the repairs. (in the past we had another company come out and they did not do any of this.  Hence, why we found Anderson to come out)  CJ also suggested an Air Scrubber for a cleaner environment in our home, so we purchased one and we are super happy with it!  Our AC is working the best it has ever worked...Thanks again to CJ and Jeff, you guys should be proud of your awesome work!  I will definitely recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air!!!

<Text>This was my second experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  I was having issues with my upstairs bathroom sinks not draining.  I tried to fix it myself, but to no avail.  I decided to call Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air because my previous experience with them was an excellent one.  I called a little later in the evening and was pleasantly surprised  that someone was there to take my call.  I was greeted with a warm, "Thank you for calling Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air, how can I make you smile today?!"  What a nice way to greet your customers!  Right away, you know that you are going to be taken care of.  I was easily able to schedule an appointment.  The first appointment offered was on a Sunday.  That is so great that they could send someone over the weekend.  I knew I wasn't going to be home on Sunday so I made the appointment for the early 8-12pm window on Monday.  Usually when a company gives you a window of time, you can usually count on them coming at the end of the time, if not much later.  This is really inconvenient when you have to take half a day off of work just to wait for a technician.  Not the case with Anderson.  I got a call at 8am saying that the tech would arrive by 9am.  And he arrived by 9am!  Larry introduced himself, shook my hand, and asked for permission to enter my house.  Before he entered, he put on his booties without being asked.  After I explained my plumbing issue to him, he clearly explained what actions he needed to do and explained in detail what the cost was going to be.  I asked Larry if he would mind if I watched so I can learn how to fix a clog in the future.  He said, "Sure" and proceeded to educate me and explain step by step what he was doing and why and how the plumbing worked.  He was happy to do it and appeared genuinely proud of the work he was doing.  Many techs want to be left alone and don't want to be bothered.  Turned out that my drain issue was a bit complex.  Larry used his industrial auger, which put my 20 ft hand auger to shame.  When that did not work, be broke out the beast auger and that fixed the issue.  Despite having to go back and forth to the van to get supplies, despite having to go up and down and stairs, inside and outside the house, Larry stayed calm and collected, didn't mind removing and putting back on his booties.  When he finished his work upstairs, he cleaned up the entirety of his work area and then some.  He sprayed down the counters and glass with cleaner and he made sure he left the bathroom area nicer than when he arrived.  He even thanked me for my help, even though I was there observing to learn from him.  Larry recapped everything that he did, explained the warranty of his work, and made some recommendations without being one bit pushy or salesy.  I was so impressed by Larry's work ethic, professionalism, integrity, and passion for his craft.  Coincidentally, that day was "National Hug a Plumber Day".  To show my appreciation, I offered Larry a tip so that he can buy lunch or whatever.  He graciously said, "No thank you, it was my pleasure to serve you, use that to take your kids out to lunch."  What a great guy!

The next day, based on Larry's recommendation, William came over with his nifty video device.  In order to make sure that there were no other issues with my pipes, William fished his video camera down into my pipes.  We were able to clearly see inside the pipes, maybe 20 feet or so.  This was displayed on the video monitor.  When he was done, William said everything looked good, there was no additional blockage.  He recommended hydrojetting (washing) of the pipes, but at this point it was not an emergency, but should be done at some point in order to avoid future clogs.  I appreciated his honesty when he could have easily tried to upsell me.

This is a testament to what a great company Anderson is.  Built upon family values, they really take the time and effort to show that they care and appreciate their customers.  If you have any plumbing, heating or air issues, I recommend Anderson without reservation!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>michael and matthew were excellent and represented your company with the highest level of service.  they were on time, courteous and very informative.  during the home inspection, they addressed every area of plumbing and rated it as good, in need of service, or something to watch.  they even fixed a rattling pipe by simply adjusting a valve that was not completely turned on.

I have signed up for the annual service program in great part to these 2 young men.

< Review>
I had to have a complete repipe of my entire house done. Bernard and Enrique did a fantastic job!  I couldn't be happier. Bernard did the repipe and figured out the least invasive way to reroute everything. I do have to admit I was a little nervous after seeing all the walls and cieling drywall cut out of all the different rooms, but Enrique was an artist with the new drywall and you literally cannot tell anything was done. The drywall, paint and texture match perfectly.I would defintely recommend Anderson Plumbing based on the quality work that Bernard and Enrique performed. They were on time, no surprises, very professional. Anderson also provided a 20 year warranty. They really did WOW me !< /Review>

<review>This is my 5th or 6th review.  I've been with Anderson's for more than a decade now.  Love those folks!  They're friendly and professional.  They contact me proactively for various service and maintenance on my systems.  They NEVER try to oversell me!  Their prices are very fair and reasonable for high quality items and even higher quality service. I get a follow up phone call after every visit.  I am a committed customer and will remain so.  If you want the best HVAC/Plumbing vendor, contact Anderson's!

6.1.18. Just wanted to add another comment about the GREAT service yesterday by Kevin and Aries for my annual A/C maintenance checkup.  As always with Anderson associates, these men were a delight to deal with.  Thank you, Gentlemen!

6.17.18.  Justin is another example of Anderson's commitment to customer service.  He came out at 0800 hrs on Father's Day for an water heater that went bad and spent all day, and I mean ALL day, replacing it with a new tankless water heater.  Great sense of humor to boot.  He's the latest in a long line of Anderson professionals who've worked with me and he was SUPERB!  I recommend him to you.  Believe me, you will be doing yourself a HUGE favor!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I needed some minor plumbing/fixture work done on my home to get it ready for a home inspection.  My typical plumber did not have availability within the time frame.  I remembered the AWSOME trucks I had seen around, and being a professional female myself, I thought I'd give them a try. Calling and scheduling the appointment was great--super professional without a long wait for service. The service charge was extremely reasonable as well. The guy arrived on time and was really nice.
Before entering the house, I showed him a water spicket that had a stripped handle on it. He said he would look at it before he left but it would be expensive (odd  I thought). One of the jobs was to have a "sticky" diverter (from bath to shower) loosened because it was gritty and difficult to manipulate.   No parts, not major work.  Problem:  the quote to have that done was $550!  Really.  $550.    I declined and showed him another bath tub  where the water stopper was not attached to the Kohler lever so the water would not drain.  He did not know how to fix the Kohler but suggested a toe tap drain.   This, I had to do because I needed it for an inspection. The charge: $330.  Really.  It took him 5 minutes.
He overheard me on the phone telling my real estate agent that the charge was too expensive and he apologized  stating that he didn't set the prices, he only enforced them.

After he left, I got a squirt bottle with vinegar and soaked and manipulated the gritty diverter.  Works just fine.  Really, Really disappointed.< /Text>< GmapID>

Its only been under an hour since he and Nate left, and I CAN BREATHE!!! I am so glad that CJ took the time to explain how the Air Scrubber works. I am having Respiratory/Allergy issues which my Doctor has been dealing with. I thought I  would have to buy 3 Air Purifiers to be able to deal with breathing. I called Anderson, who I have always relied on to take care of my Plumbing & Air, and out came CJ & Nate to solve my problems. I have had a Contract with Anderson since 2007 and I have never been unsatisfied. All the way from Troung Le who made my appointment & wrote down details of my problems but also called back to tell me that he took care to write down for the technician, CJ, all that he may need to help me. I have had CJ take care of me before so I was so happy to see him pull up to my house... I felt so comfortable. I also must say everyone that has come to my house over all these years has given exceptional service. CJ also has that ability to make a customer feel "taken care of" in a special way. He is also a great mentor to those he is training. Nate is new but I can tell you that he will be yet another great addition to the company. In conclusion, thank you Anderson!!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Date>1457905270398< /Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>Russel and John got tasked to correct a difficult Return Air ducting issue with a new install of a Lennox 4 ton HVAC unit in an older existing structure. The original Return ducting consisted of a single 12" round duct. The unit needed at least 1500 cfm, when it only had 600 cfm. I thought we could get another through the lower story into the mechanical room, but only a 6" was able to be installed due to framing and other mechanical systems interference. The solution,  since I did not want the exterior of the structure opened up, was to have the service tech, Russel, crawl up through a small opening in the ceiling of the outside mechanical room; upwards through a 2 story chase, in order to remove the existing 12" and cut in another 12' round to double that capacity. Both Russel and John never hesitated when evaluating the job. They jumped right in, finished in a remarkably short time, made the connections in extremely tight areas, worked cleanly and neatly. The A/C unit now produces the full 4 ton capacity with no problem. Kudos to these guys for their work and extremely positive attitudes, and know how; to be able to get a difficult remodel situation solved.
Thanks Guys.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I had an entire Lennox XC16 and SL280 2 stage variable HVAC system with duct work registers and a new thermostat installed under the HERO program.  Jacob B and Adrian R were my installers and I couldn't be more satisfied with their work.  The system works great and is so much more efficient than my old Rheem. They were careful with my personal possessions, cleaned up after themselves and explained all their processes as they progressed.  They did everything they could to make the install and inconvenience of a 2 day job acceptable with the least amount of disruption.  The price estimate from Erik was reasonable/competitive and I loved being able to use the HERO program.  I had estimates from other companies and chose Anderson for their exceptional service reps, equipment and installers.<//text></record>

<date>1433820650295<//date><text>I contacted SDG& E about a gas smell in my foyer.  They came out and found no gas readings in the home yet checked out the system and found it was changing pressure enough to warrant a complete gas turnoff and lock.  That was on June 2nd.  That same evening I contacted Anderson Plumbing on the web and was contacted that same evening to schedule a technician to come out.

Chris B was very professional.  He and his associate went through the system thoroughly and methodically assessing the situation.  Unfortunately, with this older structure finding the problem was difficult.  But through a process of elimination, Chris was able to narrow it down to an single location and had a theory on the possible issue.  He then proceeded to let me know of the delay in completion do to the fact that he wanted to be sure and not demo my home any more by using a helium test to pinpoint the problem.

The next day the problem area was found and the repairs were down quickly.  Unable to get the County to move faster they were not able to come out on Friday to sign off on this.  The whole weekend was a "no Hot Water"  weekend.

On Monday we got the County Inspector(if you can call him that.)  He immediately treated you staff as if they we amature Craigslist Handymen.  Telling them they did the repair all wrong and used the wrong hardware and proceeded in accusing Chris of not being "qualified"  to do the work because he didn't have a certification card.  He even said this work wasn't finished,  made them change a flex line in the furnace to a hard line( not why he was here by the way) and walked out as Chris tried to explain to him where was mistaken and that he is a professional at his work.  Chris was then, after at least 15 minutes convinced the inspector that he was right.  The inspector basic conditionally approved the turn-on.  And wanted Chris to return to shut off everything later this week so he can come back out and inspect the fixes himself and the pressure reading as well.  Preposterous Crap!

Well Chris got the job done and he and his associate(sorry I for got his name) was supurb, and after six days my wife can now washer her hair.  That's all that matters.

Thanks Chris
Thanks Anderson.

So my air conditioner stopped putting out cold air, at least so I thought when it wouldn't cool my house in 30 minutes on a hot, hot, humid day. I called Anderson plumbing for no other reason than I like their television commercials (especially Mary Jean), and boy was I pleasantly surprised by the service call I received. The technician, Jerrad Hortum, was extremely polite (yes, he wore shoe covers in my home), knowledgable, articulate, and competent. He diagnosed my AC condenser issues in about 20 minutes and he gave me several repair options to consider. While I know it's one of their sales slogan, Jerrad did NOT pressure me in the slightest to make an immediate decision. For that reason alone, I will absolutely call and use Anderson plumbing for my future plumbing and AC needs. (And I sure hope I get Jerrad again. He really was FANTASTIC!)</review>

<resp>{'time': 1517276612163, 'text': '***RESOLVED*** We were able to reach the clients and send another technician out to the home after hours. The clients water heater is still under warranty and they have requested the parts from the manufacturer. We have suggested that the clients go through the warranty company as this will be the best way to get the water heater up to code and not cost them anything in the long run.\nWe appreciate them giving us another chance to make the situation right, and do wish them all the best. We will continue to be of service as needed.\nSincerely, Anderson PHA\n\nWe thank you Mr. Gitesatani for your review. My name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson PHA. I have left you a voicemail and spoken to Mrs. Gitesatani as well.  We are extremely apologetic for the way the service call was handled and would like to speak to you as soon as it is convenient for you. I have given your wife my cell & desk number in hopes to hear from you this evening and get a supervisor out to get you hot water asap. It is never our intention to leave a home with no hot water, or upset our clients as we have you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you very much, Erin Hanson 619-449-3852'}</resp>< gmapID>
