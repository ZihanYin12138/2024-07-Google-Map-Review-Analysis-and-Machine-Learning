Slow service and dirty restaurant.

Took forever to order. Get drinks. Get food. Pay. Everything. Either they were way under staffed this day or it’s just normal.

The place was also a mess. Clean up after your guests, things were sticky and just not good.

Food was just ok.

Won’t be back.<//Review>

Ordered the spicy tonakatsu ramen, the katsu sando and brussel sprouts. The food was fine but nothing was overwhelmingly tasty. For example the brussel sprouts were tasty with the orange slices and walnuts but the nuts were so small that they didn’t really add to the dish. Also it was doused in a vinaigrette but the bottom brussel sprouts ended up getting soaked from sitting in the liquid making the last few too salty and strong. However, there is a good vibe and fun atmosphere in the places with the music and walk art. Maybe a better happy hour spot than full on dinner??<//text>

<Text>We ended up here when my Mediterranean place was last minute vetoed...

This used to be the old spot of East Borough- a modern Vietnamese place I used to go to when I lived nearby. They had great food and drinks- so when I discovered it was a familiar location I was a bit skeptical...

PEOPLE. The people were friendly, staff and managers rushed around attentively, and for a cozy place like this they had ample staff- no problems waiting around trying to flag down a server there. Only one minor incident when I was almost bashed by the kitchen door coming out of the restroom but otherwise very attentive staff.

FOOD. Menu had a bit of everything, it was like a Japanese diner that focused on sandwich and small bites and some ramen.
- takoyaki was a highlight, surprisingly pretty darn tasty, would definitely be something I’d order again
- salad was huuuuuge we got the full and it came in a salad bowl so if you’re ordering a salad get the half size
- sandwich hmmm the guild was interesting, don’t know if it was the horse radish or wasabi but it brought a little kick to the sandwich. The pork katsu was good too
- ramen: would skip these, unless you had no where else to go. (Sawtelle isn’t too far if you want more authentic ramen)
- dessert: this was interesting, I didn’t  particularly like this but my friends raved about it, they enjoyed the black sesame ice cream<//Text><Date>1564508020206</Date><Name>Babs Sheng<//Name><Rate>4< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

The food wasn’t bad but not particularly special either. The katsu was fine, and the bread was nothing special. The cocktails were the best part. Decent enough, but not a destination! Makes me miss East Borough even more.</review>

The ramen is pretty good. My only complaint is that their spicy isn't really spicy. I loved the beer and sake selection. The only problem is that service is a little slow and chaotic, but they're new so I'm sure they're still working out the kinks.< /Review>

My party of 7 was excited to come here and it was terrible experience. The server never came, no waters for a good 10 minutes and it seemed like they simply didn't want to serve us. The hostess( I guess that is who she was)  was rude, unfriendly and spoke to me like I was a teenager when asking a simple question about the menu . One of us went inside to order drinks since no server was coming and they said they couldn't help us . I was done. Went to the spot next door and had the exact opposite experience.< /Text>

<review>My husband and I came for late night happy hour. Brussel sprouts, katsu sando, and ramen were delicious. Service was great. My half price wine was tasty. Hubby's ODB, which is their version of an old fashioned, was fantastic. Fun music (old school; Beastie Boys, Tribe Called Quest, etc.) and nice vibe. We left very happy.<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>It's official: I love the Kastu sando. This is simple comfort food, my friends--it's good because it's fried meat and a schmear on soft white bread. Nothing terribly complicated, just a well presented sandwich that, paired with a glass of wine feels like a little Monday night indulgence.

Happy hour runs from 3-6 pm daily--get the shishito peppers and a half priced cocktail! Also, be sure to check in on Yelp for a free chicken gyoza. We snuck in jusssssst past happy hour and didn't snag any of the deals, and I can't say this place feels particularly cheap in the food/drink department (about $10 for the sandwich and $13 for a glass of Summer Water rosé, which is about the price of an entire bottle of that stuff). They also add a 15% service charge to your bill so we didn't tip on top of that. Would've appreciated a heads up/quick explanation on what that charge was so we didn't feel in the dark about it, but not a huge deal.

The biggest downside of this experience was the staff--they seemed super bummed out to be there and kind of like we were bothering them. Parking also isn't great in this part of Culver City! I usually park in the lot by Akasha but there is some metered parking out front if you want to take your chances on that. TL;DR? Come for happy hour, get yourself a sando, read your receipt thoroughly!<//Review>< pics>

I'm giving this a 3.5 star.

Had the katsu sando, guild sando, wings, Kirin draft, and fat lip. The guild sando was pretty good.  Great flavor, bread was buttered.   I'd recommend it over the katsu sando.  The katsu sando wasn't bad.  I didn't find that it was dry.  It was made well, but nothing special about it.

Wings were okay.  Nothing to write about.  I wish they have 8 "wings" vs 6 and wish they were actual wings vs mini drumsticks.

Overall it was a good experience, nothing great, but I probably won't be back.  Kirin draft for $6 is great however for downtown Culver.

I wish they had something more substantive on their menu than sandwiches and ramen but being that it's a tavern, I guess I understand.  It's a bit too simple for me.

Nostalgic atmosphere with 90s hip hop music.

I also think the mandatory 15% tip is lame as I always double tax as my tip (19-20%).  But to make it mandatory and then leave another line for "additional tip", to me, is a slap in the face.</Text>

I love this store! Toys from the 70's and 80s and great candy that isn't in every store that sells candy. The things i loved the best was their salt water taffy and jelly candy! Plus great customer service so without a doubt I will definitely go back and I would recommend.</text>

<text>We love T.W. Bonkers Toy & Candy Emporium.  My little boy and I regularly stop in to see what unique toy or game we can purchase this time...  They carry a great selection of toys and games, they even sell yummy hand-made chocolates and have an amazing candy selection, (reminds me of when I was a child).  They recently opened a retro arcade at the rear of the store, Pacman, Donkey Kong, Air Hockey and more…  Tony and all of the employees are friendly and more than happy to assist.  We’ve been regular customers for the past 8 years and are looking forward to many more great years ahead!< /text>< UserId.>

<Review>I brought my 8 year old in to shop for his birthday. We had such a fun time perusing this fun eclectic store! My son had an awesome time picking out treasures for his special day and when he told the cashier it was his birthday, the man informed him that he would be getting a free candy at check out! My son chose a slide whistle lollypop for his free candy, and the man slipped another extra candy in the bag as well! It was a perfect birthday outing for a boy and his Mom.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1560620830455, 'text': 'Amber, it warms my heart to read your words and hear that you and your son had a great time at our shop!

<Text>My son loves this toy and candy store (and his parents love it too).  Great selection of quality toys you're not likely to find at a big box store.  My son loves the Hape train display and I'm enjoying the salt water taffy selection a bit too much.  There are a number of retro elements to the store ranging from it's toy and candy selection to the mini arcade in the back - be sure to come with quarters and enjoy some Spiderman pinball, Street Fighter, Donkey Kong, Ms Pac Man, or Centipede.!<//Text>< date>

Feel free to contact me at tony@bonkerstoystore.com to let me know how we can improve our friendliness, and I’ll make sure my staff is better trained. We haven’t received any direct complaints about our mannerisms, so I have no idea what to improve. Hopefully we can win back those extra two stars ! Thanks !!'}<//Response>< pics>

I dig it! It's a super fun store, and Tony is a great owner. I appreciate that he created a bigger board game section that includes some nifty European games and my own "Hangtown the Board Game". Highly recommended!<//review>

<Text>My first time in the store and it's in the middle of the fidget spinner craze! T.W. was at the counter with a line of people buying them and he was fun and polite to everyone, even the teens. He asked if I was looking for something particular, which I replied "unicorn stuff". He set me with everything Unicorn for my niece! It was awesome!</Text>< Date>

Tony has done so well in creating a fun and exciting toy store with a toy for everyone-and now in the candy store, it's every kid's dream! My kids love it there and my son, Drayke, has found a friend in Tony. I love saying "yes" to my kids when they ask to go there; it's always a wonderful experience.</review>

Such a treasure having a local store! The owner, T.W. obviously has their whole heart & soul into this venture as no wonderful detail has been overlooked. In a tired world of corporate stores pumping out mass produced junk, this is the healing remedy. Not only can young & old alike find something (or many things) to delight them within the magical toy stores walls, they can also take in, and take with them, the true "toy store" experience that is indeed so rare; this place is a GEM!!!</text>

<text>My 4 year old BEGS to go in this store. Such an awesome experience, toys out for all to play with, and they answer all questions and will even sometimes break into a new toy if there isn't one out to check out. There is something for everyone, stocking stuffer type toys, awesome wooden and eco-friendly toys, classic toys that are of good quality, and the best fidget spinner selection around. And putty and slime too! The owner and manager are both AWESOME as well. A classic rad toy store, the kind of place that helps make childhood magical. LOVE THIS GREAT lil' toy store!</text>< date>

< review>
The perfect toy store - unique character, organized, clean, friendly and fun!  I wandered into the store to buy something for my niece and nephew.  Usually I associate toy stores with Toys R' Us which is to say, chaotic, loud and messy.  T.W. Bonkers is quite pleasantly the opposite of that.  The place is very clean and organized and you can tell that the owner (who works there) really cares about creating a fun environment -- stocking the store with popular toys, but also unique gems that you likely haven't seen before.   The owner spent a good 10-15 minutes talking with me about what I was looking for before going on to do the same thing with the next customer.  You can tell when a shopkeeper cares about their store and their customers, and T.W Bonkers is an obvious example of this.<//review>

Best toystore!!!. Personal attention is fabulous. Great selections of new and old skool style toys.  Mr.Bonkers, as my son refers to the owner, is so kind and helpful. We always leave with a smile and something new to entertain us.<//Review>

{'time': 1499122451246, 'text': "I understand your experience at my store was challenging today. Brenda showed me the receipt you signed. My goodness, it must have been pretty bad to take the time to write 'F*ck Off' on the receipt, followed by a one star review on both Yelp and Google. Since this is my business, I want to make sure that my customers have a great time at the toy store. If you care to share the details, I would like very much to learn from this, to make sure that my customers always have a positive experience. Brenda is very popular with the local community - so much that when I bought the store in August, many people asked if I would hire her back, which I did. Sometimes we all have bad days, but it is very rare to elevate a situation to a one star review. Would you mind please helping me? Thank you!\n-Tony (t.w.)"}</Response>

Awesome place for some wings. You really get a bang for your buck! Flavors are unique and tasty and it comes with a side of veggies and fries. Their boneless wings were super meaty and bone in was great too. Ambiance is modern and has a bunch of TVs so you can watch your favorite sports. Good service, good location, and overall a chill, delicious place.</Text>

Really enjoyed this wing place. The environment is cool. It's brand new and has a modern design. The wings are really good. I tried the boneless and bone-in wings. Boneless wings are very unique compared to other chicken places. All of the wings tasted crispy and fresh. They put the perfect amount of sauce for me. It wasnt drenched in it, but it was just enough to get all of the flavor. I tried the California, hot, and lemon pepper wings. None of them we're very spicy. The only bad thing I have to say is that the French fries we're just alright. Tastes very similar to Jack in the box curly fries.

All in all it was one of my favorite wing places.
They have quite a bit of flavors to try so I can't wait to go back and try them out again!

Update: Fries are much better since the first time.</review>

This is my go to spot for a chicken sandwich. This spot is super popular and pre-pandemic was busy every evening. Since the pandemic they have focused on take out and and getting your food is quick and easy. My go to order is the Nashville hot chicken sandwich (super fire), tater tots, and zucchini sticks.</Review>

<Review>I tried the original and Nashville chicken sandwiches here. These are both really big chicken sandwiches that’s delicious and filling. The Nashville sandwich was very flavorful and had a spicy kick.

On Mondays and Tuesdays they have a special on their boneless chicken for .70 cent each. They are like heavily battered chicken nuggets.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_id>

Overall the food is still good but covid protocols haven't been figured out... Yet... I know it's the end of the year, I don't know how they haven't figured this out yet...

There's apparently two lines. A center line to order and the right line for pick up? Either way, the right aisle feels sectioned off so it's kind of confusing as no one was going to the correct line.

Also, their TVs have signs that tell people to go outside and wait. But they have some seating not blocked off so everyone tries to sit in those seats... And no one says anything so there's always a ton of people inside.<//text>

<Review>Get there before the lunch rush which starts at noon and before the dinner crowd which gets there around 7pm and you'll be fine and be able to find a table. Order things outside the box. Try the peanut butter wings and Thai Chili are my favorites. Also the garlic noodles, garlic fries and stuffed jalapenos are the best sides!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBJWzLSAsaEqKx2k7LzeDnWBhK0zwQ2amarFmb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa0viCm5bz9Oo3_1F9Sz1oyqVBGBoxz7ZuPYpf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCAR9-LMwQB99ebf8P1darthyjMUJksdCf9JDx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAaW3BX6EFTEphNhWfQ3UNdspgnlIxyktUshQ_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPgWj1Pl-5rJaO9u3rnYo1KiCBcBE6mQI3vDBt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Came here driven by the Amex Shop Small promotions. Was happy to try something different. Sauces were OK, a little sweet, but half of the wings were still bloody on the bone. Terrible. Really disappointing.<//Text>

<Text>I saw this place a few times in my yelp, but assumed it was going to be expensive. After seeing photos of the menu, it was actually really affordable. The wings looked really good too. They had a wide variety of sauces and sides. It also has a lot more seating than I thought.

We ordered 20 wings for $20, the house salad, and garlic fries. We tried the dragon, salt and pepper, and cali rub. Everything was overall really good! Of the three, I think dragon was my favorite. It's similar to San Tung wings, but San Tung's is def superior. The salt and pepper and cali rub were pretty standard, but still good! The house salad was only $6, but was a good size to share. The garlic fries were good too; they use thicker cut fries so I liked it. The soda machine was also really fancy.

I would definitely come back again. Bonchon used to be our go-to wing place, but it was getting too expensive. So, I'm really glad we found this new place. I definitely want to try some of their other flavors.< /Text>< rate>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I've been to several Fire Wings locations but this one by far is my favorite. The service is EXCELLENT, the location is prime, and the staff are so friendly. Even on a busy Saturday night they still seem to get the food out so quickly and fresh. I also will have to say they keep the restaurant so clean and tidy as well. I would definitely recommend this Fire Wings to everybody!<//review>< Pictures>

Fire Wings is my fave wing place! My fave location is their Howe one in Sacramento, but the taste is still the same here. This location is a lot smaller, and they don't have poke here (poke and wings is one of the greatest combos ever fyi!!) Nonetheless still happy this place exists here in San Mateo! Excited for them to open up a San Jose location!< /Text>

Best wings I've had, so far.  The fusion flavors are the way to go, for sure.  No need to worry about the heat.  The fire ones have a kick, but there not that hot.  Good flavor, but go with the fusion ones.  You won't regret it!< /text>

So so delicious. I had the Dragon boneless wings and loved every bite. Also tried the fire fries, which were good, but a little too spicy for my taste buds. My husband had the Louisiana and Thai Chili wings and liked both, but preferred the Louisiana. The kids shared the chicken tenders and garlic noodles. The noodles were a big hit, the chicken was just okay, but they're 5 and 6, so their opinion doesn't count. Can't wait to come back and try some more flavors!< /Review>

<text>Food is good, just needs faster service.
Twice during visits had to wait 25 min one time and last night had to wait 35 min and both times they ran out of ice!
Otherwise chicken wings are really good, for me better than Wing Stop.</text>< pics>

Wings are always great to have with friends. This place gets packed in the evening, so be prepared for a wait. Either that or just get a take out pack and enjoy at home. The flavors are great, I looked the Saigon street flavor, a balance of sweet and spicy.</Review>

<rate>2</rate><Text>We love wing spots and have been to many all over the US. This place had  alot of flavors  but the ones we got were not tasty at all. The extra spicy wings were not spicy at all and the other flavors were tasteless. The staff was very unprofessional, we sat there watching one of the girl employees throwing food at the cook in the back and we watched him throw the metal mixing bowl towards her. After we saw them playing with food in the kitchen we left. This occurred Tuesday at 3:45 pm 2/25/2020. We suggest management review the footage and take action because after seeing that I will never eat there again because chances are your food is being mixed in the same bowls the throw around that come in contact with the floor.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I was extremely happy to see a new wing place in San Mateo. The food seemed good and I thought I would give it a shot. I called to order for the fight and no one picked up, after calling several times through the hour I decided to go pick up instead because their phones might be down. I get there and I'm told " if we are busy we don't pick up" i thought o that's odd. I decided to just order to go, after waiting for around 45 min I found it odd the food for the people after me was being brought to their tables and I hadn't received mine. I decided to go ask and long and behold my order was sitting there for around 30 min soggy wings. I asked to speak to the manager, he said he was busy and tried to brush me off with a 5 dollar store credit( which I refused). This is the reason business don't make it, understaffed and badly organized. My soda had no taste when I got home and the fries were wet and nasty. I would not recommend this to anyone.</Review>

Good variety of tasty chicken. Fire Wings has a good selection of sauces from sweet to savory to very spicy. I appreciate that their spicest sauce has good flavor, not just extreme heat.< /text>

I always manage to find myself returning to Fire Wings like every other week. However, certain menu items are a hit or miss here. Just last night I tried the boneless wings for the first time, and they were hard, dry, and pretty sad. Yet their bone-in wings rarely disappoint, and the garlic noodles definitely hit the spot. The service is friendly and your food is brought out fairly quick for a wings place. Improve the boneless wings and it might be worth a better review.< /Text>

Tried Malaysia curry, Louisiana rub, and garlic parmesan. All the three were good but my favorite was Malaysia curry. They have an awesome variety of flavors and I'm super happy they have dry rubs</Text>

<text>Waited 20 minutes for a chicken sandwich that was inedible.  I'm pretty sure they dropped the chicken in as soon as I placed it and forgot about it and fried it for 15 or 20 minutes.  Tots were okay. Pricey.  Bummer because I was really looking forward to a fried chicken sandwich!<//text>< Pics>

Waited over half an hour for half-onion coleslaw, al-dente tater tots and chicken strips that somehow tasted like hot dogs. Even if the kitchen were faster, the price point was a notch above the quality. Edible, but entirely disappointing.</Review>

<review>Rude lady at register told us only to go orders at 920 pm after we ordered. Slow service and staff doing cleanup of trashcans blocking access to soda machine and bathroom. This seems like it should be done at closing time. Seemed in a huge rush to get everyone to leave. 930 and they put the chairs up. They close at 10pm. Got gone and realized they forgot to put the sauce on one of the flavors.  Really bad service will not be returning.< /review>< pics>

<username>Vanessa Cheung< /username><Rating>3< /Rating><text>The online order system is convenient if you want to save time and skip lines. I arrived precisely on time and was out the door in seconds. They may have you sign a receipt but mine mysteriously vanished so I was spared.

I was craving asian-style wings so I opted for the Dragon and Saigon Street flavors. Tbh they both tasted the same and wasn't that great. Spiciness level = none.

It also had a weird odor that made my car smell for a whole day.</text>< gmapID>

Came here other day to try out.  I ordered 8 wing combo, the 2 flavors were mango habenero and Dragon wings.  Mango was more sweet than hot and not spicy in my opinion.  Dragon wings were ok, don't let she in the sauce long cause they get soggy.  Friend got the boneless wings cali dry rub and Thai chili.  I preferred both of those over mine.  Good size for boneless.  Not bad portion size overall.  Definitely lot of flavors.< /review>

No indoor dining.  Strictly walk up or drive thru which keeps overhead low so the prices are still fair. As long as you are good with that, this is a great place for fast food eats. Freshly cooked, well seasoned food. Nothing less than excellent. Frosty King is a tiny plain little place until you taste the flavorful burgers, fries & fried fish basket.<//Text>

<Text>The food here is amazing and always so fresh. I can feed my family of 5 here for less than at o
Any other fast food place in town. My kids love the popcorn chicken and corn dogs while I am more a fan of the Ortega burger. The pastrami sandwich is also AMAZING! The only down side to this place is their tiny drive through area which backs up to the street with more than 3 vehicles in it. This however is a small price to pay for their food and never stops my family from eating there.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The hamburgers are very tasty and the crinkle cut fries are great. Also, the burritos are good. The sign outside says 'best burgers in town' and I would say they are pretty close to being correct.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>The food is pretty good. Portions are big. Prices are about average. Got 2 meals and a kids meal for 20 bucks. They have a great variety. The drive thru is a bit small but other than that they're a good place.<//Review>< Rating>

<Text>Cheap, tasty, local.

Don't let the banged up exterior fool you, this burger place is proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover. I'm not a frequent patron, but when I've gone, it's consistently been the best burger joint in town. Menu changes up a bit every once in a while, hearty portions, and best of all, they don't charge an arm and a leg for it. With cheap combos that are competitive with the chains, it's guilt free local food at wallet friendly prices.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Everytime I come back to Hanford from Phoenix my first stop is Frosty King. The burgers and chicken nuggets are the best. The seasoned fries, onion rings and fried mushrooms are also must haves. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great eats.< /Review>< pictures>

I had their Pastrami Hamburger and boy was that thing delicious. It melted in my mouth and the flavors blended just right. The Vanilla Sundae was alright. The food was awesome though.
I will be returning when i'm back in the area.</text>

We luv this place for it's location & good deals on their food plus prefer drive thru as on the go alot. My favorites are the hard shell tacos & the Ortega burger is the Best! I order the Ortega it comes with cheese,Santiago sweet Chile which isn't spicy than they put fresh avacado on it + it's not skimpy On top of it   I ask to add grilled onions and Bacon!! That's kinda mix between a Western Ortega and OMG!! Delicious ! Don't forget your order of fries cooked well so their crispy and a side of must have Ranch dressing which is 1of the best ranchs ive had,they charge extra.25 & extra for bacon;,and to grill onions more too but it's all worth it.The Ortega just the way it comes is good enuff on it's own to qualify in my opinion the best item on the menu.</Review>

If you go here make sure to tip in cash. If you pay by credit card one of the waitresses will add or change her own tip and the owner doesn't care.</text>

After one drink in the w hotel, we tried to visit the frolic room at 10 PM on a Sunday and were asked to leave before we got one drink by some extremely rude bartender!  Apparently this establishment doesnt serve people who have plenty of money and are ready to have a good time. Major bummer on my trip to LA. Back to the W hotel lobby! Dont waste your time!< /review>

<Text>Cool place and although it's at the back of a hard to find parking lot...the view there can be very pleasing (to the male eye) where you can also enjoy a beer or hard alcohol (or a "massage" next door after a few drinks) ;-) and there's a nice smoke shop right there too!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Love this place - guys are really nice and patient even with my 5 and 2 year old boys squirming all over the place. They all handle their customers with patience and ease. I really like my husbands haircuts when he comes home from them too! $16/for a boys haircut but we always tip. Not sure how much for a regular men's.

Even though there's a line, it's worth the short wait. Thankful to find a place like this so close to home!<//Review>

Great atmosphere, price is real good based off barbers in the area. Service is good depending n the barber. Some are talkative and some don’t talk at all. Some enjoy cutting hair and some are just cutting hair. That’s the toughest part choosing who you are going to go to or just go to the first chair that is open. My suggestion is check out the barbers, before just hopping in any chair.</Text>

The haircuts aren't bad, maybe a 4 star haircut. I only gave 2 stars because of the entire experience. If you don't mind waiting an hour for a 20 minute average haircut then this is your place. Or you can find a barber that takes reservations and not waste an hour+ of your life.<//review>

<text>Went to this place 2 times.
Several reasons I won't come back.
1 - you can't book an appointment
2 - every time you will get a random barber unless you wait an extra time untill they are free
3 they turn you away from the mirror so you cant see what they are doing
4 - only managers know how to cut hair's well. Other guys will give you an average haircut. I don't like average

But if you are able to get to the manager and don't mind waiting - pretty fine place for a cut.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Prior posts are spot on.  I have been coming to this barber shop for nearly a year now and have never been disappointed with a cut and I have had nearly all these gentlemen trim my crown and beard.

Unfortunately, prior posts are correct about wait times as well. Expect exceptionally long wait times especially during peak hours.  Some times you may luck out and get a seat right when you walk in, but the vast majority of the time expect a wait.

However there is a good reason why you wait, because you are guaranteed a stellar cut.</review>

I always get a great haircut here. I am not sure I have ever left without giving a gracious tip for the quality of the cut. The only reason I don't give five stars is due to the way the line is set-up. There is no organization and it leads to several awkward interactions where people aren't sure who is next. You also need to be prepared to wait. You WILL get a great haircut, but they take their time. I have waited upwards of an hour at times. Please don't let that dissuade you from going; just plan accordingly.<//review>

We had a really good conversation about random topics without that weird barber and person awkwardness. The haircut turned out to be better than what I had originally had in mind. I wish I had got his name so I could mention him. The shop alone is cool enough to just go to for the vibe. The paintings and signs are awesome to stare at. Honestly this might be my regular place.< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>You need a haircut and perhaps a shave. You walk in. Several gentlemen are seated already and stare at you. Now you’re uncomfortable. You sit. You notice the barbers are all a unique bunch of sirs, but with something in common: they will NOT stop trying to make each other laugh. Soon you’re laughing too, but trying not to seem like it because then you wouldn't be the tough, masculine symbol of rugged manliness you are outside of the Golden Crown. Now you're getting called for your turn to get a haircut. You get a haircut. You're pleased with your haircut. You gladly tip the man who cut your hair in such a way that you are no longer a scraggly mess of hippy-dippy, but a full-fledged gentleman, ready for anything life may throw at you.
This is how it is EVERY TIME at the Golden Crown Barbershops. Go to this place for your haircuts and shaves</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>After being turned down by a barber shop, and having unsatisfactory experiences and other shops, I am so so glad to have found golden crown. Shay (hope I spelled that right, sorry if I didn't!) was my barber and he did a great job, he was friendly, and affordable. I've told everyone I know in the area and highly recommend stopping in. It's a walk in only place so you might have to wait, but I waited maybe a tad over 5 min, so really a non issue there. Thanks for the great service!<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is outrageous - BEWARE!  They change their published rates at will.  We just went in for a haircut and their prices were 50% higher today ($30) because:

1. Only 2 guys were working
2. It was Black Friday

Highway robbery!  Avoid at all costs if price stability and honesty matters to you!</text>

some people have "their barber" which I get, I've been one of those people before. What i love about Golden Crown is that I don't have to be one of those people. The line can get long so its great to know that whenever a chair opens up, the dude standing there with the scissors is competent and won't leave me feeling like a schmuck.  Fair warning, I've waited over an hour on a Friday evening/Saturday morning-afternoon but its worth it.< /Review>

<text>Great group of guys, always very friendly and easy to talk to.  The price is right and includes a neck shave.

Even when the place is busy, the wait isn't too long. I trust all of them to give me a good haircut and have yet to be disappointed.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Worst Barber, wanted a low taper ended up looking like Forrest Gump. A good barber listens to what client wants. When you go to a restaurant and waiter asks you what you want (steak) then comes back and  gives you fish what's wrong with that  picture? Get atta here! Never will I go there. Anyone looking for a good barber shop go to American barbershop in Santa Ana. Worth the drive. They cut it the way you want it.</Review>

Never had a bad cut from any barber here, even when I wasn't sure about the look I was trying to go for.
Shaves, the whole 9 yards.
10/10 will continue to recommend.
Cash only.<//text>

The system for who gets the next available barber was just awkward. Customers were left to figure it out themselves which is fine but it wasn't ideal.</Review>< time>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Only reason it's not 5 stars is because of the wait. If you get there 10 min. before it opens and wait you can usually get right in and out. It is first come first serve, so mornings can be crowded and you might be waiting for a while. They are also cash only.< /text>< response>

<review>Been here several times but I don't go there anymore, if you care about your hair you shouldn't go either, The last time I went there the guy gave me the worst hair cut and he screwed up the line that I asked him to make and it didn't look good at all even some other people noticed it too, after he was done I just gave him the money for the hair cut but i did not tip him so he started yelling at me in front of everyone( I'm only 15 years old) , really disappointed by how they tread their customers.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

You're one stop shop for all your plant and hydroponic needs. We got all our soil for our plants from here. Kings mix is our favorite.</Review>

Easy enough to find what you need but not the experience I’m used to from other growing stores in Northern California. Nobody asks if you need help and they do not carry advanced nutrients? It could be a great place to go with small changes.<//Review>

Awesome store with awesome staff.

Purchased an expired item and went to return without receipt. No problem at all. Ended up getting both compost tea and a dechlorinator. Outstanding dedicated staff with a wide selection of products for soil and hydro<//review>

<review>I went in to grab a 20 count of 3 inch net cups I asked the dude about them and he went into the back and grabbed them. I get home and they are 3.75 inch cups. Either dude is incompetent or a narcissist. This is an isolated incident and the entire business shouldn't be judged by it but ill let yall decide. This event represents one of my experiences with them, other then that they have been good.</review>< Pictures>

Great customer service every time I go there. Plus abundance of knowledge as far as garden stuff applies. Lots of products to browse. Maybe a bit on the pricey side.<//Text>

<Text>I have tried all of the garden/hydro stores in the Yuba-Sutter area and this place is the best.  The prices are fair and the product selection is great.  If they don't have they get it fast (days not weeks).  The owner is very nice and he is extremely knowledgeable.  I learn something new every time I talk with him.  They are always willing to help when you have a problem with your plants.  They are not pushy sales people and don't try to sell you things that you don't need.  I had the best harvest ever thanks to their help!  Whether you are a new grower or an old pro, this is where you should go.<//Text>< gmapID>

The only hydroponic store I use. Most places you go to they sit behind the counter and barely talk to you when you walk in there very helpful and have everything you need.< /text>

<Time>1572745507879< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I had a great experience here.  I found this family run shop to be an honest business.  Just like with the other positive reviews, Arturo assessed my car's brakes and gave me his personal opinion about what honestly needed to get fixed: front/back brake pads and front rotor sanding.  Rather than using cheap parts at typical shops, he was using better parts.  He gave me a reasonable price and I agreed.  While I was waiting, I decided to stop by the authentic food stand run by the Grandmother and staffed with other family members $1.50 tacos and $3 burritos.  It was really good.  What I liked most about this place is that it's built off the hard work of this family and I feel great supporting this business.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzFT4WIFxrSWgeabjD0DVsnCKBOFjQEX8lmFFl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQBS73UmpwonPyas3TDAAukRRnoPwx-6zbVj-W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMizPE0057KlyKigD7iSSSD36sXmzTd6q-Z5JU3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCumfNdhe-36vYiNNromCwAtu1hQ_9G6z6zRtm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDBiCTYCP1bINPGBnU1TUOdBMNNertZaVodk6C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgwJqOXhGuHGfTeGyQqQQKt1PcxySVPcl7x2eO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLQzzFks0-Tn7Hx2-Q70_ppLMYbAxqq-dlvUDS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_Ka8464Lck-xFcsmFcB8eO5ySRtLE226-DZtD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKbE6tlj94ow9tR1p6fFo5FStCIA6tttKciWo0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-7YEA7cJnZFKDx8yjyI0GPsnaAbURiPDG3GbJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4uIKxjITFuQcdOMsQP1iCoL22f6ybfEUs87Bz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

Best Tire Place Ever !!!!!!! Amazing Prices and Fast Service! This will now be my spot to go to when needed ! Went to so many places to get a new tire and had to be on wait list for more than an hour or they wouldn’t do the till the following day. So kept search up on google and found this awesome place !  Got my new tire with in mins and were even able to help me get the studs out right since another tire shop I had gone previously broke most of them.

Great Place and Great Prices ! Highly Recommend !!!!</Review>

<review>Called for some info. Guy answered gave me good price. I show up looks like 2 people in front of me being helped. I wait. Guy leaves so I am guessing its my turn. Drive to where the car that had left was. A lady comes thru the alley. The guy ignores me and helps the lady out. After about 20 mins of waiting after that I just left. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Funny thing is she was going for one tire only. I was going to buy 2. Just food for thought.< /review>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Picked up a nail during a rain storm on the 405, and these fellows had me patched up and running again in about 15 minutes, in the rain, for far less than they could charge, at an hour which everyone else was closed.  I hope you guys aspire to grow and take over the LA tire market.  I’ll be first in line next time I need a fix.
Also, I appreciated the “foreign objects found stuck in flattened tires collection” above the garage door.  It is amazing what litters LA roads.
Thanks!<//text>< Pictures>

<Time>1530901576608< /Time><rating>5<//rating><text>My right rear tire had some nails in it and I had to get it fixed before I started my day because I run a lot of errands for my work. I pulled up at 9:02am and they took me right away cause I was the first one there. The gentleman who helped me recommended that I change the tire with the nails in it instead of patching it and then he also said my second rear tire was almost due to be changed as well. He never pressured me into replacing it right at that moment but I went ahead and asked him to replace both so I could get it over with. I was literally out of there with two replacement tires for an insanely good price within 15 minutes!!! I am so thankful to have found this place and for the men who had my car ready so quickly. They are awesome! Will come back for anything else I need. I really recommend them!< /text>< Pictures>

A man named Art short for Arthur helped me. He was very polite. I didn't know much about tires so he also explained what would be best for my flat tire situation and gave me options. It was already closing time and he went above and beyond  to help. Thank you Art!<//text>

<text>It was close to 8 pm and I had a flat tire nearby. I didn't have a spare so I had the tow truck tow me to David's Tires. I called and Arturo said he would wait for me. We arrived after 8 pm and Arturo was patiently waiting! He took off my flat, sold me a nice Goodyear tire for $42, and put it on. He was friendly, fast and helpful. Thanks Arturo for great service - next time I need tires I will come see you first!<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd33dd70ffcc7f:0xfc02d109b7c78c37<//gmapID></record>

Been here twice now, the first time my rim cracked and they stayed open later to accommodate me. Second time I left my car there at 4am due to a puncture. They fixed it without any issue and got me back on the road ASAP! They are always friendly, welcoming, and do an amazing job repairing what needs to be fixed! 5 our of 5 highly recommended.< /Review>

The service here is awesome. Had s nail in my tire and I thought I needed to get it patched , turns out I didn’t. But I needed two new tires and they hooked it up. It was 20 minutes until they were about to close and they still worked on my car. Dope< /Review>

<Review>These guys are awesome they can get your car fixed really quickly and for a really cheap price. We hit a curb around 10 at night and by 10 in the morning our car was fixed and ready to go. The owner of this shop is really nice he even recommend other shops to go to of there are any other problems with the car.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1492366708269< /Date><review>If you're at a tire shop then you already know how you're probably feeling. Concerned, anxious and possibly a little irritable. It all started while I was driving home late Saturday night when I noticed I had a large screw in my right driver side tire. The screw was protruding to the point where I could feel it while driving and you know deep in your soul, something like that needs to get fixed A.S.A.P. But what tire shop is going to be open on a Sunday? David's Tire Shop & service happens to be open on sundays for a few short hours. Obviously because it's a small business they may close the shop early if nobody drops by. So before heading down there I gave them a call around 10 am to see if anyone was still going to be there today and I spoke with Art. Not only did Art Wait for me to arrive, he didn't charge to remove my screw from my tire, he stated that screw didn't go deep enough (phrasing) and didn't cause any damage, it was pretty much just being a nuisance. He put my Tire back onto my car gave me a fist bump and told me to enjoy my Easter. That's right folks , Art at David's tire shop & service hooked me up with free service with a friendly attitude on a warm Easter Sunday. I will continue to purchase my tires from this local business because it's rare to get service like this anywhere else. Thank you again Art. 👊🏼< /review>< rate>

<review>The owner is a great person and he loves and does his job well. I didn't have all the money that I needed for my repairs due to the fact that my Ram was cracked. He made a phone call and got the rim repair for a lower price and gave me a great deal on a tire. Thanks for helping save some money.

I love this shop! It was open late and I called all around to find a shop open late when I was in need of a tire!! Prices are reasonable and worth it!!</text>

I'm from another state and had to stop for a tire replacement. The prices were good for me being in California. The man who helped me was very nice and funny which made my day better due to me having a flat. I definitely recommend this place to all you Californians.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Unprofessional service. When I was about to pay for my service the man told me his card machine wasn't working that he only accepted cash. His words "Go get the money!", so I called a family member to bring me some cash and went I asked for a receipt he said his register wasn't printing out receipts/it wasn't working. While all of this was going on another employee was laughing at me. I wouldn't recommend this place not just because of this but because when he was checking my tires he said everything was fine but I insisted something was wrong Finally he figured out what the problem was but since he didn't have the rims for my car it seemed to me he didn't want to help. Final Thoughts: find another place with better customer service.< /Review>< pics>

I went for new tires for my car and I really liked how well maintained it is in there and that they actually have the office available for you to wait.  The prices are very reasonable and the guys are fast and friendly.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>(Translated by Google) I called this place almost to give 8 and Oscar told me that they would wait for me to repair my tire. This tire shop is the only one open until late, when I arrived they were ready for my change. They did it quickly and realized that I already needed another front tire in which they gave me a good price. Thanks guys, we'll see you soon.

Llame a este lugar ya casi para dar las 8 y Oscar me dijo que me esperarian para reparar mi llanta. Esta llantera es la única abierta asta tarde, cuando llegue ya estaban listos para mi cambio. Ellos lo hicieron rápido y se dieron cuenta que ya me hacía falta otra llanta delantera en la cual me dieron buen precio.

My car was due for some recall services.  Circle Porsche called me to schedule a visit, they sent me a kind text reminder day before, and when I got there morning of, everything was ready to go including a loaner Porsche.  Not only was the recall fixed but I also got a car wash.  Now, I am not writing because I just got a car wash but because the car has some scratches on it that not even a previous professional detail took out but when I went to pick up my car, the scratches were gone!  Circle Porsche went above and beyond to use appropriate chemicals they have to remove these scratches without even me asking and it was just a pleasant surprise later that day when I got home.  This place is such a family-feel place.  Great job to the owners for making the employees feel at home and therefore they make the customers feel at home.< /text>

My daughter found this dealer. It was one of the few dealers that had the car my daughter wanted. Brett Rajotte was awesome! He was super helpful, patient, and personable. Matt also instrumental. We weren't here as long as we had expected. Both guys assisted us in having a great experience.<//review>

Visited Circle Porsche as tag-along with a family member. Brett Rajotte was there to greet me, showed me around and allowed me to test drive couple vehicles. Wasnt on the market for anything but if you are, allow Brett and Circle Porsche to look after you! Fantastic experience, Thanks again Brett!< /Review>

We've been happy working with you to get an appointment made, but it seems that our schedules have not aligned. We would still love to repair your rear bumper and will provide you with a service loaner. Please contact your salesperson, Shaun Murray or anyone else on our team at 562-494-1911 to schedule a service appointment.\n\nSincerely,\nCircle Porsche Team\ncircleporsche.com"}<//resp>

Edit: based on the response below I called this afternoon. Asked to speak to a manager in the sales department. After holding for 3min the phone was disconnected. It’s been extremely frustrating to continue putting time into getting this resolved. It sounds like you have our contact info, maybe you reach out to schedule something?

We purchased a Cayenne from here about a year ago. They promised to fix a paint spot on the rear bumper after purchase. We contacted our sales person several times and can’t get the services promised. They apologize that it hadn’t happened yet, promise to take action, but still haven’t followed through. After reaching out a handful of times I’ve given up on them honoring this fix.

We love our Porsche but suggest looking for another dealership that prioritizes customer satisfaction.< /Review>

I had a most wonderful experience working with the gentlemen in the parts dept. They were all very helpful. I am in awe of their talent and knowledge.  If you find yourself with a ding in your Porsche, or you just want a new updated gadget, these gentlemen are excellent, and quick at finding just what you need. An "Excellent Award" from me.</text>

I came in the dealership to order a car that I didn't realize was no longer available. I met David Nidess.
He explained to me that the car wasn't in production any more, and had me order the next newest Porsche.</Review>

This is the place to go if you are looking to buy next Porsche. Whether it is your first one, or your fifth one, Circle Porsche have always left me very satisfied with my purchase. When I was looking to buy a Macan S, David Mercado showed me all the features of the car and brought me on a test drive. He is very knowledgeable about the product. Eric, the manager, gave me a good deal and catered to my lease needs. Would definitely come back in the future.< /Review>

I'm very happy with the experience I received from circle Porsche, I worked with David Nidess and he was very professional and very knowledgeable. I was able to test drive the car ask questions and I felt his responses were  accurate with years of experience. Next time I buy a new car I will return and look for Dave, cause he was supportive in all aspects especially in his efficiency to get me in and out with no wasted time.</text>

<text>Jonathan Arena was great to work with, very knowledgeable but not nigh-pressure. We were in Southern California for a visit and thought one of Circle's Boxsters might be for us. Turns out it wasn't but Jonathan helped us configure a special order we thought seriously about pursuing. Had he had a car in stock we would not have hesitated to proceed. We highly recommend Jonathan and  Circle Porsche for their expertise, friendliness and straight-forward approach. We have dealt with several Porsche dealers and sales reps up and down the West Coast in our search, and Jonathan was second to none.</text><user_id>117191124788920214983<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>This review is based on their parts dept.

I sent an email requesting cost for parts and labor for a steering wheel replacement. I gave them 3 different steering wheel options I was interested in.

I received an email from Marlon Vargas, informing me only one option of the three worked. He gave me the parts number. But no cost estimate on parts and labor.

I wrote to him on two different occasions within a two week time frame asking for a quote on parts and labor, but no response.

He finally responds and simply says "I can't give you cost on labor you have to call the service department for installation." Are you kidding me?

Two weeks delay, I reached out politely twice and all I get in return is Marlon telling me to contact another department? He STILL didn't give me a price quote. I've contacted other Porsche dealers in the Southern California area and all of them have provided me the information that Marlon couldn't.

He clearly doesn't care about taking care of customers and his lack of response and lack of effort in reasearching my question shows he's in the wrong business.

Poor communication, poor explanations, and it's so blatant, I will never do business with them and will ensure my friends and family are aware.

I did contact Marlon's manager Steve who responded quicky and his peer, Nate, provided me the information I requested in less than 10 minutes. That is not an exaggeration, 10 minutes. What Nate could do in 10 minutes, Marlon couldn't do in 2 weeks.

Again, this review is strictly on their parts department.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Dealership is currently being remodeled so finding parking is a challenge. Was a bit disappointed to drive all the way the to buy floor mats after using their love text service confirming they had it in stock. Parts guy was very courteous but ultimately left empty handed because he was unable to locate said floor mat. But they did have some cool free swag like grocery bag and desktop calendar.</Review>

<Text>Absolutely AMAZING dealership !!!  Management was extremely helpful and easy to deal with !!! It was not a typical experience at all.  If you are even considering a Porsche, I strongly suggest you give this dealership a visit !!!  The sales manager David is really great to deal with, very helpful, and seems to actually care.<//Text></record>

<Text>I have purchase 3 cars from this auto dealership and have consistently maintained each car with the respective service departments.  In my latest service at Porsche I was upsold yet another item that was questionably necessary. Still, believing the tech, I went ahead and bought the new battery.  Needless to say that after they sold this to me they admitted that I had purchased a battery within the last couple of years.  Upon arriving to pick up my car, which I paid nearly over $900 for a routine oil change and replacement battery, the car was filthy and was trapped behind several other cars in their lot.  I had to wait an extended period of time for the techs to locate keys for the cars on their lot.  Took quite a while.  I recommend that if your porsche is not under warranty, save time and significant amount of money and find another service location.  They over charge for their service and immensely disappoint on trying to make things right.<//Text>< pictures>

I dealt with David Mercado (Sales), and Eric Ernst (General Sales Manager).  They were very upfront and honest about everything and were easy to deal with. During the sales process David Mercado spending hours with me going over every possible detail about the car. David provided the best service anyone could ask for when purchase/leasing a 100k plus car. His attentiveness, attention to detail and follow up was excellent.  Eric Ernst was also very helpful in finding me the best lease deal I could get.  The experience was smooth even thru the financial and record recording end. Everyone did their job well.  I would recommend Circle Porsche to anyone who is looking for an easy professional purchase from start to finish.<//Review>< Name>

My 2014 Cayenne Diesel was picked up by Circle Porsche on 12/12/17 in order to complete the "Emissions Compliant Repair", and perform a requested oil and filter change. I received the vehicle back from the dealer on 12/19, and after driving approximately 10 miles received a notice on the instrument panel stating "Oil level minimum reached". I called Domenic Macchia, Service Advisor, and asked that the vehicle be picked up and serviced properly. Domenic informed me he would see when he had a loan car available, and would call me back within one hour. As of 01/02/18 I still had not heard from Domenic.
On 12/28, 12/30, and 01/02/18 I telephoned the General Manger, Eric Ernst and left a message each time, with the hope of receiving assistance with this matter. Still no return call.
Bottom-line, you probably want to think twice about having your Porsche serviced here.</review>

I've been a car enthusiast since I was three years old.  The sales and service experience at a dealership matters to me, which is why my wife and I have purchased our last three 911s from Circle Porsche including a 2010 Turbo, 2015 Turbo S and 2018 GT3. The dealership is about 25 miles from our home and although there is a nearby Porsche dealer less than three miles away, traveling to Long Beach is a no-brainer for us.
At Circle Porsche, it's not just about selling vehicles.  General Manager, Eric Ernst, has a team of car enthusiasts who have a passion for motorsports.   We have always been treated fairly by a staff that has shared our excitement on each 911 purchase.  Also important is the fact that their deals are highly competitive.

Whether configuring a car for himself or for stock, Eric has ordered some truly exceptional cars and SUVs.  So a visit to the dealership to look at the inventory is always a cool experience.  Currently, there is a 911R on the showroom floor and later this year, Circle Porsche will take delivery of their first 911 GT2 RS.

If you're thinking about buying a new or used Porsche, I highly recommend Circle Porsche.  If you're considering a sports car, definitely drive a Porsche.  There are three "Rs" that really matter to me: Racing pedigree, Reputation, and Reliability.  All of these contribute to vehicles that are a blast to drive under all conditions and that represent Porsche's commitment to engineering and high performance.

Finally, Eric Ernst is part of the family that owns other dealerships in the area.  There aren't many family-owned dealerships anymore and a trip to Circle Porsche will make it apparent why the difference between their dealership and others owned by conglomerates is totally in the customer's best interests.

Happy Shopping and Enjoy Your Next Vehicle!<//Text>

I stopped by Circle Porsche to window shop, as I was looking at this beautiful 911S,  I was shortly approached by a well dressed gentleman, David Nidess. Honestly, I don't like salesmen, but Mr. Nidess made me feel comfortable, relaxed and he is very knowledgeable of all products on the floor.. I recommend Mr Nidess on your next Porsche purchase! @Circle Porsche<//text>

<Review>I was in the market for a Porsche Macan. TrueCar directed me to Circle Porsche Long Beach for my TrueCar offer. Chris Mcgregor helped me out. We test drove a Macan base and looked at several colors and options. They end up trading the color and interior I wanted from another dealer. The general manager Eric helped me getting the car I want from another dealer, he was really nice! I love the experience I had there, Chris was an amazing sales person and went through every detail of the car. Most importantly, my Macan is so amazing, I definitely suggest coming here for your next Porsche.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Flew out from Dallas to LA on a day trip and Bought a $110k car from them, experience below

Cons -
- Rafael, one of their Manager, made me feel like he was doing me a favor by letting me spend $110k
- Asked for 2 things for the car, the missing floor mats and a temp license so i can drive it until i get my official License plate. Didn't get either one on arrival of car to Dallas
- Made us sign some documents on arrival in LA as expected. Next day emailed us that they were done wrong. You need to print, have them notorized and fedex them for next day.

Pros -
- Michael from Finance and David from Sales. Very nice and courteous

Recommend dealing with Eric, the manager. He was nice on the phone and in person. Still waiting on my mats, glad i made them put it in the contract or i would never see them.</text>

<Resp>{'time': 1390846871587, 'text': 'Omar, thank you for taking the time to write your review. I apologize that your experience was not to your satisfaction.  After speaking to our team, I learned that the floor mats were ordered for you at your initial request.  Unfortunately, the mats are backordered at Porsche and could not make it to you right away.  They will be shipped to you as soon as they are back in stock.  I am sure that David had communicated that with you as well.  Also, I am sorry for any confusion in regards to the paperwork.  Michael, our Finance Manager, is new and still in the training process.  In regards to your request for a temporary license, there are no temporary plates or licenses in California.  That’s something that would have to be taken care of at your local DMV since we cannot provide a temporary license for Texas.  Again, I apologize for any inconvenience and hope that you enjoy your Porsche.'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd3191375c64af:0xb9137df83a4ac484<//Gmap_id></record>

Very pleasant visit today I spoke with Dave Nidess he is super knowledgeable. 718 boxster is the model I like. We also spoke about the experience center in Carson I'll probably go check it out. If your coming to circle Porsche ask for Dave Nidess</Text>

I came here looking to buy my first porsche, I was on a budget and was looking at the less expensive boxster or a used Porsche. The sales guy I talked to looked down his nose at me like I wasn't rich enough to buy his cars. Worst car buying experience I ever had, its attitudes like that that give other Porsche owners a snooty stereotype.</review>

I asked for a wholesale taxable because I didn't have my resale number on hand & it was already my second round trip out from Costa Mesa  employees were worthless female sat playing on her phone the male took close to 20 min just to find my special order. Then they wouldn't do the sale as a courtesy wanted me to make another round trip to get my resale even after I said just charge me the tax??? Lost any business from me ever as I  drove back to Costa Mesa called SSF bought the exact same Porsche factory parts for $107.36 less. Really ridiculous on thier part time not do a courtesy sale the still would've made a very good profit off me but their greed & horrible customer service has caused me to never do business with them again. Business 101 keep customers happy!!! They failed!!!!</text>< username>

<text>Came in for 20 minutes and no one ecknowleged us it was like we were invisable. There was about five people there who all looked like they could help but instead were just on computers while we were just walking around looking at the cars right In front of them and they knew we were there however they did not care. We told the worker (don't know any names) and argued with us saying he said "how are you doing" (which he did) however right after that he went back to talking to another worker about someone complaining saying they were mislead while buying a Porsche (I don't know if that would make me want to buy one and he was just yelling and I had to drive 20 minutes to the other one. Worst experience ever.!!!!👎👎👎<//text></record>

< Review>
So stoked! I have been here three times. The first time I was there to see a pre owned 911, but the car sold before I got there. I went back a few weeks later because I saw a very nice low mileage 2012 MBZ E63 Wagon. I was hesitant, because I didn't want to get beat up on my trade ('07 Z06 Corvette). I met with Joe Grimaldi who very graciously let me look the car over (he moved it into the shade and left me and my wife alone) at my leisure.
Joe followed up with me a few days later. He said that the car was still available, and that they hosting a special event on Saturday. I returned, with my trade to drive the E63. after a test drive and some simple and painless negotiation, I was the proud new owner of the E63.
Thanks to Joe and Rafael Borenstein for taking good care of us and being respectful of our time. Can't recommend them enough! There are other dealerships in the greater LA area, but this is the store that works hard to meet your needs.< /Review>

<Text>I’ve been wild about cars since I was three with a passion fueled in my college years as an SCCA volunteer at Watkins Glen where I watched Mark Donahue and George Follmer wrestle Porsche 917s around the track in the Can Am series and club racers in their 911s in SCCA class races.  It matters where I buy my cars and I’m writing this review as an enthusiast and a very satisfied customer of Circle Porsche in Long Beach.

My wife and I recently ordered a new 911 and as with our previous purchase from Eric Ernst at the dealership, it was a terrific experience.  Even though I consider myself knowledgeable about 911 options, Eric advised us on some take-aways and some add-ons that resulted in a much better car - and the MSRP was lower!

That’s what’s unique about Circle Porsche – it’s all about enthusiasts not just profit.  A visit to the showroom is a cool experience just to see their sports cars, sedans and SUVs.  GTS and Turbo nameplates abound and Circle Porsche has received its third 918 one of which will be in the showroom for a few months prior to sale.  (Check out YouTube for the Porsche video on the record breaking lap at Nürburgring.)  Virtually every premium automobile dealership is within two to five miles of my home, but the 25-mile ride to Circle Porsche is worth it.  As a fellow car enthusiast pointed out, the Ernst family dealerships in Long Beach are among the few remaining family-owned automobile businesses in the U.S. that have remained independent of a corporate buy-out.  That will be obvious if you visit Circle Porsche.  Great Cars, Great People.  Have Fun!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Super tasty food!

The beet poke is the real deal!! I'll order that every time I go there.
Neat ball Masala was very tasty. Meatballs were juicy. And the plate itself was really filling.
Green Forest pizza was dank. The mozzarella was rich and creamy.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I find some comments true some and some not. Nice girls are available depends on the day and time you go in. They dont have drinks inside but that doesnt mean i couldnt drink mine before going in. Anyway not a bad club around here. Will go there again and again.< /review>

Patricia is amazing. Very kind, personable, knowledgeable and professional. I am sad to go because I really had a great experience with her. I simply do not need the unit anymore. The location seemed very secure and it appears to be really clean as well. I would highly recommend this location. Patricia makes the experience excellent.< /text>

Patricia was super sweet. Once we arrived she had great energy and was very polite  She showed us the storage unit which was a 10x15, clean and have a light inside in case we ever need to come at night. She also explained exta storage terms and aggreement clear and brief.  Overall, it was a great experience and I'm glad we stored our items there.<//Text>

<text>Patricia was very easy to work with and she was transparent with overall costs. I made sure to shop around before making a decision to rent here, and I'm glad I rented with her. The office is small but very clean and the grounds are well kept. Availed of the promotion they had and this fit my needs perfectly.

They offer locks and boxes and although it seems like on the pricier side, it is quality product.</text>< user_name>

Renting space at Extra Space Storage was a wonderfully positive experience. I felt safe whenever I was at the facility. In addition, the units are very accessible. Never a delay getting in and out. I could drive right up to my unit, accomplish what I needed to do, and be gone in a very short time. The grounds are clean, well maintained. Staff is professional and very helpful.< /review>

We got the space over the phone and Patricia gladly showed us our parking space for our travel trailer. I'm a traveling nurse so this deal works out great. Sorry it took so long for me to write a review. The service we received was beyond what I would expect to get at a storage facility. Patricia was sincere and made sure to make me feel safe to leave our trailer at her facility.

Besides that, I like how easy it is to get to 101 from here.< /review>< Pics>

<text>All the Extra Space Storage’s I’ve rented at have been terrific, this one in particular was great because the units are all drive up and very well lit in the evenings. I have to say, for the value and overall service, no other storage facilities are up to par. Patricia has excellent customer service skills and really cares for her customers 🙂<//text>< Pics>

My experience started off questionable due to a system issue with my rental.  However Patricia was VERY helpful and polite about the situation.  I determined that any issues I had were only that of a system issue with the new Rapid Rental online feature.  So I give 5 stars for service, 3 stars for the system issue.  Overall 3 stars.  I can safely say that if Patricia is the one helping, you will be taken care of.<//Text>

This place is tucked in the middle of Forest St and it has two gates to enter. Very secure facility and they offer the best locks and security! Couldn’t beat the price I got first month rent free I only need the space for few weeks so this was awesome!! 😎</review>

Simply ask for Patricia for your storage needs. She called my mom when she accidentally left her keys in storage. Patricia called immediately to let my mom know that she found the keys during her lock check. We literally just left 10 min ago. Thank you 😘😘😘<//review>

<review>Drove my RV to my locker to load up for an upcoming trip. Forgot my lights on and drained the battery. I had to leave the RV there overnight before I could get service. Primo was fabulous. We had left a note on the door explaining what happened and my name and phone number on it. Primo gave us kudos and asked if we needed help. He was very gracious about a 37-foot RV left in the row!

Overall quality storage experience.

I was desperately in need of a space when I came across this site online. I’m glad I chose this place. It’s tucked in on Forest St and the place is very clean and peaceful.

Patricia was the facility manager in charge that assisted me with renting a storage with my husband. Thank you. God bless.< /text>

Patricia was immediately attentive and made sure to introduce herself, more smile and super time efficient and friendly right at the start. Considering I came in near closing time, she still took her time to show me a unit and even a better options and costs etc to allow me which would be better. She was very much someone who showed me how tedious and stressful moving is that even getting a storage unit can have a friendly experience.

Thanks again Patricia :)</text>

Patricia was so awesome. Once she found out that I was on my lunch break, she immediately put a rush on it while explaining everything thoroughly. She was kind quick thorough and very professional and had us in and out in no time. I will definitely recommend your site to others that are looking for a storage facility. Great job on finding the right person to run your facility, I feel at ease and safe knowing she treats the facility as if it were here own items being stored. GOOD JOB PATRICIA.

I went to Extra storage today to check out the 10 x 10 storage unit. It was clean and secure. Patricia was so helpful and  answered all my questions with a smile. Got set up and am excited to start storing my things for a cleaner more spacious home. Thank you Patricia! Much appreciated!< /Text>

<review>The people at the location I used were friendly and nice. However, be sure to give your move out notice at the time or right before your monthly payment is due so they adjust your payment to your move out date because they do not reimburse you for days not used if you move out after the monthly payment has gone through.</review>< Pics>

The space is secure and the facilities are very clean. I found that the rates are the most competitive in the area and blow the prices on the coast out of the water.

While moving in, the amount of space I needed wasn’t going to be enough and they were very accommodating getting me a larger setup without any additional fees (minus the cost of a bigger unit, of course).

Would definitely recommend to anyone with drive up storage needs!</review>< pics>

Five star service from manager Ms. Patricia. I can’t say I’ve ran into someone so cheerful on a Monday morning so eager to take me around on her golf cart to show storage units. Overall great service and great promotions!<//Review>

<review>I was pleasantly surprised with this site, reading some bad reviews on yelp I figured I’d still give extra space a chance.
Gino helped me get setup with my storage unit. The process was fast and he explained and answered all of my questions. He is we very professional!
The facility was very well maintained and i felt very secure leaving my belongings in this site.
I highly recommend this site for all your storage needs thanks again for all your help Gino!< /review>< name>

<Text>I recently stopped by the Gilroy location to inquire about units and pricing. Patricia was the agent on duty that day, and she was very friendly and helpful with the information she shared, and she showed me the different available units. Most places would have taken my basic inquiry as a sign of me just window shopping and not have taken me seriously, so I really appreciate the amount of time Patricia spent with me.<//Text><user_name>Joseph Mundy</user_name>< UserId.>

Hot day in Gilroy but received great customer service nonetheless. Needed to make a payment while Patricia was cleaning units in the heat if that’s not dedication to her work I don’t know what is. Give the manager a raise! I see this woman keeping her facility guarded and clean< /Review>

Wonderful customer service by the manager Patricia! Overall great experience getting a storage unit with my mom. Most of these 1 star reviews are absurd they don’t even detail why, they must have mistaken it for 5 star haha I don’t see why anyone wouldn’t store here.

I was looking for Rosso’s warehouse and stopped by this office. The facility manager Patricia directed me where to go and in the same breath I inquired about storage units.

By far the best Storage experience. I’ve looked everywhere for a clean and safe facility and this one is it. Patricia went above and beyond to help me with my storage needs. From her phone call to showing me the unit and the lease. Thank you Patricia!!</Text>

I never really had the need for Storage until my landlord gave me such short notice that he will be selling the house. I reserved a unit online and in seconds Patricia called me to let me know that they have received my reservation. Talking to her immediately put my mind at ease and she helped me throughout the entire process. People might not think much of it but customer service is key to running a business and she is just wonderful. Thank you for making a stressful time into an easy experience< /review>

< Review>
My wife and I rented a 10 by 15 storage unit with Patricia and was very happy with renting with her. Very spacious space that fit all of our belongings. The units are easily accessible as well they are drive up and they have a light in the unit in case you need access in the evening and sort through your items.

Overall I have to give this place 5/5 not only because of their great rates (first month free was a plus) moving is already stressful enough.
We gave it 5 stars because of the impeccable customer service we received. We will definitely store here again and tell our friends and family about this location.

Regards
Renato and Miriam</Review>

<Text>I showed up to Extra Space Storage after considering another location to store my belongings, and I'm super happy I did because it is an awesome facility with an even more awesome manager.  Patricia has great costumer service skills and really made me happy about going there.  All paper works were done in a matter of minutes and she was clear about all options and costs. Also, it was a extremely hot day and I worried about walking to check out the storage,  but that was not a problem because Patricia has a golf cart and it was ready to go.  Thanks Patricia</Text>< response>

Patricia was amazing. Very warm and understanding. I had just come from another storage facility where my unit had been broken into and trashed. She listened, calmed me down and got me squared away with my unit at extra space in a very timely manner. She was very clear and thorough. Exactly what I needed right then. I can't thank her enough ~ truly. 👍<//text>

Outstanding service from the manager Patricia. She helped me out with all of my storage needs and I only have great things to say about her and her property. I had called the number listed by the door and Patricia came running back to the office with the most welcoming greet & smile. That in itself sold the deal. I will continue my business with Extra Space considering they have such a great employee working here.< /Review>

I just want to say that Patricia is amazing!!! She made our move so much easier. She's very helpful, kind, and very knowledgeable. This is our first time using a storage company and I had some issues and worries about storing our belongings. She made us feel comfortable and assured us that the property it's secured, monitored 24hrs and does daily lock checks. I'm happy we went with Extra Space Storage in Gilroy! Thanks for everything Patricia!!< /Review>

Prices at this facility are reasonable and the place is well kept 👍🏼. Access hours are from six in the morning to ten at night which is nice 👍🏼 The store manager Patricia helped us with signing up and showed us how to use the keypad. Unit was clean 🧼 and available<//review>

I talked with Jensine today and she was excellent!

I made a reservation to come in today and Jensine was very friendly as she greeted me as I walked inside the office.  She answered all of my questions, showed me the space to rent and asked me plenty of her own questions and was great to chat with.

In the end, the 10X10 space was a good size and even though they require either your own homeowners insurance or get insurance from them,  we decided to rent the unit.

The units are clean and feel fairly new.  I don't have any issues with storing our stuff here.

Thank you Jensine!</Text>

<review>Jacked up rate a few months after moving my stuff in.  I guess they figure you don't want to go through the hassle after just moving all your stuff.  Bad enough that they jack the rate up so soon, but no notice,  no email,  just pulled more money from my credit card.  Oh, and that "first month free" sign is just to lure you in,  only applies to a specific unit.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Gino was very friendly and efficient in explaining all the details, and with helping set up my account. The facility was clean and easy to access. E.S.S. is thorough with their services. Worth the only slightly higher price (compared to Leavesley Mini Storage) for great accessibility, security, and availability.</text></record>

<Text>Patricia and Benny were just fabulous the units were clean, well lit and very secure.  I moved from a large unit to a smaller unit and the move went wonderfully.  Every time I come by the office I have been met with a smile and they even remember my name.  If you are looking for storage this is the best place in the gilroy, morgan hill area.< /Text><user_name>dallas holt</user_name><Time>1520398299418< /Time><GmapID>0x8091e3d1286fa17b:0xdb09c9a3ab5edff7<//GmapID><Resp>None<//Resp>< userid>

< review>
Elenor was very helpful! Yes they talked me into renting here, I found this place by googling 24 access storage units. However it's aperently not that way. I don't recommend renting here If you need after hours access. I'm literally sitting in my truck for 8 hours waiting for them to open. ..looks like I won't be renting here for more than a month. At least they could do is allow 24 hour access for moving In and moving out. Most places I've rented will make exceptions. This was a major inconvenience.< /review>
