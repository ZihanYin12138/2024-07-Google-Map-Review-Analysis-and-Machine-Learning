Currently relaxing in their ‘living room.’ I’ve been here once before. Both times I was well fed. The no-pressure environment gives me the space and comfort I prefer. When I can’t see my primary Doc between appts, RI helps me with everything.< /Review>

<Text>If you’re looking for treatment for anxiety/panic disorder or depression, do not come here. It’s the COVID era and they had many of us corralled in a small room, sleeping on Lay Z boys and floor mats, many patients not wearing masks. This was apparently because no beds were available, but I had talked to people who said they’d been there in this small room for three days. I got discharged hours after entering even though I would’ve liked inpatient help with management of my very severe anxiety. The nurses were unkind and treat you like you aren’t human. I’m perfectly human and capable, I am just struggling at the moment with some debilitating anxiety. These are hard time. This was a nightmare.<//Text><rating>1<//rating>< GmapID>

<Text>THEY WERE HELPFUL, PROFESSIONAL AND POLITE.  My son was placed in the juvenile section on a 5150 for 72 hours.  They were supportive and attentive.  He didn't have a problem with the food.  Bedding was clean and adequate.  Food was fine and served on time.  Staff was polite and responsive.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>To whom it may concern....
what the f***!? , I call the hospital number listed on the google app and the recording repeats itself after I press the  number it tells you to press for assistance. I get to the mental health hospital and the people that work in the front are rude and very disrespectful. You obviously can tell who is there to help and who just wants a damn paycheck, I mean come on if you dont want to help people that need help then why work there. You guys dont make the situation any better. Help us by getting a different job and stop laughing at  those who are sick , yes they were laughing at both me and my sister when we brought her in. I'm still very upset when I think about it ,but not as much as disappointed.  I pray that they find it in their heart to change their ways< /Text><UserId.>113471193042220069408< /UserId.>< Date>

< Review>
I was in the adolescent unit here and it was okay except in the waiting room, you wait in this room and sleep in weird chairs and the lights are kept on all night, luckily the day I got there I got put in the inpatient program so i got to sleep in a bed that night. but the food is really bad and the doctors don't care. i went for a suicide attempt and i was severely depressed and the doctors kept saying "what do you want us to do about it?" when I told them I wasn't feeling any better. I had to lie after 2 weeks of being there that I was getting better because they weren't doing anything for me. I got sent back to another hospital the day after I was discharged because I was   still having suicidal thoughts. point is!!! I don't recommend coming here if you have a choice. I recommend loma Linda or Aurora charter oaks. the only good staff here that I can remember was amber. she was very nice and played uno with me and the other patients. besides her and like 2 other nurses. all the other nurses SUCK you cant understand half of them because of their accent which isn't their fault but it's very confusing especially to a minor. and kids are treated pretty badly tbh< /Review>

Have y’all watched American Horror Story: Asylum? Because this place is exactly like it. I wa starved and only given an apple the first day. The staff here treat the patients like dirt. They make fun of their mental disorders and constantly mock them. The nurses even told me to lie about my mental state in order to get out of there. There are people who’ve been there for 10 years and the staff doesn’t do anything for them. The place is cold and they only provide you a towel to sleep with. The food is horrible too.< /Review>

This is my first time posting a review.  Ive been to riverside ets two times for 51/50 suicidal. Once in 2016 and once in 2018. And let me tell you  they treat you any less than human. They treat you with disrespect, with disgust. This is a place where you should feel comfort from the distrested way you feel. Not like an outcast not like a piece of garbage. They dont have beds. Just uncomfterable couches. And if those are full you sleep on the floor. With a thin blanket. You cant pass the line from where the nurses are watching you because they threaten to put you down any step closer you take to them. The bathroom is dirty. The room where you are in has dim lights theirs nothing for us to do their. They treat you as if you are stupid. Food is awful, just plain sandwichs and no water to drink. Theirs nothing to do but loose your own mind more and more as you sit their. The workers are awful too. If you do not enjoy your job this much dont work a job like this. Dont take out your frustration on people. Im pretty sure if you were to feel suicidal you wouldnt want to be treated like trap would you? TREAT PEOPLE HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED. This place should get a new owner someone who actually cares and wants to help them make a difference. Im speaking for the people who have been here and didnt get the help they need. And for myself. WE NEED TO SPEAK UP AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE.< /Text>

<Review>Horrible Staff! Why do we allow these rude human beings to care for our loved ones? Many of them have NO BUSINESS TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE IN NEED They really need to find other employment because evidently they don't enjoy what their doing for a career. I've seen animals treated better. GOD has a very special place for human beings treating other human beings in this manner. The majority of the staff come from a country where there is much war and poverty, that may explain their behavior. They are not nice to each other either, it's learned behavior and probably their culture. Their English is very, very poor, and rude is an understatement! It's pretty ironic that they have come to The United States Of America and take advantage of our education system and choose a field of taking care of OUR Mentality ILL U.S Citizens. This entire mental facility needs to be investigated.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Do not come here. This place is not safe. It does not help patients. It's student doctors and a learning hospital. Let me tell you specifically what the staff does. Social worker Albert doesn't provide assistance to the family nor patient. He says one thing and then nothing is done. Patient HIPAA rights violated which is a federal crime. I was provided several different patients name instead of my child by charge nurses. They also told me my child wasn't there when I knew he was. I was providing an illegal prescription for a code 2 controlled substance prescription. They falsified my child's after care documents. I was also told by Bonnie that she refused to help me with my illegal prescription. I have this recorded. I am completely dumbfounded that with all this negligence that this facility is open to the public. RN Valerie on the adolescence ward wasn't even able to repeat my complaint back to me. Bonnie also stated who is not a doctor what meds to take for my child. This place need a full investigation of all the violations.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dcb732447abf65:0xb1671eda24442cc2< /gmap_id>< date>

<Review>This is the WORST place ever!!!  Do NOT take your loved ones to this facility.   My brother was here and for TWO nights he had to sleep on a CHAIR ... how awful!!  Then when we called to get information on him all we got was the runaround!!!  They didn't even know which unit he was in, first they told us he was unit C, then they said he's not here, he is in unit B, they said he is not here, he is in unit C ... They are all F%*ked up at this facility.  Then they say they will call you back and NO ONE calls you back to let you know what is going on.  This morning I called back and Rose put me on hold for 24 minutes and never came back to me!!  I called in on another phone and she answered, then argued with me that she didn't keep me on hold that long and put me on hold again.

If you love someone DO NOT bring them to this facility!!!  Their stress level will only escalate and you will NOT be helping your loved one.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I found out later through a friend of mine that my nurse never even went to nursing school how was she able to get access??? I can't believe what I experience there... I ask to make a phone call. None of the staff answered me and just ignored my presence altogether. So I just leaned up against the counter and waited for them to notice me. As I’m waiting for their assistance, I couldn’t help but notice, the commotion going on in the office that was located inside a room behind the counter.

There was a woman in there who was clearly crying in pain along with a female voice who was speaking to her harshly as I could hear hard thumping on some sort of surface. “Keep your hand right there! Why would you think something like that about someone!?". There was a short pause as I could hear the victim blubbering. "Are you going to tell me?... ANGELA! AM I GOING TO HAVE TO PULL ANOTHER NAIL?! THERE ARE ONLY 4 LEFT!” The voice shouted sternly. “No! Just let me go!” the woman cried. “Your not going anywhere! Now why would you think that about her? This country already has enough crazy people running around, and your only making it worse.” I then heard this small metallic “click”. The woman screamed as I could hear the clanking of her nail being dropped into a tin tray. This particular scream was loud enough to arouse a staffs attention who was sitting there going through what appeared to be some kind of log. I'm standing there staring into the doorway of the room as she gives a quick glance over her shoulder and quickly slams the door to it. She then glances up at me with this scolding and menacing look, "Go sit down or you're going to be next!!!".

I didn't know what to think or even know how to process what it was that I had just witnessed so without saying a word, I quickly scurried back to my room, sat on the edge of my bed... thought for a moment and began weeping. I really really hope that whoever that woman was who committing that abuse is spending the rest of her life in a cold prison cell.</review><resp>None</resp>< user>

Nasty place to wind up. When I got released they gave me my purse and the entire contents of my wallet were all over the inside! THEN...The next day I go to the grocery store and discovered that my debit card and other cards were missing! I went home and called the creeps, got the run around and around all to be told my items are locked in a safe, they refuse to mail them to me and the only way to get them is to come and pick it up. I live a fricken' hour away and have no vehicle!!! What a bunch of a-holes!< /review>

The nurses here really liked giving injections to patients and locking them in an isolated room and would find the tiniest reason to do so. Other than that the nurses don't pay attention to you and treat everyone there like you're a crazy delusional child that doesn't know what they're talking about< /Review>

One star is too generous for this "facility."  I recently needed to utilize local agencies to ensure the safety of a loved one and based on the persistent suicidal ideation that was being expressed, the decision was made to send them to ETS for psychiatric "care."  Care is the absolute last thing on their mind.   Before my relative was admitted I inquired about the necessity of a consent form being signed and I was told twice that it wasn't necessary.  However, once I attempted to get in touch with my relative, I was told that I couldn't get any information at all because a consent form wasn't signed.  Despite that, when I called around to the different departments/buildings, I was told that my relative was in the general holding area and that if I wanted to talk with my relative I "may or may not" be able to talk with them because the patients are the ones who answer the phone in the holding area and its up to the patients to get the phone to the person being contacted.  After no success during that first attempt I called back only to be shuffled around to all of the different departments again and even after initially being told that my relative was in the holding area, this time I was told in each department that my relative could not be located. The last employee that I spoke with literally said "yeah, I don't know what to tell you" when I asked about some type of solution.  I had to contact my insurance to get my relative moved to a different facility just for peace of mind.  Never again in my life will I allow any person that I care about to go to that facility, EVER!  I would rather drive to San Diego County in order to get them treated at another facility despite the problem than to subject anyone to this place!< /review>

Horrible place! Needs a major reevaluation of the staff and facility. Theres so many major violations happening here. Was so dirty and so unmanaged it was truly despicable.  The psychiatrist is utterly useless. Not to mention the staff is completely under qualified and just heartless human beings. I hope this place gets either shut down or has a major update. I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy.< /text>

I was a patient here 2x's...I was yelled at by a nurse to stop crying as I was put into a chair they call a bed..the floors were filthy, not swept or mopped AT ALL!! Hair, dustbunnies and garbage were around all the rooms corners and under 'beds'.. liquids have been spilled and not cleaned, so there were brown spots on the floor, they had a few minor children for psychiatric care in a room by the nurse station..children should not be allowed near adult patients..it's a disgusting place!!!! 1 star is being too generous<//Review>

I had a schizophrenic male like 7 years older then me (I'm 19) who was sexually harassing me and making sexual comments and wouldn't stop touching my shoulders or hair I kept reporting it to the nurses who said they'll watch me make sure I'm safe but he kept trying and trying and i felt so unsafe and ignored by nightfall I freaked out he slept across the room from me I was freaking out that they even had boys and girls together, anyways at nightfall I told the nurses once again I felt uncomfortable he kept staring at me smiling. They told me it's okay the lights are on and we're always right here. I woke up at 1am with the guy hovering over me ripping my gown I was screaming and fighting him off me the nurses were in the back socializing I had to had another male patient help me get him off me he even punched him. I started freaking out and crying and was upset that they weren't even aware of him getting up and walking half way across the room to do that to me like where the hell were you guys? Then I got threatened to be put under if I didn't calm down I was like are you serious? Worse experience ever I came out with more problems and depression. I give thousands of stars to one RN who use to cut herself in college you were so understanding and sweet you legit helped me to get out of that place and looked past my old scars you told me I had a bright future and that I will make a great doctor you gave me hope that day and made me realize there's a change for me thank you for not realizing I'm not overreacting. You are an angel and fit so well as a RN.</review>

NO STARS would be more accurate. I have to say this is a hell hole, a traumatizing horrific place. It is overcrowded ( mostly by homeless drug addicts, and alcoholics )  staffed by people who speak with thick, heavy, hard to understand accents. Most of the staff is uncaring, detached, unresponsive and neglectful, with some exceptions. There was only one psychiatrist for over 40 patients. I was wrongfully sent there ( from a phone conversation with a spiteful landlord who gave a false report to the police) and I was held illegally for 25 hours. The only reason I was discharged is that after 16 hours one nurse actually listened to me, verified my explanation, and urged the second doctor ( I had to wait 25 hours to see him) to discharge me, who after listening to me for 4 minutes did release me immediately. Conditions are horrible, no real beds except in 2 isolation rooms, no privacy, no one tells you what the rules are, but the first "doctor" I spoke to, after 4 hours of waiting for an evaluation, informed me that I would remain in lock up for a mandatory 72 hours and there is a possibility  of an additional 14 DAYS if I do not obey the rules. I asked her what these rules are, as no one had explained any to me. She ignored the question and told me there were 6 pages she had to fill in. She would not listen to any explanation as to how or why I got there. Diagnosed me by looking at my eyes and determined I had a mental illness based on that 2 minute observation alone. NO LIE that is what she told me. I questioned her diagnoses and asked her how long she had observed me. That is what she said really !! " I just now looked in your eyes"  This is not a proper or correct psychiatric evaluation by any standard or means. I do intend to file a malpractice suit asap. I also will be filing a suit against the police for false detainment. sadistic torturous treatment , human cruelty,  and whatever else an attorney can think of. AVOID this "hospital" with any and all the means you can. Most importantly never speak the "magic words" to anyone even in jest, or sarcastically, out of complete and utter anger and frustration. Lesson learned the hard way for me. Going to get therapy today for PTS.<//Review>

No stars if i could. Do NOT go here or put your family members here. It is hell. A filthy place with cruel insensitive staff that treat people in there like absolute dirt. You dont get the help you deserve at all, or even get checked on. You're stuffed in an over crowded room and left and ignored in a chair (if you're lucky enough to get a chair).<//Review>

<Review>This place needs major investigation . And major evaluation . This kind of place does not belong in the 20th century. EVERYTHING FROM The management  The staff the nurses the security. THE HORRIBLE FRONT DESK EMPLOYEEs all need to be fired and PREVENTED from ever working in any part of the mental health field . THIS IS TRULY THE WORST ESTABLISHMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN . THIS PLACE IS JUST A HOLDING CELL FOR DRUG ADDIICTS and homeless psychotic crazy nut cases that get horrible "treatment" from unprofessional, uncaring, uneducated, LAZY, fake nurses and staff . MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE COMMITED HERE BY STAFF ALONG WITH MAJOR HIPPA VIOLATIONS ...PLZ INVESTIGATE THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PLACE !!!!</Review><user>118126995739113689045< /user>< Name>

I only give it the one star because none isn't an option.
When I tried to read the admission paper work before signing, it was snatched from me and they wrote that I refused to sign.
I was attacked by staff, isolated and sedated FOR TELLING OTHERS ABOUT PATIENT RIGHTS. When I woke up in a hospital gown 16ish hours later, they told me they had cut my clothes off of me and given me a shower. My hair showed no signs of being wet.
There were many people, myself included, who slept on the floor for lack of what I will generously call beds. The few that that were offered, which far exceeded the number of occupants, were unsanitary because as soon as one person got up to use the bathroom, someone else would take their spot immediately.
The staff was inattentive, impatient, rude, judgmental, and just completely unprofessional. The doctors tried to play head games with their questions, often insulting my intelligence with their condescension. I was kept for weeks with no group or individual therapy.
The correct address and phone number were not provided or posted. You can't tell ALL the numbers were 9s and 0s.
From all of us going to school to get into the psychology field, I say shame on you all.</text>

I went to this facility for help. They not only did not help me, but I had to sleep on the floor for two nights, and would only be allowed to leave if I had someone pick me up, which was only possible if I signed for that. What I found out I was signing for was for the "doctors" (there are no qualified nor certified legal physicians at this facility- just frauds) to lie to - in this case my stepdad - the person who was authorized by me to pick me up. The  alleged doctors saw and spoke with me for no more than 5 minutes in 2 days and dismissed what I told them as crazy and prescribed me psyche meds which I did not fill nor would ever need or recommend to anyone. This place is a sham, a scam and should be shut down for criminal fraud and worse charges.<//Review>

<review>Listen to the whiners and crybabys writing these reviews!! I need the public who is reading this review, to know I AM A LONG TIME PATIENT HERE. SINCE 2013. It is a fact that any patient is allowed to leave AT ANYTIME, UNLESS police escort you here. The staff here are very professional, they go out of their way for everyone, STOP LYING!!! Ya. I get upset/ frustrated sometimes too, but the truth is the truth!!! Excptionally well trained, vibrant & pleasant atmosphere, professionalism is key here. Dr. Laura, Kimber,  Gracie & Eli deserve a raise!! Even when im mad at them, they do their job brilliantly. Get honest, mental patients. If i see any of you 1 stars at this facility, you need to run the other way.< /review><user_name>Dawn Riverside< /user_name><user_id>108873510622601477558< /user_id>< Response>

<text>As a combat vet, I went there seeking help for my PTSD. The staff was utterly rude. HIPPA violations left and right. Staff do not wear badges to identify who they are. PATIENT information sitting around in plan view with no attending staff near by. Staff also laughs at patients with mental disablities. Staff curses at patients. Also when asking to speak to someone, staff ignores all. Staff were having arguements in the common area. Very unprofessional medical facility.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I was there for about 7 hours, what a nightmare. Its a small room no place to lay down or to sit comfortably one bathroom and the " Guards" were not nice in fact I was yelled at me several times all I was doing was trying to find a place to sit. I was never more terrified in my life. I was transferred there from Riverside County in Moreno Valley because I had a bad case of diverticulus. So they        ( Moreno Valley RMC) would not give me my pain medication that I have taken everyday for over 20 years, they could have put it in my IV but no. I started to feel the withdraws and became restless this led to the transfer to hell RCRMC.

There is more but I do not want to write a book. Do not let your loved ones go there!</Review>

<Review>This is a nice, quick-stop place to eat. I always order the same thing, and it always comes out great. I used to experience a few customer service issues, however, I feel as if they are now better staffed and much more considerate. I will most definitely continue to be a consistent customer.<//Review>< pics>

Food was great,  but waited in line for 15 minutes just to pick up an order that was already paid for.  Maybe, should have two lines....one for ordering and other for just pick-up orders.</Text>

This place is disgusting,  the girl rang in my order , the other 3 customers orders handled the money,  took a phone order... Then used the Same Glove to grab my food and put i the bag with her dirty glove touching the food. I asked her to please have my food remade with clean gloves and she did the SAME THING how dumb do you have to be.... I tossed the food in the trash.< /text>

<rate>3<//rate><text>First time coming here, we ordered a 2 person meal with French fries, original boneless wings and Louisiana rub. We got them super salty. Everything’s from the fries to both wings were like dumped in salt. To me the original hot wings tasted like they just put some enchilada sauce on it and some vinegar. And the Louisiana tasted like they dumped the whole bottle of garlic salt in em. The wings also tasted dry from the inside. And lastly the whole room was filled with smoke that it  made my eyes hazy. Anyways probably won’t come to this reasturant no more. :)

<Review>DO. NOT. CALL. AHEAD. EVER.

This Wingstop isn't all that different from any other one. The food is acceptable. The dining area is smaller than other establishments. The staff is average. The staff gets the food out in a reasonable time, but the table and condiment maintenance is lacking. The main reason why I am rating this establishment so low is because of the disrespectful staff. 3 times I called ahead to make a take-out order, and ALL 3 TIMES I was put on hold for an unnecessary amount of time. After about 10 minutes of being put on hold, I hung up my phone. I called the place immediately and a different staff member answered and was ready to take my order. What kind of restaurant only takes orders from every other phone call? The place also got one of my orders wrong from one of my take-out orders. I won't be doing business with this place anymore, and unless something changes neither should anyone else.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Worse experience I've had in a restaurant. They didn't have clean tables, they didn't have no lemons, paper towels, and ketchup containers. The food seemed as if it was already been sitting there for a few hours. The seasoned fries were burned. They also forgot to give us one of our dressings and veggies that came with the our combo. The soda machine had no ice. So when I tried to put ice in the cup. It ripped. Didn't bother asking for the veggies or another cup. Since I had already asked for all the other issues I pointed out before and did not wanted to sound more of a d**** of what I already sounded. I rather drive twice the mileage for the one in Glendora.<//Review></record>

I’ve been coming here since it opened Very close to my house I love it awesome place food is always great and I’ve never wrote a review on here until today . I waited for my food for almost 25 minutes to dine in , most tables were very dirty , nobody seemed to be trying to hurry and get the orders out . I don’t think I will be coming back anymore< /review>

Employees are kinda pushy at this location asking me questions while im trying to look at the menu to see what we were getting. It does take about 10 to 15 minutes to get your food which is fine by me but the wings were so salty, I've never had salty mild wings before it was to much that we gave up and didnt even eat all our food. We got mild and lemon pepper boneless wings fries and cajun corn all of which was over salted or seasoned. Overall not a good experience and since it was our first wing stop experience we won't be returning since the food doesn't match the price you pay.</review>

I hate to give Wingstop low stars and a bad review, but lately with each visit it gets worse! I come here very often! The last few visits were not terrible but disappointing. My boyfriend and I love wings and were so excited when we found out Wingstop was opening down the street. I love that they make the wings when you order so they're fresh. My last few visits, I hate how dry and oily and flavorless the food has been. I have noticed that when certain workers are there the food is awesome. I wish they were consistent!</review>

They are inefficient because don't know how to be efficient yet and I also don't think they know how to make the sauces yet, either. I have been disappointed with all my favorite wings here. You're better off driving the extra 10 minutes to another location because you'll likely be on hold for 10 minutes and then go to pick up your food and they won't let you know it's ready even though you already told them you were there to pick up. That's happened every time I've gone to this location.<//review><user_id>111082892783984667307<//user_id></record>

Its good. Made fresh to order. I had a complaint they served me the wrong flavor, as I walked up to let them know a guy was in the corner eating a wing.... (Not professional) then he walked up to assist. I told him I got the wrong flavor he asked for my receipt he said it shows you ordered lemon pepper I said I asked for parmesan...and he replied but your receipt shows lemon pepper like really guy?!? For a second time I said I ordered parmesan Then he directed me to the cashier and she assisted.<//Review>

There were 3 young ladies who were working hard and getting things done. I ordered the Mango Habanero flavored wings and they were delicious, large, fresh and perfectly cooked. I couldn't wait to go back. So on 3/19 I did. First thing I noticed when I arrived was 4 young male workers behind the counter and they were all kind of just kind of hanging out. I ordered the Mango Habanero wings again but this time I was told it was a minimum of 10 to be able to get their special pricing. The order came out quickly this time and right away I could see the difference, they were smaller, with less sauce and were not fresh tasting. The order of 10 wasn't much bigger than my previous order of 5. If I go again it will only be when the young women are working.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1522177651934, 'text': 'Hi Philip,\n\nWe are sorry to hear that our restaurant didn’t meet your meal expectations.

Went on a Friday night, not very busy. This location is rather small but they have a good amount of tables. Monday's and Tuesday's appear to be the day to go because this location does 60¢ boneless wings on those days. My order was missing 5 wings but once I let them know they were quick to give me the next 5 wings they had made. They're pretty quick and the staff was nice. I'm dissatisfied with their flavors. There's only about a dozen or so and the Original Hot isn't very hot at all. It tasted mild and the next heat level up is Atomic which sounds intimidating but I'm sure it's lackluster as well.<//text>

Wings take a while to make- that's just typical Wing-Stop. Otherwise, service is decent and the place itself was clean, if not a little cold in vibe. Parking is a little sketchy and not plentiful. Otherwise, this is the place to go for those wings.</Review>

<text>This place sucks! Placed an order for 10 hot wings  cashier tells me 9 mins my hot wings will be ready. 10 minutes go by, nothing, 20 minutes go by, nothing I notice people who placed an order after me get their food. I figured they forgot my order no problem. Just give me my money and Im out no harm no foul. So they stall and cook my food real fast, no thanks. So the cashier finally gives me my money and I walk out with out the food. Never again. This place sucks!< /text></record>

Came here and had to wait a good 5 minutes to place an order and the place was empty, I was the only patron around. There was a girl taking a phone order and two more girls just hanging out by the counter not doing anything. Terrible service... Terrible<//Review>

Ordered a 30 piece boneless wings my order was all wrong i ordered hickory bbq, garlic and lemon peper wings. I don't know how i was the only customer in at the time so its not like they could have mis packaged it. I ended up with plain boneless wings, an order of tenders and the garlic wings. Anyways the manager Ceci gave me a courtesy call about it but staff should be a little more professional about their employment.</review>

The guy that was working tonight was excellent! He's super sweet kind thoughtful an out-of-this-world. He has a very respectful personality. This gas station is always very clean.< /text>

<Review>I use my shell app which saves me about 10 cents off every gallon, this shell is right next to my job and seems to be lower priced than any other shells in the area. The lot is always clean, and im always in and out. Pretty much all you ask for in a gas station, cheap and fast!<//Review></record>

Very friendly staff.  Instead of paying for air in your tires; just ask them and they will let you at no costs.  The less expensive price on Shell has around my area.  Cheaper then the Chevron a block down the street.</review>

Looking for a place that can take you to a Tuscany Garden ambiance  located in SoCal. This is one of my favorite venues to paint during weddings because all of the greenery and venue textures. The staff at 24 carrot is amazing and beyond professional. Highly recommend getting married at Franciscan Gardens< /text>

My husband and I are renewing our vows here. This place is absolutely gorgeous on its own. The old exposed brick of the building gives it so much appeal. You’d never know that this place is surrounded by a parking garage and other restaurants. Once you’re on the property, you’re fully immersed in its beauty<//Review>

I photographed a wedding here on a rainy day. The venue was super accommodating, moving all events to their inside space (not many venues can boast a plan B).</review>

Upon entry it was clear that we were in for something special. The bar served top shelf beverages and featured drinks. The live entertainment blended perfectly in the background.  We were lucky enough to be invited guests of a 24 Carrots hosted event.  We have been to many events where 24 Carrots catered and been incredibly impressed every time.  Last night was no different. The tables were beautifully set very formally. It was a five course dinner with countless servers tending to every detail. If you are looking for a venue for a special event, or to have your event catered in a way that's sure to impress,  you have to check out Franciscan Gardens and 24 Carrots!</Review>

<review>This is such a beautiful venue for a wedding! There is an indoor and outdoor area but the outdoor part is definitely my favorite. It can be used for both the ceremony and reception, but it's nice to have an indoor option in case of rain. My one complaint about this venue is the lack of natural light in the getting ready rooms (there's no windows) but that's a small detail and it wasn't too dark for pictures or anything. The San Juan Mission is located just down the street and is a great place to go for couples portraits on the wedding day. Overall my experience here as a wedding photographer was a good one! One other thing for anyone planning to come here - the venue can be easy to miss on your first visit as it is along a busy-ish street and to get to the parking area you pull into what seems like an alley but if you look for a sign, there is one that says "Franciscan Gardens" hanging on the front of the building.

<review>Attended a wedding at this location. The scenery was beautiful with this fountain and pergola. The foliage was pretty well kemp blocking you from the street and parking structure near by. Staff was friendly, bathrooms were nice and clean. We were only able to be outside due to covid, but there was plenty of room.</review>< pics>

Even though we did have a little bit of rain the venue was still beautiful outside. This is a wonderful place to get married and entertain your guests. We had roughly 150 people.

On the inside they have bride quarters as well as grooms quarters and a really big open space where you can have your reception or dancing or cocktail hour.

You can't go wrong with this facility if this is where you chose to get married.< /Review>< Pictures>

A very nice venue for having Wedding out doors.  A cozy place large enough to hold about 200 guest.  And they also have indoor setup for your banquet and receptions.</Text>

A great place for a wedding, reception or party. We attended a wedding and reception and I thought walking into the courtyard transports you somewhere else. There was one inconvenience, someone in the park across the street was really cranking their music and it was a distraction during the ceremony.< /review>

The little town here brings you back to a more cowboy like town. I def. think its actually a pretty perfect spot to get married at, your secluded but the decor is already all there with the fountain and chandelier.
It is a great consideration if someone is looking for a wedding spot!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Franciscan Gardens is such a hidden gem! As a designer and sales rep for Archive Rentals, I have the pleasure of partnering and providing for a number of clients hosting parties or weddings at Franciscan.  The venue and event managers, Melissa and Haley, are wonderful to work with, always so positive, organized and efficient!  Definitely the dream team!< /text>

<text>Love this place! My parents and I come here a lot. It’s super clean, they have great choices that they swap out often and lots of fresh toppings. The owners are so kind and lovely, so it’s also great knowing we’re supporting a wonderful small business! ❤️< /text>< date>

<Text>Even before this Pandemic Top it off Yogurt is top notch for its quality and variety of yogurts. The store is kept clean and they offer masks ( if you forget yours) and for sanitary reasons, naturally they have plastic gloves to wear while making your cup of deliciousness!!! The Owner Raj, is very professional as well as the employees that I have seen! Do not miss out on the best Frozen Yogurt!<//Text>< Pics>

Nice employee when I came in today but the flavors I got tasted just a little more off. Not a huge deal they weren’t gross just not what I expected. I’ll be coming back though.<//Review>

<review>Love this shop, Raj and Nikki! They have never been anything but lovely, hospitable, friendly and generous. The shop is clean, the yogurt is always yummy! These hard working people made it through these last 5 months. They have adapted to Covid policy in the best way possible. Thanks for being our occasional treat place!<//review>< Rate>

Help the kids help themselves to all the goodies you can top it with. Choose how much you'd like to pay for by keeping the weight low for lower pricing, or fill it up until you can't no more 😁<//review><date>1607883960519< /date></record>

Our family enjoys going here for frozen yogurt.  They have a good selection of flavors and toppings. They have a decent sized sugar free selection, which is great for those watching their sugar intake. This place is usually super clean, too. Yesterday afternoon we went and the machines didn't look too clean and the fresh portion of the toppings looked old and mushy.  There was a new guy working and he wasn't very friendly.  Hoping this was a one-off deal as we really enjoy this place. I didn't let this experience change my stars, as they have historically been great.<//Text>

Perfect little yogurt spot. It wasn't too busy or crowded at the time I went. The had several flavors and tons of toppings. I was happy to find the Eurotart flavor yogurt because many yogurt places do not have a plain sour flavor. It really hit the spot. It was not overly pricey, and the employee running the register was very polite and friendly. I would definitely return.< /Text>

Nice place. The flavors don't change very much. They keep like 5 staple flavors and only rotate out like 3 so not much variety but it's clean and they have a good choice of toppings.<//text>

Great local froyo spot with good outdoor seating and all the fixing you need  I especially like that they have non- dairy silk almond milk vanilla froyo instead of some weird sherbet-ish flavos like the other frozen yogurt places in town. 👍🏻</text>

This is a really good frozen yogurt place. They have tons of toppings and the prices are reasonable. I also love that it's super close to home. I just wish they had more flavors to choose from like menchies and waffle bowls.</text>

This one employee named Nikki wasn't very patient when i was paying with a visa gift card and seemed annoyed at me when i asked her for sample cups. Delicious ice cream, just not a very nice employee</Review>

<review>Great little fro yo place. Haven't had issues with out of service machines/flavors. Decent job with flavor cycles (really digging the tiramisu and creme brulee flavors). Always a good spread of sauces, fruits, and toppings. Place is always clean, even when I visit at busy times. Service is usually friendly, even when crazy hectic.<//review>< resp>

4.5 stars. Hmm where do I begin? Anyways, was down here for some stuff and a lot of people told me that this place was amazing, so I was like "I'll try it,". It was about 7 when I got there and there was a line outside the store. I was like," How long would this take,", but the line moved quickly( I would say there were about 10 people outside including me). It took about 10 minutes to get in. The inside is small, clean, and quite warm. Not many seats, but I guess most people just get out once they buy stuff. I was recommended by my friends to try the Macaron ice cream sandwiches that they had to offer( and yes I do like macarons). So I got the Red Velvet macaron sandwich. It was $6, and the size of your hand. Anyways, I took a bite and I was in love. The macaron shell was nice. It had the feet, was soft, but chewy, and delicious, though it didn't really taste like red velvet( it was still good though). The ice cream was delicious. Cold, sweet, creamy, perfectly molded, and had pieces of red velvet( I think). Half of it was dipped in white chocolate which made it more amazing. Presentation was also awesome! I would definitely come back when I am in the area. :) See ya soon!<//review>

Never going back to this place my siblings  and I ended up getting different flavors and added strawberries  my sister tried hers  before  we left and she said they tasted bad so I tried some and they tasted old so I told the lady and she said she barely cut them and I'm not sure if it was the manager or owner and also said the same thing he  tried one and said WE HAVE HAD WORSE honestly that's super nasty what's upsetting is they never said anything to fix the issue like you can remake your yogurt just kept saying they where fresh</text>

<text>A small mom and pop feeling yogurt shop. It has great yogurt and all the toppings you could ever want in a lifetime. The guy with the glasses was really nice and relatable. Although I couldn't see his name since his nametag was flipped around. The atmosphere of the place is meh. It feels too open if anything and there's no music in the background so any talking you do can be heard. The tables could be cleaned a bit better as well.

Still it's a nice place to sit and cool down on a hot day. 👍<//text>< time>

We have tried numerous other places just to see how they stacked up and we always come back to Top it Off.  They have the most inviting atmosphere and the variety of flavors there will blow you away.</text>< pictures>

<text>I visited in late July with an extremely last minute request to get my husband's ring engraved before our wedding that weekend. I didn't really think they could get it engraved that quickly, but they did! Thanks for making this happen, the engraving looks great and my husband loves it. And thank you for being so helpful with my last minute request!<//text><UserId.>114232710255034699825<//UserId.><Rating>5<//Rating>< name>

I have used Ropers Jewelers for over 30 years. They will always be my trusted jeweler now and in the future. I am always impressed with their selection, price range, lay away options and fabulous estate jewelry section that you must see to believe!

I have shopped at Ropers for several years because I receive excellent service and quality jewelry. Scott Neil and Royce have sold me beautiful items in a no pressure friendly and knowledgeable manner, making the experience professional and satisfying. I’ll return!!<//review>

<Review>This local jewelry shop is a pleasure to do business with. They do repairs for very reasonable amounts, and have a lovely selection of a estate and new jewelry. I only buy estate jewelry and I love the options that they have. The service is professional and friendly and it's in a great part of town to visit.</Review><rate>5<//rate><user_id>102012965744237254222< /user_id><Time>1564767276460<//Time><name>Chris Allan< /name><Response>None<//Response><pics>None</pics></record>

It is too bad there is not an opportunity to give a sixth star for the service and care that Roper’s has once again  tendered. I have been a customer for some time and will continue to be one so long as Peggy and staff render such quality work.
I presented two older well worn rings for repair and cleaning. I am glad she took photographs of them because when I reclaimed them they appeared as if they were brand new and still in the shelf. Thank You all so much for the precise quality of your work and attention to detail.</text>

My mom passed away about five years ago and left me her collection of jewelry. Recently I had started to wonder if any of her gold or gemstones could possibly have value, so I took several items to Roper's Jewelers for appraisal.

Even though they were in incredibly busy with Christmas orders, they completed the appraisal in less than two days.

Roper's provided an excellent written appraisal and discussed each item with me in great detail.

I cannot commend the staff at Roper's highly enough, and I will also mention that while I was there, I noticed many exquisite pieces of jewelry for sale.

Roper's is a "gem" in historic downtown Auburn!< /Text>

Years ago the center diamond in my wedding ring fell out.  Since then I have learned the importance of regularly having my rings checked and cleaned.  Roper's has been so dependable... I am never disappointed!   Very helpful staff!</review>

Scott was very patient with me and understood that I didn't want to spend lots of money on restoring the engagement ring but instead how make it look just like it did 30 years ago....Thank you so much for your time...

My Wife's ring was in the Paradise "Campfire"., Along with a ring left to me by my Father. Both rings were recovered from the ashes of our hose in Magalia.

Upon a recommendation from our very good friends, we took the rings to Roper's Jewelers in Auburn. The people there were outstanding in their compassion and professionalism. They restored my Wife's and Dads rings to a better condition then they were originally!

I tried to pay them for this, but they refused to take any payment! My heartfelt and sincere Gratitude to these Wonderful people!

I don't care we're I end up living, I will always come back to these Wonderful people for any and all my family's jewelery needs!<//text>

{'time': 1565829084699, 'text': 'We are truly sorry that you feel so wronged by Roper’s. As a family owned small business we make it our business to treat our customers as we would treat our own family. We know this is a time of grief for you, and we understand that our policies may not make sense on the surface. We certainly do not make a practice of “scamming” our customers. In the past we have had dealings with the settling of estates that have made us pay close attention to our own procedures. A death in the family is a tragedy that often brings the burden of financial responsibility. We are empathetic to that, at the same time we must be lawful in our practices of returning goods and refunding money. We wish you healing and peace at this time of loss.'}<//Response>

Scammers - My Mom had "chemo" brain and just passed away, found an antique gold bar w/receipt in the glove box of her car.  I went to Roper's to return it with the receipt and they said STORE CREDIT only!  Royce B (#36) was the salesperson, not hard selling to an old lady with chemo brain!  She passed away exactly 31 days after the purchase and the manager said because it's been over 30 days, not returnable.  I would NEVER shop here, please warn your parents, this jeweler is preying on the elderly!!<//Text>

Ridiculous prices.  Quoted me over $800 to set a stone in my existing ring.  They said I had a bunch of loose stones that needed to be fixed.  I took it to my "normal" jeweler in Sacramento, there were NO loose stones and they set the stone (yes in 14K gold as just needed a new prong set) for $175.  Also asked them to look at a few pieces (just check to see if they were 14K or 18K as the mark was not clear) and they wanted $35, would have took 7-10 days.  I walked across he street to another jeweler how said "sit down".  They not only looked at them through the microscope, did the acid test but also did another test with a new software system.  Took them 10 minutes and you guessed it..... they charged me NOTHING!!</Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I love this barber shop! I always get a great cut (even if I do say so myself) and the wait times haven't been to bad during the pandemic.

The barbers are always very careful to sanitize the surfaces and customer's hands before entering.

I recommend calling ahead of time to find out if they are busy or not.

The prices are very reasonable as well and a bargain for the quality.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcdeeb1262c96b:0x607be074d32eaedf</gmap_id><Response>None</Response><rating>5< /rating><Date>1606324638837</Date>< name>

<Text>Really nice staff,  Chris is a great barber and can fade like no other.   The place is a little hard to find but it's not impossible.

Especially for the price I make it a point to drive the 15 minutes here for the haircut. My favorite barber is Chris, been getting a cut from him almost every week or every other week for the past 6 months and never disappoints.</Review>< response>

The place is very clean, nice, great service, and they are all very professional. They did a fantastic shave and haircut. For me, this is the best place to have a haircut and a great hairstyle. The employees are very accommodating. They have different varieties of cosmetics which you can buy. I will recommend this place to everyone!<//text>

They are standing for long hours at a time so for those people who are nitpicking at the barbershop about their ATM or that they only take cash or that they don’t do haircuts well maybe they should go to a hair salon instead and pay twice or triple as much. At $18 their haircuts here are reasonable quick and clean. Make sure you tell them exactly what you want or show them a picture and they will make it happen. If you are not happy please speak up they are willing to listen and get your hair looking right. These people are genuine. I have gotten comfortable with them and I will not go anywhere else. Give them a try.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1572492927357, 'text': 'Hello Angel,\nThank you for the awesome review and appreciate your business been loyal to the shop for many years.

From the time you come close to this establishment, it’s sad and apparent they take COVID19 and YOUR life well enough to grow more hair to come back. I really think that Tina isn’t motivated by money. She just wants all her clients safe. She has imposed such strict measures and guidelines on a white board right out the front door.  I should have taken a picture of the sign sitting outside the shop asking people to add their name to a list and don’t disappear. The plaza where they are located has a indoor and outdoor feel and places to sit until Tina or Anjelica who cuts my hair since day 1! The best! I never leave upset with the art form she created on this ugly head. I still go with a face cover and still do a wonderful job. I took some biology classes and can see she’s like a Mom to her clients (Tina). First thing, “would you like something to drink” and the polite and humorous people. I love just going to see my favorite women. Is two haircuts a month too much. I will say this. It’s cleaned daily and with their social disability policy and wearing a mask makes the difference in me having a mullet or getting my hair cut and worry to death I caught the virus. The one place I can promise is if you read the sign and check in with Tina, she’ll get you in and out as fast as she can. Just be patient as this virus isn’t there fault. They are hurting like most businesses. This place gets a Grade A1 for compliance and having a plan in place. Thank you Anjelica for helping my head look a lot better and Tina. Thanks for keeping your clients and family safe. Do yourself a favor and just shoot them a call to see if they can squeeze you in before like it used to be. We live in a different world now. Just be patient like everyone else and you’ll be happy with the choice of coming here on your first time! I hope I covered everything. Please adhere to Tina’s COVID plan.</Text>

Took my son here for the first time. The staff was great! Very friendly and welcoming. They were FAST and efficient with my son's haircut. I was very impressed on how well the stylist cut my son's hair in such a short amount of time. Just told the stylist want I wanted for my son and she got it right the first time. My son was in and out within 15 minutes. I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to my family and friends.<//Review>

I’ve always had a fantastic experience as well as the best hair cut here!  Tina and Angie are outstanding but my very last experience was the very best customer service experience one could ask for.  Tina and Angie went out of their way to correct a mistake I made on my hair. I can’t be anymore appreciative of their prompt service and care. FYI - I come and get my hair cut from the Bay Area!!!!!< /Review>

<text>I get my hair cut here regularly, about once every month. My hair is difficult to cut and there's a lot of it. It's very thick and wavy and hard to manage. Nonetheless, they always manage to cut my hair perfectly. I always leave looking sharp. It's been about a year of me going here and no complaints on my part. They even have free water and snacks. call ahead and book an appointment, they're normally really flexible.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great haircut with a great price. The barbers are very quick and they do a great job cutting your hair. Can't go wrong here. It is behind a building so you have to go inside more and look for it.< /Text>

<text>Got a haircut for my son and I with Nancy. We had an appointment but while they will write your name when you call, they still operate as first-come first-served. The staff is very friendly. The haircuts were really fast but not great. This is not the place to go for a stylish or fashion haircut. It's a nice place to go if you just want better than do-it-yourself haircut without an appointment. The place can't be seen from the parking lot. Walk past H&R block and it will be on your right.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1554164544748, 'text': "Hello Paula sorry for the inconvenience you experienced with us.

<text>Most of the reviews are written by barbers and owners.
Inside of the shop was so dirty, hairs are everywhere! Customer service does NOT EXIST.
They will call you “hi, honey, we’ll be with you right now and ruin your haircut”
I would give this place -10 if I could.
They only take cash and not giving you a receipt, they forcing you to use the ATM there for paying extra fees. Avoid this barber shop.

We were waiting for an appointment to come in for my other Barber and I had my customer waiting because he was kind enough to let me finish my lunch. I was going to put my plate down and check the appointment book for you but that's when you decided to storm out in a hurry and didn't even give us a chance to communicate with you.

I have been going to this barbershop for more than 6 months and whenever I am there although they are busy, two ladies always greet and welcome me. They are polite and humorous that always make me laugh. In Irvine, I believe 18 bucks for a man's haircut is cheapest one and they have better skills than any other barbers in Irvine that I went to. I will keep going to this barbershop.< /review>

<review>Can't say more positive things about this place. Tina was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and proficient.

This place is a little hard to find, as it's inside a plaza within a shopping center. You can't see the store from the parking lot -- you have to walk past the Stone Creek Plaza sign and look to your right on the first floor.

Tina explained to me all the mistakes my last barber made -- spoiler alert: there was a lot. That's what I get for going to a really cheap, $8 place.

She corrected it the best she could and explained to me the best way to cut my thick, coarse, Asian hair. She was disappointed in my prior cut, which just shows how much she cares about her craft. Really cool to see. She said that they would love to have me back in the future, which was also very nice.

She even recommended a nearby Tiawanese place I'm going to try. And then to top it off, she gave me a tub of gel to aid my reeling, recovering hair.

Best barber I've ever had, by far. I know you read that in pretty much 40% of barber reviews -- seriously, do the math -- but this place it's actually true. I'll be back again!< /review>< rate>

Tina is the most precise barber I have ever had the pleasure to have cut my hair (what's left of it is mostly gray now).  She really takes pride in the work she does.  When I leave her shop no one ever notices I have just had a haircut but it always looks neat.  That is exactly what a quality haircut should be.
Prices are great - Tip generously!< /review>

I was looking for a new barbershop and I was so glad I came across this hidden gem. The staff here is extremely friendly and skilled at what they do. Being Active Duty in the Air Force and a Realtor, it was imperative that I have a clean cut. Oh boy, were my expectations exceeded by large margins. If I kept writing about this place you would have a novel and I am sure you get the point by now... All in all, this place is a must go. I know I can come here and get a cut with confidence.

I've been going to Tina for several years so clearly, I like how she cuts my hair. I always make an appointment which is easy by text and she is very good at keeping those appointments. She listens and has worked with me as I've slightly changed my haircut preferences on occasion. I recommend Tina to anyone in search of a good barber.<//text>

Eh. Did not really enjoy my haircut here; felt like I was being rushed out the whole time even though I had called in previously to ask when the next available appointment was. In the end I also didn't like my haircut, which I thought was too short. I had asked for it shorter on top. At first the person didn't shorten it up top at all; then when I asked again for it to be shorter up top she ended up buzzing it with clippers that were shorter than I'd liked. It really felt like a rush job, especially because I had asked if she could go shorter with scissors and initially said I didn't want clippers up top. They have water and it seemed like she squeezed me in though. Everything but the haircut was nice.<//Text>

< Review>
This is THE SPOT. Especially for those with the ever so troublesome Asian straight and thick hair. Tina is like the Asian hair GURU. Tina was SO much fun to listen too and chat with. Small little setup, perfect for what she is doing. She saw my hair and noticed all the things my previous barber screwed up on and did her best to fix it all and I can't complain about the end product. She's got a customer for life with me. Wishing you all the best Tina!

Best thing Tina said to me, "Don't worry, it's the holidays. I'm going to make sure you look good."< /Review>

<text>Just went to the new StoneCreek Plaza location that a few of the gang from the old University Park Barber Stylists just opened/relocated to.  Nice to see some of them back together in this nice cozy spot along Barranca. Saw Tina as she is my go to barber.  She knows what to do to give me a hair cut that I want.<//text>< Rating>

<Text>A true hidden gem. The best price you'll find anywhere near. Only 20 bucks for a great cut. I will definitely go back and suggest you give it a try.< /Text>< Pics>

MY barberette Tina was AMAZINGLY smart , professional , SWEEEEEET AS HELL and Very Funny !! I can't belive barbershop like this still exist! I was pampered here , treated like I was in a beauty spa not just a barbershop ! Nancy the other barberette is also really good in giving beardcuts ! I recommend this place to everyone who does have a regular barbershop they go to yet !
I give them 10/10 for the customer service and experience .( they have a free snack and water fridge )
10/10 for the prices !!! 30$ for :
the fade haircut&style AND beard trimming , lineup and cleaning !!

This place really takes care of you !!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Nice little place, the haircut was nice, I'll know for sure after my 2nd visit. It's only cash payment so be prepared and if not quickly ask her for mobile pay which nobody will let you know about, instead they will point you to the nearest atm or bank and you'll keep running here n there. The mobile pay will charge you $1 extra but will save you a lot of mental stress!
Employees try their best to be nice and 1 time that I went the haircut was pretty decent!< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Local and affordable barber shop for men.
I gave less than 5 stars for the following reasons:

1. Took 2 mins to cut my hair, no attention to detail, and all i said was “short” and she just started bulldozing. “Speedy” is not always good.

2. Already speaking to the next customer and I just sat down. They seemed to be way more concerned about pushing people through the door than actually providing a good service.

3. Assumed a good tip for 2 minute hair cut. I gave a 20, and she asked me back if I want the change back. I never felt bad saying “keep the change” to my hairdresser.

4. Holy hair everywhere. The lack of effort to cleanup lead the hairdresser to just use cold air blow dryer to clean up the cut  WHILE the machine cutter is going through my hair. I ended up with itchy load of hair in my shirt on my skin. Not pleasent.

5. I dont like the haircut.<//text>< Name>

<Text>Tina ,

New customer today, and I will be a returning customer. Best haircut experience I've had in my life thus far. The shop is inside the courtyards to the right, little bit hard to find if you dont know the area. Make sure to call ahead and make an appointment.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Tina is sooo sweet. Very welcoming. I was treated like a king. All this, plus she gave me an awesome cut.
Since I've never had a shave in a barber shop, I wanted my beard shaved off, I went for the full treatment. Justin was da man!!  He did a great job and even better than the shave was his pampering.
A very nice experience on a rotten day. Just what I needed.<//Text>< Pictures>

I was apprehensive at first but I was in the neighborhood. This spot caught my eye and I knew I needed a cut anyway so I thought "Yolo!" and handled. Got a classy taper fade from Tina! First time getting a cut by a woman too but this spot did it so crisp!! I'm coming back for sure. Thanks Tina!< /text>

Upon walking into The Hangar, I was mesmerized by the decor. I felt like I was in Disneyland California Adventure on Soaring Over The World! Such a cool place! Then I tried to the food... DELICIOUS! I was bummed they’d already run out of Avocado fries, so I didn’t get to try those. But aside from that, the food was absolutely delicious. And since I live somewhat far from the restaurant itself my food was cold  by the time I got home, and yet it was still one of the best burgers I’ve had in a long time. We also got a salad which was equally as good! I will be back, I’ve already bought giftcards for other people to go and experience the food! I’ll keep recommending it! Great place! Staff is super friendly also!</text>

First time trying the food here...but it was definitely a new experience, no servers...and they just expected us to know how to order...kinda weird. More instructions next time would be appreciated...the food however was worth the wait. Amazing! Definitely coming back.< /review>

Great food and a fun airplane ambiance that feels like Disney California Adventure Park! Our  favorite items so far are the char broiled chicken sandwich and the sweet potatoe fries! My husband and I enjoy eating here! We will be back again soon!< /review>

They ask you to order through an app, even though it would be faster for them to take your order at the register. It's totally backwards, apps are great for ordering ahead.   So, place my order and then I have to wait an additional 30min.  Maybe they are short staffed??  Won't be back,  too many other options in the area.< /Text>

Food was descent not a $20 hamburger and side good though.. burger was tough a little over cooked. I ordered loaded tots on the side and the cheese was like the canned nacho cheese.. the order was wrong so oh well did NOT get the burger with bacon I paid for.. just seems delivery orders should be double checked as I am not going back for $2 bacon.. not as good as five guys for  the extra$$<//review>

Ordered two chicken sandwiches through the QR code at Barrelhouse on a Wednesday evening. It took almost an hour to receive the food. Food tasted ok, but was not exactly fresh either. Would not order here again.< /Review>

Food was tasty and prices are fair. A wider beer selection would be nice. It was my first time visiting and when I entered two different employees looked at me; but said nothing. I had to approach the counter myself and ask for their process.<//Review>

Burgers where good. Tried the jalapeno Bomber and Spicy chicken. Just not a big fan of the crinkly fries, I prefer skinny fries. The buns was soft and moist.</Review>

Did not receive my full order then when I called they gave me the lame excuse they could not get into the system to give me a Refund.  This is twice !! I'm done.
( Update ) Management at The Hanger called me personally and went out of his way to make it right !  I really do like the food and was very frustrated but I will continue to eat there but WILL NOT use Door Dash !! Thanks Guys 👍👍
(Update#2 ) Well I tried to give The Hanger a second chance . Something needs to change with management at this Restaurant. I ordered the BBQ burger and they put Avocado on there that was so hard I could not bite through it . How could they not know when cutting the Avocado it was not eatable. I'm done with them !!!!

First time going there and found no one to greet me.  I finally figured out that the computers where for self service ordering.  During the ordering process it tells you to pick a random metal number.  HUH?  I'm looking around thinking to myself, metal number?  I don't see any metal number.   Never had that type of self service request before.  So I just put my phone number in.  Thinking maybe I'll get a text.  I've gone through  that before during covid. Order and then they text you when its ready for pick up.    I wait at the  " arrival" station.   The guy behind the counter asked what my number is as he seen me waiting.  I walked up and was in the middle of explaining to him what my order was when he rudely interrupted me.  He chastised me like a child not following directions.  He said all the signs show to pick a metal number or your order is defaulted.  Signs?   I look over at the computer station and I see one metal number left on the table next to the computers!  It was not there before.  You would think during covid and non busy hours this guy would be more appreciative to his customers.  I know this whole set up is different and theres different rules to odering and eating now but rudeness and downright unhappy work environment is unacceptable.< /Text>

<text>This place has a really cool vibe. I have been here twice. Both times I ordered their big Crispy Chicken Sandwich it tastes hand breaded and was consistently delicious. The bbq sauce is spot on amazing. The fries are always hot and seasoned perfectly. Their crispy chicken sandwich alone will have me coming back for more.
At first it is a bit awkward having to give the cashier your phone number to be sent a text when your order is ready. (Had to do this both times) There are tablets to the right of the entrance for quick ordering. It was on the pricey side as the burgers and sandwiches do not come with fries and a drink. It would be helpful if there was a combo option without having to pay the separate charge for adding both. There are a few vegetarian options on the menu such as a black bean burger, salads, onion rings and fries. There is a dessert menu with milk shakes and soft serve. The kids menu has a variety of entrees to match with fries or fruit. There is beer on tap with a rotating seasonal selection. The wait for the food was no more than 15-20 minutes. There is a small section for patio seating outside. Seating inside could be greatly improved there are some booths along the back wall, but most of the main seating feels crowded. Solid 4 stars.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmf9fZZyCWR7FouoEzOa4WuE5GAee7fkWb7_VT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMG8S9OUx49nSl2lpRxrZCJV4pEGaCV5zZ3mTK2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809443d8acf44c3d:0xc8716afb312c2cf5<//gmapID></record>

<review>This has to be one of the best burger restaurants In Fresno! There is a wide variety of menu options, from burgers, hot dogs, Reuben, chicken sandwiches, salads. Don't expect small servings. This is the kind of place, you grab of few of the guys, and expect huge servings with a cold beer, or coke. Also Vanilla Coke on Fountain! LOVE IT!  This place is definitely worth every penny you plan on spending here!  Next time I go I am gonna try the strawberry lemonade. The garlic fries, and loaded bacon fries are absolutely delicious. If you need to edit your order due to not liking things, and there is any confusion, the staff isn't afraid to ask, No one wants the wrong order sent out! Glad I stopped in and gave this place a try! My friends are going to be happy, when i bring them here and they get to try this restaurant!< /review>< name>

<Text>I got the western burger which was delicious 👌 fries were good and service was outstanding. A bit pricey but well worth the money. The joy and excitement on my kids face when they saw all the airplanes and props was, priceless.

You order your meal on a touch screen system while being extremely user friendly. They have a compact and organized menu - so it’s not overwhelming debating what you want to eat. Ketchup/mustard, utensils, etc are readily available should you need them. Now for the good stuff: the food. For two people it came out to just over $30 (of course, we had to upgrade the fries). But it was worth every penny spent - the food was flavorful, juicy, and not too greasy! And that Hangar sauce... so good and has a slight kick of heat to it.
We ranked this place above Red Robin and Mad Duck.
(And for the Disney fans....very strong SOARIN’ feel to the place 🤩)< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>A bit pricey but the food was delicious, wanted something to eat before me and my wife caught a movie and noticed this restaurant was new to the area, ordered a chicken sandwich and a drink my wife had a bacon cheeseburger and fries that we shared, kind of cool that when your order is ready they send you a text message, picked up our food from the counter man my burger was on point! A huge juicy slash crispy piece of chicken under a bun I'm not mad at all, it was good I liked their hanger sauce that came on it too, didn't try my wife's burger but she said it was delicious, for both burgers, 1 french fry, 2 soft drinks it came out to $30 this is a nice spot to eat at while your waiting for your movie to start I wouldn't mind coming here again to watch a football game they have a 2 TVs plus they serve beer< /review></record>

< review>
We came in about 15-20 minutes before closing, thought they were closed as no customers were inside. One of the workers opened the door and told us they were still open and to come on in. They were cleaning the kitchen and grill and we said never mind don't want to inconvenience them. The workers said it wasn't a problem and to go ahead and order. Very nice staff and they were quick getting our food out to us! Food is also amazing! Thank you for serving us!</review>

<Text>Pretty excited to try this when I heard about it coming to Fresno.
The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seatings has misters, so even when sitting outside isn't so bad when it cools you down. The interior design is neat, going with a plane theme.
You order the food and they will ask you your number so they can text you when your order is ready.
-FOOD REVIEW: I ordered the Hangar burger and a side of fries. The burger was phenomenal! I really like how they put the burger together. It wasn't messy and it was great tasting. The patty was cooked perfectly and wasn't dried. It comes with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and pickle. Really enjoyed it a lot. The fries came out hot and crispy and was seasoned well. If I'm in the mood for some fast food burger and I'm in the area, I'll be coming back here.</Text>< UserId.>

Upon first glance, I initially thought The Hangar was your run-of-the-mill chain restaurant that just ended up in Fresno. By the end of my meal, I realized how wrong I was.

The Hanger is exclusive to Fresno and owned by a small business owner. It specializes in carnival-type food and was inspired by Disneyland's soaring over CA ride. On the menu you'll find American comforts ranging from Bacon Cheeseburgers to Chili Dogs to Banana Split Sundays. Around the restaurant, you'll notice plane themed bars, fans, and decor. Theres even a huge mural, done by a local artist, that you can take a pic in front of that makes it look as if you've just parachuted into town!

All in all it was a really good a experience and the food was just as I expected. Nothing more, nothing less. The Tri-tip sandwich is a must-have. They make their own bbq in-house and it reminds me of a tangy sweet sauce similar to the BBQ sauce found in Lucille's BBQ chain. I also ordered a chili dog since I'm a fan of all things hotdog. The chili was a savory meat based chili and it sat over an Angus dog on a bulky bun. I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife, but I finished every last bite. I also saw many people ordering milkshakes and sundaes. Those people told me that next time I'd HAVE to grab one as they were also delicous.

The service was also very smooth. They use a smart system that will text you when your order is ready. I found it to be very useful as I could shop around and didnt have to hover around the food counter. The staff, called flight attendants, were also very very kind and helpful. They routinely came around to the table asking if anyone needed anything and cleaning up small spills.

In conclusion, I'm glad Frenso finally got something fresh and orginal in the from of The Hangar. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling from out of town or any local looking for something tasty and unique.<//Review>< pics>

Great burgers and fantastic garlic fries.
This is one of my favorite places to eat. They make wonderful tri tip sandwich. Make sure to add veggies. I like the food much better than that other place close by.</text>

Tables are kind of close to each other you can see in people's faces they don't know what is available and ask, "is this available" since the tables are too close. As for the food the wester bacon burger woah!  amazing flavors and textures. The bacon, onion strings add great textures to the burger and the creamy avocado adds that rich smoothness!  Highly recommend the loaded fries! Wings are delicious very crunchy and under average in size. Not your typical and boring buffalo sauce it has a great spice to it. Unfortunately they didn't toss the wings in the sauce, maybe because like I said it is not your typical buffalo sauce. Next time I will definitely ask them to do so. Small but great selection of beer. Aubrey gave 10/10 service. The chopper chip skillet had a little wait time almost 20 minutes and next definitely I'll pass on the whip cream.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Why does nobody complain about 5 guys? This place beats them 100%. $10.80 for fries and a burger. 5 guys would’ve charged me double. Food was amazing and the place is super cute. Never going to 5 guys again this is my new place.< /review>

Second time here and the first time we had a burger that was over cooked so much it was dry and crumbling as we tried to eat it. Everything else was done quite well. We came back again today and asked to have our burger cooked medium and were informed that they could only cook it well done. Not sure why we can’t have a burger cooked to at least medium and for the price and their advertising of their special burger blend I’d expect to be able to get a burger cooked to order. The tri tip was good nothing special and the wings were great. Not happy about the burger but it is what it is....</text>

<Review>Friendly staff. The first time I went the food was very delicious and on point the burger was flavorful and the fries were cooked fresh. The second time I was alittle disappointed I ordered the same meal and everything was very salty. The burger patty and my fries were not cooked well it wa soggy. The place has a beautiful interior.</Review>< pics>

<review>They're OK... and that's if I'm being polite. Honestly, it felt like 5 guys and In & Out got a divorce, and "The Hanger" is the child that wants to impress them both... they're main thing is burgers and fries, but they over exaggerate things and it's just feels wrong. Even the rest of the menu doesnt taste like it should (hot dogs, wings, salads, etc...) all the while pushing they're "exclusive" made sauce. Its almost as if they are trying too hard to impress both of their separated parents in trying to be a fast food/sit down kinda restaurant.< /review>< pictures>

Where do i start? Went to this place hoping to satisfy my appetite. I was wrong! While ordering the cashier took forever because she couldn’t find the correct options for burger add ones in the POS system. While waiting watched the lady who ordered before me send her fries back because they were cold. Same lady sent her corn dog back cause it was raw. My order is finally ready after witnessing customers send their orders back. I informed the cashier to bag it to go at the time of ordering, everything comes out as if I’m a dine in order. Fries had sat out for at least 7 minutes prior to my burger being ready. I’m assuming the manager comes up to the counter yelling at kitchen staff for dropping cold corn dogs and yells to remake a burnt corn dog major turn off! So the counter person handing out orders dumps my fully loaded fries upside down in a container so all of the cheese and extras toppings are now all over the container. I should have checked my order before leaving! I get home 20 min away and it’s absolutely wrong! Ordered the bacon burger no bacon to be found how that happened amazes me. Only thing they did get right was refunding my money, they offered to take care of my next visit but I won’t be going back!< /Text>

This is the best restaurant in Riverpark!! They have such a good variety of food, so much to choose from, you have to come back and try the next item!! They have everything from burgers, tri-tip (which I think is better than doghouse), chicken sandwiches, salads, hot dogs, wings, so many different fries, and many different desserts to choose from including signature ones like the first class sundae which serves 4-6 people! Everything is mouthwatering! The environment is so wonderful too! They have the best team providing amazing customer service, willing to do whatever to make guests satisfied! The restaurant is very clean too! This is the place to go that exceeds every expectation! HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking a visit!<//Text>

Great addition to Riverpark! The restaurant is spacious and has a very cool aviation theme! All of the employer’s are in character as Flight Attendants, and the managers are Captains! They have a large menu with more aviation-coined terms. When my family went in, we ordered burgers, tri tip sandwiches, and loaded fries! It was delicious! Very friendly staff and not too bad of a wait time (10-15 min) and definitely a place to check out!!< /Review>

If you want to get your money's worth, go somewhere else. Pretty pricey for basic American food (burgers, wings, hot dogs)</Text>

$21 for a salad and a drink. The salad could have easily fed three people, it was a waste. I thought it was a sit down restaurant. Probably won’t go back. Strawberry lemonade was bomb though.<//Text>

<review>Burger was good fries were ok. Kids meals are huge, one meal could have feed both my kids.  It was also a little pricey but the biggest disappointment was that I'm eating in a aviation themed restaurant and all the TV's are blasting football.< /review><Time>1567976581238< /Time>< pictures>

Visiting a restaurant with a multigenerational family can be tough. Ok, I hate it🙁The older generation wants great food and the littles want someplace fun and quick 🙃😁🙃. This place was a very happy medium. As a hangglider nerd, I LOVE the decor! Cool stuff to look at everywhere✈️The layout of the restaurant is different than most places, and that's a good thing! The biggest surprise was the food! Salads were loved all around, but the burgers....the burgers!! Juicy, yummy burgers and crinkle cut fries... Who could all for more?  I'll be back soon (without the fam) so I don't have to share my fries 😁

< Review>
The disc golf course is fun and a good place to practice throwing a putter from the tee. There are still some challenging shots for experienced players, however. Also, the high voltage power lines crackle overhead for most of the round. I wouldn't want to spend too much time playing here.< /Review>

Has a lot of things to do including; 2 playgrounds, a disc golf course, horseshoe pits and volleyball. The lack of permanent bathrooms is the main drawback of this park.</review>

This park is nice and I like the fact that there are two playground areas. One for smaller children and toddlers and one for older children. Unfortunately, we have come here several times and there are never any kids here playing. I think this is due to it being slightly hidden from the road and there is not any good parking other than on the street. There is still lots to explore here and it makes for a fun few hours!</text>

But it's still one of my favorite places. Theres also a nice playground for kids and a paved walking path. My favorite part I have to go back for, is this short hand built pump track/jump trail on the park grounds. Guy that builds it said he's still expanding on it and changing stuff too.
Only 4 stars because the power lines are kind of ugly and if it's busy you have to watch for kids on some of the disc golf holes.</Review><gmapID>0x809ae4705ec94545:0xa4efde8f1827cf59</gmapID><user>103185935507769341825<//user>< Pictures>

Great area for walking around in a less urban areas of Folsom! Disc golf course is uncommon and cool. Built on a hill though so some areas like the volley ball court are harder to get to because they are at the top of the hill.<//text>

Love this park and its many connecting trails. Used to come here several times a week when we lived in Folsom and my son was little. Great to come back periodically for a flash of nostalgia and to give my son perspective of how things appear over time. Great times< /Review>

This is a Great Place. Oh my gosh, they have a 9 hole Frisbee golf course, volleyball net on a sand field and 2 horseshoe pits. They have a great play area for kids with swing sets and monkey bars. There is a lot of grass and BBQ pits There is also a wheelchair accessible lavatory. Very popular with kids and adults alike. Popular place to walk your dog.</review>

Lots of walking paths, ultimate frisbee couse, play structures, beach volleyball court, and park areas with benches and grills. It's far enough away from the street to feel better about small children playing.<//review>

<time>1467742232921< /time><rating>4<//rating><Text>An interestingly shaped park. It doesn't have much in the way of "grass" but does have a fairly quiet play area. The play area for the kids is small so two families would make it feel packed, but it feels sort of secluded hidden up the hill and in the trees. It is a bit of a walk to get to the play area, but it isn't bad. It's actually quite peaceful and due to it being at the top of a hill, you can get a really nice breeze. There is a bike path that runs through the park which goes quite a distance. I have never walked it to see how far it goes, but I suspect it is connected to most of Folsom via other bike paths.< /Text>< Pics>

Nice park nestled in the Briggs Ranch development. There's street parking. You climb a little up a small hill to the two playground areas. The park also has two volleyball courts, barbecue grills, horseshoe toss set up, and a port-o-potty. Nice view of the surrounding hills. There are bike paths/walkways that connect to other parts of the neighborhood and the other city bike paths. It hasn't been too crowded the handful of times we've been there. Great place for the kids.<//Review>

<text>Brunch at the Vestry was one of the best experiences I’ve had. The food was spectacular all around and the outdoor tent was well heated. Drinks were well made and service was prompt and friendly. The breakfast calzone and the shakshouka were sleeper hits. Fried chicken and the donuts also amazing<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPD5ctliXprwwm5N6d4NhGpm243PWtvhgzVNuLS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdjSu97M3K6ZU-RUandPtoesCRbbXL_5kAyyjJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVW3OPcgAVtOycN9eNomYLMg3K0sjW22vfNVQd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBBKx7PO4rg_PbwNxsw5xUvK7h-JyFbFxBPsB3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh2h83XVfjfdwq1511GlKfRvWFri_Vl0ZnuR6r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Not the best place IMO as there are a lot of better spots in the Mission area. The outdoor seatings are way better than the indoor set up. Inside is way too dark during day time hours for a normal breakfast/brunch. Drinks and food are ok, nothing impressive. Friendly and fast service.</Text>

Very cool place. I was impressed with how big it is and the outside seating is very cool for warmer nights. The theater is a unique experience that I need to do, I'll come back to watch a movie and have diner. Another awesome spot on Valencia St! food was good too. Service very friendly.< /Review>

<Text>Went to the Vestry for the first time this weekend and had a really great experience! It will def become one of my regular brunch spots in the mission. They have a lovely outdoor area as well as the indoor area. The bottomless mimosas are only $14 with food or $16 without food. The atmosphere is reach nice and the waitstaff were fairly attentive. The food was pretty good---didn't blow me away but def solid brunch food. I had the eggs benedict with avocado instead of ham and arugula instead of breakfast potatoes (I also appreciated that they were pretty accommodating with substitutes). But I would highly recommend the breakfast potatoes which were roasted in sea salt and rosemary and were oh so delicious! I also tried the flat bread---which I wasn't impressed with. The crust just didn't taste very good. All in all, I would def return--especially for a boozy brunch!<//Text>< Pics>

Came here for a dinner and drinks with my coworkers! The cocktails were great - I asked the server what his favorite cocktail was and he recommended the Lady Guadalupe. I'm glad I listened because it was delicious! Don't be intimidated by the habanero - it's not spicy at all. I tried all of my coworkers drinks too and they were all yummy as well. The food on the other hand didn't really do it for me. The burger was just okay. The ambiance + cocktails make this place worth it. Down side: service was slow even prior to the bar/restaurant getting busy.<//Text>

Second visit so far. First was an early dinner now I tried Brunch.

Their burger is just excellent, nice brioche bun, very good fries and pickles.

The French toast was very good but super sweet. Get the sauce on the side.

Duck confit hash was OK.

Full liquor license and great cocktail list seals the deal</Review>

The Vestry is a great brunch spot in the Mission, especially if the sun is shining and there is room on the patio.  A reservation is a good idea or show up when they open to get a good table.  I had the cowboy breakfast which was excellent as well as their bottomless mimosas which no one can complain about.  Everyone's food came out quick and delicious. Service was very friendly and prices were reasonable for the city.  I would certainly recommend.  Casual atmosphere.< /text>

The benedict is delicious with beautifully poached eggs, the bananas foster french toast is TO DIE FOR! Sunny (depending on the hour) outdoor seating available and it's still under the radar so there is no wait to be seated.

The Vestry is great for two reasons. The food is excellent, and they can accommodate larger groups at short notice. So if you have an impromptu group dinner and need a reservation try The Vestry.</text>

The place has a very young vibe, with loud music and informal layout. They have a nice patio outside, and a cool brunch menu. Food is good but definitely not other worldly, and the service could be a bit nicer.

Definitely worth a visit!< /Text>

Came here before our concert at the chapel. Food was pretty good, but service was Soooo slow. One waitress serving everyone and would forget who she helped. I went up to ask if we could order and after another 5 minutes I watched her go to the wrong table and ask what they wanted to order, and then remember it was my table that asked.</Text>

Possibly the best fried chicken in the bay area. And great drinks on top of that. Check it out.< /text>

<Review>This place was pretty good.

The pros -
The outdoor area was awesome. super cozy and chill.
The drinks were amazing - I had a bourbon/apricot liquor drink that was delicious, and my gf had a tequila/habanero drink that was also very good.

The cons -
The food was very average<//Review><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f7e3d1eeffe9b:0xa677b24ce389ea7a</gmapID>< Pics>

<review>Promising new brunch spot on Valencia featuring all you can drink mimosas, cornbread eggs benedict and an outdoor patio. We arrived on a Saturday around 1PM for brunch and had to wait around 10 minutes at the bar. The interior is somewhat dark and moody, while the enclosed outdoor patio is quite glorious in sunny weather. I recommend the eggs benedict and don't scrimp on the home fried potatoes. They were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.< /review>< Pics>

Went for happy hour on a Tuesday. They had $1.50 oysters, which were delicious, and good cocktails (although very $$). The rest of the menu looked good, but everything is pretty pricey.< /review>

<Text>Nice restaurant that is very large with many rooms, and some outside seating.  The brunch menu had some interesting twists to the traditional dishes, like eggs benedict and lux flatbread.  Our waitress today was off, getting two out of our 4 things we ordered wrong.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
We stopped by for weekend brunch on the Vestry's outdoor patio. It's part of, and adjacent to, The Chapel, a sweet little music venue on Valencia between 18th & 19th. There is indoor seating as well, though it looked too dark and intimate for a sunny Sunday afternoon. We were seated in about 10 minutes; however service was unfortunately very slow - it took about 25 minutes from the time we were seated until someone took our orders. Luckily, the food came fairly quickly. The shrimp po-boy was tasty, if a bit bread-y. The accompanying slaw salad made up for the skimpiness of the shrimp. The homemade yogurt was a true standout, served in a mason jar, with granola, persimmons, and honey yogurt (which could be replaced by hemp seed or almond milk). The brunch prices are comparative to the area, at ~$8-$12 for most items. Tip: brunch selection is really more like lunch, meaning those who crave egg dishes and french toast may be disappointed.< /review>

<Review>My Take: the Chapel's restaurant offers savory dishes and drinks | Went For: pre-theater weekday dinner | The Vibe: music lovers, concert-goers and Mission hipsters | Special Dish: Mussels (so juicy and plump), Cookies and Ice Cream dessert | Avoid Their: n/a | Price Point: most drinks and appetizers are under $15.00 | The Service: the communication with our waitress was a bit shaky but still a decent experience | Reservations: recommended for the dinner times | FYI, FRIENDS: make it a night of your visit and check out a concert next door after dinner -- Eat up, Kimmie<//Review>< Time>

Reason for score:
Quality of food: 5 - Caramelized cauliflower flatbread was delicious, nice wines by the glass
Atmosphere: 5: - Dim, cool lighting, nice place to chill
Service: 4 - Servers were reasonably attentive and friendly
Value: 4 - Prices were fair, particularly for San Francisco
Bottom Line: I don't live in San Francisco, but it I did I could easily see myself hanging our here on a regular basis.</text>

Every bit of service was some sort of mis-step...from beginning to end.  The food wasn't nearly good enough to make up for it.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Good place with terrace, the terrace is closed early, at 10pm "Not to disturb the neighbors". The bar area inside is also very comfortable, on Wednesday I visited there was live music.

Buen lugar con terraza, la terraza la cierran temprano, a las 10pm "Para no molestar a los vecinos". El área del bar adentro también está muy agusto, el miércoles que visité había música en vivo.<//Text>

If you're planning to go to Antelope Valley Mall, the best spot to park at is by Macy's, either side. We also enjoy a brief walk on their halls to go through the other parts of the mall. They usually don't have the items that we're looking for, rarely they have it online too. But that does not mean they can't give 5 star service and quality products. They have a wide variety of branded goods so you can feel good of yourself. Avail of their cards to get discounts. We're not rich but we can afford their offerings via discounts and sales. As a matter of fact, if something is available on other shops in that same mall, Macy's gives them on discounted price. Who doesn't love that?< /Review>

The store was clean and well-maintained.
Prices were higher than I expected after all this time. The sale prices on Levi's were good, though. I hadn't planned to go to the mall and wasn't really dressed for it (still had on pandemic-wear and was picking up food for some friends), and when I walked in the employee that greets you near the doors made me feel very uncomfortable. It reminded me of the scene in Prwtty Woman where she gets kicked out of the boutique, though I was not kicked out. Expensive store that makes you feel badly about yourself. I won't be returning there for a good long time!
(As an aside, the Macy's app is poorly designed, works very slowly and says things are not available at the location you are in even while you're holding it to scan the barcode. That's a comment better made on the app site but I put it here too since it deals with the store.)</Text>

I'm so disappointed with Macy's right now I purchased some pre-sale items they were suppose to deliver them to me. I received a notification saying the items were delivered but I never heard no one at the door and my items were not outside. And Macy's said they can not replace the items. Because it says delivered!! I'm so mad they do not want to be accountable for my items!!</Text>

Macy's is one of the best places for your wardrobe and accessories needs. Most times you can find all that you need on sale at great prices. The customer service people are friendly and helpful. I shop in the store and online for myself and for gifts for friends and family.< /text>

<text>Its been about three times that I've had issues were i have employees hounding around me again and again while im looking at merchandise. To be asked one time in a polite matter if i need help is one thing but that is not the case these women need a class on not running customers away instead of letting them shop in peace I spend good amount of money there in all departments and dont appreciate this treatment always catching them looking my way even from being away .</text>< Pictures>

Our sales woman in the jewelry department was amazing. We were looking for a new watch for my fiance and she helped us look at 20 different ones before we settled on the best option. When she was ringing us up, she even found a better discount on it and hooked us up. I forgot her name, but she's amazing!!! Go down there and look around. I'm sure she'll find you.<//Review>

Expensive but when you find the right timing for their sale, u can actually get good deals for good brands. I came across some rude staff but most of them are nice.</review>

I usually find what I'm looking for here. They have a lot of designer bags and nice formal shoe section. They also have an athletic footwear Dept. Their makeup departments are good. It's a much smaller store than other malls which is reflected in the selection of clothing.<//review>

I was there so seek out plane, gold heels for a wedding to match my dress and they did not have a selection at all. They had gold heels with a lot of diamonds but I was looking for plane, gold heels. The prices are too expensive too. They whole mall is expensive actually. Anyway,  I found really nice heels at Dillards. They have at least 4 different styles of plane, gold heels. That was nice.< /Text>

My to-go for sales if you have a credit card use it pay it off by the end of the month and you will get huge savings. I recommend you go on Friday to check out Saturday sale.</Text>

<Text>I wasn't planning a purchase when I went in today. The fella at Finish Line was so informative and helpful that I walked out IN a new pair of shoes.
I was though, a little disappointed at the handbag selection. It seems to have decreased quite a lot. The selection was really limited.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Date>

Awful customer service, specifically in the fragrance department. We have never once gone in there expecting to spend less than $100 and each time we stood without assitance for 5+ minutes, or were made to feel like we were stupid and didn’t know the fragrances that we liked. This last time, we asked for a specific fragrance we knew was available online. When asked though, the attendant said the fragrance was discontinued, said ‘Yeah, sorry.’ With a straight face and walked away. Extremely rude and unhelpful overall.</Text>

<Text>This is a great upper end department store. Perhaps this store could sell items without such an expense, if they would only learn how to improve their processes. Way too many colognes and makeup kiosk stations. It can get confusing walking behind the counters when you think it's an aisle way.
I prefer the Simplicity and lay out of Penny's when looking for colognes and perfumes.
I have to ask where everything's out in this department store which is not a good thing. I came here looking for koolaburra by uggs and they were sold out.
I used to buy my suits here, would have gone elsewhere due to overpricing and lack of selection. The store does have most items you were looking for but at a more expensive price.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I don't know if it's all the staff but the last time I was in there, I was treated very poorly. I tried to exchange a Christmas gift for a bigger size and the associate told me they don't sell that brand there even though we were standing right next to a whole section of that brand with the brand name ON THE WALL. When i pointed out that it was there, she just gave me attitude and gave me merch credit.  I doubt I'll ever spend it because there's a chance I'll see her again< /text>

<review>While I typically shop in stores down the hill (major malls n the Los Angeles area), I am always comforted by the fact that a Macy's is also up here in the AV. A great source for that last minute item that  might need. Although the fact that it is a smaller Macy's, it appears that they do not stock as many items as an L A Macy's would. Shoes appears to be an issue, for example,  I could walk to the shoe department and ask an associate to bring me out any men's size 13 shoe (not sneakers, but casual/dress shoes)... and I mean ANY size 13 men's shoe...  The last time I asked, I first got the slight head tilt, the sympathetic smile, followed by the head shake saying "no, sorry"... (to be more specific, just checked online ("Pick up in store") right now and while they do have 12 items in mens' shoes, size 13... They are 11 pairs of sneakers + 1 pair of sandal/thongs...).
Size 13 is not that rare, is it? Is it???<//review><gmapID>0x80c259a27e721dc9:0x3b7499ea7c87e482< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I did some shopping last thursday at macy's at the woman's department and I had some real problem with my credit card. Hopefully the young sales girl with some biker tattoos kept cool and got finally a way to manage the payment. That was a big relief on my side! She did an excellent job!
By the way, she was wearing some gorgeous high heels!</Text>

<text>VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH MACYS AND THERE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WAS DECLINED TO USE MY ACCOUNT AND WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH DETAILS OR INFO ABOUT WHY MY ACCOUNT IS NOT AVAILABLE. THEY JUST TURNED ME OVER BY SAYING NO WE CANNOT ASSIST YOU. I ASSURE YOU I WILL NO LONGER HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH MACYS. THEY MADE ME FEEL EMBARASED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE THE ITEMS I WANTED AFTER BEING AN EXCEPTIONAL CLIENT OF THEIRS. I HAVE BEEN BRINGING BUSINESS TO MACYS BY USING MY ACCOUNT AND FOR THEM NOT  SOLVING THIS MATTER FOR ME IS VERY DISSAPPOINTED. THE WORSE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD SO FAR OF ALL RETAIL DEPARTMENT STORES. I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE TO SHOP HERE AND THEY DISCRIMINATE  YOU AND DONT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.<//text><username>Nancy</username><userid>112845270207039257659< /userid>< Gmap_id>

False Advertising!!
Price tag said $149 and a sign displayed 30% and "special price" for $85.
The cashier asked manager and he came to remove the sign. Additionally he said "it's last weeks special and customer's mess around with the sign". He did not honor the price.<//Text>

I went to get the same Levi's that I was wearing.  They did not have them.  There was no one around to help answer questions.  I ended up just leaving.  I was a little angry.<//review>

Like many chains this location suffers from employee stagnation and indifference.

The clothing is mostly overpriced, but it seems their makeup section is what keeps them in business.</text>

I usually can find everything, I need when I'm going to Macy's, but this time, I was a little disappointed I couldn't find my Giovanni's organza perfume there, which is sold at most Macy's but this one here in the Antelope Valley at Palmdale but not to worry they were able to order it for me and have it shipped to my house which made me forget about my disappointment of it not being at the store thanks Macy's< /Text>
