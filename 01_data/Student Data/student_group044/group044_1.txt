<Review>Not an expert in Mediterranean food at all.  First time here and unfortunately, was surprised as to how simple and kind of "messy" display of lunch buffet. I know $12 buffet is inexpensive, but I still like things to seem organized and delicious.  The  chicken was tender and. good tasting, the fish was blend.  Okay salads.  No hummus for lunch, disappointing!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcyUIdYjAA2wPjdh5qgmHwXO_NojgheqhXY5xw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_sE2dTWUK3kIGl-IKIrpSRsOTFtV9EYoFdaod=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjvBrN3nXDdTkZkMfotWxJR-d1OfckQWUmZalP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCgouLIsmsK498lAqZcOeRP_wx2vFUEjioxRE4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF1zLyO5B1vW0fEMjMJhnDhR-jsHL0fK__Fgnr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs7qeqU8VNqU0aPjOE0pR2cwHKviq6Wv_N75_p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkDU9nDqlkP6zQeuGL2QpFK_tg_RtgMm7RZDqt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<review>We came here expecting very basic Mediterranean cuisine.  A lot of them out here tend to taste the same unfortunately.  We were very pleasantly surprised how fresh and flavorful the food & appetizers. We didn't try the buffet but even that looked very tasty. The service was great the guy explained everything to us in detail and the difference between different items. We got to meet the chefs as well and they were super nice and accommodating . Definitely worth the price for the food and hospitality.</review>< resp>

Amazing staff and flavorful food at a reasonable price. I have only eaten here during lunch time but I am never disappointed by the food or service. Perfect hidden gem. My #1 favorite is the Falafel Salad. They are very accommodating to all dietary needs : Vegan , Gluten Free, Lactose and etc.< /text>

This place is nice to have some food if you have enough time. The food is good and tasty especially deserts are good. However the service is the slowest I have ever come across in my entire life. If they improve their service I would come again but with this slow service time it may not be a lunch option for me anymore.< /review>

<review>Update: New ownership, as of a few months ago, the food has gone downhill. Down from 5 stars to 3 at most.

Really tasty Mediterranean style food. Also, a delicious brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. Our women's group meets there once a month for lunch. They have kindly agreed to serve us family style, and continue to replenish the plates, as needed. Normally, we get a delicious chicken dish (different each time, rotates), a couple different types of salad, lentil soup, pita bread with hummus and falafels, ethnic dessert, and hot mint tea. Great service.</review>< Pictures>

I have visited this restaurant two times. The first time was excellent. Tasty , inexpensive good portion. Cannot name one issue.

The second time, a few weeks later, was awful. What do you do when the bring you some frozen food that have forgotten to warm up.<//text>

I went for the first time this past week. The selection might look small, but they replace some empty food trays with another different delicious dish! Everything was so tasty, and the guy who waited on us was so friendly and helpful. The waiter said they try and change the menu every couple of days. There was plenty of great food to eat, no complaints at all.< /Review>

I had the lamb/beef gyro. The tahini was delicious. The portion was very small for $10. But worst of all the meat was overcooked. I was literally spitting out pieces of meat because they were too hard and overcooked. Might have caught them on a bad day, but that’s not an excuse.< /Review>

I really do like this place.  I haven't tried everything on the menu so I can't speak for every dish, but the ones I've had are all really good.  Service is good; the place is never very full so you won't get ignored.  It deserves more business than it gets IMO.< /text>

I believe it was very good food however we did not like it as it was very bland. We generally go for Afghan and Persian cuisines and hence thought of trying Jerusalem grill. I would say if you guys like spicy and food with lot of spice then just tell the staff before ordering so that they can suggest you what to order and that would not lead disappointment or surprise.
5 star for service and Very good staff.< /Text>

It is perfectly priced especially for the quality of the food you get. Lets put it this way, you'll be full but you'd feel guilty leaving a crumb on your plate. IT'S THAT GOOD!!
Trust me, I've tried a lot on their menu and I've NEVER been disappointed. The place has an amazing ambiance. The waiters and friendly and the service is great. It's just an all around fantastic restaurant and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes their lunch/dinner to be perfect and satisfying.< /review>

I visited this restaurant after the evening rush but the service was very slow. It was a very difficult and long process for the order-taker to enter the food order into the computer. The food took a long time to cook. Eventually food was delivered to my table. I had ordered baklava which did not come. I had to remind them that baklava was ordered. I felt that the Greek salad did not have enough feta cheese nor did it have enough olives to justify its price.< /review>

From the moment I walked in the door, the service was great, and the wait staff was cheerful and attentive. The grilled chicken breast I ordered was tender and flavorful while the grilled vegetables were fresh tasting. As for the Jerusalem style, the dishes were better than many I have encountered in Israel itself. I would reccomend this place highly.<//Review><GmapID>0x808e3527d3f00933:0xa77e09364a19edf0</GmapID></record>

<Text>Nice food, service varies. My South Bay Folks homies do an open mic there on thursday evenings. I don't know what the atmosphere is there during the rest of the week. They have a fairly large parking lot that they share with a mexican food place and a couple of smaller store-fronts.</Text>< Name>

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had the fried eggplant and schwurma sandwich. They tasted great. The owner also provided complimentary pickles and warm, fluffy pita bread. The food took a while to come out but I prefer slow food to fast food anyway.< /review>< Pics>

Super Elite Mediterranean grill. Start off with the hummus and try the lamb kebab or shawrmama plate for lunch. Great for small children. Service is very friendly and made great recommendations for lunch. First choice for Mediterranean / levant food in the South bay</text>

<review>Pretty good - Got the shawarma wrap on a pita wrap.  Comes with fries or a tomato-cucumber salad.  Everything was balanced just right.

The food is not very Israeli, but more a mismash of cuisine from the area like Lebanon, Jordan and Israel.

They were serving a good looking lunch buffet as well at the time.<//review>< userid>

For only $13.99, you get quite a few items that are really sure to whet your appetite. The chicken shawarma was amazing, nicely spiced to perfection and went well with the jasmine rice and bread. Their were quite a few veggie dishes to choose from to get your healthy dose of greens. The salad bar was plentiful and also included dolmas. The chicken drumsticks were quite a delight as well and the coconut-based dessert provided a nice finish to the meal. Excellent buffet option for the price and the service was super friendly. Give Jerusalem Grill a try!</Review><gmapID>0x808e3527d3f00933:0xa77e09364a19edf0<//gmapID><Time>1502571459839</Time><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

Great Turkish coffee, and the pita bread was excellent. They have a mysterious herby dressing on their salad that is delicious.< /Text>

Some of the things i dont like as of late - the bread has been downgraded to low cost pita, and the service could be improved.

We love this place. My family goes out of it's way to eat hear when we are in San Jose. Their mint lemonade is not too sweet. Kufta kabab is juicy and tender. The chicken kabak is also very moist and delicious. The shwarma's are well seasoned but slightly dryer than the chicken and kufta kabab. The Jerusalem salad is exceptional, juicy and bright. Overall, I really enjoyed this place</Review>

Hidden Mediterranean gem. Try the falafel plate and the salmon. Hummus is ok, I'm more of a babaganush fan and that is amazing. Not a lot of good falafel places in the bay area and this one is definitely worth the visit. Usually very low key, no lines and quick service. Take out available as well.<//text>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>Downgrading from 4 to 2 stars.

First the pros; the chicken shawarma is nicely seasoned and one of the better ones in the bay area. Their hummus is also pretty good.

The cons overshadow the pros though and I have no interest in wasting time here anymore.

Service is extremely slow regardless of when you come in. I've been the first customer through the door on weekdays and have had to wait 30 mins + to get my meal because they seem to prioritize any phone orders/catering and they simply don't have the manpower to deal with that. They'll have the same cashier running back and forth between prepping bags for to go orders and taking your order (while you're waiting in front of the cash register) in a very disorganized fashion. Happened about 3 times before I decided it's not worth coming here on weekdays because it really eats up your lunch hour.

On weekends they have a "brunch" buffet. In the past they've always allowed customers to choose between the buffet or ordering off the menu. The menu items are of slightly better quality usually; the chicken in the buffet is usually dry and the other meat option varies - can be fish or beef etc, and if you don't eat beef then you'd want to order off the regular menu. This last weekend we arrived at 11:55 am for lunch. This was 25 mins past their opening time of 11:30. First they told us we couldn't order off the regular menu. No idea if this is a new policy or they just decided on the spot to not accommodate us. The only option was to order the buffet, but their buffet wasn't ready (aside from the hummus and salad station).
So 25 mins after opening they're still not ready for buffet service, yet they'll give no option besides the buffet to customers? That's just laughably bad service.

They don't seem to care about their business, so why should I bother coming here again.< /Review>< pictures>

this review is long over due; hani was excellent with a 2017 summer family reunion we had at jerusalem grill; relatives from australia,  germany, atlanta, colorado and various bay area cities really enjoyed the fabulous dishes cooked and served per individual choices/orders; hani even accommodated 3 special pre-orders that was not usually on their menu; all restaurant staff were awesome !! our group was not rushed.. our family really had true meal fellowship !!! they even accommodated the kids in our group with their own kids' table within  "i see you/watching you" distance from their parents in our long adults' table. the hummus, veggie dishes , various meat options were all raved about by everyone in our group. jerusalem grill food is consistently tasty and excellent; hope others get to check out their week-end lunch buffet. deserve more than 5 stars for the super-excellent service ; Kudos! Excellent job!!< /Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>I went there before one week to try their Mediterranean food. I'm an Arab person so it's easy to know the good from the bad Mediterranean food. Overall I liked the place. Clean area and the service is great. The owner is such a friendly and awesome man. Loved their chicken shawarma (just like the one I used to eat back home). I didn't like their tabula salad, the bulgur was too much. The Kanufa is a must try, fresh and yummy (just like the Turkish way). Will go there again.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
A wonderful Israeli style restaurant.  The new ownership are great but the restaurant is no longer strictly kosher.  If you don't require it, I would highly recommend.  I did speak with one of the owners who told me that they still to glatt kosher catering.

I highly recommend the Sabich, which is hard to find in the US.  It is a pita sandwich like falafel but it is filled with eggplant and hard boiled egg.  Also get the labne with zatar (thick yogurt with wild thyme and sesame seeds).  you won't regret it.< /Review>

< Review>
I thought this place was going to be terrible at first, but I was hungry so i went for it.  Let me tell you, it was one of the most exquisite culinary experiences I've ever had, and I don't give away 5 stars easily.  The waiters were extremely amiable and knowledgable of the menu, and helped me pick out the "Schnitzel" with a side of falafel.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, seasoned phenomenally.  Afterwards, I indulged in some "kunafa" and coffee, while I chatted to the owner, Hani, about Mediterranean food.  Definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it.< /Review>

Sorry, but after being to lots of middle eastern restaurants in Michigan, I really think that this one is disappointing, price wise, portion wise, wait time, food was cold, i just don't know how to end it with a good review.< /Text>

Honestly, it's just kinda dirty and smelly everywhere on the boardwalk. The beach isn't bad, looks better when the view is clear, but the boardwalk needs work. Those living in tents need to be made to abide by certain rules like...not playing with your pubes in the open.
Yeah, I saw a woman do that on a bright sunny day.<//review>

You can park you car for long time. They have reasonable prices.
You may park your car over there.

Cheapest place to park and right on the beach. But the promenade smells like piss and there are a lot of homeless people there. I guess if you're going to be homeless the beach is where you'd want to be. However there are public restrooms so why do they have to pee on the trash cans?</Text>

What can you say about Venice Beach, but all around fun. But I do feel they need a higher presence of law enforcement officers. Sometimes feels kind of sketchy.<//review>

Not too bad a place to park...2 blocks from beach and pretty easy to maneuver around.  There are cheaper ($10) and closer places but all in all this worked just fine.< /review>

<review>Waves were big the day we went so beach access was limited. Has metered parking right next to the park. EZ access off HWY 1. A real treat!<//review><rating>5</rating>< user_name>

Easy access to  Venice beach and strand. Price went down as day went on.  Bathrooms were cleaned up from time to time a big improvement from last visit.< /review>

<Review>$6 to park all day is worth it. Came on a Thursday so wasn't hard to find a spot. Nice to be close to the beach and boardwalk so we didn't have to lug things around between laying on the beach and grabbing ice cream and art from vendors.</Review>< resp>

Public parking $20/day. nice to walk on the cliff.  you can rent bicycles for 1 or 2 people, etc.  Here you can find Venice muscle beach gym.  you can do various sports.<//Review>

I think the lot attendant had Autism and it was cool. I like places that give people chances. The parking lot was crowded and full of disrespectful people who would look away as they tried to shove past. Common courtesy is a unicorn.< /text>

Not clean, be careful of glass I noticed few broken bottles of beers all over the beach. Bathrooms super dirty looks never maintained since 1996. Not water in bathroom sinks.< /review>

<Text>The best thing I can say about this is,  they found a place for me to park and my car didn't get stolen or vandalized.  Otherwise,  the conditions of the area and the people who were nearby didn't make me feel safe.<//Text><name>Ken Haynie< /name>< Time>

You pay for ease of access and ease of access is what you get. Parking rates are BS as it seems they charge what they want when they want.<//Text>

Fantastic business, fast and efficient. New battery and adjustment for the MK and adjustment for the Iced out Bulova. They are the best in town, with a large selection of jewelry for sale.. Then i came back to have a diamond replace to my old worn out engagement rings and they did a absolutely fantastic job of bringing these rings back to life that it brought tears to my eyes. My wedding bands look better than when I first bought them. Thankyou Fast Fix. You are the best in Irvine for sure.!<//review>

Can’t say enough good things. I’ve dealt with a lot of jewelry businesses and manufacturers and know just how grimy the “behind the scenes” can be. Fast Fix is unlike the rest - amazing quality, super quick turn around, good pricing, and professional. They are a breath of fresh air in this industry!</review>

Hands down the best source for watch repair and watch batteries.

Saeed and his wife are super friendly. I was greeted with a warm smile and you can tell they know how to treat their customers.

I had dropped an AP and was devastated when it stopped working. A gear was dislodged inside. An Audemars repair would have run several hundred dollars or more if I sent it back to my jeweler. Saeed had it fixed in one day for a very fair price.

I brought a Daytona in for polishing and it looks better than new.

They also repaired 4 other watches that needed batteries in under 15 minutes.

Don't look any further- they are the best around!</Review>

I needed to get an engagement ring and like most guys I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I had absolutely zero reference on how much a ring would cost, the different types of diamonds and bands, or just overall the quality of the ring. As a result I was super nervous going into Fast Fix but they made the entire process way more enjoyable than I thought. They were super helpful with every detail, extremely patient with my decisions and are just awesome people in general. The ring turned out amazing and my now wife absolutely loves it. I would 100% recommended them to anybody looking to get a ring or anything jewelry related.</Text>

My husband and I came in on a Friday morning to get our rings resized. The associate who helped us was very friendly and quick with answering any questions we had. We got an estimate on cost, dropped off our rings, and left with the expectation that the job would be done in about 2 hours. To my surprise, I got a text notification about 30 minutes later indicating that our rings were ready to be picked up. The resizing was done well and flawlessly. Ring even got a nice polish and clean.

I would absolutely recommend this location to anyone for similar service needs.< /Review>

Saeed is such nice guy and friendly. He's the owner of the shop and he takes care of your valuable items himself. He's talented and handy when it comes to fixing things you might think can not be fixed. I would say just give a try before you give up on your things. One more thing, he's fast!</text>

{'time': 1577047524128, 'text': 'Hi CJ,\nThank you for the review of our store. I would like to point out that your watch is a screw holding back and requires only a small screwdriver to open it. There are no other tools needed to open the watch back. The scratches you outline in the picture are not located directly where the screws are on the watch.'}</Resp>
< review>
Battery replacement was reasonable with water resistance pressure testing.  Unfortunately they’re not watch jewelers and I received my watch back with a few more scratches than I gave it to them.  It’s not a watch I normally wear so it was pretty clean of blemishes going in.

They were not from me because you can’t get nicks or gouges like that while wearing it.  Especially the edges of the caseback where it’s away from impacts.  Plus when. I’m not wearing it it goes back in a watch roll immediately and never lying on its bare caseback.   Speaking of caseback the mountain decoration was previously right side up for the wearer and when I received it back it was upside down.

I was hoping this being close to my house would be ideal but I would not go back for the scratches and some some details they missed.

This was my guinea pig test of their service with a reasonably priced Hamilton quartz watch.  I think for small services I’ll need to go to Jostmar’s at South Coast Plaza again.< /review>

Update: I talked to the owners about designing an engagement ring for me. They worked within my budget to make an absolutely beautiful ring that was even better than I pictured in in my head. I'm glad I asked them to do this for me instead of going somewhere and just picking whatever was under the glass. Great experience. Oh, also she said yes.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Took my boyfriends watch here to repair the broken glass. $75 fix, and it looked great after! Very helpful staff. That is until later that day when I presented it to him and he noticed there was a shard of residual broken glass still under the new glass. He took it back, they apologized and said they’d fix it free of charge. When he picked it up after this second visit, the piece pointed out was removed. But there was another! Quite sloppy work. We should not have to make three trips because of lack of attention to detail. I do not recommend this place unless you’re looking for cute jewelry to buy. They offer nice rings and bracelets!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Valerie Gomez< /username>< Date>

We are sorry that you were not happy with our service.\nWhen we originally accepted the repair we were asked to replace the broken glass of your watch which we did. When a watch glass breaks sometimes small pieces get into the working mechanism of the watch thru different openings on the dial and they can be hidden from the view and can be surfaced over time by moving.\nYour watch had this case of broken pieces inside the movement which showed up when you took it home.\nAlthough opening the movement and clean all different layers of it is a separate job by itself we did it for free for you.\nWe considered not charging any extra for the additional service would be an act of kindness but we were obviously wrong.\nPlease stop by and try us one more time I am confident that we can win your trust.'}</Resp>< rating>

I had such a great experience! I went in for a jewelry repair (broken ring guard band) and the jeweler fixed it exactly how I hoped he would! The jeweler came over and spoke with me to make sure he got it just right. I felt the price was very fair for the work that was done and they had it ready for pick up just a few hours later!! He polished up my rings and made them sparkle! I believe it was the owners that I had the other interactions with and they were so nice! If I have any further jewelry needs they will be my first go to!< /Text>

I love this place. I am here probably at least 4 times a month. It's not hard to find tons of really nice clothes in all sizes and some with tags on still. They have a 25 50 and 75 percent off deal daily and don't forget to go check out the collectables section in the far back left corner of the store. I have come across some treasures in there. The parking can be a little stressing at times but definitely my go to thrift store< /Text>

Prepare for delays . Not easily assessable more than likely you will make a I-mate turn. Long lines like 7 people only one register open, they finally did open another they cited, "social distancing. ".  After long wait I was not allowed to purchase a phone well let.  "Sorry we can't sell an open item." Thanks for nothing.  Final conclusion the place was packed so obviously, it's popular .. It's s thrift store.< /text>

This is hands down the best thrift store in Southern California. You can drive around and see for yourself, but I know that this is true. But really,
-sometimes- I wish they wouldn't put price stickers on some items. I know they must know that when they do this. Customers take so much time to get them off that they might as well have dedicated more time to work and bought the same item new. Like, really, look at the actual item you are putting that sticker on.. Will it actually come off without a struggle? can you put it in a bag and then put the price tag on that?.. ok, that was just some constructive criticism.. all and all amazing place to shop :D</text>

<review>I have been shopping at this store since the early 70s, as a child with my mom, I  now take my adult kids and grandchildren there as well, I always find the stuff I need for me and my home, and will continue to shop there in the future,  always reasonable prices for all your needs.< /review>< Pictures>

This place has some of the best items I’ve seen, but at a higher price than I expected.  But for good quality items... can’t complain! It’s clean in there and staff are nice! Also if you are looking for some good stripper heals or club heals this it the place to go... they also have church shoes also!! Men’s shoes in great condition name brand for a good price!< /Review>

<review>I honestly wasn’t impressed with this place. The parking is limited and not in the best area. I was I initially excited because it is 2 floors, but I felt the prices were high. I was interested in two pairs of activewear pants for my 12 year old only to find them both priced at $14.99. Not on sale. For underarmour pants that you can buy at tj maxx new at about $12 ? No, thanks. Not a win for me.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<text>The employees are usually not cool especially before they are closing! I came in 5 minutes before they closed but they wouldn’t let me get something that would’ve taken literally 1 minute to grab. Not cool.
I don’t think that is even legal because they were still legally open, again just seriously not cool at all.
I don’t appreciate driving to a place that says that they are open, but then when you get there during their open business hours they say that you can’t give them money even though they are still open. Really really just not cool.
I don’t understand how a business that is open for business doesn’t want more money while they are still open, I mean it’s definitely not cool right?<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had a good experience. The store was very well stocked and organized. Compared to other thrift stores, it was clean as well. Depending on what day you shop, the prices were reasonable. If you go on a day when they offer %50- %75 off, I would recommend.< /Review><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<review>This place is a treasure trove of great finds. Like any thrift store it is hit and miss on quality, but I always leave with something good. It is not handicap friendly, as it is two levels, and only has stairs. There walkways are also definitely not handicap accessible.The staff is not very friendly, or helpful, so do not expect any kind of service. I go here all the time and always wait in line forever even though there are three open registers at least, and staff all over the store. But if you dont need accommodations and don't care about 100% self service, then check it out.<//review></record></dataset><record>

In the straight up ghetto and can get very crowded, but I have loved this place for many years. Recently the employees on the floor have gotten to be the rudest I've ever come across. The cashiers don't seem to have the same attitude as I haven't had any negative experiences there. The prices can be pretty good most of the time but they'll raise the prices on better known brands. I was furious after my last visit. They're stapling the price tag over the tag with the brand and size. We need to know the size! And if you're asking $20 for a pair of donated jeans I want to see if they're at least a quality brand!</review>

Staff singled out my boyfriend though and followed him around ! We didn't care for that too much ! Also I carry a small oxygen machine around everywhere ..... I keep the machine in a backpack !! Mind you this is also my "purse", I was told I couldn't have this with me and had to leave it in front !!! My oxygen !!!!! And my purse !!!! Yet no others singled out !!! Yes I look sickly being in lung failure but really people !!!!! Then demanded I tell them what medical issues I have !!! This woman laughed at me !!!!! Great customer service skills !!!!</Review>

<Time>1501541017014</Time><review>Friendly ,courteous, well kept. You can find what you're looking for if they have it, check back every few days because the stock is turned over regularly. Hard to beat the price especially with the service given.  I shop two or three times a week and see many of the same repeat customers. I think I shop to visit old friends and the girl on the register 😉.<//review><GmapID>0x80c3531509d4804f:0xeeac8fa4dabe4c76<//GmapID><response>None</response><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Marion Meux< /user_name><UserId.>109207043116235540245<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

This is my favorite thrift store. Everything is well organized. Workers are busy, busy, busy. Haven't been here for awhile. Today I noticed some items are more pricey than before. Although, I did purchase great items. Highly recommend!<//Text>

<UserId.>107186190549660544181<//UserId.><Text>Today I was asked to get up from a chair upstairs by the security guard I ask him if they change the policy he replied "That's the policy I got" I want to make it clear he offer me a chair maybe from downstairs since I was just resting, since I had been resting for 10 minutes already I told him I didn't need one anymore and yes I got a disability I'm not just a lazy guy who likes to sit everywhere:-) Mark and the other guys know that.. The staff its great.

I have been a customer for 10 years of Eco Thrifty Store and this is the first time I have been asked to get up from a chair.

In the past 8 years Elders/disable had use those chairs to rest for 10 or 15 minutes and then continue their shopping personally know at least 45 disabled customers who need to take intermittent rests due to their chronic or medical needs. As a member of this community, it's important to know the places who are accessible and friendly to any person with a disability.

to all those who need to sit for a few minutes for now on let know the security guard to provide you with a chair as soon as you enter the door if you know, you may need to take a rest for a few minutes. This has been a great place Mark is a great "guy" Maria and other cashiers are fabulous.

Today I will rate Eco one star due to this incident it's always nice to see all business provided the disable accessibility and accommodation in the city of San Bernardino.<//Text>< resp>

I enjoy being a customer who wants to be buying everything on hand I shop Eco Thrift everyday one hour before they close and I find great deals and the staff is great the only thing is that they need to announce is to keep your children with you at all times other than that and they should go back to closing at 8pm thank you for your time.Antonia Alvarez 92410<//Review>

Pros: Nice thrift store, lots of stuff with decent prices. Good sales, lots of clothes new w/ tags and designer items, seems they restock around every Tuesday. Cons: Most of the staff is nice but they kind of hover while you're shopping, once my sister and i were in line about 1/2 ft from where the sign was posted and the cashier took another customer instead 😒 Kinda irritating but not enough to make me miss out on the good deals.< /Review>

Please if you or someone u know don't take a person with wheelchair it's not handicap accessible. Restroom is not appropriate for a a wheelchair won't go in. I had a hard time trying to put my Mom's wheelchair in restroom but it didn't go through.  We had to leave the place. And not to mention the front door   it won't stay open when going in or out of store.</Text>

Been an ongoing customer for over 40 years at this location.
Wish they would bring back the very popular " xl " only section.
Long time staff are always very efficient and friendly.
Mark downs every week.
Quality of offerings very high.<//Text>

They always have great deals. Though you do need to be wary of their red tagged items; they can be a little pricey. The isles are a little cramped but if you take your time you will always find something great.<//Review>

Located in the rough area of San Bernardino. Expensive for a thrift store. Toddler Levis $19.95, fake converse $24.95. Employees are not friendly.<//Review>

A lovely bit of serenity with many plants and flowers to enjoy and purchase. Located near many wineries on an easy, paved road to get there. Bring a picnic lunch to share with your family in the safe of beautiful Oak trees while watching the ducks on the pond. They also have treats like ice cream and soda to purchase. Fun for the whole family.  In a word: Lovely.< /review>

Lots of birds, tons of flowers, venerable oaks, turtles, bullfrogs, picnic area, restrooms, gift shop. A perfect outing from EDHills; 33 minute drive down Latrobe Rd. through Plymouth. I recommend.< /Review>

OMG! This place is a MUST see!  The website does NOT do it justice. This Flower Farm is beautiful. The gift shop is very cute and the customer service is superb. Not only are the demonstration garden's beautiful the daylilies garden is nothing I have ever seen before..The picnic area is very quaint and peaceful and you sit along the pond.  You can see the Koi swim by, there are turtles and bull frogs in the pond as well..We did see a snake in the road by the gate, it was a harmless kings snake. We didn't bother it, it didn't bother us.  If you're looking for a nice day trip, it's definitely worth the drive. Prices are great! Nice selection of fruits, veggies, succulents and if course Lily's. Over 1200 varieties. Upon purchase they give you paperwork on how to keep your Lily's alive. I'm not exactly a green thumb.<//review>

<text>This place is like none other. The nursery and plants are shown to perfection on a grand scale. Their wines are great drinks and one should linger for an unforgettable, joyful experience. Make room for a case or two of the wine and a passel of perennials and other select plants!</text>< Pics>

This review is for the pumpkin patch only.  This is a wonderful place to bring the family and pick out a pumpkin or two for the Halloween season.  They have a nice picnic area, a fun corn maze, plus a great selection of pumpkins.  The best thing about this place?  It does not have the insane crowds of Apple Hill during the fall season.  This was our 4th year coming here and we plan to continue to come here.<//review>

<text>A beautiful place to spend an afternoon. The flower gardens are amazing and make for a lovely stroll. There are picnic areas, gift shop, restrooms, and nursery. In October they have a fun pumpkin patch with a free corn maze. Pumpkins come in quite the variety of shapes, sizes, and types (traditional, Cinderella style, gourds, you name it, they have it). Very reasonable pricing on large pumpkins. We got quite the selection. Just love this place and its offerings.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

On it's own, the Flower Farm is a great place to take a walk through their gardens, shop at the garden shop, or purchase plants at the nursery.  Staff are always knowledgeable about the products and plants sold.  The Flower Farm specializes in daylilies of which they literally have thousands of varieties.  The Flower Farm also hosts a number of great events throughout the year including an Easter egg hunt and a corn maze with a pumpkin patch in October.<//text>

<review>Absolutely beautiful grounds, and it's so wonderful being able to walk around them freely. They're thoughtfully laid out, with benches under the trees for shade, a very cute picnic area, and clean restrooms. Wonderful stop if you're in the area.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I being my family here in all seasons. Lillies are their specialty.  In the spring it is a riot of color from all the lillies they have planted in the fields surrounding the property. The planted grounds are ideal to see what they are selling and how well they would do in your yard. The planted grounds are extensive, so you can take a long walk. In summer they feature all California varietals as well as perennials and annuals. The store changes with plant products for spring and summer and they have holiday items as well. This is just a great place for everyone.< /Review>

<Text>Came in to get a payday advance loan today.  First time in this location and I was very satisfied with their quick and easy sign up process. Friendly staff, No need for a bank check here,  just supply them with your bank information and you're set! Other businesses take not.  All in all an overall good experience<//Text><Date>1620416392986<//Date>< resp>

< Review>
The staff at the Manhattan Beach WeWork office are extremely friendly and inviting especially Bri. Bri was the first to great me with enthusiasm and was very accommodating and professional while providing a tour of the office space. The COVID protocols that were executed by the staff created a safe environment and showed me their level of dedication in providing a great work environment. I look forward to spending more time in the coworking space and being able to benefit from what the space has to offer when more restrictions are lifted.< /Review>

The staff is great! They help answer any questions someone may have and are 100% friendly.  The staff helps create a comfortable, fun experience when coming in for work.  The rooms are great and they host awesome events! I would recommend this location to anyone looking to rent out an office space!<//Text>

<review>I have been working here since it opened in January of 2017 and think it is the best decision I have made in terms of office space. The space is cool and inviting, the staff is friendly, smart and quick to help. They also help troubleshoot in a timely manner. Plus the tenants are cool.Wework Manhattan Towers ROCKS!</review>< Response>

Very attractive location, with multiple floors.  Each floor has a slightly different feel, but they all have private and communal space.  Art books and plants are everywhere, and there is a gym on site with parking as well.< /review>

There are 2 floors, a gym and parking attached to this WeWork space. The common area is pretty amazing. And after work there are 2 types of beer on tap ready for the happy hour to begin!< /Review>

First impression was a 3.5 stars. Came here for an appt. thought it was regular business building, for a dental office business but turns out it's this. The NY guy at desk "validated" my ticket. Got in my car and at the gate the reader said invalid. Tried a few times.. tried the other second gate and then it was asking to pay.. seriously? I've only been there 35 min. Is this a shady business set up or your reader malfunction and you - yes You the prop mgmt. and/ or landlord who charged your business tenants rents- do need to get it fixed or get new person because the help button gets a lazy operator who's just playing games kept hanging up on me dozen times. Made the business look bad that lied to that I'd be comp when I parked inside.. if had known I'd parked outside Parkview and walked and not bother. Never coming back. Ok-nice place but overall left a bad taste /impression. Biggest pet peeve being tricked/ lied to. I don't mind paying I've paid $50 parking at a charity auction event,
but when the guy lied to me and didn't validate when you handed back to me ticket and said it is--I feel better when I stand my ground and not giving you a penny. Lost a customer.</review>

Have a 3 person office at MB wework. While the actual private office is kind of small, the overall facility is awesome. Tons of common areas to work, access to phonebooth style desks for private calls, beer taps on every floor, and good coffee. Also, building has a high quality gym on the first floor and is only $20/month for wework members.< /Review>

<Text>Looked at all the reviews on Mexican Food in Bishop. Looked great and it was. Best mex food we have had in a long time. Service was impeccable. Opens at 5:00 and fills up fast.</Text>< Pics>

We had so much fun here drinking a pitcher of margaritas on the patio. The service was slow but it was busy after covid with socially distanced tables. The food was good. We will definitely return.< /text>

One of my favorite spots when I return home! The quality of the food is always consistent and service is always friendly! Oh, and try the prickly pear margarita! This pic is the sizzling chicken fajita!</Text>

This place has a full parking lot every time we drive by so we decided to stop and check it out.
OMG!  Our food was so good and our waitress, Maria, was very attentive.
We had the ground beef taco pizza and the chili relleno/chicken enchilada combo.
My husband NEVER cleans his plate at a Mexican restaurant,  today he did.  We will be back!</text>

Been coming here for a few years and they never disappoint. Food is great, salsa is good, service does an outstanding job and its very clean. We stop here at least twice a year when in the area.<//text>

They had strings of lights and heaters to keep us warm when it ot colder and we even got the fire pit table that garnered a lot of "oohs" and "ahhs" from our girls lol.

Absolutely delicious food and super friendly employees...these dark days aren't holding these guys back! The shredded beef  Chimichanga was just as good as the phenomenal souza enchiladas.... Raised the bar the Mexican food for sure!!

<Review>I’m from Bay Area and get over here occasionally.  Astorgas (and Great Basin Bakery) are why I prefer Bishop to Lone Pine. Both are better than their better advertised competitors in Bishop. I’m partial to the Chili Verde and Cadillac Margarita. I’m not sure the locals know how good a thing they have.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Name>Meagan Dunlap McKinley< /Name><Time>1594236755664</Time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Only a party of 2, we waited outside, due to social distancing, for 25 minutes in 102 degree weather (which wasn't a big deal) we were completely ignored from the moment we walked up.  Not even acknowledged, the worst customer service I have ever received. I don't usually leave reviews but this one was a must! Awful service!!  Unfortunate, as we love to support local and small businesses but not this establishment.

Note : (I can't seem to directly respond to the below, so I am attaching to review)
Thank you for the response Manuel, I completely understand all of the issues and challenges you are facing daily if not hourly during these uncertain times.  Patience is a must, not only for owners but patrons.  As we waited for over 20 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement was super disappointing. Upon leaving, we watched another couple walk up and leave after being treated the same, they just didn't tolerate it or wait around as long.
Anyhow, sounds like you have your food dialed in (great reviews are why we stopped to dine) .... good luck on ironing out the customer service!

All the best!
Meagan<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1594090715590, 'text': 'Hello Meagan my name is Manuel Astorga and I’m the G.M for Astorgas, I want to first and foremost apologize for the awful customer service you received here at my restaurant, I hold a very high standard when it comes to customer service, I will be following up with my crew and find out what happened, I assure you this will be taken care of. Unfortunately we are required to have our customers wait outside for dine in and it being very hot I understand how uncomfortable that must have been, we do try our best to get everyone in and seated but with the limited crew that we’re required to have it makes it pretty difficult, they have the phone orders that call in and also the extra cleaning that is required after every customer that leaves, it makes it very difficult to accommodate to everyone but we do appreciate the patience. We are working on trying to make it quicker, but either way I do agree that we shouldn’t have ignored you and for that I deeply apologize for. I hope you can give us a second chance and try us again so we can show you that we do not operate this way and that our customers always come first. Thank you very much for letting me know so I can take the time to fix any issues that we have.'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80be1615c59c969f:0xaadcd00e76dbcac4</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wow...those Margaritas are sinful!  Salsa tasty, on the nippy side, and so nice with the  thin warm chips.  Menu offers a nice variety and portions reasonable.<//text>

Ordered online got to the Astorga’s and picked up two burritos selected chips and salsa, guacamole and sour cream only got the burritos went back to get the chips and salsa and they gave me one bag of chips no salsa and I said was supposed to get two chips but they said I ordered only one. So confused I left then found out not only did I pay for two of everything I was still short my salsa I had paid 39.92, with tax it was 43 something anyway it’s common there and shouldn’t be happening I’m not the only one who has gotten ripped off my parents had the same thing happen to them but they naturally assumed it was their mistake. The burrito cost 10.99 with nothing added, condiments are 2.99 each, altogether 19.96 add another set it’s 39.92.<//review>

I ordered a chili relleno burrito..what I got was a plain tough chili inside a flour tortilla. The chili had no egg, no cheese inside. Just a chili, beans, rice and some cheese inside a flour tortilla. A total disappointment.....< /text>

<review>Amazing great Mexican food!  Had the chimachanda and it was cooked perfectly with shredded beef, the sauce was outstanding, it also had lettuce, sour cream and fresh guacamole.  The hot sauce was not hot enough for my taste so I also ordered diced fresh jalapenos to kick it up a notch.  I would totally recommend this place to everyone I know.  Service inside was very attentive and timely.  Just go try!</review><GmapID>0x80be1615c59c969f:0xaadcd00e76dbcac4<//GmapID><rate>5</rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Michelle Lamm - Faries</user_name>< userid>

Ordered the #14 Carnitas plate, and it was really excellent, rice and beans were also.  We have a lot of great Mexcian food where we live, this Carnitas plate was as good as it gets.  I'll be back next time we are in this area.</Review>< date>

Great Tortilla Soup!!!!!
Our Server was very attentive to our desires and needs!
CalTrans was installing a Traffic Signal at Astorga’s intersection,
so their Patio Wall/Fence demo’d out for the Street work...
But I am sure that once the wall is up DRINKS ON THE PATIO WILL BE GREAT!!!< /Text>

When we arrived in the nearly empty restaurant, we were told to wait for the waitress to wipe down a dirty table. I’m pretty sure the people working there didn’t smile one time, and appeared to hate being there. The food tasted good, but also nothing special. Lunch for 3 people should not cost $50 though. They charged us $2 to add sauce to a burrito, $3 for a side of sour cream, and $3.25 for a fountain drink. I have never experienced so much overcharging at any restaurant in my life. Will not be back.</Text>

This is one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in a long time. My husband and I live in our 5th wheel trailer and travel full time. One of our favorite ethnic foods to eat is Mexican so we really appreciate flavorful, authentic food. Try the carnitas!</review>

10-18-17.  $8 for an ala cart tamale.  $8 for an ala cart chili relliano.  $5 for an ala cart taco. Absolutely highway robbery.  My fault for not asking price before I ordered, but have never seen prices like these. got blind sided big time. Manager basically told me too bad.  Been going there for years. Never again. Shame there in no "0" star.< /Text>

{'time': 1508388626843, 'text': 'Thank you for your review good or bad we take them all very seriously and we use the reviews to help make our establishment better, but as I was reading your review I’m realizing that this doesn’t help me in any way in improving our service or quality, as it’s just complaining about our prices but it doesn’t mention nothing in how your experience was, so  I’m going to assume that everything else was good as in service and in quality. We take great pride in providing great service and quality food, I did see that you did finish your meal so I’m very happy that you enjoyed your Tamale, Taco, and Chili Relleno. If prices defines your experiences in restaurants and not service or quality then I apologize for not providing prices that meet your expectations and if you decide not to come back because of prices instead of your experience then I would recommend to go somewhere else and I hope they are able to give you the prices that you are looking for, but I also hope that you decide to start looking at the service and quality that they give also because in my experience to run a successful business you need those two big factors. I personally prefer service and quality over prices but that’s just me. I do hope that you decide to come back and give us another shot but unfortunately I’m not going to be changing our prices because the prices we pay have been going up tremendously as well and were just trying to keep afloat.\nThank you for taking the time to place a review with us. Have a wonderful day.'}<//response>

It was very dissapointing for a $20.00 dish. The waitress did'nt even ask us if the food was ok since we hardly touched it. Bad example of Mexican food.<//Review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) If the food is very tasty and the attention is also the only thing that I did not like that I asked for a golden taco of meat and said that it came with cream and we asked the waitress and I did not charge it 2.99 a small glass

(Original)
Si esta muy rica la comida y la atencion tambien lo unico que no me gusto que pedi un taco dorado de carne y decia que venia con crema y le pedimos ala mesera y no la cobro 2.99 un vasito pequeñito<//text>

<text>They saved Mango's life.
Mango was diagnosed with lymphoma at another clinic and quickly went downhill after his Elspar injection.  He could barely stand.  At 14 we thought his little body couldn't handle any more and we feared the worst when we brought him here.
The staff was calming and professional and most important they kept us constantly informed so we were never left wondering what was going on.
After his first night here we came to visit in the outside tent. Honestly I thought it would be our last visit. He was so weak. But the staff was optimistic so that gave us hope.
Two emotionally grueling days later we picked him up and brought him home.. and he's walking! The turnaround is incredible.
We know our time with him is short with his lymphoma but we feel he's on a better path thanks to the guidance we're getting.
This has been a difficult journey but I'm glad for the quality help, advice and expertise. I'm sure Mango would be thankful too.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had to euthanize my cat today, and I dealt with Sarah.  Sarah was wonderful and explained everything.  The Dr. Came in and asked questions to make sure it was the right decision.   She was also wonderful and truly cared, she explained everything and gave us plenty of time with our cat.  They made a horrible decision feel less painful.     It feels odd to explain how great they were during this time.< /Review><user>110360636416809651351</user>< username>

We brought in our Golden Retriever on Friday night and had excellent service from the front desk to the doctors.  We were able to visit Rooney and take her outside on walks but each day but she got worse. On Monday Dr. Harb-Hauser took over and tried to do everything she could but Rooney's body was shutting down so we had to put her to sleep on Tuesday.
We are grateful to everyone that helped take care of Rooney as she was loved by our family and an amazing dog.<//text>

<Text>This place is great. Helpful and knowledgeable staff and everyone takes the time to listen and explain. Kind demeanor and thorough explanation of diagnosis and post visit care. Didn’t hit me with a huge bill when I had to bring my dog into ER after my regular vet was full. Intake was quick, very little wait time and the vet spent about 10 minutes on the phone with me afterwards answering all of my question. Absolutely recommend!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< resp>

<text>I heard of this clinic through the Next Door app. This was my first time at any emergency pet hospital. I tried to get an appointment with my vet but they did not have anything until the next day. I was told when I called initially of the wait time (at least 2 hours) and when I arrived it changed to 4-5 hours. I was worried that I would have to wait with Rocket in the car but I was pleasantly surprised that she would be brought in to make sure there wasn't anything life-threatening. I feel very confident about recommending this clinic to others for their pets. Thank you for your care and kindness. The person I spoke to when I arrived listened to me and made sure my cat got in to have a quick once over to make sure nothing was life-threatening. Also, the vet answered all of my questions in a kind manner and didn't give off the vibe of needing to get off the phone for the next patient even though I know they were very busy.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1614986227841, 'text': 'Thank you so much Stephanie for taking the time to share your experience with us.

I appreciate the compassion and professionalism I always receive, and knowing my babies are receiving the absolute best care. I remember bringing my childhood dog to PECSM when I was in elementary school. I'm approaching my mid-40's and have made countless visits with my pets over the years, and the level of care every single time is second to none. I have nothing but deep appreciation and gratitude for the good and hard work you do, and am so thankful to have such an incredible resource in our community. Thank you for all you do and for doing it so well!!!<//Text>

I can't thank you enough for the care you showed for Pierre and the quick response. I know things could have turned out differently, but from the minute I arrived I felt your compassion. He means the world to me and I'm so glad I got to bring him home today! You could feel the love for my dog from the entire staff that cared for him and how important he is to me and this was the first time I've ever brought him there.</review>

We had a great visit, and I'm so glad everything worked out well for our cat Ali 🐈.  We were scared for her. Our cats doctor, Dr. Boyer was very kind,  thorough and explained everything well. We appreciated the patience they had with us as we made treatment decisions for our cat. I was able to come back home and tuck my 3 year old son in for bedtime and read him a story. At one point  the phone rang during his story time,  Dr. Boyer was so kind to let me finish his bedtime routine and call her back to discuss Ali’s care. I didn’t feel rushed in that moment.  I am so grateful to her and the whole crew! :)</review>

<text>I liked the follow up email and professional care The friendly staff and the professional doctor. I felt like she knew what she was doing.
Edit/Follow up: I brought my cat there on Tuesday and they said they’d follow up with me on test results 24 to 48 hours later. I didn’t hear anything and called on Friday morning. They said, a doctor would call me back. I called again in the afternoon, they promised someone would call me back before the end of the day for sure. It’s Saturday night and I haven’t heard anything. They charged me for the results being reviewed by a specialist. I’m disappointed.<//text>< userid>

Everyone was very helpful and so nice in my interactions with them. I felt immediately confident in leaving my pet in the care of a brand new provider. The doctor taking time to talk with me personally both before and after the appointment in great detail but also speaking in layman's terms made ensure that I was fully informed and understood both the diagnosis and treatment plan.</Text>

We want to thank PESC very much for all of their help in getting our cat mended and for being completely straight with us about his condition. Their caring attitude including sharing pictures of our cat when he looked more perky were so much appreciated. We were very scared but we wanted to know absolutely everything and the doctors did just that. They laid down expectations, realistic prognosis, and kept us up to date with any changes during the 4+ days our cat was in their care. We couldn't be more appreciative or happy with PESC's service, professionalism, and care.<//text>

<Text>My cat see's Dr Sabhlok. She is amazing. I have met with other oncologists and she is the best by far. Her bedside manner, she takes the time to explain things and treats both my cat and I, like we matter. She doesnt see us as a cash cow or pay day. She and her staff really care about their patients. She also welcomes input from pet parents before moving forward with treatment.

Overall their pricing isn't bad either. The entire staff is always patient and kind.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1604959552040, 'text': "Thank you so much for your kind review and your support, Jane.

< Review>
I took my dog here when he was suddenly unable to walk. I thought he might be having a stroke or seizure. They took my dog in right away and called me quickly with the diagnosis (vestibular disease, basically vertigo for dogs). The doctor explained everything thoroughly and I was pleasantly surprised  that he did not pressure me to get more tests. In fact, we asked him to do a blood test just in case. (They were clear as he said they probably would be).The person at the front desk was patient and helpful, even though I know she had many other stressed out people she was dealing with. I was very impressed with the professionalism and communication. Also I expected the price to be much higher since it was an emergency situation. I was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty much in line with what I would pay at any vet. Lower than some even.</Review>

We have moved many times and have experienced a lot of different vets in different countries. I can honestly say that VCA has been the best vet care we have experienced and we are so happy to have found your team.

< review>
I was recommended to PESCM by my primary vet. I had to bring in my cat Gaspar for a urinary obstruction. The knowledge and expertise of the doctors is evident. The transparency they provided around his diagnosis and potential risks and re-occurrence was great. I liked that I also didn't have to track down the doctors. They provided regular updates when they said they would. Staff was always professional and courteous when I called and the cost around his treatment was explained thoroughly.

It was evident they truly care about the animals they treat. I really felt peace of mind that my cat was in great hands. I highly recommend this hospital to anyone who has a sick baby and wants expert care.</review>

<text>Thank you again for all your help. Losing Max is the hardest thing we as a family had to do. In the past we've felt that other vets gave up on him too quick, and we appreciate all your time and efforts to educate us on his conditions and give us your honest opinion in what's best for our angel Max. Thank you again for your compassion, patience, and support Pet Emergency. They were genuine and compassionate for my pet and my family the entire way through. Although it was a devastating situation, our family never felt neglected and truly felt we put our sweet baby to sleep in the best way it could've gone. Thank you so much for making our last few moments with him so special.</text></record>

We love the oncology and emergency staff at this clinic.  Dr. Sabhlok (oncologist) has seen and treated a few of our pups along the way.  I can't say enough wonderful things about her.  SHE IS AMAZING! DON'T EVER LET HER GO!
And the staff is incredibly friendly, kind and patient. That really makes all the difference in the world when you're worried about your four legged child.< /text>

The doctor was amazing and kind on the phone, we really appreciated his bedside manner and how much he cared about our dog.

A bit more transparency on timing would be great, maybe an website to show you how many people are ahead of you with estimated wait time that would be great because we didn't want to call in and ask for timing updates and interfere with emergency calls they might be receiving.</Review>

Often times I visit a vet and I feel like I am at a car dealership- where I'm being asked to spend as much as possible. I greatly appreciated the vet's honest assessment of my dog's situation and the recommended plan came from her assessment not out of motivation to fill the bank account. So thank you!<//Text>

I am so happy to have this service available in Marin County. Pet Emergency & Specialty Center has served so many people like my dog & me over their many years in business. They are very professional, kind & thoughtful of our needs. There is nothing worse than when your animals is sick or injured. These Doctors, Nurses and Aides have your back. What I liked most was the immediate care and concern for my dog's well being. They even put together a follow up plan for me, including informing my personal veterinarian and sending a complete summary of all the details of our visit. My DVM had contacted me with in moments of receiving their evaluation to let me know he was ready to continue with the care recommended. Thank you for being so caring.< /review>

Been here numerous times for both emergencies and Internal Medicine visits and am always happy with the level of care my animals receive. Dr. Harb-Hauser (internal medicine) in particular is an excellent provider. I actually drive from the East Bay to here as I find their care to be above most of the ER Vets in the East Bay.<//Review>

<Review>Would not provide the prescription number of medications they prescribed  to me so I could reorder.  In addition they couldn't remember simple instructions : call the land line . Never called to let us know she would not recover . however they had no problem doing more tests and inflating out bill by 3000+ ; initial we approved the 2,700. I already have a veterinarian I was sent their for emergency purposes they wanted to continue to treat my dog after the emerrgency ; There communication and our wishes where of no concern to them . there main concern is getting new patients but mostly they want your money . the most traumatic, and horrible experience I have had. Would never return . So listening up ; research pet emergency hospitals before you have a pet emergency . if you are referred there as if the is another place . San Francisco Sonoma , Napa,  east bay .< /Review>< pictures>

Not really sure how they prioritize cases. Waited in the parking lot for 1.5hrs and had to phone and remind them that we were waiting outside with a sick puppy. Essentially told us that they are busy and we should try somewhere else. BTW, the potential wait time was never communicated in the initial calls. Don’t think I’ll be back with an emergency.</Text>

This review is specifically for the oncology dept and my absolutely devastating and frustrating experience. We regrettably decided to work with this hospital when our dog was diagnosed with cancer as they were local and convenient. I can’t help but wonder if our dog would still be alive today or would’ve had more time with us had we worked with a vet hospital with an ounce of compassion or communication.

From the beginning, they were extremely disorganized, and the lack of follow up in a timely matter for such a critical situation was unacceptable. We were first scheduled a surgeon consult to remove a mass, later told we actually needed to schedule an oncology consult for a ct scan. After spending thousands of dollars in diagnostics, we were told the dr would call us that evening as with covid we had no contact with the oncologist. Now, if she had called us or emailed or followed up within that week it would’ve been nice. But no, I had to call, leave voicemails, put in notes with front desk, send emails...when you are heart broken and have no idea if your dog is dying it isn’t really the time to leave owners in the dark for 10 days about the prognosis or treatment options.

We did finally get in touch with the dr, who deemed the tumor inoperable, which is understandable and we were on board to begin treatment. We were *not* told that we needed monthly bloodwork, what side affects to look out for, that it is recommended to do regular urinalysis, any possible drug interactions, or any follow up whatsoever in terms of guidance of what to expect, what is next. When we called, emailed, trying to figure out how to get a refill of our dogs chemo, we were first asked if we had been seeing another oncologist and if we wanted to schedule a CT scan (??? Hello, we already paid $4000 for that AT YOUR CLINIC) and later was told she needs bloodwork to continue chemo. News to us! I called to schedule an appt with oncology dept within minutes, and front desk accidentally scheduled the blood draw with the wrong dept. They were apparently unable to internally ask the other dept which blood panels to run for her, so they canceled our appt day of. Then you have to wait days until they check their email or voicemail. Our regular vet clinic was furious and had to call into PESCM to demand that they somehow fit us into their “busy schedule” as their patient needs their CANCER TREATMENT. That worked!

Of the 4 months between discovering our dogs mass and the day that she died, I must have spent 6 weeks calling, emailing, trying to get through to the unresponsive dr and oncology team, lapse of treatment, trying to schedule appointments, being told over and over how under staffed they were. Sure, I get it. Pandemic has been rough on us all, and running a vet hospital is not easy. But have some compassion and refer your clients out if you don’t have the time or ability to treat them. Suddenly one day our dog collapsed, I called into the vet hospital asking what to do. She had just been in 3 days prior and blood work apparently came back normal. I was told by front desk they would call the oncologist and she would get back to us same day. Our dog died hours later. The oncologist never once called us or followed up. Our vet was mortified that the clinic didn’t recommend to do a urinalysis to check for blood in her urine given the situation.

I thought it was so sweet that we received sympathy cards from our regular vet clinic and the pharmacy that provided her cancer treatment...and literally couldn’t even get a call or email back from the oncologist treating our dog the day that she suddenly collapsed. Which, of course comes as no surprise...given the lack of compassion throughout the entire time that she was a patient of theirs.

I hate to leave this negative and long winded review, as the front desk and staff has always been extremely kind and helpful to us. I don’t know if we were just an off case that slipped through the cracks...but I sincerely hope they find a solution to whatever went wrong so that other owners don’t experience the same.</Text>

<Text>Thanks to your staff for doing your best with my dog. I don't know how long she has left, but in the face of that uncertainty it somehow feels very reassuring that you are there and open all night. I appreciate the warm but professional demeanor of everyone I've interacted with at PESCM--it puts me at ease. I feel like my girl is in good hands when I drop her off!</Text></record>

Profit first, animal care second. My heart is broken.

Be kind both ways during an emergency: staff to clients and clients to staff. Both are under extreme stress. Staff have more information as they are inside of the building, but are not emotionally invested in outcomes. Clients sit in cars with little to no insight. Due to COVID clients are no longer treated as partners in care.

Since 2018, I have spent $18,814.81 (photo included) over 46 visits. At no time have Pet ERs been so overwhelmed & GPs & staff so burned out. Still, there are ways to help clients & deescalate stressful situations.

Yesterday, H (7 mos) was hit by an SUV at 4:30pm. I rushed to PESCM & was told a nurse would come get H & sit tight in the lot, but 3hrs later they admitted they had forgotten us.

It's been more than a year since clients could meet with DRs & sit with their animals during a crisis. What is normal for the staff who have visibility is a black hole of fear for a client sitting in the dark for hours in their car.

Close to 10pm Dr. Ng called. H had not been treated for pain. Dr. Ng wanted to run an expensive blood test, so she could give H pain medication known to cause liver damage instead of using gabapentin. This was not a solution, it was designed to increase the bill & put H to sleep as they delayed X-rays.

I was scared, stressed, & still processing losing two senior dogs in traumatic middle-of-the-night crisis situations at PESCM 4 weeks ago.

Dr. Ng said didn't have time to talk about gabapentin. I was transferred to provide my credit card details. The quote included additional medications that hadn't been discussed & no one could explain them to me.

In the confusion, I started to melt down with frustration & panic. I don't believe this would have happened pre-COVID in-person. The discussion was circular, unproductive, & stressful. Leah, Avery, and Taylor decided they did not want to treat H, because I was in too much distress. Avery said they would keep H overnight for $60, but threatened if H went into crisis no one would intervene as she died, hanging up on me.

They staff have hard jobs, but in COVID at this location the evening staff don't appear to see clients are struggling too. Avery & Taylor did not appear equipped with compassion for looking at the situation from a client's experience of being left in the dark, forgotten among other emergencies, having to be financially careful. I also recently went through two traumatic deaths at PESCM.

February 12, 2021

Lucy, 14 yo, treated by Dr. Sablock & Dr. Harb died without dignity.

Dr. Harb spent 10 hours @ $900 running tests/observation. Her recommendation for a senior dog showing signs of cognitive decline (nasal cancer had become brain cancer), only able to walk in a circle, leaning to one side, stuck at walls was "buy a snuffle mat." Two days later, Feb 12, 2021, Lucy was rushed to the ER at 2:30am. The ER night doctor conveyed, "Dr. Harb doesn't like giving bad news. I see a lot of Dr. Harb's patients in the middle of the night in a crisis."
--
Paisley, 15 yo pug (Lucy's sister), regularly treated by Dr. Harb and Dr. Zarfoss. Paisley also died without dignity, crying out, scared, & soaked in urine.

12 days after Lucy died, Paisley had a midnight seizure. The ER was understaffed and the techs wouldn't allow me to hold her in my car for the three hours of wait time.

Instead, Paisley was taken inside, forgotten, & crated for the last three hours of her life alone, cold, & left in a bed soaked with her urine. Per night-time COVID policy, I was only allowed to see Paisley after she was heavily sedated & catheterized for euthanasia. The towel she was wrapped in was wet with cold urine. She was drugged, dysphoric, & scared when she died.

This business has taken advantage of COVID to increase profits by being opaque and not meeting with clients. The default is to run up bills, which would have been less likely pre-COVID.

PESCM can do better to close the empathy gap, which would help everyone.<//Text>

Help with our very ill cat. Open 24hrs. Very respectful and have a special tent area set up for saying goodbye to your pet. Only issue was the somehow list our pet carrier...we did forget it it after we left when furbaby crossed, but we were not thinking clearly at that time. It is a big blue carrier, so not sure how it got lost??? Oh well. Would still recommend to friends<//Text>

We had the need to bring our cat in at about 6 in the morning ... he was obviously suffering. We were so impressed with everything about this place ... from the initial phone call to the greeting at the center ... everybody was so caring and professional. The vet explained everything to us very clearly but with compassion. They handled the "end of life" procedure with so much dignity and respect ... they even had a "tent room" set up out back for COVID reasons so we could spend a few final minutes with "Bailey" before we left.
What was obviously a tough day for us was made immeasurably better by our experience at PESCM ... we highly recommend them.</text>

Emergency trip in the night.  Sitting in the car in the parking lot due to Covid and yet, I felt included in my dog's care and made decisions based on understanding her condition and costs.  It was a good experience even though it was not a good out come the next day.  These were all very warm and knowledgeable people.  Dr Saige was the vet on, but the entire team from reception to tech to vet could not have been more supportive, knowledgeable, and understanding.</text>

I wish I had more explanation if possible for what may have caused the death of my dog. He was old but was happy and playful within week of his death at PESCM. I think maybe the doctor did not have enough time to fully understand his situation I have not been told if he had a stroke and this caused death or any explanation.

I would only go here if it were an actual emergency. Expect to pay top dollar price for sub par care. The communication will be a fast auctioneer style reading of medical terminology  that can confuse and overwhelm a pet parent.  leading to a request of a  deposit on the low end estimate of financial resposibility.< /review>

I was happy with their quick response and turn around in helping my puppy. They initially told me it would an hour to two hour wait, but after checking in it only took 20 min before getting him seen and then an hour or so before he was back to me. The doctor was thorough and staff was kind.< /review>

<Text>Recently one of my dogs started to display erratic behavior / very quickly her breathing was off and she lost all of her energy. I knew something was wrong and called my vet / after I explained the symptoms, the vet suggested emergency care. We rushed there and Sadie was taken in quickly - over the next 36 hours, she had 3 seizures. Throughout her care, all of the staff were caring, professional and knowledgeable. All 3 of the veterinarians were wonderful and took extreme care and time in explaining what they were observing and their recommendations. For me and my 10.5 year old dog, this was a scary experience, made manageable by the great team at Pet Emergency & Specialty Care. Thank you - we are very grateful!<//Text><rating>5</rating>< gmapID>

Because of the pandemic, veterinary services are overwhelmed with new patients now. When my dog needed to be seen my regular vet (and several others that I called) couldn't get him in. I took him to Pet Emergency in San Rafael and they were able to see and treat him that same day.  I appreciate the care you gave my dog and that you were there for me when my regular vet couldn't be.<//Review>

Very good care. Empathetic, courteous, as prompt as possible under circumstances. Please be slightly more generous with days of med.'s prescribed (as situation warrants).

My Siamese Jack was diagnosed w/ Idiopathic Cystitis & given 5 days worth of med. Unfortunately, his regular vet moved & I had to scramble to find a new one. His med.s were refilled w/o another visit-very important!< /Review>

< review>
I really appreciated how customer-friendly this was. I thought my dog had a foxtail. I waited for 2 hours in the parking lot, and then someone looked at his paw and told me it didn't look like a foxtail, which meant I could go home. I also really appreciated that they were willing to let me leave my dog there until he could be evaluated. My experience at other emergency vets has been that you have to be willing to sit for the whole day and not eat unless someone brings you food. This was much more convenient and pleasant. That even though my dog's issue wasn't as severe as others, they made time to take a quick look so I wouldn't wait needlessly</review>

This is the second time you saved my baby's life! My cat brushed up against some lily flowers and was covered in pollen. You took her in and watched her closely, making sure she received adequate fluids and checking her kidney levels. I drove all the way out from San Francisco. I'm so happy to have her back home with me, happy and healthy! Thank you, PESCM!!</text>

I can not say enough good things about the doctors and staff at PESCM. This was the first time we have had to bring Ripley in and it was above and beyond positive experience. When we had years of visits to the oncology department with Link, our last corgi, they were so incredible as well. Really great and caring, thorough, patient, knowledgeable people. Even though the emergency turned out to be minor and even though the parking lot was FULL, they did not rush us. They took the time to explain things, listen to us and answer out questions. It had a huge impact.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Dr Levenson and the team here at Pet Emergency and Specialty Clinic are the absolute best.
I appreciate that they err on the side of caution vs casual when it has come to the health of my dog. Dr Levenson, specifically, was extremely thorough in his updates to me as we determined next steps.
While this clinic can have longer wait times than usual (it is one of - if not the only - 24 hour emergency clinic in the area) and higher than average prices, after bringing my dog here on two separate occasions and having exceptional care shown towards my dog and me in both instances, I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else in the case of an emergency.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1604961571254, 'text': 'Hello Roxanne, thank you for the feedback on your experience.

I live in Point Richmond and have never been to a vet or pet hospital before. When the emergency arose, I had called many vets in the East Bay and all they did was give me each others phone numbers as they couldn't see my cat. Then one of them gave me your name and you told me to come right away. In true Marin style everything worked like clockwork and quickly. I was so grateful when the doc told me he couldn't really see anything wrong and I was able to leave with just pain meds. My kitty is almost back to herself now 5 days later, so I was very relieved when she started feeling better. It's always nice to hear from the pros and I appreciate the doctor's assessment; I appreciated the call from the doctor while I waited in my car due to not being allowed in the hospital for Covid safety reasons.< /Text>

Before my visit on 12-04-2020 I had not had a bad experience with customer service at PESCM.

I've heard that PESCM was recently acquired by a chain of vet hospitals.

I wonder if new owners have implemented new procedures at the reception desk that would explain the protracted runaround I got after being promised a timely report on the result of a progesterone test.<//review>

I have had to take both of my dogs to PESCM on separate occasions and have been very happy with the care they have received. On our last visit I was happy to have the same physician treat my dog that previously treated her. I was impressed that he remembered her and her behavior when she was ill previously. Unfortunately, when I returned the following day to pick up a prescription that was ordered for us I was disappointed in my experience when I spoke to a member of the nursing staff.  There wasn't any compassion for my dogs situation or my dogs discomfort.  Her words were insensitive and rude.  I have asked for a member of their management team to call me.  I hope they care enough to call so that I can share my experience.
It is always stressful when your pet is ill and you have to take them to the emergency.  I would expect that the staff would be better trained to handle situations that call for kindness and compassion. When I think about how she spoke to me and the words she used I still get a sick feeling in my stomach.  Both of my dogs are senior dogs with complicated health issues and will be on medications for the rest of their lives.  Because of this they will most likely need emergency care in the future.  I wish this unfortunate situation hadn't happened.  I really wanted PESCM to be a hospital I could count on as part of my dogs health care team when needed.<//Text>

Then after forgetting me in the parking lot ,for an hour they refused to even offer my hurt dog help and were rude.

I called the office and after the nurse told me i should of never been told they could help?

What?

I used to love this place ,and as a professional trainer this is unacceptable to do to anyone.

I would not be as nearly upset if you had not done this to me the last time.

Overall it was a good experience. The only thing would be that during discharge take a little more time to speak to the client about the medication instead of rushing through it. Communicated very well throughout the whole process and wait time wasn't long.<//Text>

<Text>If they had brought my dog out within 20 minutes of saying she was done and they were sending her right out, I would have given a perfect score. To extend my wait by 50 minutes after my pup was treated and observed and after I had paid, and after they told me she was coming right out, is just silly, and unprofessional.  Otherwise, my pup was well taken care of, and Dr Levenson was informed, helpful, kind and responsive.<//Text>< Pics>

Dr. Bowie and staff fixed my girl!!!   I found PESCM via an online search a while ago. I recently visited PESCM for a 2nd emergency visit.   My dog had serious gastro-intestinal problems. PESCM was compassionate and caring for my girl.  I was given options of taking her home (and giving her iv fluids) or letting her stay and PESCM do that.  I opted for the stay at hospital option as they have staff onsite 24/7 (no animal is left alone overnight).  I was also able to call in and check with a nurse on my dog's condition which gave me some peace of mind. The price of the care was fair in price considering the nature of the business.   I highly recommend PESCM.</review>

<time>1575606239718</time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Great place. My cat came home with a big old nasty looking abscess on his cheek. This was my first abscess so I freaked a little. This was 9:30 pm on a Saturday night. Called one vet whose message said to call Pet Emergency & Specialty Center. I was apprehensive, the words Special, Emergency and Marin usually mean lots of money. I called, they were super nice and the base Emergency room visit was $105. Reasonable in my opinion. Got there at 10 pm. Everyone, literally everyone, there was super nice and pleasant. The place was very clean and didn't smell. They took great care of my cat and I was walking out just a tad after midnight. The whole thing cost just under $300. I figured it would be closer to $500 to I was happy about that. I highly recommend.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>If you have the unfortunate need for an emergency pet hospital visit, this place makes the experience better. The front desk staff are great, friendly and helpful. The vet tech staff communicate clearly, and the vet I worked with was amazing.

<review>This cat had a "torn claw" jumping from a fence. His usual vet was on vacation. (The cat had been well treated HERE, many years ago  -- before the fancy remodeling.)
We were willing to pay higher ER veterinary prices. HOWEVER we were made to wait for well over an hour, before the cat was MISDIAGNOSED with a "missing digit," kept overnight for treatment, and released in the morning with a $600 bill for excessive unnecessary charges! X-rays, "boarding", insistance on sending him home with a collar he didn't need to wear, and unnecessary tranquilizers!
(A torn claw needs only to be cleaned, carefully removed, and it will quickly heal on its own.)
For true ER emergencies and middle of the night vet care, this place has a monopoly on the business in Marin County.  (And sadly, for euthanasia in the middle of the night.) Just be careful. Try to wait for your regular vet if possible.  Unless you enjoy paying for the free coffee and fancier ambiance.</review><UserId.>104687229517068000095< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>We were already heart broken over losing Puddin our foster. We requested and paid for a private cremation. It's been 17 days her foster called them and she was told they don't know how but she was cremated in a general cremation and we would not be getting Puddin's ashes back.

Michelle the medical director thought I would feel better knowing this has never happened before. I don't care that it’s never happened before the problem is it happened.

She's awful and so is their service. I hope she never has to go through what they are putting her foster and us through.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Everyone here is so understanding and helpful especially if you're coming in with an injured animal. They triage very quickly and explain things very clearly plus give you both a low and a high estimate of costs. I've been here with two different cats, for very different reasons, and would give them ten stars if I could! So grateful they are open 24/7 for all of us.<//Review><GmapID>0x80859a3b08246ae3:0x73dd87ce4c42c354< /GmapID>< user_name>

My biggest worry was how long it took for my cat to be evaluated, to receive fluids, to get tests, and wait-time for an appointment with IM. He had 2 Emergency visits (instead of 1) because of the unavailability of services on weekends and during the completely-booked weekly IM schedule. More Vets are needed!</text>

<Text>The lady who answered the phone around 12 noon on 3/27 was incredibly rude and unprofessional. I called to request a refill for a medication they prescribed my dog for his arthritis. The lady proceeds to scream into the phone that they're an emergency only vet and don't do medication refills, even though the gave me a refill for the prescription already. She would not help me... Looks like she's rude AND doesn't know how her own place of employment works... Ill call back and hopefully get someone else or just make an appointment at another vet...<//Text>< pictures>

Awful follow up; after taking out dog last night in for what was referred to as FIBROCARTILAGINOUS EMBOLISM a diagnosis resulting in our pet's hind leg being paralyzed, they sent us home & advised us to call anytime for questions. We called twice with no return phone call within 8 hours of discharge. The front desk person could not be MORE unhelpful! I hope she never has to experience a pet in danger or sick she migh have a clue on how to be useful and provide intelligent and caring assistance.  The veterinarian who assisted us as nice as he was, we now find after
doing our own research gave us incomplete data, inaccurate data and  a LACK of key discharge instructions putting our dog in danger. I am AGAIN disappointed by this group that seem to have a monopoly on emergency pet care in Marin County.  Drive anywhere but here to save you pet.< /review><user_id>102628906711595771791<//user_id>< Rating>

<Time>1573087258333<//Time><rating>2<//rating><text>Great experience with vets.... but....

Long term care of my dog with a derm issue. The derm vet left without patients being notified and I can't get an extension on my prescription without driving up from SF, paying the fee (they were very clear about the cost!), and seeing a vet who's not a derm specialist (which is what I need). Since they no longer offer the services I need, it'd would've been professional to let me know, rather than me wondering why they hadn't called to schedule an appointment.... While it doesn't relate to the care I received (I loved the derm vet), this is not professional and is a very disappointing lack of attention to detail.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>We have taken both dogs and cats to pet emergency over the years; we're so thankful for the services they provide.  The Vets are always amazing: knowledgeable, kind, and caring. If you have a pet in need of emergency care, you won't find a better option. They are very expensive so be prepared, but you get what you pay for with them.< /review>< userid>

<Text>I really can't say enough about these guys..... their bedside manner and patience is exceptional... they see so much emotion day in and day out, and they manage people's sad moments really well.  The waiting room is huge, and inviting, with a great coffee machine (not that it matters when it comes to your loved one).

But they are affordable, available, and really care.  They even gave a bevvy of options in what to do for our little pup who banged up his nose, and let us schedule a follow up appointment, while allowing us to cancel it last minute without hassle or fees.  It's really rare.  I sort of don't want to have to go back, because it means it's an emergency... but if I have to, from vet care, emergencies and even hospice help and counseling.... they've got me for life. Thanks guys!< /Text>< Pictures>

Putting down a pet no matter how long they have been in your life is a very hard thing to go through. The vet and all the nurses went above an beyond to make sure it wasn't any more painful for either me or my dog. There were quite a few things I really appreciated. The first one was anytime they took her out of the room they brought her back to me ASAP and put her in my arms, they picked up on the fact that I didn't want to let go of my dog so that was incredibly helpful and important to me. Secondly I was given the option to be there when she passed and I took it. They moved us to room 1 and let me say my good byes for as long as I needed and when I was ready to let her go I pushed a button and the vet came in, explained to me very calmly what she was going to do and what responses my dog might have to the injections. The vet was amazing! Then after my dog past the vet gave me time to say goodbye again and a few minutes later I pushed the button again and a nurse came in and she treated my dog as if it was her own. I couldn't ask for a better experience during such a hard time. Even the receptionist was so sweet and caring.<//Text><Date>1428539313299< /Date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was referred here by my regular veterinarian Dr. Berkely, because my dog has severe skin problems. The office got me in within 24 hours with Dr. Wilson who is a dermatologist for animals.

Dr. Wilson was very thorough,  she went through my dogs medical records, plus listen to what I had to say, and treated me as well as my dog with the utmost respect.

Dr. Wilson prescribed what I consider to be a very conservative and affordable treatment.  Unfortunately,  we will be going back for allergy testing when I pay off my care credit card.

The staff is amazing,  friendly and this place is BUSY!!!</Review>

These folks are incredible. Took my dog in at 4am. They pulled a gurney out and had him in treatment within 2 minites. Unfortunately he died a few minutes later but not for lack of emergency response from these folks.  What a dedicated staff.</text>

Ours was a specialty visit. Besides being frail with kidney disease and recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism, my 16 yo Chihuahua, Pegasus, has vision loss in both eyes. Pegasus recently was noticibly less active and I suspected his one good eye was deteriorating to the point that he was fearful of possibly falling or bumping into things. I took him in to see if his health was strong enough to undergo testing and possibly corrective surgery. Dr. Zarfoss is an eye specialist and very thorough to the patient's benefit. She was objective and suggested options to pursue that fit my objective of avoiding invasive tests and treatments. She heard my many concerns without judgement and described all the available options that I could pursue from surgery to end of life care that would provide me with the full spectrum of support to compassionately provide Pegasus the care to ensure a quality transition. I very much appreciate knowing that there are well qualified doctors like Dr. Zarfoss in my community that I can turn during this anxiety ridden phase of Pegasus' life.< /text>

<review>Expensive but effective care. Our walk-in wait time was about 20 minutes on a wet, Friday afternoon. A consultation is $98 and we paid $477 all up. Worth it for peace of mind having blood tests, anti-nausea injection, and subcutaneous hydration done then and there for our beloved dachshund who was suffering from continual vomiting over a few days (we couldn't get an appointment with the local vet). The Doctor gave us a fair assessment about our treatment and test options that didn't feel like upsells. Lovely, modern facilities with great features like pet floor mats, complimentary coffee machine, WiFi and charging cables for phones. The front desk staff, vet team doctors and nurses were friendly, knowledgeable and compassionate--extremely desirable traits for an emergency clinic. A far superior experience to previous ER vets we've visited in TX and MO.</review><Time>1549342198550</Time>< Pics>

Nice and friendly staff. We brought our puppy early morning because she has been whining all night and has a bit blood in her urine. We learned that she might have urine track infection. The only thing to note if you are bringing a puppy who is not fully vaccinated is that they may treat a lot of sick pets, so be mindful about putting your pet on the floor.<//text>

This is a terrible place to bring an animal if you need to see someone within 45 minutes. I was there with my dog who was having neurological problems. The girl at the desk took my name etc. I sat down with the dog and waited. There was no one in the place but me. I asked the girl at the desk when someone would please see me. Reply "they are taking care of the dogs in the back". Lucky for me my Vet was due to be in his office at 8am. After 45 minutes of no interest in helping me or my dog I left and drove to my regular Vet. He was there and took me right away and administered the drugs to help my dog. He is wonderful. Dr Frye. Try him, at least you dont have to wait until something terrible happens because of lack of interest in helping your pet as the Pet Emergency did the morning of a Saturday when no one was there but me. So much for being an emergency place to go.

<Review>They have save the day for us many times (well, ok, saved the night - because our dogs seem to save emergencies for nighttime :)  I can't say enough about how kind, caring and efficient they are. Watching the Vet's and Tech work and handle everyone's fears, and anxiety is marvelous.
Even on a busy night, the wait time is less than a human ER - and the care is top notch. I've brought several loved ones there over the past 8 or 9 years and have nothing but praise.
Thanks for always being there!!</Review><name>Mike Wolpert<//name>< Gmap_id>

<review>If you can't find parking in their lots, they told me it was ok to park in the Harbor Freight one across the street. Also, don't follow Google directions from the East Bay, get off an exit early or late because you can't actually turn right into the left turn lane for Bellam if there is any traffic and trying to turn around after having to miss it sucks.</review>< gmapID>

I brought my fiancée in today for extractions to prepare him for partial permanent dentures. Mind you we had a thorough consultation with the dentist last month and also spoke to one of the girls in the office at his initial appointment to review what was covered and what was not. We explained to this girl that anything that is not covered we cannot do. She explained to us, again, what was covered and even showed us a video of the permanent denture procedure. We came in today exited to move forward! Well, they called us back only to tell us that, if he wanted to be sedated for his procedure, he would need to pay $1200!! Then they went on to tell us that he was getting a bone graft today that wasn't covered by insurance and he would only be getting extractions.  WHY WASN'T THIS EXPLAINED TO US BEFOREHAND??? WHY WOULD THEY TELL US IT WAS COVERED THEN SPRING THIS ON US THE DAY OF? I even called yesterday to ask what was going to be done today exactly and what the post procedure instructions would be and NO ONE new the answer. Unprofessional and plain stupid people. F-👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬<//Text>

Horrible doctor. All she cares about is money. She took care of 4 patients and still hasn't began to work on me. I do not recommend this place to anyone if you care about your time and teeth< /Text>

<text>Oscar was great! I’m always so uncomfortable when I go to the dentist and his jokes made me feel a lot better.
Also, shout out to Dr. Patel, who made quick work with the plaque. Looking forward to seeing her again tomorrow for the other part of my cleaning.... well maybe not looking forward to it so much... LOL but I’m glad I have them both!<//text>< pics>

Front desk personnel and financing reps are good at explaining the terms and answering questions.
Have a fear of dentists from bad dental work as a child. The dental hygienist (Bach Traw RDH) did a very deep cleaning which was 8 years past due from not going to the dentist for a long time. She did very well, thank you very much.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Ok. First let me say, I’ve been thru MANY dentists and for the very first time.  I have found a true angel. Dr. Patel did what NONE of my past dentists did. She simply asked me what I want to do/would like.  She has a calming presence and we had an excellent rapport right from the beginning. Another thing I appreciate her for is that she explained everything to me and made it super easy to understand.  For once, I felt like a human FIRST and not just a patient or someone to make a big buck from.  The only thing I regret, is not finding her years ago but I am so excited for what’s ahead on my journey to fix my dental issues.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>I had to give one star to write something. I have NOT visited this dental office and I want to state that the most recent bad reviews are what convinced me not to go. :/ I don’t think it’s worth the risk with all that’s been said about the bad experiences had....<//Review>< UserId.>

I love the way I was treated worried about getting most of my lower teeth pulled trust me they were so gentle if I could I would give them 10 stars I can’t wait for my false teeth had to work on my false teeth some more and they will keep working with me to get them to fit properly can’t say enough good things about them</review>

If I could give negative stars they would have -100stars! Checked insurance website, said this location would do the work needed and be covered at a percentage. Made an appointment for my husband, got there a few minutes early for paperwork, waited for 30 past appointment time, got called in back, he sat there and waited for quite awhile longer before being seen. If he was not in dire pain we would have left long before this. He got a quote, found out insurance “didn’t cover the work” needed. He went ahead and got the work started for a build up and crown. The assistant was confused the entire time, kept telling people she didn’t know what she was doing. The temporary crown was made incorrectly and didn’t fit. Another assistant helped and it still didn’t fit well. Left the office, within a few hours the temp crown fell off and was broken. Called next morning was seen again, after waiting again for a long period of time. Same thing temp crown didn’t fit well, came off within hours of leaving the office. This repeated 4 or 5 times, needing to leave work early to go to office to get it fixed and waiting for hours. Spoke to dentist on one of the visits that I was worried the permanent crown would not fit, was told it would be fine. Permanent came in, assistant couldn’t get it in, had it backwards, then tried to cement in backwards. The entire back of tooth was still exposed. A different dentist was on duty and they sent it back to lab with a new impression, done by the confused assistant who still said she didn’t know how to do it. Again the temporary crown fell off within hours of leaving. Called our previous dentist, asked to get a temporary placed, she fixed the build up, did an impression, made a temporary crown (which stayed in place for months during Covid shutdown) and placed a permanent crown. All of this before the permanent crown was available from western dental. I’ve disputed the charges, credit card went ahead and paid the full amount, no crown in my possession as of today and then they had the nerve to ding my credit report! The front desk is confused about everything. The office manager is unhelpful. The dentist is only after money. The assistants are uneducated on protocols and procedures. DO NOT go here even if your life is on the line! Worst dentist office ever!</review>

If ther was a zero star, I would not hesitate to give to this missed up place . My appointment was at 10 am , they did see my son till 2 pm and even then we were waiting inside for another hour until we left without any procedures done . This Patel , the manager is rude , dose not explain what is going on , and ..... .this is not the first time it happens . This place is dirty, equipments are old from stone age era , not sanitized. Do not ever think about going here . I am sure how ppl can give 4 star rating here because every one I talked to , was and is unhappy about this place .</review>

<review>DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! They well Charge you for service not rendered! I broke a crown went I went in there for a replacement. First of all they show me a video about deep cleaning. Before I had even seen the dentist. Red flag! If you go into an establishment and , they’re showing you a video before you see the doctor about deep cleaning get the hell out of there. Next the dentist comes in it looks my teeth and to my surprise she says I need a deep cleaning. Sidenote I thought they took my insurance but they didn’t. I told her that I had broken crown I need a replacement. Was not interested in deep cleaning. Keep in mind if you already have a crown and it’s broken the previous Dentist has done the build up! All they have to do at this point is make an impression and order a crown that fits. So I agreed to the price which was a buildup and crown. I asked why do I need a build up and then Dentist said as she was cleaning my build up that this is the build up. Lol . So here comes the temporary which was made off of my broken tooth and didn’t last 24 hours. I go back after it broke she tries again with the same impression. Didn’t last 24 hours. I go back again a different person tries with the same impression. Didn’t last 24 hours.
I go back again finally there’s an assistant that does a fairly good job it lasted seven days. Finally my crown comes in. I go in for my appointment and there’s a different dentist there. She tries to fit the crown on my Tooth. And she says it doesn’t fit and that I  have to come back when the other dentist is there. I’m out of there at this point done with this place. Went to a different dentist got gold tooth for $900 And a temporary that lasted all through Covid two months. I cancel my Discover card  for 1064.00 For services unrendered. But somehow they still want to charge me for the whole thing. And they put it in collections you would think at least that I would get the crown to hold onto! Now it’s on my credit Report with false information. We called their home office they said this location wants to charge me $900 for temporaries? In these crazy times stay away from Western dental! It’s all about the money not about taking care of people.< /review>< Pictures>

I'd give a zero stars if I could.
The employees should communicate with clients better.
Apperently I received service and was in their system from 3 years ago but they could have told me I didn't qualify for the free exam over the phone 2 days before my appointment.
I wasted my time and money going in and was simply turned away I believe this was their clerical mistake and I should be compensated a free exam and x-ray. I do not recommend Western dental because they don't care about their clients enough to establish a good report. If they would have simply let me know I wouldn't have taken a day off work.<//Text>

Robert was so friendly and awesome from the moment I walked in. Usually I’m pretty scared of the dentist office but he made me feel comfortable and at home right away. He answered every single one of my million questions and he even gave me some advice about my teeth. I HIGHLY recommend coming to western dental in poway and if you get Robert, you’re lucky 😎😋< /review>

I recently learn about this place because it’s nearby my home. I went in for a consultation and I must say, it’s the nicest dental office I have been to in a while! The staff is so friendly especially Toni she’s just the sweetest! Aside from informative, respectful and professional; she genuinely cares about the patients. Everyone made me feel so welcomed and I’ll definitely be recommending to friends, I’m looking forward to my next appointment! 😊</text>

<Review>ZERO STARS

I dont recomend going to Western Dental unless you want to be treated likea source of income and not a human. I have a tooth that needs to be pulled, my entire right side of my face is in excruciating pain into my neck all because they didnt fill my tooth when they said they would and it cracked. Then I made an appointment to pull it because they said it need to go. And they turned me away and said they couldn't help. I then found out they never put in requests theybsaid the did. And they are pushing all thier patients to give them 5 stars. DON'T GO TO WESTERN DENTAL< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< Pics>

< Review>
Special thanks to Sherein Farag personally love this place. I'm getting everything I need done for an amazing price. They're not trying to rip us off. They're just trying to get people in. I think Western dental has a little bit of a reputation sometimes because it seems lower grade but I got to say it's an amazing place to get work done on your mouth. And the staff is really fun and friendly.</Review>

I really enjoyed the Poway Western Dental. All the girls smile and even when you wait they keep you updated every step of the way. It's been 7 years since i been to this office I'm 24 now, i had to get x-rays and Erika G handled all my blabbing, i love a conversationalist especially when im nervous as it is to be in the office. Thank you for a great time and even better service!</text>

Don’t go to this Dentist! There is always a looong wait!  My wife had to get her teeth cleaned and they wanted to charge her thousands of dollars. We were shocked. I asked if she had any cavities and the receptionist said they will not know until they clean her teeth. I asked why the xrays didn’t show the cavities. She didn’t have an answer for me....We went to another dentist and got her teeth cleaned at a fraction of the cost and there were no cavities!

My son had a check up here recently and the receptionist was the one to tell me the status of his exam. I thought to myself, “why isn’t the dentist talking to me about my son and is the receptionist qualified to update me on my sons teeth?”

I always regret making an appointment here!</Text>

<Text>I am updating my review from 1 star to 5 star due to the fact that they are still operable at times like these and have made various changes to their procedure. This place has gotten better overtime and have acknowledged the feedback from their reviews and adjusted accordingly to. Yes, there is still going to be a bit of wait time and that's just inevitable with how things are going on with the world right now especially during unfortunate times like these. The wait times have taught me to be more patient and understanding, it will only get better overtime. The Orthodontists do a very great job as well and are efficient with their procedures in keeping things flowing. They have more limited workers now I assume so just try to keep that in mind when you're waiting outside.

< review>
I could make an appointment so fast and the service is good. The wait time was so fast. Gloria was my dental assistant and she was fast and patient.
Update: if you have Medi-Cal insurance, don't go there. They told me that my teeth don't have any problem and didn't diagnose anything. I saw another doctor and realized I need some fillings and other treatment. They don't care about Medi-Cal patient even I asked to charge me if my insurance doesn't cover.</review>

I must say I am very pleased with there overall service. I am always nervous going in to a place and trusting someone with your health and life. I felt safe. Was a little wait but was worth it. The staff is great and so was the dentist. She knows her stuff. They were great with working out plans and getting me through my process and easy and less painful as possible. I even went to rest room and came out there was no tissue to dry my hands and the lady even noticed to walk over to me sitting in waiting room and passed me paper towels and apologized. I am very big on customer service veing a customer service rep myself and am very pleased and proud of what I saw in this office today!. Thanks guys you rock!<//Text>

<Time>1571419930180< /Time><rate>5<//rate><text>I was assisted today by Sherein Farag for dental x-rays and pictures. She went above and beyond in her professionalism and was wonderful at her job.

Ever since I was a child I have struggled with dental x-rays due to a quick gag reflex. In ADDITION to that, the office that Sherein Farag works in only offered mouth pieces that painfully dug into the sides of my mouth. She took the time to fashion a mouth piece that worked for me, and even moved me to a smaller x-ray room so I would be more comfortable, all the while working quickly and efficiently.

I was thoroughly impressed with her patience, expertise, and kindness as she performed her job with excellence.</text>< pictures>

I must say I am very pleased with there overall service. I am always nervous going in to a place and trusting someone with your health and life. I felt safe. Was a little wait but was worth it. The staff is great and so was the dentist. She knows her stuff. They were great with working out plans and getting me through my process and easy and less painful as possible. I even went to rest room and came out there was no tissue to dry my hands and the lady even noticed to walk over to me sitting in waiting room and passed me paper towels and apologized. I am very big on customer service veing a customer service rep myself and am very pleased and proud of what I saw in this office today!. Thanks guys you rock!</Text>

I’m happy I found this place! Dentists have a hard time with me as I tend to gag. Robert A. did a fantastic job with distracting me and putting salt in my mouth so I’d forget the gagging and think of only the salt while he did his procedures. He was super personable and did a great job, I had a dentist at another office who gave up on me because of the gagging and Robert A. helped me get over the gagging. I’m super happy and proud of myself lol and thanks to his help. Office is pleasant, wait times were short and I got appointment on same day. Highly recommend!<//text>

< Review>
This place needs to get it together. I arrived here 30 minutes early to my appointment and wasn't taken in till over an hour. There were only 3 other patients in the waiting room. And even when I'm taken into the exam room, I'm left to wait even more. It was frustrating. To any future patients, know an appointment here will take most of your day. I can tell their organization is off. Staff keep asking each other wants going on, communication is off, and they don't seem to even care they left people waiting for hours when I mentioned this problem to them. They just deflected my question and weren't sure what the situation was either. I'm never coming back here. Highly do not recommend this place.</Review>

<review>I had a good experience with the dentist here, I came in for X rays the first day as a walk in. Next time I was scheduled for the deep cleaning (or the scaling and root planing appt).  My treatment was quick painless and effective. I have had this procedure done 4 years ago at private practice of another dentist and this time is was so much more comfortable. My 5 stars.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Sherein Farag had to keep repeating the x-ray because I have extra bone growth and it was painful. I went to a different dental provider elsewhere and she actually explained to me that I had extra bone growth and attempted to make the x ray as pain free as possible and that worked much better than western dental.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Sharma is a great and friendly dentist. I like the staff too. However, when I'm approached with the things I need if there are some I can or do not want it needs to be removed from list. I will agree if I feel it is something I really need and can afford or covered by insurance. I don't like being pressured into payments of things I know I can't afford. Otherwise I enjoy the atmosphere and the friendly smiles of the staff.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I really love it here! I’ve never waited longer than about 10-15 mins. The orthodontist is very friendly makes you feel comfortable and everyone asks and makes sure you’re feeling fine. Toni at the front desk always greets with a smile and is very nice and helpful with any questions or concerns you may have. Would totally recommend to my friends and family coming here!</Text>

I do not recommend !!! Read carefully the reviews below, I think many positive reviews are fake. Today I was very upset. I came to you for help and you ............ still can not calm down. You guys are professional liars! I can not wish you good luck. You are the worst!</text>

<review>I really love it here! I’ve never waited longer than about 10-15 mins. The orthodontist is very friendly makes you feel comfortable and everyone asks and makes sure you’re feeling fine. Toni at the front desk always greets with a smile and is very nice and helpful with any questions or concerns you may have. Would totally recommend to my friends and family coming here!< /review>< pics>

Based on a referral from a friend, I took my son into the Poway location for braces and received the best customer service from Toni at the front desk.  We had an excellent experience and the staff in the back performed wonders with my sons braces.  Thanks to Toni we were seen by the Dr. at our appointment time, on time.</Text>

Dr. Sharma is a great and friendly dentist. I like the staff too. However, when I'm approached with the things I need if there are some I can or do not want it needs to be removed from list. I will agree if I feel it is something I really need and can afford or covered by insurance. I don't like being pressured into payments of things I know I can't afford. Otherwise I enjoy the atmosphere and the friendly smiles of the staff.<//text>

Wanted braces for my son, took some x-ray and did oral exam which was 100% covered by insurance. A few months later I received bills and when I questioned what they were for, I never got an answer, I made follow up with customer service and they said they will take care of that. A few months later am receiving a collection letter from a professional bureau that I still owe money to western dental, so I forward my letter of complaint to them as required before being put on collection and reported on my credit report. I never heard a response from them instead a month later it’s now been reported on my credit for collection. The amount on dispute is $160, this is very absurd!!!<//Review><resp>{'time': 1530639352003, 'text': 'Benn, thank you for taking some time out of your day to express your concerns.

Customer service has been great but it's such an old building it should be updated. There's some cracks on the floors and some of the tiles are halfway broken off. Also one of the outlets I saw in an exam room was broken with exposed socket. If it was fixed I'd say this is a great place to come in my opinion.</text>

Wait time too long.
My first appointment was 14:30 09/14/2018 and I checked-in at 14:00, but they start took X-ray on 15:45, then at 16:30 I can finally to see a dentist.
My second appointment was 10:30 09/22/2018 and I checked-in at 10:15, I have not been called until 11:00.
I have no chance to see a dentist on my second appointment because I left at 11:00.
I just saw many people checked-in after me, but they can been called before me.
So disappointed.
I am too old to have enough time to wait.<//text>

<Text>Worse dentistry ever, I was on time on my appointment, I have to wait an hour to see the doctor, then another 30 min to get a shot, another 40min to get my teeth polished then another 1 hour to see the doctor for filling, more than 3 hours waiting that we usually takes 30 min in other dentistries.

<text>I have been using this office for several years.  The dentist is never fun but I have received quality care at reasonable prices.  They have only recommended and done work I required unlike other offices which continuously try to upsale.  I will continue to use Western-Dental Poway for all my needs.</text>< pictures>

Sherein Farag was professional, welcoming and endearing. As someone who doesn’t like going to the dentist, having her here made the experience far more bareable for me!<//review>

I really wish I would have read these reviews before I came. I had the same horrible experience that most others have described. Had my kids here for appointment at 10:45. Was well after 12 by the time they were seen. I had to tell 4 different people the reason we were there. One employee mentioned us having to wait to talk to dentist until after everyone's lunch break! Oh really, guess what we were hungry too after being there for over 2 hours! Get it together people! You need a better scheduling system and learn to communicate and/Or take notes!</Text>

<date>1544845756312</date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>UPDATE:
Came in today once again (now a month later) due to pain from the same infection/abscess site. They drained it once and packed it for me shortly after my previous review. I waited for authorization and am still waiting for the oral surgeon to be available to attend to the root canals I was told I needed. I understand there being a back log of patients as this is a clinic, but what I do NOT understand is waiting for over 40min and NOT being seen when I am in obvious pain. They did nothing for me. No exam, no questions, absolutely nothing. They WERE, however, very on top of getting my daughter's information entered into their system and doing an exam on HER so as to acquire a new patient. I am very disappointed, especially as I believe I was extremely understanding of the 30min-45min-1.5 hour long wait times each time I've gone in, and then again every they pulled me into the back room. I didn't mention being left in the chair and neglecting to numb me out, then numbing me and leaving me so long I had to be re-numbed two and three times, bc I figured that was due to the heavy patient load, and that's "just what you get at clinics." I am now being told that while Medi-Cal covers my root canals, it will NOT cover crowns.....but they HIGHLY recommend their in-house payment plans....at 17+% interest. NOT. Being told that prefab crowns are not covered is entirely contrary to what I found written on the Denti-Cal website. Apparently, given the numerous other reviews/updates just like mine now, this seems to be a pattern with Western Dental. Run far away. Run so very far, and run fast. If you don't believe me, check out their BBB complaints. I did. It's abysmal, to say the least. While Hilda, Sherein, Gloria, and Erica are phenomenal, I'm terrified at the thought of going back to this dental chop shop.

ORIGINAL POST:
Everyone here is absolutely stellar. Caring, compassionate staff all around. Came in Saturday due to pain because of a broken tooth and abscess. The x-ray tech was very gentle and understanding; he stopped twice to let me ride out the pain before continuing. Dr Sharma was very thorough in developing a game plan to knock everything out. Today, I got multiple fillings and a cleaning with Dr Beik; both she and Sherein inquired about my comfort at regular intervals. Sherein was very attentive, and Gloria(?) made sure I got answers to all my questions. Hilda was an absolute angel, watching my busy almost 3 y/o daughter, as negotiations for her care today fell through last minute. The wait time here may be longer than other places, but it is well worth it for the level of care and support these amazing people provide. I know I forgot names, but I'll definitely be back to learn them!

The main problem is they are understaffed, there’s just one dentist O N E and like 3000 assistants (?) the last time I went my appointment was at 10 am and I left at 1:15 pm. I wasted one of my few days with my family just sitting there, and I didn’t get anything done but X-rays.

<Text>I'm currently sitting in the dental office and waiting for the dentist; my appointment was scheduled for 12:00p.   I arrived at 11:45a and waited until 12:35p when I told the receptionist that I was leaving.  The customer service is terrible and the wait time is even worse!!  This is my first and last time coming to this dentist.  There are very few patients and several employees; yet none are attending to the four patients.  This is the absolute WORST experience.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>most horrible place, the cleaning was horrible and she droped instruments many times, and then was no water to rinse the month, she said because they just cleaned the room.Then they found 3 cavities then i couldnot see in XRay. Looks like they fixing a healthy teeth just to make $. I noticed a lot of customers who are not familiar with dentistry and not sure what doctor is doing. nurse start whisper something to doctor when i asked to see XRays, and then doctor said i dont think you have a cavities . I imagine how many people had a suspicious sevice there, so sad< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
Writing this while sitting in the office. This is a Terrible place. My first time here and I'll never be back. Arrived at 11:45 for a 12pm appointment. No one said anything to me about running late. I would never have known unless I went up and asked why I hadn't been seen yet at 12:17pm. I have to be back to work at 1:45pm. Only THEN did they tell me that they were behind and it would be another HOUR before I'm seen. They told me I could just leave. Uh no. Normal people do not have the luxury to take multiple days off work because you guys are incompetent. I should have been told when I arrived at 11:45. HORRIBLE customer service. No parking. Rude staff. Do yourself a favor and never go here

Update: the dentist was nice and trustworthy. But that's about the only good thing about this place. Found out I have severe gum disease so I scheduled a deep cleaning for the next day (today). Yesterday I was given one price. Then I called my insurance and they told me it should be a different price. Then I go back into western dental in poway today for my appointment and guess what? They tell a completely different price yet again. And guess what? This one is the most expensive they have said yet. Yet again I am sitting waiting to be seen even though they opened at 9 and my appointment was at 9. By the way.. It is 9:42am now. Clearly this is NOT an issue of them running behind from another patient but rather a problem with the location staff. Last thing... It's funny when they seem to have so much free time on their hands that they are texting on their cell phones while I'm waiting. I took a photo for proof but seems I can't add it here.<//review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I have been taking my Mom to many Western Dental locations since last two years, and I find the Western Dental Poway location is the best among all the Western Dental locations. Presently (9/6/17) Dr. Sharma at Poway location has become her dentist, and boy, my Mom is lucky to have her as her dentist. Dr. Sharma is very very caring, very professional yet very compassionate and very good in her work. She is a gem of a person and i feel any body would be fortunate if they get to choose her for their dental needs. She is a very promising dentist, and I have a feeling that she will be one of the top most and recognized dentists in the California very soon. She takes quite a bit time with patients to go over details, does not force any options, and patiently serves.  Hats off to Dr. Sharma!<//review></record>

I hope these employees got paid a good bonus for coming on here writing false positive reviews for this place. 😡😡 Businesses should get in trouble for paying employees to do this. Shameful.

I've been to three separate Western Dentals and have had poor experiences at all of them. I thought since this one was at Poway that maybe they would be a bit more professional. Boy was I wrong. The employees at this place are just as inept as the employees at all the other Western Dentals I've been to. The lady we spoke to over the phone couldn't even make an appointment correctly and my husband gave her his social and everything. When we confronted them about this mistake they lied to us and basically told us that we never made the call in the first place. Even though its in our call records. Western Dentals corporate office is just as useless and unhelpful.

These employees aren't even competent enough to make an appointment over the phone. Then they make up lies to cover for their incompetence. Why would I trust them with my family's dental care? Myself, my husband and children will be seeking dental care elsewhere.</Text>

<username>Danielle Tentschert< /username><date>1489509707562< /date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Writing this while sitting in the office. This is a Terrible place. My first time here and I'll never be back. Arrived at 11:45 for a 12pm appointment. No one said anything to me about running late. I would never have known unless I went up and asked why I hadn't been seen yet at 12:17pm. I have to be back to work at 1:45pm. Only THEN did they tell me that they were behind and it would be another HOUR before I'm seen. They told me I could just leave. Uh no. Normal people do not have the luxury to take multiple days off work because you guys are incompetent. I should have been told when I arrived at 11:45. HORRIBLE customer service. No parking. Rude staff. Do yourself a favor and never go here

Update: the dentist was nice and trustworthy. But that's about the only good thing about this place. Found out I have severe gum disease so I scheduled a deep cleaning for the next day (today). Yesterday I was given one price. Then I called my insurance and they told me it should be a different price. Then I go back into western dental in poway today for my appointment and guess what? They tell a completely different price yet again. And guess what? This one is the most expensive they have said yet. Yet again I am sitting waiting to be seen even though they opened at 9 and my appointment was at 9. By the way.. It is 9:42am now. Clearly this is NOT an issue of them running behind from another patient but rather a problem with the location staff. Last thing... It's funny when they seem to have so much free time on their hands that they are texting on their cell phones while I'm waiting. I took a photo for proof but seems I can't add it here.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1489525281485, 'text': 'Hello Danielle,\n\nWe are sorry to hear that we did not meet your expectations.\nI would like to further discuss your concerns.

<rating>1< /rating><review>Awful staff. First I Was put on hold for 30 min. Called back an was answered quickly I asked why I was on hold for so long no one had an answer. Second experience I made apt through the schedule appt line , showed up to be told that appt must have been scheduled in error as they are at lunch during the time of my appt.
