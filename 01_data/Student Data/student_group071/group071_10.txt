<Date>1611173802895< /Date><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>We had an appointment for a cleaning and check. When we got there, they cleaned and said the units were working.  We never got to talk to the Doctor, Ashley,  as she was busy with another appointment.  I explained to the receptionist that we had waited for 5 months for the appointment and there was a continuous ring in my elderly mother's ear. He told me he wasn't a doctor so he could only clean the units and our appointment didn't include speaking with the doctor.  Unacceptable! I explained to him we have an appointment and ours is as valid as any other appointment.  I told him we would wait as long as it for the Doc to finish the appointment ahead of us. I am sorry they did not allow enough time for our appointment.  In the end, after all of us being flustered, he did the best he could. I was disappointed and did not feel valued.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I'd give 0 or negative star if these are permitted. Given the perspective that I've never given any other places lower than 3* before.
I booked a free hearing test appointment for my mom based on the positive reviews of this place, and Aaron Gabrielson is the hearing test tech.
Before he performed any tests, he was trying to push us for commitment of "treatment" -- either surgery or equipment. I told him that we were there for hearing test, and open to discuss the treatment plan, but we were not going to make any decision on the spot. He raised his voice, and try to push for commitment to sign up treatment before any tests were done. I repeated several times what we were there for, he was louder and louder, and my mom said he could lower his voice. He then said, her ear was OK, didn't need to be tested. Since he has not interest to perform hearing test which was what we went there for, so we agreed to leave. I then asked him to return our personal information which was on the forms we filled in, he refused, and said that we his property, and thread to call police.
I understand business is trying to sell things to make money, but not in this way. He is the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life, and I really don't understand how this place got all the 5 stars from.<//Review>

<Name>Aaron G.</Name><text>Lorie, not sure where to begin in response to this review. I guess I’m surprised that if your experience was that negative, why would you try to book another test with me another two separate times at two different locations? Maybe it was because you seemed more interested in the gift card that day than even a test for your mother? I am not sure where you felt “pressured” to do anything. I asked your Mother directly if she felt that she had a hearing loss which she responded “no” to. Also I asked her if she was interested in even being tested, in which she also responded “no” as well. After that you asked again about the gift card, and potential treatments for hearing loss. I first answered your questions about potential treatments for hearing loss, by this point your mother was already walking out of my office because she was not interested in a test. You seemed to be frustrated by this. Then you asked me for the gift card (again), in which you responded with anger. At that point you demanded your mother’s patient intake form which I said I couldn’t release without patient consent, and because she left I didn’t have that. At that point you grabbed the patient folder off my desk and ran to your car. In my years of service as a Hearing Specialist I have never had an appointment go like this. Apparently it was bewilderedering for all involved. I wish you and your mother the best and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< resp>

<Text>I have been to numerous Audiologists and Hearing Specialists and by far Aaron Gabrielsen is the best I've ever worked with. I didn't want to admit I had a problem but overtime I got sick of missing out on conversations especially in social situations. Aaron was able to help diagnose my hearing loss and educate me on the different hearing aids that would help me. I was able to find one that I could afford and more importantly THAT WORKS!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><time>1582057765084<//time><rate>5<//rate>< user_id>

By far the best health care facility I have EVER been to. The level of care, customer service and knowledge is unmatched. I highly recommend this office to anyone looking for long term hearing care solutions. Shaun and Rachell do a tremendous job making you feel like family and addressing your needs. If I could give a 10 star review I would. They truly are that good.<//review>

I visited Miracle Ear 6 months ago when my wife suggested we have our hearing tested.  (I already knew that my hearing was poor since birth).

Spencer, at the Cupertino office, is very professional and very good at making sure a customers needs are met.  He is a real pleasure to work with.

On my first visit, I was quite amazed at the testing and hearing aid programming process.  Being an electrical engineer familiar with frequency response measurements during school, it was fascinating seeing the programmed response curve being overlaid on the measurement data.  What is truly amazing is how natural the sound is.  I almost forget that I am wearing them sometimes.<//Text>

Before getting into the review itself, I should say I am very pleased with every aspect of Miracle Ear the company and the product, as well as my experience with the staff at the office -- they made the process simple, smooth, and easy, and the hearing aids I got are the best I've ever had. I'm 64 and now after all these years I feel I'm hearing better than when I was a teenager.

No product is perfect, of course; however  these hearing aids are so much better than the product I bought 8 years ago, it's amazing -- they're really opening up new opportunities for having a better social life.

I bought a top-line pair of hearing aids from the Miracle Ear office in Cupertino, CA. Before choosing this company I did a *lot* of research, and I called several local providers to get an appointment. Miracle Ear was the first and only one I went to, because they convinced me in one session that their hearing aid was the right one for me.

I was helped by Aaron Gabrielson. Aaron started by finding out about my needs, and did a free hearing test right there on the spot as part of the first visit. The results were that I was suffering from significant hearing loss, and these results matched the profile I obtained from my audiologist in the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.

Aaron answered all my questions and was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and also very enjoyable to work with. I feel that he and Rachel really care about my needs and work hard to produce exceptional results for me. Over the follow-up visits (see below) I got to know them better and I really like them -- exceptional professionals and warm people.

The great thing about Miracle Ear is that they do not just sell you hearing aids and forget about you. Instead, they pretty much require you to come in for a series of follow up visits that start once you get your hearing aids, and during these visits Aaron fine-tuned the hearing aids to better match what my hearing loss requires. This is a process whereby your ears and brain get "retrained" to process all the new information that your ears hear. Aaron was always polite, respectful and very helpful.

As with everything, there are some negatives as well. The most significant I'll mention is the price. The hearing aids I bought are the most expensive ones I've ever purchased. Very expensive. But once you consider everything I got, the value is exceptional -- I am now hearing much better than I've ever had, since being a teenager, the time my hearing loss started. The technology is really cutting edge and produces exceptional amplification of what you WANT to hear while suppressing background noises. And the follow-up program and periodic tuning, plus the gradual approach taken, is based on recognizing that people need some adjustment time, and most cannot tolerate the huge jump in what they hear all at once. I believe this approach results in much better results.

I'll close by saying that I've been talking the ears off everyone who will listen (and some people that did not want to listen) about getting hearing aids and recommending the Cupertino office. Two thumbs up!</text>

< Review>
This is my first hand experience dealing with Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) - Gregg Olsen, Mike Olsen and Amplifon (“Parent Company”)

***I highly encourage anyone reading this review to NOT DO BUSINESS WITH Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear)***

The evidence in this matter reveals the original Purchase Agreement lacks at a minimum, and in pertinent part - the required signature(s) of the customer, required dates, required accept/decline of Supplemental Warranty, and the required signature(s) of Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) consultant(s)/employee(s). This is not a valid contract.

A refund for the defective hearing aids was requested within the 45 day required timeframe (by law), and Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) refused the return, as well as the refund request. Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) refused the return within the 45 days and stated that we must keep them for 6 months or more and until such time that the device(s) would likely work properly.

We have made every reasonable attempt (in writing and by phone) to resolve this matter directly with Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear), and they simply offered for us to keep the defective hearing aids, sell them on the open market, or "...wait until the health insurance resets and purchase new hearing aids..." from them Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear).

Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) has acted illegally, unethically, and immorally in this case.<//Review>

I can't speak for those who work inside this wonderful and amazing facility! But I've been picking up loads here for 30 years!
The employees that I've had the pleasure of doing business with are absolute professional when it comes to there job and  have become friends with always service with a smile 😃.  They have kept our company busy throughout the Corona virus.

< Review>
4/1/21 arrived at 5pm for my 6pm appointment. I was staged at the dock, doors closed by 5:50pm. It took them until 9:30pm to figure out the order of loading my trailer because it's a 3 stop delivery. Still waiting for paperwork at 11:30pm. It's been almost 7 hours, and they ran out my clock.</Review>

I normally have better luck/service than today so I that is why I give 3 stars. But I had a 12:30pm appointment and arrived at 10:50am. They said short on product but drop in door 14. They did not start loading until 5pm.  Still loading my trailer,,,but now I only have 45 minutes left on my clock.  I’m not happy and who would be?  I will request detention but I would rather have zero detention and be driving!  3 things I hate about trucking.  1) being away from home. 2) sitting at a door waiting to get un/loaded.  3) E-Logs.   So today I get hit by all 3 right now!!  Grrr.<//text>

Burritos are tasty but certainly not what's pictured on the package they are double triple overlapped tortillas with a very small spoonful I mean very small spoonful of stuff inside certainly not what is shown on the picture I would rather pay twice the price and get something that's going to fill me up in the morning they're nice people and have tasty food but like seriously give the people something for their money I guess for a three-year-old they would be fine< /text>

The guy on the shipping office during the day shift has an attitude plus he’s really rude. The people on the later shift was way nicer and got me loaded pretty quick! So the star it’s because of the day shift! Props to the people on the night shift!</review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>TL,DR: Avoid this place if you are a trucker and like to make money.  Staff is okay, place seems severely disorganized.

I normally don't go around leaving negative reviews, but this is one of the most disorganized shipping facilities I've been to. The staff were friendly enough, so it was more of a left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing kind of thing .

I arrived at about 1230 for my 1300 appointment and checked in. Was told I'd have a little wait, so no big deal at first. I also noticed everytime I came in the dock was a cluster of pallets.  Maybe they had some sort of system to it, but I couldn't tell.

I checked back 2 hours later and they seemed to have "misplaced" my load papers with my name/number/info on it .So, after about 5 minutes they were able to finally print out a new sheet and I filled that out.  I was told I still had a 5-6 hour wait. Starting to get rediculous, but I know things get backed up some times .

Fast forward to about 0100 hours (12 hours after having checked in).  The night crew is no on and I check to see what's going on.  Lo and behold, they can't find my paperwork anywhere. So, after 5 more minutes of the guy messing with the computer, we fill out yet another sheet with the same info. This time I'm told there are 7 trucks ahead of me. When I ask how that's so since I've been waiting for so long (and have been watching trucks that arrived way after me get loaded), I'm met with the response of "I wasn't here when you checked in."  Good job answering my question.

So the next morning, after sitting for 20+ hours at this point, I'm pulled off the load and sent elsewhere. As a courtesy, I go in to let the office know I'm leaving.  I got to wait another 5 minutes while they tried to (and finally did) find my paperwork .

Everytime I went in, it seemed a vast majority of the paperwork was in random spots throughout the office.  This place seriously needs to rethink what they are doing.  Had I stayed there, I would've maybe had one driving shift (11 hours max) to drive over 1,000 miles for the delivery.< /Review>< response>

Very cute security gentlemen that looks like Mclovin, very nice guy when you are a nice person(especially to the custodians) and do what you are supposed to do like show lunchbox/ID without pulling some stunt. Funny guy 10/10 would start a conversation and an improv show with him at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in sunset boulevard.<//Text>

<user_id>112606866521349655488< /user_id><text>This review is for Ruiz Foods, who makes El Monterey frozen foods. This is the same review I left on their website.

I just purchased two packages of your products for the first time - bean and cheese burritos and bean/beef/green chili burritos - 8 pack of each one - both packs MILD.

I ate one of each kind today and had the most immediate, severe heartburn I've ever experienced.

I plan to throw the rest of them out and consider this purchase a waste of money and a very unpleasant experience after eating them. You guys lost a customer on their very first purchase of your products.

My recommendation - don't eat El Monterey frozen foods unless you have heartburn meds by your side. I'm not a heartburn sufferer for the most part - I purchased MILD on purpose - and it was a terrible eating experience...<//text><Time>1552512987632<//Time></record>

The loading when you arrive is BS, especially with company empties in the drop line.
I'm not sitting in a loading door for 6-8 hours.
I need sleep at some point, not going to happen in Ruiz dock door.
Hiring more rookie driving companies to ship I noticed. Those guys just sit all day, until they quit.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I like this park. It has a playground, exercise equipment, basketball court, soccer area (blacktop) and lots of grass. My kids enjoyed themselves. We'll definitely be back!< /review>

This is getting to be a really nice park. There has been recent work to upgrade the flower beds, add benches, and lots of new exercise equipment.</text>

Well maintained futsal courts. Also, a nice basketball court. The lawn needs maintenance. Parking is a challenge because of the mixed use of neighborhood and visitor attendance to area.< /Review>

Great neighborhood park, used extensively by the community, but maybe avoid going too deep in after dark.<//Review>

Capitol Park, one of the local parks in the middle of the Latinx community in San Jose. Capitol park is where you find folks playing volleyball after a long day of work, children playing around and running after the palateros/eloteros for some afternoon snacks.
Although the place doesn’t look all that well, it’s the community that keeps it real and worthwhile.
Make sure to pick up after yourself!</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is very beautiful, the worst thing is the piggy people who do not repeat nor the drinkers because they are in the hands of the bathroom, and since there are many drunks, those who woke in the afternoon do not repeat anyone because they put smoking weed before Of the children and young people who come to Capitol Park to buy any type of drug and I don't say it because I sell it, but because I love it, I give drugs to youngsters and youngsters and to all kinds of people

Es muy bonito lo mas malo son las personas cochinas q no repetan ni los bebederos por q asta en los laba manos del baño mean y como son muchos borrachos los q ay por las tardes no repetan a nadie por q se ponen a fumar asta marihuana delante delos niños ay jovenes q bienen a capitol park a comprar cual quier ripo de drogas y no lo digo por q yo venda si no por q lose bisto ben deles drogas a jovencitos y a jovensitas y a todo tipo de personas< /text>

<Text>Loved the store so much! Great atmosphere and clothes, WONDERFUL customer service!!! I’m so glad they have a mask policy to keep their customers safe and well. Kelly was amazingly sweet and kind when I asked her for help, and another girl that was at the door handing out FREE masks to customers who didn’t have any. Definitely will be shopping here again and recommending the store to my family and friends!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Great job keeping your employees, and patrons safe during this pandemic! Keep up the good work, and buy Kelly a few glasses of wine for putting up with these anti-mask morons!

I went to this place and they treated me very nicely. They were kind to me, and they kept the other customers safe including me, when a lady was disrupting the store saying she has a "condition" that doesn't allow her to wear a mask. They treated the situation very calmly and professionally.</Review>

Just saw a video of this store not allowing a "Karen" in because she didn't have a mask...AND this store was kind enough to offer her one!
I'm supporting this store and the community does too!
Good for you to stand up to people who were so inconsiderate of others safety and well being! Your store your rules!<//Review>

Thank you Kelly for protecting your customers and employees by requiring people to wear face masks! I’m so sorry you had to deal with Valerie Taglione and her ignorance. Just like how establishments have the right to refuse service for not wearing a shirt or shoes...you have every right to refuse service for not wearing a mask. The governor has made it a requirement for masks to be worn. Also, that woman is an idiot for thinking you can get monoxide poisoning for wearing one. Wish there was a vaccine for stupidity, but alas, there isn’t!< /text>

Crossroads publicly discriminates against disabled people refusing to let them in without a mask, violating ADA Civil rights. I watched the manager, Kelly Hines, tell a disabled customer that it was the law to wear a mask, and then refused her service when the customer said it was not a law and that she had health issues and can’t wear one. Will never spend my money here again and will be making a complaint with the ADA for ADA violations.< /text>

This is a wonderful store with great customer service. Any bad reviews would be false reports from an angry 'Karen' who didn't want to wear a face mask. She gets 0 stars for being and self-absorbed egotist.<//Review>

<Review>Thank god for employees like Kelley who enforce the rule of wearing masks inside the store. Wearing a mask is the absolute least people can do to protect others and I have been happy to see this store follows common sense even in the face of unreasonable and cursing customers, all while keeping their cool.<//Review>< Name>

This place is interesting and has a lot of good stuff but at the same time hard to get 5 stars when I feel some prices are well.. you be the judge. Very nice area lots of stuff to do in the shopping center and run around and enjoy yourself. Of course right down the street is the beach about a mile away.</text>

Needed shoes and a shirt so I could go motorcycling.  Its a huge store with everything you can imagine. This was the second time here for me. My bf brought me here a few weeks ago.. and in a pinch, he brought me back..and told me i always need shoes! I was out the door under 60 bucks..and the shoes were perfect.</text>

<review>There's a pretty big selection of a wide variety of styles here, and it is always clean and usually fairly well organized. Prices are great. The staff are friendly and happy to help if asked, but not in your face. I will say, however, that this is not the place to go if you are bigger than a size Large (hence the deduction of 1 star). They have a HUGE selection in XS and S, and a good selection in M and L, but I only saw a couple of items in XL.

I started shopping here when I was 19 and unfortunately, I am either aging or of their core demographic (I'm 31 now), or I am just really not into the current trends of crop tops, off the shoulder tops, and distressed tees (the first 2 of which are not functional for the mother of an active toddler). If those are your bag, though, check them out! And, if you read this review next season, they will have whatever is on-trend then.<//review>< Pics>

I hardly ever leave reviews - but this place sure deserved my review. Honestly so baffled by my experience here.

I walked in with 5 full bags of shoes and clothes to sell. All INCREDIBLE quality and brands like LuluLemon, Urban Outfitters, Zara, Free People, etc.

After waiting for 20 minutes for them to even call me up to get my clothes from me, I waited another 20 minutes for them to look through the clothes.

After almost an hour, one of the employees calls my name to let me know what items they were able to take. That being, 2 ITEMS. I was shocked and politely asked for reasoning, the reason being “these brands don’t sell that well for us.” Funny enough, the rest appeared untouched and only offered to take two items that were at the very top of the stack.

SHOCKED. And to top off my horrible experience, one of the two items was a gorgeous and close-to-new Lululemon jacket - he offered 10$ for it.

So, all in all, I would never recommend this place to absolutely anyone.

I should add: I’ve sold here once before a few months ago and they took the majority of my items for a decent cash back. Telling me “I have great items”. Then coming back to this - such a disappointing company.</Text>

Too bad the people here don't know their stuff.  I went in with 18 brand new kid Cudi T-shirts designed by Virgil Abloh in various sizes.  Market value for these shirts are $250-$300 since my shirts weren't packaged I was willing to settle for $80 a shirt, so you can imagine how I felt when I was low balled at $15 a shirt.<//text>

They are always nice to me, but I would definitely rate their overall service , garbage. Way too much employee talk behind the counters instead of working more efficiently right in front of customers waiting to be served promptly. Very unprofessional. I’ve had much better service at Plato’s Closet where 16 year olds work. They do tend to pay more- when they decide to very rarely buy an item from you.</text>

This is my favorite Crossroads location in Orange County. Most of their LA locations are great too, expect for the Studio City one. The Irvine Crossroads has a poor selection, their store is small, and mostly has fast fashion pieces that you could easily find at the mall already.
Anyway, this location is fabulous. It's their biggest location in both LA and OC. They have a fun staff, huge selection of various styles and trends for both men and women, and they have plenty of dressing rooms so there's never a wait.<//Review>

This review is in regards to selling clothes at Crossroads.  I usually give my clothes to non profit thrift stores, however I am doing a very large closet purge and was hoping to get a little money to help replenish what I was getting rid of.  My clothes were in really good condition and a variety of seasons.  I took in 2 large bags and left them so I wouldn't have to wait for ever...first mistake.  When I came back they informed me that they were in this "wierd in between stage" where they weren't taking anymore winter clothes but weren't taking summer yet so they opted out of taking any of my pieces.  Um, then what the heck is left?  Anyway, when I got home and looked in the bags, it was clear they hadn't even gone through them AT ALL!  Everything that was on top was still there, and there were several pairs of jeans only worn 2-3 times still on the bottom.  If you can't take any of my stuff, fine, but don't lie to me as if you bothered to look through the clothes.  I agree with other reviews that unless it's designer or super brand name, they won't even bother!  What a sham!<//Text>

My favorite crossroads trading, and overall shop. Large store with plenty of causal to night outfits, shoes, purses, etc. Parking lot shared but possible to find a spot. Prices range from $15-$25 of brand names. Nicest staff! -- for selling and buying experience.<//text>

Hi how can I get a hold of the owner or supervisor of the store? I had a really unpleasant situation with the store manager and i would like to address that with her superiors. I came in on Saturday morning when the store open, I was their with my mother, sister and my niece. When we came in my little niece which is 1 years old begin to cry and the store manager comes towards us very aggressive saying "im sorry guys I have kids of my own but if the little girl keeps being disruptive im going to have to ask you guys to leave" at that moment we were shocked by the way she behaved towards us. So my sister says nothing an decided to go back to the car with my niece, and for a moment I thought "Why does my sister have to leave when we've done nothing wrong just becuase a store manager dislikes noise or kid's in general. So I go outside and get my sister back in the store and I go talk to the store manager asking her to talk to a supervisor and she says no im the store manager, I said if you don't want any kid's making noise maybe there's should be a sign in the front door saying NO KIDS ALLOWED, and she adds
You could just have gone outside and told the little girl to keep quiet and I was even more shocked at her words I said "really im going to tell a 1 year old to keep quiet becuase the store manager doesn't want any noise" like a 1 year old is going to understand! She replies "im going to have to ask you guys to leave" and I say im sorry but why do I have to leave when im just asking to speak to a supervisor. If the supervisor or store owner is looking at this comment I would really appreciate if you can please have a word with this store manager she is a blond lady with both arms covered in tattoos she open the doors to the store Saturday 11/18/17. If someone is going to be store manager I would think they would be polite and respectful to their clients thank you!< /review>

<Review>Just because I felt like they didn't want me there. The buyer, who was looking at the clothes I brought,  was talking to other employees the whole time behind the counter when I was literally in front of her. It's like she just wants you to go away.< /Review>< Pictures>

I used to like this place and used to walk out with a bunch of gems but now they don't seem to to buy as many clothes and the options seem more generic now not the friendliest Place either<//review>

Yo.....man in charge there "knee"
forgive me for not knowing proper spelling, went out of his way to accommodate us and make us feel  welcomed. His suggestion on a drink that complimented the meal was on point. Pho was hitn.  Wish he was there more often as POP encounters can make or break a restaurant and it's not the same when he's not there.</text>

I order pho earlier this evening from this place, and the broth/soup was literally smelling like feet! I paid for a large bowl and received what I assumed was an EXTRA SMALL. This place’s a mess! Take your business elsewhere. You’ll thank me later!</text>

The Service: Efficient.

The Drinks: Price is reasonable with the size. Not overly sweet. Boba is soft and fresh.

The Parking: Plaza parking lot.<//Text>

<Text>This place is a hidden Gem in the Torrance Area! We always get out of our workouts late and look for places open later on a Friday night.

Not only do they have convenient hours, but heir food is so tasty, fresh and super affordable!!

I love their chicken Pho bowl and their Shrimp tempura appetizer plate!! Their food is wholesome, light and their cooking has a home real home made feel and taste too.

Did I mention they have smoothies too!!

Try their watermelon juice! Refreshing and sweet!!

I wish their chairs and tables were not wobbly, that is the only complaint I have.

But honestly their vibe, atmosphere and location is super friendly and it feels like a family business. Something that one can appreciate amidst all the franchises restaurants puts there.

So if you want light and healthy with a zest and a good taste, give them a try!!<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2b561761fc3c9:0x6d1774e032578ded< /GmapID>< userid>

So many other places have decided to make changes to fit the taste buds of other, example: adding horchata flavors instead of keeping taro, red bean and so on. I hope the revenue keeps pouring in so this place will continue to flourish.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Selection is good, prices are good, food is better than good, but there is no friendly service or even a smile.  I felt like we were imposing on them by stopping there to eat.  They were almost hostile in their demeanor.  Yes, I went there to eat, but a smile or a welcome goes a long way in reassuring me that they care and are using that care in the preparation of my food.  Not going back.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Came here for lunch during work. Service is quick, but that's about it. I got the combination pho. The broth was very watery and hardly had any taste. I've visited allot of pho places and the broth here was the worst I've had. I added a ton of sriracha to bring some light to the taste, but it ended up tasting like spicy hot toilet water. The combination of meats had a bubblegum texture to them which made the experience worse. The price was cheap, so I guess that is a direct reflection of the quality.<//Text><name>Jon Tacbas<//name><Time>1572850617571< /Time>< pics>

Great, Friendly atmosphere! !  I love the late hours, you can grab a bite to eat and be satisfied, especially when you don't know what to eat. Save your Gas $$ and come straight on over. Great prices, very reasonable. No crazy crowds here, all ages dine here.< /review>

<text>It's a pretty neat place. I've passed it for years and only thought of it as another tapioco/ boba place. If you go inside and look at their menu, you'll actually find out that they have a ton of food. Their pho is not half bad, I eat it regularly if I'm in the area. I do, however,  think their smoothies are waaay too sweet<//text><time>1545369510155< /time>< response>

<Text>Good spot to have Boba. Very traditional Vietnamese restaurant.  I recommend the Vietnamese bread. The popcorn chicken is terrible. They give you crumbs right off the bat. You need tweezers to pick them up. Not worth it. Terrible proportions.< /Text>< pictures>

When I ordered their seafood pancake, the portion was amazing. They put a lot of squid and shrimp, which were very delicious, and it was definitely worth the price. I shared it aith two of my friends, and we couldn't finish it. I also ordered a bibimbap, and that was also so great. If you order it, make sure you add the sauce! Also, the rice gets hard at the bottom, which is my favorite part, because the rice gets really crunchy. Their service was nice, so I strongly recommend this place.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>So disappointed. Terrible service. Went for bobas on a good recommendation looking for a place to be our goto. Initially the order was wrong. Politely informed them, but when they remade it, the cold drink was warm and they only partially filled the cup. I got the impression that they were bothered that I had informed them the order was wrong.<//text>< pictures>

I used to enjoy coming here.  Nowadays we have so many boba tea shops to choose from. Tapioca express definitely can not keep up as far as quality boba and milk tea. Sorry guys its pretty shitty. I only come here for the popcorn chicken.<//review>

<review>The cold drinks and smoothies are actually very good here and the prices are very reasonable, my order is usually ready within couple of minutes. Unlike other boba shop in the area who are more expensive and wait time could be 10-15 minute.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Good place for some pho and boba. The posted hours are a bit deceiving though. They are indeed open until 11pm but you can't get anything to eat a half hour before that, it's boba only. Word to the wise, bring your own napkins because you aren't getting any here. Also if you get thirsty you better be wearing a camelback because you guessed it, you ain't getting any water.<//Text>< time>

The food has great flavor and it is super casual. You order your food at the counter, they give you a number that is taped on a silver paper weight (not fancy), and they bring food out to you.
The customer service is always attentive.
I love the pho broth becuase it is fatty but not too much like Ive had at other places.
The fried rice has great flavor!!
I love the taste of the boba and the smoothie flavors are so sweet.
I come here often and have brought many friends who now frequent here.< /Text>

Cheap and quick pho.  Fascilities are a bit dingy though.  I don't recommend the boba or any of the drinks here, just go to Yami's a few stores down.</Review>

this is a "Tapioca Express"? Why is their outdoor sign not consistent with their overall branding? It looks like a regular Tapioca tea shop.< /Review>

The employees are super nice here and dealt with my indecisiveness. I had my super anxious pup with me and they gained his trust easily- which isn't my dog's norm. 10/10 recommend strongly.<//text>

First time at this location and was very pleased. Clean store and friendly staff. I had 2 coupons that weren't scanning but they were good about putting it in manually and still smiling about it.<//review>

<Review>Greeted right away by staff, & he helped me locate what I was looking for immediately. He let me know there was a buy 2 get one free for my product. Also, the employee scanned the barcode on my phone so I could use my Naylabone coupon. I donated $5 (my way of giving back from my dogs since they were all Pound Puppies), & he let me put all three pet names on the donation tag. Great service, quick visit, & friendly workers 👍< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< name>

Since having a cat adopt me last fall, I have been in this PetCo numerous times for a variety of food, toys, and furniture.  Every single time, the staff has been friendly and helpful.  Although the store is smaller than some pet stores I've been to, I almost always find what I need.</Review>

Other than that, it was ok. Lemon chicken salad was alright, not enough protein. Don't think I would order again from there, over safety concerns.</review>< Pictures>

<review>It probably could of been better but the big lady seemed upset when she was making my sandwich she just through my bread cause I didn't want it toasted too much mustard not enough meat . Chicken noodle soup was good but it was only three spoonful of bites for a large and the rest chicken broth smh . She also was coughing while making it . First time bad experience #NeverAgain!</review>< pictures>

<Text>SCAM ALERT:
This is a scam clinic run by Vasili Razhnou. This FRAUDSTER doesn't pay their service providers. Beware of these SCAMMERS!

You think using proxy companies will make anyone to believe you?

This FRAUDSTER is claiming he has never worked with us...Can you explain about the attached photo??

Google should be delisting you for carrying-out a SCAM in the name of a company. You should be ashamed of stealing from people that work for you!</Text>< Date>

You can also buy these cards from harborside , they charge you $39 for the card and sometimes credit that $39 for purchase from a store !

Online Appointments? Yes!
Easy Access via public transport? Yes!
Nice, clean office? Yup!
Friendly staff? Oh YEAH!
Helpful, friendly doctor? Yes, yes, yes!
Dr. D is such a lovely man. He has done a lot of research on available products and gave me a shopping list of medicines to try.
Extra benefit: It's Tops Coffee Shop is just down the street. Celebrate your new card with a bacon waffle? Yes, indeed.< /text>

<Review>I have been to MMJ Doctors a couple of times now and I have been really impressed. The first time I came in for a renewal. They were fast efficient,  and all very nice. The second time I had to replace a lost ID card. The showed me the same friendly service that brought me back in the first place. I will be coming here for all my renewal ID card needs.< /Review>< pics>

My experience at MMJ Doctor was very good. The secretary and assistants were very easy to communicate with and talk to. The whole thing took about 20 minutes which was great so I wasn't spending hours in the doctors office. Very pleased and will definitely come back to renew!< /Review>

I highly recommend using MMJ. They are a great place with excellent rates and customer service. Very understanding with clear communication and cater to your needs. They are the best and cheapest place in town, I wouldn't go anywhere else. They also give discounts to disabled, veterans, etc. Which is super awesome! (me not being one)</Text>

I also liked that they had gathered a list of all the strains currently on the local dispensaries' menus, so he could reference and recommend ones that are readily available.

<text>MMJ Doctor is great! In fact, so is the whole experience! The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. The wait is not long at all and the professional doctor takes time with his patients to explain information that you might not have known regardless how long you have been a medical marijuana user. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</text>< pictures>

I had been hesitant about getting my card for many years, first because I was anxious about speaking to a doctor and second because I was not able to invest too much money. However, speaking with the doctor at MMJ Doctor was really a good experience. He was respectful and listened to my concerns. This office has a good front desk staff as well, who helped me get my card and finalize all paperwork. In the end the price I payed here was worth it for the service I received, and in comparison to other clinics, this was a fraction of the cost. All in all, 5 stars, would recommend.<//Text>

Fast service and very simple process--made it easy to get the card.  Doctor was scrutinizing and informative, staff was helpful, and the price can't be beat.  It's easy to see why this is the best reviewed mm doctor in SF!< /review>

My initial visit to see the Doctor to get my prescription/recommendation I was very pleased with these things in the order I took notice of them.

1st the lobby and office in its entirety was clean and well maintained with a pleasant scent, didn't make you feel like you where in a doctors office.

2nd the staff was amazing and always are. I have returned on three occasions and each time I walk out in a more pleasant mood simply because the staff knows how to be nice, friendly and courteous.

3rd the speediness of the whole process. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.

There are many benefits to choosing this as your medical marijuana doctor, my favorite has to be the simple and easy 24/7 verification process. Makes life so much more simple when registering at a dispensary for the first time. I will continue to go here for years to come.</Text>

Walked into this place waited 30 minutes and then the doctor had to take an emergency call. Waited another 15 minutes finally left. Made an appointment for 2 PM today to return and apparently 2 PM means 230 minimum so left again. Don't bother trying this place. Plenty of other places close by< /review>

MMJDoctor is the best place to go to renew your cannabis card or get a new one.  I recently renewed my card and they couldn't have been more helpful, they provided a super quick renewal process and they provided me with several coupons on free product at nearby cannabis clubs!  They worked with me to find the most affordable option while offering sound advice on product selection.  Treat yourself right and visit MMJDoctor today to get the get your new cannabis card or renew your current card.   You wont be disappointed you have my word on it.</Review>

This was the first Cannabis related doctor I had ever visited. The entire experience was professional, warm, and even fun. The staff is kind and helpful. The doctor I saw was knowledgable and actually knew a lot about my rare arthritis (Ankylosing Spondylitis), so she was able to recommend great products and gave me general health advice.

The experience was so good that I chose not to use cheap services like Eaze MD for future renewals. Go see a doctor here instead. 5/5.< /review>

<name>Kassie Bowman<//name><Review>Air Plus was great from start to finish, and every single person we interacted with was professional and easy to work with. The quoting process with Kevin was smooth and competitive, and the installation went well. We got another quote from another company that came in a little lower, but we were much more comfortable with the professionalism Kevin showed. Well, Kevin ended up matching the quote, making it an easy decision.

After scheduling the initial install, I had to reschedule due to some things that came up on our end. When I called, the person I spoke with (I think it was Kim) was understanding and made it easy to adjust the dates without any hassles at all.

The whole installation crew, including Eric, Osvaldo, and Andrew (and anyone else I may have missed!), were knowledgeable, efficient, and professional. They checked in to make sure we were happy with the placement of equipment and were proactive in giving us a heads up about any loud noise or strange odors.

We are very happy with the end result and highly recommend the entire team!< /Review><Rating>5</Rating><userid>111163635597738502783<//userid><gmap_id>0x80dc0073d6162f0d:0xf7bdf17f7a071050< /gmap_id><Time>1624652267391<//Time></record></dataset><record>

The Air Plus Heating & Cooling team did an excellent job at installing an entirely new Trane HVAC system for our home. They arrived exactly on time, were very professional,  and kept us informed on the progress of the work throughout the day. Overall it was a very nice experience and definitely recommend their services.</Review>

Hire them! Seriously, the best contractors I've ever hired.
Median pricing, on time, and communicative. I ended up having a very long approval process for a new electrical box with SDGE, but as soon as it was in Air Plus was there installing my new AC system. They were professional, super clean, and the owner was on site making sure I had the best set up. After everything was installed, they spent at least 90 minutes warming and cooling my house, confirming my system was working correctly. Then, someone stayed after to make sure my thermostat was set correctly. Amazing service, I'd recommend them to everyone.<//Review>

We were impressed with how informative they were.

Eric, Andrew and Ozzy installed the system. These guys were prompt, courteous and professional.  Price is very reasonable compared to 2 other estimates I received. Whatever the sales rep recommendations for improvements and effeciency were delivered. They left the place clean. I highly recommend Air Plus. I found them through referral from a happy customer friend.< /text>

Air plus was great! I had trouble finding a place to work on my mini split system if they didn't install it,  but air plus was very courteous.  They researched the issue before coming and unlike other companies they knew how to handle it. The technician Andrew was on time, knowledgeable,  and fixed the problem.

This company was top notch. It was easy to contact the company and schedule a maintenance appointment. The serviceman provided a heads up on arrival time and arrived on time. He immediately got to work, figured out the issues, purchased and installed a non operable part that prevented my home from properly cooling in under three hours. The company takes several forms of payment and I received detailed invoice and receipt via email immediately after payment. Super happy.< /review>

<Text>I appreciated the text notification system that helped me plan my day by providing a 2-hour arrival window with subsequent arrival updates. The HVAC technician, Ralph, arrived on time and immediately made me feel like a valued customer. He spent a fair amount of time checking all our Air Plus equipment both inside and outside our house and shared a clear and comprehensive summary of what he was checking and that happily everything was in good operating condition. Ralph also assisted me with adjusting the fan setting on my thermostat to "continuous" which eliminated my need to reset the timer every 12 hours. A very positive experience both in terms of Ralph's knowledge and quality customer care. Thank you!!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

We had an issue with condensation dripping out of a valve to our outside wall. Eric arrived and went straight to work. He said he thought it may be  overflow, which it was. The ac pipe that linked to our plumbing was blocked. Eric managed to unblock the pipe and stop the condensation dripping through the valve at our side wall. He was very professional and had all the safety protocols in place. We have been with this company for nearly 10 years. They have always given amazing customer service on the phone and in person. Thank you Eric for wonderful customer service and professionalism.< /Review>

Air Plus did an outstanding job on my gas wall furnace. Andrew and Eric were on time and handled a difficult installation in only a couple of hours. Their communication with me was professional and timely. I would highly recommend working with Air Plus!</text>

I contacted Air Plus back in late June for a diagnostic on my AC unit that I needed to replace. I was quoted a very reasonable price and decided to go forward with the installation. It took another month for my HOA to approve the install, however I was able to quickly schedule an appointment w/ Air Plus once I got the green light. I am very pleased with the work they performed. They installed a new Goodman Air handle and heat pump which is significantly quieter than the previous AC/heater unit I had, and replaced all my vents so the new vents would be open facing forward. I even got a new nest thermostat which they took the time to explain how to use. Kevin was a pleasure to work with and extremely professional, prompt, and thorough in his response to my questions. Ralph, Andrew and the rest of the team were great and respectful, and they made sure to vacuum any and all drywall/messes left behind. I would definitely recommend their services! I also plan to continue with the yearly maintenance with them. The pups and I are very grateful for the cool air. Thank you!<//text>

Air Plus installed my furnace & A/C units. Since installation I have had an annual check up for both. The company is responsive, honest and reasonable. For the last two years, inspections have been done by one of their technicians named Ralph. He is very prompt, very polite, very professional. I will recommend Air Plus to anyone willing to listen! 😊< /text>

I worked hard selecting Air Plus and as in all things, hard work pays off.  1.  Consumer Reports bottom line: Trane best overall
2.  Trane lists multiple options in San Diego
3.  I also considered original HVAC installer and the installer that did my father's house
4.  After comparing all four candidate companies for price, system expertise, availability for an estimate & install, online reviews, company history, in home estimate experience, company size and most importantly, the kindness of all the people I interacted on the phone and in person, we chose Air Plus.
5.  Owner Jim Crawford, former Marine, was on scene both for estimate technical consultation and the install.  A good man.
6.  Day of install, like every interaction, began with a text heads up saying who was on their way with their name and picture.
7.  All Air Plus people were 100% COVID compliant.
8.  Hard to find home, hard to park, still, on time.
9.  Two, then Three Veterans arrived 0730 on a long weekend friday, well dressed, polite and went to work.
10.  Not only was I allowed to watch any part of the removal and install, I was made to feel like my questions were not stupid and they were proud of their work.
11.  They finished early, the job was beautiful.
12.  The following week when the State environmental inspector came he confirmed the quality of the job but stated as soon as he saw the Air Plus sticker, he knew the inspection would be fast and easy.  All the readings exceeded in a good way what they were supposed to be.
Bottom line, Five Stars in every way.<//text>

<text>This review is long overdue. I had Air Plus install ductless AC units in my condo two years ago.  My condo president recommended Air Plus since she had used them to install her units.  Installation was fraught with issues.  First, they made plans to install the condenser on the ground floor only to scramble and change it to the roof when they learned the condo unit was on the 3rd floor.  Then there were multiple delays getting installers with multiple excuses given.  Then when they did finally arrive to do the installation, they underestimated the time it would take.  They were there until midnight and still not done.  They knew they were in the wrong and at least offered a 3% discount.

Fast forward two years later when I called them when one of the unit was making noises.  Of course we called on the last day of the labor warranty to have a technician unable to replicate the problem.  Two weeks later, reporting the same problem but outside of warranty so $149 service call (not applied to work) to discover the issue was a clogged drain.  A more diligent technician would have taken the time to diagnose this correct the first time.  So done.  Stay away!</text><pics>None< /pics>< Date>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>The heating function is poor, takes too long to heat up, throws cold air intermittently. The tech arrived promptly and seemed competent. He found one problem, but wasn’t sure if that would fix it. He said it would be expensive to repair. I’m waiting for a quote.
Update: I received the quote for replacing the motor and controller
assembly at for $1,088 for labor since the parts were unders warrnty. I questioned it because it seemed strange that the motor would fail after only 4 years, but decided to go ahead with the repiar. The same
technician came back and stated that he made an error and the motor was OK after all. I asked him if he hd been to New Jerssey which is appearantly the place Fujitsu does trainig and he said "not yet." He also stated that he was the best technician for this appliance on staff at Air Plus. He spent some time here and experienced the malfunction of the unit which is that it doesn't heat after about 20 minutes and never reaches the set temperature. After leaving and getting in touch with the folks in Jersey, he said maybe it's the fan. At my request he came back to test the fan and declrared that it was fine. So  i'm back at square one. He gets A for effort, but Air Plus gets an over all F. They should not advertise that they can repair Fujitsu until they have someone who is trained.</Text>< pics>

Can’t compliment this company enough!!! They were extremely professional, courteous, kind and knowledgeable of their service. They were on time and were even able to do the installation in one day instead of two. What really impressed me was that the owner, Jim, was on site throughout the process to make sure all was being done to his liking. I am very pleased with the excellent service from Air Plus!< /Text>

<Text>I felt our A/C needed a maintenance check so
Andrew Booth was our technician on May 7, 2020.
He was right on time, and very efficient.
Explained questions in a pleasant manner.  A very qualified technician!
We are very happy with Air Plus!  Just superior
in every step of the installation process when our
A/C was installed in 2014, resulting in no problems ever!!
Thank you everyone at Air Plus!

I had a few that just wanted to replace all the equipment. Their bids were the lowest; however they clearly just wanted my business, sell me a new unit and charge me for labor. I almost went with them because I didn't know any better. Until Kevin with Air Plus arrived and took the time to truly understand my problem. Even before my AC stopped working I had always had a big problem with my upstairs not getting any air. My existing A/C was also very loud (turn the TV up every time it came on loud).  Kevin did a complete inspection of the house including peeking in the attic. I had wondered how the others had diagnosed my problem without even looking at my ducting. Kevin came up with a plan which entailed replacing the existing, poorly designed ducting (designed for heat). Kevin explained the different types of air conditioning units available without trying to steer me in any one direction. He answered all the questions I had so that I could understand and pick what was best for my home. Kevin spoke very highly of the company owner Jim and mentioned that he is an air flow expert and goes to every job. This was definitely an unexpected expense and a big investment. Because of this I was hesitant and had a lot of questions. Kevin and Jim both came out to my home a few days later to answer more of my questions. One week later I have a completely new system, new ducting, new modern registers and the airflow is amazing. For the first time in 8 years I can actually feel the a/c in my master bedroom upstairs. My home has an overall cool feeling now. My old system used to blow like a hurricane but only cooled certain areas downstairs. I no longer have to turn the TV up when the AC kicks on. I also had a big name company come out. They were great as well but wanted to do way more which would cost way more.  I trusted that the less involved plan Air Plus came up with would suffice and it did. I'm a happy customer!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Ralph, Andrew, Eric arrived on time this morning to change out my air conditioning Unit.  They did a great job.  They were very meticulous and even made sure to vacuum and clean up afterwards.  The new AC is working very well.
I will definitely refer Air Plus to anyone who asks about our unit or is having problems with theirs.

Great experience with Air Plus Heating & Cooling. We had received a few price quotes from other companies but were given a very competitively priced quote for sealing of air ducts in our attic and Kevin and his team were very responsive, had wonderful customer service, and completed the job quickly for us. We have great improvement in air flow in our house now- highly recommend!<//review>

Air Plus service was great from start to finish. I needed a technician to take a look at my rental property and Amanda was very helpful and set me up with an appointment for me. They have great customer service. Will continue to call them for any of my HVAC needs.<//text>

Air Plus installed my system back in 2007, when I called in I spoke to Michelle, though she is new to the company and she did have to go over some of the details with the Office Manager Amanda, overall they both were quick to get me on the schedule to send a technician out. The technician came out, diagnosed the problem and my system was up and running in no time. Will continue to recommend Air Plus to my friends and family.<//text>

Started having issue with my furnace several weeks ago. It was an intermittent problem and hard to isolate. I was not ready to give up on the problem and neither AirPlus. After several visits, the problem was finally solved. Throughout past several weeks, I spent considerable time talking to Jim, Andrew, Amanda, and Kim. They all are very customer focused and pleasant to work with. They all get 5 stars for a JOB WELL DONE.<//review>

I had a very pleasant experience with Air Plus Heating & Cooling. Jim came out and diagnosed the problem and had his office manager Amanda order the part. She kept us in the loop with the eta on when the part would arrive and we were back on the schedule in no time. She made the whole experience very easy and not stressful given we were out a/c during the hot spill in SD. If you need any HVAC services call Air Plus!< /Review>

I would give Air Plus Heating 5 stars.  Jim was great to work with.  There was no sales pressure and he came across very professional and knowledgeable in the initial meeting.  The installation went very smoothly.  Both Jim and Sean should be commended on the care they took every step of the way.  Thanks to your whole team, we love our new furnace and would recommend you to anyone.</review>

Can't say enough great things about Air Plus! Professional and courteous every step of the way. Always on time. The crew, Daryl, Darrick, Ralph and Andrew were absolutely amazing! I've never seen such hard workers! It was a very hot two days, a lot of which they had to be in my attic and they did so with great dedication to their trade. Always polite and professional and provided excellent cleanup service after each day of work. Choose this company for all your furnace and AC needs.< /Text>

<text>These guys were very efficient. Jim, Dorian and Ralph came for an A.C. maintenance visit, with duct updating and blown in attic insulation. Another company estimate (from the guys we all see on TV) recommended I redo everything, that my ducting all had to go, for multiple thousands of dollars. I found Jim to be honest and reasonable in his estimate, with determining the ducting itself was newer, no need to replace it, but airflow and duct connections could  be redone. These guys were in and out within 4 hours. I work from home, and there was little noise nor disruption to my day.<//text>< Resp>

Air Plus is one of the top HVAC Companies I have worked with yet. They are all professional and knowledgeable people. Amanda was helpful with setting up the appointment and providing all the answers to my questions. The tech's came completed the service and everything is working great.

<text>My neighbor recommended them.  Their technicians were thorough and honest.  They showed me each step of their work.  I had previously used Anderson company to do this work,  whose technicians wanted to add extra items for no benefit at triple the cost. so,  I appreciated these guys with  Air Plus who did their job well and didn't try to con me into more unnecessary items.</text>< Date>

Great service, I reached out via Yelp and received help right away from Amanda, after a few emails back and forth was able to get on the schedule and have the repairs taken care of. Amanda was very helpful and so was Andrew at time of service. Would definitely recommend to others.- Mr Fields.</review>

<Text>Needed a central air condition installed ASAP. Kim was able to schedule an estimate. Jim gave a reasonable price and I did not hesitate to go with their company. They have excellent customer service and they quickly respond to any questions or concerns you have. The day of the installment, they were on time and very respectful. I would definitely recommend them to our friends and family.<//Text><user_id>105248866786093162578< /user_id>< pictures>

Air Plus Heating and Cooling were very helpful. Andrew came out to service my system and got it back up and running right away. Not only did he clearly explain what was wrong with the system, he walked me through some basic troubleshooting steps and a recommended filter maintenance schedule.< /Review>

We recently moved and wanted to replace our 30 year old heater and the air as well. Many of our neighbors said they used Air Plus and gave glowing reviews. We have to agree. Jim, Kim and Rhonda guided us through the process and they were wonderful. Top notch from beginning to end.</review>

<text>Mark came and diagnosed the problem with my compressor which stopped running. There was a loose connection on the circuit board and that the freon needs ltopping of just 2 lbs.

My unit is about 30 years old, and Mark told me that the unit (Day & Night) is still in good working condition, and there is no need for repair.

We will have a cool A/C and be ready for the summer days.

The honestly of this company is what I value the most. The technician could have said that I need a new compressor which is believable considering the age of the unit or they could say that the freon is completely empty.  You can be sure that they only replace (if any) the parts IF it needs replacing and not scaring customers for unnecessary expenses.

BTW, Mark is very professional in his work, friendly and has great personality.

Air Plus should get higher than a 5 star rating. Thanks Mark and Kim.

A very happy customer.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>I cant say enough good things about Air Plus heating and Air. They recently installed a ductless multi zone unit in my place in Mission Beach. Jim was very thorough in evaluating what I was looking to achieve and really spent the time doing a thorough walk through on the initial consultation. This in addition to his knowledge and overall friendly nature is really what convinced me they were the right company for the job. The installation and setup was top notch and now keeps my second story older unit, with minimal insulation very cool even with the windows open

I would recommend Air Plus for any heating & cooling needs as this company displays the upmost professionalism, which is very important to me when i am opening up my home to someone.

Best service ever in my 11 years residing in San Diego
A great job installing and cleaning up after.
Very friendly people.
Just the best experience you could imagine.

Thank you Air Plus for finishing the air conditioner installation the same day,
and all the great follow up to make sure  my walls were clean and my carpet was  clean also.

<Text>Cleaned dryer vent and serviced our furnace. There were a couple of problems with the service but once we emailed and called they promptly came out to fix it without a hassle. Everyone makes mistakes now and then, it's a matter of how a company responds and whether they stand behind their work. Air Plus gets full credit for doing so.<//Text>< time>

<Time>1403487232598</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Jim and his crew at Air Plus Heating & Cooling are simply the best.  We've completely upgraded our home and used our fair share of contractors and professionals.  The particular HVAC duct replacement job that Air Plus worked on was turned away by two prior HVAC contractors because they said our attic was too small to perform the job.  One even suggested removing our ceiling for the duct replacement!  Jim and his crew didn't hesitate to perform the replacement.  They were quick, clean, and efficient.  I had them install insulation as well - which they did a beautiful job on.  I'd refer my family and friends to Air Plus without hesitation.< /review>< Pics>

<user>107462737351847934696< /user><Text>Update:
1/14/2020. Today Air Plus came to my home to install insulation in my attic. After I had my house remodeled I lost some of my installation. Eric and Ralph showed up today and promptly covered my floors and my wall to protect them from the long hose that they used to blow in the insulation. They did it quickly and effortlessly. When finished they cleaned everything and left my house the way they found it. Perhaps even cleaner!  I am very pleased with Air Plus and they were services. Eric and Ralph did a great job. Ralph regularly services my Air filtration system.  And he’s always very polite and gets the job done. He especially loves my dog Dusty.

suffer from allergies and asthma.  Kim told me about the air filtration offered by trane that works alongside my furnace.  My system is now one year old and I have noticed a real difference in my allergies a asthma.  I am very pleased with the quietness of the Trane furnace.  I would not hesitate to recommend this system to anyone.  Cuts down on the dust too!</Text>< Resp>

We replaced our current HVAC system which was under performing with a three zoned Trane system, new duct work, and Trane CleanEffects – an air filtration system. The system is powerful, quiet and easy to use – we can even control the various zones using our Smart phones and the Nexia app.

In the process of choosing AirPlus Heating and Cooling, we researched our needs and received five proposals. In the end, the most logical and best solution was provided by AirPlus. The team members who installed the project were knowledgable, friendly, and hard working.  Rhonda was on top of all administrative matters and was a pleasure to work with.

Jim and his team went the extra mile on many occasions. We would strongly recommend them to anyone looking for an HVAC system.</review>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Air Plus Heating, Cooling, & Solar was the third of three bids I solicited to replace the c. 1980s furnace in our rental property.  Rhonda Mayes, the scheduling coordinator (my description) was very quick about setting a convenient meet with Danny (to do the initial survey so as to create the materials list). As it turned out, Air Plus's bid turned out to be the lowest with an all-inclusive pricing in order to avoid any confusion.  Offering to pay in cash, I even got a discount that could offset at least some of the sales tax.  The installation was scheduled the following week.  Andrew and Ed arrived on time the day of the installation.  They were very efficient and very quick, even finishing a bit earlier than scheduled.  By the time I arrived, they were almost done cleaning up and have already instructed my tenants as to the furnace's proper operation.  It was great doing business with Air Plus as they used Trane products (while I'm no HVAC expert I do know the reputation of Trane products), they are friendly and easy to work with from Rhonda to Dan and to Andrew and Ed.  And they were all very knowledgeable, from the contracting aspect to the technical aspect.  Overall a great company to do business with!!</Review>< pics>

<review>My experience with the Air Plus team was exceptionally pleasing!
Kim sold me on Trane products because of her proficient knowledge and thourough explanation of what was needed for the continued comfort of my home, not to mention her kind demeanor!

Jim is a top notch technician who knows how to run a buisiness.  His dilligence and attention to detail far exceeded any expectations I previously had reserved. I feel secure knowing my new Trane units will give me years of comfort with optimum efficiency!  Thank you Air Plus!< /review>< Pictures>

Contacted Kim on 10/29/13 about obtaining new Trane furnace. By happenstance, installer was handy nearby and came out to give estimate. Options were presented on what furnaces could be installed; we considered how they would fit and selected the unit that would work in the existing space. Accepted estimate and Jim came out next day and began installing. Old furnace removed. Old insulation removed. Existing ducting was re-wrapped with bubble wrap insulation. New Trane furnace installed and new matching ductwork installed. Work was swift, neat, and professional. Trane went in clean and the hookup was completed in just five hours. All the leftovers cleaned up and disposed of. All the work was professional, courteous, and on time. The furnace sequence of operations was explained to me so I could determine any failures in the future; handy for a DIYer.
At my request, Jim provided a copy of the service manual for my future reference.
Highly recommended. Five stars.<//text>

Just ate here for lunch on my weekend getaway for my Birthday with my fiance. I started out with the clam chowder which was really good and came out hot and fresh. The highlight of the meal was the sand dabs hands down! That was honestly some of the best fish I've ever had in my life. Talk about melt in your mouth and packed full of flavor without taking away from the fish. As for the cocktail I had the ghost tree martini and it was spot on. Great service, high quality fresh food and awesome atmosphere. Will definitely be returning.

Thank you Pangaea for a fantastic meal!</text>

<Text>This place was great! Our server was awesome and gave great food and drink recommendations. Friday at lunchtime and they sat us immediately. We had our waters very quickly and the environment within the restaurant was good too. Our server recommended the Famers Market cocktail and it was tart and yummy. I had the soup of the day, which was cream of mushroom, then I had the California chicken sandwich for my meal and it didn't disappoint! Will definitely be going again on the next trip.<//Text>< username>

Came on a Saturday lunch, short wait time to seat 2 and our stroller, baby outside. Killer bloody Mary was delicious with several food items served with the drink. Calamari was a great complement for this. The chicken vegetable soup was delicious on a chilly day. The chicken sandwich was also pretty delicious and the fries were crisp and well cooked. Hostess and waiter were very friendly and accommodating.<//review>

Kimchi Fried Rice was just WOW! The Sand Dabs plate was as awesome but my personal favorite is the former. Serving was big, in my opinion (we're not really big eaters, we get full easily). Staff are very friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this restaurant. Should you be around the area, don't miss trying out their food.</review>

<text>Staff was attentive and courteous.  Fish Tacos (grilled Sea Bass) were very good.  Fish and Chips were good as well.  Four stars on the above.  Three stars for the Lobster Bisque and Crab Cakes.  They were a little on the bland side.</text>< pics>

<Review>Great breakfast find. Modern. East/West menu is loaded with great options on both sides. Breakfast cocktails were amazing. Bloody Mary came with sausages, bacon, shrimp, and standard olives/pickels. We had crab benedict and Kim Chi Fried rice. Both excellent. Prompt, friendly service as well.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcVDtHip8sA4zgBj2JCnZhwtRWdNmNUudZA3eK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIM6anOEpOAFf_AqFCPX1Kz_sejA5u9O2qS9DC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808de72a98de279f:0xe82dbed3eb71392a< /gmap_id></record>

Fantastic place and Absolutely bliss.

The break fast was fantastic, and delicious. Outdoor breakfast with the heated lanterns, perfect service, good food, and the location towards Carmel by the beach - Throughly enjoyed.

Excellent morning outdoor dining experience. Will be visiting again to try Lunch / Dinner option.< /Text>

Made reservations for 6 pm and when we got there there wasn't any outdoor seating so the host went out of her way to bring out a table for outside. Food was great. Got ahi tuna and local sand dunes dish. They really know how to do their seafood. It was cooked perfectly and nicely flavored. A friend got salmon and they also loved it. Cooked just right, not over or under. Sauce was on the lighter side, and wasn't dense. Only thing I'd change about this place is the fake flowers inside. Overall, excellent service, great food & good drinks. Will go back to try other dishes. 👍<//Text>

<Review>Amazing fusion food. I'm normally not a huge fan of fusion and unnecessary changes to dishes.. but this was a twist on usual favourites that enhanced the dish. Great spot.< /Review>< gmapID>

This place is AMAZING! If your in Carmel, you must come here. Food is 100/100 and service is even better. Rodrigo was a great waiter. The owner was amazing, also. Would recommend to everyone.<//Text>

Korean and western dishes on the menu. Would prefer if they did fusion, that would be interesting. Good quality and nice presentation. A bit pricey but it's carmel.  Would like to see more interesting seafood options too.< /text>

<Review>Food was great! I love the vegan option (japchae but with no kimchi :)). The coconut shrimp has two rice portions because I gave my family member my portion from my japchae. It confused me a bit why they gave me a portion when I already had the noodles but eh. Also the meals came with two simple salads, mixed greens with light cheese on top (I didn’t take a photo sorry). They’re also doing a great job with taking proper measures to limit the spread of covid-19. Hope to come again in the future when it’s much safer to go outside.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJGGTC3HnKnWSDoU1Ic6ZMN1wC8Wh9BMBYLT5E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXsutDOgfhcaLZ5O6IepsMO3ghjTqHyqOfF254=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Sat outdoors and the food was good. Our group had the calamari (my favorite dish we ordered), clam chowder (decent), kimchee fried rice (lots of flavor and delicious), and lobster ravioli (lacking in flavor). It can get pretty crowded so go early!</text>

The food was delightful. We ordered the three course meal. It came with soup or salad, the main course and dessert. My friend ordered the grilled salmon and I had chicken parmesan. We split both in half so we can taste both. The salmon was cooked to perfection crispy on the outside and tender inside (not dry). The chicken was the same and it was seasoned well. Martin recommended great wine to go with out meal.

When the dessert was served our server Martin offered to serve us coffee or cappuccino. And we did, it was a wonderful end to our dinner. Our server kept our water glass filled and each time he came he had a smile and a story! What an awesome experience!!! Great location, good food, wonderful staff!!! A must visit!!!</text>< Pics>

Just a perfect place for breakfast. The menu is a mashup of American and Asian / Hawaiian offerings.  Eggs and pancakes are first rate.  The spam and rice plate with fruit and avocado is amazing.  Spam you say?  Yep-- small bits mixed in with seasoned rice, not a big slab.  Worth the risk.  All of the plates reflect great attention to detail and a very professional approach.  Strong coffee, very good service, and a nice setting on Ocean Ave.  We're regulars now.</Text>

Really great! Had breakfast and it was very good. Staff is very friendly and the outdoor seating is nice. The only suggestion I have is that since the outdoor seating is on a slight slope with road, a platform to level it out would be nice so that I don't feel like me and my food and sliding down. Idk if that is allowed in Carmel, but would look into it.<//Review>

A friend gave us a good recommendation for this restaurant and we were quite impressed. We had the crab cakes and the eggplant napoleon for appetizers. They were both delicious. I had the coconut jumbo prawns and scallops entree. My husband had the duck breast. Both were extremely well executed and delicious. The staff gave excellent service and the outdoor dining setup (for covid compliance) was cute and cozy. It was a great experience. We will definitely be back.</Text>

<text>Getting in wasn't too bad. Heat lamps were a good touch outside seating. Staff was attentive but not bearing. Ordered the tuna poke and crab cakes both were great. Nice selection of wines. We got the duck breast and seafood pasta of the day, both cooked perfectly with good flavors. Portions left of beyond satisfied. We saw that they offer breakfast and lunch so we planning on returning.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808de72a98de279f:0xe82dbed3eb71392a< /gmapID>< UserId.>

Service is great. The food presentation was beautiful. I am a picky person so the Crab Cakes Benedict wasn't my favorite but it wasn't terribly bad either. Great outdoor dining space with heaters which kept me and my Yorkie warm. Definitely curious to try their lunch or dinner menu. All looks yummy!<//review>

Had lunch yesterday, outside of course.  Service was per pandemic
protocols, which was totally fine and staff very pleasant.
Food was very tasty and hot!  Beautiful outside accommodations.< /Review>

This was a great find. The restaurant is fresh off a renovation, and the result is remarkable. Spacious and airy. The menu offers fresh Korean options I haven’t seen on other menus in town.

I had a great Kimchi fried rice for lunch, and look forward to coming back for the Spam Kim Bap.<//Text>

Get the German Meika! It is an incredible bloody Mary made with gin. The accouterments to it make it an appetizer. This little spot was just lovely for Sunday breakfast.  Staff was attentive and food was exquisite.<//Text>

<time>1551673248622</time><text>Carmel/San Francisco are my two favorite places in all of California. This time I was in Carmel and I will say when i first walked in here i said wow. Loved the interior, the breakfast was excellent, staff were amazing and the bathroom reminded me of a 5 star hotel. I enjoyed everything about it. I asked one of the waiters about the POS system, he told me about it and how they were new systems. Whoever the owner is, you are doing a fantastic job. I will be coming again with my girlfriend soon and will tell everyone in Fresno, CA to go and try it. Amazing food, service, and fantastic experience. 5 stars from me!< /text></record>

Very disorganized restaurant. Not family friendly with small kids. Some guy walked up to look at the outside menu at the same time I walked inside to get seated. The guy was told that he would be seated before my family with small kids who were first to ask to be seated. The hostess made it obvious that it would be awhile before we could be seated. I told her we would go somewhere more family friendly. Probably for the best, as we started to walk away the food looked like garbage that was being served to people here. Also, since when are servers not wearing masks, hopefully the City of Carmel looks into this.<//review>

The staff are very COVID conscious. They're definitely concerned with their guests comfort, pulled the heaters and chairs out for us when they could tell we were cold.  The clam chowder is absolutely incredible, as was the Alfredo pasta!<//review>

We went to the restaurant about 5:45 pm for dinner. We were told that a table would be available in 20-25 minutes. We sat for at least 45 minutes before being seated. The problem was that the restaurant had a 4-6 pm happy hour with discounted drinks and appetizers. About half the tables were occupied, by people who came for that happy hour special continued to stay at their tables, some ordering more wine and not mindful that the happy hour had ended.
We asked the waitstaff about this and they said that they would not inform patrons that happy hour had ended and that they could either order from the full dinner menu or leave to make room for dinner patrons.
With only 6-8 small tables this would have been a more efficient way of handling the patrons.
Those of us wanting to have a full dining experience were compromised by a few “hangers on” happy hour drinkers and the waitstaff did nothing to alleviate the problem. This would not have been a problem with endless seating options but was a gross mismanagement of a very small venue.

<text>So much love here! Wonderful food and great staff. Really upscale cool vibe inside. We sat right by the fireplace and it was nice and toasty. Coffee is good and so was breakfast. I had their version  of an Asian breakfast burrito and also the Eggs Benedict. Both very good.
Everything is so clean and the bathrooms are clean and tidy. I can highly recommend for breakfast. Don't stand in line for cheap food when you can eat here in style💞<//text></record>

But as someone who takes social distancing and mask wearing seriously, it was extremely disappointing to observe one of the owners lower her mask repeatedly to talk to customers as they walked up on the sidewalk between the tables. At one point she lowered her mask below her chin and left it there as she interacted with patrons. I watched her greet two customers who weren't wearing masks, seating them without asking them to put on masks. I get that she may be trying to project an air of friendliness and normalcy, but it is hard for me to justify returning given the dangers her behavior present to the restaurant environment, her health, the health of customers, and the food. I will instead find local restaurants that take necessary steps to protect their customers and take the pandemic seriously.</text><username>Jack Jeworski< /username></record></dataset><record>

The food, service, ambience, and drinks were fantastic. We put our names down at a few places and this happened to be the one that took us right away. So happy they did because they also have gluten free options! We got the fish tacos and a grapefruit mimosa for lunch and it was excellent. This si the spot!< /Review>

Very juicy steak, and elegant pasta (shrimp scampi). I will try Korean dishes like kimchi fired rice and tofu soup (dubu cheegae), since the Korean chef was so proud of her menu.<//review>

<text>Great food and friendly service. The mix Western and Asian cuisine is tastefully done. Portions are also perfect for sharing too so you can try as many dishes. It also has some interesting artwork on the wall which give it a nice mood. It so is not cramped like other restos in Carmel. Overall, a pleasant dining experience and surely a restaurant I would go back to.</text>< pictures>

<Text>My family and I visited Carmel recently, and fell in love with this magical place—

And one of the reasons for our unabashed love for this town was the experience and food we had was just amazing.

The food was wonderful, great portion sizes and cooked so well. Everything from appetizers to the main meal (we were too stuffed for dessert and that’s saying something)...

But as good as the food was, the service and then the owner Mira were even better.

We have a son with special needs (Down Syndrome)—and he was treated like a prince. Everyone was so kind and went out of their way to make him and us feel like we were...cherished.

I can’t recommend this restaurant or owners highly enough. Thank you Mira for creating such a magnificent place in our world.

Lots of love to y’all from Texas!<//Text>< time>

<text>I had an early dinner here recently and was pleased with the quality of the food, service and attention to detail.  Pangea is open for outdoor dining only.  The waiters wear masks, tables are set at appropriate distances from each other, and tables and chairs are deep cleaned between parties.  The food is fresh, with locally sourced seafood, meat and produce.  Burrata is made on site and it is very good.  The sand dab tasted like it was only hours out of the ocean, and the tiramisu was as good as I've had.  Other entrees ordered by people in my party were equally good (salmon and scampi).  The grilled artichoke appetizer has loads of garlic and it's served with a simple and tasty aioli.  I have nothing but praise for this place.< /text>< rate>

Although the restaurant is not open for dining at this time, we had the most amazing to-go coffee & chai tea lattes while we were in Carmel. They were the best part of our mornings & the staff was super kind! For amazing service and yummy food I would recommend spending some time here!</review>

Very good food. Great service. The portions are generous. Sharing appetizers & salads is highly recommended. Our favourite dishes were the poke, grilled artichokes, and the kalbi. Will have to try the kimchee fried rice the next time. Good cocktails as well. Prices were totally reasonable for the quality of food<//Text>

< Review>
Amazing place! I went there with my son.  We went during their happy hour which was an amazing deal. I received a three-course meal, so did my son for a discounted price. The meal started with a green salad; fresh crispy greens finished with some light dressing, just the right amount.  My Salmon fish was flakey and well-seasoned served with veggies and cherry tomatoes. The ice cream dessert was a prefect palate cleanser; light and not too sweet.  My son and I also enjoyed the lemon drops that Austin, the bartender, served us. I liked that he didn't coat the rim of the glass with too much sugar. I</Review>

GREAT food, Fabulous service! I highly recommend this wonderful restaurant. The servers are very attentive. The pairings of the food is exquisite. The manager got us a table in a timely manner without a prior reservation on a holiday weekend. The ambience is so nice!</text>

Great atmosphere, clean and modern.  Sunset three course dinner special for $27.  Highly recommend this place. The food was delicious, especially the claim chowder, skirt steak, shrimp scampi and tiramisu.  Prices were much more affordable than most in Carmel.</Review>

Really fresh food. The clam chowder was amazing and I make it myself from scratch so am picky. We also had short ribs which had a great marinade and was plated with a salad and rice and fresh berries on the side. A really nice environment and food that makes you want to come back. It is fun to have Asian dishes and American dishes on the menu. The chef came to our table to talk to us, couldn't have been nicer.</text>

<review>We just happened upon Pangea and were hesitant because there were not many people at noon on a Saturday.  Well, let me tell you, we are soooo glad we sat down!   Decided on salads with grilled chicken added.  One beet and the other arugula.  We had a feast of super fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, pine nuts, and the lightest hint of tasty dressing.   Their Rose was just the right blend with a hint of grapefruit to quench our thirst.  Amazing service with a friendly smile.  We will be back 🥰< /review><time>1570308420316</time>< rate>

Great ambiance and service.  Mira and husband and Tino (server) are delightful and welcoming.  Mushroom soup was awesome as were Korean Short Ribs.  Ribs were meaty and good flavor.  About as tender as this cut can get.  Chicken wraps were ok.  Artichoke was tasty too.  Make sure to tell them early that you want the creme brulee as they may run out. Chocolate mousse was pretty good though.  We will come back!<//text>

A wonderful dinner where East meets West. If you are in Carmel you must eat at Pangaea Grill. There were meals for vegetarian, vegans, meat eaters and all above. The meal was absolutely delightful.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>A great, unexpected surprise to find on Ocean Ave. Walking along the prettiest line of shops on this bright, breezy afternoon,  I noticed only the exterior menu as there's yet any signage. The decor is an unobtrusive mix of modern over rustic. Best if all - Kimchee fried rice! What a welcome addition to Carmel. I've had enough Italian to last a lifetime .< /review>< name>

So refreshing to find an Asian fusion restaurant in Carmel. The service is excellent, and its such a warm & stylish setting. Besides the food made with such attention to detail, the bar is amazing. Extra points for fresh squeezed juices for the mimosas!!!<//review>

It would be an absolute travesty if you visited Carmel and did not eat dinner at the Pangaea Grill!  The food is amazing and the owner is in a league of her own!  She is and was a sweetheart.  She insisted that we have dessert before we left and made sure we did!  There are no words for how wonderful our evening was!<//text>

<text>BEST. ARTICHOKE. EVER. We don't often order appetizers but decided to last minute, and we're so glad we did. Totally worth the $14. My husband had the duck and I had the kimchee fried rice and I really loved it. The wait staff was really attentive and helpful, the bartender made me a mocktail (preggo) and the atmosphere was romantic without being overly fancy. We would come again!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808de72a98de279f:0xe82dbed3eb71392a</gmapID></record>

<Review>Pangaea showed 5 stars on Yelp! I don't  know how they got that rating. The food is very expensive for the portions you get. The taste of my Ribeye was ok, but not great and it was over cooked. Another person in our party had filet mignon which was also over cooked. I would have gave it one star, but the servers were very attentive and friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place.</Review>< username>

<review>This place was just ok. We stopped by because of the great reviews that ot had but the food quality was lacking. The actual space is very nice, great lighting and very good service. But then comes the food: their prices seemed a little unreasonable for the quality of the food. Dont get me wrong it wasnt bad. But it was not great. We ordered the filet mignon, the spicy pork, the grilled salmon and the rib eye. The ribe eye felt more like New York cut as it was lacking some fat. The spicy pork does deserve 5 stars as it was the best plate on the menu. The filet mignon was OK. I wish I would have tried for of the korean plates as that seems to be their strength. The mango moose was very good.</review></record></dataset><record>

Lisa and I had the opportunity to visit this cozy modern restaurant on a recent visit. The decor is elegant and also exudes a romantic ambiance. The restaurant features a bar that can accommodate walk-in guests, and has a well-selected wine list that can be easily paired with many of the selections on the menu. We were greeted by the maitre d', and seated by a window seat. Part of the attraction of Carmel is being able to observe the storybook architecture, and foot traffic, that so exemplifies the atmosphere of this little gem By the Sea. And, yes, this restaurant provides a perfect starting point for that, since it is located right in the middle of all the activities on Ocean Avenue. But, most importantly, it was the delicately prepared cuisine that will assure our return visits to Pangaea Grill. We had a late lunch, so opted for a light Sunset menu dinner for myself, featuring Sand Daps, and Kimchi Fried Rice for Lisa. The Sands Daps were perfectly done and melted in my mouth with a thin buttery crust. I did have a chance to try Lisa's Kimchi Fried Rice. It had the right amount of spice, and herbs, to make it a memorable rice dish. All ingredients, and fragrances of the spices, could be distinctly noted with perfect balance. Frankly, the best version of this dish I ever tasted. Our next visit will assure a more robust appetite and a try at the Korean Short Ribs. We can't wait, and will be back!<//review>

This place is really expensive and not at all worth the payment. I went with a party and we waited half an hour just to order. Our food came out 40 minutes later. I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was extremely flavorless, even the linguini it was placed upon, which is crazy because I paid $26 for it. Everything is pricy and there's no bread, chips, etc. The filet mignon is $38 and it's about the width of a red solo cup and comes with nothing but vegetables. Lobster ravioli had come out cold and was average. The best thing to order is the kimchi stir fry bowl, which is still pricy but the portion makes you feel like you haven't wasted your time and money. At the very end, it was attempted to have one person pay for a group of people under 30 years old as they refused to split the check. A truly terrible experience. The only reason this gets two stars is because the owner is really nice, but definitely out of touch with how the kitchen and its billing procedures are run.< /text>

< Review>
The food was really underwhelming. The only thing that saved them from 1 star was the service by the barman.< /Review>

<Text>The prior Carmel Grill was great. The new Pangaea Grill in Carmel is high priced, has a limited menu, and the place is very cold, because Korean owners don't believe in heating!

<review>(Translated by Google) Wonderful restaurant! Quickly, without errors (there were some requests-sauces separately; do not put tea in a cup with boiling water ..) Everything that was ordered (salads, artichokes, Fish, tuna) was very tasty and with a beautiful serving! Highly recommend this restaurant!

Чудесный ресторанчик! Быстро, без ошибок( были некоторые запросы-соусы отдельно; чай в чашку с кипятком не класть..) Все, что заказали( салаты, артишоки, Рыба, тунец)  было очень вкусно и с  красивой подачей! Очень рекомендую этот ресторан!<//review>< Response>

<Review>Royce Hall is a beautiful Building inside and out. The university keeps it in wonderful condition. It's easy to hear who is on stage. I always choose to sit on the ground floor as close to the stage as possible. The seats are well cushioned and large enough to accommodate an average person.< /Review>< rate>

Beautiful building and a lovely quad area. A great place to hangout and take pictures. The architecture is fascinating and reminds you of Europe.< /Text>

A great medium sized theater on the UCLA campus.  We were there for a concert and everything from parking, to the shuttles from the parking structure, to the beautiful theater itself were all great. The acoustics were decent and the seats were super comfortable. I look forward to visiting again.< /review>

Royce Hall is stunningly beautiful as is the library across the courtyard. The Acoustics were mind-bogglingly good. It has a wonderful feeling and environment once you step through the doors, and it is a place I feel tremendously comfortable and at home in. Besides that, the person that brought me deserves 6 Stars.< /text>

<Text>Gorgeous theater on an absolutely beautiful campus. Great sound and small enough where all the seats are decent.
The only major ding... why sell alcohol but not tell us that we can’t bring alcohol into the theater!?! So it forces you to chug as soon as you buy the drinks.

Being here is like a dream come true. I always wanted to be a Bruin and now, Royce Hall has become my go to getaway spot. My very first class at UCLA was in Royce Hall so this iconic building will always have a special place with me.</review>

<text>Awesome Venue with family history. Saw a great jazz concert here. My partner is a alumni and hadn't been in the building since she was a freshman. We were staying in the area that night and she offered a tour of the campus and memory lane. We spent most of the next day on the campus.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I have been there many times for concerts, events ets.. the building is historic and beautiful (specially at night with a good moonlight). The only negative that comes to mind is the fact that it is not very accessible and distance between parking and building is considerable. The inside is pretty standard and nothing very stands out but I like its classic soul< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Finally! I have my Sunday morning, football on the big screen, breakfast buffet, cheap mimosa sports bar and so close to my hood that I can ride my bike and take advantage of the great drink specials. In all honesty, I didn't try the breakfast but I know it was free. Kind of dark inside but there is a big open window that lets in a lot of light and has a counter for you to lean on in case there is anyone out there who still smokes. Can't wait 'til Sunday.< /Review>< pictures>

It brings back memories and creates new ones. It reminds us of adversity and rekindles our quest for diversity. It is nostalgia and hope. It is UCLA.< /Review>

A justifiably famous venue. I was just back for the first time since high school and it still inspires that sense of history that 16 year old Misha was taken by. You know the names of the folks who have played here, and something about their essence still lingers. The upstairs poster room is dope too.<//review>

Royce Hall is the landmark icon of UCLA and rightly so. It's beautiful and grand and is a symbol of academic achievement at one of the best institutions in the nation. Utilitarian wise, I have been to several Cultural nights in the historic auditorium and it is the perfect place to host those.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Interesting architecture,  definitely feels old school.   Not particularly ornate as the Pantages  theatre in Hollywood,  still has an amazing feel of authenticity.

The Los Angeles Ballet performance of The Nutcracker in December was delightful.  From the balcony, we could see the entire stage come to life.  My kids enjoyed the ballet, especially my 10 year old daughter.

The audio was good, with ample sound for a classical performance. We will visit again for a concert.  Parking was about a mile walk, but we enjoyed walking through the historic UCLA campus.</review>< pics>

I cannot remember the servers name but she made the whole event so much better. She took orders from inside the crowd and actually brought them into the crowd. She was fast and had a great memory.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It is a big campus, take a while to find the building. Many parking structure on the campus.

Parking lot is close to the building, only a few minutes walk.

The building is well maintained. The theater is not too big. The ceiling is gorgeous!< /Review>

If you're a UCLA student, seeing Royce Hall in its beauty makes you proud to be a Bruin. If you're not a UCLA student, it makes you want to be a Bruin. The auditorium inside is impressively large. The classrooms are relatively new and clean as well. Definitely a highlight of UCLA's campus.</review>

We had the cheap seats so they aren't going to be the best in the house but we were literally sitting sideways facing away from the stage with a railing blocking our view. The parking attendant told us that the garage was the only place to park and that it was cash only (why is it cash only? It's 2019, who carries cash? Also something that should be communicated before even purchasing tickets.) but when we went to get cash we found parking around the corner two blocks away. Even without those two extra blocks it was an extremely long walk with lots of hills for someone dressed up in high heels to go to the theater. The show was amazing and Batsheva dance company is the only reason this review gets as many stars as it did.</Text>

I went to see Tigran Hamasyan play here at Royce Hall and I must say that my experience was rather unfortunate.

I want to point out that while I had a great time at the concert, the staffers at Royce Hall did a relatively terrible job managing the show because while a show is going on, it seems that the ushers let people in as the concert in progress. I understand that this is to let people, who paid for their tickets, in but when it gets to the point that so many people are being let in at 20-30 minute intervals and to the point that the performer himself actually has to stop the concert just to let people take their seats, that just completely ruins the experience for everyone. I truly hope that the staff at Royce Hall is made aware of this because if this is a common practice at the performing center, they should know that letting huge groups of people in during the concert just spoils the performance. It is just rude and inconsiderate to the performer and the audience and it would perhaps be ideal to at least let the tardy people come in at the proper timing instead of during a song.</Text>

I saw the Los Angeles ballet perform Swan Lake here. I've seen a lot of great performers at Royce Hall through the years but it didn't work for the ballet that night. The stage was too small and the ballerinas to crammed. Add to that the fact there was no Orchestra but only pre-recorded music and you really should spend a little bit more money to see a Russian ballet in a larger setting. I would have thought it to be okay and worth the money if they had a real Orchestra given they would still look cramped on stage. Unless your idea of a ballet takes place inside of bus bumping around with people the next time they tour like I said spend a little more money and go see the Bolshoi or Kirov.< /Text>

Hall is great, beautiful inside and quite comfortable. But parking is so convoluted. When paying at kiosk you must enter your license plate number. But this is not posted anywhere so you only realize it after you have parked and walked to kiosk. Also you can only pay cash, exact amount at the kiosk. UCLA hosts so many events its time to modernize their parking system.< /Text>

The exterior is gorgeous but the building is desperately in need of renovation or at least an update. The bathrooms are in the basement while the classrooms are on the first floor. When everyone is let out, the women's room is packed and lead to long lines. The exterior of the building is exquisite and the grounds are beautiful.< /Text>

We say in the right corner of the balcony so couldn't see 20% of the stage. Otherwise, it was the right venue for the Nutcracker performed by the LA Ballet Company.</review>

UCLA is famous for Royce Hall. It is used most often for performances and talks. Hillary Clinton has given a talk at Royce Hall and Chris Martin has performed here. It is very iconic and one of the oldest buildings on campus.<//text>

We say in the right corner of the balcony so couldn't see 20% of the stage. Otherwise, it was the right venue for the Nutcracker performed by the LA Ballet Company.<//Text>

< review>
My family and I attended Brighter in the Dark performance 5/26/18 the show was amazing but the experience was horrible with alumni screaming at the top of their lungs "in support" of the performers. Though I understand, I was extremely disappointed that they were unable to control themselves. It's unfortunate that it ruined a great show. Perhaps you may consider a student/alumni section where they can scream into the ears of others.... While reserving a section for guests who are there to applaud in between acts when it is appropriate. Know, that I wilI caution others of the alumni behavior. I expected more from UCLA alumni.< /review>

<Text>We were there to celebrate 🎉 the independence day! The place is huge and the parking was miles away. The parking attendant told us to get the shuttle but we couldn't find the park so we walked. Ouch with my high heels 👠 lol The common restrooms were all locked and people were desperately looking for a restroom on two different floors. I was sad to see a person using a walking stick climbing stairs and find the restroom closed 😢 finally we snuck to the backstage and used one phew lol. After the show was over we had to walk back (I almost crawled lol) to the parking structure, thumbs down 😎< /Text><Name>Gloria de Silva< /Name>< response>

<text>Atrocious parking set up and terrible internal management..... Doors to the show were closed on us whilst we waited in the foyer, without any warning from staff, unnecessarily forcing us to miss the 1st part of the show. Ridiculous.</text>< pics>
