<user_name>JR’s Way< /user_name><review>⚜️This Hospital here not only looks nice, but the Nurses are definitely Highly Qualified. Their hard work, humbleness, nice smile, and willingness to help and assist really puts them on top of the list. 5⭐️ for this Hospital for having such Skilled personnel working in here.⚜️

⚜️It’s really awesome to see how the Contraction’s Reader “TOCO”
And the
Heart Reader Ultrasound Device, Work in Conjunction to Monitor Babies before they are delivered.⚜️ the Nurses actually doing great work going about taking care of the soon to be Moms5⭐️ to this Hospital⚜️

⚜️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️For Friendly Service, Highly Skilled Staff, More than Qualified to do this type of work Nurses, Doctors, and Midwives. If I trust them with my family, you know for a fact I am going to recommend this Hospital 🏥⚜️

⚜️You should bring your wife and your family to this Hospital if you need to go to one Hospital this is the place. I just like how they are checking in constantly to see how everything is coming and or going with patients.⚜️

⚜️Jackie, Jessica, Phuong, Rocio, Vivian, Hernandez and some others that I have forgotten their names, are Superb and go beyond need it for every patient.⚜️

⚜️Now i have to say one more thing. This Several days that I have been in here, since day when I wrote the Review Above, Several things have happened.⚜️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⚜️

⚜️It’s so awesome, Amazing, and Incredible to watch, how the Staff works to deliver Babies 👶 5⭐️ to this Incredible Team. And I mean Top of the Line Highly Skilled Team. It was about 7 on this A Team, when Baby was born. It’s an Experience I never forget, everyone there had a role, and they all communicating throughout the Delivery process some passing some of their tools and others receiving and putting away things needed and not needed⚜️🥇⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⚜️ I Greatly appreciate how one of the Ladies there was showing me the Placenta and its functions and that it’s the only disposable organ. The front side of the Placenta feeds from Mommy while the back side has Umbilical Cord that goes to feed the baby 🍼 👶⚜️

⚜️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ To All the Nurses, Nurse Midwife, Midwife, Doctors, Physicians, Pediatricians, Translators, Senior Office Clerk, House Keeping, And everyone that has been working on little or a lot on this Maternity Department, You All have my Respect for working with such Passion and a beautiful smile while doing it.

⚜️Thank you All for showing me, how really Team Work should be. If anyone is to receive my vote on best Hospital 🏥 to Deliver a Baby 👶 🍼. San Joaquin General Hospital is by far the winner.⚜️

⚜️5⭐️ 👍🥇🏆👶🏥🍼🏥👶⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⚜️

⚜️Thank you⚜️

<Resp>None<//Resp><rate>1<//rate><Text>THIS HOSPITAL IS GARBAGE !! I had the unfortunate experience with them 5/7/21 - 5/10/21 The only thing that I seen it had going  good for it was the security at the ER door both night and day and the front door witch were good at their jobs. Also  the ER nurses and the nurses in D2 were very good at their jobs. Other than that it is to much to get into but the rest of the experience sucked.< /Text><user_id>100953070775680933057</user_id>< Pictures>

Do not have a baby here. Staff have too many students, very unorganized,  little sympathy for mental health, and take FORVER to treat the baby so you have to stay more than 3 days< /review>

I  always feel like I am a person, in dealing with the staff & clinics, at SJGH and not merely a patient #.

Each time I visit I feel they genuinely care about me and try to do their level best.  Especially Dr. Spencer Wong and his assistants.  I do my part by bringing along a list of questions or concerns, in order to help him drill down quickly to the matter in hand.

All in all I am very satisfied with SJGH & I appreciate all the hard work they do</text>

They will use you as a test subject at your financial expense. When you get a doctor they have you doing testing before getting treatment, before you get the care you need the doctor quit to work at a better hospital. Then new doctor will make you start the testing process over which take months because it’s impossible to get an appointment. I rather risk my life to go to another hospital. Pick a doctor with experience. Thank God I know longer need this hospital.</Review>

I suffered several strokes in March and was sent home from another hospital with vertigo, even though the CT scan clearly showed them.
Two days later, I ended up at SJGH.
While I don't remember going into the hospital, I required emergency brain surgery, as I'd had a massive hemorrhagic stroke.
The nurses were on strike but, I ended up with an awesome traveling nurse in ICU and my family loved him. His name is Joel.
My neurosurgeon, Dr Darby Invergo, saved my life.
Was everything perfect? No. But, I was well cared for. I stayed in ICU for about a week and was transfered out one evening when the COVID guidelines went into effect, on approximately day 10-12.
This is a teaching hospital and many of the docs come in from Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF one or two days a week.
I was completely unable to care for myself but someone came everytime I needed attention, on top of coming in regularly. They were very patient with me and calmly explained things repeatedly.
I have had a long haul and several follow-up appointments that turned into an urgent referral to UCSF, as the heart procedure I required is not performed at the county and my history was such that I needed more than St Joseph's could offer.
It was not seamless and I had to stand my ground with the cardiologist.
I saw a phenomenal hematologist there and she made sure that I got my test results ASAP after we had an in depth visit.
COVID definitely changed the game as far as getting into the clinics, requesting medical records, etc. My urgent referral still took 2.5 months. I got a CD of my heart test IN PERSON in the cardiololgy clinic and paid to send it to UCSF so the doc would be able to study it but people at the hospital advised me what to do and why. Even a customer service rep gave me the most helpful information.
I have HPSJ and a case manager, the latter really helped.
The hospital does have an antiquated computer system.
But, they saved my life!</Text>

< Review>
The worst experience ever! Rude cold blooded nurses, no compassion at all, a very rude security "officer" no help at all, nursing staff is rude and uninformative, most staff seems uneducated and need to go back to medical school! Instead of keeping family of emergency or injured informed they get rude and insensitive! What a shame, especially when family is hurting the most. Instead of nurses being courteous and keeping family informed they tell them not to call because they're overwhelmed! Then dont work in a hospital! The chief of staff needs to work.on classes for compassion and being kind to all!<//Review>

<text>My daughter just had surgery there and I was amazed at the level of care she is receiving.  The hospital is so much cleaner and brighter than any other hospital here in the Stockton area.  The rooms are bigger and two patients in one room is not crowded.  There is plenty of room.  I will request the San Joaquin General hospital over any other local hospital.  Thank you to all who make this hospital so pleasant.<//text>< time>

I went to the ER here with a laceration on my finger. Most of the staff that attended to me were great but I was given no instruction on how to care for my stiches before I left. I also was told nothing about my injury beyond the conclusions I'd come to on my own before arriving at the hospital.</Review>

< review>
I am sincerely sorry for anyone misfortunate enough to need aid from this trash excuse for a trauma center. They have no respect for people. If you happen to t-boned by another vehicle and knocked off an embankment and your car rolls 4 times, rather than care, you can expect to be made fun of mercilessly by the staff for having dirt and coffee in your hair and stuck in a hard chair for 6 hours while you suffer in pain. Oh and don’t expect any prescriptions for pain management or antibiotics for your cuts, even if you need stitches.</review>

<review>I have covid symptoms and me and another person have been waiting outside where we were asked to sit for more than 3 hours. They have covid symptoms too. It's past 7 a.m. at the moment. No one has come to check on us and this other person is coughing a lot and doesn't sound well.
I think they need more staff, there's a lot going on at the moment.< /review>< pictures>

I took my x-rays and covid test over a week ago and the just called to reschedule when the doctor will give me the results... said it could be weeks out.... screw this place. I've had nothing but bad experiences with them. Especially with Dr. Diulio. He told me specifically that it was okay to consume 10-15 ibuprofen when I told g im 8 were not helping the pain in my hands a while back. This place needs to be investigated and shut down< /Text>

If I could leave no stars and my review I would. this is not a baby friendly hospital, this is not a postpartum mama friendly hospital, this is not a patient friendly hospital. the nurses are incompetent and unprofessional. I read the reviews and nervously did come to this hospital because this was where my midwife/OB delivers. I wish I had followed my mother instincts and just went somewhere else when I was in active labor. I would never trust this hospital with my life, and especially a new little life ever again. don’t give them the benefit of the doubt, follow your heart and your instincts and go somewhere else no matter what it takes.

best of luck to anyone reading this ✨< /Text>

<text>Worst service and hospital ever!!!!! The receptionist had an attitude for no reason acting like she’s above everyone, I tried showing her our appointment letter she said no than she said my appointment wasn’t at the time I had told her, when I told her it said it on the paper she said I need to see that paper still with an attitude like I didn’t know what I was talking about. The “specialist” came out to give me a form for my daughter she looked like she was on something he pupils were to dilated than the room was dirty and smelled... we walked out after waiting for an hour because she left back into her room that by way has no window for you to check in or anything. This was in the audiology department...< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Waited 10+ hours in ER after a car accident. Nothing more to say. They should close the hospital if they don't care about patients or even people. One of the PAs was nice but after the wait of endless hours, the on call doctor decided to make my case as teachable moment. Even after a month, I still have pain where she was trying put needle on. Most of the nurses are rude or they just stopped caring. Not something you expect after a horrifying head on car collision. But I thank you for whatever services you provided to me that day.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Better than Saint Joe's and Damerion hospital. Well staft, and always on the ball. My surgeon went beyond his duty to help my situation. I thank him for giving me the chance to walk again. Truly someone that I will appreciate for the rest of my life.</text>

Brothers and sisters don’t waste your time because they don’t have management when you have appointment and come on time then you have to wait more than one hour more and doctors and nurses are don’t have experience just they need your money they don’t care about your health.<//text>

<Review>The oersonnel is really friendly. I saw a Internal Medicine doctor, a Rheumatologist, and a Pulmonologist . This is part of the team of physicians needed to manage my health.
Unfortunately this facility absolutely totally dropped the ball. No follow up. No consistancy. No records 😳.  Gathered much information however there was No culmination of tests or records to offer Any treatment.  Very tired of Health Plan of San Joaquin.

I have been extremely lucky because reading these reviews would little to desire from the hospital/clinics. I was seen in the ER because i was sick yes the wait did take for ever but after that has been amazing. The ER told me to contact phone center for follow up visits thats another bad part to you get lost in a cyclone of holds and dropped or unanswered calls but then i was sent to a GODSEND!!!!!! Adriana a patient navigator from the hospital/clinics help me out so much making me feel at ease with what i thought was going to be the worst decision i had made by going to the ER but she set me up with an amazing DR and she has been so helpful to my recovery i finally had the chance to meet her because i asked her where her office was to go give her thanks in person shes the sweetest most helpful person i have ever met and at my 5? years of age is a lot to say. she received me with the same care and friendliness she gave me over the phone shes a real GEM.</text>

If I could give no stars at all I would but for the simple fact that that the receptionist pronounced my name correctly, the one star was earned. I made an appointment back in February to get a TB screening for work, got my reading and was told that my results would become available at a later date. Since it is now august and I am still waiting on them, I believe those results may arrive in a duffel bag toted by Jesus.</text>

Worst hospital ever! I was literally begging them the whole day I was in there for them to help me because I was just in a huge accident. The very next day they kicked me out and made me walk so I could leave. Forced me to get up and walk to the bathroom I could barely walk!!
Now that I’m trying to get them to send my xrays they are ignoring me!<//Text>

They have cancelled my appointments several times and I have a very serious debilitating disorder that requires doctors attention every month. Also I have asked for referrals to specialists who can help me several times and never received them. I want to speak to someone higher up the ladder who will take my medical care with importance. They treat me as if I were invisible. Iam very upset with this hospital and all the doctors and nurses and how they just try to pass the buck to someone else. The only good thing that came out of this is a very helpful rep who works in the clinic patient services named Adrianna Martinez. This lady helped me today get a new appointment with a new doctor right away. Because I shouldn't have to wait 2 or 3 months to see a doctor, I need to see one every month. So thank you so very much Adrianna Martinez you are an angel. Thanks....<//review>

<Review>Delivered my son there in 1985. They lost all of my pre-registration information and blamed it on me. I arrived at the hospital at 4:45 am. After a check they told me that I wasn't in labor and should go home. Glad I didn't listen because my son was born at 5:17 am. I was a first time mother. They had no information on breastfeeding. I had to share a room with three other mothers.

Every time I went there for prenatal visits the wait would be at least 4 hours. Had a different doctor each time. Every visit they'd ask me if I knew who my child's father was.

I hope things have improved in the last 30+ years.</Review>< Date>

My mom came in for an X-ray 5 minutes before closing and the X-ray person Dave came out from the back crying about them sending another patient over. If you don’t like your job, retire!! The receptionist in the front was very nice. I hate people who complain in front of patients/people they are supposed to be serving!!!</Review>

This review is on my labor and delivery experience, I was already a bit worried I was going to healthy beginnings clinic here and was told that I wouldn't have a set doctor so I didn't even know who was going to deliver my baby. when I arrived to the hospital about 1pm I went to register  in admitting they where doing some construction so there was a lady in the hallway admitting people she was working of her personal phone which was unprofessional.When I got up to the labor and delivery room the nurse asked where my rist band was with my info, well  I didn't get one I was already having concentrations and didn't even notice. The nurse asked me when my due date was I told her August 29 she said no right here it says You're due October 12 I told her no then she asked my name and come to find out she had another ladies file,
The nurse was cold and was telling me I was probably not in labor because I was laughing and talking to my friend she then said there were dips in my babies heartbeat and just left the room so my friend had to Google it, the nurse came back 20min later and I asked her what she meant and she explained it to us. After about a hour of waiting she checked me and I was 8 centimeters dialated to her surprise. The nurse kept leaving I was in so much pain by about 3pm my husband arrived and my friend and him kept having to call the nurse to check on me, she would just say they were busy and there was nothing they could do so they upset all of us and my husband and friend argued with them to come help me. I asked to get a epidural and kept getting ignored so my friend asked if I could get up and go for a walk to ease my pain. The lady who was suppose to deliver my baby (can't remember her name)
Was extremely rude she came into my room yelling "SO DO YOU WANT THE EPIDURAL OR DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?!" I was in so much pain all I could think was trying to stay calm and positive even tho I felt like running away from the hospital at this point. I just told her what did she think was best in a calm voice she then changed her attitude, I went for the epidural, she told me I might need to have a C-section because of the babies heartbeat and I wasn't dilating to 10, there was still cervix on my left side. We waited about 20min my water broke  I tried to push but my baby wasn't moving down, they put in a catheter and gave me some oxigen. My babies heartbeat dropped really low the lady came back and said "Remember what I said might have to happen well we have to go now"
Like 7 staff members came in and tried to wheel me off for an emergency C-section well guess what the wheel was stuck and they had to struggle to get me out of the room I was so stressed out, the male doctor who did my Csection was pretty nice everything went well had my baby boy but overall it was very stressful experience. I stayed 3 days at the hospital the first day in my own room where my husband had to help me to the bathroom because I couldn't even bend over the next two days I had to share a room with another mother. My feet where super swollen a when I asked one of the nurses for extra pillow she just said "you should have brought your own pillows from your house". The food was nasty I wouldn't recommend this hospital to any expecting mother/father.<//Text>

Two stars because the nurse taking care of my mom was good, but overall, take me out back and shoot me first before taking me there.

Mom came by ambulance here against my wishes. I wanted her taken to the hospital she normally goes to, Dameron, but the ambulance drivers REFUSED. She was a "major trauma" case ... she fell and hit her head, but qualifies because she is on blood thinners. I had to park way out by the clinics because the parking lot for emergency patients is way too small.

Because she was a trauma patient, she was not registered, did not sign anything, they just decided to start treating her. Since they didn't register her, the front desk of the hospital where I had to go to find her had no clue she was there even though I watched the ambulance bring her in.

I could not go back to where she was because "we can't have people walking around back there" so I went and sat in the urinal ... I mean the waiting room. Seriously, I have been in GAS STATION restrooms that smelled better than the waiting room.

They kept calling families by the patient's name, a BLATANT HIPAA VIOLATION.

By the time I finally was able to get to see mom she was ready to go home.

The trauma area she was in had curtains between patients. We could hear everything going on, all the moans, screams, etc.

A doctor pulled up mom's test results ... wait, that isn't her name, and I was reviewing someone else's CT Scan.

REALLY?????

This place was SCARY!</review>

LILLIANNA CARMONA who is in charge of volunteers IS THE RUDEST PERSON EVER! please please please dont ever come to this hospital i beg of u. u will regret it. the nurses gossip and do not do their job. the security guards are rude too yes they may be just doing their job but they dont have to have an attitude. the volunteers here are miserable. some students who learn here just get experience and get out because no one wants to work here. THIS IS AN OLD HOSPITAL so i advise that u dont get treated here, you dont work here, you dont volunteer here and especially dont ever step foot in this place. BAD VIBES!</Review>

I’ve had a few bad experiences at this hospital. The staff lack experience and professionalism. On my first bad experience they didn’t care for my mother or brother throughout the birth experience. They almost caused the death of him by not properly caring/checking up on him and then after numerous times of asking for help they had to rush him to the children’s hospital in SF because he was on the verge of death. My second bad experience was during my fathers surgery. The young male physician who spoke to us was highly unprofessional and rude. I also asked for a doctors note for work to care for my father while he was recovering and he completely disregarded me and even dared to say that his wife was in the same profession so he refused to provide me with a letter stating my fathers condition. This hospital has had a terrible reputation and continues to due to their lack of empathy, experience, and professionalism.</Review>

<review>Terrible. The woman who answer the phone is absolutely stupid with rotten attitude I don't know how she even get that job. I called 3 times and got transfer to the wrong place or left hanging for 20 minutes and I had to call back again. I explained but she rudely cut me off and transfer to the wrong department again. I couldn't get any appointment, wasted all morning for nothing and was left with a bad mood and a painful stomach.</review>< user>

<response>None< /response><Review>I've had several bad experiences with this hospital, in both Emergency Services and routine appointments. Three separate occasions within last 6 months in E/R they have rooms filled with inmates with and without shackles and cops all over in hallways. One time it was overloaded in April I believe with inmates and tb outbreak in there according to the nurses teasing each other of their exposures and staff yelling accross to each other of TB (inmate) patients and just laughing about it. Not one of the staff was taking any protocol to quarantine them from exosing other patients. When I was admitted in and I brought this to Doctors attention, he denied any outbreak and said "the staff was unprofessional" .  Again, I was recently I was in ER and rooms were filled with inmates and cops, all other patients had to treated in triage and it was a full house.  Staff will only treat up to their "Emergency Room protocol of tests" and discharge you, just terrible service. Another time recently, about a month and half ago or so I was there with my daughter and granddaughter in E/R,  I noticed an elder patient next door, there was a staff member (idk if she was a nurse or some sort of attendant, pretty sure she had on a burgundy jacket or scrub with some kind of medical screen print on it. She had long black wavy hair, short I think Hispanic, she was yelling at the Elder lady over and over to sit down and stay there, and yelling to other nurses in there that the Elder lady took out her iv, she was very very rude and unsympathetic to her. This went on for quite some time,maybe 30 min give or take.  It seemed to me that the Elder lady may have had Dimentia, she must've been in her late 70's or early 80's. I wanted to defend that poor lady so bad, but at the same time I didn't want to ruin the care my 3yr old granddaughter needed so desperately. Those Doctors too, when they change shifts, one could say they are gonna keep u there for a bit for close observation and when another comes on all cocky, they will discharge you outta there. I've been seeing a few Docs there and not happy, I thought if I had all my Docs in one facility it would be beneficial for my overall health conditions but they don't even communicate together and will shrug off the fact that my primary care is there in the facility. Also my primary care Doc won't prescribe some meds, and when she does, she doesn't take in the effects it may cause on me to complicate my health issues. And when they updated their software of everyone's medical information, some of patients information did not transfer over (this was confirmed with a staff member there). There have been just so so many bad experiences with this hospital, and that is so sad that medical professionals these days seem to only care about the dollar and forgetting the compassion to helping people. And the jails need their own hospital. Or open a separate wing for them, they shouldn't mix with the general public in the hospital, putting others at risk. And the Hospital really needs to take professional measures to possible exposures for others safety not joke about how they've already been exposed. I've seen so much playing around in the E/R by staff members and hearing them gossiping & complaining of patients on the floor is totally unprofessional.</Review><Rate>1<//Rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

<text>The staff hear is by far the worst. They generally don't care about their patients. They had discharged a disabled person I know and didn't have the decency to get ahold of his care provider to let them know that this person is being released and to come pick em up, even after the care provider had specifically gave them the info to them so they could do so. Long story short my poor friend sat in the waiting room for almost 24hrs after being released with no food and no $ not even knowing where they were. And the entire time the care provider was calling the hospital asking about my friend, and they said "we don't know know where the person is and we can't find them in our system." Would give them negative stars if I could.<//text>< pictures>

I also want to say I had a relative do an very highly risky surgery  there and the Hospital staff was 100% PERFECT! They allowed me to stay in the room with the patient due to difficult situations and this was very very appreciated! I am so thankful to SJCH!
I have been to SJCH many times and generally all are friendly but the General Practice Medical Doctors seem very very very tight on seeing patients. Several times had issues with lack of personal time or pushing off my symptoms which concerned me immensely. I had seen three MD thus far and was not really happy with any of them, but the absolute worst if an Asian MD female, Dr. Lee. Look see below more people complain about her. Call the hospital to complain about her so they will fire her.

Will write more later.<//Review>

I was brought in after a motorcycle accident on 12/21 and they immediately had their full staff do a complete analysis on my treatment plan.  I was extremely well cared for.  Can't thank their entire staff enough.  Donna, Rick, Chuck, Harjit (sorry for the names I forgot).<//text>

Any other hospital is better than SJGH. It is a learning and practice hospital. I have delivered two babies here, and nothing has changed at all! Trainees comes right in and train on me without asking for permission. Nurses and trainees are not that good. They always have a hard time drawing my blood and or finding my veins. After having my baby, I had to share a room with another mother! Staff members are unorganized. They never gave me back my insurance card because they lost it! Nurse don't know her way around the hospital! Ultrasound tech couldn't figure out to turn on her computer for hours! While I was there, for a few seconds, I thought WTH am I? You often see prisoners still in orange jumpsuit come to get medical attention there! You generally don't see this at any other hospital!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Unless you are dying, do NOT go to this clinic. The doctors are INCOMETENT.  The whole office is run poorly.  The only saving grace is the support staff, who are very nice, but whose hands tied because the jerk pompous doctors who have NO idea how to practice medicine do not allow the patients to be treated. Bottom line: DO NOT GO THERE.  IT IS TRASH! If there was less than 1 star, this place would be prime for it.</Text>

I was rear ended by a driver that fell asleep and was brought into the emergency room.
Everyone there was exceptional! Excellent care and excellent staff.

<Text>I received a mammogram today in the Radiology department. This was not my first mammogram, I expect some discomfort but not to the extent of what happened today. The scan was going well, some discomfort but the third scan on each breast caused me so much pain that my heels lifted off of the ground. This is not what you should expect during a routine mammogram. Either the technician is a rookie or is extremely insensitive, I would give ANYTHING to give her the same treatment she gave me. I will not be getting further exams at this Radiology department, no thank you. I spoke to a supervisor, Rick, on the phone about my experience and felt that the ball would be dropped with him. If you want professional and compassionate care during routine exams DO NOT go here. I will seek care elsewhere.</Text><user_id>105364427138710645310</user_id>< rate>

<Review>Yesterday I felt uncomfortable in my mouth, and I went to the emergency department. From 1800 to 0400 of next day, I can do nothing but wait. I reflected two times to the registration desk, and they just keep my waiting. The staff of ER is horribly short. I don't recommend the emergency department unless you are dying, or you are very patient.</Review>< Gmap_id>

A 15 year just passed away at this hospital, read below ...   grieving Stockton family claims San Joaquin General Hospital staff's negligence led to a 15-year-old's death.

Yunique Morris died last Thursday.

The 15-year-old was a healthy, active student and cheerleader at Weston Ranch High School in Stockton.

Two weeks ago, Yunique complained of ongoing chest pain and was seen by her doctor at San Joaquin General Hospital,KTLA sister station KTXL reported Friday.

Speaking to the Sacramento-area television station, Yunique's grandmother, Wanda Ely, said the teen's doctor diagnosed her with chest wall pain. She was given pain medication and antibiotics then placed on bed rest.

“Her health just started going downhill," Ely said. "It got to the point where she couldn’t even go up and down a flight of stairs without getting out of breath.”

A few days later she returned to her doctor. The family said the doctor insisted her illness was minor and she was experiencing inflammation.

Yunique's mother was still concerned, so she asked for an X-ray. Days passed, but Yunique's health did not improve.

“She felt nobody is helping her and she didn’t really understand what was going through her body, but she knew something wasn’t right," Ely said.

Then last Thursday Yunique sent her mother an urgent text message.

"I NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, I JUST PASSED OUT, I’M THROWING UP NOW," the message read.

Her older brother rushed her to the emergency room at San Joaquin General where doctors found numerous blood clots in her chest. She died within hours.

Devastated by the teen's death, Ely and her family are looking for answers.

An autopsy is being conducted at the Children's Hospital in Oakland. The family said a cause of death won't be known until at least late next week.

An administrator with the hospital told KTXL that the hospital could not comment on the incident because of patient confidentiality.< /Text>

I delivered my son here a few weeks ago, I was basically forced to breast feed the time I was there. They asked me if i was going to breast or bottle feed i said bottle feed once i was in the recovery room and my baby was brought to me they said i should breast feed because i would need a prescription from the doctor to get bottles. I wasnt producing anything my baby lost 1lbs in the two days that he was there and developed jaundice, he wasnt wetting enough diappers, baby would cry from beeing hungry and after i asked for a bottle again they wouldnt give me one. I was discharged and had to take my baby to the doctors twice that week to have his jaundice levels checked. As soon as i got home i gave my baby a bottle he was finally able to eat and started wetting diapers and in a few days gained weight and his jaundice levels went down. If it wasnt for them making me breast feed I would have given them a positive review. The staff was very nice and attentive but they should respect the mothers wishes if they choose not to breast feed.<//Review>

If I could give them a below zero, I would! Worst hospital ever! I've worked at many in the area. They are rude and barely speak English. They hung up on me several times after not understanding what I was saying. I asked for the nurse's names and they refused to tell me. I was hung up on once again. I'm not racist. I'm half Mexican. If you can't speak the language, you should not be hired. Period! No bed side manner whatsoever and made themselves look stupid. I atist don't know my family members condition. I'm not sure they do either. Disgrace.<//review>

She would say some offensive to make you unhappy. She do not care your struggling. She is most terrible doctor i had ever seen. Do not recommen this woman.

Please read this glimpse of the 4 week hell I've been going through. Western Dental 1332 E Yosemite Ave, Manteca, CA misdiagnosed my tooth pain as an abscess. Saw another dentist who looked at a copy of the xrays Western Dental took, and saw that a wisdom tooth was touching the main nerve in my jaw. It requires surgery that I am currently waiting for.
My current dentist prescribed Vicodin which is all California guidelines will allow. This medication did not touch the pain. After being awake for over 50 hours, my wife forced me to go to the emergency room as my primary care provide (which is also in this hosp) could not fit me in for a week. I waited in the hallway for 1.5 hours without my wife. At this point I am crying and embarrassed. The pain has been so unbearable my wife said I blacked out a few times.The Physician Assistant that saw me is named JASON BLACKSHEAR. I told him my story as they would not allow my WIFE to be in the exam room with me. He looked in my mouth for less than it takes to blink and said I have an abscess. I just told him that I do not have an abscess. My wife even brought paperwork from both dentists and the oral surgeon of our visits as she knew I might be labelled as a drug seeker. He said there was nothing he could do. Visually upset and angry I asked the R.N. to see the actual attending physician. He said I couldn't.
No compassion. No professionalism.
Do not go to this e.r., please, and I hope that MR. JASON BLACKSHEAR, P.A. stops "practicing" medicine and finds a different career to pursue.
Thank you.< /Text>

<text>Excellent customer service! Carl and another associate,  whose name I did not get, were kind enough to travel to my home, fix a blemish on the interior of our tub, offer to replace a cracked air valve and walk me through proper weekly, monthly and yearly maintenance for our tub. They truly care about their customers and their work.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1614003134579, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review, Nathan.

<Review>I waited to write this review until everything was delivered and up and running. First let me say thank you to everyone working at Spa Max and a big shout out to Frank. From beginning to end he has been great with communication and has put up with my continuous questions.

I ordered my Cal Spa back in the middle of July. I didn't quite fully understand how much the spa industry was impacted by Covid. Orders for spas were through the roof and the factories are all having to scramble to fill orders while still keeping everyone safe and following the regulations. We were quoted an 8 week lead time but warned things could change. They did! Unfortunately the factory sent out multiple delays. Each time frank communicated with me. This was important to me. I understand things happen, especially right now. If I hadn't received that communication I would have been upset. Frank was great. I didn't always get the update I wanted to hear but at least I got something. We always had good conversations.

Finally my time had arrived and my spa was finished. I got my delivery date scheduled. The Spa Max delivery team arrived and went to work. They too were great. They positioned my spa exactly where I wanted and got everything set up. Frank was able to get me some extras as a thank you for being understanding and patient during the longer than usual wait.

The delays taking place right now  are not the dealers fault. Manufactures are trying to keep up but it going to be a long road to get there. Be patient everyone. It will be worth the wait.

Thank you again Spa Max for the great service.</Review>< user>

Spa Maxis a wonderful company. The service is professional, courteous and very knowledgeable. Take a good look at Coast Spas they are built with quality in mind and have options that will amaze you. Check out the infinity edge spa it is fantastic and very beautiful. Coast spas is the cleanest hot tub in the industry and will stand the test of time.< /review>

Rick is a wealth of knowledge - ask him anything and he is ready to steer you in the right direction. He's not trying to sell you the most expensive spa, he actually listened to find out what kind of spa was best for my family! Conveniently located right off the 91 fwy (you can see his signs from the freeway) - definitely recommend a visit!</text>< Pictures>

Love that I can experience the hot tub experience by trying before I buy. Yes, bring in a towel and suit and try all the wet spas out before purchasing. Rick and his staff have the knowledge, experience, and expertise in the hot tub industry. Need parts, spa supplies, chemicals, or just looking to splurge on some new extras this is the place to go for the best prices in the Inland Empire.</text>

We purchased a reconditioned LA Spas H.E.E.T. Hot Tub at a fair price and Rick's Spa fulfilled all that they promised and then some. The Hot Tub meets all of our expectations and Rick's customer support has exceeded expectations. They are very knowledgeable and offer quality products at fair prices, and they support the product and the customer.< /Review>

I am associated with Make-A-Wish Orange County and the Inland Empire.  I also make sure all spa wishes are completed and the wish kids are happy.   Most of our spas are shipped to Rick's for delivery and he has handled all problems with the upmost satisfaction from Make-A-Wish.   We had a swim spa that had many problems.  Rick's crew stayed on the situation until the spa was up and running.   Rick's will continue to be our point of contact for all deliveries and service for our wish kids spas.</Text>

First yes this is a real review. This was the worst experience I have ever had. I spent 20 some thousand dollars for what was a new swim spa. they didn't send right crane for it. so it was dropped. then when it was in no one showed me how to use it. then later that day it started leaking. I also didnt get clip for cover. people were in such a hurry. it went down hill from there. there was silicone in all the lines that I got a very bad rash from the controller didn't work right. I was told it was dog food lol (in a 5' spa right) I had to empty it a bunch of times( 12000 dollars in water they said they would give me back. truth was they knew nothing about this spa it was a prototype and not even Catalina spas really knew about it. I had to have the guy that designed it over here and it still doesn't work.The few times they did come out. I got conflicting stories about what was to be done or what was happening. And trust me they never called me it was me calling 50 time a day to get anyone to just have them tell me they didn't know what to do. They DO NOT take back faulty spas. They just keep trying to fix them. so now. I am stuck with a spa that STILL doesn't work. I am selling for parts. I tell you right now do not use spa max you will never get what you need. if I could give a - 5 I would. they are really bad.< /text>

According to my records the spa was working and Bobby, your sales guy who also made a home visit to you remarked that when you spoke with him afterwards, the spa water was much better.\nIf you are telling me that the spa has another challenge, we are certainly willing and wanting to take a look at it and see what is going on. No need to part it out, if you really have a faulty spa we are happy to replace it and pay all delivery and crane charges as we want to always make things right.\nIt is always the goal of SPA MAX to deliver 5-star service and products. Clearly this spa had a challenge with it being a one of kind special built unit, and we all apologize for that. We certainly are with you all the way in either the repair or replace process. Please, let’s all be reasonable and work through this together.'}<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcc8ee50e9cbd3:0x7fc3aa92e58b517b</gmap_id></record>

When u call he seem friendly but I will tell u his prices are way to high! Spa steps he sales basic ones for 99.00 bucks much higher than the 49.00 on amazon or eBay and other local stores. Also I wanted to make my jacuzzi digital and he charges 600 for a new unit that can be purchased for 280.00 online. He should be more competitive then perhaps he wouldn't have had to close his other location.<//review>

<Review>Spa Max has a huge inventory of Spa, large and small, used and new. The salesperson was informative and honest. I ended up buying a used Spa that would have costed 3x the price if new. They were able to deliver the Spa at my home almost 90 mins away and help me set it up at the location I wanted. A few months later, there was an issue with some small leak and since I bought an extended warranty, they were able to send out a tech to fix it within 3 weeks. The second issue was the oxidizer no longer functioning and again, they were able to replace it with a quality part soon afterwards. I've been pretty happy with the service thus far.</Review></record>

<UserId.>110336689691948214625<//UserId.><time>1496605759844</time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I have not owned a Hot Tub before, and decided now was the time - a retirement necessity - LoL.
My initial impressions of Rick's Spas were - # Large showroom, with a large assortment of makes and models.  # We were greeted at the door, and encouraged to ask questions  when we were ready.  # No sales pressure at all.
After we narrowed our search down to four tubs that suited our requirements, we began asking questions.  I did a fair amount of research before even going to look, so I began with questions we already knew the answers to - you know - "testing the waters".  These guys know everything about every make and model they carry.  The pros, the cons, and the reasons why.   They do not have a hidden agenda for "pushing" one brand over another.
There were several "used" spas on display, but my preference is the same as buying a car....Buy new - you do not want somebody else's problems or leftovers, and common sense tells me that you do not know how the tub was previously maintained or used, and some problems are not initially apparent - so we shopped for new ones.
Their prices were on par, with a nice discount for cash purchase on a hot tub.   Delivery,  cover,  steps and start up chemicals are included in the price.  This alone set them apart from "other" stores I have been to - who charged for these in addition to the price of the tub.
We narrowed our choice down to two tubs , and decided to research both a bit further before purchasing one.  We came back the following day - our selection being made.  We selected the colors, paid, and were given a 3-4 week window since the tub is manufactured in Oregon and shipped here.
The only "hiccough" was - it actually took 5 weeks for the whole process, and I had to call at the 4 week mark to check on delivery status.  My spa was delivered and set up exactly 5 weeks after ordering.  My only critique is - I should not have had to call Ricks Spas.
I am very happy with my Hot Tub, and highly recommend  Spa Max (Ricks Spas) to anybody who are considering getting a Hot Tub.  You get great prices, large variety, and no "surprise" costs at the end.< /text><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcc8ee50e9cbd3:0x7fc3aa92e58b517b</GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Diane Beard-Enrique< /name></record>

I had no idea what kind of spa I was looking for when I walked in the door to Spa Max (formerly Rick's Pool/Spa).  Fortunately they had a HUGE inventory.  Seriously... My legs were getting tired by the time I had walked around to see all the different makes & models of spa's.

The salesperson on the floor at the time was super helpful, I believe his name was Bobby...  Anyway, I had all kinds of 'newbie' questions since I hadn't done much research before walking in.  I'm the kind of person who very much likes to make my own decisions and don't appreciate being 'sold'.  That being said, I'm really glad Bobby made a few suggestions that definitely helped me out.  I'm a tall guy, about 6'3".  The tub I originally picked looked good to me, but Bobby pushed me towards a less expensive spa!  Seriously?  Yup.  He said that the seats were too shallow in the hot tub I was looking at and that:
1. My knees would come up to my chest when sitting down
or
2. I would spread my legs out and interfere with the seating of the person across from me.

I would never have thought of this on my own and I appreciated the non-aggressive, informative approach taken.  There were a number of other pieces of information they provided me through the decision making process - too many details to list here, but they definitely know their stuff.

I walked in thinking my budget was for a refurbished tub, which they have TONS of; but after discussing some financing options they were able to get me into a new tub!

It seemed like the refurbs were going for $2k on the low end, to about $5-6k on the higher end.  They also had new spa's going for $4k-$15k+.  You just need to weigh out what's important to YOU in regards to luxury, room, amenities, etc.

Rick, I am replying to your response from 7 months ago.  In your 1st paragraph you stated "This would be fixed".  Seven months have gone and still no repairs, fixes or even a response.  Seven months ago would be in May 2017 by the date posted in the first review.   After many failed attempts, my concerns have fallen on deaf ears.  I am now going back to public reviews in hopes of a satisfactory response or at least to warn the potential new customer.

This is a follow-up.  In June, Saturday June 24th 2017 to be exact.  I sent a text to bobby on his cell phone because I had no response from the calls  I made to the store.  The text included video of one of the topside panels malfunctioning and characters that read "  This is Janet in Yucca Valley.  I want my pool fixed now.  I have given you ten months.  I have nothing fixed no manual and the covers you still have not replaced.  I have had at least a dozen phone calls to you and made several times that a tech has came out but they have never fixed anything."
To date, November 28 2017 the only response is one phone call months ago from your company saying my cover had came in and they will have a tech call to make an appt. to bring out my new cover.  No one has done THIS or anything else to resolve the items listed below:
1. No owners manual that you (Rick) stated in your response, that a new hard copy would be mailed to me.
1a.  No copy to date has been received.
2.  No one has called to give me a date to deliver my pool cover.
2a. Still waiting
3.Topside panels have never been fixed
3a. I believe they are defective and the tech that came out months ago was not schooled in these panels and he had no instruction on how they should have worked correctly.  Maybe another reason why they can't seem to get a manual to me ???
4.  The Ozone component of the spa that broke within the first several months and they replaced is broke again.
4a.  They have never bothered to bring another ozone out and replace the 2nd bad one I took photos of...
5.  As of today, the Jacuzzi still randomly kicks off the breaker.  To the point that I have had my Ca State Licensed electrician replace 3 times as to make certain that there is no fault on my side.
5a.  At this point I am loosing $$$ in my bed and breakfast without having a Jacuzzi that is in correct working order.  Not to mention other issues.

In conclusion,  your promise to follow up with Bobby to insure this happens ???  also to gain my trust...

Short and sweet.  Nothing has happened.  I WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS AND POST CONTINUOUSLY  TILL THE ISSUE's ARE RESOLVED

Bought a brand new Cal Spa 2 yrs ago this November. Buying it Brand New believing that I would have warranty on the darn thing thru CalSpa. The spa now has a leak on one of the fittings and talk to Cal Spa directly. What Spa Max aka Ricks Spa lied about the Spa is a "AS IS " by Cal Spa. So not even 2 years into and a broken Spa. Don't trust these guys

Update 9/15.
After this review the company contacted me. The Cal  Spa I bought does have a 3 year warranty thru Spa Max. Bobby called me and corrected my account and apologized for any confusion. Spa Max sent out one of their repair men to fix the leak. The company also waived the service charge that is required for the visit for the error in the warranty situation.  I had originally given this place "ONE STAR" for the above comments. Spa Max did a great job of correcting this problem with the warrant and the leak. Only reason I am giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'm still disappointed in the fact that the Spa did not have the warrant by Cal Spa's and I didn't find that out until I called Cal Spa's with this issse.

All in all thru out this entire event not once was anyone unprofessional.

If you're looking for a Spa give these guys a look.
And to Rick the owner thank you for care in customer service.</Text>

<Time>1441480309752<//Time><username>Mitzie Chambers< /username><text>OK heres my review of Ricks Pool and Spa. WOW where do I start with my experience. Now I see why they have a F rating on there BBB as I should have done my research before ordering from them. First I seen a ad on this big sale and I could buy direct from the factory, so I drove up to Ricks Pool and Spa and they did have probably 100 Hot Tubs sitting everywhere . Some had scratches, dirt and crap inside, but there were some that looked brand new too. I asked them where the cheap spa was they were advertising was and they told me they only had one and it was already sold, yeah right but I still liked that they had so many to choose from and I could buy and take it home. The salesman smelled of alcohol and smoke, but he ended up getting us a good price(well we thought) on a $7000 tub with cool lights and lots of jets. He said they could deliver the next week. We paid for it with check in full and went home to prepare our spot to put.

Well 1 week goes by with no call so we called to check and they said the delivery guy was out sick and could deliver next week. Another week, no call, so we call again, same story. We then told them we would just pick-up so they said ok but refused to offer us any compensation for having to do this. So we get it home, wire it, and it trips a breaker immediately. We call, they say we must have wired wrong, but send someone out a week later to look. Guess what, we wired it correctly, but it was a faulty control pack. So another week goes by and I called EVERYDAY to make sure they actually came back out and they did and swapped it out. We get it full of water and wait for it to heat...  Well we go to get in as its 101 and we notice water all around the bottom. We call again and this time speak to supervisor who promises us free chemicals (woohooo) and he comes out the next day. He ends up fixing the leak as it was a leaking jet, but leaves foam pieces all over our deck and says he's sorry but they don't have a way to replace the foam they tore out to fix leak. So now i have a spa with less insulation because they have bad quality control, hmmmm, not ok to me but nothing I could do. The spa works fine for a week and then another leak on the opposite side. We go through the same deal again and for the 4th time a repair guy comes out, but it takes 2 weeks and 7 calls to get him there. At this point I requested a new tub or refund and I spoke to the owner and he says they can't do that as they just had a new employee who didn't seal the jets correctly, but they can easily fix it for me. Well with no options I said ok. It runs for 5 more weeks and I THOUGHT the deal was over, and then guess what, trips my breaker again and the power pack has a large burn spot on it. So now it almost burns my house down!!

Needless to say now I no longer want the spa as it is NOT safe and poorly built as a quick review of Master Spas and Ricks Pool and Spa shows how incompetent they are. This company is a joke and I will tell everyone and I know off my story to keep them from going through this. $7000 and 3 months later I have a giant soaking tub that they refuse to replace or refund, so now I must sue them, which I intend to do and immediately!!  The owner is the most arrogant jerk I've ever talked to and there pathetic customer service and salesperson further proves the whole company is ran the same way. By the look of all the crap everywhere there going out of business or something anyway, so now I just have to try and get my $7000 back from Ricks before that happens!!

Why I am not surprised with Ricks response!
Rick, just give my father his money back for this algae pond in our backyard and I will remove my "Fake Review" as I'm sure all the other bad ones on your company are just "fake" ones too. Your arrogance is exactly why I am so upset, just do the right thing and either refund us or give us our money back! No one deserves to spend $7000 of their hard earned money and be treated like this!< /text>< rating>

< Review>
We just discovered this place and it is FABULOUS! My only gripe is that it's not open earlier (2pm on weekends and 4pm weekdays) We ride our bikes down there and would like to be able to go earlier in the day. But other than that, this place is awesome! Great views, comfortable and fun seating, delicious food (Poke!).< /Review>

<Text>Great place to grab drinks and food.

The view is great and they also have heat lamps in case it gets too windy. Very comfortable environment.

They had a great selection of drinks. They also had very tasty food.

I recommend the mini corn dogs and the churro dessert.

I highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a view and some drinks.<//Text></record>

I went early to get prime seating and the whole time I was there I was harassed by at least 15 different groups of people wanting to know when they could take my seat. When you’re paying $500 in a matter of a few hours for a “relaxing” spa day/lunch you dont expect to be bothered the whole time you’re there trying to enjoy yourself. One guy hovered over my table until I left and then a fight broke out because someone else wanted the table. The “first come first serve” obviously doesn’t work. Please hire someone to seat guests or have security present to make sure people are being respectful of others.<//text><user_name>Amber Olson</user_name><rating>4</rating></record>

< review>
The 2 stars are for the view. The view is awesome and great. But when you view the menu prices you will probably 😵😱 yeah if you got money to burn this place is for you. My advice is eat at wendy's or something like that and get full. And than you should come here for a overpriced drink and the gorgeous view. But I'm sure people who live in h.b can afford eating here and enjoying it. But if you are not making real money don't come here. As for the food it's good but I can't say it matches the prices. I'm just saying and being 💯</review>

<review>If you’re looking for the best rooftop in Huntington Beach this is the spot.  Unfortunately you cannot make reservations and the doorman do not seem to be persuaded by cash.   My girlfriend and I actually got into a huge fight because I was rushing her so we could make the sunset, but it was all worth it in the end.

Great drinks and really good food with an amazing view, I would’ve stayed there longer and enjoyed being on the rooftop but it just became too cold for us to stay.  Definitely bring a sweatshirt or something warm I actually saw a girl with a blanket not sure how she managed that but it was a smart move.<//review>< name>

Plastic cup drinks, wasn’t worth the park and walk up the hotel. The waitress was nice but would rather go elsewhere for the investment. Relaxing or depressing ?< /review>

Great view&great staff but what im getting from how much i pay is... in all plastic cups like this. I expect much more when i go to rooftop bars ordering cocktails with different glasses. I feel like this is part of the full experience. I mean it’s not cheap place but i feel like a bar on the street  could serve it better🙂. It’s not different from when you go to starbucks and order some coffee lol 2cocktails for almost $50 with mandartory kinda tips they added after i leave</Text>

This place is pretty secluded place in DTLA so its easy to miss. Nevertheless my friends recommended this place so why not give a try. My party came here at around lunch time and the front bar at the entrance was actually full but once I went further inside, it was mostly empty.  The ambiance is really dim inside with a really beautiful fountain sitting in the center. I truly enjoyed that view.</review>

It's a bit of a drive for me, but I really enjoy coming here. Not only are the views unparalleled, but the waiters and bartenders are extra friendly and always recommend the best drinks and food. Lots of seating options available and you can valet your car so you don't walk far.</text>

< Review>
Now onto the sole reason I am writing this review. Many people complain about the price of drinks in LA. Fact is they are expensive. I always expect that. However here there was just no consistency. I ordered a Clase Azul on the Rocks, which is a Tequila that costs around $80 a bottle on the high side. So I would expect this pour at a bar to be around $25-$30. I was in utter disbelief to see that I was charged $61 American Dollars.< /Review>

<review>Starting with CHRIS the salesperson for the area to the staff in the front office setting up the construction start date were awesome and friendly and answered all questions. Mike the project manager and finally but  definitely not least the hardest workers of them all were the team of Alejandro junior and Alejandro senior. They were absolute beasts! Day in and say out they worked and made sure the ground was primed and ready for the pavers. Every question I had or change I wanted it was quickly addressed and thoroughly taken care of. All the staff of Systems Pavers deserve high recognition and a raise! Well done we are absolutely satisfied and all the neighbors are impressed at the look and quality of the job.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRyM6bBqQov5BrsRk3cxm22bMzPNa69nsxX60s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx8L9RprlwkgrWOPDS6Tzu70UXvT0XQGXSM6Me=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1QFzFXNpwjN_dmbRj_6lkiGafX8EIkOpvb4lh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5e6U5wdP5FB0TZAEOJwIBHM5KrQdfKdTo5uZl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl-wRvvA2UR0mq_y8WWzw8IuGKAcklhu_GpWhG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1CJDMFS8fkg0ZlsUhDuXRQvsYB-1mxINQBhAW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

I posted during the process, but now that it's completed I've included before and after photos. We started off thinking we wanted a paver area for a fire pit and then the ideas evolved from there. We received quotes from nearly a dozen companies to do pavers and/or turf and ultimately decided on System Pavers after all the great help and insight from Albert the designer. He was great helping us come up with a vision for the backyard and the pricing was competitive. I am a tough and demanding customer who pays attention to every detail and Mark, our project manager, did a great job talking me through every step and answering all my questions throughout the process. Jeziel, Nacho and crew were also great at being patient and resolving any concerns I had and did an amazing job when it was all said and done. We are loving our new backyard.< /Text>

So happy with their work! Mike was awesome in helping us out with planning our design. Mark and Juan were always helpful in answering our questions and with modifications as the work was being done to make it look amazing. We had a bit of a change midway during our front porch with a color and style of brick and they were able to work with us seamlessly to get it ordered and have it placed. We can't stop smiling at how awesome the work looks.  So happy we did pavers. Highly recommended!<//review>

I've been impressed with System Pavers throughout the process of my backyard landscaping project. Working with Albert has been a pleasure. We have been in regular communication since the original quote and he has provided numerous ideas and examples to elevate our design.

Site development started this week. Mark and his team were on time, professional and have committed to seeing this project to completion in an efficient manner. It's amazing what they've been able to accomplish in only two days and I'm excited to see the finished product. Based on this team's experience and what I've seen so far, I'm confident they will execute a great backyard.</Review>

<text>Extremely happy with System pavers! We used the
Ones from sacramento.
We had a blank slate and had no idea what we wanted with the little space we had- so Mike came up with zones/design, then they have a dedicated Project manager, ours was Mark who ensured everything on the plan/design was executed to our heart’s desires (!!!).
We,of course had a few things changed up after the initial design but everything went smoothly-...
Here and there they would ask to verify if the design /color was correct , which I truly appreciated (we had a project in the past from other contractors go wrong).
Everything was great, smooth , on time and backed with a 25 year warranty! Can’t beat that!
Thank you! Finishing touches are on going and hope to post photos with the full /finished yard!<//text>< gmapID>

After the pool was completed we wanted to have artificial turf installed because it cuts down on dust and the maintenance of having real grass is endless. We could not find anyone to do our job, as we had called numerous contractors.
Finally my wife heard about System Pavers and I immediately called. They came out quickly and gave us an estimate that was in our budget. Bill was very easy to work with and assured us that our project was going to turn out great, and it sure has. Before the installers came to do their work Zaak the project manager came over to go over the details. He listened and helped us through the pre installation and knew exactly what to do. He represented System Pavers professionally and has a great attitude. I knew we had contracted with the right company. Finally the results speak for themselves. We are in amazement of what our backyard has become and the turf really tied everything in. Our backyard oasis is finally complete thanks to System pavers, Bill and Zakk.

<username>MrBrcarls<//username><Review>I was very pleased with the quality of work and amount of time it took to do our new pavers and turf. Zakk our project manager was very communicative with us the whole time. There was a delay in our start due to Covid causing some backups with the rock yard but he kept me informed and did everything he could to get it done. They ended up getting it done sooner than I expected and worked with me to help ensure I got in a pergola I was working on at the same time. Highly recommend.< /Review>< pictures>

<UserId.>111058908457349319617</UserId.><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Our experience with System Pavers was exceptional from beginning to end.  It started with Mr. Albert Hagan, a Senior Designer.  He arrived at the scheduled time ready to go to work.  He was friendly, professional and paid attention to our design ideas.  Mr. Hagan described the products available and made suggestions as to what would best fit our needs. He stayed as long as was needed to complete the design, walk us through the installation process and complete the paperwork.  At no time was there any pressure or up selling.

As the installation date drew near, the project manager, Beau came by and reviewed the job with us and again explained the installation process.  Again very friendly and professional.

On the day of the installation, Joe and Antolin from Azteca A.J. Landscaping arrived with their crew and went right to work.  Our old deck was removed, and excavation was begun.  During the excavation, a sprinkler line that no one knew was there was discovered.  Antolin explained our options and rerouted the line prior to the gravel being laid.  Throughout the installation, the crew was polite and professional, answering my questions without hesitation.  The entire installation took 3 days in stead of the 5 days we expected.  The crew were perfectionists and paid attention to every detail.  The crew would not leave until the job was done to our satisfaction.

We highly recommend System Pavers for your future landscaping needs.  They are truly an exceptional company.</Review><username>Tim Landrus</username><gmap_id>0x809add3e9100267f:0x16a900d654598ea0< /gmap_id>< Pics>

<UserId.>102212750029965035298<//UserId.><Review>I purchased a darling little home with dirt for a driveway and chips for a front yard.  I contacted four different companies about having pavers done in my driveway and chose System Pavers based on the company's reputation, longevity and other research.  As a customer big on service and delivery, I come away quite pleased and very much impressed.  From beginning to end, I was made to feel valued as a customer.  Tara, who handled the administrative side of the job was incredibly friendly and just a joy to work with.  BK, who managed the work to be done at my home, was very precise and knowledgeable in previewing and following up with his crew led by Mario who did an excellent job.  The whole project was orchestrated professionally and with great courtesy and politeness.  At each step of the job, I was updated on what was to be done and my approval was important.  Mario and his crew of three worked very well together, kept the job site clean, and conducted the project with excellent precision.  Not very many homes in my area have pavers, so to observe my neighbors and passer-by stop to admire the job start to finish made me feel so proud.  The finished product is well laid, sturdy,  and the gradation is barely noticeable given the gradual slope.  The bricks match my home and Gary was masterful at helping me decide shapes, patterns, and colors that I wanted to work with.  Thank you all at System Pavers !!  I hope to have more work done with your company in the future as my home ideas come together.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< pictures>

I needed a retaining wall in my backyard and wanted to go with a reputable company so I decided to go with System Pavers.  I am very happy with the result.  they also installed pavers along the side yard and the work is not only very sturdy, but aesthetically pleasing.  The workers were also very courteous, professional, and clean.  Thank you so much!<//text>

I was first introduced to System Pavers at the Cal Expo Global Winter Wonderland in January 2017. I was given a brochure and they took my name and phone number. My appointments were worked around “my schedule.”
I met with Matt Burton their Senior Design Consultant. He easily worked with us to decide what my husband and I wanted done to our front yard.  He made recommendations that were spot on with what we needed. We were offered some New Year discounts that brought our total down to an agreeable place.
My husband and I have hired numerous companies over the years and tend to be extremely cautious because we’ve been burnt by salesman offering us the moon; but not delivering because it wasn’t written in detail on the contract. We found ourselves emailing and calling Matt to make sure everything was going to happen as was promised. Matt did not disappoint!
As soon as it stopped raining, System Pavers was on the job! Our Project Manager Jeff Chappell let us know that his job wasn’t done until we were totally happy with the results. Their teams of workers were Geno and Richard. They worked extremely hard and got our yard prepared for the pavers (Classic Cobble in Grey Charcoal Tan) and SP Triad-B Turf. These two men removed muddy ground for two days to give our previously too steep yard a more balanced look.
Every day that Geno and Richard came out miracles would happen! They worked extremely hard and made huge results daily! As I told them, they did in two days what would have taken me months to do all on my own! Geno asked questions along the way to make sure everything was done to our satisfaction. He even built a pedestal for our statue we decided to put in the yard. Everything was done above and beyond our expectations!
During the process Jeff would call and come by to make sure everything was going good. Tara K., the Construction Coordinator was extremely nice dealing with us over the phone. Overall, the project came out beautifully. We have gotten so many compliments from our smiling neighbors (who know their home values will also improve).
As I said earlier, we were a little weary because of our previous experiences. It was such a joy to have the results we were promised! We did check out System Pavers before we signed. They have been in business for 25 years and are rated with an “A” with the B.B.B. They warranty their work (Pavers have a 25 year warranty and is transferrable if we ever decide to sell our home). The Turf has a 15 year warranty.
The entire project was done in a very timely manner. They always cleaned up by the end of their workday (even street gutters were swept and washed). Everyone was professional and easy to work with. They made us feel like we are part of their family. I would highly recommend this group of people and their company.<//text>

So I must start this review by saying when my husband first wanted Pavers I didn’t get it. It seemed more expensive than concrete and I didn’t understand the difference. Once I walked out on my new patio I TOTALLY GOT IT! The patio is beautiful with such character and quality. IT feels totally solid but I know it will last forever. Not only did I love the outcome but the process was truly impressive. While we had a few changes and adjustments along the way I got to see what service really meant from our team. Our Designer Craig, our project manager Mark and our install team lead by Baldo all made it possible. Initially we had a confusion with the design and they stepped up and just fixed everything. We had an issue with the date and had to push it and they couldn’t be more accommodating. We finally got to the actual install and im sure these poor guys thought they were in the clear….but not quite. They started to pull the stones into the back yard and had to stop Baldo and say it wasn’t the color I wanted. Without a second’s hesitation he had the whole crew stopped and the Mark on the phone to make sure my back yard was exactly what I wanted. They pushed double time and had it all switched in a matter of days. Its service like that that gives me no hesitation to recommend them. Every project an have its hiccups but this team will make it all run smoothly. Thank you all for your help my dog cooper, my husband and I are all thrilled with our new outdoor living space.< /text>

Phillip Olivas was helpful, thoughtful, and thorough from the get go, Mark (the project manager) checked in regularly, stopping by the house nearly every day, and Isaac, the mason, was absolutely incredible. We really can't say enough about the full team, but really were thrilled with Isaac and his team. They were always on time, often early, and worked incredibly hard all day. They answered all of our questions, made excellent recommendations to make everything look even better, and helped us think through other parts of our project. We are incredibly happy with our experience with Systems Pavers overall.</text>< username>

Loving my backyard. Can't wait for COVID to be over so I can have gatherings and show off my new backyard. For now, my toddler is loving walking or running around the backyard without worrying about tripping from the old slimy cement I once had. Yay pavers!

I worked with Jim, Frank, and Beau. First, Jim has a good vision which helps as most customers like me only know they want pavers and how much I can afford (though never tell contractors that). He measured the area, went over the colors and design, etc. Frank kept me in the loop on the schedule and Beau took care of me during the whole project. I am truly thankful for Beau as he worked with my last minute additions (sitting wall and lights). I mean I literally woke up and thought hmm "lights" and  here I go texting Beau. I think since my budget was limited, Jim just gave me what was most important to me and he truly stretched what I can reach with my budget.

The guys who worked on the pavers are like miracle workers, I mean I went to get a quick fast food brunch drive-thru and when I came back, the old stuff was mostly all taken down and its only been an hour or so. What they can do in 2-3 days was unimaginable. Yes, thats all the time it took and no they did not cut corners as I was observing the process from time to time. It was like HGTV live for me (I mean we all watch "Property Brothers" and the such but to see it in person was very entertaining). Yes, there was no way I could have DIY this backyard project and I wouldn't want to.

When it was all done, I was very happy. I'm also impressed by the warranty as when it started raining after a month and I discovered small area pooling water. I texted Beau and low and behold, I was penciled in very fast and it was fixed by the time it rained the next time. Their knowledge on how to fix problems was very helpful especially to someone like me who would leave things to professionals but watch so I can learn from their experiences.

To make my backyard better, I hired a tree removal company to remove a tree that was producing berries that started to stain my new pavers (Oh h*ll no). Unfortunately, the tree removal company cracked a brick and no they didn't tell me, I can just see some type of scratch mark on it and it wasn't the evening before they came. I knew it wasn't covered on the warranty but asked Beau if they can come and fix it. I was willing to pay but they were so nice that they came and fixed it for me for free. I think they felt bad as they knew my plans of how I wanted to show off my new pavers but with COVID, plans were still on hold. They have pride on their work, that small cracked brick would ruin the unveiling. Haha. Thank goodness. Yay, System Pavers.</Text>

My husband and I contacted System Pavers to enlarge our backyard patio. Phillip, BK and his crew did an awesome job! After the presentation and drawings of what our patio would look like from Phillip we signed a contract. Since signing the contract we had many changes (add this, take this away, etc) and these guys we great! They adapted to all of our requests and never gave us a hard time about making changes. Any time we had any questions we could call/text Phillip or BK and they got back to us right away, we never had to ask more than 1 time. BK gave suggestions and he thought about the future (10 yrs from now) so that we will not run into issues and I appreciate that very much. This is a stand up company and they have a wonderful warranty/guarantee to go along with it. You get what you pay for and so far I am extremely happy and plan to go back for my pool deck a couple years from now!< /Text>

Jim, B.K., and the System Pavers' work crew were all exceptional! Very professional, thorough, and hard working. We appreciated the project suggestions along the way and believe it made our finished product even better than we had hoped! BK supervised the job with an eagle eye to ensure we were completely satisfied with the outcome - and we were! The highly-skilled crew were attentive to detail and a pleasure to have around. We will definitely recommend them to our neighbors and friends.</Text>

If you are considering this company to do work on your home, you will not be sorry.   System Pavers was STELLAR throughout my entire project.  From start to finish, they handled every issue with concern for me and my needs.  I left the design in their hands and could not be happier with the finished product.  I don't plan to sell my home, but if I did, I'm sure the beautiful driveway would be a big selling feature.  It has made such a fantastic difference in the curb appeal of my home.  I did it for me and love pulling into my driveway or walking out to get the mail.  No ugly cracks... it matches my colors and just looks amazing. Many weeks later, I still have people stop to say how nice it looks and I see people slow down and look at it.   If you go with S.P. ... you will not be sorry.  Matt my salesman and "BK" Amenwerth, my project manager were awesome.  Ask for them  :)</review>

Beautiful job... great experience.  Alex is the best.  She is the designer and because she really listened to me and worked to find a plan that would fit my vision and my budget, we now have a fantastic backyard space to relax and enjoy.  I posted a before pic of our townhouse's small backyard.  it was a mess.  The work crew, led by Paolo, came in and were quick, knowledgeable, friendly professional.  Four other guys came out... Alfredo, Gerardo and Nacho, to ensure the job got done in short time and beat the rain.  I love, love, love my new backyard space.  it's not finished yet and I'm already thinking of phase II things I want system pavers to put in for us... more pavers, lighting, pergolas, seating, bbq.  The project manager, Adam, came out and inspected and advised prior and all during.  BK, the project lead, was fantastic.  The professionalism and the people are what sold me.  The fact that the product is great and the workmanship guaranteed for 25. years is utterly unheard of... I'm so pleased.  The management should know that the people are what sold me... they all obviously love their jobs and their company and care about their workmanship and their customers.</review>

We had a fantastic experience with System Pavers! Their sales representative Mike explained everything and took the time to meet us at the showroom as well as multiple times at our home!  Can’t say enough about Frankie and his crew!  Exceptional quality in their work!  Gino was extremely helpful and always took our requests and exceeded them!  Tara in the office was always available which made the whole process run smooth!   We couldn’t have asked for more in our project!</Text>

Bill came out first and spent as much time as we needed to discuss design.  There were several promotions going on that helped make our project fit a budget.  It didn't take long to get a crew out here to do the work and they were great. We especially appreciated Ty
laying out a few pavers in different patterns to help us make some final design choices.  BK put it all together and there were no surprise expenses or extra fees because he made sure we had enough materials to complete the job. We love our beautiful paver walkway!<//text>

<text>My husband met BK in the grocery store about 7 years ago and asked him some questions. He handed me his card and I called him this week with questions about a project. He was kind enough to stay on the phone with me for over 25 minutes and answer the questions I had. He gave suggestions and pointers on a DIY project. I'd place him in the super incredible guy category for all the time he spent with me. I'd hire him in a flash!

I am now a raving fan of system pavers and have already started on new ideas of what could be possible in our home. On a scale of 0-4 I would give JR and his team a 4++!  Bill, JR, Leo(and his team), Bo and Lonnie all were amazing to work with.   All the people we interacted with and the work that was completed is top notch. I know I am very hard to please but all work completed and my interactions have far surpassed my expectations. Any questions were quickly addressed and any ideas were made possible.  Great job system pavers!</Review>

Thank you for an exceptional backyard and wonderful project experience from start to completion, System Pavers. We worked with Mike to design our project. He went over and beyond to assist us in our decision making around including a fountain feature in the backyard. Mike also made it a simple process when selecting our stone pavers and turf. Once designed and contract signed, the project started and ended as scheduled. We worked with Mark, Project Manager to plan site adjustments. Mark also helped in the design process, coaching us through layout changes and the use of our space. He even built a custom fountain from a vase we purchased separately. He followed through on every promise. Alejandro and son installed our pavers, sitting wall, and turf. Amazing work and we are very pleased with the beautiful outcome. They even left a drip line connected to our existing irrigation for the planter. The business office staff were also very helpful and friendly.</Review>

Our designer, Scott, provided an estimate for a walkway in our backyard. Initially, it was way over our budget but he worked with us to remove some of the pavers to keep the cost down. Our project manager, Mark, made sure everything was done correctly and made sure we were happy. The job was completed quickly. We love our new walkway!<//text>

System Pavers recently completed our backyard and side yard renovation.  The team who worked on our project was very professional and always available to answer any questions.  The work was completed in a timely manner and the quality of the work is excellent.  We look forward to using System Pavers for future projects and highly recommend this company.< /Review>

I cannot say enough great things about Systems Pavers and Frank.  Everything from his  customer service to the top notch quality of his team’s work was exceptional!  Anyone who has just spent a lot of money on their new home can understand being apprehensive about spending additional monies toward landscaping, but I’m certainly glad I did and that I chose Systems Pavers to do the work.  Their responsiveness, timeliness, and work product cannot be beat! If you are looking for a company to get your backyard looking great, I highly recommend them!<//text>

We are so happy with our new System Pavers patio!  To be honest, there were a few misunderstandings during the initial pricing and design and we were not sure we wanted to move forward.  But System Pavers went above and beyond to make sure our concerns were met and we are glad we did.  Our project was relatively small compared to a lot, but Mark put the same care and effort into our patio that I am sure would have went into full backyard project.  We now have a beautiful patio that totally changes the look and feel of our back yard.  We plan on expanding the patio in the next few years and we fully expect to have System Pavers do the job.</review>

I had such a great experience with System Pavers. The crew foreman Mario and his guys were the best and my project manager BK was so professional and helpful throughout the process. They built a patio with a gorgeous cover and handled all the details. Miguel built a beautiful custom waterfall and Systems also did all the landscape lights too. Everything has a remote.

I will start out by saying, I'm a natural skeptic but don't judge me, I'm working on that!

BK and his crew were nothing short of great!  The precision in which he and his crew used to line and level things out was seriously impressive!
He and the crew were precise and knowledgeable. That became apparent right away.

Regarding reliability, they were here when they said they would be and worked day after day until the project was complete. Minus the weekends. Hey, everyone needs time off!

Anyway, in all, it took about two weeks (with weather delays) to complete the project. Again, very impressed!

I could also rave about the quality of work for days and days but the thing that impressed me the most about BK and his crew was the communication.

They delivered on everything they stated would be done. I highly recommend System Pavers, BK and crew!!< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>We were hesitant to reach out to System Pavers, since we knew they were high-quality builders, and were afraid it might be too expensive.  Kyle came out, and creatively communicated our options given our budget, and he put together a beautiful design within our budget.  Mark, our project manager was incredibly helpful and supportive through the building process, making sure that our patio turned out exactly how we wanted it.  Priority #1 was our satisfaction.  Alejandro and the building team were very friendly.  He talked in great detail about the plans and confirmed all of the details with us as it was built.  Any unexpected roadblocks that came up, the team was quick to put our needs first and make it right.  Can't say enough good about our experience - highly recommended!<//review>< UserId.>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>We love our newly paved backyard thanks to System Pavers. Mike was our sales rep and made the decision process very easy. He was available any time we had questions. JR was in charge of the installation and was so flexible with us since we had to put the project on hold briefly while we made some changes. Everyone we worked with was very accommodating and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. The installation was done is only three days and right before Christmas. Now we can't wait to get outside and start enjoying our backyard!< /text>< pictures>

Two summers ago we had them put in a patio for us; we were not very happy with the results.  Some of the lines were not straight and the bricks were cut at odd angles.  I called the company to tell them to stop sending me literature as I would not refer anyone to them. The girl on the phone said let me have a project manager call you.  Well, Jeff did give me a call and came out to look at our patio.  He was just as disappointed as we were and apologized for the work.  He was not the project manager on the job the first time and informed us that person had been let go.  He took his pictures back to the company and they came up with a solution and repaired the patio at no charge.  We are very happy with the solution and the work.  We can enjoy our patio now without noticing the unusual angles and poor work.  Thanks to Jeff and System Pavers for making it look professional.  We really like it.</Text>

We had a great experience with System Pavers!  Pete Bachelor was incredible in helping us.  He brought out a weed whacker and knocked down weeds for us (incredible!).  And Frankie, the job manager went way beyond the call of duty.  I was out of the country when the job was actually done.  He came out--when I got home--and did several things to satisfy my requests.  He (for example) fixed our water lines--in the process, repairing some work that another previous company screwed up!  These guys are fantastic!  They gave us the best bid, and really worked to make us happy!< /Text>

<Review>The paving job was done skillfully and on time. Unfortunately I was not observant enough to spot that many of the paving stones contained pits (small holes). I made what turned out to be a mistake, paying the whole amount for the job, even though the company offered the option of spreading payments over three months. Every attempt to have the company representatives to come out to have a look failed. In other words, their after-sales service is abysmal. If you employ this company, I strongly recommend you use the extended payment method. That way you have some leverage if attention to the completed job is needed.< /Review>< rate>

I have nothing but great things to say about my experience with System Pavers. From the initial design and quote, Drew Walter really went the extra mile to walk through all of my options and ensure that I was going to love my new backyard. BK Ammenwerth and his team completed the job quickly and without any problems. Thanks to all of their hard work my backyard looks amazing!!</Review>

We used System Paving 14 years ago for our front and back yards, they did a wonderful job. I just had to call them for a small fix, and I was contacted by Dan Burnham who handled the job wonderfully. He stayed in constant contact with me and had the job done within a few days. I highly recommend them to anyone wanting pavers.</Text>

System Pavers did an masterly job on our patio. They assisted with the design. They showed us the full range of possibilities on the product so that we could make the best selection. Even though we were a relatively small job, they made sure we were satisfied with the outcome, and we are more than satisfied. Our project manager, BK Ammenwerth was particularly attentive to our project, coming twice before we began to make sure that all of our needs were going to be met. When the installation began, BK and Charles and the whole crew were wonderful to work with. They were easy to talk to and knowledgeable. We could ask any of them questions about the process. Their attention to detail was exceptional. The final product surpasses our expectations. We are very happy that we chose System Pavers.< /text>

Frankie Gori and Ryan Harvey of System Pavers have been absolutely amazing, both in design, completion, and during and after the job to always be there and respond to me.  First, the design was absolutely amazing, and Ryan took the time to really dial in every detail.  Then Frankie took over and took complete ownership to make sure the job was completed as designed.  He took everything so personal and made sure the work was perfect, and it is.  I absolutely LOVE my backyard, and of course so does everyone else!  It was not cheap, but it sure is worth it.  Now I feel like I'm on vacation every single day!  Thank you so much Frankie and Ryan!<//Text>

<text>Been wanting to redo my driveway for years, but kept putting it off. But recently I was visiting my grandparents and their neighbors had used System Pavers to have their driveway and walkway replaced and I couldn't believe how amazing it looked. I immediately got their information and worked with Bradford to design a driveway and walkway to my house that perfectly matched the color of my house, plus, I also ended up working with him to re-do my yard as that was the next item on my list after redoing the driveway, so I killed two birds with one stone.

BK was the project manager and one of the nicest guys I've had the pleasure of working with, especially having been a homeowner of almost 9 years now and several construction projects, including residing my house and adding stone veneer (hence making sure the color combo of the driveway matched the house colors).

The project was slightly delayed due to rainy weather, which for obvious reasons you certainly can't fault System Pavers for, since installation can't be done in the rain. That being said, as soon as the weather cleared up, they were immediately on the job and the work was completed at an astounding rate. After the third day I was already parking on my new, amazing driveway.

I've worked hard to make my house the best looking one on the block, and System Pavers certainly pushed that way over the edge. I still have a back yard I have to decide what I'm going to do with in the long run, but I have a feeling whatever I decide, System Pavers will be involved in that that project when the time comes.

Thank you, Bradford and BK. You're the the best!<//text>< pictures>

<review>I can't say enough about the amazing transformation that System Pavers did with my backyard! Mia worked with me to create a plan for my yard that matched both my needs (games, fire pit area, BBQ space) and my personality (low maintenance turf, and a cool layout for everything). Shiloh is an incredibly attentive and professional project manager. He kept me updated on the team's progress and what to expect each day. He made sure I was informed every step of the way, and made himself available to work around my schedule. Adam has a true passion for delivering excellent customer service, and helping people create their dream yard. The level of talent, skill and professionalism of the team at System Pavers is simply unparalleled!< /review>< pictures>

Our project manager, Jeff Chappell has a great crew to work with.  He was attentive, communicative and followed up every step of the way.  He is a great asset to the System Pavers team. And Brandon and his team who constructed the pergola did a great job too.  We are looking forward to enjoying our new back yard for many years to come.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>We just had System Pavers install a retaining wall and stairs on our very steep, rocky hill in El Dorado Hills.  BK, Paolo and their team delivered a backyard that exceeded our expectations - it's absolutely beautiful.  The work was well executed, they kept us informed of all challenges (boulders!) and how they planned to address these issues, and did this all on schedule.

We've used System Pavers three times - to install a patio, then grass and a fire pit, and now the wall and stairs.  We highly recommend this company.  Thanks BK, Paolo and the team for a beautiful yard!

System Pavers recently installed my new driveway.  I am totally pleased with  the outcome as well as the service from the entire System Pavers Team.

Phillip, Senor Design Specialist, spent a great deal of time explaining the process, offering suggestions and ensuring all my questions were answered.

BK, Project manager took over and ensured everything ran smoothly and kept in constant contact throughout the project.  He was always communicative and flexible.  Both Phillip and BK gave me confidence in System Pavers ability to get the job done right!

The Team that actually did the demolition and installation, led by Paulo, were outstanding.  Paulo, Nacho, Alex and Javie worked like a well oiled machine.  They  were prompt, professional and were extremely accurate and precise ( a necessity when installing pavers) .   Paulos experience and suggestions helped enhance the overall outcome.  They finished the job quickly and went above and beyond to ensure satisfaction.  There was no disruption to the existing landscape.

Many thanks to the entire team for a friendly, professional experience and a job well done. I think these people like their jobs!< /Review>

Nothing but positive experiences with System Pavers for our backyard. Jim our designer was professional and patient with us as we designed our  backyard to meet HOA requirements. Through multiple drafts he was always eager to help and do whatever was needed to make us happy as customers. He was prompt, polite, and easy to work with.  Once the project got underway, BK our project manager couldn't have been any better. You can tell he knows his stuff and makes clear and helpful recommendations to make your project go smoothly. BK kept us in the loop and was always available for us. BK went to bat for us with the HOA and took on some of the bothersome work I would have otherwise had to do, so that was great. Our yard was done by Geno and his crew. They we dedicated hard workers. I couldn't believe the amount or work it took.  They are truly craftsman. They completed all the work themselves and the results are amazing. If you are considering System Pavers I highly recommend them.  Being a bit of a control type A person I was nervous at first. Once I trusted the process, everything came out better than expected.  Couldn't be happier. Cant wait for spring!< /Text>

System Pavers is customer focused and driven to do quality work with excellent follow through. Everyone we dealt with for our project from Deric Williams in sales, Adam and Tara, to Frank Gori for project oversight were awesome. We love all of the usable space in our yard and enjoy sitting out enjoying the fire pit in the evenings.<//Review>

System Pavers did my backyard a little over a year ago.  Recently, I noticed there's an issue with the AC pad in the yard.  However, in order for the repair to be done on the pad, the surrounding pavers would have to be removed.  Chris immediately came out to assess the situation and said he would coordinate with the other company to make sure the repair is done correctly.  Chris is very professional, courteous and efficient.  He kept me apprised of the repair status at all times.  His team did an excellent job putting the pavers back in and they look like new again.  System Pavers stand by its promises and its customers always come first.  This is what I call A+ customer service.  Thanks, Chris!<//review>

<text>It’s been a great experience dealing with System Pavers ( from Georgia Petersen, Design Consultant to Frank Gori, Project Manager).

I am very satisfied with the service provided. They are very attentive to detail, and professional from the beginning to the end of the project....Frank has listened and answered any of my concerns and returned all of my text and phone calls right away.

The experience dealing with Frank Gori has been phenomenal and I felt like he treated me not only as his customer but also as family.  My husband and I are very happy and well satisfied.  We would definitely recommend to family and friends.  Thank you Frank!!!!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

After signing to contract early December, I was contacted by the project manager the day before the start date (per the contract) and the crew started exactly as scheduled on 12/27/16. The whole project took three weeks due to the rain, but the crew was able to stop at good break points. The project manager kept in constant contact and kept me informed at all times. We negotiated a hard completion date of 1/19/17 and this crew, despite the weather, completed ( including the clean-up) our project two days early. The crew not only was friendly toward us, but they genuinely were fond of each other and worked very well together. The end result exceeded our expectation and we cannot be more pleased. I recommend System Pavers for all of your landscape needs.</review>< pictures>

We are finally finished with our beautiful backyard, and have System Pavers to thank for it.  The project was broken up into three phases, and we had three different project managers; Adam, CK, and Frank - all terrific guys, and a pleasure to work with.  The crews are professional, courteous, and super hard working.   When we are ready to start on the front yard, we want will definitely call Jerry Cook, our Sales/Design guy.  Jerry takes our dreams, puts them into a plan, and the Project Managers and work crews make our dreams reality.  Thank you System Pavers, Signa and Michael Duffell</Text>

This company is our favorite contractor. We called them up when Sacramento County required us make a change to our courtyard. The company quickly assigned us a great project lead (Franke Gori) who developed a solution to meet the county’s requirements. He then assigned the person (Mario Rubalcava) to complete the work. Franke also handled explaining to Mario what the final product had to accomplish. All work was quickly. completed. Mario maintained a very neat work site and the final result was amazing. Franke came back when Mario was done to make sure we were happy with the result. We will continue to highly recommend System Pavers to our friends and family in need of installation of pavers. The was an excellent experience.< /Text>

<Text>The people at System Pavers have all been professional and kind, great to work with. The designer Chris was a delight to have over, to draw up his ideas and give us a quote. Once we were going forward with their services, project manager BK was our go-to man, who answered all my questions and concerns promptly, driving over more than once when speaking in person was preferable. The foreman, Adalton, was hard-working, organized, and friendly, and he and his crew quickly built us this fabulous patio, firepit, and grassy area. They are pricey, and you get what you pay for. Most contractors keep in touch until the job is done and then don't come back to fix anything. System Pavers has a reputation for follow through and great quality.</Text>< gmap_id>

I am totally delighted with my new patio created by System Pavers.  It is beautiful!  It was done efficiently-everyone involved was very professional.  The project was done in 2 1/2 days-no muss and no fuss.  I was very pleased with with design consultant Ryan Harvey, and project managers BK Ammenwerth  and Steve Xeonos, and all the work crew.  It was expensive but I highly recommend Systems Pavers!<//review>

System Pavers did a big backyard project for us - new outdoor fire pit with accent lighting, new BBQ with island, and paver decking along with a matching mow strip along our lawn. The finished project is just what we imagined. BK Ammersmith was our project manager and listened to every question we had about the project.<//Text>

The boys at system pavers have done a fantastic job.  I had a driveway installed about 10 years ago but the city of Auburn regrated my road which caused water to run much more heavily to my side of the road.  BK came out and gave me a bid on a culvert and I decided to have it done.  I had to wait a while but BK came out with his crew of Mario and Teno and such.  The work was very well done and it solved my runoff problem.  They also fixed a few things for me as well.  I'm getting old and I sure appreciate honest people and good work.< /Review>

I used System Pavers for the design and installation for the front, courtyard and backyard for a new home in El Dorado Hills. It was a large scope of work, including demolition of existing concrete in the courtyard and backyard covered patio areas, 3 separate waterfall features, a firepit, artificial turf, covered pergola and extensive amount of hardscape with pavers.

I am more than pleased with the finished work, exceeding my expectations in many ways. At the design phase, the designer really listened and understood the overall look and feel I was looking for. The first draft design he came back with was excellent, taking all of my jumbled mess of ideas and turning it into a beautiful, cohesive design. The cost estimate for the design was above my overall budget but System Pavers worked with me patiently to modify the plans while still maintaining the integrity of the original design in order to fit my budget.

Once work on the project began, I was impressed with the efficiency of the work crew. The project manager kept me well informed throughout the process and the crew worked quickly but with precision. The design of my yard is linear with clean lines and a modern feel. It was important to keep all the various elements precisely aligned. They did an excellent job making sure that all the various elements aligned perfectly. Even when I modified the design slightly during construction on one section of the yard, System Pavers accommodated my change and the end result they produced were even better than the change I was envisioning.

My sincere thanks to everyone at System Pavers for delivering on my dream yard. I highly recommend them.< /text>

Hi eveyone, my son found system pavers on Craigslist. First meeting we had was with Mike, very nice guy. Give us a very good deal and then had the best meeting with BK. Every concern I had was happily addressed. Gave more ideas and is willing to help out in every possible way, feel proud to have my backyard done by  System Pavers. Thank you for taking the time to ensure a positive experience!</text>

<Text>Though I am pleased with the work I am not pleased with the ethical standards this company goes by. Our sales person (who no longer works for them) failed to disclose to us that the awesome government funded loan would end in a lien on our home for the sum way over what we paid or owe. He told us some sob story on how he almost lost his home trough being taken advantage of by a former partner. Gaining our trust we electronically signed on his iPad, skimming, "sign here and here," distract tactic,  "we will pick out your pavers next," "sign here and here", distract.. "what color pergola are you thinking?" distract.. sign here. Please understand we take responsibility in this. We signed right? That does not mean that other factors did not come into play. They over price their products because it is a government funded loan. They set you up with a finance company that not only puts a lien on your home but only excepts payments twice a year and the payment can not be less than $2500. (Calfirst program.)( Renewal financial company.) making it harder to pay on the principal.  They state your payment will be approximately 360/month. Sure that's about what it is broken down. It actually comes out of your escrow!! Twice a year when your taxes are due.  I kept wondering where my monthly bill was. Thank God I was smart enough to set the money aside because others that have been caught up in this glorified loan have not. Upping their mortgage payment close to $1000 a month. Potentially losing their homes over this. If it had be disclosed to us that a lien would be placed on your home outloud to us there is no way we would have went this route. Please beware of the unethical practices of this company. Do not sell your soul to the devil for an upgrade. You too could be stuck right where we are today. Trying to better our circumstances only to come to a lien being held over our heads. Read up on this. Look at all the articles. This is no joke and any company willing to sell out their customers for the mighty dollar should be called out.< /Text>< pics>

We are extremely pleased with our new driveway and walkway done by System Pavers. From our first meeting with Chris Murray, Senior Designer, who outlined a perfect plan, to our Project Manager, Bradford Seguine, who promised us the moon and delivered! Beautiful addition to our home. Highly recommend working with these individuals. Very professional and detailed oriented. John and Susan Sobelman Napa, CA<//review>

System Pavers just completed our second paver project. This project was a front walkway with stairs and a small front patio. The project manager, BK Ammenwerth, did an excellent job helping to plan the job and ensured that the project was completed the way we wanted. The crew worked with us during  the project and did an excellent job. We would recommend System Pavers to anyone planning a paver project.< /review>

<Text>From the design to the installation of my patio pavers it was an excellent experience. The installation team did an outstanding job of following the plans to create just what I was expecting. The follow-up by the Project Manager (Jeff Chappell) was timely and appreciated. My patio pavers look magnificent and several of my neighbors came to see the finished work. I would definitely recommend System Pavers. Their customer service is superior and absolutely a 5 star experience.</Text>< rating>

<Text>System Pavers completed our backyard renovation Dec 2017 and we could not be happier with the results. They installed pavers, waterfall feature and pergola.
Everyone we dealt with at SP was incredibly knowledge, professional, pleasant and courteous.  A rarity to have and maintain all of those qualities in business these days.
From our designer Lance Alicaya – to our Project Manager BK Ammenwerth – Adanto and his paver crew to Miguel the Master Mason/artisan who built our waterfall – they delivered exactly what they promised and more!   They were very detailed in their work, explaining each step of the process, and made recommendations when and where needed.   The quality of materials used and the pride in their work is superior. The cleaned up the site at the end of each day.
Even after all the work was completed, I had questions for both BK & Miguel. They got back to me in a timely fashion. Miguel even came back to the house for a checkup on the waterfall. I cannot say enough about all of these people.  They are amazing!
We would highly recommend System Pavers for any patio, yard, and driveway work.  You will not be disappointed.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>112115447162602965925<//userid><Name>Karla Randle< /Name>< Date>

System Pavers did a SUPER job with our backyard! From the first engagement with Chris Murray who drove all the way to meet us TWICE was very impressive!

As for the project team who actually came in to do the work, man oh man.... they were the "service crew extraordinaire!!!!" BK Ammenwerth and his team leader, Mario, were PHENOMENAL!!!!

They were very detailed in their work, they explained each step of the process, made some recommendations on adjustments to keep the integrity of the design nice, pretty and clean-cut!

What stood out for us was their actual "CARE" for the work they were doing. We've worked with other folks before but these guys actually take PRIDE in their work, which made all the difference! They were thorough and very patient with our questions and requests. Man, they even kept the job site clean and in order at the end of the day, everyday!

If you guys want a great design, superb worksmanship, beautiful results and most of all - PLEASANT people to work with who put CUSTOMER's needs and happiness high on their agenda - look no further! System Pavers is the company of choice!

Chris, BK, Mario and the rest of the team - UDABEST guys! Simply THE BEST!< /text>

BK Ammenwerth and Paulo Almieda are the best ever!!

We really want to express our gratitude for an amazing transformation in our backyard by System Pavers!  BK was attentive to our questions and his crew chief Paulo was delightful and worked so hard to complete an exceptional quality backyard.

I would recommend BK Ammenwerth and Paulo Almieda to all my friends and family!!

Drew Walter the Design consultant schedule an appointment with us and was on time to discuss all the design options through the sketch. He showed us different color pavers to select from and gave us an estimate as per our budget. We were impressed with his professional experience. He was very patient and calm to answer all our questions related to the project. We were happy to sign the contract with the System Pavers.

BK Ammenwerth the Project Manager and his skilled team started the project on time. BK is and excellent supervisor. With his experience he can visualize the work very fast and he knows his job well. He didn't say say NO to any job we asked him to do. We were very comfortable to work with him and his team. They finished the job before time, cleaned and washed the back yard before they left.
We would not hesitate to recommend System Pavers if any body is looking for a good job to be done whether big or small.

<Text>This review is for System Pavers Project Manager Frank Gori.

I had some warranty work that needed to be done with paver work that had been installed by System Pavers. The person that responded to my call was Project Manager Frank Gori.

We looked over the work that needed to be done. After that was complete, Frank noticed that we had begun to tear out our artificial turf that had been installed by System Pavers. We have been having huge problems with smells that are coming from the turf. System Pavers had replaced the turf to try and eliminate the problem, but unfortunately that didn't work. System Pavers stated that they couldn't/wouldn't do anything further.

I explained the situation to Frank and he stated that he would do some checking and get back to us with anything he found out. He went to his superiors and explained to them the problem. He even brought one of them (Brent I believe) to the house. Brent stated that he, like Frank, didn't want us to have a bad experience with System Pavers. He offered to replace the turf at cost for us. Brent stated that there is a new turf out that may help with the problem.

To sum all this up, none of this would have happened without the diligence of Frank Gori. He was genuinely concerned about the problems we were having and our unhappiness with the situation. He went out of his way to see if there was anything that System Pavers could do to help alleviate the situation even after we had been told there was nothing further that System Pavers would do.

We were very, very pleased that Frank took the time, and the effort to assist us in getting resolution to our problem. He constantly keeps us informed as to what is happening with the situation.

These days’ customer service seems to have taken a back seat to making sure the consumer is pleased, or at least that the outcome to the problem is resolved to both parties’ satisfaction. To get complete satisfaction is not an easy thing to obtain. It was a wonderful thing that Frank did to make sure we were happy with the outcome, and that both parties we pleased with the outcome. He continues to check that the warranty work was done, and that it is holding together. He lets us know as well about the artificial turf resolution. We are truly pleased that he is our project manager and we hope to do more business with him after the turf issue is settled.

Thank you Frank! We appreciate your honesty and your outstanding efforts to help us resolve our problem.< /Text>< gmapID>

I contacted System Pavers to install patio pavers. 15 minutes from the time I was to meet their sales guy, I got a call. Sales guy not with the company any longer. Okay. Stuff happens. Next sales guy was a no show and didn’t tell me ahead of time but had a good excuse. Appointment #3, sales guy shows up but fairly late. Says many offensive remarks. Okay. I’m not very sensitive I don’t think. But he spends most of the time talking about a product I’m not buying. Probably told to do so. I had to ask what the paver pattern will be, had to ask about the border color and pattern and other essential info. He offered a crazy bid like $16,000 (average paver install is $3,000 - $5,000). Finally agreed on $8,000. He made a couple promises that I don’t think he ever meant to keep. The company redeemed themselves a little by sending a good project manager (B.K.) and doing a really good install.<//review>

While my wife and I were attending the Placer County fair, we came accross the System Pavers display and struck up a conversation with the representative. After a few minutes I set up a call back and thought nothing more. A couple weeks go by and I get a call from System Pavers asking to set up a time to come out. Initially I thought I was
going to be fed some over hyped sales pitch and be pressured into buying something more than I wanted. THIS WAS ABSOLUTLY NOT THE CASE!! System Pavers blew me away with their professionalism, courtesy, customer service, and attention to detail. Our Design Consultant Donna Denton, spent 4 hours with us on our initial consultation. She went through the entire build process from start to finish, took measurements, photos, and made a to scale drawing of our backyard expectations. When it came time for the install, our Project Manager, Jeff Chappell was mr. "Johnny on the spot" every step of the way. He kept us informed and up to date every step of the way. His crew that he brought in to knock our backyard was crazy fast and precise as well. 2 full days and I have a brand new custom patio and walkway on my home that's only 1 month old. Thank you System Pavers for doing such an amazing job.< /Text>

<review>After a number of times trying to post a review for your organization , i am now giving it my final try. am organ in the Sacto. office was a great tutor/help.
In March '16 I needed a repair done on last years project which was finally completed.This year, BRADFORD SEGUINE III, was my contact from system pavers and he discussed , in detail ,my concerns and proposed a fix with time and product descriptions. He scheduled his crew, they were here as  on time, worked hard and efficiently, completed their job. Then we had a slight rain delay before the sealer could be applied. Bradford accommodated my schedule and promptly applied the sealer and finished the job. Even moved a couple of pots which were too heavy for me. I was  very pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and promptness of the man and system pavers' completion of my project, as my experience with a number of contractors in the past few years was other than satisfactory. This is my first review of a contractor and only done because i was impressed by the employee of System Pavers who would rate 5 stars. This customer is now a "Happy Camper". Better keep him for a while. THANX BRADFORD. *****  R.M. S.<//review>< Response>

Prices are reasonable and they don't upcharge like many Russian stores in LA. Fun little trinkets and gifts are here too! The owner was super nice to me and helped me find what I wanted. I asked her questions about products and she was pleasant and helpful. I'm going to be shopping here from now on to buy my perogi, jams, spices, candies, halva, etc! It's small inside but they have all the Russian staples. So happy I found this place and glad I can support a small business!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Absolutely Russian store, 90% of all products are from Russia. There is zero Ukrainian souvenirs/products, but a lot from Russia. Nothing from Ukraine, zero! Why this store even called Ukraine?
Unfriendly service. My husband and I was looking around trying to find some spicy and sweets to buy, blonde women started accuse my husband of steeling stuff. Then make it like it’s was a “funny” joke. Seriously?
Don’t recommend this place!<//Review><user_name>Anastasiia Ponomarova<//user_name><gmap_id>0x80c2a4ca6b720fc1:0x38cf9e97566029e9< /gmap_id>< pics>

Way higher prices for the same stuff that you can buy in West Hollywood in the Russian markets there. They order everything from them by the way. The pastries sometimes are not very fresh but stale. And never ever ship anything with them. You'll be disappointed. They promise one thing and then it's completely different story. Most of the stuff is not friendly at all.</Text>

<text>A small isle of Ukraine in the heart of Santa Monica :) Come here to experience some ethnic spirit and to get some really delicious pickles and sausages! Indeed, american sausages and pickles are not at all like Russian/Ukrainian. You have to taste them to understand the difference. In fact, if you ask, the staff would be happy to cut you a little piece of any deli they have, so that you could choose. The staff are very polite and cheerful, even though they may look a bit grumpy at first - this is just a national trait of the russian character. All you have to do is to be polite yourself, tell them a story, and they would be your best friends! ;)
Once you become friends, they would always tell you whether the food you are choosing is fresh or not really and when they are expecting new deliveries or what are their own favorite products.
This is truly a very specific experience of shopping you would never get at Vons or Wholefoods!! :)< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Not very friendly staff, at least not some of them. The other staff I've seen have generally been reasonably polite, but the most recent one - a young-ish lady w/ long blond hair, essentially lied to me about the time to make me cut my shopping short and leave quickly.

I certainly expect better customer treatment; which doesn't include being rudely interrupted in my shopping & nearly kicked out when it's actually still about 10 min to closing.

I came in around a quarter till 8pm & spent 2 min choosing among the boxed candy - yes: 2. entire. minutes: how terrible of me...
The very second I turned toward the deli counter, the saleslady very pointedly & impatiently "asked" me if I was finally done & "urged" me to finish shopping, saying they were already about to close.

I thought this was quite odd since I knew I'd come in w/ plenty of time to get a few items & be out before closing, but was too polite to pull out my phone right in front of her to check the time. So I chose a couple of deli items in a hurry, while the saleslady's acting like this is all a giant inconvenience.

Then after everything got rung up & packed, & after I paid, & after I put everything in my bag, & after leaving the store; I pull out my iPhone - and what does it say? It's 7:55. Meaning it had been ~7:50 when that saleslady told me they were already closing.
Um: they close at 8pm, & they don't shut the doors early as far as I've seen on prev. visits there; or at least they're really not supposed to.

I'm a regular customer here, & I go to a lot of trouble to get here as it's not at all close to where I live, work or study & because their closing hours are a lot earlier than other grocers. Since I work & go to school it's very difficult to manage to come here when they're open: ~15 minutes before closing is the best I can do.
Despite that, I'm still always quick about it & always leave before they close. I come here almost weekly & overall I spend significant money at this very small store.

I will prob keep shopping here (due to the sheer lack of any other russian food store anywhere around), but if anyone tries to do that to me again I'm certainly not going to be too polite to pull out my phone right in front of their nose, turn the screen to them & sweetly ask 'oh, really, you're closing right now? Do you have a different time than this? Or have you changed your closing time from what's posted on your door?'

Pricing:
Their deli prices are average to high: Smoked salmon (packaged) is $14 for 11oz
Mackerel fish (whole, salted) $10+
Докторская колбаса - $8/lb., which seems questionably high to me, & it tastes unpleasantly over-salted.

A major issue, however, is that not a single item in the deli counters has a price tag on it; so you have to ask for the price on every item you might be interested in buying (& none of the salesladies are particularly cheerful about answering), & then try to figure out right away in front of them whether that's a good price for you.
It gives the whole thing an unpleasant haggling overtone & makes you embarrassed to have to ask.
& of course since it's not written down anywhere; if you forget the prices you have to keep asking about every item at every visit. Or I guess you can just accept that they're going to charge you whatever they see fit & hope you've got enough to pay your surprise-amount bill when it's presented.

Also, they're often out of many popular types & flavors of boxed candy, sometimes for weeks or months at a time: so I waste my time making multiple trips without getting what I came for. When you ask about it they kind of just say 'yeah, we don't have anymore' (in russian); nothing about when (or if) the products will ever be there again: so you don't, u know, waste endless trips trying to buy it, like I've ended up doing. Just a kind of perpetual attitude of indifference, like they can do just fine without all of their customers.

Take from this what you will. But I think the fact that they're the only Russian food grocer in the entire Westside is the ONLY thing keeping them in business.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) The dumplings cost $ 12 and are not very impressive. My boyfriend didn't even try. A man walked around the store followed us for the first time. It was unpleasant. The saleswomen speak Russian; friendly. Good selection of souvenirs. There are many other products reminiscent of the homeland. There is a nearby Tehran store. There, too, you can pick up something for tea, such as bagels.

Пельмени стоят $12 и не очень впечатляют. Мой парень даже пробовать не стал. Мужчина ходил по магазину за нами следил в первый раз. Неприятно было. Продавщицы говорят по русски; приветливые. Хороший выбор сувениров. Продуктов других много напоминающих о родине. Есть соседний магазин Техран. Там тоже можно подобрать что-то к чаю, например баранки.<//text>

It was very convenient and took about only 5 minutes. The employees were very friendly and professional. I would go back again to take care of DMV services. You beat all the inconveniences dealing with DMV offices.<//Review>

I was at Academy West Insurance the other day with a friend. I saw a sign that was telling me they could give me a better price on my car insurance. I didn't think it was possible I was already getting a low price.  But they beat it, so now I'm insured by Academy West Insurance and here to stay.

THANKS,
DONEA LEWIS<//text>

Came it to get DMV tags for my Mother's car the gentleman that help me was very professional & explained every charge to me, he also let me know all the other ways he would be able to help in the future with life, auto, home owners & renters insurance that the company has to offer. I would recommend going to see the people at this office for your tags it was a lot faster & they really care about the people they help.<//text>

I fully stand by by choice to switch because his customer service skills is the reason I chose to spend more money. Quality was what I wanted in an agent and that is exactly what I got and more. Thank you Daniel, you are the reason why anyone looking to switch insurance should come by to see for themselves.</text>< Pictures>

As the DMV are closed because of the covid19 my tags were due I really didn’t want to go thru mail and play the waiting game in getting my tags. I goggle my next step in other way to get them. Luckily academy west Insurance is in the town I live. Was in and out less than ten minutes. So I was very  happy and pleased</text>

If I can give zero stars, I would. First off, we had been trying to get ahold of their manager for 2-3 weeks with no luck. She was never at the office. And finally when we found her at her office, we were extremely unhappy with their customer service. Their agents are not qualified to properly help you, and when their agents make mistakes, their manager(Veronica Sandoval) fails to take responsibility for those mistakes. We asked for their supervisor's contact information to see if they can help us out, and Veronica the manager, refused to give us her bosses information. They would gladly take our money but they refuse to provide proper customer service. They are only here to rip people off. If your looking for insurance, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!<//review>

Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had any any retail store, Period!   The cashier let someone buy something literally out of my hand that was very valuable and rare.  The manager said it was theirs to sell to anyone that pays first no matter who is in possession of that item.  I felt like I was robbed.  I can’t believe this happened.  I would have never thought a store would treat their customers so poorly

Response to Owner’s response - you’re employees are NOT telling you the truth.  I never told anyone I did not want the stereo.  Myself or my wife were touching the stereo the ENTIRE time.  It was never returned to stock.  I did ask the cashier while my wife held the stereo, if you’re store would sell just the speakers, I wanted them either way though.  I was told no.  Another shopper then asked the cashier if I was buying the stereo.  The cashier  told them no without asking me and other customer paid for them while i was still in possession of them.  The cashier admitted she was wrong, ask her!.  The mistake was hers and instead of making it right she just let the other customer get them.  I understand a mistake was made, but that should have been between the store and the customer who never had possession instead of making me walk away.   Feel free to leave your name or number and I will speak to you in person.   You store though was 100% at fault.  I refuse to waiver on that point.  I believe you can also contact me through Yelp privately.  Same review there too<//Text>

{'time': 1618436699552, 'text': "I looked into your experience at our Milpas store as the way you described it was of concern to me. What I have learned is that you wanted to buy the speakers separately from a stereo set. That wasn't an option. Since you only wanted the speakers, you chose not to purchase the full stereo set at that time, returning it to our inventory while you looked at other items in the store. During that time, it was available for purchase by other customers, which is what happened. It would be great if we had multiple of the same items like traditional retailers. However, the one-of-a-kind treasures are what makes our stores unique and fun. A decision not to purchase something valuable and rare when given the chance may lead to someone else swooping in to get it. I wish you didn't have the regret of not buying the stereo set when you had your opportunity. However, even though the sense of being robbed is real for you, it was not the fault of the store staff."}</response>

I had a bad experience at this store recently.  It started as a mistake made by the cashier.   It could have been easily fixed but uncomfortable since it involved another customer.   Rather than doing the right thing the cashier told me she wouldn’t fix her mistake, even though she admitted she made one..  I have been in management and hospitality most of my life.  I currently have my own small business.  This is NOT how you handle mistakes.  I asked to speak to a manager.  The manager had the same attitude.  He told me what is done is done and had no interest making things right.   If one of my employees avoided responsibility like this, they would have been fired.  This was completely unprofessional.  I was so upset by this whole ordeal and wrong doing I left the store and called the corporate number.  I spoke to a receptionist.  She refused to take my name and number.  She told me they don’t handle thrift store issues.   She offered to give me the phone number of the thrift store I just left.  That made no sense.  I then emailed the Executive Director of the company.  No response from him either.   I’m left with the feeling the management and employees can do whatever they please with no accountability.  They will gladly take you donations and money but treat you with zero respect.  Without customers they wouldn’t  have a job.  Stop treating your  thrift store customers  like they are less than the people your organization is trying to help. Everyone deserves respect and non professional behavior should not be tolerated. Thank you.

P.S - if anyone responds trying to say this did not happen, this is further proof that they avoid accountability<//Text>

However, the items are all donated so they should be more reasonably priced.  There is new management, a breath of fresh air but there are still policies that actually prevent purchase.  You can do just as well to shop at Ross.

There are lots of great items here. Just expect to pay more than what you expect for a "thrift" store. They're on the higher side, but you can find some deals every once in a while.<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1528297176639, 'text': 'Lori, it is evident by your comments that we still have work to do in helping the community understand that Alpha Thrift Stores are not their own entity, but a funding source owned and operated by Alpha Resource Center (alphasb.org). We empower individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The thrift stores, which we have operated for some 30+ years, provide a significant source of funding for our programs as public funding does not cover our program expenses. When you shop at Alpha Thrift Stores you are supporting Alpha Resource Center and the individuals we serve.'}<//Response>< name>

I have read through a few of your recent reviews.   And I completely disagree with the opinions.
My experience is that they are WAY over priced.  They have much of their merchandise priced at retail priceing.
How can these so called thrift stores claim non profit status?  The taxes etc.. are much different for retail entities than for non profits..
Who are the people at the top?  How much do they make from Alpha Thrift?
These might be good things to think about when you are supporting your local non profit.<//Text>

I do not recommend that you Waste your money at this unfriendly overpriced junk shop.
I tried to donate and the helper told me to not give them anything and to take my donated bed frame and they were NOT friendly about it.
I do Not recommend anyone to visit .</Review>

Terrible customer service. I asked for a price check. They took to long to get a price. When they finally got the price. The cashier was so rude. She said they did a mistake on the price after waiting for 30 minuets.< /Review>

<text>I was given a suv that had expired registration plates from December  2020...  also the  registration in the glove box was from 2020. Six months? I drove around an entire day, I could have been pulled  over and stranded on the road if it had gotten towed. I returned  the vehicle the next morning and the guy at the counter different than the first guy gave me a different vehicle with no hassle.. but I must say the the first vehicle  with the bad plates had  a really bad smell inside, it smelled like Marijuana or something.. that smell made me sick. I was not happy with the first guy who checked  me in... he was not friendly at all, very rude when I would ask him a question, when I first  called to make a registration  he was misleading about the price. I asked him out the door what would  be the price he said 59.00  when I got to the store he said it would be 75.00... the first guy gave me a bad experience with expired plates and a car that smelled bad... his costumer service sucks..  now the second guy had great costumer  service and was very helpful.<//text>< Pictures>

I rented a car from Budget for three days. When I received my CC statement, I realized Avis charged me twice $543 on the same day. Budget also charged me for the correct amount  $182 on the same day as Avis.
When I tried to resolve with Avis this issue, I was not able to. I provided the copy of the CC statement where they could see double charge, they said we don't see any charges, just dispute those charges with your CC company.
This is horrible experience I ever had with the rental company.</text>< Time>

Lol don't trust the price they tell you they'll charge.  I got a receipt for $355 when I rented a car and then I extended and was told I'd be charged $65 more for two more days...all gravy.  Welp I come to check my account for my paycheck to hit and sure enough there's a charge for $642 dollars from them!!!  I messaged them and they said every charge is correct and I dropped off "late" so I had an extra fee.  The man on the phone asked what time id like to drop it off when I extended and I said 11 am and he said fine.  The lady who was dealing with my problem said since I picked up at first at 9 am it needed to be dropped off by then too....why TF ask me when I want to drop off if you're going to charge me for being late?!?!  Horrible service, don't trust the price they quote you or take it and deal with a couple hundred dollars more charged.  Jasmine was the one dealing with my issue and was not helpful at all....literally basically just shrugged off the fact that I was falsely told one charge would be processed when it was grossly incorrect.  Save yourself from this place, they're sketchy.<//text>

I showed up at 5:58 for a prepaid 6p rental. Not the best move, but I tried calling 3 times on my way there to let them know I was stuck in traffic. No one answered. When I arrive the lights were off, door shut. Thankfully I was able to find the employee heading out. Just annoying to find people cutting corners to end their day 5 minutes early. Embarrassing for the company.</Review>

These guys a Great! Quick friendly. The only place I go. Cars are clean. They work with you on time. There is a gas station right next door. Cars are new. Low miles. I had 1 on the many cars I have rented with a low tire pressure. They upgraded me with no questions asked. I won't go anywhere else</Review>

Quick & easy rental.  I needed a rental while my car was in the shop, and this location was a short walk from the dealership.  I got a reasonably good rate, and everything went smoothly.< /text>

THIEVES! They ripped me off by adding on 82 miles to my bill the next day after I signed for 60 miles which was accurate. They charged my credit card without authorization. I filled a complaint, missed a deadline and now I’m forced to pay or file a suit.<//review>

What a great experience at Calderon Tire this morning.  Not only did they fix my tire, which unexpectedly picked up a nail, but they did it in record time and were very reasonable on cost.   I've dealt with a fair amount of tire dealers, but this was by far the best experience.   The manager, who I didn't catch her name, was extremely friendly and helpful.  A+++  Would recommend them highly!!!   And how great that it's a neighborhood store serving the Sunnyvale neighborhood as well as they do.  Thanks Calderon Tire!<//Text>

<review>This tire shop is absolutely wonderful!! I have an old vehicle that is barely worth the price of a new set of tires from any other tire shop.  The car works great for schlepping loads but the tires were worn and unsafe.
The staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable and super friendly!
Not to mention I got a great deal on an awesome used set of tires!
They made my life safe in this vehicle!!
Thanks Calderon ❤️</review><gmapID>0x808fcb7a82274b73:0xe9f7c976b6a40684< /gmapID>< Date>

This place was amazing! Friendly and efficient. I came in for new tires and they were the cheapest in the city and I don’t think it was even 30 minutes and I was out door! Great service!</Review>

Looking for a deal? Would highly recommend coming to this place. They have excellent deals for their tires, fast service also didn't spend hours on end waiting for my tires to be replaced! I was in and out

New or used tires are the way to go! Save $$ in the long run<//text>

I've been here a few times, once to buy tires and once to get tires mounted and balanced. Anytime I need anything tire related done I won't go anywhere but here. Everyone is so nice and so helpful, and they work with you to find exactly what you need for the right price. Fantastic service and great work. 10/10 would recommend.< /text>

They we're very helpful and did a great job. After they put my tires one of the guys cleaned my tires and buffed my headlights for no additional charge i thought that was a very kind gesture from them so i appreciate the work! I'll definitely be coming back here for tires.<//text>< resp>

Very helpful. Did a thorough assessment of my tire and tried to salvage it. Luckily, they notified there was irreparable damage in the inside. They were able to get me a "lightly used" tire, aka basically brand new, and install it. All that assessment and tire change took less than an hour and only cost $50 total.<//review>

A great place for healthy food options -- PROMISE!
By far has the best Thai Tea with Bubbles. As a matter of fact I put them in all of my ordered drinks.
The Poki bowls is a must to try. Ingredients are simple enough but its the way they prepare it that makes it good.
Tbaar has several locations in my area which ensures me to visit this store at least 3 times a week.</text>

Excellent,  the place looks neat and organize. I found a very good menu, overall taro drink that I ❤, prices are competitive and the service also vg.
Hopefully one day we have taro without sugar.</Review>

This is a boba place I have gone to quite a few times, and it has strongly made me want to write a review for this place because honestly, I have been disappointed by the quality of drinks for awhile now. When it first opened, their drinks were ok, but the more I came, the worst it got. Here's why- one time I ordered their Tiger Sugar Bubble Milk Tea and yes, while it was a new item, I had high expectations for it. It's new, so they should have at LEAST tested it out right? Wrong. The drink tasted bitter, and the iconic sugar syrup tasted like burnt rubber/sugar and felt like I was sipping on glue... All I know is... it did NOT taste good, and I would not order it again. I have ordered other versions of the Tiger Sugar Milk Tea at other boba places, and it has never tasted anything like THIS.... Then, yesterday, after a few months of not visiting Tbaar, I decided to head back because I was having a boba craving and was in the area at the time. I decided to order a Green Tea with Milk Foam and 75% sugar. The milk foam had a good balance of salt and cream, but boy, the Green Tea drink itself was NOT good. First off, there was no ice whatsoever in my drink, and I double checked my receipt to see if the male cashier wrote down no ice, and there wasn't any implication. Yet, my drink was lukewarm, and it tasted like I was drinking water- the tea was extremely diluted. Some of the boba balls were also somewhat hard to chew.  I don't know whether it was because I had a bad person making my drinks (I think it was always a specific male with glasses who made my drinks?), but every visit's been quite disappointing lately. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the ambience and interior design of the boba shop is actually really nice; it would be a good place to hang out to study or talk with friends. But for the drinks? Probably wouldn't be my first choice.<//Text>

When I arrived at the front of the store I couldn’t tell it was open because the windows were pretty tinted. Once I walked in I was greeted by friendly employees & also pretty surprised😮 about how nice and comfortable the decor was. The ambiance was pretty chill❄️.  I ordered a Taro smoothie w/ boba & my drink was ready about 2 minutes. My drink was really good & the boba in it was tasty. I would definitely come again.</text>

< Review>
This place holds plenty of great memories for me with my brother before he went off to college out of the US. I still go here regularly, I can't get through a week without at least one matcha milk foam green tea drink with tapioca. I love the drinks here, and I can't go to any other boba spot. This place's atmosphere, memories, and drinks are just too good. They offer a large variety of beverages to try, and have some delicious spamasubis. The staff is very friendly, and do their best to deliver delectable drinks to their customers.</Review>

Good drinks. I drink very interesting white pearl. There is good habit to drink. When you or i order 1 any kind of drinks which tbaar serve. I will drink too fast. Ha. I think there is good expensive production of fruits being mixed with ice or ice cream which i am not sure what tbaar add. Still awesome drink taste! Easy finishing drink when ndrinking.</Text>

Well I thought it would be much better! My French toast was fine, though one was very soggy and not cool through. My daughter got the waffles and asked for strawberries on top, she was disappointed to find out they weren’t fresh strawberries, just thawed strawberries! Nothing wrong with that if you like that soggy waffles! Service was friendly and quick though!< /Review>

<Text>I am very happy that the Waffle Spot is open and taking precautions for guests' safety. There is plenty of parking on the east side and currently you enter through the Amigo Spot patio.  As of Feb 4 there is only outdoor dining on their patio that has been substantially extended into the parking lot. It's covered to protect from the elements, but some sunshine still found its way to our table 😊

Waffles are always perfect.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80deaad363d4056b:0x565c36c3649108c2< /Gmap_id>< userid>

The food quality was okay except that my waffle was barely warm. The service was marginal, and I was surprised that no half-and-half was available for my coffee, so I was offered non-dairy creamer (!) or heavy cream. The seating area was not in its old location, but rather within the adjoining Mexican restaurant, which was a tad creepy. The bacon and the sausages were quite good. My overall impression of this restaurant is that it has poor management, but the workers are doing their best to keep the ship afloat.</review>

This restaurant was walking distance from our hotel, and was a nice place for some pretty filling breakfast food. Staff were friendly and on top of things.. My only complaint was the rice that came with my chorizo and eggs was cold.<//Review>

The Waffle Spot is one of those restaurants that I think not many people know about. It definitely has a lot of variety and is a great pick if you’re a waffle and French Toast lover. I was relieved to find that there was outdoor seating available. During this covid era, some restaurants don’t have the space for it. My friend and I ordered the Sir Waffelot’s French Toast. It was topped with strawberries, an orange maple syrup as well as a cream cheese whipped cream. I added bacon, sausage, and eggs to the order too. Everything was delicious! I will definitely come back to try something different. If you want to satisfy that breakfast craving, try it out. Eat up!!!<//text>

Awesome experience.  Service was prompt and very friendly, prices were fair (13.50 for a breakfast platter) and the food was delicious.  Blueberry waffle was excellent.</review>

<Text>They were very nice and the food was pretty good but honestly not much better than Denny's.... I'm super partial to over-medium eggs and mine were cooked all the way through. For the price, I think they should know how to cook eggs. I would hate to have seen what would come out a medium rare steak here😂.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I was staying a few hotels down from here at the DoubleTree and the coffee sucks so I decided to look up places that I could walk to to get a cup of coffee the nearest Starbucks is about a mile and a half away over the mountain, and it came to the waffle place. The coffee was superb and the fruit bowls that I picked up for my kids gone the second I put them down. I recommend this place for your breakfast and lunch needs. They close at 2pm.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>4</Rate>< user_id>

<user>101348537418860665322</user><text>We went for breakfast on Saturday 02/20/2021 at around 8:45 or so. We went there because my husband loves waffles. Didn't wait very long to be seated. Our food was good the waffles were definitely fire, came out perfect just the way he like it. I am giving this place five stars because of the service. I don't remember our servers name and I wish I knew it because she was awesome. Very friendly, polite, HONEST, and just great great great customer service, always checking if we need anything, filling our drinks, I had mentioned that our hot chocolate tasted like water not only did she take it off the bill but she also came back with new ones that were out of this world good if you like hot chocolate. I say "honest"because we asked about a few items on the menu and she was brutally honest and we loved that she apologized for being so straight and super honest but we thanked her for being that way. Honest is the only way to be. But, going to the Waffle Spot was the BEST WAY TO START OUR AMAZING DAY! I really want to say Thank you for the AWESOME SERVICE!!!<//text>< Rating>

Classic breakfast place. During COVID they are only serving out of one restaurant. Do you don’t get the same ambiance but the food is just as good. The Waffle Spot draws a lot of locals as well as tourists. When you arrive check in and put your name down. Due to the small dining room and social distancing the wait might be longer. You can scan the menu outside so once inside your ready to order.

The menu features eggs, waffles, and other classic breakfast favorites. You won’t get anything unique or special here. The food is fresh and well prepared.

If your staying in the hotel I’d recommend calling and ordering take out.  It will be less social interactions and will save you time.  You could also eat in the pool area.

Ample parking out front. Staff is friendly. They have a few hand sanitizer stations inside.< /Review>

Our server Zaina (sorry if i butchered her name!) Was wonderful. We came early and it was very busy, the kitchen was a tad behind but she kept checking on us, keeping in contact and asking if we're okay. She was a wonderful person aswell as everyone else who we spoke to. This is only our second time here but we love it and will definitely be back because of her!< /Text>

<text>This used to be our go to place when visiting SD, but it's gone downhill. Food was great, however, service was terrible. Many of the younger staff had major attitude and there was a lot of eye rolling going on, along with the usage of curse words while hanging out in the kitchen. I have nothing again cussing but it's a major no when you're on the clock and working with customers who have young children. It's just not professional.  Will not be returning next time we ate in town.

Update info: my husband and I went in on Wednesday June 2nd around a little after 8am. We were the 2nd party in the restaurant and sat in the 2nd to the last booth farthest from the outside entrance (closest to the kitchen). Young lady who took our drink order was great but everyone else needs work on customer service.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I discovered this place while visiting friends in San Diego and requesting we go somewhere for waffles one morning wich led to us discovering this spot. Now whenever I'm in town visiting I eat here practically every morning.

Classic diner feel with a friendly staff, and delicious freshly made food at an excellent price. The waffles are the perfect classic Belgian Waffle and I haven't had a flavor I've disliked yet!

Needless to say, I can't wait for my next visit.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The Waffle Spot is one of those restaurants that I think not many people know about. It definitely has a lot of variety and is a great pick if you’re a waffle and French Toast lover. I was relieved to find that there was outdoor seating available. During this covid era, some restaurants don’t have the space for it. My friend and I ordered the Sir Waffelot’s French Toast. It was topped with strawberries, an orange maple syrup as well as a cream cheese whipped cream. I added bacon, sausage, and eggs to the order too. Everything was delicious! I will definitely come back to try something different. If you want to satisfy that breakfast craving, try it out. Eat up!!!< /review>

This place had amazing waffles!  The pancakes were good too and huge.  The waitstaff is a little slow to come by, but they didn't forget about you.  I had the baja omelet with avocado, cheese and salsa and it came with mini waffles and potatoes- yummy.  The coffee is okay, but they aren't known for the brew.  Remember it is called The Waffle Spot and they have a mascot which is fun for the kids.< /review>

The place was crowded we had to wait 50 minutes to get in no seating outside for the wait. I ordered scrambled eggs they were undercooked and raw and runny the copy was the worst coffee I've ever had I couldn't put enough sugar or creamer in it to make it drinkable the hash browns are so thin there was hardly any potato there just a layer of crested potato I would not go back there</review>

Food was good BUT the Service is HORRIBLE! No smiles or pleasent introduction.....very dry personalities. One thing they seem to love is repeating "that will be an extra charge...is that ok?" Sylvia and the other girls who disappear not coming back 15-20 mins. You get 1 cup of coffee for 25 mins and you have to walk up to them for them to acknowledge you. Unless you a regular or they know you.....good luck.<//Text>

My favorite country potatoes and waffles are the ones at the Waffle Spot! We've stayed at King's In a few times now and had breakfast every morning (and lunch one time) at the Waffle Spot during our stay. It's not a continental breakfast included with the hotel stay, but as a result you get way better quality food.

Our favorite things on the menu by far are:
- the waffles (we've had regular, blueberry, and banana nut), which are more flavorful and dense than I'm used to waffles being (not quite as dense as a cake donut, but these are to normal waffles as cake donuts are to normal donuts), and
- the country potatoes, which are cooked and seasoned to perfection (veggies cooked crispy in places but still with some fresh veggie crunch, and just the right amount of seasoning to make every bite flavorful).

Tip: Arrive early in the day to avoid a wait (or else assume you'll need to wait for a table or get your food to-go to take back to your room). We were used to being seated right away at the beginning of our trip when we were still waking up early enough to arrive when it opened at 7am, and then surprised to see a wait toward the end of our trip when we'd adjusted to California time and were waking up later.

I'd give this review five stars for the waffles and potatoes alone, but I did remove one star because quality of some dishes can be hit or miss (every now and then the potatoes/veggies are overcooked, and the omelettes come out amazing half of the time and at other times seem more like they mixed the veggies with the eggs to make a frittata to save time instead of folding in the veggies to make an omelette. I haven't kept track, but I'd guess the times when the quality wasn't as great might have coincided with when they were really busy, so that might be one more reason to go early in the day! Even with that caveat, I'd go back in a heartbeat; I already miss the waffles and country potatoes now that our trip is over! :)< /Text>

<Text>Amazing place to go for breakfast.
Huge breakfast menu here and everything cooked fresh to order.
Very family friendly, in fact friendly place all round.
We stayed at kings in for 5 days and had breakfast here four times, trying different things each time.
Yep, the waffles are awesome but there is a nice Mexican breakfast menu too.
The Mexican omelette is good and the country breakfast is also a winner.
Good drinks.
Can get busy here but there wait is never very long but worth it.
If you're looking for a decent breakfast in San Diego then jump in a cab and go here because it will be worth it!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxPJXEEEhcfE99WezJ-Pz3KUQjWGQNQhpPWDxf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxhXyYoMWDH8v6m9zkiK319hF96F5Km7Zi0qGg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhs7yhgifKCzA40rPRLQI2Kz8-FlKrVJ_0aQzp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlWYSQ5lkhmGJIE-v40HOiBWUDfjV6XOp0s_dg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNryyIZ8VyblkyGffLyi0ch-wO_d_eiK5YZDw6P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBdGcMSfMNzLSOa9WfkaB96Np_Pp58XLAkXshJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMey8Th0Sivo6IK8bvRb_tbQT_mZ989LXLTs04F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9m8Y7-HEw3oYEik93-0f6w63iFxfQV0rn34xE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV1W5r3ubhTARQiO46arcJlqd0D97EU2u9yPxd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3hj0g5dQfUsfz58qp6x70bz6kAikapHzDSzlW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0or0XAI2q6G8rSS6hWpgg68_qC6ikBsPbangl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOROZKKAQbiUTPgtv_iaSMnwdUsM1p8hpLexmLI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<date>1563128099436<//date><Text>After a 10 minute waiting line I got a chance to finally get inn and try out the food.  I was seated at the counter and was quickly offers something to drink.  The menu had several iluatrations of the waffle spot royal family, cute but not really helpful.  I ordered an apple and cinnamon waffle with a side of bacon and unsweetened iced tea.

Food was way better than what I expected it to be, one single waffle was more than enough and the extra bacon turned out to be to much ( I left a single strip our of the 5 handled to me).   I can still taste the cinnamon and the sliced apple with the melted butter, delicious. I was left to wander why they only offered one syrup, a wider variety would go well with their different waffle options.

The staff was great, quick, clean and ready to serve me if I needed something extra without being too pushy, an amazing and difficult quality to achieve.

Overall a great expirience.</Text>< username>

<review>Not a bad breakfast diner. The wait was longer than it should have been for a Monday morning and it took a while to get service once we were sat. The waffles were fantastic, but my waffle burger was way over cooked. They do waffles great, but I’d pass on the grill. All in all not a bad breakfast, and the kiddos have a good time, as evidenced by my daughters pic!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIQw0HY0WRzPHbFP0a9_o8zB_-uGLEhPfil7D-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>It's actually my lunch break at a different place today, The Waffle Spot.  Yelp reviews were on point!

Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon on mini-#WAFFLES, Country potatoes with Peach Iced Tea.  Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious!

The best part was my entertaining server, Paula!  She is one of the BEST customer service oriented people that I have had the opportunity to encounter. #AMAZING<//text>< pictures>

I wish my veggie skillet had mire red peppers than carrots and onions, but the veggies were cooked well. I appreciated the friendly hostess and busser, but our server pretty much brought the bill while we were still eating and had my husband pay on her little machine, again, while we were still eating! Did not like that. Anyhow, they were adhering to Covid protocols pretty good, even gave you option to scan your menu through QR code, if you have an iPhone. Might give them another chance because the waffles were good.< /Text>< user>

This place is a hidden gem. Delicious breakfast options that are not just waffles. Best Bacon EVER! Cute retro diner in a vintage motel. It gets busy but you wait in the hotel lobby instead of outside on a sidewalk in the hot sun like most breakfast places in San Diego.</text>

<Time>1551238645621<//Time><rate>4< /rate><text>I got the breakfast Burrito and the mini waffles they were both delish! Lots of parking in the Knights Inn. I gave it 4 starts aside from the fact the 1st waitress gave me coffee and a dirty glass of milk when I asked for coffee with milk. She didn’t apologize or get my order right.
-2nd waitress had just gotten back from NYC and she was very sweet. Thankfully she is the one that waited on us the rest of the time we were there.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF_El00tNc1POWBh0I4pUqEFncd9LTsPTsdGfm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzL04UmNoIcr6AWhvAEaWrlsionATiSPXqYZQG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

This place is awesome! Great food at reasonable prices. Friendly staff and lots of fun for kids. Go on the weekend to be greeted by the Waffle King himself. Love how they get festive during the holidays. I hope they never stop decorating and dressing up for Halloween!< /Text>

Great service, very friendly staff. Only have been there once but got the waffle plate and was very happy with it. Everything seemed fresh and cooked to order. I visited alone so I got seated immediately but it didn't seem like a huge wait. I visited around 11 on a Tuesday but it was still pretty busy.</Text>

I used to work across the street from here and my phone thinks I work here and I never corrected it - destination is always waffles.Love the berries & cream waffle plus hash browns, extra crispy. Their lemonades are really tasty and they're unfailingly nice here. Go on off hours if you can!</review>

Okay...

It’s Covid so the atmosphere has changed pretty much anywhere you.

We sat in an area that doesn’t look like the bubbly retro diner shown in their pictures.

It’s located in an older hotel, the dining room had that old hotel musty smell.

The food was meh. Potatoes and hash browns were drowned in oil and the oil didn’t taste the freshest like someone hasn’t cleaned the stove in a while.
Waffles were okay.

Big Portions but the taste, quality and preparation could use some improving.<//Text>

<Review>Get. The. Waffles.
Literally stumbled into this popular spot on accident - best thing that could've happened - so glad it did. Super cute and so tactfully well-maintained, very decent service which is always nice, but the food guys - the food. First of all they have hash browns - yay. Everything was well-seasoned and well-portioned and for a perfectly reasonable price. Huge bonus  - they're smart enough to offer the option of mini waffles with any of the meals and that mini waffle made me say f* a moderately-healthy, delicious omelette, next time I'm getting a plate full of those waffles.
Best waffles I've ever had.
Be smarter and go early or if you can't or didn't, just be prepared for a bit of a wait for a little great spot and a chance to have those waffles.< /Review>< user>

<review>All of our utensils were dirty. The cup I had with water was dirty. I have a dairy and pork allergy. I was given food with pork even though I specifically ordered a beef dish. I chose to dine here because of the great reviews but this place is not up to par with the reviews. Maybe the locals don't have allergies and don't mind a dirty setting. It's a hard NO for me. On my way home now to take my allergy medication as I am leaving feeling nauseous and dizzy.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

This place is so much fun . 😊

There is a life size waffle that greets you at the door. 🥞
The waffle is so fun and cool . I come in to eat his family members and that's ok by him . 😋

Parking is good by the amigo spot. 🚗

The decor is great very post modern but updated and well kept . 🛏

Menu is retro dinner . 📖🍽🍴

Wait staff is cool and very accommodating.  😊

Very welcoming to families and lots of fun . 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👦‍👦

Prices and portion sizes are good. Good value. 🥓🥞

Great brigth colors and larger than life.  〽️✳

This place is not just cute it also serves DELICIOUS FOOD! I personally love this place and have had many breakfasts with my mom here but my friend I took today is a picky eater. He ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered the blueberry waffle platter. We both ordered coffee. The coffee is amazing. It almost has a chocolate undertone to it that maked me fall in 💘. My friend also loved the coffee and didn't care that there was no flavor creamer. His chicken and waffles gave me order envy. Next time I'm ordering that. He said this was the best chicken he has had. It tastes like meat. He also said that it was fried like REAL SOUTHERN fried chicken. It just fell right off the bone. He was happy that they has Louisiana Hot Sauce there. He ordered a pecan waffle and they did NOT skimp on pecans. He had some left even after the waffle was long gone. We both thought the waffles were out of thia world! I had an abundance of blueberries...real blueberries not the frozen or syrupy ones but fresh tasting berries. Mmmm. The waffle held up to all the syrup I drenched it with. I asked for crowns and they gave us two that I managed to talk my friend into wearing with me. They also have a color Sir Waffle Lots face on a placemat. Adults have to ask for one but kids automatically get one. They have some very talented guests that have left their mats that are hung on the wall. Make sure to take photos on the way in or out with Sir Waffle Lot. Our server was fantatsic..always checking on us and the other tables around us and she kept pur coffee cups full. I'm looking forward to going back.<//text>

We ordered our food via telephone.   When we arrived the staff appeared unorganized.  My wife had to go around people who were waiting to see if there was seating available, to check if our order was ready.  They informed her they would check on the order,  all the while our food was ready just sitting on a table.  Once we arrived to our hotel to eat, we found food and condiments we missing from our order.  The food tasted average.  I wouldn't return to this restaurant.</Text>

This food was simple amazing! The omelet was stuffed and cheesy. The chorizo had great taste. The mini waffles were soft inside and crunchy outside and the batter was delicious. The french toast was out of this world!! It was a churro waffle dipped in french toast batter and fried. Didnt know that blend existed...but I'm so glad I was introduced. The service was quick and friendly, overall a great experience. Definitely going again when in town!</text>

Only negative about the waffle spot was the Sunday morning wait. Also sides can be a little pricey if you wanted something that's not included in the meal you choose.< /review>

<review>I love the Waffle King. They take the sensibilities of vintage looking but still nice diner and give you good (if very unhealthy) food in a fun atmosphere. Honestly, the food had its issues (not enough avocado, no healthy options that didnt sound terrible) but it is just such a fun time there and it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. If you're staying at the King's Inn this is a no brainer, and if you're not it is still a wonderful little weekend spot because the king comes out in costume on weekends.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_Up4Up6khTC5huq_zj0J0POaX00MQXTBGh1wG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkk_PVD-cgekTaGt9_XRXM2ALvLV9zYVUsJCxF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>Okay...

It’s Covid so the atmosphere has changed pretty much anywhere you.

We sat in an area that doesn’t look like the bubbly retro diner shown in their pictures.

It’s located in an older hotel, the dining room had that old hotel musty smell.

The food was meh. Potatoes and hash browns were drowned in oil and the oil didn’t taste the freshest like someone hasn’t cleaned the stove in a while.
Waffles were okay.

Big Portions but the taste, quality and preparation could use some improving.</Review>< Rating>

<response>None</response><review>What a fantastic little spot for breakfast and lunch! We loved the diner vibe, 50s and 60s music, great food, and super friendly staff. Our server, Paula, was especially sweet and attentive. I had the Pumpkin Spice Waffle Platter and hubs had the regular Waffle Platter. "Platter" just means you get 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, and 2 sausage links with your waffle. It was so much food, I had a hard time finishing it! That said, I really wanted to because it was sooooo goooood!! There's even a person dressed as the Waffle King who walks around waving at customers and throwing finger guns. I wish we'd taken a picture with him/her/them!< /review><rate>5<//rate><name>Amber M.

<Review>I will never find another place like the waffle spot. I was on temporary order to this area and had my wife with me. We ate there twice a week for the month we were here. The waffles are spectacular, the gravy they make is even better. It’s this lovely thin gravy that tastes more like cheese than gravy. I recommend so hard.</Review></record>

<text>I love the Waffle King. They take the sensibilities of vintage looking but still nice diner and give you good (if very unhealthy) food in a fun atmosphere. Honestly, the food had its issues (not enough avocado, no healthy options that didnt sound terrible) but it is just such a fun time there and it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. If you're staying at the King's Inn this is a no brainer, and if you're not it is still a wonderful little weekend spot because the king comes out in costume on weekends.< /text>< user_name>

<Review>I have to admit that I didn't want to try this place for our last breakfast while on a short birthday weekend after seeing the pictures online. I would have preferred to go to Snooze because of the more adult looking decor, but I was out voted. Our Lyft ride from downtown was about 10 minutes but it was a nice scenic ride over to that area of town. The restaurant is actually connected to an outside motel. The decor was not as childish as I thought and the place was  very clean. We were seated quickly.  As we were deciding from the many options,  I was  checking out the size of the plates coming out...Huge!! Our server gave us all of the pros and cons of what we were considering.  The service was great..never had to ask for a refill. The food came fairly quick..maybe 10 minutes. We liked the presentation and taste of our food. Would definitely recommend and maybe return if ever in SD again. Prices were also very good.< /Review>< UserId.>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I was so sad when my waitress dropped off my plate. She didn't say much and I think she could read the very dissappointed look on my face when I saw my waffle come out with 3 small slices of banana and 6 walnuts on top of it. My excitement for breakfast went out the window. I work at a grocery store so I am well aware that an entire banana would have cost less than .25 cents to put on top of my waffle. This was the special of the day, except in order to substitute potatoes(very inexpensive) in place of a meat item it cost me an extra $2 which doesn't make ANY sense! I asked for almond milk assuming they wouldn't have a dairy-free cream option for coffee, only to get offered skim milk. No! These are not even close to the same. Ask anyone with an allergy or food intolerance!

If you have any health concerns, then you may want to eat somewhere else. There is no telling what they are doing in the back or how much they will overcharge you for what they may serve you. You can see the pools of Country Crock oil on top of the eggs...< /review>< user_name>

VERY GOOD. If you are a Waffle Fan you HAVE to try. Interior decorator needs royalty payments. The Churro Waffle tastes like a Churro as per my wife. The Apple Cinnamon is a nice sweet but "healthy flavor". The chicken is good but start with the breast, because the rest will fill you up fast. Overall 4 star because the location is kind of odd, however convenient for hotel residents.

Don't forget to use the Yelp check-in promo like I did.< /review>

The food was good. But the service was so so, we waited quite awhile until someone finally came just to take out drink order, even though there was only 3 families including us in the restaurant. But the food is worth the pricing and alot of options.<//Review>

Unorganized. Ended up waiting for 15 minutes in line to put our names down to be seated. People walked right past us and asked to be seated. No one helped us so we ended up leaving.</Review>

My favorite parts of the experience are the super creative art work drawn in crayon by patrons and displayed on the walls and waffle man opening the door for us when we first walked in. It was a happy surprise that made us all laugh. The service is polite and friendly. I found the food to be quite average, hence the rating.< /Review>

Indeed the spot for waffles. The plain waffles are great but I'd happily come back to try their various kinds. My companion was very happy with the chicken and waffles.< /text>

<text>I thought the food was delicious and our waitress was really nice! I ended up having just the normal waffle, eggs, sausage and bacon, and it was bomb! Plus, the other thing that's nice is that everything is very reasonably priced! If you want a delicious breakfast or brunch at an amazing price, take the time to check this place out. You wont be disappointed.</text><Rate>5</Rate><time>1566916415015</time>< Response>

Went here with my daughter because of the reviews. We sat down and sat there for 10 minutes before anyone came over. It seemed like one person was waiting on every table in the restaurant. She was pleasant and took our order. Our waffles came out ice cold. My daughter touched her waffle and said momma it’s cold. COLD! I didn’t want to send them
because we had already been there for over 45 minutes when our food came. We got the waffles with strawberries and they were canned strawberries in syrup. The food was mediocre at best. There was a person dressed as a waffle that was walking around that my daughter liked but really the only highlight. We both had stomach aches after eating there.  I would not recommend. There are a thousand breakfast places better in San Diego. Only eat here if you are trapped In the hotel and it is the only option.<//text>

<review>Food was not worth the price first off. Tacos where cold, meat was soggy there was to many things on the taco. Tomatoes, Onions, Guacamole and sauce made the taco hard to grip falling apart as you picked it up. My rice was dry had no flavor, Beans where also cold and my Enchilada was ok not to bad on the sauce and portions on the meat. Salad was not fresh dressing was thick and sour. All together was not worth it and I will not be returning again.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>Their waffle, fried egg and steak are tasty. Waitress very kind, her son married a Taiwanese girl, and will give you an introduction about Taiwan if you are willing to understand more.

<date>1567454290152< /date><rating>1<//rating><review>We were so excited to try this place for the online hype about the churro waffle but it all turned out to be a huge disappointment. Our experience was bad from the start. We got on the waiting list and they forgot about us. Once we were seated the coffee mug I was given had red lipstick on it. I mentioned it to the server and she asked me if it was my lipstick on the mug (I had no lipstick on) there was also a little bug in my husband’s water and the server told us it was just a coffee grain. Once she came back with the new coffee and water my husband asked for a straw and she looked at him like she was annoyed. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and the inside of one of the chicken was practically frozen. We noticed that the couple next to us was also talking about how rude the server was treating them. Never coming back to this place again. Do yourself a favor and skip this in favor of something more reputable.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Awesome place to eat breakfast and super unique! I ended up having the Mexican omelette which was stuffed with cheese and jalapenos and died a little bit from how good it was.

Highly recommend it and would go back again.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>This place was disgusting to me. First the waiter was very rude to us. However the lady in the front who seated us was nice. When I got my food I was eating and it was fair. When I ate my eggs the was 3 BIG pieces of egg shell on the bottom. They brought me a new one. Then when I ate my waffle on the side of it there was a HAIR. This was the worst restaurant I have been too. If I could rate this a 0 star I would but I can’t. It’s not the workers fault it’s the person who hired them fault!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The waffles are great.
I definitely recommend the chicken and waffles. The entire menu is good, but the waffles are a real treat. Wait staff is awesome and the prices more than reasonable. The debit is a slice of Americana.< /review>

What a fantastic little spot for breakfast and lunch! We loved the diner vibe, 50s and 60s music, great food, and super friendly staff. Our server, Paula, was especially sweet and attentive. I had the Pumpkin Spice Waffle Platter and hubs had the regular Waffle Platter. "Platter" just means you get 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, and 2 sausage links with your waffle. It was so much food, I had a hard time finishing it! That said, I really wanted to because it was sooooo goooood!! There's even a person dressed as the Waffle King who walks around waving at customers and throwing finger guns. I wish we'd taken a picture with him/her/them!< /review>

My friends from out of town stayed at the hotel attached to this place so we received a 10% discount. The waffles were very good and they do have a bar (yea mimosas!) but that's about all the good things I can say about this restaurant. The bacon was saturated in greasy and the scrambled eggs were neon...NEON!!! The kitsch was funny albeit random but only because of my friends enjoyment of it.< /review>

First and last tine there. Staff definitely not friendly.  Waitress put our food down and never came back. Maybe she knows their food sucks. Worst coffee we have ever had and the food was horrible.  Waffles like dough in the middle, Eggs and potatoes burnt.   Beware.< /review>

All the waffles i ate, fall short of taste when you enjoy the waffles here. In the Kings Inn, a cosy spot.friends ypu have a wide variety to chose from and gulp down. A gastronomic delight and the fillings are subtly delicious< /Text>

OK, so I was a little turned off mentally that the restaurant was attached to a old hotel, but BOY WAS I IMPRESSED! I asked a lady and her two kids if they food was good as I drove up in the parking lot. The kids beat her to the bunch telling me how good it was. Man... It was no lie! Food was A+! Service was A+! Value was A+!  So yeah this one is a keeper and I will be back!</review>

Found this place by Google. A cute diner within a hotel. Our waitress was enjoyable, always making sure our coffee cup was refilled. They have different types of waffles, the favorite is the churro waffle, which tastes just like it sounds. No need for syrup at this place.</Review>

We were staying at the Kings Inn and decided to eat here for breakfast... big mistake!! First, we sat down and ordered 10 minutes before both tables next to us, and yet, their food was served before us. Then, my $16.50 steak and eggs meal was a complete disaster. The steak was actually smaller than my fork. Ordered it med rare, it came out well done. So, the manager brought me out another one and I made sure to cut it open in front of her and it was raw! I understand you're giving tourist trap prices with these basic meals, but you can at least do it correctly. Then my 4yo daughters food was brought out 10 minutes after all of ours. By this time I had enough of this incompetence and told the manager not to even bother bringing another plate out. She did comp our entire meal, but we will never be back there.< /Text>

My review from yelp on 5/7/2017
Came in very hungry with 3 of my friends. After 5 minutes of waiting, we got to sit at the Amigo Spot. The seats were very comfortable than many restaurants I sat because of the padding.
Our server was very kind and attentive to my 2 friends who decided to drink coffee. She was also very patient when it came to getting down my friend's order as we were still indecisive on what to get. The menu layout is very simple, but I do not recall seeing any pictures of the food on the menu.
I ordered the egg waffle benedict and it was delicious. I loved the fact that the waffle was on the bottom of the egg with some ham. The hashbrown was good for me, but my friend said it was okay. My friends loved coming here for them waffles. I like the fruit they gave me after eating the benedict. A great breakfast I had indeed.
Price wise, I think it cost a bit more than some places where I have breakfast. I can not complain though as it was filling.
Wait, I was not full. My friends were though (I eat more than the typical average person), so I had some freebies from my friends who did not finish their food. They were a piece of bacon, some mini waffles,more hashbrown and a slice of steak. It was delicious.
Since the location is in a hotel/inn, the restroom there also has free mouthwash you can use after eating. I thought it was unique so definitely giving them a 5 stars for nice, talkative and courteous waiter, for their delicious food, comfy seats, and the mouthwash I used in the restroom and more on the 4 stars for the pricing as I was not full, but that is just me.< /review>

Great hidden gem in San Diego. Never seen advertisement for this place yet it’s always packed, on the positive side they open up the next door restaurant to seat everyone coming in for breakfast so wait times are low
Love their banana nut waffles and Mexican omelet
The bacon waffle is also delicious, the bacon is mixed in!!!!
One of the best waffle places in San Diego</text>

<text>I enjoyed the Waffle stop. I had a pumpkin spice waffle which was quite nice. The flavors we're mild not over done and too sweet like Starbucks pumpkin spice latte. Their basic waffle configuration is a Belgian waffle. You can get gluten free as a plain waffle. The eggs we all got we're cooked perfectly including a poach

ed egg hard. The sausage links we're tasty and the bacon had meat on it and was tasty. Service was friendly and caring. A waffle bfast with eggs and meat was $11.25.< /text>< Rate>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>*This restaurant is inside for the Kings Inn If you go on a Sunday make sure you get there early if you want chicken with your waffles... We got there about 1pm. Myself and a previous guest were denied fried chicken due to they ran out for the day... They substituted chicken tenders for me to go with my pecan waffle. It wasn't bad but I would've prefered the breast, leg, & thigh that came with it for the $12.95 price than pay that same price for a substitution of tenders. Their breakfast burritos were huge & filling. Everyone was very kind & nice even Ana from the front desk of the hotel.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80deaad363d4056b:0x565c36c3649108c2<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Terrible and rude service. Sat us at table then we were Ignored by waitress for 30 minutes. Didn't even offer water. Got up and left, they didn't even care.Never going back. "The Crust" a block away was fantastic, fast and very courteous service, delicious food, Large portions.<//review>

< Review>
Busy kid-friendly breakfast place.  Good service.  The eggs benedict waffle plate, while supposedly very popular, was drenched in way too much hollandaise rather than having just a tasteful dollop. The other popular item, a breakfast nacho dish, was good but not a typical comforting breakfast food.< /Review>

<user>110774584844936204698< /user><Rating>3< /Rating><Review>We have high expectations for this place because of the reviews it have but our expectations were not accomplished. We order the fried steak with grabby and egg with two mini waffles and hashbrowns.
Steak with grabby= 10/10 delicious

Hashbrowns= 5/10 cold, not crispy,
plain flavour almost none.

Eggs= 10/10 regular egg flavour with the asked term

WAFFLES = 4/10 flavor almost none and the flavor of flour was high, their are not sweet, I mean ones you put the syrup they taste ok, but they were supposed to be "the best waffles" but they are just ok , you can feel the difference of flavor and texture from a frozen one , but that's it, they have nothing special. I will return for the fried steak and the fried chicken , but waffles , no thanks.</Review>< Pictures>

The place was full when we arrived. There were 3 other famous before us, but we only waited a few minutes because we were offered the option of sitting in the dining hall of the other restaurant in the same building. The Waffle was good, and service was good as well. I'd visit again if I was in the area.<//review>< pics>

Delicious breakfast spot with very hearty serving sizes. Chicken and waffles came with three pieces of chicken. Tangy waffles were an interesting combination of sweet and spicy. Located inside the King's Inn. Unassuming from the outside. Definitely worth going inside.< /text>

All I can say is try the Churro Waffle, no need for syrup, it is sooo good! Loved the environment and the waitress was prompt and had a very nice attitude. Will definitely go back. Military discount as well, incase you were wondering.< /Review>

We were very surprised about this place! We have passed it so many times as we drove on the 8 highway. I had a bacon and cheese omelette with the 2 small waffles. My GF had the Chicken and waffles with a churro waffle.. holy cow it was amazing!! Super affordable as well. Oh be sure to check out the waffle drawings posted up above the counter some were amazing! We will definitely be back!!!<//text>

My favorite breakfast spot.  I love their waffles and the staff is very nice.  I also tried their nopales (cactus) plate. It was delicious.
The music is also reminiscent of a 50's diner. Truly enjoyable.< /Text>

Good food. A little pricey for the basic stuff. And they do not tell you that they will charge you extra for sauces. And all they could say was sorry. It's OK when you it's not your money right? :/ sorry but common courtesy is to let people know that you are going to charge them for every extra sauce that is ordered...and it wasn't just 50 cents...I would try their church waffles though if you go.<//review>

We were seated quickly and the food came out fast. Just don’t order the eggs waffle Benedict. If the hollandaise sauce was fresh as the menu described, it probably would have been better. However, it was either out of a jar or old. It was gross. The waffles were decent. Clean restaurant and bathroom.<//review>

We were seated, then abandoned. Another table was seated and got their food before our server took our order. That was after flagging down a busboy and telling him what had happened.

Were our granddaughters not so excited about waffles we'd have walked out. Very disappointed.

However, that's the first bad experience we've had, so we'll give them another try.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Want a real old fashioned tasting waffle? This is the spot. They use malt powder in their waffle mix which gives their waffles that extra good taste. 1960's diner type atmosphere where the staff are friendly and efficient.<//review>

<text>The Waffle Spot always provides delicious food and friendly service at a reasonable price. They're located on Hotel Circle South, which can be tricky to find but it's definitely worth it. The restaurant itself is always clean and inviting. Their menu offers a variety of breakfast and lunch items, including Mexican Desayunos and BLTs, among others. I'd recommend The Waffle Spot for anyone looking for a good meal at a good price.</text>< pictures>

The happiest place I've been in ages!!  Thank you, Paula, for being so wonderfully upbeat and full of energy, and Jay for being so polite and quick to grab my coffee, and another young man  (didn't get his name but has a great haircut and the kindest smile) for being so personable and hard-working!  Fabulous place with an amazing staff 💕
And my breakfast was perfect, by the way... I had the blueberry waffles with bacon and eggs.<//Review>

Parking was easy and convenient. Nice area for the wait due to being very busy. The service was wonderful. The waitress was friendly and very helpful with suggestions and they had many options. I had the churro waffles per the waitress suggestion. I Loved them!!!! my sister is a bit on the picky side and she enjoyed her brunch very much. The kids felt comfortable and ate all the  food on their plates. I would definitely would go again.<//review>

Great breakfast spot. Had Spanish waffles that worked much better than I expected. Had to wait about twenty minutes on a Thursday morning wich was surprising but not too terrible. Reasonable prices.<//Text>

<Review>Came in here for breakfast on 3/13 and it was phenomenal. I ordered the pecan waffles with sunny side eggs, bacon and sausage and a side of hash browns. My husband had the churro waffles platter and a side of biscuits and gravy. We ordered the half waffle crown with bananas for our son. Food was GREAT, service was awesome and it was a great experience. 10/10</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Who knew a tacky looking waffle guy with a crown would be this popular!?
Located at the Kings Hotel is where The Waffle Spot Is spotted.

We were seated and later asked by our waitress to be moved which i thought was a bit weird because the seats were the same just place a section further? Regardless of her odd request we moved on with our day and ordered our waffles!

I got the Benedict with hash brown and a side of fruit. I was happy with everything and finished it before I can check out all the creative drawing of the Waffle King. After my heavy meal i just wanted to take a nice nap</Review>

<review>The staff here are very friendly, and it's a quaint little place. If you go around peak meal times, the wait can get pretty long, but it's SO worth it. They make some amazingly awesome waffles. I've tried a handful of them, and I've loved all of them so far.<//review>< pics>

The service was very friendly and fast, the restaurant was clean and had a beautiful old-style charm. The waffles were good but the chicken and waffles had a weird taste, the skin and seasoning were fine, the skin was crispy but the actual meat tasted old.<//review>

<text>Located off the lobby of some random motel, this is a diner type restaurant that doesn't have too much seating. The menu has a variety of breakfast items, but less waffle items than you would imagine although it's called The Waffle Spot. I came early and sat at the counter, so there was no wait. Staff was good for the most part, but I think since I was at the entryway it was better than it would have been had I not been there.

I ordered the 2 egg breakfast, which I choose hash browns and 2 mini-waffles. The portion is not at all generous, I wouldn't call it stingy, but it's close to it. The hash browns were a 4x4 flat square, the eggs were good, and the waffles are really mini, however, they were pretty good, being soft, moist, and fluffy.

Overall, this is a standard breakfast place, it's not really special, there's nothing you can get here that you couldn't get at another breakfast establishment. The food is fine, but for me, it's not worth more than a 10 minute wait or an inconvenient drive.</text>< Pictures>

The wait was short, staff was courteous and friendly. Food came out very quickly! And it was absolutely delicious. My friend had the blueberry waffles and loved them. I had the waffle eggs benedict and was in heaven. Add a star for the waffle man being available for pics! Loved it and will be back!<//text>

<username>Jacqualine Chan< /username><review>The staff here are very friendly, and it's a quaint little place. If you go around peak meal times, the wait can get pretty long, but it's SO worth it. They make some amazingly awesome waffles. I've tried a handful of them, and I've loved all of them so far.<//review>< Rating>

I think this is my new breakfast spot whenever I come back to San Diego. The retro style of the restaurant was nice and clean, service staff was great, and everything we ordered was delicious. I would highly recommend the waffles Benedict if you like eggs Benedict.< /Review>

Delightful ending to a trip to San Diego when group I was traveling with wanted traditional American breakfast. What a great find!!! We stepped into the Waffle Spot and we stepped back in time to the days of motor hotels with in-house restaurants. You'll find true retro diner ambiance here in a freshly decorated, remodeled "motel" lobby. Their staff was friendly and welcoming and most customers seemed to be locals who know the quality of this local gem. We had the Baja omelette ... very good, but the mini waffles were AMAZING! Definitely hit the SPOT!!!  (Also, I asked to see a room in the hotel and was delighted to see a nicely appointed room w/ 2 queens, clean fresh white bedding, travel themed throw pillows, clean modern room, updated bathroom (though small) ... looks like a wonderful place to stay and at a great price and great food downstairs ... bfast, lunch, and dinner ... Waffle Spot on 1 side and Amigos on the other, a Mexican restaurant that I'm guessing boasts the same great food and service.</review>

The waffles are AMAZING... And the rest of our meal (omelette and hash browns) equally so!!  Our server, Paula, is the sweetest.

It is an old school breakfast diner, and the food has that yummy yesteryear homemade goodness taste. The place was packed, which was a good indicator of how good it is. Would I come again?... Well, we drove across town to come back the second day we were in San Diego just to have some more!< /text>

Always ALWAYS get some waffles (even if it's only the mini waffles as a side when I get 1 of the AWESOME omelettes they have). Service is always great, even when we are seated on the Amigo Spot side. They have a military discount as well. DEFINITELY going back again and again!!</review>

Everyone, from the hostess to the busboy, was very attentive even though the restaurant was packed! The food came out fast, or maybe it just seemed fast to us cause we were chatting away. I'm not a waffle connoisseur but I though the banana nut waffle was fantastic! We'll be back for sure!</text>< pics>

My waffle was cold. I asked for strawberries on my waffle. They came frozen and mushy. My eggs were runny even though i be asked for them medium. The waitress, Lola, was nice and tried to accommodate us but the chef needs a refresher course.< /review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Food wasn't bad. Lots to choose from on the menu. I don't think bacon is necessarily their forte though. If you just want a simple breakfast, good-ish service then this is the place. I had the country fried stake, eggs and country potatoes, which I enjoyed immensely - but wasn't heaven on earth. Don't see myself coming back, but can understand why others might.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We got attended by Macarena, who looked like to manage the place but how she speaks Portuguese helped us in our breakfast, making it easy and even more delicious! The place is near everything and does have a giant waffle to interact with surrounding people. I recommend and for sure would be back again!<//Text>< pics>

I waited two n a half hours for the breakfast and it was worth every second! So if you are coming get there when it first opens! This is the best breakfast I've had in my life! I had the monte Cristo which just was so flavorful and fluffy. The cheese in the fluffy French toast style breading was tasty and went so well with the dish. The sausage links were huge! And there was fresh squeezed lemonade.  I will definitely be coming back here.<//Review>

<Review>Quaint little breakfast / lunch cafeteria @ motel location.  Meals have been consistently pleasant and staff are helpful and friendly.
Parking is easily found and enjoy seeing Sir Wafflelot on the weekends, know many who have taken a picture with the Sir Wafflelot statue out front too.< /Review>< Pictures>

Coming from out of town, This was the worse experience I ever had in my life at a restaurant.  First of all, we go in and they tell us it's a 30 minute wait, then the lady states if u want to get in faster we have spots at the counter so we were like yes whatever is faster...and everyone after us it's a 30 minute wait....we ended up waiting over an hour! The lady kept saying 15 more mins etc. We ended up leaving. What a waste of time.  And the receptionist did not even seem remorseful,  concerned or worried that we were waiting so long. I would not suggest this place. Don't waste your time.< /Review>

Portions were good and affordable. The theme and decoration is very family friendly and entertaining yet slightly ridiculous for adults. The waffle character roaming around outside was hilarious, so overall good vibes. Service was quick for a group of 4.we needed up sitting at the bar because we opted for first available.<//Review>

<text>I waited two n a half hours for the breakfast and it was worth every second! So if you are coming get there when it first opens! This is the best breakfast I've had in my life! I had the monte Cristo which just was so flavorful and fluffy. The cheese in the fluffy French toast style breading was tasty and went so well with the dish. The sausage links were huge! And there was fresh squeezed lemonade.  I will definitely be coming back here.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< user_id>

Coming from out of town, This was the worse experience I ever had in my life at a restaurant.  First of all, we go in and they tell us it's a 30 minute wait, then the lady states if u want to get in faster we have spots at the counter so we were like yes whatever is faster...and everyone after us it's a 30 minute wait....we ended up waiting over an hour! The lady kept saying 15 more mins etc. We ended up leaving. What a waste of time.  And the receptionist did not even seem remorseful,  concerned or worried that we were waiting so long. I would not suggest this place. Don't waste your time.</review>

The food was delicious and tasted fresh
I was a little bummed that I couldn't substitute my multi grain bread for mini waffles but the multi grain bread ended up tasting better then the waffles. We were in a hurry so we didnt really get to enjoy our food as we usually do. The food tasted great, great service, great coffee I just didnt like their booth set up, booths usually have a privacy feel to them but their booths felt like I was a part of the party next to me (akward)...
I would like to go back and try some different  waffles next time.<//text>

We had Monte Cristo and Dungeness Crab Benedict. They were both awesome, but the Monte Cristo...this is the best we've ever had. It's light and fluffy. Amazing goodness!< /text>< pictures>

Great experience! Got a Churro waffle and banana nut waffle in the waffle platter. They were very friendly and quick with my takeout order. Everything was well packaged and delicious. Will definitely eat there again before I leave town. Not jaw droppingly cheap, but very fair prices. Very impressed.< /Text>

Adorable little breakfast place. It's attached to a hotel, which directly reflects how busy it is and/or how parking will be. The food is good, the service is fast and polite.

My only major complaint is that the place itself feels cramped, and not in the cozy way.</review>

Been coming here for almost ten years and love the waffles, but be careful with the waffles. Recently, I was just about to finish my apple cinnamon waffle when I bit into something hard. I thought I had chipped my tooth, but it was a hard piece of red plastic. The person pouring the batter that morning must have been upset with the batter container. I finished the waffle anyway but let the waitress know.<//Text>

Great food, great atmosphere, thought it was going to be another typical hotel restaurant - it wasn't, very pleased and will go again.<//Review>

The service was fast and accommodating, the food was good but not out of the world. The seating can be good if you get in the main room, if you sit in the over flow room, it does not feel as fun/festive for breakfast.</review>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>The prices are the likes of your usual breakfast food chain accept that they have way more choices for waffles which I looove! My waffles weren't as crispy as I'd preferred but they really committed to the blueberry flavor of it. I saw real blueberries in aaand on top which was great. The fried chicken was average - def needed more seasoning other than in the batter but it was still tasty. The staff was courteous and the restaurant was clean. They also provide military and a discount if you're a hotel guest at the Kings Inn. Def worth going back if you're trying to choose between IHOP or dennys not if you're in the mood for a 'new-age hipster' type of breakfast restaurant. :)< /text>< UserId.>

I stay at this hotel all the time, and finally realized they didn’t have microwave in the rooms and it cost 5 dollars to “rent” on for 24hrs. Asked front desk if they have one I could use for one time use was told now. However was told by Kayla to ask Waffle spot and tell them that she sent me. Walked in some man was eating breakfast stopped me I told him what Kayla said. He just told me flat out no and kept on eating his food. The food here is gross to begin with and that man just made it worse. Never again.</Text>

Especially liked their yummy country fried potatoes and chocolate-chip waffle. Great hospitality and service. However, make sure to go a little early in the morning (8AM or so is too good :) ) if you are touring san diego, as you may find people waiting in long queues.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The reviews were great here however the food was less than great. The potatoes were cold, the omlette was drenched in "salsa" more like ketchup. Bummer</review>

Sunday wait was ~30mins.. WARNING: If you say you are ok with first available seating *including* at the counter, you MUST sit at the counter if open even if - as in our visit's case - a table and booth are open. Bogus! Could be like a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode lol. 2. Took about ten minutes wait for drink order, waters came very long wait after that. 3. Took another ten minutes or so for someone to come take our order. 4. Food was a very long wait. 5. I had the bananas and nuts waffle.. there were a great amount of walnuts however only three tiny banana slices slices on top. Cute waffle King mascot out front greeting the public :)<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The Waffle Spot was excellent!  Through a disaster at Orbitz, our hotel reservations were moved across the city to the Travelodge next door to the Kings Inn.  For the first couple of mornings, we passed by the Waffle Spot and poked fun at the over-the-top decor.  By the third day, we stopped in for breakfast and instantly regretted having waited so long.

The staff was very friendly and courteous.  We had some concerns regarding dietary restrictions and they were very willing to work with us.  The food arrived at our table promptly and was just as hot and delicious as the menu portrayed it.  The wait staff was very busy, but they did very well to keep our coffee cups full.

On a side note: we sat across from a table with small children and the wait staff was very flexible with changing orders, side dishes, and keeping extra napkins/water on hand.  I was very impressed.

Stop by and don't forget to say "hi!" to the Waffle King.</Text>

The waitress was not very happy to say the least. After we were seated we waited more than 10 minutes before she came over to get our drink order, she had to leave before she could take our order. The table next to us ordered chicken and waffles, it looked good, so I ordered chicken and waffles. The table next to us was served their meals in 8 minutes, and 2 tables that came in after us received their orders before we received our order. Our waitress never came and checked on us while we were waiting the 25 minutes for our food, watching everybody around us eat. At the 20 minute mark of waiting another waitress from another table gave me some more coffee. When I finally got the chicken it was over cooked and did not live up to the house specialty description I was given. The restaurant was less than half full when we were there.< /review>

We ate there a few times during our stay at Kings Inn. The restaurant is on the hotel premises. I really enjoyed the vintage diner look and the food was great.< /review>

<text>My parents said they had a good experience here in the past, but the service today was very lacking. Servers failed to bring enough silverware and had to be asked twice while the food was getting cold. They failed to fill everyone's coffee before just leaving the table, despite being directly asked for more coffee. When we sat down we had to replace two of the chairs because there was still food on them. The food was okay, but not enough to make up for the lack of service, especially since it wasn't a full house and the servers seemed more concerned with busing tables then checking on their guests.</text><user_name>Kevin Everhart< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

Rube food. A rube is an innocent person, with little street smarts and a bright outlook. This place is intended to capture rubes. Like most of the joints attached to hotel/motels in SD, they really depend on a captive audience, who either walk, or don't know their way around San Diego. Since the stupid demise of Albie's/Adam's next door, I had hoped that this 'Spot' might have something left of the old school, since it has been here a long time. But no...

Waffles that I saw coming out we're uninteresting, at best, and the mini-waffles I chose instead of toast were undercooked and floury. Non-dairy chemical creamer for the coffee. Coffee itself was OK.

For $10.75, the Country Ham and Eggs sounded good (menu on Google Maps said $8.75, par for the course, never maintained), but the ham was as thin and tough as shoeleather. Potatoes were barely warm, and one of my over-medium eggs' yolk was busted under a corner of the ham shoesole.

Service was ok, but the toast-surrogate mini-waffles came late, when I had already nearly finished the rest. Like breakfast dessert.

Not a place I would return to. Nothing exceptional, nothing terrible. One good thing is that they seem to treat kids well, with crayons and coloring placemats.

You won't die. Or maybe I'll need to get back to you on that...</text>

We steyed at this motel for 3 days and preffered to have the breakfast at the motel to avoid timewaste. In general, you can have awesome eggs and waffles here. The people are nice and coffee is ok.
Mostly you have to wait for a place. Me and 3 freind (total 4) had to wait for a table for 4. The first day, we all waited. The second day, me and one firend, we went ahead  to get a place. Our two other collegues were to late. Round about 30 minutes. The girl at the frontdesk let us wait for 30 minutes, even if there were tables for 4. The reason was "she can gave us a table for 4, when all the guys will be there"... This isnt nice!< /text>

This was a good breakfast place inside the King's Inn Hotel. The eggs were great and they have waffles in several flavors including churro, apple cinnamon, and with several different toppings.</text>

Located in beautiful San Diego and nestled in the hotel circle is the Waffle Spot. Got here accidentally since we were trying to go to hash house but was very busy. Only took a few minutes to get seated even though they were very busy. I chose the churro waffle, why not, and added the platter 2 eggs sunny side ip 2 sausages and 2 pieces of bacon. The churro waffle delicious, very fluffy and sweet with a bit of a nice crunch did not need syrup. Customer service was great, always attentive and greeting with a smile. By far my favorite waffle spot.<//review>

The waffles were excellent, one of ua got the pumpkin spice waffle and I got the waffles with chile. However,  there were egg shell pieces in the eggs and the bacon wasn't crispy. I thought anywhere calling themselves waffle spot might want to pride themselves better on other breakfast foods. Also, $3 for tea, which was a lipton tea bag, is a little bit much. The waffle king was there, which was a nice surprise!</Review>

<Review>Hospitality was excellent tha people were kind tha waffles were delicious loved tha diner environment. But... when placing my order i asked if they had turkey bacon or turkey sausage & they didn't have it so for that you get 3 stars. Everybody doesn't eat pork or beef this was tha only place i went to on my while hanging out in San Diego that didn't have it. But tha waffles were gr8.</Review>< pics>

Fun atmosphere for families with kids... food is only OK. A bunch of dishes use waffles in place of other standard ingredients, and no substitutions are allowed.< /text>

Went Sunday at 9:45 am for breakfast, staff seemed overwhelmed, there was about a 20 minute wait, even for counter service - although there was 6 open seats at the counter and about 3 tables opened!< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant with the King's Inn. When I stayed at the Kings Inn Hotel, it was 10% discount and I got about $ 27 after 2 recognition. Waffle was delicious. Orange juice was squeezed like other restaurants.

<text>(Translated by Google) Great variety of food, all pretty powerful. Were always fed until the evening hours, when we had breakfast in the Waffle Spot. Hotel guests at the Kings Inn receive a discount here. We loved Paula.

(Translated by Google) Very good breakfast. At the weekends very many guests and with waiting times is to be expected. Not only the hotel guests from the Kings Inn but also many guests from the area go here for breakfast. Very nice and friendly staff. A very good team!

(Translated by Google) Nothing exceptional but not bad. There are plenty of other restaurants for breakfast that are significantly better in San Diego. We went because we stayed at the hotel and it was convenient.

Rien d'exceptionnel mais pas mauvais. Il y a plein d'autres resto pour le petit déjeuner qui sont nettement meilleur à San Diego. On y est allé car on restait à l'hôtel et c'était pratique.<//Text>
