Went down to Palo Alto to visit some friends and stopped by to get some pizza. The slices were a perfect size. The marinara sauce pepperoni and cheese had really good flavor. The vibe was super dope, to very cool dudes making people happy with their bomb pizza's. Definitely will come back!</text>

<Text>As with all pizza “It's all in the hands!” If the dough and crust aren't perfect, the pizza will be no good but this place gets it! We tried the cheese and the veggie pizza both had great amount of sauce really good ingredients and the crust was as good as any slice I’ve had in NYC! Definitely recommend this place and the service was great too fun guys just having a good time and it shows in the product.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Came in yesterday for a carry out, and honestly I was very impressed.. The manager helped me decide how big of a pizza too get to feed my family and even helped with suggestions on their specialty pizzas
.
I ended up getting the King Kong pizza half pepperoni the other half Mexican style the chorizo was really tasty. I was happy to see they didn’t skimp on any of the toppings- I really got my money’s worth!

And the pizza was HUGE my family was surprised to see me walk through the door with a box bigger than me!

All in all, I had a great experience; the area was clean, the employees were friendly, and the food was delicious.< /review>

Ever since Oasis closed we've been looking for the best white sauce, meat-lovers pie.  This is the place to go. Online ordering is a breeze with tons of options including building your own pies with enormous topping options and even the ability to put ingredients on one half or the other.

I even screwed up an order once, called them, and they figured out my error and refunded me the difference.<//text>

I love your pizza 🍕 and use too love your service till my last order .. the person on the phone was rushing and didn’t take my information correctly, even do I’m a regular customer... driver had my incorrect phone and address and was unable to call me to get information I ended up calling New York pizza, my pizza was terrible cold, they offered me a 50% on my next order, as if with service like that you would want to reorder, but do to the fact it’s the only place with King Kong size pizzas n delicious, we decided to give it another try.. same thing as the person was taking our order rushing not confirm any of the information, we gave up n just hung up cold pizza again no thank you, it’s a shame the customer service doesn’t compare to the quality of the pizza when it’s warm and delicious ☹️☹️☹️😡😡<//text>

Quality New York Pizza  made by the slice! I liked how the bottom of the dough was crispy all the way until the tip. The crust was not bad, but nothing amazing. The cheese was a bit inconsistently melted though. The BBQ chicken had a bit more cheese and it had the stringy texture that I like, while the Super L.A. combo didn't. When I wanted to reheat a slice of my pizza, they were very kind to let me do so. A super slice huge and definitely enough for one person unless you're raging with hunger.</Review>

This is my preferred pizza place in Palo Alto. The quality is better than Pizza My Heart, their delivery guy finds my address on first try (unlike Papa John's), and they're cheaper than most of the nearby competition. If you want a decent pizza without sticker shock nor delivery delay, use this place.<//text>

New York Pizza may have just jumped the ranks to my favorite pizza joint in Palo Alto this weekend. We were having friends over for a few beers before going out and needed an easy dinner. We called for delivery and decided on a large half combo and half mushroom and sausage and a order of buffalo wings. Delivery was prompt and easy. The pizza was still hot and the pizza itself was delicious! I'd like to try some pasta in another occasion. I highly recommend .<//Text>

<Text>100% authentic Crispy thin crust with fresh toppings and savory house made Mariana Sauce.   This place is genuine New York pizza and Ive tried East Coast pizza SO I'm super picky.   Fresh ingredients and excellent customer service.  I forgot to order side of ranch dressing and my driver ended up brining some cause he knows I always order it.  Amazing moms and pops pizza joint with great prices and FREE Delivery!!!  Try them you won't regret it! ❤< /Text>< pictures>

The cashier was  friendly but the pizza I got  was low  quality. I order personal pizza and spicy wings. The wings were  reheated in the oven. I was sick and heavy after the meal. I also was very thirsty after the meal.I ate some pizza and couple wings which I was wandering if they are really natural. Somethings not right. They was also very big. Another thing the cashier  which was touching money and  computer was also touching preparing the pizza (not mine but another client) with out washing hands. I have pictures. That was the worse meal I had for long time.<//Text>

<Review>I like the food here, pizza, pasta, sandwiches and salads, and their prices were reasonable, but they recently raised their prices considerably, so I will be going there much less often.<//Review>< user_id>

<text>I work in Palo Alto.  My coworkers order from new york pizza at least once a week for our staff meetings.  The pizza is excellent, especially the veggie thin crust!!! They are always on time with the delivery and have a smile on their face.  I highly recommend them for your next staff meeting or when you are just craving a slice of new york.</text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
As a displaced former resident of both NJ and IL, pizza and sandwiches are a sensitive topic for me.  The pizza here is good.  Not great, but decent.  I don't say that often.  For now, they have won my business till I find something better, presuming i'm in the mood for ny-style.

I tried a combination (pepperoni, sausage, olive mushroom and something else...) and a shrimp pesto pizza.  Both were pretty good though if I go back i'll probably get lesser toppings.  One thing i've noticed about all ny style pizza's here (ie, not in ny) is their crusts just aren't quite right.  The problem is made worse by the grease in the toppings which saturates the thiner crusts.  I don't really know why this never seems an issue out east... but i definitely notice this across the board here in CA.  That said, this crust held up well, but still suffered the problem.

Their prices are great relative to the food volume, and it feels like a ny pizza place, small cozy and not really meant for you to stay in.  Consider calling ahead and getting it to go.  A pie takes about 10-15min to cook up.</Review>

Ordered for a delivery and they took 50 min to leave the store and then as I was talking to the "manager" he hung up on me. Very unprofessional and I'm still hungry with no pizza.<//text>

Except for a massive slice of pizza, this place is as far away from a NY pizza as the city itself. Guess it's a good option for late-night binge eating.< /Text>

Not a long climb at all! Very steep though. The location was beautiful! But, a lot of people thought so. We were definitely one of several groups of people here to take photos.

Still worth every minute of the wait. In fact. We went here twice because it was so amazing!<//review>

<Text>Totally worth it and super easy to do. The parking lot says it is closed, however, pull into the lot and park near the far-end/roundabout. Someone posted it is closed but that is not true as of February 2021. The hike takes 3 minutes - trail is easy to find and the swing is under the big tree. Once you start hiking up you’ll be able to spot it. Great for pictures - I would actually recommend bringing a tripod but definitely not necessary. Good experience overall.</Text><Time>1612238671084</Time>< Rating>

A easy, short trail from Craig Venter Institute to the shore below.  It goes through a flat area with bushes to a point with good view of the La Jolla Cove.  The two swings there are super popular with people posing on them.< /review>

EXPECT A LINE AND BE PATIENT!  Had to wait about 30min with 5 people infront of me. Everyone took forever to get the "perfect shot" which is why it took so long. I didn't mind waiting but there were others that looked annoyed and inpatient. Nevertheless, it is  worth the wait!< /review>

Beautiful spot. This is accessible by a trail that leads from the side of ucsd to this opening. The trail is amazing and also its flat if you're not much of a hiker this is a great one. It's a great one for everyone.</Text>

<text>Beautiful view but as of jan 19 2021 the day i went there was no longer a swing. It appears as if someone cut the chains that held the swing leaving the attachments on the tree limbs. Some people were still hiking with their dogs. If you go wear good fitting shoes as the downhill short hike/walk 100 yards is a bit steep. I will attempt to go to the other swings to assess the situation and maybe get a swing?< /text>< response>

Short hike from the aquarium parking lot, but since COVID has the aquarium closed, park down the hill where you can find a spot. Worth the trek up! Gorgeous view and so peaceful.<//review>

<user_name>Tim W</user_name><review>Confirming the swing has been removed: it appears the chains were cut about halfway down. There are "habitat restoration" signs placed all around the area. This "hidden" vista became too popular (this Maps pin is one example of that) and the natural habitat has been trampled to slick dirt. I feel bad for the UCSD students who weren't here to enjoy it one last time.

EDIT: Just want to add a note that this "on-again, off-again" nature of the swing is apparently pretty common. Until UCSD permanently fences the area, the likelihood that a swing will be present is a toss-up.< /review>< rate>

Yesss I found it! It is a huge swing, with the perfect message, overlooking the coast and the city. It is a short hike from any parking location but the hike is quick and interesting too. Along the hike is a canyon with some really cool homes on the other side. So far the swing hasn’t been too crowded and it nice to go take a quick snap.</Text>

<Review>Love this little trail, found it by accident Really, didn’t have any reference but a picture, may be a detour but well worth the view. I encourage anybody who’s up for the walk (not Hike) to check it out.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I'm very worried by the number of people congregating here from many different places, including children and groups of 10+, as well as mountain bikers who are destroying significant parts of the trail. Very few people appear to be making any effort to distance. Last year the end of the trail was a field of flowers, today it is completely torn up. Please stay home, and if you are going to come here for a walk, please no groups larger than 2 or 3.<//review>

Beautiful panoramic views, it wasn't too busy only 2 other families in front of us when we got there to take pictures by the swing. After the swing we walked up a little more and enjoyed the ocean views.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Dr. David Larson was very detailed in reviewing the findings of my blood tests and my personal medical information. He went through each finding and discussed the outliers (ones that were outside the preferred ranges) in more detail than the "in-range" results. He offered suggestions for ways to improve the outliers and we agreed to make changes to my diet and to take supplements designed to target certain deficiencies. We will meet again in a few months to monitor specific results/outcomes. I was very happy with the approach.

Dr. Larson is intelligent; charming and has a warm nature to his demeanor that lowers any stress or drama in the discussion of his findings. He is clearly an expert in his field and passionate about his work. I would certainly recommend him to anyone seeking to better understand their health. Especially anyone seeking to improve their mental/physical and emotional wellbeing via a better understanding of their biochemistry.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Doctor Larson and his team are really the most caring and valuable experience I have spent with any medical practician. I have multiple health concerns that we discussed  through one by one together, and his knowledge all across the board outstanding.  We have been able to develop a cohesive treatment plan together, including medications, and equally with nutrition and lifestyle changes. Dr. Larson follow's my progress,  accepts my calls or emails with questions and concerns in a timely fashion and contacts me to follow up with some issues where I needed more help.  I cannot say enough how amazing my experience to finally have a caring involved and informed doctor, he is far from someone in a white coat handing out prescriptions.
Many of my family members are also grateful to have changed primary physician.

these days.  They get to the bottom of the needs of a patient and take the time to know what your goals are and help you achieve them without just throwing a drug at you.  I will always keep them as part of our team and look forward to many years of good health.</Review>< pics>

I am convinced I am one of the most complex patients and it has been due to being put off by doctors for all of my adult life especially dealing with mostly military treatment facilities. I have good insurance, but the doctors that took my insurance were obviously overwhelmed, had a very limited timetable of 15 minutes or less, and I never felt took the time to look at me as a whole and figure out why this were the way they were. Also moving a lot due to my husband's career, my medical history is a piecemeal of records of almost two decades. It got to a point where my anxiety was at an all time high and depression due to that was creeping up, and I just got to the point where I was exhausted. I was exhausted of doctors either patching up one leak, only for another to spring, or telling me it's all in my head (which having severe anxiety I know some of it is in fact in my head), or just shrugging their shoulders. From the moment I walked in, the medical assistant was so warm and friendly and funny and made everything so easy. My sky high anxiety I had driving there was lowered considerably just because I felt safe in that space. I was worried before seeing the doctor that oh man, he is going to think I'm crazy, I've got this list of things that I don't understand going on. But again making it to the point where you feel like you aren't living any kind of life worth living because of the way you physically and mentally feel, the only option I had was to seek out medical care out of my pocket. After reading all the reviews prior to coming, I really put all my eggs in one basket. I am so glad I did. Even after the first visit, I got on my car to go home and just cried because the relief you feel of having one single provider take time with you, listen to you, understand what you are saying, and say we can fix these things after nearly 20 years of frustration and disappointment and dead ends is extremely overwhelming. If you are like me and have "good insurance" (well...Tricare), and you are debating whether it is worth it to maybe give a little more for your healthcare, do it...please, do it. It IS worth it even after one visit. I cannot thank this doctor and staff enough. I am so ready to get my whole body and mind to be the best it can be, and after leaving this appointment, I have no doubt I will be able to with Dr. Larson and his staff's help.< /text>

My experience with Dr David Larson has been wonderful since the very beginning.Unlike any other Doctor that I have encountered he has degrees in 3 specialities:  Integrative Medicine, Psychology and Family Medicine and  he has helped me in all three of these areas! And also, unlike any other Doctor that I have known as a patient, (for over 60 years, he finds to time reach me by phone every week to see how I am doing and make suggestions if necessary. I highly recommend Dr Larson!

Dr. Larson is by far one of the most efficient and caring physicians I've had in a long time. As my primary I have never been displeased with his care, and his flexibility with my fast-paced work schedule is proof of how much he cares about the work he's doing<//Text>

Found this place on yelp, after reading the reviews I called and made an appointment. I was not disappointed. I honestly forgot my groomers name but he did an excellent job on my puppy. He took great care of her and didn't try to rip me off with extra services. He actually called me to save me money on a service I requested but wouldn't have made a difference bc my puppy has hair covering her nails and if he had polished them, you would not have seen the color. This groomer was honest, friendly and knowledgeable in their field of business. I will be recommending them to my family & friends.< /text>

I love this place I've been coming here now for a while all their staff is great. But I want to give a shout out to my groomer Crystal she is one of the best groomer I have ever taken my dogs 2 I moved to Washington but I don't like anybody touching my dog's butt her so I'll wait till I fly in to Los Angeles so I can take my dogs to her I have four and trust me if I'm flying all the way in from Washington to make a special trip for her to grow my dog's you know she's got to be one of the best. Thank you Crystal for always making my dogs feel special< /Review>

<text>Prices are competitive and my dog has only ever been to this groomer since he was a pup. He’s 6 now and over the years the quality of his grooming has decreased.

The last time I took him there he came back with a TON of cuts. Really bad ones mainly around his neck but all over his body including his ears. Sadly I’ll have to find another groomer for him.< /text>< Response>

Please do not bring your pets here if they get anxious or nervous easily at groomers. I had been bringing my Maltipoo here for about two years. Each visit they complained about my dog and slowly kept raising the prices higher and higher for me to pay. My dog's last visit here, he came back a completely different dog. He was sluggish, moved side to side as he walked and then would lay down after two steps. His behavior was very unusual so we called the salon and asked them what had happened since his behavior since coming back was so off. We were scared they had hurt him in some way. Of course, they denied that they had done anything to my dog, so I decided not to take him back here anymore. At his new groomers, I shared what had happened to him at Bath & Furry Works and the groomer said I wasn't her first client who stopped going to Bath & Furry Works after an incident. She shared how her other client said after their dog had gone to Bath & Furry Works he displayed the EXACT SAME behavior as my dog and she stated that they most likely drugged their dog. She shared how this is a typical behavior seen in drugged dogs and groomers would do this to dogs who can become difficult to work with. I am completely mortified that this could be a possibility from how my dog reacted after his last visit here. Please be careful if you choose to take your dog here or just stay away from place overall.<//text>

<Text>I called for first time to get price on my 10 lbs dog and they told me was gonna be $35 then I called few days later and they told me $40 to $50 depending how aggressive my dog is, it's really bad business to have different prices depending in their mood, I wonder how they will proof the dog is aggressive during grooming! I will never take my dog to this place even it's $30 just because they lied to me.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I wont got to any other place to get my dog groomed. If I moved a hundred miles away, I would leave early enough to make my appointment.  My dog always looks so cute after coming from BFW.  What I like most about the agency is that the staff are friendly, my pet's hair cuts last a long time, and he smells great.</review>

Come down Dan ave to the truck entrance. Plenty of space to back into a dock. I believe they will load me under 90 minutes or less.</text>

Truck entrance is on able. They receive between 0500 and 0930. It's pretty cramped and busy between 0500 and 0700. But it's a quick unload and everyone is really nice.< /Text>

< Review>
This harbor distributing company is really bad.
Sales rep is fine, has good beers. But company has stupid policies that you have to order minimum 30-40cases and they don't take back expired beer.
Once your beers have expired, they don't want to replace or resend same beers. So it is your own risk to contract with this company.<//Review>

HORRIBLE Customer Service, VERY unorganized. I had to pay double invoices at times because they were unorganized and very unprofessional. I tried to reach out to CS but they kept avoiding us. HONEST OPINION: GO ELSEWHERE FOR BETTER PRCIES AND SERVICE
Representatives have a bad attitude<//text>

<Review>Outstanding gourmet hotdogs with mouthwatering flavor and all sort of toppings. They also offer fries and burgers and a cool beer or drink and you can sit and watch the ocean and enjoy the fabulous food.

Love me a darn good gourmet Mexican hot dog. My favorite is the TJ doggo. I top it off with a side of their garlic cheese fries before taking a walk down the beach. The staff is always very nice and accommodating.</review>

Never thought a hot dog would be this scrumptious. Made the 50 dollars for four well worth it.</Review>

Last week was the first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the excellent service, with the great  meal and wine and with the modest payment. We will surely come back in a short time.< /text>

<Review>Awesome awesome spot. Not a typo, it is indeed a double dose of awesome. Solid beef dogs and bacon wrapped with a plethora (take that 9th grade English) of toppings to go with. Burgers and shakes look amazing too but I haven't had 10 servings of each their dogs yet to venture to the other side of the menu. In due time!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Was looking forward to eating hereUnfortunately the service was not what we were hoping for.They were rude and had no mannersWe wanted to order a drink but they did not want to even botherTo see if they had any white claws left. It seemed like they did not care if they had our service or not. Overall service was really bad, There’s always a kind way to say things especially to new customers.< /Review>

Spotted this place a while back, but they were closed at the time. Finally had the opportunity to try them, and I'll definitely be back to try more exciting menu items. Friendly employees, and very clean inside and out. Check them out, you won't regret it!<//review>

They had me at bacon!
Gourmet hot dogs right on Seacoast Drive.
My favorite is the Surf n Turf with fat shrimp and carne asada, crispy cheese.
The burgers are great to, as are the garlic fries.
Wash it down with a mint cucumber drink and finish with a pineapple Dole whip. (When the machine is working) Service is always pleasant too!< /review>

It took over 10 minutes to make my hotdog with one person ahead of me so I was a little annoyed but all was forgiven when I received my surf n turf hot dog as it was delicious. The shrimp was fresh and juicy and I definitely felt a lot of care and attention went into a "mere" hotdog. The wait was definitely worth the product and I highly recommend giving it a try.</text>

<username>Cindy Carrillo< /username><Review>Best hot dogs by far ...
My hubby ordered the TJ Dog and I had the Surf n Turf Dog. We both also ordered a cup of corn, everything had the right amount of ingredients for a perfection taste. Last but not least we both had a michelada with Pacífico beer 🍻 and they were to die for.
Best food and micheladas !!
Can't wait to go back for more.</Review>< gmapID>

I don’t always eat hot dogs, but when I do, they need to have bacon. This trendy spot located in the heart of Imperial Beach is definitely the spot to go to for a premium gourmet hot dog.  Their pineapple ice cream is literally out of this world as well. Great spot!!<//Text>

This place has *GOOD HOTDOGS*. Bacon-wrapped regular or jumbo. I had the surf and turf jumbo and the fries were really good. My buddy tried the carnitas dog and said it was awesome. It is also the best seller. There is value here people! Drop in and try the food. Ask for Maya for the best service 👍😉< /Text>

The staff was nice but they don't listen. I asked for a plain burger they loaded everything on it. When I asked them to fix it they just slid the stuff off and gave it back. Nasty af.< /review>

<Text>The BEST bacon wrapped, gourmet hot dogs in town!  This was our first visit this weekend and the hubby and I split the California Jumbo dog (bacon wrapped with grilled onions, shoe string fries, and avocado sauce) and the Surf and Turf Jumbo dog (with shrimp, sautéed peppers and some sort of chipotle sauce). We also shared a cup of elote (Mexican corn) with hot Cheetos!  The hot dogs, soft grilled buns, and corn were ALL very delicious. Can’t wait to try the other specialty dogs on the menu!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg_ML8hBaQcykfxV1M_GaWcfLEHOtsFCbvzEbb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

An imaginative reconsideration of what a hot dog can be.  Was it Mexican, as the name implies?  Well, maybe.  But regardless, it was good.  A very tasty hot dog loaded with onions and peppers, avocado and several sauces.  The fries were also reimagined in a similar way.  And equally tasty.  Just across the street from the beach and one of the least expensive meals on that street.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.< /Text>

Hotdogs and Beer!

You'll be lucky to find a bar where they offer a single hotdog on their menu. This place has 5 different ones! With a choice of classic dog or gourmet sausage, along with many other hotdog centric appetizers, there is bound to be something to satisfy your hotdog craving. They also offer other traditional bar food as well.

I ordered the Sonoran and Carnitas classic with a side of tots. Both were great but don't order two. One is plenty to get full from. The toppings are served high atop a large classic style dog wrapped in bacon placed in soft grilled bun. The bacon could probably have been cooked a little longer for my preference. The bun was perfect, almost as soft as a Hawaiian roll.

The tots were great! Really crispy/crunchy and seasoned with a spiced fine salt.

Service was very friendly, attentive and fast.

I will definitely return to try their gourmet sausage and a pint of beer during a ballgame.<//review>

Very disappointed with Doggogus tonight. Just went there a couple days ago for the first time and the burger and california dog i got were top notch. Me and my wife planned for a few days to have it again tonight for dinner.
Everything was completely different.
The burger had no house slaw on it and the patty tasted of strong overwhelming pepper. The california dog was like a different order altogether. It completely looked like a different dog then what was ordered the other day.
And those poor fries. Just a pure soggy potato noodle. Just pure disappointment. Was raving about to my family the other day and this changed everything. Probably wont be going back again.
Only good part was the service. Very nice people. But very sad food.< /review>

They brought 2 set-ups and about 10 employees making it super easy for everyone to grab food quickly. In addition, only 2 drinks were included in the package we purchased, however, Gustavo and his team brought all 3 available drinks and kept everything topped off. Everyone was super pleased with the food & the quality of the services rendered. Will definitely consider them for any future events.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Absolutely delicious! Had the mutt dog and filthy fries. Both were so good I craved it the following week and got it again. The lobster bun is definitely worth the extra cost. It gives it a crispy texture and adds a nice sweetness to the overall flavor. The bf got the brown dog and house dog which was also good.</Review>

<text>They are at cinco by the Bay and wont take the food tickets for VIP. Ran out of half the stuff, including the bacon and still try and charged $5 for a hotdog. The guys working the stand said the owner said not to honor the tickets for the event.  Avoid at all cost, money Hungary! As you can see its the only vender without a line.<//text>< pictures>

Gold standard CORN DOG, Think of the best freshest corn dog you've ever had, this is better, Staff is very courteous and truly love their hot dogs. A feast for the eyes first, then a pleasure to eat. I've never seen such a beautiful poppy-seed coated bun. Excellent prices and a very quaint outdoor eating area.<//review>

<username>Adam Denton<//username><text>They are at cinco by the Bay and wont take the food tickets for VIP. Ran out of half the stuff, including the bacon and still try and charged $5 for a hotdog. The guys working the stand said the owner said not to honor the tickets for the event.  Avoid at all cost, money Hungary! As you can see its the only vender without a line.< /text>< Rate>

When the Costco food court was temporarily closed up in Carlsbad, Doggos Gus came up and had their food truck set up. That was my first taste of their yummy Baja hotdogs. Now I make a special trip 25 miles away to go get my hotdog fix when I can. Bacon wrapped hot dogs with grilled onions, an avocado sauce, and a spicy sauce. Delicious!< /Text>

The avo egg burger was sooo good. Just creamy when the yolk, avo and sauces mix. I would definitely go to this truck again and get the same burger! The meat and Doggosgus were really good too! Juicy patty and a buttery Doggosgus.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>I attended a Yelp Brewventure at The Lost Abbey and got to taste Doggos Gus hot dog for the first time, mind blown, it reminded me DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES show from Food network. Thanks to these guys for the catering, they took the event to the next level. I would recommend them for the catering for any event, Kids birthday party to Superbowl party.

Doggus Gus was on Fire, making on of the best hot dogs in the town. I will call them for my next catering need. Their bacon wrapped hotdogs was worth standing in the line again and again :)

These hot dogs taste so good, especially with great beer. The caters working non-stop for hours tireless with super energy. I plan on booking them for our next event and praying that my next event will have them :)

I added the extra GRILLED ONIONS on my Hot dog which made extra delicious also Chorizo Mayo with bacon dog is totally worth the calories and the smell of the entire grill is yumm.< /text>< Pictures>

This vet has always been quite complex for me to deal with. But not allowing my pup to receive a 2 month supply of HEART MEDICINE is a joke. I called you all a day before and asked if it could be mailed (because I’ve relocated to SF) but you said I could easily come in to pick this up. I take off work, pay for a not so cheap rideshare, and come all the way to Emeryville just be told she’ll need another heart exam before they’ll supply her meds. You could’ve said this over the phone prior while the front desk allegedly pulled up my file as I was placed on hold for about 7 minutes. And prior to this you always responded negatively whenever I decline an up-sell exam that you’re offering. Very disappointed in you all about this.<//Text>

<text>I have been coming here since they first opened in 2015 or so.
Staff is always friendly, and even more so to my cats. One time the tech took my cat (Taco Jack) into the back room, and from the exam room, I could hear a few voices cooing "Tacoooo, tacooo" to him and it made me smile. My other cat, Pepper, LOVES it there. She seriously enjoys going to this vet. She just soaks up the attention. Also they are the only people that she lets clip her nails.
The care itself is great. I always leave feeling well informed about the visit, as well as my options for care. They welcome dumb questions and are patient with both me and the fur babies. Thanks Emeryville Vet :)<//text>< Pics>

My dog has seen Dr. Sandhu a couple of times for a routine checkup, spay surgery lump and eye infection. I've always received detailed information on her medical condition. The staff has been easy to work with and communicative all of the time. They were also able to squeez me in for a walk-in when I only had an appointment for vaccinations. I intend to bring Shadow here for the foreseeable future.</review>

Very friendly and professional. Went in for some basic grooming needs but regardless I am very particular about where I take my dogs especially when I have to take them somewhere new. As long as I am here, they will be my go to Vet. ♡♡< /Text>

After being with the same veterinary clinic for nearly 14 years, we took a leap of faith with Emeryville Vet Hospital when we adopted a kitten. They are conveniently located to us (only a 5mns drive) as opposed to 25mns across town. And wow, we were pleasantly surprised: the team is very responsive, attentive even when you can only drop off your pet and no access to the facilities. On our first visit, the doctor came out and introduced herself (which was great when you start a brand new relationship). The cost of services are reasonable. Hard to comment on how your pet is being handled since you are not in the room with the vet or the tech, but our pet did not seem to be distraught at all - so one can only assume that all went well during his visits.</Review>

It was my first time taking my pet to this hospital. All staff are super professional and patient, and they explained all your questions about your pet in very understandable ways. They also provide detailed and customized recommendations on how to take care of your pet. Definitely will recommend it!</text>

Couldn’t even make it in. I called and the Receptionist was very rude and didn’t even let me finish talking. She seemed annoyed and kept interrupting me. I was trying to tell her what was wrong with my dog and she was unwilling to help and before letting me talk she said the dog didn’t need to be seen. Turns out my dog had parvo. Thanks lady.<//Text>

<Text>My first visit with my new puppy was much more expensive than expected. When I mentioned my experience to a few friends with pets they said it sounded unnecessarily pricey and advised me to find another vet.

Then, I had an emergency with my puppy. When I called they were unwilling to help and rushed me off the phone because they were closing in 30 mins even tho I was 5mins away. Based on my experience, this vet is not only expensive, but also uncaring.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1604032112800</Time><username>Santiago Tempone<//username>< Resp>

the receptionist was unwilling to talk to us and very unprofessional when we inquired about our dog's details. She seemed annoyed at our questions when our only chance to get to know our dog's well-being was to talk to her, since the doctor never stepped outside to talk to us. On our previous visit, one of the female nurses we spoke to was very nice and talked to us about the prescription meds in detail. But this time, the nurse was occupied with other patients and we couldn't get any info on our dog's well-being from the receptionist.< /review>

<Review>Our dog Larry loves this place! He probably wouldn’t tell you that, but he does. Fair and reasonable treatment and pricing for a family pet. Hard to find around here, and good care for the dog too! Give them a try, we’ve been a few times now.</Review>< Pictures>

If I could leave a 0 star rating here I absolutely would. Admittedly getting a puppy during COVID meant our options were limited as many of the vets we first reached out to were either not taking new patients or were under 4 week plus waits to get an appointment. On our first appointment with Dr. Anderson she did not bother to come out to introduce herself. Both of my parents are vets and this is standard practice even during Covid when a new client is bringing in their pet. During our second visit we waited at the curb after letting them know we were there for an hour, only to find out during our last visit, today. The vet did not see our pup but it was considered a "tech" visit and the vet techs handle that solo. So we waited an hour to see a tech for shots. Today, despite flagging a potential allergic reaction our pup was having  pre shots the techs gave our pup shots. After calling my mom and dad for whether this was sound practice,  they both confirmed they never have only the tech manage visit at their respective clinics and would not have given shots to a dog showing signs of an allergic reaction as she was. My vet visit today concluded with the tech asking me to write down my concerns and "maybe" the vet would give me a call. I am planning to report this to the board of vet medicine and have requested my records now that her (my dogs) initial shot series is out of the way so that I can find a vet and vet hospital staff that actually cares about their clients well being and customer service. If you care about your fur baby, I would highly advise going elsewhere!< /Review>

Pets are family, and my two dogs are my children.

I have two dogs, and I have been taking both to this clinic since Bear was a puppy, so just over 3 years and Leela is about 18 months.

In the beginning, the staff was wonderful, and the vets were so caring -but recently I have had two bad experiences and the most recent happened just yesterday over to today.

Yesterday I brought both dogs for an annual exam and booster shots.  Dr. Anderson reminded me that Leela had a reaction the last time, and recommended that we give her a Benadryl shot prior to booster shots- I agree this is a good idea.

We get home, they both seem fine.  Around 10:30 p.m. Leela stars to balloon up, her poor face is all swollen and she is clearly freaking out.  I first got the paperwork to see if Dr. Anderson left any instruction on what to do, and of course, there was nothing and they were closed.

We then decided to take her to a local Pet Hospital, Sage, and they were wonderful--but pointed out that Leela at 15p should not have had all four shots at once, and especially since she had a reaction once before.  The shots should have been broken up over days to figure out what she was having a reaction to.  They gave her some steroids, and a Benadryl shot and asked me to monitor her for the next two days.

Today, I called Dr. Anderson to express my concerns. I relayed the Sage Dr. concerns and pushed for answers about their practices and She would not take any responsibility and pushed back. I stated Leela should have never had all four shots at once, we should have narrowed down what is causing the reaction.  Her attitude was caviler and borderline careless.

The first incident involved a lot of bad customer service when Leela had to have an emergency spay- I ended up having to take her to a different clinic because they were closed, and their sister clinic by Lake Merit wouldn't make time for us--even though she was bleeding.

There is no way in hell I would take my fur babies back here, If you feel as passionate about being your pets advocate because they have no voice--please take your loved ones somewhere else...</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Worst hospital EVER! My fiance and I took our dog here over a year ago when he had a limp in his arm, it was a little later in the day so they said we would have to take him back the next day and repay for another visit to get him an x-ray. We took him back the next morning, they kept him for the majority of the day and put him in a cast (without our approval) and picked him up with a hefty bill. They also told us they'd never seen an arm that busted up and that he would have to see a specialist to get metal rods put in his arm or he would have to get his arm chopped off. We immediately made an appointment with a specialist but the appointment wasn't for another 5 days. After 5 days of worrying and hoping for the best the specialist told us our dog was FINE! He didn't know what the Emeryville Vet Hospital was talking about, our dog's left front leg is a little cockeyed, kinda like a pitbull, but that's it. The Specialist took another x-ray of him and compared it to the Emeryville Vet Hospital one and he didn't understand why they put a cast on him and told us all of those very shocking and nerve-racking things about our dog's arm. Needless to say we are never going back to this hospital, unless you want an overpriced misdiagnosis I suggest you go elsewhere.</Text>< pictures>

I took a pet there this week for treatment as I'm new to the area.  Due to COVID, my presence was limited to curbside pickup and a phone call.  The treatment went reasonably well but the bill that was presented included treatments that were not discussed during the phone call but were added anyway.  This more than doubled the final bill.  I find this very deceitful and unprofessional.  What a terrible way to treat pet owners that cannot be present in the treatment of their pets!<//Text>

Super friendly staff. When my little one goes in, he's not freaking out. Dr. Keith Harper keeps it real when we need to go in. They are a little on the pricer side.< /Text>

<Text>Emeryville vet hospital is beyond fantastic.  Dr. Harper is the best veterinarian I have ever worked with and I have had many pets over the years.  The staff could not be more professional and helpful.  Best of all our dog who had major surgery is thriving thanks to Dr. Harper's care.  Just wonderful all the way around.  Unlike some of the other vet clinics in the area there is no sense that they are trying to get you to buy products.  Just loving, humane care for our dog.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<user>102392675190597310776<//user><review>We had been reasonably happy with the E'ville Vet Hospital up until recently. The most glaring explanation for the downgrade is that Dr. Harper is no longer working at this clinic. That's a HUGE loss since the guy was a no BS, fair, reasonable, pro. It's regrettably to know this now, and helps explain why things have slipped substantially in the last few months. While the technicians are personable and clearly care about the animals' health (2, in particular, are all-stars), no one knows your name or your dogs name, regardless of how many times you have to take your pet in. In this way, they act more as an urgent care clinic for animals as opposed to a 'primary care' vet office. Further evidence of this is that when taking our puppy in, everyone was totally confused about what treatments were required - to the point that we had to restart an entire treatment cycle that kept our puppy stuck in the house for more than a month longer than should have been necessary. If you don't ask, they won't know what's needed, so you really have to advocate for your animal, unfortunately. The most recent problem is that our dog had a small surgery. When we were still having issues, we tried to get her in, and were told to just do home care. We ended up taking her to a different vet who confirmed our suspicions: the dog had an infection and needed anti-bacterial/anti-fungal treatment. Without this, the dog would have suffered for at least a week. Finally, pricing is not as good as reviews will lead you to believe. You can't go to this vet without paying $100 under any circumstances. At the end of the day, I hate to write a poor review because there are a couple of staffers who don't deserve that, but the operation, on the whole, does. It seems that poor management and lack of leadership are the culprits to what may be the start of EVH's ultimate demise.

October 2020 update: Dr. Harper is now practicing at VetnCare in Alameda. Go there, not because I know much about VetnCare (my only experience with them was a good one), but because that is where the best Vet I've ever encountered practices. Cheers.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I believe the vets and staff here have always been straight with me and have taken good care of all my dogs. Dr. Harper, Sarah, and Jeffrey took time to address every question during our most recent visit. They were also able to squeeze us in the same morning when one of my dogs got sick. Parking is a breeze.</Review>

I have been bringing my cat here since last year and my new dog here for the last few months and I have nothing but positive things to say about Emeryville Vet Hospital. Dr. Anderson and the staff are friendly, knowledgable and show a lot of care and consideration for my animals and myself. They always listen patiently through any and all worries or concerns no matter how annoying the questions may be! The premises are very clean and free parking so close is a huge plus!</text>

Dr. Gill, Dr. Sandhu, and Roxanne were amazing! They're compassionate, genuine, down to earth, no pressure, and competent. I couldn't be more pleased with them. Free and ample parking. Amazing location in the beautiful city of Emeryville. They all took plenty of time to answer all of our questions and be there for us during our beloved cat's last days. They're now taking great care of our dog. They put our pet's interest first without pressuring us into unnecessary procedures. If you're looking for excellence in veterinary care, I strongly recommend Emeryville Vet Hospital!<//Text>

<Review>This is a terrible place same doctors as East Bay vet.  They always over charged unnecessarily.  Charging my aunt, an old lady who does not speak English $180 easily when ever she visited. Pets have die because of them.  My Aunt has an appointment with them, as soon as I heard, I made sure she does not go to this place ever.  They suck.</Review>< name>

I’ve had my two cats having appetite issue. They listened well, already scanned my cats’ medical history, understood what’s my worries, and explained well what’ll be next steps. Also they made several calls after the exam to check how’s my cats doing. I could have asked some questions I’ve had after the visit that I felt they are really care about my cats. +They also called me at the night(7-8pm) to tell me how was the exam result coming out. Felt so relieved because not only I was so nervous for days about how will the result be but also it seemed they were well understanding how pet owners feel.
I wish their lobby to have better rest area for both human and animals but that’s so little thing to complain ;)<//text>

<review>I have two dogs, who both go here. The people are very nice and so good with the dogs that my smaller (70 pounds) dog isn't even worried about going here. The bigger one (100 pounds) doesn't mind going in, but they had to treat him for an ear infection, so he gets nervous when they pick up the otoscope. The doctors are calm and matter of fact and good at reading dog posture, so they back off before he gets distressed.</review>< pictures>

I'm a new customer. I like a Vet that tells me maybe proceeding with teeth extraction is not the best thing to do since my dog is a "senior" dog. That's a Vet I can trust. We discussed it, and I pushed that maybe the risk is less now, and greater later if we do not remove his infected teeth. The Vet was careful and told me what she would do to reduce his risk under anesthesia. Overall, my boy is doing well after 8 teeth extraction, and should be pretty healthy in his remaining years!</text>

The staff is incredibly nice and they really care about animals. Even though our cat hates going to the vet, by the end of the appointment he's always happy to be there.<//review>

We had a great experience with Bigger & Harman, APC.  The staff kept us updated, they were friendly and professional.  They explain everything to us in detail, so there were no surprises.  We did not know what the outcome of our case would be, but we felt confident in the Bigger & Harman Team.  In the end, Everything Turned Out Great!  They really came through for us.

Thanks again,<//Text>

<review>I highly recommend this firm! They were so quick and professional! My son had a 9 year bench warrant for failure to appear and they got it removed AND no fines! They are amazing! I retained them on a Wednesday and they appeared in court for my son that Friday. You won't be disappointed!</review>< pics>

<text>I gave them a five without seeing the outcome but I can already see how they work because of the staffing they have. I really got impressed on how Imelda handled the situation and didn't just end the call thinking "he's not going to buy in" but explained her field of expertise and advise me on why I should get an attorney. I really felt she uniquely was trying to help and direct me to the right direction. She inspired me and reminded me of the saying "Love what you do and Do what you Love" I work in a similar field of helping people after they get into a collision and will definitely strive to help each individual to the best of my ability.  Thank you Imelda and the B&H APC you have a good team leader. 👍🏾</text>< pics>

<text>Mr. Bigger and his firm is the best for solving traffic tickets! I am particularly picky about which law firm represents me as I want the most competent firm at the best possible price. I also had doubts about finding an attorney in central California as I am from the Bay Area and LA. B&H fulfilled my requirements and was very competitive with pricing. Deacon and Haily (paralegals) kept me fully in the loop with the case and provided updates as soon as possible, making them very reliable. Their responses throughout the process was helpful and professional. Mr. Bigger had knowledge that only he would know from his in-depth experience in court in central California which resulted in my 100+ mph ticket being dismissed! If you get a ticket driving the I-5, I cannot recommend B&H enough!< /text>< user>

I would recommend Bigger and Harmen to anyone who has a speeding ticket in Kern County. There is always someone there to answer the phone. They stay in communication throughout the entire process and most of all GET RESULTS. My 100+ speeding ticket was reduced to a 70+ speeding ticket. I was looking at a license suspension, 2 points on my license, and a massive fine. I ended up with no suspension, 1 point on the license, and a fee less than $500. Thank you everyone over at Bigger and Harmen.< /review>

My 19 year old son got a speeding ticket for going 105 mph.  We knew if he was convicted it would severely impact his future.   My friend, who is an attorney, recommended the law firm of Bigger and Harman.   I’m so glad I called them, they were able to get his ticket DISMISSED.  Thank you Bigger and Harman for your knowledge and professionalism and for changing my sons future.<//review>

I can not thank Paul Harman enough for all his help. I had a ridiculous mix up with the court of Lamont regarding my speeding ticket. Since it had been over a year since the ticket was given, I was told my multiple lawyers that it was a lost cause. Mr. Harman was able to take care of it with a breeze in less than two months. No hassle, no mistrust. Showing understanding and compassion along the way, Bigger and Harman are the lawyers to choose! They are professional and efficient. I highly, highly recommend their services! Thank you so much Paul for your help!</review>

If you ever find yourself in a difficult situation involving a traffic violation - Mark Bigger and Paul Hartman are the right team to reach out to. They handled my case with care, updating me at every step of the way and discussing my needs. They were clear in stating best and worst case outcomes but worked diligently to get the best case scenario for my situation. Highly recommend their services.</Text>

Even though I did not know why I was pulled over I started to pull over anyways. However the car behind me that flashed me did not pull behind me which was odd. It pulled up next to me with tinted windows and I couldn’t see who was driving.  It was a plain white sedan with no police markings at all.   10 plus miles down the road this vehicle attempted to pull me over. Concerned for my safety I called 911 to confirm that it was a police vehicle or maybe an impersonator.   I was in the middle of the desert, with no place safe to stop.   Dispatch informed me a that this vehicle  was a Kern County Deputy. So I pulled over immediately. I confronted him about flashing lights at vehicles and not pulling them over or identifying himself. He became very angry and he cited me for failing to yield to an emergency vehicle and speeding which I was not doing.  After he gave me the ticket he made a comment about respecting him. Attorney Bigger fought this case and everything was dismissed. A dishonest deputy was exposed.< /text>< response>

THESE GUYS ARE ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!
I received a speeding ticket coming out of the mountains on HWY 58 around Lamont, CA.  I'm a truck driver and haven't had a ticket in 10 years. My CDL is my livelihood and California's 55mph truck and tow speed limit is ludicrous, only designed to fatten the states coffers.  Attorney Mark Bigger got my ticket completely dismissed!  He protected my license like it was his own.  It's the best money I ever spent in this business.  If your reading this you probably got a ticket too.  They're reasonably priced and will save your backside.  They did mine, and I can't thank them enough.</Text>

{'time': 1605835598984, 'text': 'We have no prior or current clients with this name, or a name that is even close, with similar facts as those described in the review. We have searched high and low for a truck driver ticket case that took a long time to settle and where our legal fee was around $700 (not our normal fee as of a year ago. Our fees vary by court and there were very few courts that required that high of a fee). Mr. Harman and I make it our practice to call every trucker client at the end of the case to explain what happened in court and go over the results. We recall no recent discussions about a case like the one described. Perhaps the reviewer ended up posting on the wrong law firm page? We have numerous tactics we pursue in court. The tactic of delaying a case sometimes works, but it is rarely utilized in the courts that we are in the most. Regardless, we work hard to get the best possible results for our clients and give them a realistic assessment of their case before they hire us to represent them. We communicate with our clients throughout the process, including the end of the case, and the "delay and pray" tactic described in this post sounds much more like an LA traffic mill than a strategy employed by our law firm. My dad is a professional driver. My uncle is now a retired professional driver that used to drive a big rig on the very stretch of I-5 that we cover regularly. My law partner and I work hard to avoid DMV points and CSA violations for our clients because there is nothing worse than having to have the conversation at the end of the case that we were unsuccessful in keeping a truck driver\'s record clean. Sometimes you cannot avoid bad results no matter what you do. But this review does not look like one of our cases, and it certainly doesn\'t reflect the diligence that we give to all of our trucker cases in order to defend them as best as possible.\n\nMark Bigger, Attorney\nBigger & Harman, APC'}< /Response>

I was represented by Paul June 2020 for a speeding ticket I got back in October 2019. I’ve failed to show up to court and my license was suspended. We scheduled a date and Paul got my case dismissed and my license was back on track literally as if nothing ever happened. Thank you so much for the help. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND him and his team. They are the best and truly care for your situations< /text>

<text>I got a very good service from Bigger & Harman. They were very professional and responsive to all of my questions and concerns. I was not sure whom to go for help. I found them via social media site and they were having excellent reviews. But now I am the one who is recommending them. Getting into legal difficulty was not a good experience but working with a knowledgeable and experienced attorney,  gave me a lot of peace of mind and a happy ending!< /text><Time>1591582348963</Time>< userid>

Hi everyone, my name is kuldip Singh. I am a commercial driver and  I had a missing scale ticket. Bigger and Harman was able to dismiss that ticket for me. I highly recommend bigger and Harman firm for traffic tickets. Process was very simple, only I sent them picture of my citation . That’s all. After three weeks they call me and told me your ticket is dismissed. It was that simple for me.
THANK YOU BIGGER AND HARMAN TEAM< /Review>

Visiting family member close to Bakersfield CA, My husband was driving and was pulled over for speeding over 100 mph on the freeway. I hired Bigger and Harman and they kept me informed of my case every step of the way. They were able to get his ticket DISMISSED! They made this process very easy and simple. The retainer was much cheaper than 2 points on his driving record and increased Premium in our Insurance and everything that pleading guilty represented. They are “simply the best.”  I would highly recommend Bigger and Harman for all your ticket needs.</Text>

<text>Outstanding service! Contacting the office of Bigger & Harman was the best thing I could have done. I have a CDL and received a ridiculous speeding ticket while driving in Cali, my employer said if I cant get it dismissed or reduced that I would be terminated!!! I was definitely freaking out but the entire experience from that first phone call was above and beyond. They took care of everything from start to finish and kept me informed the entire way. Of course I freaked out a couple time because my employer kept harassing me and in my point of view it seemed like it was taking forever (6 month) to get resolved. But when I got that phone call telling me that the ticket was reduced to a simple log book violation I was beyond happy. I feel as if my career had risen from the ashes. Yes, some might see the log book violation like a lose, since I'll have that on my record and I still had to pay a silly fine, but it sure as hell beats having a reckless driving charge on my CDL, no job and no one would have hired me. I am definitely calling you guys if I ever run into any trouble again,  of course I hope that dosen't happen! 5 stars all the way!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1594683658846, 'text': "Jonathan, thanks so much for taking the time to leave a detailed and thoughtful review!

Excellent law firm, my "high"  speeding citation was plea bargained to a "non point" parking violation by this law firm. I did have to pay a fine,  my DMV driving record was not affected, nor my insurance premiums.
Highly recommended! They keep you apprised regarding your case.</Text>

I highly recommend going with Bigger & Harmon, they were able to get my case dismissed and I didnt have to take traffic school. This entire firm was a pleasure to work with, the staff is very knowledgeable and are happy to answer any questions you have. I would definitely come back for any traffic related issues!</Text>

<text>I got a speeding ticket above 100 mph along with a rear passenger seat belt violation (as the passenger didn't have a valid ID at the moment). After few days I got a mandatory appearance in the Mojave court and for me it was a pain as I live in bay area.
I did a lot of surfing and found the best reviews and best price for Bigger & Harman firm. I end up hiring them. The communication with the paralegals were smooth, you can send messages/emails and they replies almost instantaneously. They explained how the lawyer will be  fighting this ticket and got extension which gives us better chance of fighting.

The attorney called me couple of days before the trial date and discussed all the available options. Finally, on day of trial the attorney (Mark) called me and informed that he got the ticket dismissed, he also explained how he was able to pull if off. It was a relief as I could have gotten 2 points for 7 years on my record and along with the heavy fine, the high insurance rates for next 7 years. I will highly recommend Bigger and Harman.

Keep the good work going.</text>< Pics>

I don't think they'd do much for you. As if there is a  tacit agreement with the city that a lawyer can get a reduction of they don't push much. The way I see it if you hire any firm in town your charges are likely to be reduced unless you drove 200 miles or something like that. But if you have a nuanced case I don't recommend this firm. Like I said it seems to me there is a sort of balance established over there. If you have a lawyer the judge is a little easier on you and the lawyers don't seem to want to push hard either. So if you did speed and you just want a lesser penalty it might be worth your money. If you really think you were unjustly cited I don't recommend this firm. I did ask them to tell me what the conditions of my case were (and why I was claiming that the fine was not justified)  afterwards and they couldn't. They didn't know any of what I had told them. Clearly, they didn't even take notes. I don't call that diligent presentation.< /review>

Great service A+++. They were able to get my ticket completely dismissed ( grapevine 6% downgrade, 35mph zone). Plus you don't have to go to court yourself, they go for you. Pretty much all you have to do is snap a picture of the ticket and explain what happened and they let you know if they might be able to help you out.</Text>

<text>I was totally skeptical of whether this would be worth trying but I was pretty desperate because I have a company vehicle that would've been taken away if I recieved another ticket.  I was shocked that within the first court date, they had my ticket reduced to a non-moving violation with no point.  I mean seriously.....I have two prior points(for speeding) and they were able to reduce it from a 15 over the speed limit to a parking ticket!!! For the record though, I wasn't speeding ;) lol!  Thanks again for the help, being able to keep the company truck and lower insurance rate saved me way more money than the lawyer fee and  penalty combined! I thanks again to the lady that handled the phone interactions, she was totally nice and informative and patient with all my questions and skepticism<//text>< Pics>

They were able to get my ticket dismissed which is a big plus for me as a commercial driver. Avoided points and the fine and didn’t even have to take time off work to deal with it.

<Text>Called them to help me with a speeding ticket. The people they have answering these calls are sales people with a urgent message where urgent action is needed immediately, yes a sales pitch. I don’t like a sales pitch. I told them they had a high fee to take handle my case and I was no longer interested. Next day I get a text message from the same sales rep. And well, she dropped the price for a couple hundred dollars less. I even stopped their office to see if I could speak one of their attorney’s but still seemed like I was dealing again with a sales pitch. Drove a few miles and found one of their competitors that got my case dismissed for 300$. A lot less than what this firm was asking for. The attorney took my case and although it took a few months he was able to get the outcome I was looking for. Stay away from firms like these. They will steal an extra 400$-600$ extra just for the lead and because they have a dance office with a sales team.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80ea6a20e2a83773:0x423e629f1fe31632< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you have gotten a ticket, I highly, highly suggest you hire this firm to represent you! Thanks Bigger & Harmon, and team!< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Called them to help me with a speeding ticket. The people they have answering these calls are sales people with a urgent message where urgent action is needed immediately, yes a sales pitch. I don’t like a sales pitch. I told them they had a high fee to take handle my case and I was no longer interested. Next day I get a text message from the same sales rep. And well, she dropped the price for a couple hundred dollars less. I even stopped their office to see if I could speak one of their attorney’s but still seemed like I was dealing again with a sales pitch. Drove a few miles and found one of their competitors that got my case dismissed for 300$. A lot less than what this firm was asking for. The attorney took my case and although it took a few months he was able to get the outcome I was looking for. Stay away from firms like these. They will steal an extra 400$-600$ extra just for the lead and because they have a dance office with a sales team.</Text>< Gmap_id>

10 out of 10 would recommend Mark Bigger and Paul Harman. They were easily the most professional and polite attorneys I spoke to in this area and offered me a lower price than their competition. After all that, they used their legal sorcery to get my ticket completely dismissed.

Seriously, these guys are awesome. I cannot recommend them enough.< /Text>

I definitely recommend this office. We had previously met with 3 different attorneys and were given false information. However when calling this office to schedule an appointment, they gave us one right away, went in the same day. Mr. Harman was honest and explained the situation to us, he provided documents to help us better understand. Glad we got an honest person who truly helped explain and took the time with us.<//Text>

Bigger & Harman APC handled two speeding tickets in two different counties for me. One was a misdemeanor, the other was an infraction. It was convenient to hire one attorney for both citations. The infraction was reduced to a non-moving violation and the misdemeanor was reduced to a very low speeding infraction with a very low fine. They kept me informed, usually by both phone and email, of everything as it happened, to include continuances and judgements. Also, they were sure to get me plenty of time to pay my fines. As a CDL driver, it is very important to get these things handled properly. Bigger & Harman did everything I needed, and I didn't even have to be in the same state. Prices were very reasonable for what they handled for me too. You really get your money's worth with these guys. Strongly recommend.</Review>

Just talked to my lawyer today best retainer fee I could of paid period...... efffffffff the ticket clinic for real lol these people will take care of you they Aré honest and good people from imelda to the attorneys. I spoke directly to my attorney without any hiccups when I wanted asked what I wanted with honest attention to everything. I am a class a driver (trucker) got the most unfair ticket in the world but I knew in court I needed help I was so stressed out looking for a honest attorney with great results because I knew tickets with my kind of license will not just go away or be dismissed Easily or at all..... this was 2 months ago now

Today I got a call from the attorney..............

I am clean I have a non point moving violation with just a small fee to pay for the ticket itself safe to say this is a better option than 2 points and a potential never to be hired anywhere DECENT scenario or whatever  the case the officer showed up and the issue was pressed so my attorney got me off without flinching .

Would I recommend?
If you spend your hard earned retainer fee somewhere else your cheating yourself!!!!
Regular driver or super trucker these are the people to call!!!!!!!.

I want to thank the attorneys for working so hard and the people working the phones in the office thank you for everything you guys are the best of the best .<//Text>

I highly recommend this outstanding professional law firm to OTR TRUCK DRIVERS. I retained this law firm after getting a ticket from a DOT INSPECTION at weigh station in LEBEC, CA off I-5 Southbound. From day one of talking with the law firm. There professionalism gave me a good feeling I chose the best in the area. They didn’t disappoint me by no means. They always respond and keep the client informed on everything pertaining to your case. Always a representative to talk to for your concerns if any. For that I’m thankful they won my case! Again I recommend if you have traffic tickets. Go with the best in BIGGER & HARMAN APC!</review>

<review>Got a ticket for the first time in 14 yrs and of course it had to be my first time in California. Got a 60 in a 35mph zone in the grapevine. Hope I said name right. These guys were the first to appear when I searched for ticket lawyers. . Paid a fair price. They did everything for me. Got the call that the ticket got dismissed. If you ask me, the amount was money well spent. That’s a small price compared to the outcome if you have a speeding on your record. Especially 25 over. Last thing us drivers need in our record is a speeding ticket. It was an honest mistake. I had been warned that the whole state was 55 but 60 is ok. Well they forgot to mention that little section of 35. Oh well. Lesson learned. Record is clear for another 14 more yrs. lol. Thanks again guys for your help.  You guys were awesome. With all due respect, hope to never need your services again. Ha ha. But if I ever do, I got your number.< /review>< rating>

<Text>Mark J. Bigger and Paul M. Harman are clearly the specialists in fighting your speeding ticket. Mark is direct and patient. He explained my options until I understood and could tell him what I wanted to accomplish. He is experienced and can help you with your speeding ticket along with the process of reinstating your driver's license. HE HAD MY CASE DISMISSED within the time he said he would. I was so thrilled to hear he had my case dismissed!  I was facing a $900 fine. Don't look anywhere else if you happen to get a ticket in the Lamont or Grapevine area.<//Text></record>

<text>I'm an over the road truck driver and I got a couple of tickets going over the grapevine. And one of them could have cost me my license, and my career, but Bigger & Harman did a fantastic job of taking care of them for me. I wasn't able to go to the court date because I live out of state, but they went for me and handled my case with precision. I'm very thankful they did such a great job. And hopefully I won't get any more tickets in California, lol. But if I do I won't hesitate to hire them again. Thanks again for all your hard work guys, u may have very well saved my career.<//text>< Name>

These guys are the best in the business and know what they are doing. I can speak from experience for a 91 in 70 mph ticket which was my first ticket and I was stressing out because of it, they not only put me at ease and walked me through the whole process of how they would get my case dismissed. The whole experience was great from the moment I called them, I would definitely recommend them as the first choice.</review>

Bigger & Harman would great to work with.  From the moment I walked in the door, they cared about my red light camera ticket.  The executives explained how the process was going to go and at the end of the ordeal I even received a call from Mr. Bigger himself (I didn't even have to attend court).  He genuinely felt bad for not getting everything thrown out, but he did get it down to a no point violation.  No traffic school, no points.  Incredible.  Even if he loses completely, how can I be upset - I am the one that rolled through the red light at 1 MPH (The State of California "is broke." With the money they're stealing from Cali residents off of this - the politicians must be swimming in money).  THANK YOU to Mr. Bigger and everyone that helped with my case.</text>

I got two separate tickets within a couple weeks of each other. These guys somehow got both reduced to non-point violations so my license will stay clean. If you get a ticket and care about your driving record, retaining them is worth the $$.</Review>

<Text>I've worked with Mr. Bigger before. This time, I had the opportunity to hire Mr. Harman for my daughter's traffic case in Kern County. Mr. Harman was able to get a non-moving violation.

I was concerned about this case as my daughter has a fast car, and a hearty appetite for speed. I didn't want her to plead to a moving violation, even if she can go to traffic school, as you can only do so every 18 months.

Bigger and Harman dominate Kern County! I was actually referred to Bigger and Harman by another attorney. No one comes close to these guys when it comes to criminal defense matters in Kern County!<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate><response>{'time': 1520568634259, 'text': "Thank you very much for the fantastic review!

It was nice experience working with Mark and Paul, they are very professional and provided a great deal of attention to my speeding ticket case. They explained the legal process clearly and provided me the updates as we progress on the case.

Overall an awesome experience working with Mark & Paul, and I highly recommend for anyone in need to fight for traffic ticket.<//Review>

The tickets were going to total $1200.00 and points on our insurance, which would have increased tremendously. We hired Bigger and Harman and from that day forward we didnt even think about the tickets or fines. The girls in the office stayed in touch with us when needed. I emailed the information I received from the court and the attorneys did the rest. They went to court to for us which was great we never had to be there to show up. They got both of the speeding tickets down to non moving tickets which mean no points on the insurance or anything against my son's driving record and also the fines total $600.00 instead of $1200.00, amazing!!! I would definitely recommend this law firm for any speeding tickets and hopefully we never have to use them again but if we do, I know they will be there to help!!<//review>< Pics>

I couldn't recommend this law group more! I was being careless and immature and received a reckless driving charge. I have never been charged with a criminal offense so I contacted multiple lawyers to help me handle this. I decided on Mr.Bigger and Mr.Harman because of their stellar reviews and professional attitude. I spoke to both of them and from the first phone call to the final dismissal they kept me updated with the whole process.< /review>

This was our second time working with Bigger and Harman. The service is outstanding. The lawyers go out of their way to resolve the issue. I would again and again return to Bigger and Harman and wholeheartedly recommend their services. -Victor S.<//Review>

<review>I'm a truck driver and when u drive 4 to 500 miles a day your bound to get tickets. I've used other attorney's before never had a case dismissed. My cousin referred me to Bigger & Harman and I can't thank them enough. I expected a reduction if that or maybe a non moving violation, but no they got it dismissed. Thanks Bigger and Harman!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I would highly recommend Bigger & Harman for anyone who's received a traffic violation. I was pulled over and given a speeding ticket while on my way to work, but Paul, Mark, and their team were able to get my ticket dismissed altogether! A huge thank you to Bigger & Harman for taking care of everything in a quick and professional manor!</Review>

I dont know they have such a good reviews
but they lost my case strictly focusing on officer not showing up in court this strategy does not work
not really pleased with their service just beware its not going to be hundred percent success they lost my case explaining me because of officer showing up in court well I am not happy with their service.Just beware there is  a possibilty that they fail.</Review>

<Review>As a firm that practices exclusively criminal defense, we often refer our clients to other attorneys to handle other types of legal matters. However, we are very careful about who we refer our clients to because our reputation is on the line as well. If we recommend another attorney to one of our clients, we want to know that they will receive the same type of dedication, commitment, and expertise that we would provide. When it comes to non-criminal traffic matters, we always refer our friends, family, and clients to Mark Bigger, and we have never been disappointed. When it comes to traffic tickets, there is no one better than Mark. He knows everything there is to know about this area of law, he fights hard for his clients, and he is also a man of integrity.< /Review>< pics>

Thank you !!!
Bigger and Harman, did an exceptional job representing me. Everyone in his firm were so helpful and worked tirelessly to assure me my case was being handled.  My job requires me to be on the road, with a good driving record or I'm out of a job, ( I have a CDL). The traffic attorneys got my citation  TOTALLY DISMISSED, allowing my insurance premiums to remain affordable, and no points taken off my CDL drivers license; in short that means I'm back on the road, and on cruise control driving across the country doing my job and able to support my family!
If you need a traffic attorney, let Bigger and Harman work for you, they get the job done!!<//Review>

I got a 95 in a 55 ticket on the 5 interstate in my car. I searched up traffic lawyers in the bakersfield area and saw that these guys had great reviews. I called them up and they said their price was $500 to represent me, no problem. I have a cdl so I need to protect it. My court date was dec. 18th and even though I was hoping for a dismissal I'm still grateful or the result. They dropped it down to a non moving, "log book violation". Now I still have to pay $489 to the courts for this violation. But I won't have any points on my record, thanks!<//text>

<Review>Well, i did not hire them because mine might be a lost cause , but i liked their personal attention and being upfront. There were kind enough of not raising any false hopes, and told me what i wanted to and need to hear . Please give them a call, it will not hurt :) .< /Review><time>1435782915007< /time>< resp>

As you know, each court handles tickets differently. We give honest evaluations of each case and hope you feel that we did just that when we explained the risks and likelihood of success with your case. While the result was disappointing, work goes on behind the scenes to evaluate the exact situation of the case to be better prepared for trial. Unfortunately, we can't practically or ethically guarantee success on any particular case, what we can guarantee is that we give honest advice and do everything possible to obtain a favorable resolution."}<//response>< Text>
Don’t waste your money on these people you can fight the ticket your self and get the same results they don’t do anything differently I just learned that myself. Go to trial or pay your ticket don’t waist extra money.< /Text>

I absolutely adore my Scala hat. It's beautifully made and the sizing is perfect for me. I have a lot of hair so made sure to measure my head and use the guide. Size large fit just as expected based on the measurements.
The style is lovely and lightweight. I even purchased a gift card for a hat-loving friend</Text>

It’s great to know that you can still get handcrafted hats at a great price (generally $40 to $125) in this day and age. I recently discovered Tenth Street Hats totally by accident and was amazed at the huge variety of styles available (they range from ladies’ beach hats to men’s Cuban style hats to fascinators and back again). There truly is something for everyone’s tastes. I am amazed that the quality of the hats—they feel so sturdy! You can’t find this level of craftsmanship in a typical mall department store, that’s for sure. I am thrilled with the beach hats that I got because not only do they fit well but they stay on during pool aerobics. I get a big kick out of the feature on the Tenth Street Hats site that lets you try hats on, too! A lot of the styles come in a big range of sizes and they let you know how to measure your head on the website when you go to order. The bottom line is: Tenth Street Hats is a company that is a real class act!< /review>

Tenth Street Hats has been my go-to hat store for over a year now. The quality of every hat I've purchased has been top notch, the shipping is always quick, and customer service is always amazing. I love that they always have a mix of classic styles along with new trends. I plan to be a customer for a long time to come.<//Text>

I've gotten great feedback when I wear them. I love the way I look in both hats. My friends say I look terrific in both hats. I highly recommend Tenth Street Hats. My experience has been great. The quality and value are both outstanding. When I look to buy another hat, Tenth Street will be my first choice, they have so many styles to choose from.  I purchased the Dakota hat as well. It fits like a glove. I'm getting a lot of positive feedback from wearing my hats.
Tenth Street has a great selection, well priced, and the delivery is very fast.<//Review>< pics>

I did a collab with Tenth Street Hats on my blog and I figured I would share my thoughts on the hat I received and my overall experience.

Shipping was decent. It took about a week for me to receive the hat. The hat is pretty high quality and they definitely paid attention to detail. I loved that I could choose the size of my hat so that it would be tailored to my actual head. It's also very comfortable. The thing I loved the most was that they put a satin lining in the hat which is great for keeping your hair protected. I'd recommend them for sure if you're looking for a durable well-made hat!< /Text>

I love the hat I ordered from Tenth Street Hats. The quality is amazing, shipping was prompt and the hat was carefully packaged in a large enough box with support, as not to crush or ruin the hat shape. Would definitely order from them again!< /Text>

Edit: I've kept the original review below. However, I want to change my review as this company went out of their way to be sure I was delivered a replacement hat delivered to the correct address before halloween. I believe that quality customer service is paramount and 10th Street hats demonstrated incredible care to make sure the error was corrected. Thank you!

Original: They use the shop app which defaulted to using my billing address even though I specified my shipping address as different. This wouldn't be an issue with 10th Street hats for me as this was a shop app problem. However when contacting 10th Street hats directly to request a shipping address change I was told after submitting an email that I'd receive a reply within 24 hours. It's been two days without response but I did get confirmation they shipped my hat to the wrong address anyway so that's great I suppose. Don't promise what you can't deliver</Text>

The shopping experience and service was exceptional! I loved the hat that I ordered (Santana Credo). I received a Large and it fits so well and the quality is of the upmost highest grade! Plus the details from the hat itself to the hat band were very well thought-out.

Tenth Street Hats are super affordable and very well made. If you're looking for a wide-brimmed hat, Tenth Street hats has it! If you're looking for a cute, sun hat that still provides sun protection, they have that too! Another awesome feature Tenth Street Hats offers is a 3D Virtual Try-On for some of their styles. I will definitely be shopping from Tenth Street Hats again in the near future!</Text>< username>

I ordered my first Tenth Street Hat recently and never have I received so many compliments on an accessory. I don't wear hats too frequently, but the hat I received has inspired me to wear them more often. The product arrived quickly and looks as high-quality in person as it did in the photo. Can't wait to order more!<//text>

They have a wide variety of hats to choose from on the Tenth Street website. I picked a great design, a crushable hat that works great for my travels. The Broxburn is lightweight and packs away nicely and the shape holds up so far even after folding it flat into my backpack multiple times. It's made of soft cotton and looks sharp, I think. I'm really pleased with my choice. The hat was shipped in a timely manner and arrived quickly. No complaints at all.<//Review>

<Text>LOVE this hat. In fact, it's really hard to narrow down a favorite. I need a hat that looks good and protects me from the sun so I got a straw hat. I can't wait to get a new one for fall, winter, and next spring! I have the Bagatelle and it's going everywhere with me this summer.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi1yetV-ypLiygCcFPxXN1RAEjZVWSPdG9Vdoz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

The AI feature is pretty cool.  Virtually got to try on hats to see the styles.  My order arrived earlier than expected.  Email customer service follow-up on receipt was unexpected and nice.  Hat looks and fits great.  Recommended the website to many friends already.</Review>

< Review>
Traveling is also something we absolutely love to do and we do it often – far and wide.  It isn’t so easy to bring a hat box with us on a flight all the time though so we need to bring hats that travel well.

The answer is the Dorfman Pacific Cotton Safari Hiker Hat!

This hat has the following details:

Garment Washed Twill
2 1/2″ Brim
Water Repellent
Faux Leather Band
It fits well and comfortably!  This hat is available in six different color choices – black, putty, bark, charcoal, khaki and olive.</Review>

The quality is outstanding - it's very sturdy and feels very durable, yet can be folded or crushed to pack (I got it for a beach vacation). The style is really classic, so I know I'll wear it for a long time. The best part was the sizing inserts that were included,  which I really appreciated since I have a small head. Now it fits great!< /text>< pictures>

Buyer Beware. I bought a hat on June 23. A month later it hasn't been received. They do not answer their phone, they replied once by email, then never heard from them again. A great place to purchase a hat if you want to have your money stolen. Really disgraceful customer service.<//Review>

<Text>I love the quality and craftsmanship of the KATHMANDU designed by Santana.  It is the perfect winter accessory and adds an extra pizzazz to my outfits.  I never considered myself a hat person until I came across some of Tenth Street Hats designs.   In addition to the KATHMANDU,  I love the design of the Quito, a hand woven genuine panama hat.  I  look forward to warmer months so I can sport the Quito with my summer wardrobe.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The hats at Tenth street are the highest quality and super affordable. I picked out an amazing hat for myself and also was able to find some great gifts. The website was so intuitive and the customer service was friendly and super helpful. I love Tenth street!< /review>

<Text>They have the best hats! The quality and style of their hats is incredible. Tenth Street's customer service is so good as well. If you are on the fence about getting a new hat, I would highly recommend Tenth Street. Very knowledgeable about hats since they have been in business since 1921!<//Text>< username>

I’ve ordered a few different styles from this company and I love all of the hats so much! They’re really well made and fit perfectly. I had never before ordered a hat online but will continue to do so from 10th St since they fit exactly as I had hoped.<//text>

I WAS NOT a hat guy, but I’ve become one through Tenth Street. I didn’t even know my head size or what hats would look good. The measurement directions on their website were exactly what I needed to figure out my size and select two Stacy Adams hats (one white one black). My first hat was a gift and I was surprised at how much I liked wearing it out. Gotten a lot of compliments and plan to get another soon.</review>

This past Easter my husband wore the 'Calistoga' hat designed by Scala and he loved it! It is a fedora style, straw hat and the colors are perfect for spring. It is Ivory with a blue, red, khaki,striped band. Also the fit is sized perfectly. You can go up to XL! We both were impressed at how well it is made and the customer service tenth street hats provides. Plus they have so many awesome styles for both men and women at great prices.<//review>

I am in LOVE with my Anvi floppy felt hat from Tenth Street Hats! This is seriously the most perfect accessory I currently own. I love how comfortable it is, lightweight and yet substantial enough to block the bright sun. It can dress up a pair of basic denim jeans and tee or add the perfect touch of boho style to a skirt and boots.  Tenth Street has tons of style and material choices - I can't wait to add a few more to my hat wardrobe!</Review>

Needed a classic, subtle - but swaggy hat for a destination wedding in Cuba. Naturally, I ended up getting the "Havana". I followed the size guide provided, but the hat was a bit too tight (to be fair, I fell in between a small/medium - a smedium if you may.) I contacted Ariel - the "fit specialist" -  he advanced and rushed shipped the next size up so I had it in time for the wedding. Easily the best online experience I've had with a return...will buy all my hats here moving forward. Highly recommend! Can't wait for the photos from the wedding rocking this!< /Review>

As a longtime hat aficionado, I can say without hesitation that I love Tenth Street Hats! I have my fair share of designer toppers (Louise Green Millinery, Rag & Bone) but I can get the same quality with Tenth Street for a fraction of the price. Plus, they have great customer service and a return policy that's even better than Nordstrom's! (FYI, the hat in the pic is the Namib safari hat.)</Review>

I'm crazy about these hats. I keep finding reasons to get more of them every time I have an event. I love the quality and the styles, and their customer service is insane. I would never buy from another brand. I'm obsessed!</text>

Love Tenth Street Hats. Their hats are stylish, modern, sleek, and yet still affordable, unlike a lot of hat makers and stores I've experienced. The safari hats are my style...< /review>

<Review>I have been with CSIS Insurance for well over a decade and I have to say, they have never let me down and always had my back. I am very pleased with their customer service. With any issues or concerns, CSIS Insurance always works with me to resolve them in a timely manner and help find affordable solutions. It was a pleasure receiving assistance from Erika Garcia. She handled all my inquiries regarding my insurance coverage very professionally and respectfully. I appreciate your services and I look forward to continue doing business with CSIS Insurance.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Joseph was amazing! I came in 30 mins before they were closing and insured me that it wasn’t a problem. I was in and out within 15 mins. Joseph was so nice, very helpful, and actually made genuine conversation and not just trying to fill in space while he did his thing. Highly recommend stopping by and asking for Joseph.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1624390074596, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words!'}</Response><gmapID>0x80c33148925e604b:0x6970356eb0888678</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My husband and I are currently in process of buying our first home and we called out to different insurance companies to retrieve quotes. All the companies we called were automated calls which made it hard to figure out what was needed. I reached out and spoke to Joseph Jimenez and he was beyond helpful. He was easy to talk too and he answered all my questions that I had. So of course we continued to do our business with him.  Ask for Joseph for all your insurance needs. Thank you Joseph for your assistance.< /Review><UserId.>115772225878069185357<//UserId.><Rating>5</Rating><Response>{'time': 1611003768232, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words!'}< /Response><username>Joanne Do< /username>< gmapID>

Sylvia Jimenez exemplifies what a Protection Specialist should be... The level of customer service Sylvia provides is absolutely amazing. Her attention to detail, extraordinary... She is so knowledgeable about the business and yet makes it understandably accessible to her clients. This review was effortless, due to the apparent actions Sylvia takes on behalf of her Clientele. Thank you Sylvia.<//review>

Second: Convenient telephone service.  We rarely have to visit their office and when we do, it's professional, well organized and prompt!
Third: Low and very competitive rates.  CSIS works hard to find the best rates and coverage.  Very prompt and helpful in securing adequate and low priced coverage.
Now,update: CSIS helped again! Fast service.

I recommend CSIS to all my contacts!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>The only reason I am still here is my agent Raul.  He understands my needs and helps attain them. Otherwise with a yearly increase from Mercury for no apparent reason that usually exceeds the cost of living is beyond me.  I don't like that.  I was with Allstate for 35 years. First agent was great for 17 years and retired, second agent was great for 18 years and retired.  Third agent was very good but grew his business so big he lost touch with some clients, his staff did not treat me to what I was used too. I reached out to the original agent and he was too busy to talk to me.  I was referred to Mercury and Raul has been spectacular in spite of Mercury but l will probably leave Mercury by Spring.  Good drivers, multi vehicle, no tickets, no accidents, no claims, homeowners insurance and still increases every year that are generally way above the cost of living. Very disappointing.< /review>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1581010741199, 'text': 'Thank you for candid feedback, Mr. Alvidrez.  And thank you for your kind words about Raul, the agent that helped you here at our agency. As independent agents, our agency represents over 30 insurance companies. Mercury is one that that we have worked with for 50 years, since our agency started back in 1970. The unfortunate thing is that all companies, not just Mercury, over time need to increase their rates to keep up with inflation, the high cost of repairs and medical expenses, and the ever increasing cost of litigation and lawsuits. We understand your frustration. We are consumers too and like you, we look for the best rate we can get.  As you said, Raul did an excellent job at looking for the best combination of low rates and  coverages adequate to your own situation. In your case, Mercury still offers you the lowest rate we can find you, again from the more than 30 companies we represent.\nI want to personally thank you for being our valued client. We know you have many choices when it comes to where you can purchase your auto and home insurance and I want you to know that your business is important to us. Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or concerns you may have.\nMy direct line is 714-602-3114 and I am available 9 am to 5 pm.\nI can also be reached by email anytime at joe@csisinsurance.com\nMr. Alvidrez, we strive to achieve a 5-star rating in all our reviews and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss with you how we can increase the 2-Star rating you have given our agency. As you know, we have no control over the rates companies charge and I hope you see that our agency has done our best to help you find reasonable rates.\nRespectfully,\nJoe Jimenez/President.\nCSIS Insurance Services.'}< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c33148925e604b:0x6970356eb0888678< /GmapID></record>

My experience has always been great, I get excellent service never had a problem. I have always worked with Raul he is my to go agent! I been his customer for over 12 years now, since my first car, then couple other cars, and last year with my home insurance!!! I now live 60 miles away from CSIS office and I can’t see myself going to another agent!  Every time I call or go in he has a smile and shares special life events and I share mine! It’s more than a business connection is more like a friend feeling and I trust his recommendations! I will keep on going to him as long as he is there! He is a great asset to this office!!</review>

If you are looking for a professional team to help you with your insurance needs, CSIS is the place!  I have been with CSIS for close to 20 years and have always been happy with the service they provide.  My most recent encounter was with Adeline.  When I failed to submit my odometer readings, she reached out to me right away to obtain the necessary information so that my insurance would not increase.  I currently have two autos and home insurance through CSIS and am very happy!</review>

<text>Joseph at CSIS Insurance was incredibly helpful and was able to setup my renters insurance very quickly and was even able to get me a little extra savings! I was in a situation where I needed to sign a lease and move in 3 days and I called him and he set me up and sent over the paperwork the same day I called. I highly recommend working with CSIS Insurance!</text>< pictures>

Sylvia Jimenez has been my agent for many years and she always makes sure I am getting the best rate as well as the best coverage, she is very knowledgeable about insurance and responds to every inquiry with a sense of urgency. Her customer service skills are superb and I refer friends and family knowing that they will get the same level of service.</Text>

I was 21 years old when I became a CSIS client.
I am now a bit older .. 50 something .. and I’m still a loyal client!
We have been through a lot together and I wouldn’t change a thing!
Here’s to 32 years of being a loyal satisfied  client!</Text>

I called to get new auto and home insurance and was very pleased with the great customer service! Joseph assisted me and helped me through the whole process, not to mention I did this over the phone and it was extremely easy because of how detailed he was. He was also very attentive and answered all my questions thoroughly. Joseph is very professional and efficient! I will definitely recommend CSIS to all my friends and family.< /text>

I have been a customer of CSIS insurance for auto and home insurance for about 13 yrs. and have always been so happy with the customer service and professional assistance I receive.  Most recently Adriana Donoso has helped me and its been such a pleasure. She is so amazing! She quickly resolved my issue with my homeowners insurance and corresponded with my mortgage company to fix the entire issue!! She handled it all for me and even made a change in my policy within minutes!! So pleased to get such awesome service!!!< /Review>

<text>Vanessa at Mercury Auto Insurance was very helpful to explain the changes to be made on our Auto Insurance Bill.  Every person answering the phone at  Mercury is very helpful and they explain (in detail) the process that we need to complete to make any additions or changes.

My insurance agent is Raul Perez and hands down a great agent; explains and went over the policy well while providing top notch competive insurance rates and coverage compared to AAA and Allstate. When I asked for some paperwork to give to my credit union, Raul helped me fax and send information to my credit union which makes comfortable and easy on clients, would recommend Raul.</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1573857668766, 'text': 'Hello, my name is Joe Jimenez and I am the president at CSIS Insurance. Unfortunately, this gentleman\'s Insurance policy cancelled for non-payment.  When his wife called us she wanted us to reinstate the policy retroactive to the date it was cancelled.  When she was told we were unable to do that, her husband, (I assume "Ticob Tucan" the person who wrote this review) got on the phone very upset and started calling us all kinds of insults.  I am the person they spoke to. I simply repeated what I told his wife, that once the policy is cancelled for non-payment of premium, we cannot go back and reinstate it without a lapse,  that they needed to start a new policy.  As anyone can see on his review, he went off and made all kinds of false allegations. I speak Spanish and I personally spoke to him and his wife. This is just the case of a person who just forgot to make a payment and then wanted to have special rules to correct their mistakes. Unfortunately, we cannot make individual exceptions. Like any other insurance agent, we need to follow the company\'s rules.  If there are any questions regarding this review, I can be reached at 714-602-3114.  Thank you.'}<//Response>< name>

If the rating could go negative these guys would win the prize.
The insurance is mediocre and the service is trash. They have no diplomacy for customers and lack professional ediquite from staff.
Beware if you're not an English speaker and don't have much understanding of insurance lingo. They will take advantage of this and additional fees will accumulated. As a third-party insurance they have no obligation in assisting the customer. They will simply cash in the sale and  turn their head the other way when things get complicated.
They lack backbone as a company and the leadership is weak, beware. Y si hablas español asegúrese que tenga asistencia de otra entidad que explica lo que estás firmando.</text>

<Review>Really extraordinary grocery store. Good variety, excellent prices, and the quality of raw ingredients is sublime. Best butter in town, excellent pasta selection, etc. Also a phenomenal meat selection — very fresh and high quality and you can find all kinds of meat that most stores don’t stock.</Review><GmapID>0x80d9571089292247:0x26eaf07e05112468< /GmapID><Rating>5<//Rating><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<Review>I've been shopping here for years and it keeps getting better all the time. Love the pre-packed meals and salads. Their meat, chicken and seafood is always fresh. They carry organic produce at  great prices. Great supermarket if you love Middle Eastern food and groceries. They also carry Russian and other international products. Cashiers are always friendly. Love this place!!<//Review>< resp>

Be aware if you care! Read the labels carefully before buying any product. If you notice the product is Made in Israel, do not buy it. They've been importing products from Israel and selling them in their store.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Best market in La Mesa, the Deli has an awesome selection, i highly recommend the smoked Gouda from there, they carry middle eastern products and Russian products as well, with awesome sweets from both cultures.

Hit up the meat section and get the best carne asada in San Diego, heat up your grill on high and  one minute on each side and your in business.

Really awesome place, highly recommend</text></record></dataset><record>

Good variety of items if you are into European and Mediterranean foods. But be aware, always check expiration dates. They keep them on the shelves hoping to sell, Multiple times pointed expired items to the employees and weeks later items were still on the shelf. Also they constantly fail to follow marked down prices on sales and double scan items. But i like the place, it just you have to be aware and check your receipt.<//Text>

Great place to find deals on olive oil and middle eastern products. Just don't buy Dolma! It's not fresh made. They put the canned Dolma in plastic and sell it for $5.99 for 23 pieces.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Love shopping at this store. The meat is extremely fresh with a great deal all the time. If you're looking for a hot or cold and fast lunch tray the options are delicious. The made to order sandwiches are some of the best I've tasted. You looking for fresh lamb or Turkish delight then get down here. Didn't get a picture of the Turkish delight but believe me it scrumptious 🤗<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1pzaaA4oxh47bLeqtaRWaOKBVjF0zMWDYfLHp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHZUkZnYq_C7JpbxSTfeJ-olz33Qsq_v1P14mH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1UJDPVMiOLcivE0EtpzpXvp3kXDnOiV_SuKki=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkMc0da11vFU08wr6Wu5cOU1EWXTPkv-ql9NPW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIQoBZvoGyuNUNI05blFor6f_Zc2NEx92mPOAL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiXzDY-FYragjJtV3nZaRpz9H_eVQi7tRSZSqs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWzWjlk4nrz_9uhS4JWYHQF1_nFJ0t8e1_4eI8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJRweyE0Dgm70QpsVGpkVdPiUdBj9rB0P0k3p2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2uTFenCP-Y-KK-OcepLtzbj74zfnaVkEWgpXm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObIsxxbvy27bIgInXoUwc1-53Nf9D0Qn34nLML=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy7lXrR6LuILOcMsTAlv85VUp_qHwIip1RSxb8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6PVBs_e_77-j0auUq36y8BKztJlIVfVZARcNG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Exotic yummies that are pocketbook friendly!  I really enjoy shopping here.  Its clean,  well organized,  has lots of organic produce,  the prices are very fair and they have a wonderful selection of edibles for those of you who are interested in cooking up authentic (mainly Middle Eastern)  cuisine.  There are several Russian,  Bulgarian and Italian products as well. This is also one of the few places that I know of that sells Boar's Head brand of meats and cheeses, so its another major plus.  Although I am not too fond of their bakery (I've found that they look much better than they taste but that is just my opinion),  their deli has hot meals for take out that is very tasty.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful.  Definitely gets a 5/5 from me 😊< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEoKDK-W4B5PpsMwvhqDSiCjdkyyXH6zLyMylf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlPkmp9ZBCvqrVpdVVtb87J3wDvvoQQtCYI6YL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONpeTrYZP5mzILqPYwlgkBk1cxIb_DhJKLyIrQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCQPZCHHrQJbedGroPHcLkvBcVIHSf5KsVKtss=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYgUCnm7R6wqPLM4OvXcRji8mLtB4JK0VcGanV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvVp6loDujOeHn99ZakxNuqXKe-xyRjARs5CS-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5VnFpqfQJ7NJmNOjSvZ0EqVkzBSQ28nhyG9Bu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4sKGXF_8_Oz4oPAlV20aRI_kmsUGCCMwD2KQ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxj5lGat0MaYFa1HhaxEqTewUPHRNNVQc8P7pt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRD-4iFfeZelU55559Ge0p6WMplNsNbr4ax-rv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD5tFcCthNNFOuz9nXW2Sd0mpB8jlVb5h4vyFZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND1XgwxEiIsBI_NN4bPD2gdXCBwImn_SbSBjOx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNF1T9LzjKVbAsENbGjPmRa_eQ70P4RqVtKOjI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvTVoF6aV6vgmgvwNTk2FItCJpjRKsHt_CltT_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Hygiene is a big issue in this market. My wife and I have been a customer for some time and our stories started to stockpile. Meat was rotten many times, so we stopped buying from the meat department there. Then cheese was rotten, and we stopped buying cheese. Once I saw a mouse running in the store. So, we stopped buying anything that had their own label and stuck to the imported things. But then we found bugs in the flour many times. We have quit being customers there after we had one complaint and they handled it in the most unprofessional way possible. If you look carefully behind the shelfs, the bathroom and peak into their back areas, you will be disgusted. I recommend Frazier Farms Market which is a couple hundred feet away where you can buy almost the same products. It's a little more expensive, but you can save yourself some stress and health issues.< /Review>

Staff is very friendly, however, I believe my experience is only a 4 because of my expectations. I was looking for certain items thinking it was like a sprouts or a similar market. However, when I learn how to cook Middle Eastern food properly, this seems to be the spot for that. Unfortunately my curry skills are lacking, but they may have some cookbooks I missed. Staff was very friendly, I just wish they had more organic produce though. The deli looked really good and may come back and try that.< /text>

<Text>[Update 2/21/21]  This visit compared to the last two was so much better.  It probably helped that the person behind the deli counter knew who I was and that it was me who left a negative review.  This was evident by her comment at the end of our transaction.  This level of service is what I had gotten used to which was why I was surprised when it tanked the way it did.

Management had reached out to me and stressed that they strive to give their best. They laid out what was going to be done to fix the problem and voila, problem solved.  I probably should've ordered the same sandwich as last time but ehhh I wasn't in the mood for it

Kudos for making customer service a priority.  This is something other stores have let fall on the wayside and fail to recognize they are just hurting themselves by alienating us.

--------------------------------

[1 Star on 2/15/21] It's sad that I have to write a bad review about this place given that I was singing its praises not so long ago.  Unfortunately, two separate incidences in the same department have made me weary.  I didn't report it the first time on here but I did at the store to the front manager because the manager that handles the back had already gone home.  Anyway, my bad experiences take place at the deli counter.  The first incident was back in January.  A woman with black and blond hair was the attendant.  First, it took her more than 5 minutes to recognize she even had customers lining up.  Then when she finally did it was with an attitude.  I figured she was just having a bad day and I ordered my sandwich and side and did some more shopping since it takes them a while to get it together.  I come back for my sandwich 10 minutes later and she's still not finished.  I wait 5 more minutes and she gives me the sandwich but no side.  I had politely asked her to give me a side of antipasto salad I believe it was and she looked as if she wanted to kill me.  So much so that the other customer looked at me and asked me, as the attendant turned to get the container for the side, "What did you do to her?".  I replied, "I just ordered a sandwich."  Then to top it all off which I hadn't noticed until I got home, I got charged $7.99 for the sandwich and $3.99 for the side which was supposed to be included.

Anywho, skip forward to Saturday (2/13).  A new person is behind the deli counter and I order a Tri-Tip Feta sandwich on Foccacia bread.  Right away I noticed the person didn't know what to do, so I told her I'd be back.  I went and purchased some meat.  The guy behind that counter has always been friendly to me but it's busy, so I waited for my turn.  In the meantime, I note that the deli person is taking care of 3 customers while I'm getting my meat.  I go back to the deli counter after getting the meat and now the person is on the interphone, which I'm assuming is to ask for help.  Someone finally shows up and meanwhile 3 other customers are being taken care of.  It took 21 minutes to finish 1 sandwich and to top it off, it was salty as heck.  By the time I got it home, the bread had fallen apart.  It was sooooo sloppy!  Never again will I order anything at the deli counter and if I have another bad experience, I may not return to the store at all.</Text>< pictures>

I'm from Europe, and in this store I'm able to find bunch of goodies that remind me of home :) Definitely worth 20 minute drive to get there. Plus, the staff is awesome! Great guys! I don't know the name of the person who was grilling the chicken outside, but he helped me to properly choose a ripe watermelon (you know how you need to spank it to determine if it's ripe or not). Thank you!</Review>

<Review>Overall  a small local market with good prices and convenient deli and bakery. However, poduce can be hit and miss.  Some of it is very good and well stocked such as eggplant,  onions, potatoes, and cucumbers.  But citrus, apples, tomatoes, herbs, and others sometimes give the impression that they were not that fresh even before they were stocked.  Produce typically has some blemishes, which is ok for the price reduction trade-off.  But over ripe or lower quality items will sometimes have you making a trip another market on the way home.

Prices are typically lower than supermarkets for most items.  I have had very good experiences with butcher, bakery, and deli departments. One of the few places to find fresh dark breads.  If you need something for an eastern european or middle eastern meal then this is a great place to shop because of the variety of brands and ingredients.  Bonus points for dried spices, bulk bins, good cheese selection  (several styles of feta) fresh squeezed juices and prepared meals, fresh salads and various fresh dips.< /Review><user_name>Zoyd Wheeler<//user_name><user_id>113054805744397671577</user_id></record>

<review>Its a mixed bag at times. Sometimes the food is amazing and you have yourself amazing deals from different countries such as Russia, Morocco and even India. Other times you have spoiled food and they dont seem to care. On top of that their German bread always seems old and stale.
Wish they would also be more in stock with churchkhela. They seem to buy random things and hope they sell.< /review><user>101158005154865603295<//user><Time>1604403166056< /Time><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>3< /rate><Gmap_id>0x80d9571089292247:0x26eaf07e05112468</Gmap_id></record>

This place is great for fresh produce at affordable prices. They have unique items imported from eastern Europe, but don't stock some of the items you would expect to find in an American grocery store. Definitely a shop worth checking out.< /Text>

< Review>
I love the store. It has a great selection of foods if you're looking for mediterranean recipes that you might otherwise only find in to her countries. The restaurant that's attached however I did not like, they gave me spoiled tahini sauce when I ordered a rice and meat bowl there. How do you have and serve spoiled tahini sauce when youre right next to a market and can make a fresh batch? The food was bland anyways , even fresh Tahini wouldn't have helped much, but the sauce was clearly rancid the smell was horrible and I'm concerned that not one worker cought it or even worse might not have cared.<//Review>

<review>Vine Ripe has improved their quality of produce and continues to have fair prices. However, their checkers don't always know what's on sale. That said, you need to double check the register because they often ring up the wrong price.< /review><UserId.>105558372254231062722</UserId.>< pictures>

A broad array of Middle Eastern food items and a smattering of Russian and other ethnic foods. Prices are reasonable on many items and above average on some items. The grill is now in the hands of Vine Ripe and reportedly doing well (although somewhat overpriced). A few bulk items, a full meat/butcher section, and a bakery specializing in Middle Eastern delights fills out this beloved area market.< /Review>

<text>Large selectiton of good, reasonably priced produce. They have some items you won't find in other stores. They have an in-store bakery, deli, and butcher shop. During the weekend, and perhaps weekdays as well, there is someone out in front of the store, grilling chicken and beef, available to purchase by the pound.

Vine Ripe Market has a wide variety of quality produce, many from local sources, a good selection of organics, as well as fruits and vegetables commonly used in Mexican, Russian and Middle Eastern cuisine. The people who work there are friendly and helpful. They have a delicious selection of different varieties of hummus and fresh salads.< /Review>

I love this place! No one can beat the prices for produce here. Everything made in the deli is fresh and delicious. The restaurant next door is amazing too. Here's a tip, when buying get stuff from the bottom for the freshest options. They rotate everything everyday .

< Review>
I love the Middle Eastern & international variety of products at this market, and friendly service too.  The bakery & prepared foods are so good... I just wish they hadn't taken the ground beef out of their eggplant dish, but it's still delicious.  So glad their "grill"/eatery just reopened... can't wait to stop by again for a Schwarma or Kabob plate. 😋</Review>

This place deserves 5 stars for its bakery, deli and butcher.

But they carry shady products that deceive consumers like Ennio "avocado oil" which actually 90% canola oil.  But ots labeled fraudulently and as the retailer they should do better to protect their elderly customers.

Selling canola oil for avocado oil prices is consumer fraud and I have reported it to the authorities.

As soon as they remove all Ennio foods I will shop there again and change my review.  Shame.  They should ashamed of taking advantage of people who are older and dont understand.</review>

The produce you need to use relatively quickly. They  do carry both organic and regular They have precooked warm items such as chicken curry vegetables rice Savory pastries and make sandwiches to order. They have a lot of dried fishes and some hard to find ethnic food. They have a orange juicer so you can have fresh squeezed orange juice as well as a selection of other juices both Savory and sweet. They have a selection of fresh cut fruit but I wish they had the coconut which they seem to have anymore. They now serve beer and wine. They're good to stop and really quick or to do all of your grocery shopping at. The one thing is I have more fresh fruit not as much prepackaged food tater< /text><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

You can get things here that you can't get anywhere else like special European chocolates and such, also has a wide variety of different cheeses from middle East and so on and of course a good place to take get pita bread. And remember with pita bread you can always stick a few bags in the freezer and then when you take them out always put them on the fire on the stove for a few seconds comes out nice and warm and fresh just like when you bought it little tip for you.</Review>

incredibly fresh produce and meats at great prices. Hard to find Mediterranean foods and other ethnic foods as well. Friendly staff and always clean. Highly recommend this market over corporate chains. Beats all other chain markets in a heartbeat.< /Text>

<Review>Nice little market, with good prices and selection. Perfect for those who don't want to go through the craziness of big stores.

You won't find as much variety, but if you eat healthy (i.e. nor only processed foods) this is more than enough.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The reason I’m giving one star is because of the cashier named “Mirna”
Rude, asks me what the item is !  Cause she doesn’t know the code for it!!
I still have mire stuff to scan, she jumped to the next customer greeting them and I’m still standing waiting for her to realize that’s my stuff!!

Anyway,, I like the store, everything they have is fresh, their deli meat service is great.< /review>

I'm all about this place. Here are the reasons why:

-Vine Ripe is a family-owned business.
-Vine Ripe has super-friendly employees, from the cashiers up front to the deli workers in the back.
-Vine Ripe has obscure middle eastern specialties, ranging from fresh tahini to turkish seasonings.
-Vine Ripe has a ton of POG (Passion Orange Guava): best juice ever.
-Vine Ripe is CHEAP: think $.99/lb chicken drumsticks, $.40 avocados, $.99/lb serrano peppers.

If you want the charm of an international market with the produce prices of a farmer's market, this is your place! Also, they have hot prepared food which they sell by the pound in the back, which I would have tried had I not just eaten dinner. Definitely give this place a shot - just make sure that everything is at peak freshness! 5 stars well earned.< /review>

<Review>I have come here 3 times in the past year and a half. First time I got steak, it was moldy. Second time I also got steak, it was moldy again. I thought maybe it was just a fluke both times, so I have them another try yesterday. And the honey I bought was rotten as well! EVERYTHING here seems to be expired. Would highly recommend avoiding unless you want to be very sick<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Good prices, good food. Used to eat at restaurant all the time but then it changed hands. Today, I saw a new Grill. Will need to check it out. Mom thinks the greek olives here are the best.< /Review>

< Review>
A great Mediterranean market with a large variety of produce at reasonable prices. They carry loose organic products, bulk as well as packaged. It is sometimes harder to move through the aisles as they are rather narrow, plus sometimes the price is missing on fresh produce. Nonetheless, I'll continue to shop here on a regular basis.</Review>

<review>Love this place! So much selection, items you can't find anywhere else and treasures you never thought to try. I have found a few products from foreign places that I never knew existed and now can't live without!

4 stars because after 15+ visits here I began to notice that the produce, though well-priced, doesn't last as long as I would hope. Items start to decay quickly.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Watch out, they sell bad meat. I drove all the way from Lake Elsinore and bought lots of meat. But, the chicken legs were smelling bad, they left it for too long. Perhaps more than a week. They were wrapped with plastic so I could not feel in the store. Fresh chicken should not be kept fresh for more than a day, 2 or 3 days. They don't even keep them with ice. It was very bad. Very bad. i had to throw them. could not eat.< /review>

I enjoy shopping for fresh produce here, there are some wonderful deals to be had.  Most of the produce is ripe and ready to eat, so not a place where I would 'stock up' as your excess food will be over ripe or rotted before you can eat it all.  There are wonderful baked goods, meats, cheeses and other groceries to help you set an inviting Mediterranean table.  Usually clean, sometimes flies outside, but that can't really be helped.  Cashiers aren't that friendly but are efficient.<//Text>

This place is amazing!  They have a fantastic selection of teas, coffees and cookies, amongst other things.  It was here, at Vine Ripe Market, that I was given the opportunity to answer a question I had no idea I needed to ask:  Are Serbian Jaffa Cakes any good?  The answer is no.  However,  sparkling lemonade from Georgia (the country Georgia, not the state)?  A revelation!<//review>

The only super gourmet world import market choice for me is this store right here. It's got so much top notch goodies and I am impressed by fresh made choices at the bakery counter. So many brands of course so you have to come in and see for yourself. Also the best part is that it won't break the bank, this market is reasonable. Thanks VRM.</review>

<text>A good surprise little Jewel of a small neighborhood market.  Many foods you've never heard of with Cyrillic and Arabic lables.    A food adventure!  They will explain it to you if you ask. Exquisite meat market. Really good produce. All of it at reasonable prices.  The best part, it's on the opposite end of the lot from Costco! One-Stop shopping!!<//text>< pictures>

Middle Eastern/Jewish/Russian grocery store. The offer halal meats in their big meat department where they butcher on site. The deli offers many salads and hot options, and prepackaged meals to go. The bakery is excellent, offering many ethnic treats as well as traditional cakes. My favorite part of the store is they make fresh juice every day and cod brew coffee on tap.<//text>

Great place for produce and halal meat! It is attached to Mystic Grille a Mediterranean Cuisine Restaurant which is pretty good.

The market is constantly putting out small changes to update their diverse selection. They have just recently added some domestic and imported beers and have recently added items such as a juice machine with in-store fresh bottled juices and a live BBQ going on during weekends where you can taste and/or buy meats right off the grill.</Text>

<Review>Not everything I needed, but quite a selection of products I've never heard of and can't wait to try. Anyone I've ever asked about their products has been more than helpful ( rare ANYWHERE else I've been) and their butcher shop has great service and prices. 4 3/4 🌟 wasn't an option.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80d9571089292247:0x26eaf07e05112468</gmapID></record>

Be carful when you want to buy meat ( not All of them are HALAL), I have bought Ulker labnah and I checked the Exp date on top. it was 1/2018 (on tape) when I arrived at home after I opened it. I saw that there is another date (not well erased )in which is already expired 6/2017. So, sometimes they cheat !!< /review></record>

Selection of produce and middle eastern foods are plenty! Staff is helpful and friendly! Great olive and cheese selection. Stay away from the dried figs though. They are old tasting and not good. If given for free, decline.
Good selection of hookahs and tobacco but overpriced for sure.<//review>

This is a Middle Eastern market, which I did not realize. The selection is very different from other grocery stores and no beer or wine. I am sure that it is a nice place but it didn't have what I needed and I also felt like there is no outside indicator that this is a ME market. It looks like a Trader Joe's or Whole Food or other neighborhood market. I guess it was my mistake.<//review>

This is a Middle Eastern market, which I did not realize. The selection is very different from other grocery stores and no beer or wine. I am sure that it is a nice place but it didn't have what I needed and I also felt like there is no outside indicator that this is a ME market. It looks like a Trader Joe's or Whole Food or other neighborhood market. I guess it was my mistake.<//text>

Very horrible experience here. The staff double charged me. I went there twice trying to get my money back. But they would not deal with it and kept saying that they would contact me. They didn't even write down my transaction date. Apparently they would not return my money. Although it was not a large amount of money, it makes me very uncomfortable.<//review>

My favorite groceries store.  Excellent prices, fresh produce, friendly staff, plenty of parking space, multiple check out lanes, and very clean.  I think it's the best middle easter store in San Diego. They have an amazing selection of international products.<//Text>

Favorite specialty market, with a huge range of Middle Eastern and European products.  Great deli counter and hot, prepared food area.  One whole aisle of teas, many brands, lots of loose and whole leaf choices.  Produce could be fresher, but the selection of unusual vegetables at reasonable prices can't be beat.< /review>

<text>I absolutely love this market! They clearly buy from local farms, don't overtrim everything, offer a large organic selection, and have amazingly low prices. I often walk away with 3 bags of produce for $25. Their fresh deli and delicious bakery are extensive and the people are always helpful and friendly. It is my GOTO market.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>Very inexpensive produce, you just have to be a little more discriminating than usual when picking your fruits/veg. Great prices on most items, excluding fancy cheeses and some pantry items. Fresh squeezed juice mixes and you can make your own fresh oj. Premade food items are all very tasty and have good prices. There is a restaurant attached to the market that has delicious Mediterranean meats and saffron rice. There are some bulk bins too. Sale items change every week or two<//text><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

The produce didn't seem to be very good quality. Prices are pretty good, though. This is also not a good place for staple items as it is more of a specialty store.</Text>

The only complaint would be that some of the fruit and veggies are sometimes not very fresh and nearly rotten, but it seems they are getting better at this.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>The number one thing to remember is that this isn't Vons. Both are grocery stores, but the selection of goods vary wildly. Vine Ripe is my go to for Feta Cheese, Filo dough, pita bread. Fruit is cheaper elsewhere, but much more hit or miss than else where.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have tried my best to write down and compare the prices of the main goods (fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, cheese, Mediterranean products, canolies, and juices). Among the 17 biggest and most popular markets and groceries in San Diego, only 3 markets would really challenge the prices of the Vine Ripe (Its not Cosco, Walmart, nor sprouts).<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>5< /Rate><gmapID>0x80d9571089292247:0x26eaf07e05112468< /gmapID><Time>1529731712613</Time></record>

Nice people, fresh veggies and fresh grilled meat samples on the weekend. Some things are overpriced that you can get elsewhere cheaper and we saw ice cream that was dated 2016!?! We were there 10/30/2017.....so, check dates. Also, bought 2 cannoli as they looked good thru the glass and they were really bad, stale and old tasting.</review>

This is the best place to buy produce. Especially if you are juicing. They have organic and non organic options. I found this place by accident and fell in love. It's changed a bit since I first went in a few years ago but still is great. Can't beat the prices.<//text>

Warning !!!
Check the price and watch how much they overcharging and short change. I've cough them sevral times trying to overcharge us and many times we got short changed.  I dont believe they are honest. Bad ethics and morality. Be aware when shopping. Almost every time I go there the store is a mess and they are looking for a way to get you mad. I mean come on why you overcharging me and when I tell you to go check the price you lack responsibility to provide a good service. I'm never going there again. Most juices are from other stores but 1 dollar more. Also check for dates almost everything has changed dates on them. I don't think this is legal.</review>

Just don't buy too much produce because it seems to not stay fresh for very long.

always always after you shop from the VINE RIPE and whenever you got home you find yourself with expired food item.. so you should check the date before you buy from this GROCERY.
On Saturday July 11th 2015, after shopping and when i got home i wanted to taste some pickles i bought but the taste sucks, i looked for the date it was expire from STEPTEMBER 2014.

The quality of fresh fruits and vegetables in slowly increasing. However, prices are a little steep here for grocery basics. Always check the expiration date as well!!</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><username>Kyle Hotchkiss<//username><review>A dream come true! I was curious what Vine Ripe was since I moved nearby and finally got around to checking it out. I was delighted to find tons of middle eastern food! I can't honestly tell you what most of it was but it was a ton of fun looking around.

I have been craving Armenian water, called Jermuk, a product i've been told isn't available in the USA... but when I looked at the water shelf, and then saw Georgian writing... I found it! I found the magic Armenian water! I was feeling like a kid in disney world...

I ended up leaving with Turkish Delight (amazing) and cherry pastries... There were so many pastries i wanted to try but it will take me some time!!

I loved this store! Looking forward to going back.</review>< response>

< Review>
I recently started coming back here because my grocery bill from Trader's and Sprouts was astronomical. So now I buy my produce, chicken and beef here for about half. For a while the produce was really bad, but I think they have new management because it's much fresher.

We got some New York steaks here for dinner and I was expecting a mediocre cut, but it was actually really good and tender. Great for ground beef and lamb. They have real butchers too, if you're into that.

I still have to hit up TJs for some stuff, but this is my new go-to place for produce.< /Review>

It's a cool place to get  non-american stuff. Good staff and amazing nonalcoholic selection. Make sure that the fruits and veggies you get aren't spoiled. A few times I've picked up packaged lettuce and it was spoiled. But other than that, I like shopping here because it's economical for a student.<//review>

I go here mainly for the restaurant they have on site. They serve things like gyros and falafel. The salad topped with a fillet of salmon is almost always awesome.

The grocery store is different. You will definitely find things here you might not find at a place like Vons. Unfortunately, the produce can look a bit sketchy. Still, it's worth a look. They sell toasted buckwheat at a great price and their baba ganoush is mayonnaise free.< /review>

< Review>
Great selection of products from around the world. Lots of Middle Eastern staples and speclity items available.
They have an intesting /offbeat selection of eastern European and  Russian beer and wine.
Their produce is top notch at excellent prices.
Their meat department is even better. They sell great quality halal meat at prices that are Competitive with the big chains . ( Look for sales)  .
Try the kefta. If you've never had kefta it's a seasoned ground meat traditionally made from lamb. Today most of it is made with ground beef, with or without ground lamb. The kefta at Vine Ripe has lamb. It's the best around.

Making kefta is as easy as makeing hamburger s</Review>

(Translated by Google) For Russian and Russian-speaking people, a great store! Buckwheat, rye flour, herring, lard and other products from the Soviet table)) We really liked it! There are altars in Arab or Mexican stores, but for example, we found buckwheat only here.

(Original)
