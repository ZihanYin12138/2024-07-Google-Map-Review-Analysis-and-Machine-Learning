Staff was friendly and attentive. Drinks were on point. One night I had the ribs and they fell off the bone and into my mouth and it was like heaven. Another night I had the pasta special and another night the fish special. It was all good, and I am hard to please! Highly recommended.</text>

<text>We found this cool steakhouse while on our family vacation. It was a block away from our vacation rental and also a block from Silver Strand Beach. We had dinner here several nights, and everyone from the kids to the adults were pleased with their meals. The service was excellent as well.<//text><Time>1615436463898<//Time><Name>Everett Archambault</Name>< user_id>

Quincy 's is one of my favorites. The Picante Chicken breast dinner is my "go to". Mash potatoes are delicious. The bread and chimeric is so good...be careful or you will get full before your meal. Love this place!<//text>

< Review>
The finest prime rib, tri tip and ribs.  The ribs and prime rib are so exquisite you will never taste anything as good ever again.

I recommend everything on this menu.  If you can go out, there is truly nowhere else you want to go.

I also MUST mention that these people know how to cook meat.  They cook the prime rib and steaks and even tri tip to a point of rareness that is proper medium rare and yet somehow not bloody at all.

Yes, rare but not bloody at all.  That is perfection.</Review>

Quincy Street is AWESOME! The only reason I came in was because of the knucklehead who wrote the one star review! Thank you!

I met the owner Denny, who is a wonderful guy!

The food was great! The service outstanding, thanks Rhonda and I made a new friend, Denny.

We’ve definitely found our “Cheers”! Thanks Denny.< /Text>

Enjoyed a very good prime rib and excellent drinks with great friends. Service was perfect and the Hollywood stunt man turned restaurateur owner seems to be a personable and friendly guy. All in all a very enjoyable evening! I will be going back often I'm sure!<//Text>

Great local bar & restaurant! Service is outstanding. Drinks poured with a slightly heavy hand - which works for me! Not overwhelming, just feeling like you get your $$ worth. Love the tri tip and mac-n-cheese. Hubby gets pasta and clam chowder. Denny is almost always there and takes the time to get to know us personally. Just love the warmth! Infinitely better than typical big city annominity. Decor could be refreshed but the food and family feel supercede the aging finishes. Come to the strand and enjoy old-time family closeness, great food & drinks! Remember to say hi to Denny and his wife, Karen!< /Review>

<text>This a good place to go for drinks...a lot of their items on the menu are small, like tapas which makes their food kinda pricey IMO. Charming restaurant in the heart of downtown Santa Ana.

Best Ribs I have had Hands Down!
I went here two nights in a row when visiting friends in the area because the Ribs were that great!
Great small family restaurant where servers learn your name and servers are very friendly.
Loved this place and will be glad to recommend to family and friends.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Ate dinner here with party of 4.  Place was recommended.  Seated quickly and provided drinks and bread - fine so far.  Decor dated.  Wood paneling has not been used for at least four decades.  We all placed our orders and waited.  I didn't time this.  I was tired and dozed off for a good portion of this.  No refills on the water and bread by the way.  It was at least half an hour before food arrived.  I ordered first but for some reason the cook couldn't get 4 plates out together.  Waitress said plate was due in 2 minutes.  One of our party was done with his meal before I was served (over 2 minutes in other words).  This is something you just don't do ever.  I have been a cook in my younger years so I know better.  I don't believe the explanation that they had to recook my burger - and by the way this was a special of the evening and the waitress raved about how good everything was going to be - burger although cooked correctly was nothing special.  Clientele here was older, similar in age to the decor.  Will not be returning.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

One of my top spots for Seafood. Honestly my favorite evening place. I look forward to going back again. The bill was appropriate. Menu is like a place in San Francisco I liked.<//Review>

It's your 1970s, no frills, comfort food, neighborhood family restaurant. End of a long week? Don't want to cook? This is it! Great food and lots of it. Good service! Locals know it well.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Amazing service! The staff including the owner Jeff(I believe) makes you feel at home -- like you've known them forever! They are very attentive but not to a point where they are bothering you.

This was the first time I tried not your fathers root beer and I've been addicted since. I've only tried their drinks and appetizers -- I tried the hush puppies and the shrimp and gritcakes and both were very tasty.  One time we came they had a special -- fries with cheese and bacon on top and we couldn't stop eating that!

The food is tasty, I wouldn't say the best but love the vibe!</Text>< time>

I have been supporting local businesses like crazy during the pandemic and went her to get a specialty item for the holidays.

The doors were locked and they made me yell through the door.  Then a lady who said she was the manager wearing a lycra mask with an animal on it (which as you know this fabric protects you from nothing) came to the door and said I could not come in unless I have a different kind of mask than the one I was already wearing.  She said they do not allow anyone in their store wearing visors or other types of mask.  I informed her that stores can't just make up their own rules on what kind of masks they allow and have to follow the state guidelines and she said they didn't care.

I informed the lady that I have very severe asthma and that all masks meet the CDC criteria for businesses.  She told me that they have their own policy and would not allow me in.  I also informed her that I could show proof (even though it is illegal to require this by law) and that per the ADA it is illegal to discriminate with people who have disabilities.  She said she didn't care and i could not come in.

DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS.....terrible treatment, violation of all kinds of laws, discrimination....plan ahead and order online for half the price!!< /Review>

<Review>This store is amazing! Whether you’re shopping for a festival, burning man, lingerie, Halloween, or you’re just a REALLY fun person, you need to check this place out. They’re locally owned and operated so you can feel good about shopping here. And they are open through all this weird COVID craziness (bonus!). Thank you wicked chamber for now starting my new obsession with harnesses.</Review>< user>

The workers there were so sweet, I forgot to ask their names but one had neon red hair and the other had bright blue. They were so helpful finding sizes and zipping up when I couldn't.  The size range was also really diverse ,cant wait to go back!<//Text>

<Review>This place is the most magical land for all your costume and playful outfit needs! The employees are incredibly kind and helpful! They went above and beyond helping me with putting a costume I needed for an event. They are also doing an awesome job during the covid situation. They are taking temperatures and providing hand sanitizer to make sure everyone has a safe and healthy visit!</Review>< Pictures>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>I've been shopping at Wicked Chamber for years! They have the most amazing costume items I have ever seen. The price ranges are wide, so you can find one-of-a-kind, hand-made treasures, and you can also find all the basics any ensemble needs. This is an individually owned business, not a chain. That means they care about their customers. Buy local! Check it out, you will be entranced and delighted. ❤️<//Review>< Date>

The women there are so helpful and a lot of fun, not the slightest bit inhibited and each generally have a great sense of humor.  Terrific assortment of virtually anything you could desire and THEN
SOME. Sexy sensual erotic no matter your age there is something deliciously tempting for all.</review>

From raves to Halloween to the  bedroom there are options for all styles of people. I had so much fun here and this is now one of my favorite stores of all time.</review>

Oh my gosh what a blast!  A friend talked me into going To the wicked chamfer one day. The staff was so helpful hilarious and adventurous and letting us try things on. They were amazingly knowledgeable about all types of costumes sexual aids and just fun things to have in a relationship or alone. You can see in the pics I had a blast.< /Review>

<Text>Kathleen, is quite phenomenal in helping with any sort of need or want. She will even put you into things you wouldn’t think to try on, which ended up being what we purchased. We can’t thank her enough! Wicked Chamber will also be our Burning Man Headquarters when we are ready! Can’t wait to see what Kathleen puts us in next.< /Text><Name>Catherine black< /Name></record>

Don’t make the mistake of going anywhere else!

The staff waits on you hand and foot, they are attentive and are willing to grab anything and everything you need in order to assist you!

Wide selection and just like Bed Bath and Beyond, you will walk out with more than you came in for.<//Review>

< Review>
I came in tonight looking for some cute lingerie and and was blown away by how huge the store is and the selection! Literally like 4 different stores in one location! Awesome lingerie selection,  real corsets (can't find these anywhere else) toys, every kind of costume I could ever imagine, super cute rave costumes and steam punk too! Dying! I can't even describe this place! So much beauty and cuteness. The staff treated me like an old friend or family member and were very attentive. I bought a pair of shoes and a really amazing wig along with my new lingerie. I can't wait to go back for more!<//Review>

Came to Orange Cty with boyfriend for a work thing. The best place was Wicked Chamber. I went back 3 times. Place was fun. Had a costume for everything. Corsets galore and good range in quality.  Closed the place out twice.<//text>

<Review>So I was here about a month ago and I was helped out by a young lady named Misty talk about professional and well rounded. She not only help me find exactly what I needed but went above and beyond to make sure it fit me and that it was exactly what I wanted. Shout out to Misty and the crew at the wicked chamber I highly recommend this place all of their products are high-quality and last a very long time< /Review><time>1503962108324</time>< gmap_id>

I love the wicked chamber as I've been coming in since 2013 and the staff is always friendly and helpful. My go to gal however is Jamie because she is so incredibly knowledgeable and open about the products in the special room. She is so accepting and always such a doll to visit.
The products are always high quality and the selection is so vast I won't go to any other shop.< /Review>

<Review>Went here to buy a costume with my girl friend and all was good and well until we got to the register. The lady at the resister literally took one of the pieces of the costume out of the bag and tried to charge an extra $20 for a piece that clearly went with the costume as it was on the picture and in the bag with the other piece of the costume. She stated “this isn’t part of the costume” “this is extra” it was part of it, why the hell would it be in the picture and in the bag with the rest of the costume if it wasn’t.<//Review><date>1540513160227<//date>< username>

Needed some accessories for my EDC outfits so I came to wicked chamber and I found a pair of LED goggles and a pair of LED black leg wraps that light up green and I’m so in love with both of them. I can’t wait to wear both of them at EDC this year. Definitely check out wicked chamber it you need outfits/accessories for raves!!<//Review>

<text>Super Wicked costume and lingerie Store; they have almost everything and the place is huge!  I had never been and the owner, Bright, gave me a tour which was cool;  not to mention she was really nice and helpful.  A good selection of costumes for men too and they have a really cool spicy section downstairs.  I'm definitely making this my place to go for costumes and fun gifts for my special someone.<//text>< name>

Such an amazing office with a dr who is very passionate about her patients and her knowledge is endless! Always goes over and beyond! Upper Cervical care is a must for your overall health. This office is the only one I’ve found that does a detailed exam of the whole spine, locates the root cause of the problem and then uses 3D CBCT imaging to look at the spine. It’s amazing and I’m so thankful for this care! Whenever I’m not sleeping well or don’t feel my normal self I know it’s time to go get my spine checked.<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I really appreciate the level of care and respect this chiropractic office offers it's customers. After a bad first experience, they were very accommodating with the style in which I'm used to being treated in. Every time I feel I've fallen out of alignment (once every few months) I come back in and get an adjustment.
There isn't any practice like theirs in the area, and I highly recommend this for people who are interested in finding comfort in their posture and spinal cord again.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Mercedes is amazing hands down!!! I have been to traditional chiropractors for many years due to car accidents and I never got results like I did from upper cervical care. Her office has the most recent technology and her resting room is soooo comfortable. I would highly recommend checking this practice out!!!</text>

I would not be able to go through life, with any quality, if it wasn’t for the upper cervical adjustments I receive here!  They are truly a blessing!!

There really is no better care than upper cervical care. And if you don’t know what upper cervical care means you are missing out and need to try it! Upper cervical isn’t like the traditional chiropractic care. I struggle with headaches due to neck muscle strain and I will walk into Dr. Mercedes office with a headache and by the time I leave the headache will be gone. My ultimate favorite part of upper cervical care, aside from how AMAZING Dr. Mercedes is, is after you get your adjustment you go to a relaxation room for 15 minutes or so. You leave her office feeling rejuvenated 😌<//text>

<Text>Upper Cervical chiropractic has changed my life. I suffered numerous concussions and Dr Mercedes has been wonderful in helping me with my neck issues. Getting me back into alignment She is very kind does not rush the appointments answers all my questions,and Gloria her receptionist is very accommodating  when making appointments. The offices are very clean and they go the extra mile in making sure everything is sanitized after each patient. I would highly recommend this practice.</Text>< gmapID>

<Text>I am so pleased that I was introduced to Upper Cervical Chiropractic. Dr. Cook and Gloria have been incredibly welcoming and I feel like my health is truly a priority for them. They are unlike other chiropractors that I have visited where I often leave feeling worse than when I came in. The experience of a single adjustment is well thought out from beginning, where they assess me coming in each time, to end, with a semi-private room to let the adjustment set. I rave about my experience here whenever neck and back health comes up in a conversation.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><name>Harriet Hughes<//name>< gmapID>

Upper Cervical Chiropractic are healers. They aim to treat the cause not the symptoms. I can only try to express how sick I was. I had severe vertigo. I couldn’t drive and only left the house for Dr appts. They helped me get my life back. I am driving again and feel better than ever. I cannot believe how long I suffered until I found out about this treatment.. Alignment is an amazing thing. You will love Dr Mercedes. She is talented and very caring.</review>

Dr Mercedes is a fantastic chiropractic doctor! I have been to chiropractors for 30 years and Dr Mercedes is the best. While I am not against the traditional chiropractic adjustment, I do think the gentler upper cervical adjustment is better. And don’t think it is only for your neck! Her adjustment helps your neck and back. Sometimes the way my shoulders loosen up immediately after an adjustment blows me away! Same for my lower back which is usually pretty tight. My head is not sitting forward like it used to be because of Dr Mercedes! I highly recommend her!< /Review>

<review>Therapy has been very effective at mitigating my neck pain. It was time and money well spent and couldn't ask for better care. Also, the Doc is very in touch with current technology and research along with a strong commitment to patient wellness. Organized office and meditation space, great recovery process here!< /review>< pics>

I went to Upper Cervical Chiropractic at a desperate time in my life.  Although I was in my late 60s I was amazingly healthy, medication free and always active.  Then I was diagnosed with vertigo and spent over a month absolutely debilitated.  Basically bedridden except for medical office visits to an array of different specialists, a neurologist, audiologist, orthopedist, etc.  None were helpful.  I remember my first time at Upper Cervical sitting in the waiting room, I could barely hold my head up, I was miserable.  After their exam and diagnosis plus a well structured regimen of gentle yet effective treatments I am finally me again.  I have recommended them to friends and family repeatedly and cannot praise them enough.  I truly believed they saved my life!<//Text>

She explained how the experience is going be very different from the snap, crackle pop I was vary of. The adjustment was gentle  yet so effective.

Dr. Mercedes is incredibly talented and a gift to the community!  She works extremely hard to make her patients feel welcome.  She is also a wealth of knowledge when it comes to holistic lifestyle and reducing toxins in my environment.  I can't express how many ways she's supported my health!< /Text>

Upper Cervical Chiropractic has been a closely trusted part of my family's wellness. About 4 years ago, we had a consultation for my girlfriend and was able to understand the cause of her ongoing neck pain for 20 years. Under the care of Dr Mercedes and her predecessor, they were instrumental on allowing her to have a better quality of life. Since going to UCC, I will NOT trust another chiropractor with my girlfriends care!< /text>

Wow - Dr. Hanley is a wealth of knowledge and expertise. Her technology is truly impressive as is how she walks you through every step of your visit. This isn’t one of those intimidating “snap, crack, pop” type of places, thank goodness. The adjustments are gentle and the staff is so welcoming. Thank you!

Update: New ownership, but still killing it! Dr. Mercedes couldn't be more of a perfect fit at Upper Cervical. She has my every confidence and I'm so happy I didn't have to go searching for someone new.< /Review>

Dr. Mercedes is AWESOME!  My wife went Upper Cervical Chiropractor to find relief for extreme vertigo.  We tried a  traditional Chiropractor (bone crusher) and my wife was not happy.  I started joining my wife and for treatment about a year ago.  We both really enjoy Upper Cervical Chiropractor, Dr. Mercedes uses the Blair Technique, it's a less physical process for making adjustments and we have both made good progress.  We highly recommend Upper Cervical Chiropractor; Dr. Mercedes and Gloria and great.<//text>

Upon entering I felt very welcome by everyone. I've been struggling with back/neck pain and migraines for a couple of years now and after my consultation with Dr. Jessica, I feel confident that I’ll be able to be pain free in no time. After just a couple of adjustments, I already feel a big difference. The office is very clean and organized and I never felt uncomfortable even if the office was busy. I would recommend this place to everyone because they not only care to take away your pain but they empower you not to feel that this is something you’re going to be stuck with but that you’ll be able to heal and live a healthy life!<//text>

Update: they did give me a full refund. The front desk lady, Gloria, was generous and helpful.

Spent nearly 2 hours there, only to be told I was out of alignment and needed an adjustment (duh). $80 later, I was “adjusted” and in the EXACT same pain as before, if not worse. Waste of time, money, energy, and hope - and I still am not able to walk without severe pain. Oh! And they told me I need to come back every day in order to get better! A total ripoff. In fact, I’m going to call and let them know I want my money back. A terrible experience all around.< /text>

I've been coming to Dr. Jessica, for only one month and can tell a difference in not only my body (specifically my hips), but my disposition and happiness as well. I am able to return to my personal goal in precipitating in hot yoga classes and hiking, whereas before, this activity was limited and it appeared that my limitations were increasing. The office staff is incredibly accommodating, personable and efficient. I realize that I am still a "newbie," in this unique approach to chiropractic adjustments, but I am sold and positive about my future. Thank you Dr. Jessica and staff.</review>

<Text>For at least the last 12 years, I've had issues with my neck and back.  Sometimes the symptoms would get pretty scary.  I've had numbness in my hands and feet; I've had constant fatigue in my arms; I've had my feet fall asleep while running; I've even woken up in the middle of the night with absolutely no feeling in my arms or legs.  I've been to numerous doctors, and they've always told me the same thing: It's a nerve issue-there's nothing seriously wrong with you.

I lived with those symptoms for years.  It just became a part of my life.  Then I visited with Dr. Cecilia.

I told her my story.  She was not satisfied with my "just live with it" approach.  She wanted me to see her immediately.

On my first visit, Dr. Cecilia set me up for XRays.  At her office, she has this AWESOME 3-D X-ray machine.  I can't even explain it, you just have to go see it.

When Dr. Cecilia saw the results, she was a little horrified.  She saw the consequences of multiple sports/snowboarding related injuries, and told me my body had been slowly contorting to accommodate for a twisted spine.  She showed me exactly where my nerves were being pinched and could correspond those nerves to the symptoms I was experiencing.  She taught me more about my neck and back in 15 minutes than dozens of doctors had in my entire life.

Dr. Cecilia set me up with a plan.  The initial visit obviously involved an adjustment.  After ONE ADJUSTMENT, I started feeling better. ONE.  All that pressure on my brain stem; released.  I've been seeing her for about 3 weeks, and my adjustment has held.  I haven't felt this good since I was in high school.  No numbness, no tingling, no waking up in the middle of the night terrified I can't feel my arm, no fatigue in my arms and legs, no problems running.  I'm sleeping 8-9 hours a night uninterrupted, my digestion is better, I have more energy, I just feel better.

After 12 years of thinking I was going to live with these symptoms for the rest of my life, she's fixing me.  And if I can continue to get better the way I have the last few months, I will forever be in her debt.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dbff528cd3e017:0xd6f24262d2f80be6</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have grown up with back problems my entire life. Ever since I had a huge growth spurt at age thirteen, I've struggled to maintain good back health while playing sports and living my life. Upper cervical chiropractic treatment has made a major difference in my mobility and confidence with my athletics and daily activities. I feel great and I love being able to see my progress through X-ray assessments and check ins. Dr. Jessica and Dr. Cecilia are always warm and inviting and provide me with detailed answers  to my treatment questions and continually guide me to lead a healthy lifestyle that will benefit me for year to come.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><pics>None< /pics><rate>5< /rate><Review>If you are looking for a chiropractor in SD, look no further because Dr. Lee is simply superb! She cares about her patients and provides comprehensive information in order to ensure that her patients receive the best care possible. About eight months ago, I started experiencing shoulder pain and found out it was associated with a past head injury from many years ago. After seeing a traditional chiropractor for 6 months, I noticed my shoulder pain progressively got worse despite seeking consistent care three times a week. I continued to look for solutions through the means of acupuncture and even sought medical advice from two different doctors who both told me just to take ibuprofen (for the rest of my life). I wanted to find the root cause to my problems and didn't think the medication route was practical for someone in their early 20s.
I stumbled upon Upper Cervical Chiropractic SD on yelp and decided to schedule an appointment for a consultation. I was hesitant about seeing another chiropractor, but Dr. Lee ensured me that she would only treat me if she truly believed she could help me. We had a thorough talk about my symptoms and took multiple x-rays... And fast forward to almost one month of receiving non-invasive adjustments, I feel drastically better in both my physical and mental health. After experiencing body pain and tension for more than half a year, I believe I have found the best care that will help me feel (100%) like myself again! I highly recommend Upper Cervical Chiropractic SD for anyone who wants to feels better in all aspects of their health!</Review>< name>

<review>So much good stuff to say about Upper Cervical Chiropractic. Dr. Jessica and the great staff.   Dr. Jessica is so highly recommended and now we see why.   My husband have been suffering with Lower back pain and soreness for the past couple years now.  We bought a very expensive bed thinking this will address the issue, and yup!   Nothing. Decided to call make an appointment with Dr. Jessica at Upper Cervical Chiropractic  Wow! We are so happy we did. Dr. Jessica did a 3D Scan X-Ray on my husband. A week later we came back for the results. She was very knowledgeable on the procedure and techniques my husband needs to get his back, neck and health back. There’s no price to get your health back and prevent future injuries. We are so glad we did not listen to our friends telling us to have him go see a traditional Chiropractor. Also wanted to say Thank You to her staff Sandra for the referral.< /review><name>Haide C.< /name>< gmap_id>

Dr. Jessica Lee has helped me in so many ways with her amazing skills. I have seen many chiropractors in my life following a serious car accident in my teens, but upper cervical chiropractic is completely different. My treatment plan was specific, which I appreciated,  and has progressed even more quickly than I'd expected. I had constant pain in my neck and low back when I started 4 months ago and now I'm virtually pain free. I have complete range of motion in my neck and can work and sleep without even thinking about it!<//Review>

Dr Lee has been key to helping me and my neck issues from an old accident years ago. She really cares about people and their overall wellness. So many health problems stem from being out of alignment, and are completely treatable and also preventable. I have been to other chiropractors over the years and this method has proven to be the best, in  my opinion. Maximal cutting edge analysis and minimal manipulation makes it user friendly for anyone. Thank you again Dr Lee for helping me so much and improving my quality of life.<//Review>

I highly recommend Dr. Lee! When I first came to see her, I could barely move my neck. I had so much neck and back pain, I could not sleep. Dr. Lee helped me heal my neck and back and gave me the tools to strengthen my neck. I sit at a desk for 8+ hours a day and this past year I have been doing home renovation. After only a few visits I started to feel better. Now 6 months later, I feel amazing thanks to Dr. Lee!!! I can sleep a full night without waking up in pain. Have not felt this good in years </Text>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Lee for a couple of years now because the results speak for themselves.  I used to suffer from daily headaches and neck pain that accumulated over time from a prior car accident, snowboarding, and also countless hours hunched over studying during college.  I often found it difficult to focus at work and do my tasks.

I had chiropractic care before, but had never had upper cervical chiropractic.  I was amazed at how simple and gentle the technique is, plus how effective it is.  I'm happy to say that the headaches and neck pain I used to experience have reduced significantly. Instead of daily, I get them about 1 time every 1-2 months.

Dr. Lee is very friendly and upbeat with her patients. She is also very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what she does.  I'm so grateful to have found Dr. Lee and I still continue to see her monthly as part of my self-care routine.<//review>< user>

5.0 star rating 7/23/2018
If I could leave 10 stars here I would!   We were referred here from Sandra who works here and we could not be more happy to have come here.   Sandra and Alejandra are super nice and so helpful.   I have had back issues for maybe 10 years now and came in today to see AMAZING Dr. Jessica.   My lower back was having pains while sleeping, while bending over picking up things and at the most random times.   We came in 2 weeks ago and Dr. Jessica did her 3D xrays and scheduled me to come in 2 weeks after to examine my results.

As a business owner, I work with a lot of businesses and I was extremely impressed with how thorough they were here and explaining my situation in great detail and how upfront she was on everything.   I left here today,  so happy with my results and am SO grateful to have found Dr. Jessica and her team.  I plan on being a term customer and doing whatever she recommends to ensure I don't do something I shouldn't.

Before going to a chiropractor and getting the "SNAP CRACKLE POP" for some kind of quick fix, come here and get the 3D xrays.  You will be happy you did!

I am a very active adult, workout 5-6 times a week and live a healthy lifestyle and Dr. Jessica is a GEM and I am so thankful to have found you guys.

Thanks!!!!!

Derek & Aide.<//Text>

I've been under Dr. Lee's care for lower back and sciatica pain that made it difficult to walk, do household chores or even take a stroll on the beach with my husband.

The results have progressively lowered my pain levels. Last weekend I had a major breakthrough, I walked an entire 5K without having to stop and stretch to alleviate pain.  I made it the full distance without any pain! JOY to say the least.

This weekend I went one step further and attended a 3 day convention. Same thing, no pain.

Dr. Lee has made the little things in life enjoyable again.

Thank you Dr. Lee!<//text>

I also ride horses and used to play Polo. After having a few  unscheduled dismounts, the pain had increased. Dr. Lee was able to help my body get back on tract.

I would see her in a heart beat if I didn't move 1100 miles away.

<Review>Dr. Lee is incredible at what she does. I've had sciatic symptoms since I was 17 and she has been a major part in helping me manage my pain. I'm now to the point where I can play soccer again without feeling any symptoms. She is caring, professional, and very knowledgable. I'm also a strength trainer and I recommend that all my clients see her if they need any chiropractic work. I can't thank you enough Dr. Lee!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm done looking for a good chiropractor in San Diego - Dr. Lee is as good as it gets. I've been seeing Dr. Lee for over a year now since she was in her old office on Miramar. The drive was a little out of the way, but I couldn't find anyone better in San Diego. Now that she has moved into her new space (which she completed all on her own), I'm even happier. She is humble, caring, and very intelligent. If you care about your long-term health, I would definitely recommend that you visit Dr. Lee and listen to what she has to say. Thanks Dr. Lee!</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< review>
My name is Manny. I have been suffering from years of low back pain due to my occupation. I also suffered a whiplash injury from a car accident a few years ago where my vehicle was T-boned.  After the accident, I developed neck pain and my ribs on the left side would hurt. Medical doctors could not find what was wrong and their X-rays came back negative. I sought a chiropractor for my pain and had been going to him for 2 years, but I never got any lasting results, not even with massage therapy.

My discomfort was causing me a lot of stress and frustration. It would interfere with my work as I have to drive long distances on a weekly basis and lift heavy objects. My knees would start hurting after long periods of standing and in the last two years I started to notice that I was developing a weak grip in my right hand.  When I met Dr. Jessica, she asked about my digestion and I told her that I have had acid reflux for my whole life and I would have to take medication to relieve my symptoms. Often, I would be up in the middle of the night feeling the reflux, which prevented me from getting any rest. I did not realize at the time that chiropractic had anything to do with my digestion.

After a few gentle adjustments, I have noticed significant changes in how my body functions. My low back no longer bothers me, even when I drive long distance. My body feels better and more balanced, and the most surprising thing is that my acid reflux has cleared up! I no longer have to take medication to manage the reflux and I can sleep through the night. Even my family members have noticed that I no longer have to take pills.

I have more energy during the day, my thoughts are much clearer (no more brain fog), and my body feels much more balanced. I feel great!<//review>

Dr. Lee is awesome! I've had decades of chiropratic treatments due to some serious head injuries and never got any lasting relief, not to mention some were even adding to the damage I already had.  I was a bit apprehensive to try something new but I'm so glad that I did.  I've been seeing Dr. Lee for over 6 months and I now feel there is a hope that I can truly improve my spinal conditions and have a better quality of life free of constant pain.  She has been a wonderful inspiration.  She is so upbeat and positive, and very focused on how to best help me get better.  Not the usual cookie cutter impersonal approach that is so often experienced.

You will not be disappointed in the wonderful results you get with Upper Cervical Chiropractic.  Oh, and not to forget, Sandra, the front office assistant is another bright light and always so helpful in scheduling appointments and helping to find a time slot on the spur of the moment if I am having a problem.

I will be posting updates as my treatment continues.<//text>

I have been having the worst migraines over the last few years so much so that the would take me out for 2-3 days! Nothing was helping not medication, diet change, nothing.  I found Upper Cervical had a consultation and x-rays and was blown away by how bad my neck was.  I had taken a bad fall on an ATV many years ago and believe that this was what threw my C1 C2 out of alignment.  I started seeing Dr. Hanley about 2 months ago and the changes are amazing!  Not only is her bed side manor sharp, witty, friendly and on point but she is very knowledgeable and absolutely enjoys her job helping heal people.  Btw I have had one major migraines since Dr. Hanley has been helping me.  I cannot say enough of about her and her staff and the benefits she has had on my health.  Thank you!!!
UPDATE: Since Dr. Mercedes Cook has taken over the business she has kept up on the excellent care.  She kind compassionate, friendly, knowledgable and caring during these stressful times of COVID.  Due to the extreme stress in my life right now I have had to see her more than I was previously she has alway fit me in and re aligned me so I can function with a normal life. Not being stuck in bed for days at a time with migraines. I cant say enough about Dr. Merceds Cook.  Im so grateful for all your help, THANK YOU!</Review>

Back pain/problems run in my family.  EVERYONE on my fathers side have had the same back issues with herniated discs.  My whole life I have been afraid of following their same path (needing back surgery and being limited physically after the age of 40), so I have been diligent about diet/exercise/stretching the past 15 years.

Unfortunately, with all that work I still had back pain ~ albeit subtle.

It wasn't until I began working with Dr. Lee that the pain went away entirely.  We're actually able to get out ahead of potential future problems by ensuring that my body is in complete alignment to allow for natural healing.  Many unexpected benefits as well:  More energy during the day, I fall asleep much more quickly at night, and a "click" in my right knee that I've had my entire life is now gone.

Simply put, Dr. Lee is incredible.  I love how the intention of her work is to see her patients LESS by ensuring pristine Upper Cervical Health.< /text>

< Review>
Amazing !! I am so glad my sister told me about Upper Cervical Chiropractor...  I had been feeling dizzy ( what I and Doctors thought was vertigo )..I could not do my daily shores, could barely walk ( because everything would spin ) and was not able to drive. I had anxiety and was getting depressed ( from the prescription drugs, that were NOT helping me at all ) ....Until I was recommended to visit Upper Cervical Chiropractor... This was the best thing that could've happened to me. After viewing X-ray results Dr Jessica explained everything in detail to me and told me that she could help me :) With no medication :) ..after several adjustments I was feeling better... I regained my regular mobility and started driving within a month ( yeiiiii !! ) With the support from my family,friends,coworkers and the care from Dr Jessica I am still on the road to full recovery.. And of course "Thanks to God" that guided me to right place. Also thanks to Sandra that worked with me to get my appointments scheduled. You guys are awesome and I will definitely recommend you to my friends and family.< /Review>

I came in for a consultation and initial examination, and, to my surprise, she told me that I was in the early stages of spinal degradation. I started seeing her several times a week to get my C1 adjusted, and eventually tapered off to every other week toward the end as a result of holding my adjustments. What I liked most about Dr. Lee is that she makes an active effort to educate her patients on their health, and loves to answer patients' questions. There was always a great sense of transparency in her work, which is extremely important to me especially in the health care field. Not only have I seen great increases in my health as a result from her work, but I also am now equipped with all the knowledge to hold my adjustments and look out for my health.

My daughter starting seeing Dr. Lee about three months ago, and since then she has seen a major improvement in her health. She crashed on an ATV a few months prior and began to experience a range of symptoms such as headaches, back and neck pain, heart palpitations, dizziness, and numbness. We finally figured out that it might be something to do with the crash affecting her neck, and Dr. Lee agreed once she did exams and took x-rays. She began treating my daughter two or three times a week. The visits are short (about 15 minutes) which is convenient. Dr. Lee is usually quick and thoughtful, but a few times my daughter felt like her visits were rushed and not as thorough as they could have been. But overall it has been a good experience and my daughter is grateful to have her health back.<//Text>

Dr Bosler is amazing, it has been close to a month if coming here and I can already start feeling my back pain subsiding. He took his time to explain what was happening and how the process of recover will start and how long it would take. A great lobby and very welcoming staff highly recommended.</Review>

"I moved to San Diego from Sonoma County last August. In Santa Rosa I was being treated by and upper cervical chiropractor. I have had much success in that form of treatment. No more Migraine headaches, less anxiety, strength in wrists are just a few of the benefits I have received from such treatment. I was therefore very pleased to be able to find Jessica Lee. I appreciate her form of treatment. She is very thorough, gentle, and is careful to make sure her patients stay in alignment so as not to revert back to their health issues. I highly reccommend this form of treatment and Jessica Lee.﻿"<//text>

< Review>
I was experiencing a painful week right arm stemming from an impingement  of C4 or C5 in my neck.  I could barely lift the arm it was numb and extremely week.
Kaisers approach was to operate which I was opposed to.  So a friend of mine who is a Chiropractor recommended I look for an upper cervical spine chiropractor using the Blair Technique.
So on the internet is how I found Dr. Lee.  Skeptical at firs YES.  I had the X Rays done and went to one of her new patient classes then started treatment I was desperate for results.
Dr. Lee is very well spoken and explained her process to the finest detail which is great because this process is not like any Chiropractic I had had before, no Cracking or Popping just mellow light adjustments after a thorough evaluation on each visit.  So No Popping or Cracking, I thought how can this work (look up the Blair Technique and the science behind it).

There has even been plenty of visits where I did not need an adjustment because the previous one was holding, which is the end goal of chiropractic.

After about a month on  my individual plan which included visits and home excessive I started to have better control and strength in my Right arm.  Each month even more.  Now at about six months out (I think)  I am completely back to Rock climbing, Surfing, Playing basketball and all the other things I do no more neck pain or arm weakness.  I am still in the stage of my plan where I see Dr. Lee about once a week and am regularly holding adjustments for 2-3 weeks at a time sometimes more.  I am consistently trying things that I wasn't able to do 6 moths earlier that I had done before my neck started causing pain.

I have never been excited to see that I have a Dr. Appointment coming up until now,  when I know that I beet my body up over the weekend, Dr. Lee puts me straight again.

I highly Recommend researching Upper Cervical Spine Care and the technique that Dr. Lee practices, Go visit her and get back on the path to enjoying a health life.

I was totally skeptical and I let Dr. Lee know that but now I am a firm believer in upper cervical spine care.

If your starting to have pain or had it for a long time and traditional Chiropractic either scares you or docent work, it's Time to check out Upper Cervical Chiropractic and of course Dr. Lee.

I waited this long to post (which I never review anything) to make sure I could make an honest recommendation.

Thanks for reading and good luck and good research

Thank you Dr. Lee for putting me back together (today).

Dr Lee has improved the range of motion and discomfort considerably.   She uses a drop table to push and reposition your vertebrae over several visits.  I am very thankful I found this place and Dr Lee.   I would recommend to anyone who has upper cervical neck problems and cannot go to a regular twist and crank chiropractor. 4/5 stars, since it can get expensive to visit regularly since it's out of network.</Review>< userid>

I have an incurable & untreatable muscle disease called sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM).  Muscle deterioration is slower than the other forms of this disease.  I came to UCCSD & Dr. Hanley a couple of years ago because my dominant right arm was numb, tingling, & my right hand was losing strength.  My left was very weak & I'm right hand dominant.  I need my hands to do things.  Unrelated to s-IBM, I also suffered terrible digestive issues.  After a regimen of adjustments not only was my right arm & hand were back to normal, but my left showed a slight improvement & the digestive issues were gone.  I've spent DEC 2017 - JUL 2018 caregiving a family member & neglected my own health during this time.  Needless to say I was losing ground.  I returned to UCCSD in pretty bad shape.  Once again after a couple adjustments things are improving.  Pain, tingling, numbness in both arms/hands has improved.  The pain in my right leg which caused sleeping issues is gone & I'm getting a good night's sleep again.  Lastly, my digestive issues have improved significantly.  In my quest to help myself slow down the effects of s-IBM & age, I've learned to be open minded, think outside the box, & try things till you find what works for you.  UCCSD works for me.  I'm forever grateful to the UCCSD Team Dr. Jessica Lee has put together.< /text>

Dr. Hanley is an exceptional professional who always practices a 'patients first' practice.
I had a friend visiting from the East Coast earlier this year with chronic neck issues aggravated by her travel. Dr. Hanley was very kind to accommodate her on very short notice to offer her relief. Dr. Hanley is the only Dr. my friend has seen in the last few years who she felt truly LISTENED, didn't try to pump her full of drugs to just mask the pain and not treat or cure the source, and who didnt tell her that what she was experiening "was all in her head". This same friend is in the process of relocating to the west coast. She counts herself exceptionally fortunate, not to mention extraordinarily relieved, to know she will have Dr. Hanley as a part of her healthcare team here in California. Thank you Dr. Hanley!!<//review>

<text>I wish there was a sixth star to give Dr. Hanley. As a professional she took  a thorough assessment using advanced x-ray equipment and explained why a young athletic 22 year was feeling like an old man. My back was so bad at times stairs were impossible. With her expertise she quickly targeting my issue and started my treatment. Its been a few months of treatment but I quickly was able to feel the treatment in weeks. Dr. Hanley provides a very zen and relaxing environment in order to ensure you maximize your healing. Most importantly Dr.Hanley was very flexible in my payment plan and as a college student making it less stressful for my healing process.  If you are experiencing any pain that your traditional doctor may not try or be able to identify I highly recommend you see Dr. Hanley at Upper Cervical Chiropractic. P.S the zero gravity chairs are HEAVEN!!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>My neck was constantly aching. I always attributed the nuisance to stress. After working with Dr. Lee for just a short time she has been able to get rid of the pain and fix the problem - not treat the symptoms. Drugs are not the answer, Chiropractic is! Thanks Dr. Lee.< /review>< response>

Initial review - 1 star - Husband applied for life insurance June 28, 2021. Was denied with no reason. He requested at least half-dozen times via email and received one response that his application was closed!.

I called the end of July and was told by Taylor she would check and get back to me immediately. Nothing.

I called today, they have decided to not release the reason.

*** The initial review was taken seriously, which is rather refreshing these days.
I was contacted the next day, and the information was provided to my husband the day after. I appreciate that Taylor made this possible. ***< /Review>

<Review>Ethos is the way insurance should be.  It is convenient, immediate, and I don't have to go thru an intimidating 3rd party salesperson to put me on the spot.  It was simple, down to earth, clear coverage with no hidden catches.  I put my information in, answered a couple questions without invasion of my health care  history or sending me to a physician for blood work, paid my first months dues and was sent the policy with immediate coverage and I could sleep better at night knowing that my sister and nephew are going to be ok if something happens to me.  Love you Ethos.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Ethos Life makes buying insurance online fun
Ethos Life is easily the most customer friendly website I have encountered while searching and shopping for insurance and other financial products. Considerable time and effort was no doubt spent towards providing such an easy to use format. I suspect their competition has also taken notice.</text>

Website and promotions push that it's all done online and that they don't hound you on the phone. But thats not exactly the case,once they receive your application they they call you to schedule a time to call you -if that makes sense- then when the guy called on our "scheduled " time he was on the phone with me no more than 4 minutes before he said he'd have to call me back and hung up on me! Then proceeded to call me multiple times later in the day to get back to our phone call. Which I didn't have time for, hence the "appointment". On top of that the actual coverage and cost is way off from what they tell you online even though I'm 34,no diabetes, no high BP,non smoker etc. 🙄< /Text>

I started to apply and fill out the application but once I put that I have had panic attacks in the past, they continued to dig and dig and dig, so I stopped filling out the application.  Since then they have BOMBARDED me with emails, phone calls and texts to finish the application.  A little reminder here or there is fine, but several reminders everyday throughout the day is over board.  For that reason I dont recommend them and won't be finishing my application.< /Text>

Bait and switch.  I am healthy abd have gotten quotes from Northwester Mutual and USAA.  I hopped online because it says $50 for $500k and my quotes were closer to $67.  Ethos wants to charge me $198.17 for 20 year term for $500k!!  Don't waste your time.</review>

Ethos does not adequately disclose that you can only pay premiums monthly, there is no annual payment option.  And by charging you monthly they add a hidden fee so your total annual cost ends up being higher than the policy's stated annual premium (an added $100 for me).  How they are allowed to do that is beyond me.</text>

<name>Erica Swallow<//name><review>Hands-down recommended! After spending a couple weeks getting life insurance quotes from the traditional providers, I discovered Ethos, and wow, am I happy I did. Not only was the application interface simple, clean, and easy-to-understand, but on top of that, the process was a breeze. After answering about five minutes worth of questions, I submitted my application; a representative quickly responded and kept me updated on the underwriting timeline. After about a week of wait time (for underwriting), my application was approved, and at a lower rate than the already-great-quote. I am so grateful that there's a millennial-focused life insurance provider out there. We're young and just trying to cross our Ts and dot our Is; life insurance should be simple for young, healthy whipper-snappers like me! Definitely recommending Ethos to my friends... and anyone else who asks me about my life insurance!</review>< rating>

Great experience with the Ethos team. I found out about this company through penny hoarder. I was just checking out quotes online and I found their application process super easy and I was able to get a reasonable monthly cost for the policy I wanted. The whole entire process was painless. I highly recommend!</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>THIS is what modern day life insurance shopping experiences should be like. A heartfelt special thanks to John and Josh, and all the folks at Ethos for delivering an easy, simplified application process. It was great to speak with down to earth people, rather than having some pressure selling  salesperson. I'll certainly be sharing with friends about how streamlined the process was.

Most importantly John and Josh, thank you for helping me protect my family with this term life insurance policy. It is an important decision that you were part of, and I really appreciate everyone at Ethos.</Review>< pictures>

Simple, easy, fast... I purchased affordable life insurance within 10 minutes. Had my benefits and policy package at my door by the end of the week. Signed all my paperwork online, no phone calls needed. This is a beyond excellent way of revolutionizing and simplifying the insurance process. Thanks for paving the way to modern day insurance service.</Text>

I don't pretend to know a lot about life insurance. But when my husband died I decided I better protect my kids. My husband. Didn't have life ins and it was a painful reality.

Ethos was painless! Easy, helpful and I must say, quick! Also, INEXPENSIVE!   The agent, John, assisting me was terrific.  It was actually a bit complicated because through a misunderstanding, I had a policy canceled. And John worked very hard to get me reinstated without penalties etc. Obviously I can't leave a review on how a potential payout may work out, however, Ethos has my full confidence as well as my recommendation.

I was unimpressed though in their defense it sounds like I'm not the norm. They advertise instant coverage with no physical below a million in coverage. I got a quote for 300k coverage at 39 a month. They said they would get back to me. Understand I'm a 44 year old healthy firefighter. After about 4 weeks (instant my arse) they got back to me, spent nearly an hour grilling me about my health history. Then they took another week to tell me I was approved, but at nearly 60 a month. I said no thanks. I will find insurance elsewhere. False advertising as far as I'm concerned compounded with discriminatory behavior towards emergency responders. Highly unimpressive Ethos!!!!<//Text>

I was given an online quote by Ethos based on my answers to a few questions and my age.  I filled out the online application and received a follow-up email that asked me to clarify one question for them on my application.  I did and a few day later I received a phone call advising me I had been approved at the quote given.  I was skeptical at first but Ethos lived up to their claims!  I highly recommend you give them a try.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Those of you who have researched buying life insurance out of the workforce will marvel at the ease of the process through Ethos Life.  Recently, I have inquired through several different companies for policies ranging from $50,000 to $250,000.  Along with a ridiculous amount of emails and calls from said companies, needing information and trying to set up times to go see their doctors,  I just kept putting it off.. until I found Ethos Life online.  A simple online questionnaire and a 5 minute phone call was all it took to get a policy with a reasonable payment.   For those of you that are 60 and above, try getting that with another company.
I am happy and impressed and my wife is happy to have the security for when the inevitable comes calling.  Thank you, Ethos!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<user_name>我爱冰咖啡我爱冰咖啡</user_name><text>For the longest time, I've been avoiding in trying to get a Life Insurance because they are too expensive. I have never heard about Ethos until I've read one of the Personal Finance Blog and the Blogger recommended going with Ethos. Just out of curiosity, I decided to check it out online. I was surprised by the quote amount and how fast the agent responded back!
John from Ethos was able to get an even better awesome deal for me  and it's a good feeling knowing  if something happens to me (knock on wood), at least those I care about will be covered. They've made my Life Insurance shopping so much easier. I definitely recommend using Ethos!<//text>< pictures>

{'time': 1535130580187, 'text': "Hi Pamela -\n\nWe're sorry to hear that your experience with Ethos was anything short of fantastic. We hold ourselves to a very high bar and appreciate when customers like you provide feedback. Unfortunately, we are not able to insure everyone who applies. We understand your frustration with this. It's also what allows us to make the process fast and easy for those we can insure. That said, we're always working to get better and appreciate your feedback.\n\nRegarding pricing: we are committed to honest and transparent pricing. In fact, we pride ourselves on this and the majority of our customers get the same rate they apply at, which is in stark contrast to others in the industry.\n\nAnd finally, your information will never be shared with anyone and we have made investments to ensure that our security is best in class. If you have any more questions or concerns please feel free to contact our support team at 415-516-3538 or concierge@getethos.com.\n\nThanks,\nJustin"}</Resp>

They suck! Pull you in with low rates, (should have known better) require very personal information, then tell you they won't be able to insure you. If my identity is compromised by this company I'll be calling my attorney. Don't fall for it! Also note, they don't allow you to leave a comment without giving at least one star, otherwise would not have given one!!</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Wow! What can I say? First off, if you are a skeptic about life insurance, don’t be! I am a very skeptical person about everything in general. I had never heard of Ethos to be honest with you! But to know that their policies are being backed up and covered by Assurity, makes things a little less stressful, because at least I know they are a reputable A- (rated by AM’s best) company so if you google them up, they are quite a popular life insurance company. Getting covered with Ethos is fairly simple. As long as you are honest about what information you are giving to the agent, that is what matters most! They check your MIB (medical records) as well as your driving records, so make sure you answer everything on the application accurately and thoroughly! The underwriting process may take awhile due to the fact they are checking everything about you, but once you’re approved, that’s it! You are covered! Life insurance doesn’t have to be complicated to get. But just be honest and of course pay your monthly fee or annual fee and being covered is as simple as 1-2-3! I also love how they make you feel like family, not just because they take your money, but my agent Josh is willing to give me some free Ethos logo t-shirts! What other life insurance company does that right? That’s plain AWESOME! They are also very friendly and if you have a question, you can text or email them, and they get back right away. They have terms of 10, 20, or even 30 years - depending on what coverage you are looking for depending on your current situation and income. Also, once your term is over, you can choose to renew your policy again, but then of course the price would change because you already passed your term. So to make a long story short, why not give them a chance to let them be your life insurance carrier? Isn’t it time you do something good for yourself and protect your loved ones especially when you are no longer here on earth. Thank you again Ethos and to my agent Josh, thanks so much! God bless and take care! To a long life!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Cats only is fantastic. Our two ragdolls, Wilson and Madison, have gone there for the past 8 years. Recently, Wilson was diagnosed with kidney failure. Dr. Priest was amazing in providing his care. Unfortunately, he declined very quickly and we had to put him down yesterday. Dr. Priest and Mike were exceptional in their compassion and explaining what would happen. These guys are first rate.< /review>

Dr. Priest and her staff are wonderful.  They are very knowledgeable,  compassionate and fair. They are always willing to answer all my questions whether I am there or on the phone. They do not pressure you to do any services, but gives options on the care they believe your cat needs, but in the end the decision is yours. Very happy with the services they provide for my senior boy. Thank you!</text>

About 2 weeks ago, I drove nearly an hour in traffic all the way there and back because of the impressive reviews I read.

My best friend in the entire world has been battling some type of infection for a couple of years now and no one can seem to tell me what is happening because the tests they make me choose between are not producing results. So while my bank account is depleting, theirs is growing.

Which leads me to my reasoning for the 1 star review.

After explaining my cat's symptoms, I was presented with a choice between 3 tests. Um, what?

I am not a veterinarian nor am I a professional in diagnosing issues with animals. Why should I have to choose between 3 different tests hoping that I pick the right one? I'm basically having to gamble with my money and pets health? No thank you!

Of course, the doctor called me and told me the test I chose came back with no results. What a surprise...
I asked her why she could not have recommended 1 test to me that would have been the best to start with based off of the symptoms I explained. To which she replied "Well we had a cat before who..."
I don't care about what your cat went through. I care about my cat!

These tests are not cheap, the office visit is not cheap, and neither is medication.
When I go to the doctor and explain my symptoms, I'm presented with the best place to start and if that doesn't work then we go on to option #2 and etc. Why can't they do the same for pets?

Look at my poor baby! That photo is her current condition. This is everything that I explained to the doctor that was happening! It gets worse as the days go by.

On top of that, I gathered all of her vet records that I could get a hold of and they told ME to go through it and find what medications she had been previously prescribed so when they figure out what's wrong with her they will know what to give her.
That is not my job. That's what I'm paying you for!
I work a very busy schedule and the only free time I have is on weekends and most vets are not open on Sundays.

Very disappointed with the entire experience. I feel taken advantage of and unless they can make it right, I will not be returning.</Text>

<Name>Dr. Alicia Tsounis< /Name><review>I’ll never forget the kindness and care we received while bringing our beloved cat here. Dr. Priest was diligent with her examinations and recommendations for labs. She was very caring and called me multiple times. I knew she genuinely cared and her heart ached for our baby. Dr. Priest and her staff were extremely professional and accommodating. We had an emergency situation, and on top of this being in the middle of the covid19 situation, veterinary care has been strained with reduced hours and not being able to enter buildings at all. At Cats Only, they were able to get us in right away last minute and frequently came out to me while I was out waiting in the car to give me updates and recommendations, including the Dr. This will not be your experience at other establishments. Please bring your kitties here, they are in such good hands ❤️🐈❤️< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

I brought my cat I got from a shelter in a few months ago. Her poop smelled foul. The vet just tried to sell me on food they had in the lobby. They said it was just a food issue. I took her to another vet and found out she actually has Giardia (parasite). Not only was this a waste of time but my cat has been suffering for months. She is really sick now. I could have had this resolved way sooner. This place is a scam.< /review>

<review>My cat kept sneezing with a horrible runny nose.  He face looked gross and he was miserable.  Dr. Priest explained the possible causes and the tests we could run to try to determine the cause.  After running some tests, she was able to prescribe the appropriate medication and now my cat is back to normal and feeling great.

<text>This place is amazing and I will never trust another vet with my cats again. Wonderful staff that go above and beyond to make sure you understand and are comfortable with everything going on with your fur baby. I have brought a healthy and sick cat here and received high quality and specialized care for each pet. Dr. is extremely knowledgeable and definitely sees to it that her patients receive only the best care.</text>< user_id>

Quiet place; professional, courteous, and knowledgeable staff; great veterinarian. We have 3 cats with different health needs and this place has served us well and faithfully.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for a cats only vet. We now live in roseville but started using them when we lived in Auburn by lake of the pines. After trying the many mixed vets available in the area, lots of them good, we decided a long car trek to a cats only vet was the best mix of travel and vet stresses for our dear ones.< /Text>

Can't say enough about this place.  They were able to get me a same day appointment and there was no wait once I got there.  They were very friendly and great with my cat.  Simple solutions for her symptoms and extremely inexpensive.  I would recommend them to anyone with a cat.  Especially if you or your cat are anxious at doctors appointments!</text>

This place was recommended to me by friends, who had an excellent experience here, i took my sick cat in to have teeth removed and it is very evident that the people there understand how much people care about their pets and seem to care just as much. The doctor was very friendly and patient with the questiond, had regarding the procedure, and the entire experience was easy and professional.<//text>

The staff at Cats Only Veterinarian are highly attentive and provide well informed care. They treat each kitty as if they were thier own. Dr Priest takes the time to insure that pet parents understand any situation surrounding thier fur babies and all options that are available for treatment that is needed. It's worth the trip if your kitty is sick.<//Review>

I just moved to the Rocklin area and have a feral cat.  He’s a nice enough cat but hates going to the vet … To the point where many vets have given up treating him and/or require that he be sedated.  Kudos to Dr. Priest and the Cats Only team!  They made it happen and didn’t have to sedate the cat!  New patient registration was a breeze, the procedures were fully explained … Great experience.<//text>

We took our cat here by sufgestion from a relative. After taking our cat to many other places over the years, we finally found someone who seemed to care about the animal as well as our feelings which, as it turns out, are also important. Unfortunately, our rwlationship was short lived bacause we were dealing with end of life situations like cancer and neuro stuff. They were professional and caring and helped us through to the end.  We appreciate all they did.< /Text>

<review>I has such a wonderful experience here. When I first moved to Rocklin in 2013 my cat got a blockage and got very sick I had to take her to the Rocklin animal hospital b/c I didn't know about this vet, I will never take my kitties to another vet again after bringing my younger kitty here. The experience surpassed any other I have ever had. The vet makes you and your animal feel very safe and comfortable (a very big contrast to the other mentioned) by the middle of the appointment my cat who had never been to a vet before was playing with her and walking around the office trying to get her attention. She's thorough and you can tell he genuinely cares about the animal she works with and helping the the owners feel relaxed. I cannot express my gratitude enough, they are fair and do not try to pressure you into any procedures or extra expenses. Before taking my little guy here my little girl had chin acne, I called rocklin animal vet and they told me I needed to bring her in. I called the cats only vet after because I couldn't afford a bill and asked what/if I need to do anything to help and get it under control and I was told how to help at home and that if it becomes infected to then bring her in. To me personally, this speaks volumes, they didn't try to goat me in, they told me how to help my cat. I highly recommend them to any cat owner that wants quality care and service.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809b2216290a5395:0x8482308795d03860< /GmapID></record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Date>1621972738175</Date><username>K Lafave</username><review>Worst experience ever at a dental office. My son waited 2 hours for his scheduled appointment with no communication from staff. He had x-rays done and was told to go the front desk. He was given a paper referral and nothing was explained to him nor was he even seen by a dentist.
He came in due to pain effecting his ability to eat and he left the same way. Can't read the referral to know what it says. My insurance covers wisdom teeth removal but I can't get the office to submit the referral.  Complete waste of time and energy.
I guess I have to go through the process again at another office because I unfortunately have Western Dental Insurance from my employer.< /review>< Pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>ATTENTION! AVOID this place!!!!!!!! It’s  the worst dental appointment I have been to and it is a total fraud. I visited the office to do the cleaning and in the end they had me pay $574 listed in the photos (I have Aetna insurance). What’s more disappointed is the customer service and the promises they gave. It’s beyond disappointment to describe this experience. It’s a nightmare to go though it.

First, the appointment system. They originally scheduled me for a day they are closed. I visited the office and nobody is there so I scheduled another visit. I arrived on time and they had me waited for about 1.5 hr to get to do the x-Rays. The visit took me a total of nearly 4.5 hrs and the cleaning only takes 20 minutes.

Second, after my X-rays, the doctor said I had serious problem with my teeth and said I have to  do scaling and extra irrigation. He also told me he will give me some take home products to help me solve the problem. But I didn’t feel any pain in my teeth at all and i have always had healthy teeth. But I was scared because it’s from a doctor. They had me waited another 1hr before my cleaning after X-ray.

Third, the doctor showed up and asked me to fill out some paperwork’s that’s required right before my cleaning. So I thought it would be paperwork. They asked me to go to the front desk and the front desk showed me 4 pages (later I found out it’s invoice). I told the front desk of the insurance I have and I am sure scaling is covered and the front desk said NO. I also asked whether the products the doctor said is required or necessary and the front desk said it is NECESSARY to solve the problem. They NEVER showed me the products but I was hurry in time that day so I just signed the paperwork and I think the worst case scenarios is to return whatever products they gave me. They DIDNT mention the “final sale” policy at all. It did indicate on the paperwork but I didn’t see it until I went home. They only gave me the products when I was about to leave the office. Back home, I found out the products were actually electrical brush and some solutions related to that, which I DO NOT NEED at all and those has nothing to do with whatever problem they were taking about.

Fourth, the cleaning or scaling whatever they think it is ONLY took 15-20 minutes. My usual dental appointment did a much throughly cleaning for me.

Fifth, I was furious when I found out I paid $574 for this and I called my insurance to discuss this experience and the insurance company told me SCALING is included and the insurance will pay for that and asked me to ask western dental for a refund. I also filed multiple claims on western dental’s website regarding this experience. I received a call from the Berkeley office’s manager about two days after my first claim. And I discussed about reporting this fraud incident to the dental board and the potential to use a lawyer to solve this issue. The manager AGREED to refund me if I bring the products back (she also made sure I didn’t open or use the products). I returned the products right back to their office BUT they didn’t give me any invoice of my return. I followed up multiple times by calling the Berkeley office (also now the number they have transferred you to the general western dental, not the Berkeley office anymore. normally takes 1 hrs to get connected to berk office) and the Berkeley office ALWAYS tell me they have filed my return and their billing is going to take care of it.

I NEVER received any REFUND. So I called my bank and tell them all about this, the bank refund me $367. And this morning I just received a call from western dental telling me that I have a past due of that amount. I argued with the operator on the line and tell them it is your problem not mine for this balance and it is illegal to charge me for what I have done. I will continue to fight for my own RIGHTS as a patient.

It has been 48 days since my visit and this has not been solved. Avoid avoid avoid please do yourself a favor. Read the other reviews (I didn’t read. If I read I would avoid this place)</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJYb-mGe7jTmHH73t5fVb5oULHBrg-4UAIkzZS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU0xSQK0t7vL2SutrwXZKbsw2XGiue8zjj6b_5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<Review>I should've done my research before coming here. Worst service ever! Not only are they rude...they violate HIPPA left and right. Phone calls with other patients on speaker within hearing distance of the waiting room is one example. Does NOT MATTER IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE or not...they will still find a way to charge you the most. If they are having a bad day believe me you will know. The only professionalism you get is interacting with the dentist and the hygienists. Do not come here unless your ready to wait hours after your appointment time and are ready to pay out the wazoo for services.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I’ve came to western dental a few times. They do a good job as long as you have insurance and pay for your dental work! I’ve had cleaning, root canal, cavities done here which I was able to pay for through payment plan/insurance. I would recommend it to anyone looking for affordable dental work on your budget. Thanks to the staff they making waiting for your dental work easy/they go through the cost with you as well.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is the first time I have gone in for a cleaning and thought it would be the same procedure. However, I was wrong. While making it in time for my appointment, they sat me down in a chair and told me someone was going to see me. As I wait patiently, I can overhear the dental assistants talking about their lives. I soon realize an hour passes by without being seen. A lady next to me who has the same appointment asks the assistant what’s going on so the assistant checks and responds with “they will see you soon”. I am very disappointed in the service and will not come back for cleaning. Only braces.</Text>< gmap_id>

Where to begin? They only have one specialist who is always booked at least 1 month into the future. When a root canal is required they may not send in the authorization to your insurance. When you call them, main office doesn't answer. So they send you to their 24 hr customer service. 32 minutes later i finally speak with someone. Who offers to stay on the line until we get ahold of the main office. Upon failing a 2nd time they then attempt to get you to sell them to friends and family. Do not expect fast surgeries.  This business care nothing for people. The negative reviews are well deserved.<//review>

The back office is great!  The front office staff is discombobulated and their staff runs in a chaotic disarray manner. It took from Sept 2 to 1/25/21 just to get impressions for an implant when they received the approval in October. EVERY time I make an appointment to get a specific procedure I get there and it’s totally for something else. I’ve taken off of work to get to appointments to have me wait an hour just to tell me they’ve run out of time and I can’t be seen for thAt day. I live an hour and 15 minutes away. The worst part is getting there on time and having to wait between 1-2 hrs after your appointment time. I would never recommend them to anyone. The sad thing is the back office staff are amazing!< /Text>

<Text>BAD COSTUMER SERVICE. I arrived on time for first time pacient appointment they cancel it right there. Their reason they had schedule wrong type of app. and reschedule for right type  for a week later. A week later I arrive 5 minutes before app (I'd first app of the day) but a dental assistant made me wait outside her reason "I needed to wait until it was time for app." Once inside front desk staff was so unprofessional that I decided to walk away and find other dentist. I DONT RECOMMEND WESTERN DENTAL AT ALL!!!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

The most disappointing dental visit I've ever had. I will absolutely not be returning.

I came in for a cleaning as a new patient. I've always had some kind of scaling done as part of a dental cleaning: no one here even bothered to poke around with a scaling tool.  All I ended up having done was X-rays and a polishing, and being told to do a fluoride treatment at home.  No basic periodontal screening.  If this is somehow limited service because of COVID, no one explained that.

I've never had a dental visit for a cleaning interrupted mid way to send me back to the front desk to sign more forms just to confirm payment for routine visits.  Again, I literally just came in for a cleaning which is 100% covered by insurance.

While my insurance will cover this, ultimately I still feel like I need to go to an actual dentist to get some basic scaling done and I'll likely end up having to pay for that one.  Deeply unimpressed with this place.<//review>

<Text>I'm not an overly zealous reviewer. I'm not an out-spoken person, but this place is so bad that I thought it important to write this review. Avoid this place and every location called "Western Dental & Orthodontics" like the plague. It's not an accident that all their ratings are in the low 2's. These places are tort lawsuits waiting to happen if they haven't already. They over-diagnose and over-charge for incredibly bad service. Even if they are in your network. Even if you have no insurance. Even if you think you are in pain and need emergency service. Please, please do yourself and your family a favor and continue searching.<//Text>< username>

Whatever you do, don't come to this dentist. terrible experience.  Waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes to be seen for a ROUTINE SERVICE. another patient was waiting over 2 hours for a procedure..... this dental office is seriously mismanaged and should be avoided if possible.<//Review>

This place and the costumer service is a complete dirty mess. I walk in and the mail from weeks was there in te floor all dirty with footprints all over the place.  The front office ladies (azucena and coworker)  were talking bad words and laughing between them. They refused to treat a patient who was in pain and then they refuse to treat me even having a appointment, with the excuse  they computer sister was slow and they have to make a new appointment next month.
Definitely never coming again.< /Review>

If I could rate zero stars I would. This place is absolutely awful in every way. Untrustworthy dentist, rude staff. The place was empty and I waited hours. Everyone is sitting around moving slow while they used up my whole morning.

After they told me I had 4 cavities and it would be $2000 dollars I decided to walk out and go to my family dentist back in San Luis Obispo who I have been seeing for my whole life. They told me I do not have any cavities. Places like this just want to make money off of unsuspecting people who don’t know better or don’t have money to go elsewhere.

Bottom line is, go somewhere else and take care of your teeth. You only get one set!<//text>

If it wasn’t for the pandemic we are in I would not have attempted to use western dental. I scheduled an appointment in April for a deep clean and extraction. The soonest appointment was months out (understandable due to the crisis we are in) since the beginning out April o have called to verify my appointment meant three times. Today is my appointment 6/16 (I took time off from work for this) I called as soon as the dentist opened to verify my appointment again. The secretary that answered “manteka” politely stated I did not have an appointment at the Berkeley location. It had to be a mistake, “manteca” then explained that I had an appointment for April 11 which is the original day of my call and that I missed my appointment...? I asked her if the dentistry was open on that day and she quickly stated they were not. So I asked her to speak with a more senior employee that could find out why my appointment was showing up, she stated “there is no one here other than me to talk to, the only person above me is the doctor themself who does not take calls.... so I asked he to transfer me to her corporate office where o then spoke with a rep who once again confirmed my appointment at this location. He transferred me to a supervisor who also confirmed my appointment before the call was lost. I called this locations back and spoke to “mentoka” once again who stated “I don’t have an appointment for you, if corporate made an appointment for you then we don’t accept those appointments, and I have to call corporate and have them call her to confirm the appointment, I don’t have time to continue to talk to so I’m putting you on hold”. I was on hold for 20 mins before hanging up and calling back to hear her laughing and joking before answering the phone. That’s completely unacceptable, never go to this location even if it’s an emergency. I now see why it has such a low rating. I blame “mandanteka” there’s a host of other issues but her lack of action and sympathy is costing this company.<//Text>

<Text>If I could give them a NEGATIVE star I would. I booked my daughter's appointment a week in advanced and gave her the insurance information over the phone. Her appointment was @1:00pm come  2:30  and they still have not called us in. when we finally get called to the back at 3 o'clock, they tell us they can't treat her, she is 4 and needs to be put to sleep to treat her cavity. I told her over the phone that she was FOUR!   Rude staff, stupid doctors, unprofessional, don't care about peoples time, and they need to be shut down immediately.<//Text>< Pictures>

Stay away from this place.  It's not only an absolute rip off (they try to swindle and cheat you), but the people working both in the front and the back office are very unprofessional and do not at all care to give you basic customer service or to treat you like a decent human being. My husband and I have never had such a terrible dental office experience as at the Western Dental in Berkeley.  Let me elaborate:

1) The two women working on the front desk first of all kept us waiting for nearly 2.5 hours to do insurance inquiries.  The inquiry call itself for our account only took a total of 5 minutes, but they had us waiting there because they were taking turns getting lunch and that was more important than helping customers.  When one went to lunch the other said she needed the one that left, and vice versa, so we had to wait till both were in the office together.  It was absurd.

2) Once we finally got past the waiting room, in the back after the x-rays, the dentist misdiagnosed me saying that I have a cavity.  (I later got a second opinion and they found no cavity).  They also told me that my insurance won't cover the types of fillings they use.  Ha!  A ploy to make money and have me pay out of pocket because that is so much easier.  They also offered their finance plan.

3) For my husband, they offered gum cleanings and more fillings that were not covered again by our insurance.  They once again offered a finance plan.  When I asked for a cost breakdown over the phone, the lady in the back, the so called assistant, hung up the call on me.  There was no voice raising from my end, but she didn't like the inquiry.  It was so unexpected and absurd.  I wouldn't expect this from a dental clinic.

A VERY UNPROFESSIONAL PLACE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT TRUST.  This place should be shut down.</text>

My experiences here have overall been good minus the long waits. My wisdom teeth removal went smooth as butter, I had very little to no pain the next day and was good to eat solid food that day. Not as horrific as everyone made it out to be. I do think they might try and nickel and dime from time to time.. they got bills too..  but you just have to be upfront about what you need and/or able to afford and they work with you pretty well. And the staff is very nice.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>This is the most poorly run dental office I’ve ever been to. At my first appointment I waited in the waiting room for 1 hour, even though I had made an appointment ahead of time. Then I waited in the dental chair for 30 minutes until the hygienist finally saw me.

My second appointment I got there and they at least told me it would be an hour wait, so I rescheduled. The next time I was in for a general check up/cleaning, they took x-rays and found that I had a couple cavities. Since they only do silver fillings and I wanted the white ones, they told me to go find another dentist to get my cleaning and fillings.

I will not be coming back here.<//review>< pics>

I rarely write reviews but very much feel like I need to in this case.

To sum it up: Had a tooth that I viewed was cracked, it was a tad sensitive to pressure but there was no pain. I called my regular dentist and couldn't get a soon enough appointment, so I called this place. Thankfully they could accommodate me and take my health insurance.  So they do the x-ray everything to this point is going fine. But once the x-rays are over they tell me I have periodontal disease (gum disease) and need to start  treatment right away pointing to the sign on the wall advertising periodontal treatment. This came as a surprise considering I came in for a cracked tooth. Like any regular person trusting who I view as medical professionals I agree to treatment but want to know the cost and details (what does it entail, etc). They bring me a $1,500 bill saying my insurance doesn't cover it. Obviously this was a bill I couldn't afford and they did offer a payment plan (that I still couldn't afford).

But something in my gut was saying "This doesn't make sense or sound right" so I said I'd think about it. Then they present me with a form to initial saying that by not taking their recommendation for the periodontal treatment I am risking tooth and bone loss. That was scary to be frank. Then I said "Hey what about my tooth?" which again was the whole reason I came in. The dentist casually says "Oh you need a crown" and asks the dental assistant  to find out if insurance will cover it. They then present me with another bill also around the $1,500 for this crown. This also hit me wrong because I felt like they overlooked the very thing I mentioned, pointed out and came in to check. I left not choosing any of their treatment and felt like something was just not right.

I called my regular dentist again and asked them to pencil me in if someone cancels, I'll take any appointment. Thankfully someone did cancel which meant I got seen soon after by my regular dentist. After x-rays and a very through exam my dentist said that I do not have gum disease and I do not need a crown. It wasn't my actual tooth cracking/coming out but it was an old filling. So basically I need a filling repaired and a tooth next to it gets a filling as well.

While I can say the place seemed clean and the people were nice...the way they are practicing business here is shady. If a dentist here tells you something... get a second opinion. In retrospect it feels like they were just trying to get money out of me and I think they tried to scare me in order to do it. I truly hope they clean up their act.< /Review>

I really really liked the people that work here. I thought they were all very kind. They were running behind. They were shorthanded yesterday. They said it would be hour wait. But I get it things just happen that are outta your control. Heard this lady yelling cause she would have to wait. Over and over. I kinda just wanted to stuff something in her mouth myself. Allen was very forgiving to her. He was kind understanding and offers many options to her. I can't say that she did they same for him. All her yelling just put the place even more behind. She was in the waiting room. She was the only thing that made my visit uncomfortable. When I checked in and out it was with Marlet. She was very kind with a smile. She was back and forth checking people in and being an assistant in the back. Kuddos to her for doing two jobs that day. Then Lauren did my x-rays. She was all smiles. Super kind. I really liked her to. Then Allen also helped the dentist I noticed that he did two jobs too that day checking people in when Marlet was gone to lunch. And his assistant job. Kuddos to him too. And delt with the crazy lady that screamed and yelled at him. He stayed so calm. Never raised his voice once. Just empathised with her. Appologised... So on. I felt so bad for him. Then the dentist his name is Dr. Baysa was also super kind. Each person apologized for my wait along the way. They didnt have to.  But they did. I don't think I have even felt so comfortable at a dentist office ever. Employee were all great. I would highly recommend office.<//Review>

Huge scam.  They will tell you whatever you want to hear regarding your insurance just to get you into the office. Once I was there, suddenly my insurance wasn't able to cover my procedure, even though I called Western Dental twice to confirm that they would.</Review>

If zero stars was an option...thats what they deserve to be rated. This is the worst dental office you could possibly choose. Don't waste you time making an appointment with them. You will wind up waiting a minimum of an hour past your appointment time. The staff are rude; the dental work is lazy and poorly done. Visiting your local welfare office is a better experience that coming to western dental. Do your self a favor and find a better option instead of putting your self through the stress and disrespect of this shameful place.</Text>

Waited 45 minutes from my appointment time to be told they did not have enough staff to clean my teeth. They did, however, have plenty of time to recommend a $1000 out-of-pocket treatment. When I refused the treatment and asked if I could just schedule a cleaning, they told me that they couldn't clean my teeth without the entire recommend package. I felt held for ransom. Big waste of time, I won't be back.<//Review>

Worst hospital experience I have had.
Waited for whole three hours and got canceled at last moment.
Waste of experience, time, and all the disappointment and pain.
Never don’t ever try this hospital. There are plenty others in Oakland, SF and it will be definitely better choice.

Anyone who plans their lives shod not come to this place. Poor and pathetic decision made by me.
Disappointed and frustrated at myself for not believing the reviews and coming to this place for only putting convenience of distance.

Hope anyone who sees and reads this review does not make certain mistake.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>You tried to give me a bill saying my insurance wouldn't cover it. When in fact it did. I came in as a new patient, they ranned my insurance. Claim parts of the work wasn't covered. Told me the out of pocket cost ask do I want to proceed. I packed up and left. Calling my insurance and when they did answer I was informed I am covered and they shouldn't had tried to make me pay cash. They also knew if I dont have a cash recite it's no trace just in case I pay cash and my insurance cover it. Is someone pocketing the cash payments? Something seem shady. Although the front desk seem nice definitely felt a snake was in the waters. They just wasn't very helpful and not well trained. And misinformed me with untrue information.  Not a good look if you want someone's business.  I dont plan to go back and dont recommend this practice.

The staff are very nice except for the dentist. This is the second time I have seen her and both times she was rude, no bed side manner and she makes it obvious that she doesn’t like being there. I forgot her name but she looks like she is Indian. The last time I had seen her was last year and I always remembered how rude she was until this last appointment. I was praying that I wouldn’t see her today. But I gave  her the benefit of the doubt. Nope, she hasn’t changed still rude.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>my first time there was today and I would not recommend them. They said I was not assigned there but when they called my insurance again I was and there was a long  wait time. Also my insurance was only going to  cover 10 dollars and they were going to charge me $963 for 4 composite fillings and they would not do silver.  When I called insurance to find out prices for fillings they said I was covered for silver fillings. Dr said he does not do silver fillings.  I left and will go back to my regular dentist I've had for more 23 years. My regular dentist is very nice and likes his patients.<//text>< pictures>

Allen and Lilia are really nice staffs. They will not give you a hard time but serve with kindness and sweetness. Dr. Rumalla really helps me clean my teeth and somehow "rebuild my teeth". I definitely will com back for further more dental operations. Recommended!!!!</text>

After having another dentist with a much better reputation, tell me my teeth looked great except needing a crown, these people tried to tell me I had 10 cavities and that I needed to have them all filled! Absolutely shameful for someone with a medical degree to try and permanently damage someone’s teeth when they swore to try and protect them. This is a true CRIME. I wouldn’t trust them to treat my worst enemy.< /Text>

I have never reviewed a place before, but feel compelled to. This dentist, I don’t even know her name, looked at my mouth for 5 minutes, disregarded the infection in my face, and then continued to try to sell me something called Perio Protect for gum disease. She seemed visibly annoyed by any questions I had. Save your time and your money. Go to a dentist that may acknowledge you as a person and treat your condition... not her bank account and relationship with third party companies. Everyone else that works at this place was awesome! Unfortunately, not awesome enough to ever go back and deal with this dentist. I dont even know her name!  It’s not in any of my paperwork. 🤣< /review>

<Review>WORST DENTAL OFFICE EVER! This place is a total waste of time. They waste your time waiting even though you have an appointment and at the end they make you come back to get a simple filling done. At the end, they can't get the job done and when I wanted to file a complaint to someone in the office, they have attitude. Then I called the main Western Dental line and they made me wait on the line for exactly an hour before it got disconnected. Such a joke! Take your business somewhere else and save your teeth, health, nerve, and money.<//Review>< gmapID>

I called to have an appointment and when I got there, they didn't have any record (kind of understandable, if you are tolerant) and I scheduled other one 2 days after. When I got there, I had to wait for one and a half hours and it was not my turn yet (apparently for some reason, other people go ahead of you) so I decided to leave.

If you have the University insurance, do yourself a favor and find other place. Even though this place might look convenient due to its closeness, you will have a bad experience just like everyone of us.

Wow. I went here and was told I needed a root canal and gum surgery.  They were ready to start the work the same day.
Something just didn't feel right,  so I got up and left.
Just got a 2nd opinion. Apparently I dont need a root canal OR gum surgery.  This place should be shut down.<//Review>

<text>If I could, I'd give this place a 0-star review.
Worst dental office I've ever been. And I'm writing this review only because how bad this place is.

1. After xray done by the assistant, the dentist came in, with NO introduction or greetings, poked my gums around very hard and caused pain.

2. Dentist was trying to push me to get intermediate/deep clean (cost $400+ out of pocket)because of some stain/ tartar.
3. My instinct told me was probably wrong, as I have a relatively good dental hygiene. So I firmly requested  for a general cleaning, the dentist said "no, we can't give you regular cleaning on your case"

Of course i left, and got my teeth cleaned at another place, with no extra cost. I was confirmed that my stain only needed regular cleaning.

4. Also before I went to the current clinic, I requested my x Ray to be transferred from Western Dental, and was told I need to.pay $5 for a paper copy, and $20 for email copy. With the same suspicion they are trying to rip money, I called their general office grievance dept, was told that records should be provided to patients for FREE!

So everyone please reconsider if you want to go here. And every time they recommend something to you, know your rights, ask the price and get a second opinion!

And to Western Dental: If you don't want to risk closing down soon, please be honest to your patients and improve your customer service.< /text>< user>

The entire time she was trying to tell me what I came there to do and tried to convince me I didn't know what I was talking about. When I said what I came there for, she just said "well you've got a lot going on in your mouth, sir" in the most condescending tone. Like why are you talking to your patients like that? All that does is make them feel guilty and it harms their self esteem which you shouldn't be doing if you call yourself a doctor. DO NOT go here if you need extensive work on your teeth, it isn't worth it and they don't look for alternative options that try to save your teeth at all.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

LONG WAITING TIME!!!
People here are generally nice. Dentists are professional but can sometimes be rude and arrogant.
Even though you have an appointment, you have to wait for another hour before your turn. It’s really frustrating seeing everyone come after you going in first :(< /review>

Welp! I'm in the chair right now. I have 2 baby teeth I've had my whole adult life. Last dentist, less than a year ago, said the roots are strong and my strategy is to try to keep them for as long as possible. Dentist here just recommended they both be pulled and  then need to get implants, $3500 each. She also says I have cavities on other teeth. After reading the reviews here, I'm going to get a cleaning here...and find a new dentist. Or drive back to my old hometown and see my old dentist who is not shady...and never recommended pulling my baby teeth! Oh yeah she also referred me to a dental surgeon for my wisdom teeth, which I have never had any problem with...ever!</text>

The first appointment the doctor want to take off two tooths for no reason i refused ahe refuse the service lile it's a family owned clinic or i went there to do for me a favor so they change the appointment and the doctor wasting of custimers time also rude with customer i feelt very disappointed that day and upset

All i can say that the lady doctor was very rude and mean also cancelling on me two appointments and sending me email that i didn't show up. !!!!

Worst dental place ever. I am never coming back again. Arrived at 9:00am, wait for an hour until they verified my insurance. Wait for another half an hour before they did the x-ray. Wait for half an hour again before a doctor came, did a 2-minute oral exam then presented me a ~$2000 cleaning plan not covered by my insurance. The doctor was not friendly as well. After I refused to do the treatment and left around 11:30am, I had to come back and forth for totally 5 times to finally get the copy of my x-ray results, and still not a complete copy in the end. I gave up. The only one star I give is for the lady at the front desk who was nice.< /review>

<text>Spent 1.5 hours on what should have been 15 minutes in total, no respect for my time whatsoever. I overheard lots of other patients being told they need "deep cleaning", and after waiting for eternity, they told me I needed it too, and it would cost ~950$ after insurance. Feels very scam-like, where they seem to just tell everyone they need an expensive deep cleaning, and fleece them. Don't trust them, I'm not going back.<//text><gmapID>0x80857e9e78ab5d65:0x7a731e7ebbeb697f</gmapID><user_name>Aaditya Ramdas< /user_name>< Rate>

I just received a call from them to “confirm my appointment for tomorrow” they didn’t ask who I was, well me who the appointment was for, or give me any further details. When I said they must have the wrong number because I didn’t book an appointment they said “Thank you so much we will see you tomorrow and hung up”. I’m not even a patient and they were AWFUL. Hopefully whoever they were trying to call doesn’t go their appointment tomorrow, the place doesn’t deserve the business.<//Review>

<Text>Don't waste your time here if you need anything major done. Scheduled the 1st appt of the day but they only had 1 or 2 providers in so I waited 90 minutes for my dentist, it was an emergency so I didn't mind it as long as I could be seen. They took an xray and later I found out that that was the only thing my insurance covered.

Dentist was very short with me, tried to convince me I needed a $5,000 treatment because I could not live without one of my back teeth getting an implant right away.

Dentist starting moving onto the next patient before I could even get a question in. Didn't address my pain and infection beyond a cursory glance and an amoxicillin Rx because  I begged for it (got a 2nd opinion and it turns out I had a tooth and jaw infection).

I wanted this to work out since they do exams and cleanings for free with my insurance, but one shouldnt be made to feel ashamed just for asking questions about treatment.</Text><Date>1560298101691</Date><gmap_id>0x80857e9e78ab5d65:0x7a731e7ebbeb697f</gmap_id>< pics>

Worst dental office in history since 2004. My appointment was 11:30AM. Got there 11:15AM. I simply left at 1:30PM. They didn't bother to check with us. I told them I been waiting since 11:15, they basically we let them know. Hello I'm here for clean up not a heart surgery. Wasted my time, I got life too and don't have time to wait while you take your patient in and out.<//review>

<Review>This place is a scam and easily the worst dentist office I've ever visited. It exists solely to scam people into getting extraneous procedures so they can max out your insurance and take as much as you'll let them get away with out of pocket. They had me wait 2 hours to get an exam, took the blurriest xrays I've ever seen, and then when I eventually saw a dentist she took the most cursory glance at my teeth and then told me I'd need 13 fillings and a root canal and that they'd send over the insurance person shortly. 20 minutes later she comes over, tells me it'll be $4200, maxing out my annual insurance spending limit and costing me another $2400 out of pocket on top of that. Now, I brush twice a day and floss sometimes. I don't have any tooth pain or anything so there's no way on earth I need all that work. I told her I was gonna leave and not do any of that, taking her print out of the cost breakdown with me. When I got home I compared some of what I was being billed for against what my insurance said those procedures should cost and found that they were using different billing codes for some of the things (fillings, which my insurance says are $56 were billed as "enamel" which was billed at $186 each).
TLDR: THIS PLACE IS A SCAM. STAY AWAY</Review>< pics>

I had a horrible experience at this dentist office. I went in for a new patient exam because I had moved out of state, and was hoping for a teeth cleaning with the hygienist after. I have always had a good experience with dentists in the past and go every six months for check-ups with regular teeth cleanings, never had a cavity and one dentist told me to go eat a brownie. When this dentist greeted me, she did not introduce herself, and the first thing she said to me was, "have you ever had a deep cleaning?" I said I didn't think so and she proceeded to do the gum readings. She was very rough so I began to wince, and she told me to hold still and that I was making it worse by flinching. There were a few 4s in the back but no 5s. After this, she told me some of my gums were bleeding and I had bone loss and that I needed a deep cleaning. The assistant printed off the treatment option which totaled $1354. I was surprised, so I asked her why this was necessary and she just repeated what she said earlier about my gums bleeding. I told her the reason they were bleeding was because she had been poking them and that I'd never heard of this periodontal maintenance, and after this she became very defensive and said if I didn't accept her treatment plan to go back to my previous dentist.  She was very rude. When I got home, I looked up the reviews and realized this has happened to many people at this office and that they had been trying to scam me. Later I found the dentist's name was Dr Nerrumalla. Please protect yourself and find a sane dentist elsewhere.< /Text>

Terrible place, please don't waste your time. Had two appointments here, and took off work to make them. I arrived on time, but at check-in was told that I couldn't be seen at all -- not enough staff. No notice whatsoever, no simple heads-up. Zero courtesy for their patients.</Review>

<review>Wish I could give no stars - please read previous recent reviewers Becca Jones-Starr, Della Moran and others because my story is EXACTLY the same.

I also was told I had periodontal disease, among other things and was shown a $6000 bill while sitting in the dental chair. I knew I couldn't afford that, but when I was told the minimal amount of treatment needed was ONLY $900 it sounded like they were offering me a bargain. I also was told my insurance would not cover the cost of the type of cleaning I needed, but a Perio Tray I could use at home would at least "heal my gums". I ONLY CAME IN FOR A CLEANING AND ROUTINE CHECK because I had recently moved away from my old dentist! I felt totally railroaded.

They also asked if I had a Care Credit Card and had I not said that I already had one, they probably would have had me apply for one! It should be noted that Care Credit is a high interest card that can be useful if you qualify for a no-interest promotional period and can pay it off in 6 months or so. It is the type of credit arrangement that can get you into debt if you're not careful, but providers like Western Dental like it because they get their money upfront.

On top of that, the dentist came back in and asked me to give a review of her assistant WHILE I WAS STILL SITTING IN THE CHAIR! She asked me if I had a phone, got it out of my purse, took it out of my hand and showed me the review app. I clicked 3 stars because I thought I was rating the nice-ness of the assistant and the doctor then said no, no I needed to give 5 stars so her assistant could get a free lunch. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL IS THAT?! I was clear-headed enough to skip the review, but they got over $900 out of my HSA.

After I walked out of the office I came to my senses and walked back in to say I had changed my mind about the Perio Tray. Sorry, they said, the molds they took had already been sent off to a lab and they couldn't "pull the ticket". What??? How does a tray get sent off that fast??? After pushing the issue, the office manager said she would TRY to refund me half of the money, but it would have to be approved by the main office. Needless to say, since last June I have been trying to get some money back that was taken from my HSA to no avail because Western Dental must have great legal advisors who write up their scam policies.

At this point, I would just like the $425 refund they offered but never delivered on. I certainly will never set foot in there again and am warning others! YOU WILL NOT SAVE ANY MONEY by going to Western Dental nor will you feel like you are listened to and cared for.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

<Review>RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY!

I had been with a dentist I really liked for many years. I switched to Western Dental when I got on Medi-Cal insurance. BIG MISTAKE. They dirlled and filled some dark lines on two teeth that I later leanred had been there for years and didn't really need to be filled. They also sold my girlfriend a treatment costing nearly $1,000 even though two other dentists later said there was no need for it. Plus, they refused to refund any of her money even though she didnt get the treatment. She sued them in court and won! There are more details I could relate but they are just details. The upshot is that Western Dental appears to be a crooKed, unethical business that places their own selfish greed before the well being of their patients.</Review>< userid>

< Review>
Don't go here.  It took me a month to get an appointment.  When I showed up on time for my appointment, it took an hour to be seen (I had to sit in their waiting room listening to stupid infomercials on the TV).

The dentist was unfriendly, disrespectful, and unhelpful.  She tried to convince me I needed an expensive "deep cleaning" and made me feel as if I'd done something wrong, although I've very conscientious about my oral hygiene.

When I told the dentist I couldn't afford $1,200 out of pocket, she refused to give me any treatment options.  She told me it was, in essence, her way or the highway.  She refused to provide the basic cleaning service.  So I walked out, having received no useful care.  A terrible, unpleasant experience.< /Review>

< Review>
This place deserves no STAR!!! I came to this office with my two children for the first time because they have a regular pediatric dentist they see on a regular basis but we just moved. We got here for their appointment on time but we had to wait for at least an hour watching NONSENSE on their TV before my young children were called and I was not allowed to go with them. At their regular dentist, I always sit with them to make the process easy for them.
Then I was called in for the dentist to talk to me about my kids' teeth. So I went in, waited but no dentist. A lady came to me and I was explaining to me that one of my kids has cavity. Then I asked her if she was the dentist and she said "no." I told her that I really would rather have the dentist talk to me as per what is going on and what my options are. The lady went and came back to me telling me that the dentist said "she can only talk with me if I had questions". I was calm even though at this point I was angry. I saw a lady with a lab coat attending to my other kid and I assumed she was the dentist. I went close to my kid and hoping that she would at least acknowledge me as the mother. She walk right past me standing next to the door without saying a word to me. It felt like we went to the dentist office without seeing a dentist. I felt like I and my young children were discriminated by the dentist. Such a person should never hold a job that has to deal with people face-to-face.
My children were supposed to see an orthodontist on the same appointment but I cancelled it right away and I asked for the corporate office number, the dentist name ( Neerumalla) and I called the number given to me as soon as I got to my car and laid my complains. I got a survey message about two weeks later and I also laid my complains. Up till this minute, nobody from the corporate office ever got back to me to apologize or  explain Neerumalla's attitude towards my children or towards me...
Please and please, do not go to this dentist office because Neerumalla (who I learned is the office manager) will treat you and yours like filth!!! I was not going to give this office even one star but I will not be able to post it without it.. Do not go to this dentist office!!</Review>

<review>The worst dental place ever! They make appointments but when you get there the dentist is always out. I’ve took off work multiple times just to get there and not be able to get any work done. I’ve called customer service plenty of times but they don’t do anything at all! I’m always on time for my appointments and paid my braces off a year ahead of my scheduled payments and this is the customer service I get? Not to mention the rude combative staff who shows no sympathy for people time. I would I not even recommend this place to a person with no teeth! Please avoid.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>The doctors are great. The staff are fantastic. I have no complaints about the quality of the treatment I got.

However this place exemplifies everything wrong with the American Healthcare system. In the waiting room (which you will have to spend plenty of time in - more on that later) I never had one wait where there wasn't someone poor or elderly or both having an issue with their insurance provider and the bureaucratic nightmare it places everyone in.

About those wait times. What on earth is the point of this place even pretending to schedule appointments? If you schedule me for 1:30; and I'm not seeing a doctor until past 2:45, this is NOT an appointment. I've never had an appointment here that started when it was scheduled and I've had the unfortunate circumstance of having  5 'appointments' with them in the past two weeks. Every time I end up waiting for hours and hours.

Clearly the staff are over worked and overbooked. They do great work still in their facilities that seem laughably outdated.

Bottom line, if you can find somewhere else that's better do it. Even if it's an hour drive or more do it, because you'd probably still save time rather than going to this place. If you must come here though just don't schedule anything else on your calendar for the rest of the day. Seriously like block out the next 3-4 hours, you'll be waiting for a long time.<//Review><UserId.>117800504006962925903<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80857e9e78ab5d65:0x7a731e7ebbeb697f< /GmapID><username>Aziz Khiyami<//username><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>Unbelievable! HORRIBLE experience!! Staff is incompetent and extremely rude. Charged me for service I didn't receive and then told me I couldn't get refunded for 21 days! Martha and Claudia are ditzy, irresponsible, confused and have attitudes that belong in the streets. These girls act like they just graduated from Western Career College where somebody told them "you can do it", and they went out and did it, but forgot that customer service and basic knowledge of how to run an office efficiently is important.
My children and I had appointments at 11, sat until around 1 and then they tried to charge us for teeth cleaning, stating that it is a "treatment". ???? Since when has teeth cleaning been anything other than routine? DO NOT sign up for their "family plan". It's a joke. They give you X-Rays and tell you that you need a cleaning! Doesn't EVERYONE need x-rays and a cleaning???
Martha and Claudia will probably get whooped by someone a little more "hood" than me due to their attitudes, and Western Dental will probably and hopefully go out of business due to their terrible service. Wouldn't go to this location again if someone paid me to.</text><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Name>Jamesa Sturkey<//Name><time>1374606435983<//time>< gmap_id>

Very unpleasant first experience at Western Dental Berkeley CA. I know that customer service is one of the most important keys to having a good business. The receptionist was unprofessional and cold hearted. There was a issue with my appiontment that could have been resolved right away but instead the receptionist chose to send me away.  My mother was with me at this appiontment and explained that I had a tooth emergency and even after saying this the receptionist ignored her and went to the next person in line. I spoke to customer service quickly after this and they told me to go back inside the clinic because I was in the system. Customer service even called the dental clinic to fix the issue. After this bad experience I decided to make my appiontment somewhere else. My understanding is that if you work in a clinic patients needs should come first. If you don’t care about helping people why do you even work at a clinic? The young Latina women should find a different job she clearly doesn’t understand that you don’t brush people off when they are in need. I deal a lot with people in the healthcare community and her work ethic is unacceptable even as a receptionist. I believe firmly in treating people well because whatever you do bad or good will come back to you.<//text>

Terrible place and terrible service. They over book ppl , everyone waits more than 1 hr to be seen. And the staffs are not helpful at all. They donot even want to call the insurance company to get the information they need. They ask you to call your insurance. Expect to spend 2 hr there and get nothing done. If you have time to waste, go this place. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

The staff and dentits have always been very kind  and lovely but Westen Dental as an organization is  EXTREMELY disorganzed overall. Without a bit of exaggeration, I have been there over 15 times for various treatments the last year and most times it takes them between 45mins and 1 hour before calling me in (once I waited more than 2 hours!). I have never had the pleasure of waiting less than 30 minutes; once, they scheduled me through the phone and when I got to the clinic the dentist wasn't there (showing we cant trust the central scheduling system), usually when trying to reach the clinic through the phone I have to wait over 30 minutes, I have given up multiple timea..and once at the clinic they literally llost my tooth crown in the middle of the procedure! During my looooong, multiple visits for implant procedure, the specialist dentist rotated so much that I ended up with 4 different dentists having to work on this one job...sometimes the dentist would complain about the former dentist's work...Sorry but I do not recommend unless you have no other option.< /text>

When I cracked a tooth while on vacation, I went to Western Dental because it was the only place around that had an open appointment at short notice.

They listened carefully while I explained I was on vacation and couldn't come back for a second treatment, and then proceeded to write up a treatment plant that needed me to come back for another visit.  I got charged for this plan (full ceramic onlay).

In conversation with the dentist, she finally understood that I was leaving California in a couple days, so she changed my treatment plant (to a simple crown, which my home dentist said was really all I needed) and said I'd get a refund.

That was seventeen months ago.  I've call probably a dozen times and finally, fourteen months after my original visit, I was issued a refund check--for $142 less than they said.  The check didn't have any explanation of why I was being given only 2/3 of my promised refund.  It turned out the insurance only paid less than half of what Western Dental thought they would.

I asked for an itemized statement of this.  They said it'd be 30-40 business days to get a statement.  I pushed harder, and after escalating two levels and spending 50 minutes on the phone, they were suddenly able to send me an email "by the end of the week."

If they'd listened to me in the first place about my not being able to come back, if they'd issued the refund promptly, if they'd at least included some kind of explanation along with the surprisingly small check, I wouldn't be leaving a mean review now.  But the whole bureaucracy around Western Dental was so deplorable I wish I could give it zero stars.  Not a good experience.  Do not recommend.< /Text>

I read a few of the reviews and I have to say I didn't have any problems, it was NO ONE in the waiting room when I got there. And it only took about 15-20 mins. To get called for the xray and Shirley that did the xray, and the dentist where was nice. I had no problems. I went on a good day at a good time. However I'm truly sympathize with everyone that had a bad experience.</Review>

If I could give this place a no star, I would.
Horrible place. Doctors and staff don't introduce themselves to you. They don't tell you exactly what they are going to do either. But they want to charge you a ton of money. Please don't go there if you care about your well being and your wallet.< /Text>

DON'T GO TO THIS BRANCH THEY ARE NASTY, RUDE AND UNPERFESSIONAL.
YOU MAY END UP WITH SOME KIND OF MOUTH DISEASE, THE EQUIPMENT IS DUSTY AND DIRTY THE WORKERS TYPE ON THE COMPUTER AND DON'T CHANGE THERE GLOVES AND THEN WANT TO ENTER THE PATIENT MOUTH. WHEN YOU ASK TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER LOCATION THEY WANT TO CHARGE YOU $100. AS THE PARENT OF A MINOR I WOULD NEVER LET MY CHILD GO BY HERSELF WE WILL BE CHANGING ASAP, I JUST SENT A COMPLAINT TO THE DENTAL BOARD AGAINST THEM AND WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT COMPLAINT TO CLOSE BERKELEY DOWN!!!!</review>

<Review>AVOID THIS PLACE! Waited for 2 hours just to get a 10 minute X-ray. Made an appointment at 1:15pm, didn't get seen by a technician until 3pm. The technician and front desk said I'll have to wait another 30 mins to be examined by the doctor, which will take at least 2 hours. After that I'll then be presented with different treatment options - "Bc western corporate is run like corporate". Ridiculous!! Nobody's got time for that. This will be my first and last time at western dental. AVOID for your own good.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>I have been extremely patient with this dentist office. The have a specialist that comes in like every month or so and I have been having an abscess on my tooth for an entire year already. I showed up to numerous appointments and on the 10th try they told me that there doctor didnt have the skill to perform my root canal. In the meantime i was not offered any pain prescriptions or anything to help with the infection yet the made time on my 6 month visit to tell me  I no longer needed a root canal. I was happy and content even though i had get about 3 filling that needed separate appointments for the reason I dont know. That happiness was shattered today when I happened to walk in due to extreme pain (from the abscess) and just so happens it was that time of the month where the specialist was in and they had me waiting in the waiting room for 3hours straight. I walked out and I never intend to go there again. It was extremely convenient only due to its location by Campus. They made me feel worthless almost. Like my pain and suffering for the past year has been ignored they wouldnt even give me a referral to another location. Worst dentist office I have ever been in. Ever.

I will never go to Western Dental again and will certainly never recommend them.  They showed a complete lack of respect for my time, and the office staff is unprofessional.  I was asked to fill out the new patient package of forms even though I wasn't a new patient.  The explanation was "It's company policy."  After 30 minutes I was taken back for x-ray's even though I had a full set done 6 months before.  When I asked for an explanation I was told, "It's company policy."  I was shown back to an exam room where I waited another 30 minutes and when I finally tracked someone down to ask how much longer it would be I was told that I was third in line!  I was on time to my appointment but after one hour had only gotten x-rays which my insurance will probably not pay for since I had gotten them only 6 months before.<//Review>

<Text>Left 3.5 hours after arriving. Finally got to sit in the chair and get xrays. No teeth cleaning because Western Dental, which is the only dental service provider allowed to me by Medi-Cal, didn't allow me to obtain the version of cleaning covered by Medi-Cal. E.g., their Dr's are allowed to prescribe care that's not covered by Medi-Cal, and deny the only services that are covered by Medi-Cal. Even though I have paperwork stating this is the only office where my DeltaCare USA is accepted, when directly asked, Western Dental wouldn't offer me the services I have paid for with my insurance.</Text>< Pics>

The manager doctor is extremely disrespectful and asked you to do the most expensive treatment plan. About 25k. Yes, and don’t respond to any of your question. Never come here!</Text>

My experience was ok. They were nice to me. They did hurt my Mom and Dad's teeth. The fillings did. My Dad said the dentist chipped his tooth. They fixed it but, my Dad  said he didn't even need the filling anyway. Both parents teeth are sensitive. We went to VICTORVILLE,CA. . branch. My Mom got a referral to see a Dr. in Loma Linda. She called Loma Linda and they said it was sent to a  fax # that was wrong.  She got the correct #, called  Western Dental and they said they would re-fax. She never got a call back from either place. She has a bump on her bone. You would think they would follow up.We live 3 hours away from the office. was there all day.<//Text>

<UserId.>102344721779939341066< /UserId.><Text>ZERO STARS. Horrible experience.  First appointment was 5 hours for exam, xrays, and deep cleaning on 1 tooth.  I provided them with XRAYS but they insisted on taking their own.  They require an exam every 6 months which adds at least two hours to your appointment time.  Second appointment was 3.5 hours for a crown.  After 11 shots of novacaine I still was not 100% numb until the supervisor gave me the 12th shot (in the right place), then I was numb instantly.  This was pure torture.  The inexperienced dentist drilled down my tooth too much and I am in constant pain.  Probably will need a root canal, but no insurance money left.  What they don't tell you is ALL THEIR DENTISTS ARE INTERNS RIGHT OUT OF DENTAL SCHOOL.  Not only do they offer slow, crappy service, it may cost you thousands to fix the damage caused by interns.  They went over the cap on my insurance without telling me.  They were very clear on what I owed them, but not clear on total billed to my insurance company.    Been sending payments on a payment plan but they have not recorded my checks.  Calling the billing department is futile.  They put you on hold with no music, just silence.  After about 20 minutes the phone just hangs up.  Tried calling 7 times over 3 days.  Finally I pushed the button indicating I was an insurance company.  Then they answered after a few minutes.  If you say you are a patient they will never talk to you.< /Text>< gmapID>

WORST SERVICE EVER. DON'T EVER GO TO THIS PLACE!
I had some issue with them and when I called the office, they told me I need to go to the Berkeley office in person to close a contract. Then I went to the office and the front desk told me the contract is already closed. A women said she'll do an audit of my report and call me back next Monday, which of course she didn't do. I called to check in and was told the contract is still open and I NEED TO GO TO THE PLACE IN PERSON TO CLOSE IT. WTF. I am just totally confused by this place.<//Review>

I went to Western Dental at the Briggsmore Location In Modesto I was refered to a Oral Surgeons Office  Who Questiond why I was sent to them when they dont evet deal with my insurance the only option I have is to pull my tooth and I am to a point that I have lost so many to with this office and they say they cant do a partial or a bridge because my mouth is to small ! so what am I supposed to do not eat and I call Dentical and no one will take my insurance !!!</Review>

<Time>1393978006434</Time><text>it now seems like this office (and other WD) offices just ignore insurance and bill FULL BOAT and add on extra non itemized expensive crap to inflate the bill...I was sent to this office by Liberty and the office says the Dr is not Network, so I have to pay FULL....,BS...this WD site gets most of the customers through Liberty and they toss all kinds of BS against the wall hoping  you will be stupid enough to pay full price...Liberty is starting full investigation and will dis continue contract with these rip off shops...but after all the xrays it was decided I needed a crown D2750 with high noble metal max $195 with Liberty...I was billed $445 ...also D4212 gingivectomy is no charge according to the people at Liberty and yet I was billed $478.....then I am being billed for another $250  for crown upgrade which is not even on the schedule ( they can only upgrade an extra $250 on one tooth...lab fees or some other BS, but they are double billing me on this fee...wow...perio maintenace billed at $40...and that was what I expected....!!!...but irrigation costs me another $119 (its iodine for gods sake)...and then crown build up with pins $50...I can deal with that...running total $1382....at Liberty's rates it should be less than half of that...not to mention that they want to refer me to an oral surgeon for 3 extractions, (I was only told about two from the very nice dentist...although she could be my grand daughter age wise)...god only knows what that will cost....I am going in next day off and challenge...challenge failed...even Liberty called and failed to get these rip off artists to back off...I fault Liberty also....this Western Dental is bogus and Liberty should red flag them< /text>< user_id>

I've been coming here since last year ONLY because they're convenient and accept my insurance but trust me when I say they're the reason I hate coming to the dentists . They'll have you waiting in the waiting room for an hour , then in the chair for an hour just to have a 30 minute procedure . And that's the LEAST . My appoint currently today was at 10 am and it's 1 pm and the doctor still hasn't even attempted to walk into my room . It's ridiculous . And it's ALWAYS LIKE THIS .<//text>

Do not go here. The dentist, Neelam is extremely rude and is visibly annoyed when you ask questions. She told me are you okay with silver filling if not then she won’t do an exam. I ask her why is that and she rolls her eyes and repeats the same thing. It’s clear that she doesn’t want to help you and is unprofessional, rude, unkind, and dismissive. I hope no one has to be treated like this just to get a dental exam.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Horrible service. The people behind the counter are rude and immature. They only care about money and don't attend the patients. Terrible I do not recommend wester dental and less the one in BERKELEY they give you bad service. The receptionists always give you an attitude and take 2 hours to attend you horrible Western dental you only think about money before giving good service to your clients.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Anyone who knows how to change my office? I am going to Berkeley are not attentive, as if it were so cheap .... 😠😠 I have more than two years with the braces and when they almost have to remove them they tell me that they have to get 4 teeth ... xk so far? ?? yes dr. At first, Ke iva to start told me that if they were needed they would take them out at 6 months now they have been going for more than two years and until today they want to take them out! Besides, I have to pay 900dls for that, money I don't have! Oh I pay my rent or take out my teeth .... 😞 It's too much money, Kiero talk to a representative or someone who's in charge xk the ke are there are clowns and they don't help you !!! Little communication with the dentist! Also, since last year I saw different dra. and she hasn't done anything to me since October to date only once I changed the leagues! Already 4 months have not done anything to me !!!!!

My phone which I bought wasn't charging so went to T-Mobile to have them check out the problem. Phone was fine it was the charging cord that was the issue. They wanted to sell me a new heavier cord for $25.00.Told them thanks but no thanks. Went to the nearest Wal-Mart & got a new cord for just under $5.00. While the salesperson was very polite, professional , & courteous their phone accessories are way over priced.</text>

They didn’t have the new iPhone in stock so they ordered it online and shipped it to me. Which is totally fine. The problem is they didn’t upgrade my phone they just added a phone to my account. Which sounds like a simple fixed but it is not!  My account is totally screwed up now.  I’ll have to return my phone. Reactivate my old phone.  And then buy the iPhone again and now wait a month to receive it.

What the hell...</text>

Travis asked me to trust him and that he promised I'd be happy with his suggestions or I'd be free to go wherever I wanted. 4yrs later Travis still checks with me to make sure I'm happy with my plan, phone, etc. He also let's me know if there are any new phones or specials I may be interested in and I live in Oregon now. Travis and his team were very good to me when my times were hard and I'm very happy that I trusted him. Travis informed me recently about the Boom 2, however I had just purchased the new Flip 4. Then my boyfriend told me he'd be willing to try it, so Travis had it shipped directly to our place and we couldn't be happier.

<text>I thought they would help me all the way, but when they give me the wrong direction to send my phone, they no longer know who I am.  I'm still waiting for my phone to return to me, from the corporation because the manager gave me the wrong direction and she ALSO gave me the box to send my whole phone the the corporation to fix it.  What the corporation send me was just a plain phone with no charger, battery, or back cover!!!! When I went back and ask for help, they all no longer know who I am. As I finally got a hold of the corporation, they told me that the manager gave me false information and most likely all my stuff is lost.  When they say they'll help, a bunch of lairs!!!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1558735513952, 'text': "Sorry to hear your experience wasn't 5 star!

Came in about 6 months ago to trade in my old phone and get a new one (I was on the JUMP plan). T-Mobile guy tells me I qualified for $25 worth of free accessories and the only thing I would be responsible for paying is the tax on the accessories. I paid the tax on both, my new phone, and the accessories, right then and there so it wouldn't end up as an extra charge on my mother's phone bill. Later on, 6 months later, the other day my mom asked me to call T-Mobile because she felt like her bill was way too high. So when I called and asked what my mom was getting charged for, she named all these accessories that we were still getting charged for, even though we paid the taxes for these "free" items. This whole time we were getting charged for stuff we already paid for. I am writing this post to inform readers to check your T-Mobile bill, don't go into the store. Call the 1800 number and make sure you aren't getting charged for things you know you paid for completely. This company is shady af, and you could be over paying on your bill. The people at this store will tell you one thing and your bill will reflect another. Do yourself a favor and make sure you aren't getting ripped off!</Review>

The people at this location are ridiculous. The managers suck, if they don't know how to fix something they just brush you off, I had to go through 3 people one of them a manager and they did not help at all. Wanted to sell me an SD card for $50 I can get one for $10 elsewhere. Jose didn't know what he was doing, tried to sell me something then brushed me off, so I asked for someone else. The manager Jaime also didn't know how to transfer simple photos, tried to sell me something. Gabriel said he did transfer the photos then gave me the phone back and brushed me off. When I checked the phone too see if the photos where there, they weren't. But this guy just kept looking everywhere else, not making eye contact  saying he couldn't do anything. The other manager Kelly didn't even try to help and she knew what was going on acted like she was busy on the phone. They tagged me as an annoying customer because I needed to get pictures out of the phone before I turned it in under warranty and didn't want to loose them? Really? So then I leave, am able to transfer them to an SD card with the help of a friend, go back to get the new phone and the manager Jaime has the nerve to ask me How I Did It? And how my experience was? Are you kidding me? So when I tell him how I really felt he tried giving me some bullshit excuse. No man, you guys brushed me off because I didn't buy your expensive SD card and didn't take no for an answer to a simple solution and was totally ignored by the others. This store used to be good, everyone maybe except for Natalie, need to get some customer service and people skills. We've been with TMobile for about 15 years and recently it's just been getting worse and worse. Time to start looking elsewhere.</Review>

Half a day went by and my number never ported over. I contacted T-Mobile customer service and they looked into it. I was told a request was pending for a number to be ported over. The problem is that the number was not my number. The number was entered incorrectly. That mistake caused me to lose my number as well as contacts.

I went in the store last week to get my son a tablet and came out with just that! I also received a case for it which also had a stand attached! The staff was super friendly. I remember mate helping me nd guiding me to the right person. Travis was also very helpful in suggesting a protective plan so if its destroyed I can replace it. I've been with t mobile for a year now nd really enjoy coming to this location its always quick. I get in nd get out with EVERYTHING I need. :)< /review>

<text>Rip off store! Tell you all these kind of things that sounds good but isn't actually good and get  charges that you can't do nothing about it! Fast service but customer service sucks! This store is the reason why i'm leaving t mobile soon! The manager doesn't do nothing about it also when you talk to him, maybe because he's getting a fat comission off his employees< /text>< Pictures>

<name>Heb San<//name><Time>1478057374228< /Time><rating>1</rating><Review>Review for t-mobile store on shields and first in Fresno CA.  I have to give these people at least one star for answering the phone. I was trying to get  a new phone after the recall. Nathan answered the phone and stated they don't discuss their inventory over the phone. I was not asking how many of each phones they had in stock, I was asking if they had the V20 phone available. Nathan was an  ***** super rude...How low t-mobile's customer service has fallen? I say it is the lowest it has been during the 8 years i have been paying their cell service. Nathan even called me bro... I'm not your bro, bro.....you don't call your customers bro...Learn some customer service skills and be professional bro...<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>I have ben a customer for 8 years with Tmobile. Today my phone did some weird lock up thing, I went into the store for help.
The Customer Service reps that helped me looked up my account info, said I had a great plan, pushed the on/off button once, shook the phone and told me that because I have had it for 21 months its dead and there is nothing he could do but sell me  a new phone. The gal that was standing next to him suggested in addition to my monthly plan I purchase a pay as you go plan and phone in case something like this happens in the future.
I left the store, came home and googled how to reset an xeperia phone and was back up and running in 5 minutes.
That was unprofessional, he wanted nothing to do with me but to sell me a phone that's "only $250"
I will never visit this store again and their customer service people should be retrained on how to help a customer.<//text></record>

A female (cannot recall name but face is etched in memory)  rep said switching plans would save me $10 I ended up paying $60 more.

I had to pull the ron swanson "I know more than you" on the store manager which was fun.

The store in manchester center set everything right and took care of the return< /Text>

I changed my mind about that tmobile store after I got my next tmobile bill .yep my husband and I where ripped off by the two cons that waited on is after all .1.the phone was not the galaxcy brown and it was not new amd he added insurance on the phone to our account.Tmobile said they cannot insure a refurbashed phone and that is how we found out we were conned. IF YOU READ THE OTHER HAPPIER REVEIW I WROTE AT FIRST.YOU WILL SEE JUST HOW BADLY WE WERE CONNED. Dont go to that t-mobile. I HAVE MADE A REPORT TO RHE BBB.< /review>

We went today to ask why there is a coverage hole in North Fork and their proposal was to switch providers for a more expensive with less data plan. Yes, switch providers as in go to Verizon or AT&T.< /text>

Let me tell you it was such a different experience. We are well attended by everyone and they kept on coming and checking in on us. The food was delicious 😋 el Cafe de Olla was super delicious. Definitely we are coming back.< /review>< user_name>

< Review>
I was on vacation and needed a place that I could trust to cut a woman’s hair - I was so very happy and pleased to find AJ, an up and coming superstar with clippers! He was very thorough, gentle, professional, friendly- all that-AND a bag of chips! The whole shop has happy, friendly and very talented workers and the atmosphere made you feel very welcome and comfortable as soon as you walk in - if I lived here, this would be my only choice for getting my hair cut! This was the best cut I ever had! Thank you!<//Review>

Quick and organized. They're very gentle with your head, much skill.

25$ for a haircut, would rather have them charge a bit less so I can leave a bigger tip to the fellas that deserve it.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Just moved to the area. I went to these place 3 times and all 3 times I was rejected, after I just finished calling in advance cause I know that’s how they work. The last time I went I called 5 min before and I was told there taking walk in and there’s only one person I front. I said ok I’ll be there In less than 5. I get there,sign in all 3 of us (me and my little boys). I sit and out of no where one barber receives a phone call then tells me they can’t cut our hair cause there booked for the day. Keep in mind I have been there 3 times and never got a hair cut. I do t recommend these place to no one. There goes me supporting our local businesses.<//Review>< pics>

The Shop Cut and Shave is a great place. Get your haircut done by awesome staff. A haircut should come out to be around 25 but the service is premium so its worth it.<//Review>

< Review>
My first time going to this barbershop was pretty good the price wasn’t too high the second time I went I brought my son and they upsell the price on both haircuts $70 plus tip with this kind Economy right now with all this COVID-19 BS and not having that much work for myself it was kind of neck breaking paying that but oh well it was a fantastic haircut for the both of us but I can only afford for one of us to come back the barber told me that the owner is price gouging  that is not cool I might start looking somewhere else but I do recommend them if you have the cash.<//Review>

I did want to let you know that we charge $25 for walkins, we accept them all 7 days. The upsell your are talking about is most likely because you set an appointment in which we charge an extra $10 on top of your $25 haircut price. I’m sorry there was a misunderstanding that should have been told to you when you set the appointment. I would love for you and your son to keep experiencing our lovely barbershop. My name is Diego owner here at The Shop if you have any questions pls feel free to give me a call (909) 685-7870 . Also I would love to personally treat you and your son to a haircut on the house!

<text>Just walked in with the fam for my son's first real haircut and J took him in immediately even though other guys were waiting. Must have seen the stress in our eyes. But it was all good.

<Text>I called to make sure they where open today until 3pm like their website says and it is 1:30 and they said they would not be taking anymore clients for the day. Kinda contradicts their business hours🤷‍♀️ FYI we would have been 1st time costumers.<//Text>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1569399611607, 'text': 'Hello David,\n\nI recall this conversation. We did indeed have 8 people waiting and all chairs full at the time you called (around 1:30pm) Knowing the average duration of a cut, I understood that by the time we helped those waiting it would have exceeded 3pm (which it did). I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience but I would have really felt terrible if you came all the way down just for us to let you know this information. I hope you will give us the opportunity to correct this for you with $5 off of your first visit (ask for Diego). If not I wish you all the best.'}</Response>< gmapID>

<Date>1484539511499< /Date><rate>5<//rate><text>Claws is a great, cozy place to enjoy peel and eat Cajun Shrimp and Seafood.  We normally frequent Bucket Crabs and Crawfish and Nine Seafood in the area and this place compares favorably.  The flavors are spot on and the  service is quick and friendly.  We really liked the set menu items that include 3, 4, or 5 lbs of seafood of your choice along with appetizers which are also excellent.  The plaza includes 85 degrees and Gen so parking is a bit of a challenge on a busy day.  There is spillover parking on the sides so expect a walk if you can't find a spot close by.  We'll definitely be back.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxeogj4vOcdr9rBrpTckLeeh0hcH6Ls1Vb0oQB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWiGMLP3TIAXdoMYPAHa5cAPtClx0bUFSdKPu5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCILQh3urAXZz9luGVLM7LeaXPUvawLJN8ZCCJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzZk7B7dvPRP1htqe01OoP7Tw4SA8sRWlqe1qv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

forget Boiling Crab( BC)... Claws is by far the best crawfish place in Orange County!

1.  The staff are so nice and friendly.
2.  The food is so yummy, probably better than BC.  The shrimp basket is so fluffy and yummy not dry like BC.
3.  The crawfish seasoning is just as good as BC, and wait it comes with sausages and corn, and potatoes, and you don't have to pay for it..Another plus is they don't charge you .50 cents for water like BC.
4.  plus they have other things you can try there that is so so so good

*** quite honestly, I don't want to tell people about how good this place is because I don't want it to turn into another BC, but I want to let the world know what a hidden gem this place is, that's why I'm writing this review</Text>

<Review>Normally, there’s a short seating time.
The seafood is delicious & prepared in a reasonable amount of time.
The friendly staff makes the time go by fast.
Good location but be prepared, as the parking can be somewhat of a challenge.
Overall, the food IS delicious.< /Review></record>

< Review>
Clean restaurant, good food, friendly staff. The French fries are only okay but the rest of the food is delicious. I did not think that the "spicy" level of heat was that hot so I got the "Fire in the hole" on the side. There is a huge leap in spiciness between the two levels. There are a lot of businesses in the plaza so parking is somewhat scarce.<//Review>

Loved the fried catfish and garlic butter shrimp. My date was less impressed but is and has always been loyal to boiling crab. Customer service and wait time was A++. We will probably revisit and try something different...<//Review>

Was seated at a table the had a puddle of water under it and when advised the staff, their immediate response was, "oh you guys spilled water?" We just sat down, while we were waiting for them to clean up the puddle, they just finally brought us some water, so how was that possible?< /Review>< date>

Great place to eat cajun shrimp.  I suggest cannonball flavor. They have peeled shrimp as well, and the walls are free from graffiti Lol! Very clean place better than Boiling Crab!< /Review>

Food flavor was pretty good, price was decent. Environment was laid back. 2 asian women served us. One was attentive to us and the other couldnt care less about helping us. Will be back for sure. Just keep the snobby server away.</Review>

<Review>Boiling Crab's competition .. Same idea, bibs, paper covered tables, and shrimp in a plastic bag, only with half the wait time .. Absolutely nothing beats an original, unless your Oreos (Oreos are actually a knockoff cookie of an original.. watch Google it). Claws will hit that spot if your craving Boiling Crab. Service was great, seating was fast, and it was pretty packed. Food came out in 15 min or less, great place to eat!!</Review>< Pictures>

On this particular day we had ordered our usual which was the peeled shrimp in the bag, pound mussels, pound of king crab legs in the bag, side order of sweet potato fries and okra with water and beer. My wife finished her mussels and proceeded to open the bag of king crab legs, which she pulled the first crab leg out of the bag and noticed an unknown black substance on the food (see pictures attached).  Of course we asked the hostess who was near the door if she could send our waiter and showed her our concern.  I watched her go to the back near the bar area and speak to another waiter for at least 2-3 prior to her returning.  The hostess advised us that she was informed that it was normal, which my wife replied that she has never seen this before and requested that we speak with someone.  The hostess left and the "Lead Waitress" (never seen nor met her in the past) came to the table and we showed her the crab and told her our concern and request that this bag be replaced.  The Lead-Waitress then stoically replied that she can take the bag but will not replace it. I thought perhaps that she did not understand what exactly we were talking about so she just kept repeating her response until I realized that she knew exactly what we were saying.  We then requested to see the manager which she left and went to the back for about 5 minutes.  When she returned she said that the manager was indisposed. Now, I am thinking, who ever the manager is left this poor girl out to fend with the problem we have presented. I kindly told her, have your manager step out here please.  My wife starts walking to the back to speak with someone who maybe familiar with us and while she does so, the Lead-waitress gets on her ear-mic and says "an unauthorized person is about to walk in the kitchen", which I reply directly "No, she is not going to go in the kitchen" (wife stops and speaks with someone at the door).  While my wife is speaking in the back the conversation between myself and the Lead-Waitress starts becoming bizarre.  She then tells me that they have a right to refuse to serve us.  I asked, for what...because we asked for the manager.  She then says, we need you to leave (now I am thinking, she wants us to get up and go out the door and say we did not pay for our food). I told her no, that will not be happening.  She then says she will have to call security, which I agreed and told her the more witnesses the better.  In the meantime, my wife comes back and says that they told her that there was not manager there (so now we know the Lead-Waitress just lied to us). I call the emergency line and explained that it was not an emergency but we had a small dilemma at Crows Restaurant which dispatch sent one of their Sheriffs.  While waiting for the Sheriff the security guy comes in and we explain our concerns.   He is looking at the crab trying to figure out what is the black substance on it, then request to take pictures of it, which we agreed.  While he takes pictures, the sheriff comes in and we again explain to him what just transpired.  After he sees the crab he tells us that he will talk with the young lady (Lead Waitress) and see if they will do the right thing. After the sheriff speaks with her he advises us that she says that it is the restaurants policy not to replace food for any reason but that we did not have to pay for anything if we left.  Which we did.  We  usually recommend this restaurant to our friends and family but with what we saw on our food, and the way that it was handled by the Lead-Waitress, we will not be returning and recommend that anyone else take precautions by examine your food carefully (under the sauce) prior to eating.< /Review>< Name>

I've been to similar restaurants with the same concept such as the Boiling Crab, Hot n' Juicy, and Captain's Boil. We were a table of six and went around 530 pm. We were seated quickly and had our bibs tied and drinks served. We basically ordered a variety bag of seafood that consisted of unpeeled shrimp, green mussels, and clams. We added in corn and sausage. We also ordered the king crab legs which were pretty meaty. We had fried calamari, coconut sea snails, sweet potato fries, cajun chicken rolls (these were tasty) and we also had the breaded tilapia (which my aunt said was a bit on the salty side). Ate with people that weren't a fan of the spicy nature, so we opted for the garlic butter sauce.  For myself, I ordered a side of the cannon ball sauce (which is a mix of all their sauces - cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter). I highly recommend this sauce and you can adjust the amount of spiciness to your liking. All of our food came out quickly, the servers were friendly and attentive. Overall, it's a good place to go to. Harder to get a seat if you have a large party, so if possible, go in groups of 6, or go earlier for a bigger group. They don't take reservations (this could have changed) but, it's easier to get seated with smaller groups.  I would go back!</review><Date>1507234618219<//Date>< userid>

Come early this place usually has a wait! Don't bother with the premade meal deals that come with select appetizers, do the math... even chosing the more expensive appetizers there the deal isn't a deal is more expensive since lol:(

Other than that I'm content with the restaurant. Good food, great service, long waits but when you're there they take care of you. Just avoid the meal deals and make your own!

Also the pitchers of beer are a solid deal, you almost get 4 glasses for the price of 3.</Text>

First time there the service was terrible and then they want 18% tip that's already on a bill so the service was terrible because they already knowing the tip is already included no matter what I would never go there again<//Review>

Located in a great plaza that has plenty of places to come and eat at . During peak dining hours parking is a hit or miss . So if you prefer not to look for parking , then come during non peak dining hours .
Came to this restaurant and had ordered a few things . Clam chowder and baguette to start off, surprised that the chowder was great tasting. Wish the potatoes was cut a bit smaller , but that's only my suggestion. Ordered some Cajun wings and loaded garlic carne Asada fries , the fries is amazing and now I can't just eat any carne Asada fries .
Their version of the fries ,has made it my new go to spot . I can no longer order other carne Asada fries now , the shrimp and sausage was good as well .
Overall great variety of food and will be sure to come back . Love how they also have sinks outside the restroom , for those needing to just wash their hands .< /review>

<text>My favorite crawfish boil place. I first went to the original location in Garden Grove, then their larger location in the same strip mall, and now this one in Cerritos. Their meal deals are perfect for groups of 3+ and are genuinely good deals. My usual order: peel-and-eat shrimp in Cannonball medium with sausage. Side of garlic fries, calamari, and/or fried okra. Side of rice. Sauce is garlicy, lemony, spicy goodness. I recently learned their GG location burned down, which is what may have delayed this spot from opening. I'm happy they're open now and hope everything works out because I'll continue coming here!<//text>< pics>

Spacious interiors - large tall foyer makes for a grand feeling as you enter. To purchase tickets, head towards the tablets propped up on tables. Easy to print tickets, no hassles.

There’s a nice dining selection with lots of great local beers and wines. Craft brews and all the candy you could want during a movie. Bar area is modern and a great place to wait for friends or catch up with friends.

Seats are nice, it costs about $16 to watch a movie here. Reserved seating, which is nice.

Park in the lot on top of Trader Joe’s and walk over, or park next to the Bank of America, no specific theatre parking here.< /Text>

Usually come here at night, there's always extra seats, no need to sit elbow to elbow and the screen is gigantic, probably 3 + x's the size of a regular theatre screen. It's like watching a movie from a balcony. Great place for a date and then enjoy sunset strip.</Review>< pictures>

It's a pretty nice theater.  They are trying the upscale thing with beer and wine and somewhat fancier food but you can tell it's a rework of a more traditional theater.  The chairs are very normal (but comfy enough) however they don't match the $17.50 ticket price.

I personally was very unhappy that the place lacks any kind of nachos or movie cheese.  Is that kind of petty?  Yes, but for me it's a staple of the experience if they're going to offer pretzels and all that.  They try and get away with having a jalapeno stuffed pretzel but don't be fooled.

Anyway, the projectors are nice, it's not packed, and you can pick your seats.  All in all, not bad, but if they added the cheese id prob pop off on a five star.  The price thing is just Culver being Culver and the seat arm rests go up so it's cool.<//text>

this theater was an absolutely fabulous experience. There's a full-service cocktail bar, snacks and treats bar, the purchasing of the tickets for entire group was fast and easy.there are at least nine different theatres to choose from and picking different movies. The in theater experience was wonderful with stadium style seating so that everybody can see no matter where you are in the theater.the screens were super wide, and there was an attendant to announce the movie and protocol and procedure for in movie emergencies or needs.< /review>

Friendly staff, great decor. Not the cheapest theater in town but you do have the opportunity to get dinner and drinks ion the lobby, reserve your seats, and an overall older audience. The plaza was beautiful. Parking was a little bit of a hassle, but we ultimately got a good spot thanks to Google maps.</Text>

Nice bar and lobby. You can only order tickets at the computer kiosks so I recommend purchasing them online. The auditoriums are a little small compared to other arclight cinemas but I'm guessing that is due to their small footprint. People there are kind and accommodating. Certainly will come back!< /review>

<review>This isn't my favorite ArcLight location for the reason of confusion over location and lack of parking. The best place to park ended up being at a garage nearby that you could get validation for, but I had to drive around for a while to figure that out. Then the movie theater itself was hard to locate after parking. I'm glad I got there early. In other respects, it's a good movie theater, though.</review>< Rate>

Good theater. Frequently has interesting films that aren't playing other places. I appreciate that it's a little cheaper than the Landmark and now has reserved seating. It's much nicer since it's become an Arclight.<//Text>

This is a clean and somewhat attractive theater. It's located in a historic area and famous studios are just next door. The theaters are clean and the staff is very helpful. This is not a huge theater, but clean and the seats are comfortable.

The best asset this theater has is all the great businesses in walking distance. So, its easy to meet for coffee before the show and then grab a drink or a bite to eat after the show and talk about the movie.</Text>

< review>
after having lived in Texas most of my life it was nice to go to a large auditorium like those that are found in California when one goes to the movies. I was shocked that I went to a matinee to see Matt Damon in the movie The Martian and the ticket was more than $15. Concession prices at any movie theater are always very high but these were triple what I encountered in Texas and that is just ridiculous. I understand the cost of living in California is much higherthen most places but this was almost too much to imagine for a family of four or five wanting to go to the movie and get something to eat and drink before hand. The projection and sound quality were quite good and the seats were very comfortable but the movie was oversold and I had to fight to find a seat just for myself.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Arclight theaters are FANTASTIC! They are a step above most other theaters. If you want everything to be perfect for that movie you want to see go to the Arclight. An employee introduces each movie and stays for the first few minutes to make sure the picture and sound quality is perfect. No one is admitted into the Theatre the minute that the movie starts to prevent others from being interrupted during the movie. Three hours free parking in Culver City at the parking structures at Culver Blvd and Cardiff Bl across the street from the Arclight and the structure by Trader Joe's. Full bar in lobby too.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba29df23ccb3:0xdbe3df403ec205de<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Love to watch movies at this place, specially if you end up in the round theater. Very interesting that staff member will come to the front before the movie and announce a few things, as if it is a live theater. The gift shop has nice items but a bit pricey. I wish it was a bit bigger and carried more things.  There are also some shops and restaurants in the same complex.  The sushi place is really good.< /Text><rating>4< /rating>< Pictures>

Pretty straight forward. Went to see the latest Star Wars. Tickets were acquired through Fandango before going. There you can pre-purchase tickets and choose your seats. While the show and seating were great, I am a bit disappointed with the crazy pricing. We are a family of 4 and it was nearly $100 to see a 2.5hr movie! Just rediculous. It is not worth it to see any movie in big screen anymore for that price. 😞<//Text>

ArcLight Cinemas in Culer City are a solid choice for your movie going experience.  The place was remodeled a couple years ago and currently have comfy seating, fantastic sound and a upgraded menu at the snack bar.  The staff is nice and friendly and any movie theater I can get a beer while watching is a good choice in my book!<//Text>

This is my favorite theater. A movie guide introduces the movie and reminds guests to turn off phones and keep noise down. This is so much more effective than the on screen reminders. He or she also stays for about 10 mins in the theater. They say no late seating, but I think that's after the 10 minutes. There is regular Cafe food and cocktails are available. You can take into the theater. Seats are comfortable and big, but do not recline. Validated parking 3 hours in the lot over Trader Joe's. Overall a wonderful theater.< /text>

<text>It is a nice theater, but the place is a bit small.
They have nice and friendly staff here.  The bathroom is clean.
The price of the items is just as every theaters out there, pricey.  Their tickets are a bit expensive, but than it is Culver City.
I like the fact that they have a bar in there.  One can get a drink while waiting for their show.
They need to update their seating to be more comfortable for the price I am paying to watch a show here.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2ba29df23ccb3:0xdbe3df403ec205de<//gmap_id>< name>

I liked the ArcLight. I used to work at a different movie theater like 5 years ago and haven't went to a theater till yesterday. I watched IT and it was funny. Wished they had nachos but they let you bring in drinks from their bar which is cool!<//Review>

Wow! This is what a theater experience should be like! The place is clean, the staff friendly, the movie in focus with great sound, the chairs comfortable, and it offered reserved seating. The lobby is classy and the bathrooms emaculate. Previews before the film are limited to three or four, and we were not subjected to 45 minutes of cola commercials, movie trivia, local ads, and theater promotions that plague most theaters these days. All in all, a great theater experience!<//Text>

-3 Stars:
1. Overpriced
2. Uncomfortable seats
3. They will deny you if you are more than 10 minutes late

+2 Stars:
1. Clean
2. Downtown location

Bottom line: unless you are in walking distance and really want to walk, go elsewhere.< /review>

We've been away for a few years and they've really updated this place since then.  Very nice and clean, with good comfortable seats at reasonable prices.  I love love love that you don't have to sit through a half hour of advertisements before your movie.  We will definitely get there early next time and check out the bar that they've put in the lobby.</text>

<Review>We're huge fans of Arclight theaters and we love the Culver City location. It's pretty much the only theater we go to now. The theater's been all re-done and is really beautiful inside. Everything's kept spotless including the women's restrooms! Super nice staff and the little bar is cool- great cocktails and appetizers. Parking is super easy, and FREE with validation-- we park in the Trader Joe's lot.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba29df23ccb3:0xdbe3df403ec205de< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

New updated review for ArcLight:

Since ArcLight took over this location, they have really turned it around. The interior is much nicer and modern. Their bar seems like it can fit a good amount of people. The actual theater rooms have been upgraded with new seats. There's actually air conditioning this time! They have machines in which you can either buy or print out tickets, making the process much faster. Culver City now has it's own theater worthy of it's movie-loving residents.

---------------------------------
Older review:

This is an older theater that probably hasn't been renovated in a long time. I saw Thor 2 here so the theater was packed and that's when I learned they either don't have AC or it wasn't working that day which made for a really stuffy theater room filled with the stench of old snacks and body odor. I almost wanted to step out because of how uncomfortably stuffy it was.

I came back to watch Big Hero 6 at the final stretch of it's movie run so there was only 1 other group in the theater room and it was much more bearable.

Parking options include on the street, the parking garage at Trader Joe's which is 2 hours free or the garage in downtown Culver which is also free for 2 hours.

I wouldn't recommend this theater for a new movie showing.< /review>

The theater was nice overall and I wouldn't avoid it but it's definitely not the best theater experience I've had, although it had some issues. Parking was not ideal, but that's expected in downtown Culver city, still $12 is a bit steep for the base charge for valet. I was in theater 5, I don't know if the rest of the theaters have this same issue but the screen is too small, I had way too much of the people and room in my vision. Also, the emergency exit had this light that was breaking my immersion. I get that you need to know where it is but it seemed like it was brighter than it needed to be. I would probably give it 3.5 stars but that's not an option and I don't think 3 stars is fair.</Text>

Convenient and easy. Drinks are good and seats are comfortable. Frankly, the sound is really disappointing. Most home theaters are better these days, even some cars.<//Text>

Still my favourite place for movies. I admit it's Abit pricier. But the location, the seats, the ambience and the bar covers up for it.
Amazing place for a movie + dinner combo with your significant other.< /Text>

<Text>No customer service. Kiosks to buy tickets, no one told us before we bought a ticket that we couldn't bring in our coffee and leftovers, they told us to throw it away...to waste food or eat all really quick. Like they are running a dictatorship. I have never seen a place of business lose customers so quickly and a movie theater at that. They asked to search my little purse while I was standing in front of a sign that says no LARGE bags. Seeing that we took the bus to the theater and planned our whole morning around the movie this seemed like the most ridiculous rule I have ever experienced at a movie theater. When we returned our tickets and feeling disappointed in the theater, the staff behind the counter were laughing at us. All we were trying to do was see a movie after having our breakfast. Waste food...what world do they live in that this is a solution.<//Text><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2ba29df23ccb3:0xdbe3df403ec205de< /gmapID><Rating>1</Rating></record>

<review>I used to work here when it first opened as Pacific Theatres. The auditoriums are on the small side but it the screen sizes are more than enough.  ArcLight is the upscale version of Pacific.
Arclight focuses in quality control to assure their standards are being met.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2ba29df23ccb3:0xdbe3df403ec205de</gmapID><user_name>Marco Sanchez< /user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Whatever membership offer this theater chain has is pathetic.  They really have no ethics and none of their rewards have ever worked for me.  Not only that, they even denied honoring a gift card saying that it is not working because it has one less digit and their system does not recognize the card anymore.  I did not conjure up the gift card or get it from the underworld.  Their help center said go check with an associate at the theater, whereas the associate said call up the helpline.</text>< pics>

I would have given a higher rating, but the bar staff messed that up. The bar attendant treated us as if we were bothering him. You could see the frustration on his face each time we asked for something. This made me feel very uncomfortable and unwanted. Other than that the food was great, especially the hot dogs and wings. The other staff were nice as well.< /Text>

The great thing is that you can buy the tickets from the screens at the entrance, pick your seats, be sure to look where the screen is, you can accidentally sit yourself in the front row!
You can also get your tickets while you are getting your snacks. The only  thing I don't like; no Icee machine.
But the staff is nice, the theater clean, and its not too cold.</Review>

I love coming here! It's local and the staff is relatively nice. There is always a lot of space, even for opening weekend nights. Seats are not assigned so just arrive early if that's the case. There are a lof of places to eat around the theater, too! Great for a hot date with your boo!</review>

Not up to Arclight standard. This used to be an older (Pacific?) theater before Arclight took over, and it seems like they just need to run some quality checks, and swap out the older units.<//review>< user_name>

As with all ArcLight Cinemas there is a full bar (yes you can take your drink into the movie), early seat selection, and larger snack options.

There are large public parking lots around downtown Culver so parking is never really an issue. Remember that they will check your bag, not too thoroughly, but they do check.</Review>

<Text>Multiplex with the traditional concession stand with caramel popcorn!), also a full bar and some excellent small plates including popcorn chicken and margherita flatbread and more.
As of 05/2019, there is a lot of construction in the area so allow extra time to find the parking garage.</Text><userid>110414686952835736514</userid><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< name>

We had to hussle a block away in a small parking lot and wait for someone to leave. This rude "manager" called Kevin Chung told us to "leave the theatre" and that we were "not welcomed" in their theatre because we were insisting to be seated. We had no knowledge of this annoying policy. DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND GO TO AMC 15 IN THE HEART OF CENTURY CITY WHERE YOU ARE TREATED WITH FIRST CLASS SERVICE AND RESPECT AND TOP NOTCH FOOD. 10 minutes away from this dump.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

A nice, convenient theater, but quite pricey. I like that I can drink a beer here. I think their concessions has fewer options than nearby Landmark Theater. It's overall a good theater, but I deduct a point for value.< /Review>

Fantastic location; right in the mix of Culver City's core of restaurants. Great cocktails from its own bar which you can even take inside with you when seeing your movie! Take advantage of Culver City's public parking lots and walk over to this movie theater!< /review>

Once they finish the construction maze I think then it'll be nice & hopefully more adult targeted businesses are mixed in with some of the kid friendly places too.</text>< pics>

< Review>
The art deco building is that typical cinema architecture. Not my personal cup of tea but at least it doesn't clash with the nearby historical Culver City hotel. The interior offers a bar and a menu of eats to cater for the those that want to mix dinner and a movie. There's a set of touch computer screens if you prefer to pick up tickets at the cinema. The movie experience is good and I've never had a problem with noisy or disrespectful patrons. So this is a good place to catch a flic and grab a bite to eat.</Review>

I wish all movie theaters were like the Archlight.  First, the building itself was very clean and modern looking with an old school vibe. Staff was super friendly and tickets are fairly priced in comparison to other theaters.

Stadium seating, great food and beverage options, and comfortable atmosphere is what separates the Archlight from the rest.< /text>

<Time>1474298849303< /Time><name>J<//name><Text>The price has steadily gone up and the quality has not really changed. Become an Arclight theater instead of a Pacific gave it a nicer lobby, but the price went up a few dollars. The theater seats are still cheap and seats remain broken and/or ripped for months. The halls still smell like they did before the renovation.

It's convenient. Besides that, I recommend another theater.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The best popcorn, sounds, and video in town. If you see a few movies a year, an Arclight Membership is absolutely worth it.

Park in the Trader Joes parking lot. The others take forever to get out of.</review>

The place is fine but expensive. It is nice to have food options and the food I got was pretty good. Also l like the pick your seat option. It allows you to grab a drink before the show and not worry about getting a seat in the front row but you definitely pay for these things in the prices.</review>

The price has steadily gone up and the quality has not really changed. Become an Arclight theater instead of a Pacific gave it a nicer lobby, but the price went up a few dollars. The theater seats are still cheap and seats remain broken and/or ripped for months. The halls still smell like they did before the renovation.

It's convenient. Besides that, I recommend another theater.< /review>

Might have been in a smaller theater (#11),  but sitting near the center of the first row above the wheelchair row meant that I could kick my feet up on the railing. Highly recommend this row toward the middle.<//text>

I hadn't visited Culver City for a while and decided to go to the movies with visiting family.  Won't do that again.  They have no designating parking lot, and the parking available is too far from the theatre.  My relatives were elders so I had to leave them at the theatre to go find parking which I ended up parking on Venice Blvd and walked the few blocks back, not to mention my hip issue started flaring up, and I had to go get the car at the end of the movie as well in the dark.</Text>

<Text>It was better before it became Arclight. They raised the prices, made the lobby fancy, made the check in more difficult, but not a single improvement to the actual theaters.

Get your tickets and go because they have a movie for you to show! However, if you're on a budget you should know they're more expensive than what other theaters would show......🤓</Text>

I can never say anything bad about Arclight. It's my favorite movie theater chain by a landslide. The Culver location is one of their smaller and quieter locations. They have free parking (granted it is a little bit of a walk) and an excellent location. It is the spot my wife and I go to when we don't want to deal with the crowds at Hollywood. The only time I wouldn't come here is if I wanted to see a movie on a HUGE screen and/or IMAX. Over than that, flawless.< /Text>

Nice lobby, but the theater itself is just kind of a normal theater, normal seats. I thought arclights we're supposed to be extra fancy. But I've been to cheaper theaters with recliner seats and expected an arclights to at least have the same...<//Review>

Great theater except for their uncomfortable seats I couldn't believe  they serve  wine and beer and liquor. They also have an app that you can buy food before you reach the theater. The staff is very friendly and the place is slightly old school because they still ask you to turn off your self phones during a movie</Review>

I thought maybe I'd like a cocktail while I watch the movie......What for....???!! It was watered down so much .....For that much money it should've been better . Chucked full of ice with a splash of liquor......Over priced and not enough leg room in the back row...Guess we'll still go from time to time #meh< /text>

Polite and helpful staff, I was pleasantly surprised that they validate parking for up to 3 hours at the nearby parking garage using an automated scanner. No issues with sound or video.</text>

I've seen every incarnation of this location and i have to say that the arclight really took this place to the next level.  It's such a small thing but having a really cool bar to buy drinks and plates from really class up your movie going experience.</review>

Arclight cinemas is a premium cinema/theater company. Their seats are awesome and super comfy; their sound and picture quality is pretty dope. At the beginning of every film, they have an introduction by one of their staff checking "arclight standards" for their films. The costs of tickets these days are fairly pricey, yet reasonable for the perquisites, as mentioned.< /review>

They also have an app that you can buy food before you reach the theater.

<Text>Centrally located in Culver City. The Arclight is great because you get to pick your seat so that takes out all the stress of finding a seat and hoping to have a good view of the movie.

Thus location generally draws a good crowd.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ba29df23ccb3:0xdbe3df403ec205de<//gmap_id></record>

Went last weekend with my friend, have been here many, many times.  Lots of empty seats, easy to buy tickets on the kiosks, and the movie, "The Commuter" was REALLY good!  Don't believe the reviews...and I'm NOT a Leam Neeson (sp?) fan!</review>

<Text>Unfortunately they tore down my favorite theater to replace it with and overpriced overrated bar. 30 dollars for two tickets and just the tickets no popcorn nothing and everything is either small and overpriced or way too expensive to want to go there. Wish it was cheaper I shouldn't have to pay more to see a movie for the benifit that I can drink in public in fancy bar.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Reserved seating is great, buying tickets at the kiosk is great, the new bar and food options are great. I'm partial to this theater since it's walking distance, sometimes the choice of movies is lacking though.<//review>

Going to movies is expensive but if you're going to go, this is a good place. Clean, near lots of restaurants, and never any problems with the technical aspects of the movies.< /text>

Ridiculously overpriced and tragically unnecessary. I used to frequent the original theater at this location, but now I will never go again. I miss the good old days of attending the movies for nothing more than a film and the experience... I don't need assigned seating and insanely priced food and admissions to enjoy movie, which is probably why I (and more and more of America) opt to watch on the internet at home. Good luck, movie theater industry; you were killed by your own greed, not Netflix.<//Review>

Saw spectre and the staff was great. Theater is very clean. Audio is incredible. Video has an issue on the screen, possible screen pixel burn or something in theater #3 at midnight screening for spectre. During dark scenes it was a very noticeable purple vertical blur. Was looking for staff or management to let them know but I could not find them so I went back to finish the movie. Very disappointed in the video but overall experience was superb. Just hate to give bad reviews but it was a cold night drive and sucks when you're already there and can't really do much about it but suck it up. Fix it arclight for other guests.< /text>

They turn down the brightness on their digital projectors and the sound is horrible. Over $70.00 for a matinee with popcorn and soda  for 2 adults and one child with crappy dollar theater quality presentation is the reason this Culver City resident will not return. There were no refills either, not that you'd want them for stale popcorn and soda with about half the syrup it should have. I don't mind paying extra for quality, but I won't pay extra for a fake premium experience.< /text>

The theater has a policy that doesn't allow outside food into their cinemas...no problem with their policy, I just wish I knew about it before arriving at ticket validation. The attendant told me to through away the remaining half of a sandwich, take it to my car, or sit outside and eat it. These were their best option even though I also had $40 in items purchased from their concession stand. I sat outside and ate the sandwich BUT THEN about an hour in the movie, THE WHOLE THEATER LOST ELECTRICITY. The entire building had to be evacuated. Shall I say, "self evacuated" because there were no announcements, assisting attendants, or emergency response teams. I guess ArcLight cares more about training staff on how to reject patrons who bring in outside leftovers than addressing real operational issues. This was a horrible movie-going experience and I didnt even get a chance to see the end of the film.< /Text>

Always had great experiences at the Arclight theaters in Sherman Oaks and Hollywood. Family had a terrible time at this new one in Culver City. It started when a rando came and sat next to them in an empty theater and was looking at his phone and taking selfies. When they moved toward the back of the theater there was a guy smoking back there. So weird. They left early and asked for a refund, but the "free tickets" they were given were just re-entry tickets to the same showing.</Text>

I love downtown Culver City, great parking, great restauants, usually good people. The addition of an Arclight made this my go to destination for dates with the wife.< /Text>

Well of course they raised the prices since the remodel. It’s odd how they don’t have anyone taking your ticket, but I guess that’s because everything automated now. Ya got kids serving behind the counter, so yeah, they’re slow as molasses! At least they have a bar now! I’d rather save money and stay home and watch Netflix!< /Text>

They don't give you a discounted rate for a ealy show. Movie was at 10:30am paid just about $30 for 1 Adult and 1 child. I'm sticking with AMC theaters< /Text>

they never really have good service here.... the theaters will open right at the start time for the movie and the ticket prices arent really worth the service youre getting, yeah you can have beer and wine, whoopi... always long lines and the seats arent that comfortable... unfortunately i am minutes from this theater so I will suffice to say i will return but i never really enjoy the service...</Text>

This is my least favorite ArcLight in Los Angeles.  I love the typical ArcLight experience, but the theaters and screens at this location are small and sub-par for this cinema chain.< /text>

Parking can be tough, it's in a parking garage a couple blocks away. The theater is nice, though - it's an Arclight, so that's to be expected, but still nice!< /Text>

Nice movie theatre with bar and bar food that you can even take into the theatre with you. Added plus: The drinks are served in real glasses, not plastic like in some other theatres.....Parking validation for Trader Joe's and Waseka garage< /text>

Went to see Deadpool 2. When I got to my assigned seat, the guy sitting next to me REEKED of B.O. when I tried telling management, they couldn’t care less. Because seating was assigned we couldn’t sit anywhere else except the very front row. Ruining a date night is one thing but apathetic management is downright insulting.</Review>
