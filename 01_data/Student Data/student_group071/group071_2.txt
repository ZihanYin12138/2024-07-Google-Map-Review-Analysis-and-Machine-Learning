<Text>Our new birthday cupcake spot. Selection is mouth watering. Smells like sweet sugar when you walk in the door. Great customer service. Great price and comparable to cost of a cake. Now everyone gets their choice of cake. Cupcakes are fresh and delicious.</Text>< pictures>

Whenever there is a special occasion I make a order for these assortment of fabulous delicious cupcakes.  Yes, make an order or get there when opening. I have learned my lesson the time I went after work and been in shock when I have seen only two available.  They have both regular size and mini sized cupcakes, they are decorated to perfection and worth every calorie. The best cupcake bakery in town.< /Review>

I called this morning and the lady who answered was clearly busy with customers in the store. The way she handled my call while making her in store customers a priority, as they should be, impressed me a great deal.

Pros: cupcakes are good. My company placed an order of their cupcakes and all the flavors they delivered were good according to my co-workers. I was satisfied with the chocolate cupcake. Price is decent for each once.

Cons: Didnt have much of a variety when I got there at the shop.</Text>

The BEST cupcakes in Fresno, CA no question. They have a large variety of flavors in standard and mini size. They have never let me down.  I think it's their frosting that makes them so craveable. Customer service is just as good as their cupcakes.  Their cinnamon rolls are good too. Plan accordingly because lots of people love this place and they do sell out. 🤗< /text>

Great birthday sweets for my wife's birthday absolutely great cupcakes. Met one of the bakers she was so kind, fun, humble about if we loved her cupcakes. I don't know if she can read this but my wife loved them, I thought my banana one was best cupcake I ate and my kids were finished in less than a blink. I blinked and their cupcake was gone. I think they loved them!!!<//review>

Always so so good and fresh, and the woman that runs the place is a sweetheart.

<rate>1< /rate><Text>In spite of the negative reviews, I decided to give this place a try.  Bad idea. I went in before work to get treats for the office, only to find no product in the cases out front & no menu/pricing posted on the wall.  These are standard-sized cupcakes, individually priced at well over $3 each. There's no price break for purchasing a dozen (which would be a good marketing tool). I purchased a dozen and told them to just give me a variety--which they did.  However, these were NOT freshly baked--they were at least a day old, if not 2,(and yes, I do know the difference!) and the flavor was nothing special.  Sure, they were frosted & some had sprinkles--but again, nothing special.  I could have done them myself at home--at least they'd have been fresh.  I will not be returning. My suggestion--go to the bakery across the street instead.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They were closed, but Karen saw me outside and opened the door. She set me up with the perfect cupcakes I needed for my husbands birthday.  Couldn't believe the excellent customer service and willingness to be so flexible. Went way beyond my expectations and is a true example of a great family owned business serving their local community.<//Text>< Date>

One of my favorite cupcake places in fresno, they have the best frosting, its smooth and creamy. Carrot cake is my absolute favorite from here, I could eat them all day!< /Text>

I ordered cupcakes yesterday and picked them up today for a birthday dinner. We were really excited because last year they were really great . Not only were most of them stale but the frosting was watery and there was nothing special about the flavors. I thought the point of a 24 hour notice was so they were made as fresh as possible. Not the weekend leftovers. Won't go here again and won't recommend anyone here. Wal-Mart has WAY better cupcakes for cheaper. We're super disappointed in you guys!</text>

They have vegan and dairy-free options! I got a coconut soft-serve and loaded it with fruit, nuts, and Oreos. The service was also very friendly. A great place to bring a date after seeing a movie at Regal.</Text>

I tried to resolve my issue by writing directly to the owner of this establishment to no avail.  I think Lisa (the owner) is a nice person, but she simply offered nothing to resolve the only issue I had; letting a kid barely out of high school have the authority to deny our business for no good reason. My girlfriend and I are professional adults and were very disappointed and humiliated by this experience.  We had been going there for years!  I didn't care about the runny yogurt that day, things happen.  I didn't care about having to wait, not the first time.  But exchanging pennies of frozen yogurt for customer loyalty with no offer to make good?  Good customer service comes from the vendor, not the customer's demands.  Otherwise, it would be called customer demands, not service.  I asked if it was her policy to deny service and she never answered yes or no. I asked her two times with no response... so I am left to assume that it is and she doesn’t care about my business. I did reach out to the owner again only to hear more of the same... she will investigate and then asking me to provide customer service to myself.  Think about it... you, a vendor asks what the customer thinks they should receive and then the customer says something and leaves it to the vendor to decide yes or no?  The customer has only one thing to decide, do I shop here or go to another place that offers the same experience... we chose the latter.<//Text>

The service and Frozen yogurt are great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Said hi as soon as we walked in and asked if we needed help, but did not but us when we said no. Great staff. The selection of flavors is good and they offer a lot of toppings, more than others similar places. The only reason for the lost star is the condition of the tables and walls. The tables are at various heights, wobble a lot, and some seem to be coming apart. The floor needs a coating of something and there is a lot of paint chipping and pealing of the walls in the back. Not bad, but not great. Still, the Frozen yogurt and staff more than make up for it.</Text>

Great place to visit, especially on hot days, and usually very delicious. Be careful that they have a high price per how much your cup weighs, worth the price though. They also have free WiFi but you have to ask for the password. Over all it is a pretty good place to visit.< /Review>

<Name>Cannabros Clothing<//Name><review>I don't like the frozen yogurt here. For some reason it tastes like chemicals to me. They have a lot of toppings and my kids like to come here so thats why I gave it two stars. Oh and they always have coupons in the monthly coupon magazine book. I know its a chain and they cant change the recipe but I just dont like the flavor of any of their ice cream. With so many choices for ice cream I don't come here very much anymore.< /review></record>

< review>
Good flavors, plenty of toppings, but snarky and somewhat rude service. asked for a sample cup expecting to be able to get myself the sample like any other frozen yogurt shop, but no... oh no.. the snarky girl had to get it.. mind you I'm a 43 year old adult capable of doing so, not a child or teen.. After we pay, we sat outside enjoying our choices, a family arrived only to be denied access in. Doors locked! It was 9:36pm, the hours posted showed closing time as 10pm and the family challenged her about the posted hours and online hours showing 10pm. She opened the door and told them "we're having trouble with the hours posted, but we close at 9:30pm"...just horrible service in general. I would prefer a different establishment locally rather than this one in the future.<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>This place is amazing. Pretty large inside, only a few tables to sit. There are endless amounts of ice cream to choose from. I was greeted warmly upon arrival and was immediately asked if I needed help or if I wanted any samples. I was just there for the ice cream sandwiches and the staff happily helped me choose from the 5 that were displayed. I also bought a pint of the brumbleberry. All so rich and yummy!

Be warned, it's a bit pricey but definitely worth the money.

Easy to get to (right off the Southport brown line stop)</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great treats. But the coupons only work at the plaza location.  Always in the fine print and never remember until paying for the yogurt when they say full price.< /text>

A delicious treat.  Beware that there are 2 different Cherry on top locations, and this location does not accept the coupons from the other location.</Text>

Quick and casual spot to hang with friends or your significant other in the Woodcrest area. I think this place is really good about their toppings bar, a bunch of different ones to choose from. I usually get cut fruit in my froyo and they always seem to have fresh fruit, even late at night. They switch up their froyo flavors regularly and their good quality. Definitely recommend checking out</Text>

Got oil change here back in October. Went to Valvoline a couple days ago for recent oil change. They could not remove the oil filter cap without damaging it because it was severely over-torqued. Told me I had to return to 76 with the new oil filter for them to replace it. Went back there, told me it would be a two hr wait. Went to a mechanic just to get it done. He tried his best with a blow torch for half hr, and still couldn't remove it. Told me to get a new cap cuz he would have to destroy it to remove it. Not expensive, but an extreme hassle.< /Text>

I generally do all my work on my own vehicles but I get my oil changed here due to the unbeatable price. They never try to upsell me on any repairs or services. For example, I had a small crank seal leak and they put it in the notes and informed me about it. They never tried to push me to get it done there or anything. Another time I came in during a very busy day just before closing and they were able to squeeze me in for an oil change last minute. I havent had anything done there aside from oil changes but I definitely recommend them checking them out. The owner is super cool and honest.</review>

I have been very disappointed my last few visits to this business. I initially went to fix what I thought was an axle issue with my car because I felt rumbling and heard metal clanking. Gentleman who inspected my car took a look for less than 5 min and said I required brake pads, rotors, and hub bearing assembly in the front. Came to pick up my car and I continued to hear initial sounds I pointed out, but now I heard a loud “humming” sound on the freeway! Went back the next business day and a different mechanic took a look at it and discovered that my transmission mount was shattered, so I was driving my vehicle under dangerous conditions.

I’ve been going to this place for the last 3 years even though I live 12 miles away and with plenty of shops in my area (walking distance in fact), and recommended a few people but I feel that once they perform a job, it’s pretty much take it or leave it. So, I went to a different shop and they charged me about 60% less on labor costs! I also changed the brake pads and rotors to the back. Rumbling and metal clanking sounds were gone, but I still heard the “humming” sound so I went back to this shop, since I was under warranty, but have been given the run around: boss is not in at the moment, sometimes aftermarket parts aren’t as good, you’re going to have to drop off your car, mechanic who installed Orta is going on vacation for a week, etc.

Now, on Sunday 5/24/2020, I came to drop off the vehicle so they can inspect the initial job I got in the car but no one is here to take it in. I was instructed by Art (owner) to drop it off before 2pm and no one is here to assist me.

I’m down over $1,500 and wasted a month of my time, and my car still hasn’t been fixed. During a time of chaos with the pandemic and having to run back and forth, wasting time and miles, to have my vehicle fixed. I am extremely saddened and disappointed by 76 pro lube plus customer service. Definitely do your research and get plenty of whites before you take your vehicle in.<//Review>

The price is right. Great value, and excellent customer service. No hard upsale; therefore, I usually don't mind spending on the extras, when the time comes. They earn my business, the old fashioned way: Quality Work.</text>

I love this place! Getting my oil changed is the equivalent of going to the dentist, but the staff here is so amazing and friendly, they always remember old customers and make them feel like family. I found 76 because it was near work, but I continue coming here for the excellent service and fair prices.< /Review>

Much less your ability to stop the car! Can’t put this off, your stuck! So you call around, and everyone you call seems to be 20.00 more than the last guy! But you remember this friendly fair place that’s worked on a few small things before, so you call, they say it’s very hard to price something fairly over the phone when it comes to breaks, bring it here we’ Look at it for free, we’ll they could tell from the fluid leaking out this was bad! So they give you a price, “ almost half “ of what people were throwing out over the phone, they get the parts when they open everything up, it’s twice the work they thought, both rear breaks are leaking! So you’d think “ here it comes the up sell! “ nope!!
They charged me 10 bucks more! I’m telling you places like this just don’t exist anymore, FAIR, HONEST, just great!! I’m a customer for Life!< /Text><userid>106080528697079787225<//userid><GmapID>0x80dd288072e75b15:0x6ae0fb4a6b0b0f07<//GmapID>< Time>

I have gone to this 76 Pro Lube twice now to have my car fixed.  These folks are honest and knowledgeable, so they are great!  Irving has been the mechanic to help me.  Not once has he tried to talk me into an extra fix, which other mechanics have tried in the past.  I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

EDIT: After originally giving this company three stars for the reasons stated below, the owner promptly got back to me and offered me an exchange of the items that I complained about. He was quick to fix my problem and extremely communicative. Th exchanged furniture was in better condition and I'm happy to give them another star for customer service.

Original Post: I ordered a bedroom set including a bed frame, night stand and dresser with attached mirror. I was happy that the delivery took less time than I was originally told but upon putting the furniture together, I realized that the corner of the bed frame had been chipped and many parts of the furniture had been scratched. You could see the brown wood through the black paint. As time went on I came to realize that the paint on all of the items was easily scuffed and scratched and because of this I had to repaint all of the furniture with a new paint to cover up the scratches and prevent any more. Now that I am putting the drawers back into the dresser I am seeing that the drawers are not all even and unless placed back into the dresser in the exact places they originally came in, they do not fit properly, they leave cracks between some drawers and others overlap and do not slide in and out properly. There is no way to tell which drawers go where. On top of this, the drawer handles are all slanted very slightly. I’m quite upset seeing that I paid a decent amount for the bedroom set and it has given me so many problems. Spend a little extra money and get better quality furniture else where.<//Text>

{'time': 1625552552859, 'text': "Hello Brett thanks for taking the time to describe your experience with us your feed back is very important I always take care of my customers that's for sure. sometimes this happens. ( you know is not on my hands) not very often but happens. what we always do is fix or replace the furniture until the customers is completely 100% satisfied. about the drawers sometimes when you take them out and try to put them back is kind of tricky so the best thing to do is for me to send a guy to put them together no additional cost also if you are not completely satisfied with the purchase please give us a call so we can help you choose something better quality (eventhough you already did some painting on the furniture )  if you decide to keep the furniture the drawers have to be placed properly so please call me my cellphone number is 909 214 9733 my name is Ricardo Nuno the owner hope to hear from you Brett thanks"}<//Response>

<Review>I was looking for a king size bed frame as I had just purchased a mattress ( at another location) I found the frame and for a good price and they were able to deliver within 2 days as I needed it in time for my mattress delivery. The delivery was professional and done within the window specified. Ricardo was our sales guy and he was  very helpful and courteous.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I highly recommend USA MEXICO FURNITURE. Ricardo is very warm and professional, he truly values his customers. Ramon was also a pleasure to work with as he explains thoroughly all purchasing options. Go in, look around, ask questions because they have more choices available, this team makes you feel welcome.  Super buenas gentes!</Review>< pics>

Prices are very reasonable but if your looking for a full size bed like we were for a small extra room, better off going elsewhere. But still worth checking out.</review>

Ricardo was great! He helped me find what I need and gave me a great price. Not only that but when I got home I was having trouble putting something together I called him and he took the time to explain what to do. AMAZING customer service! I’d highly recommend this place.</Review>

<user>106563186406998415430<//user><review>Ricardo, the owner and salesman I had the pleasure of buying my mattress was incredibly genuine. He was kind and respectful.

When I went in to buy a mattress I needed one that I enjoy resting on, could bring home the same day, and could have it 0 down financed. USA Mexico Furniture was able to meet that criteria quickly and without hassle.

I would reccomend this store to anyone in need of affordable quality furniture.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

Had a great buying experience yesterday. It was a holiday and they were going to be closing early at 4pm but the owner of the store Ricardo Nuno stayed at the store till 5pm so my wife and I could come by to buy our bed. That's customer service at its best. Thank you again to Ricardo Nuno< /text>

Beautiful "Star of the Sea" - A lovely welcoming Roman Catholic Church. Parish school closed in 2019; traditional classical education starting in 2021. One of many parish churches, built by the faithful San Francisco Catholics of yesteryear. A lovely space to pray and worship. May your fondest prayers be answered, may you be blessed with calm and goodwill.</text>

<Review>Really beautiful parish. The Liturgy is wonderfully and refreshingly reverent and prayerful. It offers Mass in the Extraordinary Form (Latin Mass), Perpetual Adoration in a very nice Adoration Chapel. Multiple opportunities for Confession (I believe 15 minutes before every Mass). The few times I've been around here for events, I can tell they have a really nice community here. If you're in the neighborhood, this is an incredibly solid parish to visit.</Review>< Pics>

So much beauty is great Rx for the mind, heart and soul. There is perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament for Catholics and any person of goodwill that just needs some peace and quiet with the Good Lord. The parish is dynamic and has many varied activities, faith building and outreach. Something for everyone. Parking in back a bit tight but such a blessed relief to have it in The City! The priests are very serious about their ministry and role as shepherds and are true to Catholic teachings. A great place to learn the Catholic Faith or do a reboot for returning Catholics. Great pipe organ too. They exhibit a great deal of warmth and class. A very welcoming place.<//Review>< pictures>

I grew up going to this church. It's beautiful inside. I think it should be tourist stop... Lol! J/k, but you should go and check it out. This is not like a lot of the new churches being built, this one has charm and an old style feel, it is over 150 years old I believe.< /review>

Beatiful church with a supportive community. The priests are traditional, always willing to talk to the parishioners and with confessions before every mass. The church is always open, even is for the homeless that need a place to be warm.
24 hours adoration chapel from Mondays through Saturdays at 4:00 pm. I recommend this parish to any Catholic looking for a great diverse community of truly catholic people.<//text>

The church offers reverance and devotion in the sacrifice of the Latin Mass.  It's not a simple matter of the mass in Latin.  The entire atmosphere is soaked in hundreds of years of tradition and respectful adoration.  If you take the time to learn the Latin you understand that the English versions of the mass (which are called celebrations and not sacrifice) since Vatican II are not at all the same.  There is much to be gained in the prayer and reverance of the traditional mass.<//Text>

<Text>I was baptized at birth (I'm approaching 24 now), and my thoughts on faith, spirituality, god, what have you... Have gone on an interesting journey to say the least. While I still don't at present consider myself a Catholic or a Christian even (or maybe even a theist in the traditional sense of God watching over us and caring for us and guiding us and all that), I have tremendous respect for those with a deep faith in the unknown.

It was following the death of an old family friend, Fr. Francisco Vincente, O.P., that I found myself drawn to Gregorian Chant. This past weekend, while walking the beach listening to Paschale Mysterium, I decided I'd find a Latin Mass. I came to the Sun. 11:30 Mass. It's been a long time since I've been to church that wasn't out of desperation, or to pay respect to the dead, or to fulfill familial duties. And I've never been to a Latin Mass. But I really enjoyed the experience, and I look forward to going again. The pastor gave a tremendous homily too.

EDIT 7/28/18: After sporadically attending Mass (Tridentine of course!) A few more times, I finally began regularly attending starting Easter. In June I moved back out to East Bay, but still try to make it out to Star at least once a month -- the building, the reverence, the priests all hold a special place in my heart.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I just heard on "The Vortex" "Church Militant TV" that you will no longer allow girls to serve at the altar.  Bravo to you Father Joseph, it's about time someone put their foot down on this practice.  Now bring back the altar rail and Communion on the tongue and that will be a big step in the right direction.  I hope more churches follow your lead.</Text>< pics>

<date>1610215984563< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>One of the better Panda Expresses I’ve seen. It’s really big and really clean. They have a separate food-serving area for drive through, which cuts down the general wait time a lot. The staff are pleasant and welcoming. The food is standard PE, so nothing out of the ordinary here. A nice new spot for quick, hot, decent food in Tehachapi. No complaints.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBPtmUFIqVBXOYz6U1ZBvv8BHMdrmu7FJd475r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkf4VxUHw2McxQZT0OVPOyoEwT6wtVCseH1ahw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<text>The drive through took forever even though there was no one in front of me, finally after 20 minutes I got my order. When I got home I realized one of my orders was missing and had to go back to get the rest of my order. I hope they can fix these kind of issues in the future.</text>< pics>

Let me tell you the orange chicken here tastes like it did 10 years ago, it’s cooked just right and they put plenty of sauce on it. I’ve been to many Panda Expresses and it’s always the same dry and hard orange chicken that’s been sitting that they serve to you.

The food was good I ordered my usual and the people that work here actually care which translates into good food.

A++ to the staff for good service, I know it’s not a easy job.</Review>

<Review>I would say it's a nice place it's clean it has a beautiful view the scenery is nice as well, coming out from Santa Barbara of the coast visiting I would say this town is not bad it's small it has its potential to grow. But other than this it's a great place !!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c1f78cd4167551:0xe748a4ee08859ce4</gmap_id>< Date>

The first few times we ate there when they first opened was great. Now the orange chicken comes in a big clump and it is overcooked. The beef is like jerky. Even the chow mein has lost its flavor. I hope management steps up and gets  it together. Crossing my fingers!</Review>

Decent location, only down sides are portions are a little small and I always have to double check to make sure the sauce is in the bag. They have also been inexplicably closed two different times I’ve come during business hours< /review>

We came through the drive through at 9 15 P. M. They said they close at 10:00 so they aren't cooking anymore, 45 minutes before closing and they stop. Rediculous.</Text>

Horrible customer service from I believe “Anna”? As I walked in with my 3 small children I wasn’t even greeted, I was quickly asked “does she have a mask” (pointing at my 3 year old daughter) I told her that she’s only 3 and she has a medical condition restricting her air flow (asthma). The worker says “no she needs a mask, can you leave them outside.” Mind you I’m the only adult with children 7&6 and 3 years old. The rest of us have masks on but she refused to serve us because my toddler didn’t have a mask on due to a medical condition and still refused after telling her she medically couldn’t wear one and she didn’t need to by law anyways because she’s a toddler. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.< /Review>

20 minute wait for fried rice poor management, then to top it off when I got home my order was wrong. Ordered honey sesame chicken breast and Beijing beef and I recicieved beef and broccoli,  with no beef all broccoli and honey sesame chicken breast. The rice was crunchy and under cooked, bad experience< /Text>

The food is what you would expect, nothing great but still good enough to go back. The service is friendly and at times rushed but that is understandable when they're busy. No indoor seating and mask are required.</text>

1st bad experience. Ordered online. Got there and the doors were locked. Employee motioned me to go through drive thru. After waiting in line, employee at the window said they ran out of rice and it would be another 10min so park out front. In the meantime they let two other patrons in to pick up their orders, although they had to wait as well. 20min later they brought my order out but at least with an apology and smile.
When I got home, found a pile of rice under my teriyaki chicken, so less meat. Not cool...</Text>

Fast and Friendly service. Very consistent with other Panda Express locations. Fair warning, the line can get quite long, but it's faster then you may expect</Text>

I thought the reason they had it was to make ordering faster and easier.

Staff are extremely rude. I will not be back. The business model of a new restaurant should not be to upset the local clientele. Ask Dunkin’ Donuts about this< /Text>

Probably the least-liked of the Panda Express's that I eat at between Atascadero and Palmdale. Food taste is the same as others.....I don't fault them there. Here's where I knock off two stars; 1st the Portions are slightly under what other Panda's give. 2nd..they close the grill roughly at 7pm or before. By 730pm they start running out of choices. This slows down service to not only walk-ins but the drive-thru. This is bad. We eat there two to three times a month...if we go there after 7pm , I notice each car in drive-thru stays at the speaker 5 to 10 minutes and there's usually 3-5 cars there at that time of night. You will wait in line 30-plus minutes.
Also there's never any fresh vegetables...regardless of what time of day we go , we always have to wait on vegetables.<//Text>

Not great. Honey walnut shrimp was terrible. Seemed like it was old, stale, and chewy.  Weird. No indoor dining yet and I have no idea why not. You can go inside to order but everything is to go only.  They don't even let you work the drink fountain yourself.  Just bizarre.  Employees were friendly, though, so there's that.</Review>

Given the prime Downtown location of this particular Walgreens, this is a good option for pharmacy or basic home supplies. However, it is rather small and has a limited selection. Additionally, the interior is somewhat rundown and decrepit. It’s doesn’t feel clean or sophisticated. I don’t think this is necessarily the fault of the staff, simply the building. All in all, a good resource for those Downtown.< /text>

This happens to be a really nice pharmacy store that delivers brand name drugs at a fair price. All the products I have bought from this pharmacy have been the same medication specified by my doctor. Both items were labelled with the name and place of the original manufacturer on the date of manufacturing and expiry. I'm sure I'm happy I found this pharmacy.< /Text>

<Review>Thank you so much Doctor Kiet! I needed a ointment against my inner thigh itching. It is saturday, it was kind of empty. Mr. Kiet even walked me to the aisle and explained everything to me in a basic way so I could follow him. It is so unusual professionals taken their time to even walk you to the aisle and grab the ointment you need. Once again, great job :)<//Review>< resp>

Ordering was quite quick and quite accommodating, and forgiving when I had trouble with my credit card constantly rejected due to out-of-country transactions. The meds inside the package is tightly packed in ideal condition. Thank you very much!<//Text>

Live in Atlanta, GA and can't really drive to the store to talk to someone.  Finally was able to talk to an employee and all they did was take my information.  Come to find out that they cannot even text or email me a copy of the receipt.</review>< pictures>

This Walgreens pharmacy is amazing. The pharmacists are so helpful and have really helped me to get what I needed when I needed it despite a crazy travel schedule, even if they didn't have it in stock themselves.

I wish these pharmacists were in my hometown SF. I would go there all looked the time!<//Text>

I went to this store and planed to get a baby lotion for my son today,  and I had to press the customer service button to take the stuff I wanted, the funny thing was I pressed the button twice and waited over 5 minutes for the service but NOBODY showed up, just the broadcast saying'Customer service needed in the baby department' again and again, it was not that busy around 1 pm on Wednesday. If no help could be provided to your customer, then don't put the button there,OK?<//text>

Hands down the best pharmacy in downtown Los Angeles. I come here for everything and the staff knows me by name and is welcoming. You don't feel like your number here on the contrary they know you and your medical needs. You can get vaccinations here and I do. I love this place I moved here from The rite aid across the street. When I moved here the rite aid asked me to stay but I did not and I have not regretted that one minute in the last 4 years.< /Text>

<Review>Probably the slowest pharmacy service I’ve ever received. There was an issue with how they were processing my insurance and while it could have been solved by asking me a very simple question, they took more than 20 minutes among themselves to try and figure it out before asking me. After that it took an additional 30 minutes to get my medications, which were non-controlled substances. No idea why this took so long, but it made me late to work on what should have been an hour lunch break.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b43f15085b:0xc087f0d755542b95</gmap_id></record>

The pharmacy at this store is easily the best in DTLA. Super helpful and friendly pharmacists and staff. An 11 out of 10. Unfortunately, the rest of the store is the exact opposite. Long lines, items (particularly sale items) out of stock, unhelpful front clerks.<//review>

< Review>
They suck I bought some medicine there and then my 2 kids needed to used the restroom and a worker told me only customers so I told him that I bought some stuff there and then they told me the restroom didn’t work. My 2 kids almost pee themselves a boy of 7 and 5 years I mean it sucks that they even do that to the kids I was really upset 😡 about it and I will never go to the store again.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) You can buy American petite plastic cosmetics

I bought a lot of souvenirs of BURT'S BEES as souvenirs (* ∇ `*)

There was also polish and nails!

As bags are charged, let's go with eco-friendly bags

It is the target that other cosmetics are available near here

袋は有料なのでエコバッグ持参で行きましょう

<Text>(Translated by Google) Perla is an extraordinary girl, very sweet and committed, she always receives me with a warm smile, she worries about having the time to reffill her or she looks for a way to look for her in another branch, she makes my wait minimal and very pleasant, she treated me 2 days ago Layla surprised me that she knew why the medicine was going and helped me to find some vitamins that I needed, usually it is Perla who attends me and I always hope to see her, but this time Layla surprised me with her dedication and kindness, I think they are the best girls in walgreen and that visited several branches.

(Original)
Perla es una chica extraordinaria muy dulce y comprometida siempre me recibe con una calida sonrisa,  se preocupa por tener a tiempo los reffill o busca la manera de buscarla en otra sucursal, hace que mi espera sea mínima y muy agradable, hace 2 días me atendió Layla me sorprendió que sabía porque medicamento iba y me ayudó a buscar unas vitaminas q necesitaba, por lo regular es Perla quien me atiende y siempre espero verla, pero está vez Layla me sorprendió con su dedicación y amabilidad, creo que son las mejores chicas de walgreen y eso que visitado varias sucursales.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

Took a bite, and found MOLD in my bun. DISGUSTING. Also the patty had NO FLAVOR. From my observance, they used frozen patties. Had to throw everything out! Beware of what they serve you!</Review>< username>

< Review>
Tasty, not too oily, double patty cheeseburger. The atmosphere is okay and the place is fairly clean. Service is average. Aside from being only half a block from Union Square, there is little else that is particularly outstanding about Burgerhouse.</Review>

<rating>3<//rating><review>I wish there was an option to give 3.5 stars on Google because I would for Burger House. The only reason I'm not giving them 4 stars is that the shake I had was not good, the garlic fries were incredibly oily, and the food is expensive for what it is. That said, the Cheese burger was excellent and the service was pretty quick. I came in on a pre-Christmas Friday night and the streets were filled with Christmas shoppers and tourists. I like the counter seating there and was able to enjoy my burger comfortably in spite of it being pretty crowded. Burgers there are solid, but I don't recommend the shakes or the garlic fries!< /review>< Pictures>

A preferred site for Burgers. Filled me up in no time. Looking forward to returning with my relatives. The bill was fair I would say. Kinda of like a cafe in Phoenix that I enjoyed.</text>

Went to the Burger House a year ago and it was fantastic! A year later it was OK, thus a 4 star rating. They downsized the burger menu (2 choices) and added crepes. The food quality is still excellent but service seems to be lacking. Now they are just an ordinary burger stand that sells crepes.<//Text>

<Text>Average burger and fries. The customer service was crappy. Nothing really special about this place. A lot of people serm to want their crepes. I would recommend that people who live in the Bay Area go somewhere else. This place is mainly for tourists. Also, be careful with your belongings. My backpack was stolen at this place. The place has several doors leading to several other establishment. Go to Super Duper for a better burger experience.<//Text>< Pics>

It was "okay". Nothing special at all with the burger's or the meat. Honestly, at that price... you should probably just go to In-N-Out. Twice.

Their sweet-potato fries are great tasting though, although they seemed cold on the inside.< /Text>

Previous review:

I don't eat a lot of red meat, but these Niman Ranch burgers are a great, and way cheaper than you'd pay elsewhere for the quality. At the moment, the menu is reduced and they are selling through a "pop-up" menu in the place next door.< /text><Rate>4<//Rate>< user>

Today I bought my lunch here and while I was eating I saw a roach climb out of the milk shake machine and up the wall near the hamburger bread and then i saw another one. I will no longer go here to buy food at all until they clean up the kitchen why hasn't the food inspector come and do a walk through of this restaurant...</Review>

There was a long wait for a hard patty without much flavor. It is a matter of taste but I personally didn't enjoy the bun in particular. Didn't try the fries so have no opinion there.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I think it's good if you want to taste American burgers. The price is reasonable, and Coke is an infinite refill.

(Translated by Google) The ingredients are fine and good to be near Union Square. But it doesn't have a special taste

Fresh ingredients and easy to access but that's all. Common taste. You can taste this anywhere.

Formosa Cafe is an awesome place to get fresh delicious food. The owner treats you with kindness and love. My husband and I have been going there for years and we have never been disappointed. Her Peking beef is made with tender beef that just melts in your mouth. And Her Egg Flower soup is the Best in Sacramento!!!  We feel comfortable eating there, as if we are having dinner with family!!! And  lets not forget about May's mother who works there too. She is just adorable! She has always made us feel like family!! If you want Asian,awesome tasting food, come to Formosa. I promise you won't be disappointed. I forgot to mention that the amount of food that you get is so much that you will be taking home leftovers!!!! This family style restaurant is a must visit if you're in Sacramento!!! One other thing I must mention. We celebrated my husband's 50th birthday here and we were so happy that we did.</text>

I ordered to go it was my very first time there. This place had high ratings so I decided to try them out. You will not be disappointed, let me tell you why..... the quality and quantity is great! You must!! try the War Won Ton Soup. The fried shrimp were ok but I've had better. I ordered combination fried rice no pork it was very good and the portion was huge. So in short, it will not be disappointed at all believe me.< /text>

<Review>This is one of the best places to go for Chinese food. The service is great, it's a mom & pop store, and they really do use quality ingredients. The food is made fresh and they even make their own pot stickers. The War Wonton Soup is very tasty and if you like hot & spicy they can do it. They even made me Peking Duck, which was very tasty.(Had to order in advance.)<//Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Family run establishment with great food and reasonable prices. As it is a family restaurant, service is personal and the owner's attitude is great unless you're rude then, not so much.  Overall great place to get great Chinese food without paying 5 🌟 prices.<//Text>< pics>

Best food, huge portions, and the proprietress May is perhaps the kindest, most dedicated business owner ive ever met. Her produce is THE FRESHEST. I always feel like she's reinvented bok choy,  it's always that good. And her crab rangoons make everyone else's taste like sadness. Her egg rolls? I bet you've never had them like May's.< /text>

<Text>The food was very good and service very friendly and courteous but the only thing that made me upset was the fact that we wanted to order pork chop suey with a large share of rice and split she said that wasnt allowed I had to order another entree we could take it to go. It was dissapointing what difference does it make if you bring us another plate anyhow we took it home and ate. Wish she could change that policy. One share was more than enough. Aside from that everything was great. Little inconvenience still dont understand it.<//Text><Date>1554511340665<//Date>< user_id>

<review>Drive thru only but is pretty fast most of the time. If anything avoid ordering past 7pm because it gets so busy. Walk up window is open until 6pm if you want to avoid the line. Food is still good and staff is friendly. Let me express that their is no restroom access if you’re traveling. Plenty of parking if you’re taking a break for all vehicles except 18 wheelers.<//review>< Name>

The food came out good . There is a children's play area and the restrooms were clean. The staff were so well organized, kudos to their training and manager. Overall, I would recommend this McDonald's, you'll have a Happy Meal.< /review>

Used the app to place an order.  When I arrived at this location I could not get to the curbside pickup spots.  The drive thru has a barrier to direct traffic but this makes the drive thru the only lane on the back of the restaurant.  Other than that my order was correct and food is on par with my expectations of McDonald's.</text>

This McDonald branch started to charged almost everything now since the pandemic started. They used to give out free sauces etc. Now even extra pump of hazelnut or vanilla creamer and extra sauce they charged it. Just saying. Staff are nice.<//review>

<review>So went to McDonald’s drive thru and only got half the order.Makes you mad when you get home and find only part of a order, pain to have to dive back down there again. How hard is it to put the order in the bag. Very disappointed!!< /review>< Pics>

There are many times that they just serve you something as simple as coffee like slop.  Coffee drips everyone because of the way they serve it.  We go on vacation to Estes Park,. Colorado every year, while the wait is long, they never serve their coffee like the one in menifee does. My brother-in-law even said that they served him his coffee with the lid not on all the way. If I could give zero stars I would.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Google said they were open and the door said the open at 6am, but we were told they wouldn’t open until 7am. We were in an RV so we couldn’t go through the drive thru, which was open.< /text>

<Text>Wow!! Very unorganized. Don’t bother with the walk up window. We had a simple order of one happy meal and fries and we waited for a good 20 minutes LONGER than what we would have had we just waited in the long drive thru lane! (Saw the car that was behind us before we pulled out of the drive through, drive away as we stood outside in the heat at the walk up window!) Then..... on top of that my husband had to run around the other side of the building because they accidentally walked out to the car waiting spot FOR THE DRIVE THRU!!! Absolutely awful.</Text>< Rate>

Cheap food equals cheap service, cashier didn’t know how to put in my order, forgot my ranch with my food, so since I didn’t want to deal with her I went back to my car and ordered on the app and still they couldn’t get that right. Gave me a hot coffee when I ordered an iced coffee THROUGH THE APP. I said screw this and didn’t want to have them fix it cause they’d end up probably spitting in my drink. This McDonalds sucks< /review>

But this one I will leave a review for. I was there on a very busy day and they got my order wrong (an honest mistake) but the manager came to our table and made it right and even went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. I didn’t see a name tag cause it was a rainy cold day and she had a knit style sweater. But she didn’t have to go that far with making right. Very much appreciated manager lady, wish I would have caught your name to give you proper kudos on here.</Text></record></dataset><record>

If you are looking for something to fill you in given your busy schedule, dine at McDonald's. Food is always mediocre but their coffee maybe one of the better ones in town for the value you get.</review>

Service is ok. One thing crew members need to do is have the exterior spotless. As I was waiting in drive thru, I saw the entire trash can emptied out onto the floor. Disgusting!! And it’s not the first time I see this mess. They should know cleaning procedures by now...to take out the trash when closing up.< /Text>

Was definitely a pretty cool experience (a blast in the past feel). The preserved portion of the restaurant seemed a bit dim. It was like an abandoned museum of sorts. They should use better lighting at night and keep preserving the 50's style and feel, it could use more flare.<//text>< pics>

<review>2 complaint's to start with:
First, need more and bigger "no smoking" signs on their patio
Second, because they do NOT have power outlets in the DINING ROOM, they are NOT in compliance with ADA.
If someone can NOT charge their cell phones, how are they going to CHARGE a WHEELCHAIR?
As far as truck and RV parking, they have plenty of room and this place is extremely easy to spot both in traffic and from the freeway< /review>< pictures>

Food was good EXCEPT for the fries, they were hot but tasted stale and lacked salt. Also ordered food to eat there but they bagged all the orders to go and refused to call out the table marker numbers which kinda added to the confusion on whether they wanted us to leave or actually eat there< /text>

This lady Jessica the a.m shift manager was very rude. I ordered clearly and said it 4 times and they still got it wrong. When Jessica the shift manager asked me if there was a problem I explained to her and she said honey this is corporate America.  I told her I'd like to reorder my food and she gave me a huge attitude and told me no< /text>

Same ol McDonald's menu but with an updated ordering model. It was pretty cool to us the giant touch screens, take a number and wait for your food. Whole process is pretty smooth after going though it.<//review>

Went threw the drive thru. They got my order wrong. I ordered 2 Big MAC meals,  they tried to give me Quarter Pounder meals. I'm glad I looked at my receipt. When I brought it to their attention they gave me cold fries, and cold Big Macs with NO BIG MAC SAUCE! $20 for 2 meals and this is what happens! I will not be going back. I get better service and better food from Del Taco right next door. Soda was flat and the Iced tea tasted like it's been sitting for days. McDonald's sucks!!! I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!!</review>

The first McDonalds you hit on way to LA that is NOT in the desert and what I use as my reference as 'finally closing in on SoCal'... It's standard Mc Donald's fare.  What else can be said?<//review>

I ordered the chicken strips and they were out. I had to eat the chicken McNuggets which aren't as tasty to me. I was very disappointed. Their Wi-Fi was down as well.</Text>

Ordered a couple happy meals & burgers @ 3:37pm, didn't get our food until 4:03. I looked at the wrappers of the sandwich and the time was 3:41??? So our food sat there for that long before they brought it to us. Paid $21 for horrible food, bad service & I do not recommended this McDonald's 👎< /text>

It looks nice inside,but our order wasn't taken correctly. When we realized the guy who brought our food to us unwrapped a burger and lifted up the lettuce, and everything else with is hands and stated that it was made correctly and tried to hand it back to me. We had to make him realize what he did and to go remake it.<//Text>

Worst morning MCDONALD experience. Too many customers and not enough management - lots of workers running around dealing with customers with the loudest mouth. End result - couldn't handle orders or customers expectations. Waited over 20mins and then got my money refunded. Was not worth the wait or the money.</review>

Slowest service, wrong order received, generic toys (asked for 2 boy toys and received an old Hello Kitty and a Peter Pan figurine.....weird) drink was to be lemonade doe child ended up being Sprite.....wth nobody pays attn here to order and handed out wrong items, THIS IS NOT the 1st time thus location has totally missed the mark. Too far to drive back before noticed with kids in vehicle. McDonalds has to be the worst fast food and is only used as a last resort and kids no no better. We will no longer support this establishment or any other McD facilities as quality has been worse than ever, not to say they were ever great however recent experiences have influenced a ban on the Ronald. 1/16 star rating if available.< /Review>

<Text>It is very busy.  Was told to use the kiosk to order,  however I could not customize my order. When we explained it to the manager she was quite rude. I would really like to have sausage gravy and biscuits, which you don't have here.  I'm from the Midwest where we have it😥</Text>< pictures>

I’m giving 5 stars because of my experience last night! I went through the drive thru and ordered four cheeseburgers but instead called them Krabby Patties. The girl who took my order went along with my Spongebob reference and asked if I wanted a kelp shake or a kelp fry with my krabby patties. I just appreciated that she went along with my nonsense, so thank you Rosie for making my night!< /review>

A few oddities this time but still received great service. Tried to get a double smokehouse bbq burger and the associate said it "was not available" I questioned that because all it is is an additional party. Anyways, he put it in as a custom order. I ordered the meal and I got my drink cup but when the meal came, there were no fries. I asked about it but noticed I wasn't charged for a meal. I gave the associate my receipt and he told me he'd get me the fries. I had gotten the drinks before I got my burger so I knew I had asked for a meal. The associate was really friendly and apologetic and I got the drinks and fries for free. 3 star establishment, 5 star employee. Thanks Carlos!<//review>

This is TERRIBLE store, as a retired Manger, from South Carolina our store was, and is a Cooperate Store. Time Goals were set and meet. Cleanliness was always keep in he Bathroom and Dining area. for Breakfast, there were always a lead Crew Person, or Ast. Mgr. making Dining room checks, while pouring Coffee, or water, while asking the patrons how there how is there services.    I still remember, to TRY to meet, and serve the customer in less than a min. (60), in the Dinning area while window sales under 2min, (120 sec) There is no since of  URGENCY !!! TO SERVE THE CUSTOMER. without them there is no Store.
An if this is a Franchise Store then In my opinion, your doing a disservices by the standards that were set in Head Quarters in Illinois.
I love the food, Ill continent to eat there, sparingly, with great trepidation.<//text>

Getting too expensive. Fish  fillet small drink gobs of fries 10 bucks. I could go to a restaurant be served and have salad or soup entrees and dessert for what we paid at Mickie Dees. Just mine and my daughters view on this< /review>

It took me to ask 4 different staff workers that was just standing around to get a Mac sauce for  me and the store wasn't busy. By the time I was given the sauce, my burger and fries was cold.  Only in Banning store will you find poor service. We always hope that things would change but I think I'll be done after waiting for years now. When looking at Beaumont and Cabazon Stores their service is clean, fast and food always taste hot and fresh. I personally recommend just going outside Banning to get quality service and a hot meal for the money.< /Review>< pictures>

Why is it so difficult to have two cheeseburgers with lettece, tomatoe, mayo only? ??? We had pickles & onions and it was $14.00!!! I guess it was a superior that redid the burgers and refunded us $!!! OMG-WHY I NEVER LIKE FAST FOOD & BECUZ I USUALLY DONT FEEL WELL AFTERWARDS. I try to avoid fast food whenever possible..and geez...could eat a steak for those prices! OMG NOPE NOT GOOD AT ALL!❗< /Review>

Only good thing about this McDonald's, is that they have free mini icecream cones. Legit. Customers; like myself had to deal with rude staff, they feel free to say whatever they want; l  unnecessary rude comments that isn't needed or wanted while ordering the food. Also, The manager is one unprofessional female that doesn't care for her own customers satisfaction, she was upset that the food was cold after sitting on the counter for approximately 15 minutes. Was very loud about it. Then here is additional fact to this place,  Bathroom is disgusting, the employees put the toilet rolls on the floor to use. This is the worst McDonald's I ever been at . Lucky enough to even get 2 stars for the free ice cream cones.<//text>

What happened to this place ? I walked in and ordered 1 burger  a drink and it took 45 min...
I'm serious , the soft drink machine wasn't working , no ice tea ,  the manager was running around the place with a pipewrench in her hand..I couldn't believe this place..when I finally received my burger the bun was hard . .this place really needs help from corporate , they could do a lot better with a group of monkeys from a zoo..< /review>

< Review>
This McDonald's charges higher than surrounding areas. I ordered a bacon and cheese sandwich meal and the price was 7.21 compared to 5.92 at cabazon and calimesa. The employee stated that all McDonald's charge different prices and its bcuz the area was busy and off the freeway, which makes no sense...sandwich was rubbery as if it had been microwaved...I will NOT be going back< /Review>

Dirty. Smells like pee. Lots of homeless in this area 😢. Force you to use a kiosk to order. People crowded around waiting to pick up their orders. Hot and muggy. On the plus side, i got lucky and my fries were hot.</Review>

A little rough around the edges. Order from the TV menu in lobby...you won't have to deal with employees and your food will be ready quickly. Great parking lot and drive through.< /review>

The best thing they have done is serve breakfast all day. The young lady at the window was very nice and efficient. We visited again. We used the kiosk to order and pay. We waited almost 30 minutes. My grandson went to the counter and asked if our order was ready. He was told they never got it. He gave them the receipt. When our order finally arrived it was in a bag. We ordered eat in. I was told they were out of hashbrowns. Not a problem. However, we ordered 1 small fry and 1 medium. They just brought the medium. Two smoothies were ordered, 1 strawberry banana and 1 mango. Both smoothies were mango, not what we ordered. They were also not filled to the line but about a half inch below the fill line.  When our order was finally brought to us we were told the number was called out but we did not hear it . At any other McDonald's when a number is on the table it is brought to the table. All trash barrels were overflowing and being ignored by all employees. It was not that crowded that it could not be emptied.  I will not go to this store again.</review>

Used the McDonald's app and took 30 minutes to get our food. If they're not going to be able to use the app as intended, they should opt out. Efficiency is important in providing quality service to customers...< /Text>

Ive been going to this mcdonalds for years its always been great. Today is the first time it wasnt i paid in the Kiost Machine and it didn't give me a receite. I had special orders and it didnt provide me with those specific orders. I am very dissapointed that not only that. But the frys had very bad taste they were either not salted, or over cooked. The meat was a little pink. And When i had left I also got a stomach ache I shouldnt be gettign stomach aches from a place that i always eat. Im very dissapointed! There were also no condimits. I got up about 4 to 6 times to have my meal corrected.<//text>

<Review>Worst experience ever. I ordered at the kiosk and I waited in line just to have an old lady be really mad at me for no reason. The old lady was the manager at the McDonald's location I was at. Then the same old lady kicked all of us teenagers out. I had no time to eat. I just wanted to enjoy my food after I had a competition and didn't eat since 2 PM. You should employ better people. This kind of attitude is unacceptable. I feel really ashamed of this fast food restaurant. Palm Springs and other desert locations do a better job than this.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I waited 10 minutes in line to buy a frap and turn out the frap machine didn't work, why don't they put a sing so that we know before we waste time in line. Also they did charge me for the frap</Review>

A little dirty, but I continued in the line to order anyway. Food and coffee was overall good. But honestly, because of the lack of better cleanliness, I will plan to stop somewhere else the next time I'm driving through. 3 stars for food, 1 star for cleanliness; 2 stars overall.<//Review>

Came here for a quick bite on the way to Joshua Tree. The staff was very friendly and upgraded my small fries to a large because he felt it took a long time to get the food, but I don't think I was waiting for more the 5-8 minutes, which I actually thought was pretty reasonable for the amount of people in line and in the drive thru. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area again. Thanks McDonalds!< /text>

Used the kiosk & received food quickly. However, I had to go ask for a cup. The beverage area was messy & almost out of straws. Dirty tables, quite a few people behind the counter, 1 person on register & a line to the door.</Text>

Convenient, reliable fast food. Good chicken nuggets and fruit smoothies. McCafe coffee is surprisingly good and a good value. Hamburgers are so so.< /Review>

I bought 1 large soda-$1.08. I gave the casbier $10.10. After 3 attempt to give me change- which l repeatedly handed back- told him it was $9.02--l settled at $7.75-said to give me my cup please. He handed me a small water glass. I dont know it he was stoned or stupid--butseveral people watching walked out. Dont they evaluate people before handing them a cash register?<//Review>

<UserId.>100742154500248727465<//UserId.><text>Now you have to understand  I have been to McDonald's restaurants before but I have never seen one in such a disorganized manner in handling food orders now before I start get comfortable now if it weren't  so funny i would have left right away hahaha. I watched one person start  filling a drive thru order and another  person finished it and pass it out the window  then the first person came looking for the order with the remaining  food item and was looking everywhere for it it was funny I finally yelled the other girl finished it and another girl passed out the window  this happened more than once each time different persons but the slap stick comedy  was the same you had to laugh when they spent time looking  everywhere going back and forth for the half bagged order. Now once I received my order which was bagged when I was going to eat in i walked over to the  drinks BIG MISTAKE BIG MISTAKE once I stood in front of the drink dispenser I was STUCK TO THE FLOOR BY SOME STICKY UNKNOWN  SUBSTANCE  MY SHOES WERE GLUED THERE. AS I REACHED FOR THE COUNTER TO GIVE ME LEVERAGE TO SET FEET FREE MY HAND WAS OVER TAKEN BY STICKY SLIMM now I was into it feet stuck and my hands in STICKY slim with my free hand I filled my cup with water  and poured it first on my hand then feet and freed  my self.  But the adventure was not over the entire floor from the drink area to the front door was sticky with each step I though I was going to lose my shoe as I carefully made my way to a table I noted it was dirty and by all accounts looked sticky so I decided not to take a chance and sit I took my food and decided to eat in my car BIG DISAPPOINTMENT the food was NOT FRESH OR CORRECT  made the decision not to go back in to risky  the service  was awful the food cold and disappointing I won't  be going back there again unless I want to see a comedy show but I will bring my own food.<//text>< date>

<text>I’m in the CCHS marching band color guard and we had just finished competing at RCC and we stopped to eat at this McDonald’s and the manager was being so rude and disrespectful towards us when all we wanted to do was eat peacefully after a tiring and long day. She kept slamming the door shut and kept yelling at people outside and kicked all of us out and someone even told me she flipped us off when we left. Please fire her!<//text><date>1541364335953< /date>< pics>

<review>McDonald's is McDonald's the only difference is some McDonald's process and get your food out to you in a quick manner others like this particular location takes forever and all they want to do is talk to the other employees rather than getting your food out to you or putting your fries in the bag in Waiting three or four minutes to put your hamburger so you've got hot hamburger cold fries< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Manager was being rude, disrespectful, and racist towards a group of Hispanic students. She kicked us out because it was “closed” and yelled at one of the students. We were just trying to have a proper meal and she was more worried about her door being open rather than attending her costumers. Please fire her. She’s white and fat and made me feel uncomfortable.<//text>

They definitively need more staff! They were in a chaos situation when we were there on a Sat 10 pm evening.  A man complaining no peco in his burger, while the nice lady worker apologized that she is doing 3 things at a time and her co worker cashier is in break ..... so nobody could help her at the moment ...... god! she was so nice! so patient!</text>

<review>I went through drive thru and order a "big Mac " and it was only the patties and bread no sauce, cheese, etc.etc. it wasn't even a special order.  I think the employees need some extra training, especially working at McDonald's.<//review></record>

<Review>We ordered our food to go and decided to eat inside. Thankfully we did because they forgot the fries and bbq sauce from the kids meal. The manager got us a larger order fries to try abd make up for it which we greatly appreciated. On our secind order it took over 10 minutes to get our food with no one else in there and then when they gave it to us they said it would be another 12 minutes for thw apple pies that were part of the order because no one told them they needed to make more. The entire staff seemed like a hot mess. Also the bathrooms were disgusting and poured water out of the handles when you went to flush them.< /Review>< pics>

This place is either good or completely horrible..
Always having to wait for food that isn’t even fresh 80% of the time and after waiting 20+ minutes to the side the car that pulls up next gets their food at the same time as us..
In the bag, no Ketchup but this time we had napkins when we don’t half the time, the sad thing is we only eat here maybe 3x a month and this is almost always the same type of thing we deal with.
This place is lucky most of the guests are from the freeway and will never return to complain.
In total for this 30+ minutes of waiting we only ordered two McMuffins and four hash browns.
I manage a food venue that sees 2000+ guets per day and is NOT fast food and we still have faster and definitely friendlier service than this place.

After writing this review on the way home about 3 minutes away, I open my muffin and found a hair in it unfortunately, so I went back and spoke to the manager around 3pm and he handled what I was saying very well and apologized and offered my food re made or a refund, I chose the refund and it was issued quickly. Thank you edited from one to three stars for professional manager<//Text>

The Playland is completely falling apart and smells like urine something should probably be done about that however they got two stars because they updated everything else even though that's not what needed the update the line is extremely fast at the drive-thru but it's McDonald's foods not great their ice cream however is bomb<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><review>I hate this Mc Donald's unfortunately it's the only one in our area in Palm Springs. It's always filthy, never give you your right order so you might as well just say "give me a surprise" and it may be what you want finally. Most of the time they don't have Coke or it's terrible, so I don't go there for me my kids might just want a quick burger and we make it through the drive thru ok sometimes with that kind of order. I hope they will get a new staff and caring workers one day soon, hey I will even consider to help with management and staff detail.< /review></record>

The worst customer service ever, it takes 20 -25 minutes for an order to be completed.. our 10 piece glaze was shorted, we got 5 regular pieces, 2 had one side not breaded and 6 nugget size pieces. My husband called when he got home,  spoke to the assistant manager who hung up on my husband three times, because he kept telling her, 'I did not order fries'.

I called Corporate to complain, I was told to go back, that a manager would call, that didn't happen.  They did replace my tenders all one piece.  I'm surprised they have received numerous calls for the lines inside and out, the long waits.< /Text>

<review>I lived in banning for over 23 years. I can honestly say this is the worst Mcdonalds to eat. Many people that live here agree with what im commenting with the service they give us. We ask for fresh fries and they dont care to make some fresh ones. There Frappe machine is always being cleaned. They keep giving different hours when they clean the machine. Worst place to eat very unprofessional!!</review>< time>

Still a great menu and value pricing and an EV charging station but the remodel and touch screen ordering stations have left very little lobby space.  On busy days a crowd froms and also mistakes can happen in orders.<//Review>

Service was slow mostly because of the high demand and low employees working. I felt bad for them. A lot of customers were upset. However, in my case they had no pies while I had already paid for them. I asked what I could get instead and the employee rudely just told me she didn't care (to let me go on my way) another cashier smiled shyly at me knowing that the other girl had been rude. I got a parfait....instead of two items I had paid for and just left. Didn't feel like adding on pressure to those poor girls.< /Text>

Sucks,  I have never gotten fresh French fries from McDonalds in Mentone,  the closes they have ever come is when I got raw fries,.
Also,  the manager has a scam with the drive-thru,  where they charge you for the more expensive items and give you the cheap items,  and don't give you your receipt,  and if you catch it before you get home,  the manager gets all rude and won't give you the area managers number,< /Review>

<Review>Long wait. Food is terrible. Prices are too high for what you receive. Kitchen is dirty. Menu switches so fast you can't read what's on it.

This place was filthy. Crew members did not wear gloves and were handling food. Counters dirty, a "team member had glitter on his face, neck and arms" I personally witnessed one person leaving the prep area, go outside coming back in without washing his hands. I asked for the manager, a young person  looked at me like a deer staring into headlights.
Yes, I did call corporate office that day they were closed so I lk SVT a message and called back two days later, gave a report.
Won't go back.<//Review>

<review>Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Went through the drive thru and they charged us for 2 fries we didn't want. We told them and they said to go to the second window. They said they couldn't do anything so we went in. We got our food and literally every single item was wrong. We kept going back and showing them and they were rude and disrespectful and the manager would say "what happened now" when it's completely their fault. They didn't even make their own burger right. In a happy meal we got 6 fries. Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. We weren't the only one, people kept coming in and complaining and one guy waited 10 minutes for a small fry. & they didn't even apologize once.</review>< Pics>

It's really busy and they dont have the food ready they make you pull over and wait if you go in the drive through I had to wait 8 mins for fries I expected it to be fast but it took me 27 mins to get my food from the time I ordered to the time I received my food< /text>

<text>Do not eat here. They are trying to make people sick. I got a half cooked fish sandwich and really cold fries. Also have a Big Mac in the bag and I'm scared to bite into that. This is McDonald's, it should be uniform across the board. Just because this is a small town does it mean if McDonald's gets to not be like every other McDonald's there is.

My visit on 2/18 left me very disappointed and still hungry.  I went theough the drive through very early in the morning, where I was told they were only accept cash at the time so I was limited to whatever I could pay for with the change in my car, lol.  What I did get was barely warm and my fries, something I've always looked forward to when getting them from MCDonald's, were soggy and simply yucky.</text>

I have been here twice with my 4 year old grandson.Services are quite poor,from staff to food quality. Another thing I would like to address,is both times we have been here, my grandson comes down with some adverse sick episode.
WHEN was the last time the play area was SANITIZED!?!?!  It's disgusting! !</review>

Awful. Everything about this location was terrible. I waited 20 minutes to get a cheeseburger happy meal and a big mac. This wasn't even through the drive thru. The management said ZERO to me, even though I overheard her yell back to the cook to get my remaining big Mac for the lobby as a customer (me) was waiting a super long time. Ugh. Once I got the cheeseburger for my picky eater, I had to wipe off half of the over-abundant amount of ketchup. No apology from any of the staff. I will NOT be going back.</Review>

Good to dine in with family. They even take the food to you. The drive thru is kinda terrible...takes longer to be serviced and people try to cut in front of you because drive thru line is on one side but some choose that little corner where they can sneak in front of you to cut you off.</text>

Huge Mcdonalds, enclosed playground, huge parking lot, small parking lots are endemic along the i10 out to Palm springs, so the lot size is worth noting.  Very close to the freeway<//review>

Cockroach Alert!! Last time I will eat there. The cashier added an extra meal that we did not order, when I tried to explain n get a refund since we already paid, this elderly lady came with an disrespectful attitude.  When our order came she told the other employee to take out the fries and db chs bgr "they don't want it" I was like "NO I didnt order it!" Guess what! I went to get my drink and there is a cockroach relaxing on its back in the fountain drain. I got the manager, she just look at it n went back to talking. WHAT! Bad service n bad customer service. They should learn to apologize for their mistakes.< /Text>

So we got down to eat inside (my car just got detailed) and there were to cashiers open people standing around and no real line. One libe for both? Well the cashier just said next and whoever went was served. The cashier was nice . We recived our food ot was good. However the place was hot. There were flies inside bumbs were getting free soda, a lady was eating food from home , the place was old and dirty. The kids did not care , and my moca was $3 less than starbucks so it was ok i guess. And they have play area for kids.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Horrible service. Horrible employees including the an expecially rude employee named "Roxy" who cursed at me and her fellow employees. She got my order wrong and even at one point questioned why I was there. Overall horrible experience. I suggest you fix it.< /Text>

Omg, this place never gets anything right. Never. If you don't want to go inside and you go through the drive thru make sure your stuff is in the bag BEFORE you leave or else they will forget something, they always do.<//text>

<text>I went to the drive thru of this mc donalds tonight and i only ordered a large sweet ice tea and 3 chocolate chip cookies the girl didnt do very well taking our order she had us repeat ourselves 4 times as we finally made it past the order taking we arrived at the 2nd window which was left half open we werent greeted, no eye contact was made she had us waiting for a while before she asked for our card, the bad service dosent end there im then asked to drive on to the red bars to wait for our order, 4 minutes later 2 cars have already been served and have driven past us. I was so tired and frustrated as it is i just drove off without ever receiving my order i already paid for. Now its just a simple late night craving but my money and time was easted during this annoying experience. My question is why am i being set aside to wait for 3 cookes and an ice tea and seeing customers passing me by?</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Very slow and not busy. I had ordered Mc Chicken and waited over 15 minutes for it. My total order was only 3 items iced tea,  oatmeal cookie  and Mc chicken. All other McDonald's this order would have been completed almost by the time I paid for it or with in a few minutes.< /text>

I mean, it's a McDonalds, but clearly one where the big money was put into the original build, and not much goes into staff or upkeep.  Large location, lots of TVs, and they bring the food to your table.  Unfortunately, the bathrooms have graffiti all over and show lots of wear, and the place is understaffed (broken ketchup dispenser, full trashcans, long waits to order / get food).

Skip this one and hit another exit instead.<//Text>
