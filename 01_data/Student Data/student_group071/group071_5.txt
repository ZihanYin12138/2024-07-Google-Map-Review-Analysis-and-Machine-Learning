Great coffee alternative to the bitter coffee served at the "green mermaid." Pastries are good quality, blueberry muffin and cheese danish. 4 stars because of order mix up and this location has run out of the seasonal items before.< /Text>

This is my first time here and I must say that the Mango Strawberry Green Tea is super Delicious. I live in Santa Clarita, CA and I have never been here. The only bad this is the wait as there was a long line to enter. I will come back here again.</Review>

The employees here were much more focused on their personal conversation than helping us customers. I didn’t even end up getting anything because no one took our order and the employees were just standing around and talking. We left and went to the location down the street on The Old Road and it was so much better!!! I would definitely recommend that one instead.</Review><username>Mia hines< /username>< user>

This coffee shop makes extremely sweet coffee, I thought it was an authentic coffee shop. My daughter went in and got two coffee drinks they were way too isweet.. She went back in and She had to insist on new drinks that we’re still just as sweet because they use a coffee powder to make their coffee very disappointing and the Barista was very rude< /text>

I love their coffee and tea!! Their coffee (hot, iced, or blended) doesn't have that burnt taste luke Starbucks usually has.
The quality is great and their rewards app is very easy to manage.
Their vibe is pretty low key and chill for studying too</text>

Didn't have cookies for cookies and cream asked if they could substitute coffee beans instead or in another drink. Was told I'd be up charged, doesn't seem right as it's not my fault you ran out of one item which can be not the same but a similar substitute. Expected more wasted 15 minutes just waiting as well

Last time I come to this location.< /text>

<review>It is pure convenience I go here for coffee.  This place is not as over rated as its competitors, so I figure it would be better guess I was wrong. They must be understaffed,  it takes too long to get a cup of coffee 10 minutes. The drivetru attendant doesn't repeat the order back. Having an additional  10 minutes to ask for correct order is luxury on a work morning.</review>< pics>

<review>The employees at this location are absolutely AWESOME!!!! I’m an app ordering person and don’t always know how to convey what it is I’m looking for through the app. I put a quick note just saying I wanted a 32 oz Matcha Green Tea Latte (sweet) and wasn’t sure what to add. When I got there and quickly received my drink the barista had made the most perfect and delicious drink!!!!! I think they just stole my heart from Starbucks lol....my son even loved it and he’s a super picky person...keep up the great service 🙂< /review>< rating>

The beautiful staff here is just as amazing as their delicious coffee. I can pull up in their drive through and not say a word and they say hey Frank, my dad, come on up and then hand me my drink that never changes. I love this place.< /text>

This location didn't know what a breve was when I ordered it, then they gave me a med when I ordered a large (twice, with the breve confusion) and the coffee was watery and bitter when I got it.   Literally the worst cup of coffee and worst service I've had at any coffee place.  The staff was very friendly so I did give an extra star for that.</text>

< review>
Edit: So I have always loved Coffee Bean. Always choose it over anywhere else. Unfortunately I went last week and ordered my normal iced drink and when I got the total, I had to ask what I ordered. It was 55 cents more than I had paid a few days prior. Now I understand price raises and such but this is a huge jump in price! $6.30 for a coffee drink is insane. I can go to other coffee places in town and get the same drink for a dollar less and it be delish too. Plus the whole mask wearing in the drive thru is just silly!

Fave coffee by far! Staff is always so amazing and I drive out of my way to find this shop! Highly recommend! I could live on Coffee Bean coffee! Mmmm so delish!</review>

<review>The drive-thru line took about 15 minutes to get through. They were out of several of the items that I wanted to get for my family (whipped cream for hot chocolate, croissants, mini bear claws). Who would have thought the coffee bean was a hip AF place?< /review>< Pics>

<text>So one day I decided to hang out here and play games on my phone(boredom) cause I showed up to work 2 hours early..... Don't ask ..... Anyways, I ordered a small chai tea latte, for here and a warmed cheese pastry thing(yummmmmmm)! These 2 delicious creations are a match made in heaven in my book :D. If you like sweet with a hint of spice and smooth with a little bite , this is it :) GO TRY ONE TODAY :)<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This place is never open. Vitality Bowls is open until 8pm. Would like to compare and see of they are a better option since they are closer to me. Maybe someday.<//Text>

In these parts, the main option is Vitality Bowls.  However while that's a decent option, I prefer Bowl Of Heaven.  My go-to order is a regular North Shore with 22g of added vanilla protein.  The Sea Sider and Sunset are good options, too.

Service is always fantastic, but parking can be crazy during peak times (don't forget to check around the corner, but those spots can be a little narrow).</Text>

Practically no acai in this $10 "acai" bowl. Tastes good, but bummed that I wanted stay and it was more strawberry banana.</Review>

<text>got the pitaya green and sunset something.... very very tasty!

taste really really good, however it's on the very very pricy side too. both drinks cost just under $18.

their most expensive acai bowl is just under thirteen dollars。< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< user_name>

THE BEST bowl of heaven in the Bay Area. They have amazing service and always make sure the customers are always satisfied with their order. I like this place more than its Mountain View counterpart.</review>

First time experiencing a bowl, it was wonderful and will be back soon.  I had the matcha bowl with honey granola strawberries and dark chocolate... yummy.  I'm gonna try the paradise bowl next.< /text>

It is basically a smoothie place and fresh fruit offerings. Expensive too.

Nice spot. Friendly service. The shopping area around it is nice too. Horrible parking. Best bet is to park close to the Target side and walk if you don't find any. The bowl options aren't as many as the one in La Verne or in Mountain View.< /review>

<Text>Visited twice just to check out how it compares to Vitality Bowls. Comparable bowl & smoothie offerings, but no savory options. Presentation is not as pretty, but it is a few dollars cheaper. Pay close attention to which ingredients are blended and which are toppings (i.e. strawberries blended, but chia seeds offered as a topping). Potential to be awesome if you specify exactly how you want your bowl prepared. Didn't work for me on auto pilot. Might give them another chance, but not certain.</Text>< Rate>

Great healthy refreshing desserts with exotic fruits. The only issue I have is that they should have to ask if you want a smoothie or bowl because the only difference between the two is ending the name with "blast".<//Text>

You have to come here with the correct mind set that you are paying for a meal, not a snack and assume you will be full from this...... each bowl is $10 + and the smoothies are expensive too. I thought I would save time and ordered take out from Yelp and paid $15.30 for a large smoothie last time! Oof! $15.30!!!!  I don't know that I can justify that all the time. As delicious as that Sunset Blast Smoothie was, I'm ok with my Jamba Juice. This is a place for me to treat myself.

That aside, if you are looking for those nice, tasty, fancy, healthy acai bowls, OR a delicious, unique smoothie, then you came to the right place. I can guarantee that it will taste good, but your wallet may be crying from it.< /Text>< username>

<review>Love stopping in here for a quick bite at 4am. It's so rare for anywhere to be open that early anymore but with its location right next to the highway going out of town it's a perfect place for us commuters to get something to start our morning off.< /review><response>None< /response>< rate>

Dough boy is a good name for this donut shop. Because the donuts are definatly doughy and not cooked all the way. I live less than 1/4 mile from there. And will drive the extra mile to Royal Jelly Donuts. Now they have fully cooked donuts that are delicious!<//Text>

<time>1490284569044< /time><Review>The best donuts in the Bay Area.  You have to go early on the weekend otherwise you'll find they're sold out.
Try their maple and bacon bars or their massive cinnamon rolls.  And you can't pass up their giant apple fritters.  They are awesome!
They also have filled donuts, with different fruit fillings or custard or my favorite a maple bar split down the middle with a big stream of custard.
They have also have coffees that beat Starbucks and Pete's.
Family run place for years.<//Review>< Rating>

It's more like a slice of "Cheer's"  which is calling it comfortable and friendly. Good place to catch a game plenty of screens from most seats.  They don't have a kitchen but will let you eat from pizza place next door while you watch the game so that's a plus due to the quality of that menu. Two for one stop!  Nice sports theme decor and they have a pool table as well! 👍👍</text>

<Text>The staff and general environment was cool. Everyone was polite. However, the patronage is sectoral. Lacks diversity, neighborhood watering hole.Time for an upgrade. Players is  (As discribed) a great neighborhood watering hole. It takes a visit or two for folks to relax with newcomers. However, once done it's a warm friendly spot with good sports little politics, good service and great pricing. It's one of my spots now. After further review. Its apparent that it just takes a couple of visits. To appreciate the warm atmosphere. It's a great place once everyone gets to relax w/each other. Service IS very good. However my review is limited to the day crowd.<//Text><Name>frederick<//Name>< Pics>

There was a heavy smell of cigarette smoke and the customers were very loud, swearing a lot, obnoxious and really drunk, and that was just the women, couldn't wait to get out. But the bartender was polite and friendly, good prices. Wish we could go back but there was too much loud vulgarity and drunken behavior, it chases customers away.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Great local dive! The staff and people are all so nice, the drinks are cheap, and you don't have to wait forever to get served. When it's slow, it's even good for reading a book or doing some work. Very chill little bar.</Review>

Drinks are cheap and tasty. They do not service the tables. You must fight your way through the crowded bar to get any kind of service. Maybe just an off day?</Text>

Plus you can order pizza by the slice (among other things) from Grumpy Tom's next door! I definitely recommend stopping by Players for a drink.<//review>< Pictures>

Great service from these guys. Reliable, prompt and have really great girls working for them. Our house was a hot mess when we moved in and they have really turned this around and have helped make this into a great home. Highly recommend you call Liz & Tony.<//Review>

Great service from these guys. We'd been let down by another service and called these guys up. The service was amazing and we've now booked up on them for a bi-weekly service.<//Review>

These guys are amazing. We really can't ask for a better service. They are reliable, prompt, and keep us updated of our next clean 2-3 days in advance by text and email. The girls that clean for us are really sweet too and we've always had the same team every 2 weeks.</text>

From the moment they answer the phone, to the estimate, to the clean itself, you feel you're truly valued not only as a client but you're treated almost like a friend or family member.
I cannot stress enough how great this company is. They're very responsive, you know exactly when the house cleaning team will be there, as you're text and emailed with an appointment time a few days before. The team we have do an absolutely amazing job, they're very considerate and I'd have no qualms in personally recommending them.
They're very transparent, open and honest. Since using You've Got Maids, I cant understand now why we put up with a second rate cleaning service with our previous service.< /Text>

We have just used this company for a deep clean, I think they call it a 52 point spring clean. Absolutely, amazing.
They're very transparent and stick to their word. My only criticism was they were running a little late but the traffic was really bad, so understandable, but they did keep us informed. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

< Review>
I called this company in a state of panic yesterday, having been let down by my regular cleaning company again. While they were unable to accommodate at such short notice, the owner of the business took my details and called  me back with 3 numbers of companies that may be able to help me out. By far the most helpful of all the companies I called that I thought they were deserving of a 5 star review for going out of their way to help.
It's no wonder they have such great reviews if this is anything to go by and I'm definitely going to call to book them for my weekly service.<//Review>

< Review>
Very happy with service these guys have done for us the past few months. They're very upfront and honest - we insisted on a 2 week clean but they believed with the amount of use we have in the property that an every 2 week service might be best. After a few weeks, they suggested reducing the service down, instead of wasting money.
The maids are amazing and friendly too.<//Review>

This crew dug me out of a hole the week before Christmas. Not only was the work amazing but the way in which the inquiry was handled and that they had the house cleaned in less time than they thought so they offered me a lesser rate,  which I refused as they worked so hard.
Highly recommend you call either Tony or Lizzie.</text>

I am really impressed with this company run by a really lovely British couple.
It's not just the reliabilty that has impressed us or the quality of the clean,  but the customer service is above any other cleaning service weve used and beyond our expectations too.
They email and text you a couple of days in advance of your clean and then after they've finished too. The team of maids that visit us are so friendly and efficient.
Really worth a call. I'm certainly glad we did.< /review>

There are cleaning services and then there are You've Got Maids.
Just simply phenomenal, from the way the inquiry is handled by Lizzie & Tony to the quote to the quality of the clean, the maids and even being kept informed a few days ahead of when our next clean is due. Proud to say we have these guys clean our home and office.</Text>

If you want a professional job done right,  then look no further, these guys are the best and I am very fussy.
We just used You've Got Maids for an emergency move out clean last week on our old home in Westlake Village after the independent firm we booked never returned our calls to confirm they were coming.
We then called You've Got Maids and from the get go, they have been absolutely amazing. Lizzie & Tony were very attentive and did exactly what they said they'd do. Their team did a fantastic job and helped take the stress out of moving  home. We most definitely recommend and have already booked them up for our new home.< /text>

I'm not usually one for writing reviews but we have been so impressed with the work You've Got Maids have done for us for a while. We run a handful of Airbnb's in Malibu and VC. These are by far the best cleaners we've used. We also have them clean our own home and my mother's home too. Absolutely amazing service from everyone we've dealt with there. They're not the cheapest but they are by far the best quality and most reliable.< /review>

Awesome service from these guys - run by a local British couple in the VC area. We originally went with their 52 point clean as we still had residual issues from the fires that our cleaners had not gotten a handle on.
We ended up calling these guys who have done such an amazing job that my husband said we have to have these guys weekly instead.<//Text>

<Review>I had heard a lot of positive vibes about You've Got Maids, so my wife and I called them up and spoke to Tony. It was Lizzie that came out for an estimate and she was very thorough. WE booked a 52 point clean iand we weren't disappointed - in fact, it was soooo good, we hired them for a weekly service.
We were extremely pleased with the results of our home. They made my kitchen shine and got it near spotless. Our oven I swear to God is almost as perfect as the day we bought it - well not quite as it gets some use but still WOW!
All the harsh water rings in the toilets that we get in this area due to the hard water were gone. Our bath is shiney and the grime is gone. All the dust is removed from everywhere. We had a 3 member crew so it was about 4 hours. The ladies were very courteous, friendly, thorough, and productive. I would definitely recommend them for a good clean home!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1580274436457, 'text': "Hi Gregg - thank you for your review.

I had my Chrysler at the Stealership over in Lake Elsinore and they kept it for almost 2 weeks and were not good at following up and charged me almost 2x what Menifee Transmission did for the same work. The Stealership was way to busy and I will not take any vehicle to them ever again if I can help it.  I had it towed and in one day, Menifee Transmission fixed what the Stealership couldn't fix in almost 2 weeks!  I was quoted over $1000 by the Stealership and Menifee Transmission charged just over $650 which is below the average what what I had done to my vehicle when I searched online.   There is reason why Menifee Transmission has a perfect 5 star rating on yelp! Great service and great value!</Review>

I have been going to Menifee Transmission for several years now for a few different vehicles. They have always taken care of my vehicles giving me pointers, best solutions for my budget and I always enjoy picking there brains! They go over and beyond with customer service sometimes even telling me "dont worry about it"!  Trustworthy mechanics!! They really care.< /review>

I took my 2010 dodge ram 1500 in for a check engine light diagnostic... The codes were all for sensors needed and I knew that and explained I needed the pressure sensor and torque converter clutch solenoid changed... They told me I needed a new transmission and it would cost 4000.00. If they would have done even a simple check they would have found that symptoms of the transmission issues were clearly caused by the bad sensors. I took my truck to another shop and they diagnosed and changed sensors for 830.00, my truck runs perfectly and the check engine light is off now. The reason why I am posting this is to warn people that might not know any better and would shell out hard earned money for a new transmission just on the word of a unscrupulous mechanic< /Text>

I wanted him to have a reliable vehicle.so I told him, bring your car in for full service, being it had 100k miles, that way, he had a base line of service.

Changed:
1. Replaced belts
2. Replaced  and drain power steering fluid
3. Replaced  and drain brake fluids
4. Replaced  transmission fluid
5. Replaced  and flush radiator fluid
6. Replaced  rear end gear oil.

Joe ,was so understanding and helpful he offered to replace the oil pressure sending unit for free, the next time we come in.

It nice to find a business that's HONEST and local, that my grandson can take his car, without being ripped off.<//review>< Date>

<review>I came here to have my transmission checked out hoping I would get an honest mechanic that could be upfront about any work my car needs. Well Joe didn't fail me at all. I told him my concerns and he had my car looked at and came back with telling me my car was fine, no well it could be this but it'll cost you talk just the truth and if I had any other concerns to bring it back to have him check it out. That's exactly the kind of guy I would recommend anyone to. I didn't mind paying him the fee to find nothing wrong with my car or settled my nerves and he still was doing his job. Thanks Joe!</review>< pics>

This is the auto shop you want to go to, I have been to many autoshops and this has been the,most reliable, honest, and fairest on price.
I take my,vehicles here all the,time for anything.
I always recommend and refer people to get their car done here.
Customer service is always great and they do do much more than just the job description.</Text>

Didn't get work on car done there. Total lack of communication. They insisted we didn't call first. We did. Of the three conversations with them. They never thought to mention that they booked up for no less than a week. Not until the discussion about them saying we didn't call about bringing the car in. Then the attitude showed up. In response to this post I was reamed. They turned everything around so they looked as if their halo was bright and shiny. Whatever business they did in the past with my husband had nothing to do with me. I was not hostile I was irritated. When we came in the office I saw no friendly faces with smiles. I got attitude the moment I walked in the door. I was dealing with a situation that arose between the shop and my husband. They were rude and downright hostile. I would not take a plastic bag for them to work on. How do you keep customers with that Sanctimonious attitude?

I always wanted to respond to your post.
Though I decided that arguing online wasn't going to fix anything.< /Text>

{'time': 1550865311296, 'text': "We apologize, however, we refused service to you because when you came in your were extremely confrontational and hostile from the very beginning.  It was not a lack of communication or attitude on our side. You walked in and demanded that an excessive amount of work be done on your vehicle in an amount of time that would not have been possible.  When we tried to explain this, you did not want to hear it and continued with your hostility.\nNormally, customers will call and ask for a time window if they need numerous repairs. If they do walk in and we inform them that we cannot get it done within the time window they need, then they will happily set an appointment that works best for their schedule.  Our customers understand that we take our time to make sure all of the work is done properly.\nYou came in and spoke directly with the owner and instead of understanding that auto repair takes time for quality and safe work, you began to degrade and speak horribly.  We have worked on your husband's car numerous times and have always helped him out to the best of our ability because of financial issues.  We did not deserve to be treated to or spoken to the way you did.  We kindly ask that you and your husband no longer bring your vehicles to our facility.  We will not be verbally abused and attacked simply because we do not rush our work."}< /response>

I went into the shop to get the service records on a car I bought. I was told all records were wiped clean in November 2017 by accident.  Next I went on carfax, guess what- Menifee Transmission never reports to car fax.  How do you not spend  $20 on a flash drive to keep a copy of your records safe? Find a shop with better business practices.< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1549069078331, 'text': "Unfortunately, our hard drive was wiped and we have since made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again, and it is not as simple and cheap as a $20 flash drive, our database is much more complicated then that.  However, I would like to mention that auto repair shops have never been required to report to Carfax.  From a quick look at Carfax's website it seems that auto repair facilities can pay a premium to Carfax and become an authorized shop, these shops more then likely, report the maintenance.  Reporting to Carfax is not required or mandatory, it is only an advertising option for auto repair facilities to get exposure and customers.  I would also like to add, when buying a used vehicle you should request copies of all service records from the seller and if they cannot provide them then you ask them to obtain such records prior to the purchase.  Used vehicles are normally buyer beware and sold as is. Also, even if our system had not been damaged, we would not have provided those records to you unless we had permission from the individual who owned the car previously, otherwise it is a violation of privacy.  I hope you have a good day."}<//Resp><Rating>1</Rating>< user_name>

I had a simple oil change service. When I went back home I found most of the oil was spelled on my garage floor. Went back next day with new oil and talked with Joe. He add 2 more quarters of oil and refuse to refund me for the purchased I made. He cursed me and kicked me out of his business. I filed a complain against his shop. so soon he will be out of business. All these good reviews you read from his family and friends. BE CAREFUL</text>

Yes, you were kicked out of our shop because you continued to attack the owner.  You have simply copy and pasted all of your reviews and then scoured internet to post them where ever you can.

Easy and convent Poke Bowls. Everything tastes fresh and there is lots of variability so it’s never boring. The customer service could be more friendly. The menu also needs the nutritional information posted, they have 3 locations after all and they need to have that info available. Otherwise, a nice and clean establishment.<//Text>

I also like the food. And for some reason the shrimp doesn’t always taste right. The customer service is always interesting each time I come here. Sometimes the workers are always amazing- cheerful, they listen, and make the overall experience delightful. Then sometimes the workers are eh- bored, gloomy, hate their job. I understand humans can’t always be happy, but I like the happy workers better, it just makes the experience better.</Review><date>1572485185314</date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmBfwDs_0xXvKAqtWrcyiBERZDzKwWOisvVHNc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnUzBfhawbQtBALnfuuo069KSj2yqqR3y018Dm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4lG5vmIbDq9ZUlBAHcvh2AL3Aftu0wxC9GWqn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Rating>

Fresh, uniquely simple and delicious.  If you are looking for a healthy quick meal, you have got to try Butterfish ! I am not a fish lover, so I get the chinese chicken salad.  My husband LOVES fish, so it's his favorite place to stop for a quick meal. Don't forget to try the Pokemole and wonton strips.... SO GOOD !<//Text>

<review>I love Butterfish! Great fresh tasting fish, lots of different vegetables and sauces to add to your bowl. They go above and beyond with the toppings with things such as kimchee carrots, curried cauliflower and fried shallots. Today I found a new love at Butterfish...their tempura maitake mushrooms! Super tasty, crunchy and fried to perfection.<//review><rate>5< /rate>< Time>

I'm a huge fan of the Spicy Sriracha Shrimp bowl here. I don't know if it's a location only special, but it's bomb. Other than that, I like the variety of fish, meat, and toppings available for poke bowls. I appreciate that there is beef and chicken available for folks who don't like raw fish. Plus the staff has always been really helpful and friendly.</review>

So I went to Butterfish for the first time today. Let me tell you customer service was off the hook. These kids have great service. I recommend this place especially during covid that seems most people hold back. Food was great.  We ordered a side of tempura shrimp mmmmmm wowsers!! Atmosphere was great as well. We will be going back.< /Text>

<review>What champions! During covid I feel like so many businesses are dealing with being busier than they usually are - and with door dash and other online difficulties there seemed to be a lot of angry customers. Despite the fact I ordered online to the wrong location, the young lady at the window at this location quickly remedied the situation as well as ensuring my refund for the incorrect order. She was incredibly kind in the face of impatient and annoyed customers, and dealt with the situation with such grace and good humor. After working at Starbucks for years I know how hard rude people can be. Thank you so much for quickly fixing the order despite how busy it was. Well worth the wait!!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Very modern atmosphere. The food is fresh and delicious, I tend to stop at this restaurant when I am on this side of town.  The only reason for four stars is that the customer service can be a hit or a miss at this place. Sometimes you'll get super friendly faces with a hi, hows it going or what can i get started for you...other times its 'what do you want?'< /Review><Response>None< /Response><Date>1566316136529</Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

Surprised me! Have been searching for a good poke bowl in Fresno and this place lets me create my own?! The tuna is actually fresh! Really surprised me. Friendly staff you guys are rocking it.
Only issue is I had to drive across town so you guys should open a location near downtown.
Good stuff!<//text>

I had never had poke before but I thought "What the hell, why not" because it looked so good and was super healthy. Let me tell you, it was PHENOMENAL!!! So fresh and the flavors were incredible. The staff there helped walk me through the entire process, and I came up with my perfect bowl. It was so good I came back the next day for lunch. Thank you ButterFish on Palm!

Delicious fresh food with great quality ingredients. It tastes great and I really liked the many options you can go with in your bowl. They have a large menu and they have great customer service. It is located in a great comedian place and this site is brand new. Make sure you try their seared ahi tuna and the ingredients are absolutely great. Everything just tastes so damn good 😬<//text>

<rating>1</rating><pictures>None</pictures><review>The food was great, however the owner of this location thought that it wasn't important to put a changing station in any of their bathrooms at their restaurant, so when I had to change my baby I went up to the counter because I didn't know where to do it, the manager called the owner and THE OWNER said that I needed to change my baby outside in my car or ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR! We live in Fresno! The temperature on Monday next week will be 105 degrees, and I'm supposed to go out and change him in my car after I've been eating in a restaurant for 30 minutes?!? I've never been so appalled by a restaurant OWNER before, this was so ridiculous I just couldn't believe it, so I changed my babies diaper on a table in their dinning area to hopefully get the point across about just how not ok it is to leave parents of small children with no options, I sure hope that the rest of the people in the dinning room were just as appalled as I was, especially when seeing human waste changed on a table they may eat at in the future, I certainly hope other locations are better than this one! Despite the food being delicious, I will not be back until they make proper accommodations!< /review>< Date>

I adore butterfish. I always order online right before my 11:30-9:30 shift starts. The bowls are filling enough to be lunch and diner for me. They always get my bowl spot on every time. The atmosphere is very chill and welcoming, the bowls are super filling, and super fresh! Keep up the good work, you're all amazing!</review>

Food is yummy BUT service was awful.
Some of the girls were extremely rude and very short responses. The man who rang us up tossed our card back at us too. Possibly the manager??
My friend also got overcharged for a bowl that had no add ons. She pays less on doordash than in-store<//review>

They went a little overboard with the seaweed and Spicy Mayo. I think the guy must have worked at pokeland.</text>

First time here, was definitely NOT a disappointment. ALL fresh ingredients and fast friendly service. I had the Sriracha Shrimp with white rice, jalapeños and habaneros, masago, and avocado.
Fire🔥🔥
Will definitely recommend to others and will return.</review>

< Review>
The food was awful ask for recommendations from the workers and theyre like "i got you" im thinking to myself hopefully these employees get my food right, which they didnt. I never rate places because im not a food critic, but when after taking a first bite i literally wanted to throw it away. Disappointed. Fake Chipotle sushi style restaurant sucks!< /Review>

Great neighborhood joint

Great service

Good people

Forget parking take an Uber or walk here you'll have more fun that way.

Has record store inside.

Great place for live music showcasing small independent musical acts.

Good selection of beer and liquors.

Giant Patio out back

Great place to hang out late after all the restaurants have closed in downtown San Pedro.

A true must see.

Has food offerings on the patio

I always have a good time Everytime I visit.<//Text>

< Review>
XMAS LOCAL COMMAND CENTER
KINGDOM OF MR. T
AKULA CLASS
The fine service and favorite beer still makes the Sardine Xmas favorite choice! Locals from other bars, tavern and lounges within San Pedro that are gone are massing at this location! Special thanks to the Master Mixologist extending my stay and the fine lady I just met so her and I could continue our conversation! I had a really good time and the beer was absolutely #1 in this region! Glad to have made your acquaintance  Madam Jasmine! Requesting you escort me to Bamboo Palace in your district for additional reviews on the outer rim!  Otherwise see you next Sunday!< /Review>

Great punk/rock bar in the South Bay/Harbor Area. Nice to not have to go to LA or Long Beach. Thankfully, they've been able to stay open during these times. 🙌</text>

Really fun. So great to have another live music option. Saw Mike Watt and the Secondmen. Amazing of course. Just a super cool experience. And I could walk from home if I wasn't so lazy. Perfect!!< /Review>

Nice for a chain restaurant. Not fancy, but a good sit-down place. This branch is more relaxed and generally above the standard for the chain, which is fine. The staff were really nice.
The mall it's in has (by regional standards) great parking.</Text>

Food was pretty good. Had lunch. Mexican salad and cheese quesadilla. The salad was super tasty. And especially loved the dressing. Service was fair. The room we were in desperately needed a makeover, hence the four star.< /Text>

Today was my first time eating at this location and I will say I was a disappointed in the service . First off our server was quick to take our drink order but after that it became slow . My chicken tortilla soup had no chicken :-( Secondly ,  we had to constantly keep an eye out for our waitress in order to ask for anything and when we did it took about 20 minutes to receive it . Lastly, when we decided we wanted to pay , we had to wait 25/30 minutes to pay . It was not crowded at all yet the service wasn’t what it should be . The entree we received were hot so that’s why I came them an additional star. I felt as though I had to serve myself . If we needed refills we had to play hide and seek with our server. She rarely came to check on how we were doing . Lastly , as we went to pay check finally they overcharged me and then tried to fix it by paying another groups check. I am shocked that a manager would allow such bad service to be okay.Overall, I would not recommend this location to eat at unless you have 3 hours to eat food.<//text>

Worse service I have ever had.  Took 10 minutes for the waitress to take a drink order.  I ordered a 3 Combo meal. 2 cheese enchiladas and a taco.  Don't know where the cheese was, enchiladas where flat. Putting cheese on the top doesn't make it a cheese enchilada. Girlfriends fahitas never showed up by the time I talked to the manager 10 minutes later.  She wanted to explain something to me with a half full restaurant. Instead of offering to correct the situation she said fine and walked off in a huff. Poor service and the manager needs to be trained on customer service and how to talk and act with customers who aren't happy.<//text>

No-one at the reception desk, had to go looking for an employee so we could be seated.
Our server was very nice.
Chips were stale and the salsa tasted like spicy pizza sauce.
Main dish was good and came out quickly.
All in all, not bad but not great either.< /text>

<Review>My boyfriend and I went for a late diner after a long day at work. We arrived at about 10:40 and were complately ignored! At exactly 11:01 a server came over to us and told us they were closed. I was so upset I just walked out. Food is usually pretty good but we will NOT be going back to this location. Please hire people who understand what customer service is. If half a star was a rating, that's what I would give it.< /Review>< pictures>

****Attention Attention Attention*****
Management and Employees get off your butts and clean up the Floor, Tables and Outside eating area.
Went there yesterday 9/23/17 about mid afternoon and was very displease on how this placed is maintained. Even the door leading to the outside eating area was not operating properly.
Food was ok but employees need a pep talk. AC was cold has hell inside Bar area to the point most folks were eating outside where tables and the floor were not clean from previous guest< /review>

< Review>
We use to go multiple times a month to the Sunday brunch Buffett. Now we rarely go because they raised the price another two dollars to $16.99 per person. Well we didn't come back for nearly 6 months and I just went this morning for my birthday and found out they raised the price to $18.99 per person. After tax that's nearly $21 per person for some average food. On top of that everytime we come back the selection is less and less and many items are out. Many items under or over cooked.

Overall we have decided to never come back because the $70 meal for my wife, daughter and I was barely worth $30. I would have got more bang for my buck from the Denny's across the street.</Review>

We ordered doubles and instead of getting double the alcohol in our drinks the bartender just have us our drinks in tall glasses. Our server knew that was not what we wanted but still bright then to us and pretty much just shrugged it off with an insincere apology.
We also ordered a few appetizers. The queso carnitas dip was awful! The cheese tasted like cheese whiz.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>BIRTHDAY MONTH=BIRTHDAY COUPONS=HAPPY RODNEY

Free entree (up to $12.99) for email club members

Seeing how the El Torito in Cerritos closed down, the next closest location to me is at the Long Beach Town Centre.  Eagerly awaiting redeeming my birthday month email, I hopped on the freeway, turned on the first exit, and parked in the front of TGI Friday's.  A leisurely stroll in front of Edwards Cinema, and I found myself at El Torito.

Being the first customer of the day, I found myself salsa/cumbia/bachata dancing to the rousing music while waiting to be seated.  A gentleman led me to the 10 person booths by the windows, facing Chik-Fil-A & In N' Out.  Being 1 person in a 10 person booth made me feel like "El Jefe".

Complimentary chips & salsa started my lunch.  The salsa had some heat to it, but not enough to put off those that can't handle spicy.

Grilled chicken taco salad-
Romain lettuce, grilled chicken, refried beans, cotija cheese, roasted pepitas, crisp tortilla strips, pico de gallo,   guacamole, sour cream & avocado dressing (on the side) in a large taco shell.  Huge portions in an oversized plate, the taco salad did not fail to impress.  The cubed chicken was tender, the guac & sour cream smooth, and the romaine crisp.  What helped add more substance to the dish were the refried beans underneath.  After a little mixing, along with a slathering of the avocado dressing, the grilled chicken taco salad proved quite the behemoth.  But, alas, it was no match for "El luchador gordo"!!  I stayed away from the taco shell, being I already had tortilla chips with salsa.

Service was excellent!  My attendant worked at the Cerritos location and a few other local El Toritos, previously.  He came by with more salsa and checked frequently to see if I needed anything.  He also refilled my soda water & lime 3 times, 1 for me to take home.  Seating is via tables & booths of varying sizes.  The cantina, with a more intimate dining area, is directly left of the entrance.  The main dining area is behind the entrance.  Being seated by the windows, I had plenty of indirect light around me as I ate.  Having a great complimentary lunch, enjoying a gorgeous day in SoCal, and I was a happy camper!

Parking is at the Long Beach Town Centre.  El Torito is located in the Promenade, with the closest parking being near Chik-Fil-A & In N' Out.

Whew, I am stuffed!  El Torito's grilled chicken taco salad was a hefty meal, all the more better being free when I showed my free birthday month email on my phone.  Service was top-notch, as I was attended to frequently.  Considering all that, plus a clean, cozy dining area & some killer music to rock out to, El Torito at the Long Beach Town Centre comes highly recommended by your's truly.

<user_name>Victoria Rodriguez</user_name><Review>When they 1st opened I paid $15 per visit & the female Vet was good.  Now its still affordable but it's $45 & the vet was a Male who I had trouble understanding.  I went for my dog's ear & you can't go inside with your pet.  The doctor tried to charge me to treat a supposed terrible rash on her stomach,  but I declined until I could see it. There was no rash to speak of,  he wanted $120 for  a shot, plus another $29 for antibiotics for the invisible rash. I only paid for the ear medication & wash. I won't be going back. Total RIP Off!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

We took our 7 months old kitten in for a Physical Exam.  Because of Covid 19, we cannot go in with her.  I was very concerned the way they handle the crate at the beginning.  All I can say is that they did not handle it with care.  My kitten was all shaken up when we got her back.  She did not make a sound all the way home and sat in the corner of the crate shaking !!   It broke our hearts to see our kitten like that. When we arrived home, she wants everyone to hold her.
In the report, they said my kitten was difficult to handle and was trying to bite!   I am sure many of you loving pet owners can relate, although our pets can't speak, but they can communicate to us when something ain't right.   I cannot recommend this place to any pet owner.< /text>

Took in my kitty, Eva, today and they were awesome.
Loved that they respect covid guidelines to keep their customers safe. My Eva went home better and happy.< /Text>

<Review>I am so grateful to have a vet like Thrive! All the doctors have been great and caring to my Buddy but most importantly are the hard working techs they have. He was diagnosed with Diabetes and Cushings, so I am a frequent customer. Every time I am there, the techs show true compassion and provide excellent customer service. I trust them completely with him! Thank you all for taking such good care of my Buddy!<//Review>< Pics>

We have been going to Thrive Affordable Vet care for the last 3 1/2 years and every visit we are always so satisfied.
My Dog had some scabbing on his head and we had no idea what it was, you guys took care of it in the best way possible. It was a mystery for us all, but I trusted you guys and I am glad I did and still can!
He has had some stuff going on with his right ear due to allergies the last few months and again that was well taking care of. Today is 08/18/2020 and he just got neutered. While he was there they checked his ear and found some stuff and gave me a call to confirm if they can take care of it! I appreciate you guys for calling and letting me know my options before doing a cleaning without knowing and charging me like other vets do. His appointment originally was in October to get neutered, they had an opening and got him in ASAP!
Again nothing but positive experiences every visit! Thank you guys for always taking care of Milo, and being honest!<//text>

<Text>Their staff is very nice and appointment is very convenient.  During the epidemic, you need to call the veterinarian to communicate, pets go in, and the owners wait outside.  After joining a member, there is no need to pay for medical visits, but prescription drugs are more expensive.</Text>< Rating>

<review>I am very impressed with this office. I have had a hard time finding an affordable and caring vet after moving out here to the IE. Good veterinarians are hard to find these days. Most try to push more services than are necessary and/or seem to lack compassion. My dog and I were both lucky enough to stumble upon Thrive. Our experience was pleasant from the moment we were greeted at the front desk until we walked out the door to leave. The Veterinarian was kind, thorough and straight to the point. She did not try to sell us unnecessary services or products. The issue that my dog has can easily run up into thousands IF you are unexperienced and unaware of your options. This Dr was very honest and up front about what was needed and what was not necessary. All of the staff was very patient, kind and friendly. Prices are definitely more affordable than other veterinarian's offices that I've been to. Overall, I highly recommend this place. We will be returning here for any and all future medical needs :)< /review><Pics>None</Pics><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Greetings I took my dog Reggie in yesterday to have a number of services done and I am grateful for the good attitudes you guys had however whomever "trimed" his nails did a SLOPPY job. You told me you had to sedate him in order to do your job yet it was a sloppy one. Poorly done. None of you mentioned this to me.. I only noticed when I looked closely at his nails. Seriously? "Medical grooming nail trim". A botched job. I'm disappointed. I don't care if your team had a busy day, you sedated him for a reason and still did a bad job.</review>< pictures>

<Date>1572431185915<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>We brought our dog into the office after she had a head injury from her and another one of our bigger dogs playing. She had all the signs of a concussion and we called Thrive and they said to bring her in asap. We did, we arrived and our dog started throwing up, staggering in her walk and was very out of it. The vet took a look and confirmed a concussion and neck injury and prescribed pain killers and also found a ear infection. We decided to take care of the infection right then and there. She also recommended we leave her with her for an hour for observation to make sure no significant damage was done to her. An hour and a half later we get the all clear and was told everything was good and she would be perfectly fine. She came home and within a few hours we found her laying on the ground unresponsive and panting heavily. We called but they were closed, we were panicked and called an ER for dogs and was told that we needed to bring her in asap. Before we could pack her up she had 2 seizures in our arms and what seemed like a heart attack and died traumatically. We were devastated... We were told hours prior she was gonna be perfectly fine and then she died a horrible painful death. I believe this vet did us a huge disservice. We called other clinics and every single one said they would have done an MRI due to the breed of the dog and the description of her symptoms. They unanimously agreed that the vet at Thrive did not do the correct thing and because of that our dog of 10 years suffered greatly before she passed. I would avoid this Thrive at all costs.. they wouldn't even refund us the unused medications we purchased less than 24 hours prior and had the audacity to send us a letter giving us their condolences. These people are heartless and incompetent. I just hope that with this review maybe someone can avoid the heartache and loss we went through at the hands of these people.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1572438411920, 'text': 'Dear Western, thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Excellent Care, Great Vet! We took our cat here as a walk-in this morning and the staff could not have been more helpful. They were amazing, we're very happy with how they treated our little kitty cat. We're having blood tests done, and everything is laid out simply and clearly. No pressure and no hidden costs.<//Text>

False advertising. Rude and will say it's because of covid. You get lied to called not two hours before your appointment to say they are not doing the service even though not one of the spam emails stated nor does ANY of the non authorized emails and texts. You will be asked to calm down not giving names not called back and treated so unkind. Lied stated they are not apart of BBB and are. There's no manager on duty you can't get a corporate phone number you're told to look it up yourself and hung up on this was at the Santa Ana location in Santa Ana California still no call back steal my appointment got canceled because of the negligence of your center-steele I have left the complaints and was lied to still do not take your pet here</text>

Great people and super cheap visits with highly qualified vets. Because it's affordable it always takes a week or longer to get in to see the vet. Also medication prices are a bit high, ask for the prescription when possible and fill it at Costco.<//Text>

Called to inquire about a service and the woman on the phone was very confused, every time I asked a question, she would repeat the question as if she didn’t understand, then was not able to provide any information regarding services. When I asked what the vets name was, she didn’t know. Not sure how reliable this place is. Will not be calling back. Also it seemed as if the lady on the phone was in her kitchen and it sounded like some dishes were falling on the floor. 🤷‍♀️<//Review>

<Review>I would recommend this place to anyone.  They were very pleasant and efficient.  I brought my Papillion here to be neutered.  I was very nervous cause he’s just a little guy. So I made the appointment to get his shot and see if I felt comfortable enough to have him neutered there.  Dr Humphrey was great, she took so much time with him and did a very through exam.  There was no rushing.
So I had him neutered there and glad I did!!!  They called me after his surgery to let me know he was done and doing well.  He has recovered so well😄❤️<//Review></record></dataset><record>

There hasn’t been a long wait the two times I’ve been in and the Vet does not rush you through the visit. We have had great experiences both visits.</text><rating>5<//rating>< resp>

My names shawna harrison today I took my lovely baby 🐈 🐱 Sativa Mili into this place for her doctors apmnt and I must say I love this place and the staff. They are very knowledgeable and great with animals. They did a good job on cleaning her ears and her teeth 🦷. I love my car so much and she’s been in a little bit of pain for a while I’m happy to have an insurance plan with them for her so she gets all the proper  care she needs. We were referred by a good friend of mine! This place is attached to a petco witch is so essential and great for any last minute pick ups! I would definitely recommend taking your lovely fire baby here. Just follow their instructions on procedure follow up and you will be fine! If you love your pet your pet will love you! NOTHING bad about this place! FAST RELIABLE & AFFORDABLE. Thank you to all the staff and thrive vet associates who took the time to fully analyze my cat and tell me what she needs for the future! I will always be returning and use your services for a monthly or as needed ear clean, flush, & teeth cleansing or polish treatment. Totally affordable and worth every cent! Will definitely take up offers in the future for her health. The vet technician 👩‍🔧 and doctor 👩‍⚕️ were very educated and cared about her very much. Sativa was very calm and comfortable! Thank you guys for being open during such hard tragic times. We love you guys already!!! A+ 100% 💙💙💙💙🙏🙏🙏🙏🥰🥰🥰🥰🐈🐈🐱👩‍⚕️👩‍🔧❣️❣️❣️🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾< /Text>

< Review>
All the bad reviews I read are from people wanting to treat this place like an emergency clinic. Its not. This is a regular vets office, if they're booked they will tell you. I have brought 3 dog to see them. Two had appointments. One I called in to see if they could see her because I thought she had a fox tail in her ear. They said yes bring her in, we will look at her between appointments. I dropped her off at 10am and by 10:45 they called to tell me she did have 2 fox tails and asked if I wanted to do the surgery to remove them. I of course said yes, She was read to be picked up by 12:30. This is an AMAZING vets office with a fantastic, caring staff. If I could give more stars I would!< /Review>

You need a restroom. It’s horrible to have to have to go somewhere else to relieve yourself. We come from out of town and didn’t realize we could not use Petco’s restroom cause it wasn’t open. It’s number one very embarrassing to have to go in another store to ask to use the facilities... it’s for customers only so
then you need to purchase something. There should be some adjustments made😐
On top of it after I asked the receptionist about a place to go... five minutes later she walked into Petco and went... really?<//Review>

Visited to get our kitten checked out, he seemed off from his normal self. Vet couldn’t tell us anything that could be wrong with him besides giving him vaccinations and medicine to give him, told us he’d be fine. Fast forward to two weeks later he was found by my wife suddenly passed away.  Won’t be taking any of our other animals here.<//text>

<Text>I called to get information about spaying my dog.  They will not give info over the phone. They stated it is "base" price of $250. When i asked what that included i was told i would need to book a $25 consultation to find out and talk to the Dr. to see what is included! Seriously? No thanks!</Text>< pics>

A sad day for me with my sick kitty but everyone there was super sweet and the dr. helped me understand everything. She even made it a point to help me keep the cost down. I’ll be going here from now on.
UPDATE!!!
I didn’t think it could get any better than it did, but it did. I would give them 10 stars if I could. Never have I received such a sweet condolence card, it made me cry. Thank you again to everyone at Thrive!< /text>

The best care my pet ever had.  I was worried  because my pet is extremely hipper (Chihuahua) and doesn't let anyone near him.  The veterinarian and the technicians were very kind and gentle with him.  I loved this place and highly recommended it .< /Review>

<Review>The receptionist named Cat at this place of business called Thrive in Petco should be fired immediately for lack of caring about animals.
We have brought our dog here on two occasions for carprofen.  She is 13 years old and can hardly walk. Carprofen has made a big difference in her life which was prescribed to her by a veterinarian in Long Beach. We came to this clinic in order to have her carprofen continually prescribed. All of a sudden we don't get it in the mail from chewy because they canceled her RX.  We call the office and tell them she's been out of it for 4 days and can hardly walk.  They said we could bring her in in a week.  She is 13 years old and does not tolerate being with other people if we are not there. Car profen has made a big difference in her life which was the prescribed to her by a veterinarian in Long Beach.  All the sudden we don't get it in the mail from Chewie so we call the office and tell them she's been out of it for 4 days and can hardly walk. They said we could bring her in in a week which we said was fine if we could have enuf meds for 1 week.  That was a NO.
They asked if we could drop her off and leave her there on Monday.   husband was fed up and we had enough. He said we would take her to another clinic.  These people are supposed to care about animals and I mostly blame the receptionist.  Veterinary hospital across the parking lot gave us an appointment for 2 hours later.  That is the kind of service that my dog deserves and that we want for our pet.</Review>< gmapID>

Would give 10 stars if I could! Took cat with severe allergies and was totally amazed by every one employed at THRIVE. Professional, great attitudes to say nothing of how surprised I was that Dr. Humphrey actually worked to save me money. Compared to other office visits with three veterinarians in Temecula my bill was half what previously paid even with a blood panel. I will return that's for sure!!< /review>

I took in our mama pup. She was found dumped on the streets and ended up being pregnant. A week after having her puppies she was screaming in pain so i rushed her to the vet where she co rubies to scream in the waiting room. They told me they were booked but she could wait in the back to be seen in between clients. FIVE hours later they finally see her after i kept calling and told me everything looks good she is happy and laying on her back, i told the dr that is NOT normal for her and she said it is visible she is in pain so suggested some pain meds... i picked her up and she is throwing up in the parking lot still screaming so i take her to another vet to find out she still has the placenta and deceased puppies inside her. So she had to have emergency surgery in fear of sepsis. Needless to say she was not far from dying. While Thrive couldn’t be bothered to do a true exam and listen to what i was telling them about my own dog! If i didn’t follow my gut instincts i could not have my dog right now. Sadly i will never trust Thrive with my animals again. I should not be having to demand more be done for my dogs health when something is very clearly wrong! Especially with a mama dog that has 1 week old puppies needing her.<//review>

<user_name>Debi Chimommie< /user_name><Review>Beware of the walk ins welcome policy. I tried 3 times to call during business hours and their phone system either wasn't working or they kept hanging up. I went in as a walk in only to find out they were doing surgeries. They said I could leave her and come back. I offered to walk around the store as long as it would take. They would not let me so that. I'm not leaving my little girl in a cage just to see a vet. I didn't demand to see a vet ASAP but they wouldn't let me wait in the store with her to be seen.<//Review><rate>1<//rate></record>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Used this place multiple times for a few of my pets, I've spent a fair amount $$$ here let me say. Called to make an appointment to see about having my Male American Bully fixed. Told me I needed a consolation then would need to come back again, why? and the price would be $250.00 so I thought to myself why is this as much as it was for my female? So we showed up for our appointment time to find that the rude girl who took our call never booked us. So we stood there for 45 mins waiting, to be told oh that price is wrong its $300.00 now. So I asked the lady why is it more than it was to fix my female 1yr ago? And I got a shoulder shrug...like not sure and dont care. It's really insulting and we are told to be responsible and fix our pets...but come on! Make it atleast reasonable. Crooks theres no other word for it. I found a place close $90.00 and no consolation to clip 2 nuts.<//Review>< user>

For the longest time, I felt like vets were taking advantage of my love for my dog, knowing I’d do anything for my boy. I decided to give Thrive in Menifee a chance. I finally felt like I found a vet and staff who truly want what’s best for my dog, instead of what’s best for their bank account. Their exam fee is so affordable! They go over all the costs before doing anything. I LOVE that you can call the vet, which I had to leave a message, but she actually called me back within an hour and took the time to talk about a solution for my pet’s issue. I highly recommend Thrive in Menifee. Ask for Nicole, she’s the best!</text>

I took Avi there for an abscess.
Not only was doctor Siegler amazing friendly and actually took her time with us but the did what California Vet specialist could not do.
That was find the cause of the pain and fix it! And the price!!! Omg awesome!
Thank you Avi and I< /Review>

Dont be fooled by the nice new look of this place, they obviously lack any compassion or real love for animals! Utterly Disappointed and Saddened by these people. Dont go as a walk in or as an Urgent  client. Just finished walking our puppy and discovered a gigantic Grey tick on our girl, got it out as best we could, but still felt there was something inside- as we all know, this can be Life changing for both Human and Animal. This 'Veterinarian' couldn't be bothered to check her...because they wanted to close EARLY! Are you kidding me???!!!!</Text>

Yummmmmmmmmmy! One of the best ramen restaurants in LA for real. The dipping noodles were delicious in the broth. The spring egg’s got a great texture and melts in my mouth. The pork fat melts in my mouth as well. Oh my god. So good. 5 stars 100%</Text>

The silky ramen was amazing! You can definitely taste the texture AND flavor difference between it and the default tonkotsu. (I'm not a vegetarian so I tried both, and both were good in their own ways.) Super recommend.< /review>

< Review>
They are known for their dipping ramen. Their menu is concise and easy to pick from. The service is great and the food was prepared quickly. They have outdoor sittings available.

-1 star because they didn't follow any protocol of taking temperature or hand sanitization. When you pay with cards, you still have to sign on their touchscreen devices (making it unsanitary as they don't clean it after each use).  -1 because I don't think there's anything unique about this place. The flavor is average, the noodle is standard, and overall, sitting right on the benchmark.

Expect to pay between $18-25 per person. I'll be trying nearby restaurants first before considering returning.<//Review>

Did some research before coming here and decided to come to this location vs their annex location across the street.  Haven't had the annex location yet but very glad that we chose this one!  First off, can I just say that I appreciate a ramen shop that understands my late night ramen cravings and so they're open late?  We came here for second dinner at midnight and pretty much had the shop to ourselves.

Food:
I am a huge tsukemen fan so when I heard this place is known for their dipping ramen then I had to try it.  I immediately picked the cha siu tsukemen since it comes with the most food :P   The noodles were a great level of firmness, the chashu pork for tender, and the broth.... the broth was absolutely awesome and reminded me of some ramen shops I had in Japan.  I was really full afterwards!  To this day, I still day dream about it every now and then and plan to come back as soon as I can!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>easily the best tsukemen you will find in SoCal, and probably a top contender for best tsukemen west of the Rockies.

fwiw, i only ever order the tsukemen when i come here. I'm sure their ramen is great, but the tsukemen is just that good.

the broth is velvety and sumptuous, the char siu is evanescently tender, and the noodles have a delightfully springy bite to them. squeeze the lime they give you over the noodles to add some brightness and acidity to cut through the richness.

the portion might seem small but a regular bowl of noodles and broth is a challenge for me (a fully grown man with a healthy appetite). with extra char siu (that is, in addition to the pieces already in the broth) and a seasoned egg, it's a veritable feast.

if you live in Southern California and like Asian food, you owe it to yourself to come here. undefeated.</review>< rating>

Went to this Noodle shop from recommendation from a you tube video.

This was our first time here and we wanted a nice hot bowel of noodles/ramen, because it was quite cool outside that evening.

We were so hungry and we both ordered Charlie tsukemen by mistake. The cold noodles were thick and delicious.  The slices of pork belly are amazing as well. The broth was a hot dipping broth in a separate bowl, also tasted good.

We both decided to dump the dipping sauce all over the noodles bowl to in order to avoid having to dip the noodles each time we took a bite to eat.

This combination was still good, but not what we wanted on the chilly evening.

Next time I am going to order the spicy ramen with level 3 heat.  That way I know we have ordered something served steaming hot.  The normal way we like or orders.

Going back soon!< /text>

The oil was even more horrendous than in Tsjida, Japan. The smell had not been removed and it made me sick. The restaurant is too small and too close to the neighbours, even though Corona is still there. The authorities should issue a warning for such a dangerous restaurant.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Greetings,
Attached is the receipt of my purchase to emphasize truth to my claims of having dined-in at Tsujita LA Artisan Noodle. First off, I had horrible experience eating here and will not recommend you eat here. The noodles were cold. Initially, I dismissed this as the style of the noodles early on as I felt this place warranted my patience and understanding of the dish. However, I was wrong because then the broth was cold, which is an understatement to the reality that no heat at all radiated from this highly reviewed restaurant.

Most importantly, I failed to accept this reality of having a bad experience as I like to remain optimistic until the server, Saki, confused me and my partner's order, henceforth, destroying the last remaining shred of patience and our commitment to wanting to have a good time. We did not enjoy a peaceful and delicious meal. We were provided a completely different broth after asking for the same broth, which ruined our entire meal as the flavor was completely different from our initial order. At no point was it communicated and presented to us an option to pay more for the same broth prior to the servers mistake that ruined our meal. When presenting with the facts, the server did indeed state that it was a different broth. Our first was pork/fish based and the second provided was soley fish based to the point that you can actually smell fish. One confronted with the evidence the server realizing her mistake lied to us stating that what we initially ordered was exactly the same. It was not the same. A child could see the difference in color let alone the taste. We are not blind. In light of Saki's rhetoric and delivery of speech, we now felt profoundly offended. To top it off, she remained committed to ignore her mistake and force us to pay. We were not presented an opportunity of a new dish but, an additional cost as a reprimand to a mistake we did not make.

In sum, I have not felt such dissatisfaction from eating somewhere in my 25 years in Los Angeles that I felt appalled to continue the conversation with a server with no customer service skills. To her defense, closing time neared at the restaurant and I felt an urgency from the servers to want to leave. It being the end of the day I completely understand the feeling of dread of wanting to go home. However, this carelessness cost me and my partner our time, money, and energy that we can never reclaim. I am grateful for the privilege to having identified a future chain of restaurants I will never dine in ever again and recommend. It pains me to write this. The reality is that this review is well deserved and if possible no stars should be an option. Thank you for your time and would be more than delighted to look forward to a response.< /Text><time>1612508064081< /time><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>
<Review>1st timer here. I have to say the tsukemen was very salty. It has a funky kind of gamey taste. I also ordered the ramen which was a little better but it has a strong vinegar smell to it. Very underwhelming. Go to Mitsuwa or Marugame! Much better tasting ramen and broth.
Really disappointed and there’s so many positive reviews and hype! :*[ :( ;(< /Review><user_name>Krispa</user_name>< Rate>

<rate>1< /rate><time>1617732685724<//time><Text>I’ve been lucky enough to try a lot of ramens all across the US. I still think Vegas and LA have some of the best outside Japan. I’d never tried Tsujita until today. I got one tonkotsu and one tsukemen ramen. Both were very dull compared to places like Mitsuwas ramen restaurants, and others around Hollywood. The tsukemen had a very game meat like taste, almost like it was slightly off. The tonkotsu ramen was basic but better than the odd gamey smell and taste of the tsukemen. This is supposedly the best ramen in LA, it’s not. The broths were also served lukewarm/cold to touch as a pamphlet is included for you to reheat yourself via microwave. Just not worth the buzz at all, in my opinion.

Edit: Got horrible food poisoning last night after eating Tsujita. Still feel bad today. It was all I ate yesterday so know it was that for sure. Saw it’s gotten a C health department grade in the past too, which was worrisome.<//Text>< userid>

Excellent ambiance. Easy to find right on a well trafficked corner. Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. Waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating of questions. Your entire party must be present in order to be seated due to covid rules so just be advised on that. Food was excellent and the drinks were standard fare for a nicer Japanese restaurant. Asahi and nigori sake were the orders in my group. The ramen was well prepared and the noodles had a good consistency and flavor to the broth. The pork was flavorful, tender and had a slightly smoky flavor which was VERY good. Extra noodles were quick to come out if you find you want more after you finish your initial bowl. Across the street is another Tsujita spot but we did not go over to investigate. Definitely would recommend a visit here. Side note, for parties over 4, splitting the bill can take a bit of time as it is pretty popular and waitstaff get busy.< /review>

<review>The wait was short even though it seemed busy, the service was really nice and they had options for extra toppings and noodles, as well as a choice for a level of spice, which was neat. The chashu was really tender and the egg was made really well. There were unique ramen choices, I tried the summer cold noodles. There was a fly that kept hanging around our table and that kind of bothered us a bit.< /review>< Pics>

One of the only great tsukemen spots in LA. The noodles are made perfectly chewy, and the rich broth is mouthwatering. There’s always a wait at the main store, so I suggest ordering takeout from their many other locations.< /Review>

New customer beware! Tsukemen is COLD noodles served with a side of lukewarm thick curry and cold pork belly. I expected the dish to be hot. No where on the menu was it clearly stated this is a cold dish.

The restaurant refused to make a new dish. Instead, they microwaved the noodles, and brought back a small amount of ramen broth to mix in with the Tsukemen broth to "bring it up to temperature". Very cheap and over charge for their copycat version of Chinese Dan Dan noodles.  This restaurant is over rated. They do not deserve royal customers. They have taken for granted the high reviews, and the reality is they fall short and the menu is MISLEADING!It's a cheap restaurant! Becareful to not get ripped-off!</Text>

The quality of this restaurant has really gone down. I went there expecting a great meal and good outside vibes and all I got was attitude from one of the waitresses and a bug in my ramen. Oh dont let me forget the giant favor she did me by giving me a "free" replacement like the bug she brought me in my ramen was my fault. Really  the service and the overwhelming smell of pork from the heavily fat saturated ramen has made this place a pass for anyone wanting good ramen.<//review>

The 30 minute wait was well worth it. This was my first time trying the Tsujita style ramen and it was quite memorable. The texture and flavor of the noodles were perfect. It certainly did not contain the strong lye water taste like most ramen. After trying this, I still prefer ramen with broth but I'm certainly hoping they would consider creating a light broth with the same type of noodles for those who prefer something light that day.

I did however, had to take away a star because my gravy/sauce was lukewarm.<//Review>

This is where you come to escape the hustle and bustle of LA. Although the wait is lengthy and you will be in and out in about 30 mins it's worth all the hype! The pleasure you can get from the famous tsukemen is beyond fantastic! Make the trip, wait the wait and dip those noodles to your hearts content!<//Text>

Adding lime on the noodles dramatically changed the taste.  The store suggested to try without lime first, and add it afterward.  It's really totally two different type tastes and both are very good.  It can be better if the temperature of soup can be warmer.  Long waiting line here after 11:30, but turnover is quick too.< /text>

<review>They may have descended from the untouchable, unearthly heights of the finest tsukumen in the country that they were when they first opened, but they're still a superb meal.

Ramen may be even more consistent and better these days, but when they're on their A-game, their tsukumen is among the very best available. When they're not, they're still damned good.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Waited 1.5 hours for this from 720pm.
One of the best ramen I've had. Very comparable to Fuungi tsukemen in Shinjuku. Be sure to add the light broth to the tsukemen soup at the end!</review>

<text>The tsukemen broth was room temperature and the noodles were served cold. Broth could have been hotter and more flavorful in my opinion. I will say the chatsu pork was fantastic though so it's worth a try. My fiancé loved it a lot more than I did.</text>< pics>

Best dipping ramen in the US !! I also like my spicy tuna bowl. The rice is so soft. Dipping sauce can be cold in minutes. So dig in before it's cold. Huge line every night, so be prepared. Awesome ramen. Highly recommended!< /review>

Seriously good dimsum comes to the Castro. We've been here three times and can't wait to come back again. Favorites are sweet rice with shrimp, sausage, and egg in lotus leaf; turnip cake; and steamed BBQ bun. Authentic and value!<//Review>

<Text>A small wait on a Wednesday evening. Service was friendly and attentive. Ramen was good - the noodles were excellent. The broth was on the saltier side of ramen but rich in flavor. The egg was ooey gooey inside but lacked flavor in the white.  The pork was tender but didn’t melt in my mouth. I did not try their signature TSUKEMEN but my friend enjoyed hers.<//Text>< Name>

<Text>Visiting this place was the worst experience I have ever had, we received the worst service from the waitress Saki who made a very unpleasant mistake with our food and the only thing she made sure was to collect the bill in the most unpleasant and aggressive way.

Tatsu ramen is really good here. The place is small and really crowded, we'd to wait around 20 minutes for sitting. The staff is great: friendly and quick. There is not parking here, but you can park around on the street. Don't do that on Sawtelle because you'll have just one hour.
Only cash. No cards.</Text>

Had small lines during the time I went in the middle of the afternoon on the weekend, but I could see a large wait-list from earlier. Parking is a real difficult adventure here, lots of the side streets nearby are permit only, be careful as people get ticketed here! Food was good however, tasty dipping ramen as well as the standard tonkotsu ramens!< /text>

This place definitely lives up to the hype. The dipping noodle broth is delicious. If you enjoy the flavor of garlic, tender pork belly and fat, you will love the broth. The service is very friendly  too. It was an all-around great evening.<//Review>

<text>My favorite tsukemen in LA! The broth is on the heavy side but it’s really comforting. The egg is boiled to perfection; the yolk oozes and it’s unbelievably creamy. The noodle is a little thick and firm. I personally prefer their tsukemen to their ramen.

The restaurant is rather tiny, and it does get really busy. The line can be really long especially on the weekends.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
First time having tsukemen and can't wait to try others. Was always a ramen person but I was blown away when I first tried it. Doing the noodles into a broth never appealed to me, but this was amazing the broth had so much flavor and the noodles were the perfect chewiness. Be sure to ask for more lime as the lime is what makes it that much more better IMO.</review>

Absolutely love this place. I heard a lot about this place and the other Tsujita across the street but we went here because they say the broth is more sea food flavored. The tsukemen here was fantastic.  Adding the lime really does change the flavor and makes it so much better. Service was quick and limes are unlimited.</text>

I would come back for more. The broth is very delicious n full with fatty fat from pork. The portion is big for small person like me. I'd recommend to share a combo bowl for a party of 2! The fruit (grap& peach) drinks are alright.  Peach one is lighter n better. Go for green tea- authentic drink< /Text>

<text>Wow another amazing ramen place in LA! I ordered take out from Tsujita and loved the attention to detail. Everything was packaged to perfection with instructions for how to enjoy your ramen from home. They provided reheat directions and the proper bowls/utensils.

The vegan ramen + egg was amazing as well as the Spicy Tuna Bowl. My boyfriend ordered one of the Tsukemen-style ramens and loved it! You will not be disappointed coming here!<//text>< pics>

Try their dipping ramen. Nothing else like it. Their broth is a little more thicker and saturated. Flavor is immense. Had to make this my first meal of the new year. Travel all the way from Orange County and willing to wait over an hour! Unbelievable food!< /Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>We had to queue close to an hour for 2 seats on a regular Wednesday late evening. The portion was large. The soup was good and pork meat was soft.However, their noodles was the horrible! It tasted like i was being served some thin Udon that was way past its expiry date - stale and hard. The noodles totally ruined my appetite.< /Text>< pictures>

Noodles are fat and have good texture and chew. The sprouts and cabbage add some crunch. Pork belly is very soft. But that means the fat falls off and into the broth. Could use a green garnish like scallions to make the presentation pop. Generous portion size.

Maybe an LA ramen style thing but the Tsukeman everywhere else I've had it (Japan - Kyoto and tokyo, vancouver and Toronto) provide less dipping broth. So I was stuffed 😁</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSFjXEeZgTbILs2odrhhaY5j8SE8QZLjiN2Snn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSsLFy8BXjjZlxk5BVFtLcLBfhLeKSef8qzXeW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Enjoyed everything thoroughly and was a bit disappointed that they didn’t have the dry chili paste that most tsukemen places have, but they had a nice replacement in the “spicy mustard”

While we waited there is actually a pretty cool store across the street so I would recommend that if you’re okay with a friend hanging back in the line.</text>< Pics>

The noodles had a nice chewy texture and the chasu was flavorful and fell apart easily. The broth, however, was overly salty even for tsukemen and it was hard to distinguish it's flavors beyond the salt.</Review>

<Text>Really good food. Awesome place to visit at any time of day. Don't even kid yourself and order the tsukamen ramen. Hands down the best one in Los Angeles. No one else comes close. If you have a huge appetite order a spicy tuna bowl as well, but it's not required. There's always a wait here and there is a reason for that but the staff has the system down and gets your food out almost immediately.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f< /gmap_id>< name>

<user_id>101894112267806111677<//user_id><text>One of my favorite spots for tsukemen ! I love coming here and it's definitely worth the wait. It often looks bad but the tables go in and out pretty quickly.

I would recommend getting their tsukemen upon visiting - I usually get it with the char siu and the boiled egg. They give you a huge bowl of noodles with a small bowl of thick thick delicious broth to dip your noodles in ! Be careful, it's quite salty to just be sipping on by itself.

How I usually like to eat it is with extra extra likes and if you like spicy, they have a jar of pickles greens that goes really well with the noodles. SO SO good.

Once you're done with the meal, feel free to ask them to thin out your tsukemen soup with some broth to end the meal.

10/10 would recommend. Although some people have said it may be a little salty, I think it's definitely worth trying.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Excellent ramen!  The pork broth is super rich and flavorful.  Noodles are thicker than more traditional ramen, but very good.  Large bowl is way too much food.  Be sure to get the boiled egg, it is to die for.  If you show up after 6pm, you'll have to wait for at least 1.5 hours.< /review>< user>

The gravy is super flavorful, I could drink it just like that ! Noodles are thick and fresh but I've had better... The service is also good.
The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly.

I think there's better options in Little Tokyo, I don't know why but this place left me a little bit underwhelmed.

Update** Their service is pretty terrible, especially since they opened up their new location in Glandale and transferred many of their stuff there. I was very dissatisfied on my recent visit. Food still rocks though!</Text>< Rate>

There are two Tsujita ramen stores. Do not confuse this store with the other one at the corner. The pork broth is thicker here. you can also taste a bit acidity. Ground spice is the killer.< /review>

The best ramen in Los Angeles. Must order Tsukemen, tsukemen is the best.  The only drawback is always many people here, you may need to wait more than 30 minutes. You should write down your name on the list first, and then you can order when the staff call your name.< /Review>

<Review>I was really looking forward to this authentic experience that was talked up by family and friends. My experience was rather mixed. We went with a party of 4 and although the line was a decent wait, COVID times meant not too many others were fighting for tables. The outdoor seating was decent for the size of the place and the QR code menu was an interesting way to stay sanitary.
We all ordered the standard go-to tsukemen which others recommended. I can see now why this ramen isn’t for everyone. Yes, the noodles are rather cold, and the broth that you dip in is supposed to counter that, but the broth needed to be hotter to do so. The noodles and the pork were great. Pork chashu is supposed to be that salty so no complaints there. Noodles were clearly authentic and had great texture.
The broth was something else. If you are sensitive to fishy smell/taste then you should stay away. The tsukemen is not advertised as being a fish based broth, but it was truly reeking of some sea-based product. Think fish gravy. Cutting the flavor with the added limes or even with requested chili on the side did little to mitigate that taste. One of our party’s members took one bite and was immediately put off eating any further.
I’d like to say that it ended there, but sadly several of our party members also suffered massive stomach pains the following night/day. Japanese food has never done that to me before, authentic or otherwise. We went out of our way to try this recommendation, unfortunately I won’t be passing the recommendation along. Be careful of hype.<//Review>< rate>

JAPAN 🇯🇵
Eat the World LA review:
Not to be outdone by downtown's Little Tokyo, the small area on Sawtelle Blvd with many Japanese businesses became known as Little Osaka. This apparently rubbed the wrong way on the folks that were not specifically from Osaka and eventually the strip was rebranded as Sawtelle Japantown, a decidedly boring name.
°
Anyone that loves Japanese food, and especially ramen, is supposed to come here for their famous tsukemen, tonkotsu broth that is simmered for a full 60 hours, sweetened and thickened by seafood. Tsukemen is served as components, you do the addition and subtraction yourself, usually dipping the noodles as you go. If you need more broth, it can be refilled. Ajitama tsukemen is broth with a seasoned soft boiled egg, it is also available plain or with char siu. After you finish your noodles, ask for them to pour in some light broth to the dipping sauce and enjoy the resulting soup on its own.
°
The standard bowl of tonkotsu ramen is also available here for those that prefer everything at one time.</review>

<review>After having some at an amazing little shop in Shinjuku, Tokyo, I was really craving some tsukemen (dipping noodles) once I was back in the states. I found this place had it, so I made the drive from Phoenix this weekend to give it another try. I was worried it would be an Americanized version, but I think they got it just right. The dipping broth is rich and thick like I remember and the noodles were great. I was a little confused at the end since I remembered the shop in Tokyo having insulated pitchers of soup stock (dashi) spread along the counter for pouring into your leftover dipping broth to make it thinner and more like a drinkable soup, but there was no pitchers on the tables they had here, and instead I was directed to this little "tsukemen" sauce bottle on the table... When I rephrased it, they took my bowl up to the counter where I finally saw the same sort of insulated pitcher I remembered from Japan. Once I had the bowl back with the warm soup it was just as tasty and made me feel happy to have made the trip from Phoenix. Thanks, all, for satisfying my craving! I hope tsukemen soon spreads across the US!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWjp-PlJ3S1KBLTCEUMejRxb6q31uhIkXxTHs7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I personally had a lot of Japanese ramen experience here and there but yet never tried this kind, dipping the noodles into the sauce! Loved the taste although a bit salty. There is a reaon for the long line even at night time- 10ish pm in LA with full of Asian food. I strongly recommend you to try the ramen with everything in and the salmon rice!<//Review>

<Review>Best noodles in Sawtelle, and definitely a must-go and go-to whenever humanly possible 🍜🙌🏼Perfect amount of spice in the "regular" spicy portion, meats are tender and fall apart upon contact, broth is on-point, with delicious depth, and the noodles are out of this world, done just right (al dente, little chewy to them). Everything is full of flavor and utterly delicious.</Review>< Pics>

<username>McKay “Onetricked” Zabriskie</username>< Review>
This place is Cozy and arguably the best Ramen in LA. The Annex is small and easy to miss but it is definitely a hidden gem. There are only about 15-18 seats here  so there is usually a wait, but they take your order and start it so by the time you sit down, your order is almost finished. Be prepared for a little strange smell as you wait.

The Ramen is really high quality and thick. The broth is thick and rich and bursting with flavor. It's goes well with the thick noodles. To top it off, the pork just falls apart in your mouth and makes the experience. I got a soft boiled egg to go with it and it is a must have.

Despite being so busy, the customer service here is as great as could be expected! They always keep your glass full and occasionally check up on you. I highly recommend trying this place at least once. If you don't, you will miss out.</Review>

<Review>Probably the best ramen shop in Los Angeles. I probably have tried the majority of the ramen shop in LA since before the whole ramen scene started years ago. This place remains as one of my top choices.< /Review>< pics>

<userid>116341123206486795205</userid><Review>So happy we were able to try this Ramen joint.  We've bookmarked it awhile ago.  We tried their famous dipping ramen.  I wished they served the dipping sauce hot rather than warm.  Save some noodles to warm the end to make it slurp up the sauce (ask them for noodle water to cancel out the saltiness of the broth).  The portion is big, but if you're a big noodle fan, order extra noodles for only $2.<//Review>< Rating>

I really like this ramen place! The staff is friendly and the food is very good! Always order the dipping ramen, and occasionally get a salmon or spicy tuna bowl to share s well. Always try to stop by when in town.</text>

This used to be my go-to for ramen, but I tried it again a few years ago and it was just meh - I'd go to Daikokuya for ramen instead.

But my housemate re-introduced me to their tsukemen a few months ago, and boy was it good. Even to-go. Definitely crave-able. Got it again a month or two later.</text>

Compares to ramen you get on ramen street in JR station in Tokyo.  Most flavorable I have had on West Coast!  When in LA, will find a way to renew the memories of just how good this place is.<//text>

<Text>I think Tsujita would hold it's own in Tokyo, though I wouldn't wait more than 45 minutes. Came on a Friday night and it took maybe an hour, as the restaurant is small. The meal itself is super filling. I recommend getting tsukemen with chashu and ajitama. It was my family's first time trying tsukemen and they enjoyed the new experience.

Don't forget to get the soup wari! Basically, the dipping broth is too rich to drink (simmered for 60 hours!), so at the end of the meal, you dilate it with broth water such that it's drinkable!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUDwJOPHyNtlegymYf8sZAI73DkjMhxZI9O3p-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Our experience with this company was horrific and disgusting and brought extreme suffering to my wife. I didn’t think it was easy to mess up ramen but Tsujita proved otherwise. The ramen was poisoned with a very bitter chemical that created a lot of bubbles, and it gave my wife severe food poisoning just an hour before our flight home. For almost 5 days of intense pain and vomiting, her face looked like what you see in the picture. Her lips grew massive to the point where they eventually started drooping down from the outside far worse than in this earlier photo. The chain refused to reimburse us damages for her pain and suffering. This is beyond outrageous - it flat out inhumane. Do not eat at this chain.</Text>< Pictures>

Great service, good food! Similar broth to Tsujita Annex, possibly even the same, but thinner noodles. The aroma of the broth was definitely just as strong when walking inside. I'll definitely be coming back to try out some other menu options!< /Review>

Visiting LA and friends pointed to Tsujita LA as a must - go for noodles.. When we get there I realize that it serves tsukemen... whaaa..? It's noodles cooked that you dip in the broth. Huh? Why can't we be Slurp-happy and eat ramen?

But tsukemen is a better way to go. You savor the broth-seafood origins that both coats the noodles and becomes a vehicle to taste all the intricacies usually lost while slurping ramen. They want you to try the broth first, then try it with a squeeze of lime, then enjoy with various additions-mine was a a jar of  turnip-like stuff that added heat in a very earthy way. I want to know where I can buy this stuff!

When you're done with the noodles they come around and ask if you want to add broth to your soup. The original soup is very thick, almost undrinkable, but adding broth makes it a very pleasant ending to a great lunch.

The hostess is very nice, sensing we were newbies( it's that obvious?) but explaining how to eat tsukemen for the millionth time in a way that we weren't a bother.

If you go, go early, we walked in at 11amand when we left at11:45 it was like the first showing of Avengers "Endgame." Well worth the first visit, looking forward to the next!</review>

Always delicious, always a long wait, but always worth it. You order while you wait and the ramen comes out basically as soon as you sit down.< /Text>

<review>YUMMY! I ordered a Tsukemen and my husband ordered a regular ramen. This is probably my favorite way to eat ramen! The service was great. It is cash only place. So make sure to have cash before you come. They do have an atm but when my husband went to pull some money out, the atm ran out of money. Cant say anymore because you should just go and try it out! Definitely worth going again!< /review></record>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>This place was really good, but for being touted as one of the "best in the world", I had higher expectations.

Personally, I didn't care for the service style of separate noodles that needed to be dipped in the broth. The noodles tasted very average to me, but the broth was really good. However, the overall dining experience left me underwhelmed.

Prepare to wait for a long time, even at 10pm on a weeknight.<//Text><Time>1558700966342</Time>< user_id>

<text>Highest quality tsukemen dipping ramen. The broth is savory and not too sour like some places. Don’t forget to squeeze lime on the noodles!

Also got the chasu ramen which was food but you don’t come here for that...

Long wait but the staff is friendly and efficient, taking your order while you wait so the food arrives faster. Parking is tight but you might have luck around the the neighboring streets.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjSiolcUq2xr56hwqR7sFHVJIERo6O6dc_VrTE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc-Z4CU_e3Oyn8u8OoRKwtgG33_8EHK98G2ZmW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

Pretty good, broth is super thick. Noodles are THICC. Meat is super flavorful and tender.
Tips:
- Ask if warm noodles possible
- Ask for hot soup if possible
- Ask for extra green onions
- Order everything plain, but ask for all toppings/condiments (spicy sauce, limes, etc.)
- ask for soup if you still have leftover tsukemen sauce</Text>

We ordered large ramen with extra meat and bean sprouts. Tasty. The soup is fatty. If you add some garlic, it would be great. It is exactly the same Dream Ramen in Boston. Very long wait, over an hour.<//Review>

Yum yum yum!!! I’ve been here twice once with kids and once with friends and I had a great experience both times. The workers are filled with diversity and seem to feed off of each others positive vibes. They are always packed but it’s worth the wait, I also love that when you leave all the workers say goodbye and thank you it makes you feel like there aware of your presence even while working I will def be back!!🤗<//Text>

<Text>Would love to give this place a higher review, but honestly, I don't think I could ever give anything more than 3 stars for a wait this long! Nothing is worth waiting hours and hours in line for!!

That being said, their tsukemen definitely is the way to go here. I've had tsukemen at so many other places in LA but nothing tops the unique consistency and taste that you get here.

I like the cheat and halfway through my bowl, I'll just dump the sauce/soup into the bowl of noodles because dipping is hard work! :P

Make sure you are mindful of your parking when you come here as the meters have limits and there are plenty of cops that will come by and enforce them!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Was recommended by my Uber driver to come and give this place a try. My first time eating ramen like this. They were absolutely delicious, the noodles were chewy and the broth was so flavourful. I would recommend having the ramen “hard”, you want to have a bit of a chew. If you can, try getting here before 4pm. Anytime after that and you’ll be waiting for a while. The prices are pretty competitive with other places around here. Will definitely come back here if given the chance.<//Text>

They also sell Asahi beer to accompany your meal.  Still amazing food, but I am really missing seeing everyone there and listening that funky music, (pretty sure the music has changed once in 7 years, haha).  I'll be back, as always!

I can’t go back to regular ramen anymore.

I really wish dipping ramen/tsukumen was more popular outside of LA! The intense broth/“dip” flavours were perfect for me and my meathead bros. It was like a seafood gravy, and the thick, chewy noodles were so springy they reminded me of jajangmyeon. The “stages” of eating it wasn’t just a gimmick either, it was lightening the flavours so you wouldn’t feel like death after! ALSO: the soft boiled egg was perfectly boiled, the yolk was legit like liquid gold and just barely settled.

There’s generally a wait time and no real good area to lounge, but there are plenty of places to check around while you wait. Since it’s LA, expect to park on the street and pay for the meter (which is actually free on weekends!).

It’s a lovely different way to enjoy ramen, and probably my favourite way from now on.</review>

< review>
I don't like to give bad review but this restaurant is overrated. We arrived around 6:30pm and got a table right away but as soon as we came inside we smelled strong odor and it was bad. I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and my friend had Negi Ramen. Mine was acceptable but my friend's ramen was not good at all especially the broth taste so yucky. After a few hours, we both got stomach ache. It was a huge mistake coming here. I'm giving 2 stars because George gave a good service otherwise i would give one star only.</review>

< Review>
There was a little bit of a wait for a party of 3, but not more than 15 minutes (on a Sunday for lunch). Service was pretty quick after we placed our orders. There are only 2 options if you're vegetarian (spicy or non-spicy), so be warned. The broth was well made, and the thick noodles make for a delicious meal. The spicy ramen gives quite a kick, and that was only Level 1 spicy. Overall a fantastic and filling meal!</Review>

5 stars for the ramen.  Really amazing and loved it so much I came 3 days in a row while visiting LA.  I hope the owner/manager will read this - On Sep 7th I had dinner there.  I saw one of your employees eat their meal sitting on a pot right outside the narrow space in front of the bathrooms.  He was trying to eat his meal while avoiding being hit by the bathroom door as customers came in and out.  This condition looked like something out of a third world country.  It broke my heart that you’re not offering a decent, clean and humane space for your staff to eat their meal.  I felt so sad for your employee and left with a very negative impression of your restaurant.  I hope you can take better care of your employees.  They deserve a clean and comfortable place to eat.  Please do better.<//Text>

<Review>Tastiest Ramen in LA. Super authentic. The noodles are amazing, and the broth is extremely flavorful. Wait times are very long though, it’s a small restaurant inside. If you have the time, it’s always worth the long wait. Great quality.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Listen. It's worth it. Everything you've ever heard? True and then some. This place most absolutely smacks. The quality that goes into this food will open your eyes and make you realize how blasphemous instant  noodle is.

Now yes, this dipping noodle. I'm an avid ramen lover and didn't necessarily understand the concept behind dipping the noodle. Why not just put it all together and call it ramen?

Well, the broth is actually very flavorful. So flavorful that if you take a spoonful, it's too much to enjoy for long. Dipping the noodle and consuming (slurping is best) immediately after the dip, will be just want you need to enjoy it best. And yes, you should enjoy a couple of noodles and then add the lime. It somehow does an amazing job at subtly attaching itself to the noodle even after being dipped. Top it all off by asking for some extra hot water and you've just enjoyed some of the best noodle you'll ever have.

While here, I ordered the Cha Siu Tsukemen and shared it. It was so good I had to return to order for myself. The second time I still ordered the Cha Siu Tsukemen with extra noodles and extra egg. I regret nothing.

I can't wait to be reunited with this place again.<//text><time>1581124160153<//time><username>Nathaniel Arias-Velez<//username><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqcbrIr13gMRPcD4RPXeBGL-cf-5QcyhTIg-Wx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><rating>5</rating><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

By far our favorite ramen place right now. It's an amazing taste at a great value. The artisan Ramen taste really comes through as well as the unique qualities of their handcrafted ramen. Only a few items in the menu but when food is this good you really don’t need much.< /text>

No line at all for weekday noon. Thought Ramen would be best but ordered Tsukemen. Very flavored soup base. But to me still a little bit salty, which is all Tsukemen I had in U.S. Maybe they adjust the flavor for local taste. However, It would be good if you don't dip your noodle into soup too long.</text>

Been a few times, suffered long waits each time, never been satisfied with the taste. Definitely acquired taste, not your usual Ikkousha, etc for yum. Even Jinya at the Hollywood and Highland mall is far tastier - broth there and Ikkousha are delicious.
11/26/17- Went again with a Japanese from Hokkaido. Ditto for me on the acquired taste - lukewarm dipping noodles, boring broth to dip out in, not enough meat by far. Feel like I just spent $13+ to be fed leftovers. Tons of better tasting ramen shops besides this one. That said, friend immediately noticed the fish flavor in the broth, and being Japanese, liked the dipping noodles. Only downside for her was not enough lemon to squeeze over the noodles.</Text>

<review>If you come before 6:15pm, there is hardly a line you will need to wait for. After that though, you may have to wait anywhere between 20-60 minutes, as the restaurant and its annex are quite small.The broth is most excellent, both ramen and tsukemen. The tsukemen broth is even more intense and fatty, but boy is it so delicious when you dip your noodles into it. Highly recommend this place.< /review>< pics>

Their noodles are actually quite good, yet I found the broth to be lacking. Not one of my favorite places in Sawtelle, but definitely acceptable for a lunch.< /review>< rating>

<review>My favorite noodle place by far. Come early either for lunch or dinner as it has limited sitting and there is always a wait. It's a dipping noodle with the best sauce and noodles I've ever tasted. I would suggest trying it once, maybe you won't love it like I do, but I promise you won't hate it.< /review>< Pics>

<review>First Star: Is the location neat? Yes. The turnover is fast but a staff member is always on hand immediately to clear and wipe tables.

Second Star: Is the staff friendly? Yes.

Third Star: Is the service prompt? Yes. Once you've braved the line outside your food comes quickly. The staff is also conscious of taking orders from those in line to make the service move even quicker. Very efficient.

Fourth Star: Is the product/service satisfactory? Yes. Absolutely. The tsukemen broth is hearty and rich. The cold dipping noodles make a fantastic companion to the hot broth, keeping their springy chew until you're ready to dip. The char siu is tender and full of flavor.

Fifth star: Is the price acceptable? Yes. Always worth it to drop in.<//review>< Resp>

See the red chili’s in the picture. Those chili’s are just one of the tiny nuances that makes this ramen one of the best. We arrived on a chilly saturday evening to have this ramen and I was pleasantly surprised to see about 30 odd people waiting to get in the restaurant. We opted for patio seating since the wait time was much less in the cold weather. Add 11.50 the ramen is priced reasonably but you do need to add 1.50 soft boiled eggs in order to make this ramen worth it. The broth itself is rich and the pork belly is soft and juicy. The best part about their ramen is that you can get extra broth for free. My girlfriend ended up having the vegan ramen which although tasted a little bit like pho but was worth it for her. Would definitely come back to try the tsukemen.< /Text>

Ate here 2 Sundays in a row. Excellent service and delicious ramen. I ordered the same dish both times, was really good both times but it was better on my 1st visit, the ramen tasted slightly different on the 2nd visit, like something was missing, but it was still really good ramen.</Text>

Great place for lunch or for a late night dinner after you go to the Universal Studios because this place closes at 1.30 AM. I love the Chashu Ajitama Tsukemen here. The gravy is super flavorful. The noodles are thick and fresh. REALLY GOOD! If you don't finish the gravy, they give you some broth to mix with the gravy so you can drink the broth as soup.

There is almost always a wait at this place, so if you're not willing to put in the time, come early or later, but I guarantee that Tsujita doesn't disappoint.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Wow. Usually when I hear of places like these, they end up being overrate, but I was definitely blown away.

Came here on a Saturday night at 8pm and the waitlist was still pretty long. We got lucky for a party  of 2 and was called in relatively quick.

We both had the tsukemen with chashu.
Hands down , one of the best, if not the best chashu I've had in a very long time .

The broth was very delicious for the noodles to be dipped in. The serving portion was pretty large as well. I came in starving and could not finish my food !

Service was very quick and attentive.

Definitely coming back</text><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

Great experience. Haven't eaten tsukemen for a while. The tsukemen comes with big chashu slices and seafood flavored soup. I like the idea of combing noodles with the lemon. Also, after finishing the noodles, they can add tonkotsu soup on top of your original soup. The only thing that I didn't like is that the soup gets cold easily of you sit   outside. Other than that, I enjoy everything.<//Text>

Before my visit, I'd never tried tsukemen and wasn't really a fan of Japanese ramen. However, the ajitama tsukemen here may have changed both of those statements. Well, at least in terms of dipping ramen. I thought the noodles were pleasantly chewy while the broth was thick and not overly salty. The soft-boiled egg and pork were as one would expect from a restaurant that specialized in ramen. My only complaint about the dish was that the broth was a little warmer than room temperature at best, and I'd prefer it to be much hotter. Overall, I left the restaurant feeling satisfied by both the taste and the portion, which is something I'd never experienced before upon finishing a meal at a ramen restaurant.</Text>

Tsukumen!!!!!!! Ok, got a little too excited there. Anyway, their ramen is different than the typical ramen that you usually hear about. Try them out!

Spend the extra dollar and get the tsukemen with the soft boiled egg which was perfectly cooked by Ramen standards. It's expensive for what tsukemen is, but the delicious taste of the soup will have me comming back soon. The soup had these bits of really salty meat which I think went perfectly with the noodles, especially if used sparingly. The soup got cold quick due to the nature of tsukemen so I can't complain about that. It was a bit loud in there on a Thursday night, so i only recomend this place if you want to eat Ramen and nothing else. If you wanna talk to your date or whatever, get it out of your system while you're waiting outside becuase there can be a waiting list when busy. Seating is a bit cramped but I guess if they had less seats then the wait times would be longer. My only complaint is that there isn't more space for this wonderful restaurant to supply the demand for delicious Ramen. I wouldn't call this a traditional Ramen restaurant but I don't think it's what they're going for anyway. They provide a lime to twist over your noodles which is odd but I'm digging it. There's also hand fans at every table which is nice if you start sweating from the hot soup.<//Review>< rate>

The standard go-to for anyone in Sawtelle, LA. Line wait can get long so be prepared, but the tsukemen (dipping ramen) they offer is tasty and comes with lemon midway to help zest it up. Friends have said that it's a bit too fishy for their taste, but YMMV<//Text>

We had the veggie ramen with extra negi (green onion) and the negi tonkatsu (you can't have too much negi). It was all very good. Try the special spicy pickled takana. Asahi Dry was very cold as it should be.<//Review>

The noodles are made fresh here and the best part: they're thick! Hands down the best noodles I have had in town thus far (if you like them thick that is.) But, like I was saying earlier, other joints will have broth flavors more fragrant than here.</text>< pics>

< review>
The egg is by far the best I've ever had with ramen. The noodles were the perfect texture and thickness, the broth though wasn't as great as everyone says it is and also there was a big fruit for problem where we sat.  We we're constantly being attacked by them sitting right next to kitchen.  They need to fix this I felt like I was in a food stall in South East Asia not in LA< /review>

Very authentic Japanese cold noodle. I've been there several times. However, the last time I went there, the served dipping soup was only warm ,not hot, which made you feel the soup was greasy! It was a little bit disappointing, but from my overall experience, it was still a good one!<//Review>

< Review>
THE FOOD HERE IS SOOOO GOOD! I'd go out on a limb and assume that their noodles are made from scratch and it's very delicious, I'd highly recommend the tsukemen. The menu selection is small, but I think it's a matter of quality not quantity. It's also expensive and they only take cash, but in my opinion it's worth every penny. As far as I can tell the food seems to be pretty authentic.< /Review>

The Tsukmen with Pork is incredibly filling and more salty then I like...although not so salty that I couldn't eat it. I wasn't the only person asking for a to-go container, as it was so filling and too good to leave behind. Staff is super, friendly and willing to explain the menu (there are actual instruction cards at each seat, advising how to eat this traditional food). Lines are long virtually all the time, so be prepared to wait, particularly on the weekends. For the food I'd give 4 starts, but...the entire facility could use a good scrubbing, the tables are sticky and restrooms poorly maintained, hence the 3 stars.< /text>

<text>This place changed ramen for me! I haven't found a ramen place that compares, they have a much different broth than most ramen I've tried, it's much fattier which makes it taste much richer. They have another restaurant with the same name across the street but it has a different style broth. You usually have to wait a decent amount to get seated because the place is small, but it's totally worth it. The pork is actually really flavorful and juicy too, definitely my top ramen place!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>One of the best ramen in Los Angeles. Their SOUPS are richer than most places. The WAIT could be over an hour on Friday nights and during peak hours. I have been there for quite a few times, and I notice a slight inconsistency in temperature of the soup base for Tsukemen. However, I still recommend this place. The serving size is not big and the noodles are priced at over $10 each, but the taste and quality of food make up the cost.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Its good but slightly overrated in my opinion. It's somewhat overpriced I think for what you get. I just had a bowl of noodles and then some extra noodles. With tip it was 29$. I think it's worth more like 22$ with tip.</review><pics>None<//pics><time>1555719712593< /time></record></dataset><record>

Wow what can I say...this is one of the best ramens I had. There was a line even at 2pm on a Saturday but totally worth the wait. The Tsukemen style is very interesting and their ramen/soup is so delicious that I forgot to take a picture before eating, then went straight to an additional bowl of ramen noodle and bottomed up all the soup after devouring the noodles. Happy and full, I can't wait to come back again. The service is very fast and friendly too!</Text>

Really good tsukemen (cold noodles with pork broth)! Be aware that there is a similar place called Tsujita Annex right across the street. That one has ramen in addition to tsukemen but both are different in their own ways. It’s about $16 for the meal which isn’t too bad considering how filling it is. Overall, exceptional food here though it can get very busy. Come on weekdays.<//text>

Tsujita is one of my favorite places in LA to get ramen and tsukumen. Their broth (which is the pillar of all good ramen) is rich and flavorful. You can taste the dedication that's been made to making the broth. If you're getting ramen, you can select thin, regular or thick noodle depending on what you like. It's slightly pricey, but you definitely get the quality you pay for.<//Review>

<Text>Don’t quite get the long lines or the supposed hype.  The noodles and the barbecued pork are decent, but the dipping sauce is just way too salty even when diluted with more broth.  Egg a little too runny for me.  The cash-only part only served to inconvenience particularly at a restaurant at this price point.</Text>< pics>

Super yummy! Ramen is my favorite food, and this place is top tier. They are known for their dipping ramen. I don't love it as much as traditional ramen, but this was bomb. I also love their chili paste. It's sooooo good.</Text>

< review>
The ramen here is delicious. It seems to be a small location just like in Japan, if you have ever been to ramen place in Japan you will know what I am talking about. It is pork based so if you can’t eat pork for certain reasons it is better you go to another ramen place. I got the ramen that you can dip your noodles in. The broth itself has a lot of cabbage and mung bean sprouts so the medium might be enough to fill up. I think from the dipping noodles the only difference between a medium and large is that you are given more noodles.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Delicious tsukemen! Service was fast and friendly. Don't hesitate to ask how to eat the tsukemen, the waiters love to help and there's also an instructional sheet for first timers.

Some tips:
1. it's totally fine to slurp, it's actually encouraged
2. if you're looking for spicy, add a spoonful of pickled mustard (karashi takana) onto the noodles. it's very spicy so add only a little at a time
3. You can add the lime at anytime, I like adding it with about a third of the noodles left. This way you can experience the different flavors throughout the meal.
4. Once you're done with your noodles, they'll ask if you want 'wari' (beef broth). This way you can slurp hot broth to complete the meal

<text>WOW. Probably one of the best noodles I've had in a long time. Get an extra egg. The only thing is the wait (Which you can expect for good food and I'm okay with) but also the weird smell from inside. It kind of ruined my entire experience.</text>< Time>

Everyone seems to like it much more than me. I personally don't like having my noodles separate from the broth. It was delicious, but not my preferred method of having ramen. The broth and noodles respectively were tasty. Watch out for the brown vegetable sauce that's on the table, it can be very spicy. Parking is difficult as it's located next to other very popular eateries.< /text>

<review>There are 2 Tsujita Ramen across each other, the one right at the intersection accept CASH ONLY and the soup not good as the other location across the street. Tsujita Annex is accepting credit card and the broth to me taste better, spicier. Both locations are busy during peak lunch/dinner hours, you could wait in line for 30 mins and longer for a table of 2. The space/table is small, you are literally next to each other and in other face! There are table/booth for larger group otherwise you have to share sitting. Pricey but typical in West LA, expect $15-$20 for each bowl of ramen after tax.< /review><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

<review>Wait times were abysmal, it took 20 minutes for my order to come out and another 10 to microwave it after I sent it back because of cold sauce. Music is grating and too loud. Wait staff are nice, but orders for the same table come out 15 minutes apart and often come out in sub standard quality. There is literally no excuse for having cold soup in a restaurant, yet somehow it happened here and somehow microwaving it took long enough for me to walk down the street and buy a coffee and come back and still wait another 5 minutes.

I took half my order home because I refuse to dignify such a place by finishing my meal there.< /review>< gmap_id>

First ramen experience and was not disappointed. Enjoyed the outdoor waiting area even though it is unusual. The ramen was delicious, the broth has a nice richness, the pork was cooked perfectly. Only complaint is from my wife as the fish sauce smell can be strong. I didn’t notice it after 5 min.</Review>

As delicious as advertised. I went pretty early and didn't have to wait very much, which I definitely recommend. Go ahead and order their specialty tsukemen instead of the ramen because they seriously know what they're doing. Such delicious noodles 🍜🍜🍜</Review>

<Review>Really good broth and nice firm noodles; said noodles were oddly thick and almost udon-like, though. One other odd thing... The bowls are overfilled to the extent adding garlic or the (excellent, by the way) spice mix is impossible until you've made a very serious dent in your meal, as it's just not possible to mix anything in.<//Review>< username>

I've driven 50 min just to come here. On three different occasions. This place is seriously good. Broth is thick, crazy flavorful while noodles are thick and have that "bounce back" consistency (Big Sean needs to eat here). Pork is also juicy and tender. Don't come here if you're not going to get your grub on.

Side note: I only get tsukenmen (dipping ramen, not traditional).<//text>

Let me save you the trouble of figuring out what to order - just get the tsukemen ramen. 75% of the time I visit I decide I want to try something different and order the tonkotsu ramen. And every time I wish I'd order the tsukemen instead. It's not that the tonkotsu ramen is bad, but their tsukemen is so much better. A thicker, more al dente noodle with a much more unique broth vs. the tonkotsu.<//Text>

We've visited a few times for dinner, and Tsujita continues to impress. Japanese classics and specialties, all done very well. Their homemade tofu is great, and I had a very satisfying onigiri. My family enjoyed the chicken rice, pork, and tempura especially. Would recommend grabbing a reservation for dinner.</text>

Fantastic! Food was authentic and drop dead gorgeous. What amazed me mpst was the speed...we were in and out in 22 minutes, well fed, and happy. This place gets the new trend of good food at a great price that will not make loose out on an entire afternoon. Kudos.< /Text>

I have been so reluctant to eat ramen since being back in the States after living in Japan for two years. But hands down this was pretty bomb. I had a regular pork ramen with all the green onions. Very flavorful broth, thin noodles which is my personal favorite, and the pork was cooked pretty similar. The one thing lacking close to JP was raw garlic that you can crush on your own. Oh and it was a plus that they had one Japanese female. But I wish we were greeted with "irashaimase!".< /text>

<Review>Fantastic tsukemen style ramen. There are some who really enjoy the rich unctuous broth (me!) and there may be some who find it too thick for their liking (bad coworker). Go try it to see if it is to your liking. Be prepared to wait, the line is always there for lunch and dinner<//Review>< Response>

<review>The best Tsukemen, for reals. After being introduced to it here, I seek it out at other ramen shops and haven't found any better than Tsujita's.
There's usually a line, btw.
Fast, friendly service.

<text>In my opinion, this is the best place to get ramen in the area--which is really saying something, considering all the options within 20 yards! Simple menu, small interior, and no-fuss service and seating. it's cash only, as well, though there is an ATM in the back, make sure you bring cash if you don't want to pay the fees.

You'll want to be prepared to wait, whether you're there before it opens for lunch/dinner or just walking up. There's always a crowd of people standing outside, and there's a list that has the parties in front of you that you can add your name to. If it's not raining, I would say it doesn't matter at all if you're seated inside or outside. The last couple of times I've been there, the wait has been around half an hour. Your whole party has to be present to be seated.

If you like spicy, the level 3 spicy Tonkatsu is the best! It's a lingering heat, not burning, so you can happily eat through the entire bowl, navigating through an abundant amount of red peppers and green onions. The meat is super tender and flavorful, and the noodles (best purchased "hard" out of all the options!) are firm and taste fresh. I always have trouble picking between that and the Ajitama Tsukemen, which is the dipping ramen--definitely an experience on its own. It comes with thicker noodles and broth than the ramen that comes with the noodles in the broth, and the texture is unbelievable. Extra limes for the noodles are a must, and so is getting the lighter broth at the end to enjoy the entire experience.

Overall such a great spot in a great location. For sure worth the wait, and even though it's super busy you never feel like you're being rushed; great experience with great food every time.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f< /gmapID><Date>1549653759149<//Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Leah Vergel de Dios<//user_name><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

This ramen shop I've been wanting to eat at for a long time and finally got a chance. There side soup dip for the noodles is excellent. Noodles is perfect hardness and chewiness. Egg is beautiful, never seen a more beautifully cooked egg. And the char siu is meaty and substantial. Love it! Pro tip, make sure to come early when it opens for no line! Also can get the added broth and its wonderful soup to wash it all down. Yum 😋<//Review>

It's not as good as the regular Tsujita restaurant. The broth was too fatty and they used too many additives in it. Should've just kept it simple. There were also a lot of flies in the restaurant which made it annoying having to keep swatting flies away while I ate. I did like the generous portion of bean sprouts though.< /text>

<Text>CASH ONLY!

I like the noodles here better then the actual Tsujita restaurant across the street. I usually get the tsukemen ( dipping the noodles into a hot broth). There is usually a wait to be seated - it's a very small place. They will only take your order when your whole party is there. Upon ordering, when they call you to sit they've already begun cooking your food so you'll get it, usually, within 5 minutes of being seated. Amazing fatty broth - don't expect to do too much after you eat here.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The lines are always long in the evening, so be prepared for a little wait. The tsukemen is well worth it though. The broth and gummy noodles are amazing. There are only a couple of booths that can seat groups of more than four, so go in smaller parties.</review>

I had been excited about going to dinner here. As soon as I walked in I was hit with the extreme smell of urine. It was pure acidity. We sat down and couldn't even stay for a minute. We got up and left. I was very disappointed with this. The smell was powerful and left my stomach turning. So sad.</Review>

<Review>I had been dying to try the place after hearing everyone raving about it.
While the tsukeman broth is full of flavor, I just can't get past the greasiness. *shudder*  Hubby's ramen was also undercooked!  I mean, really?!  That is an amateur mistake.  Oh yeah, and the amount of bean sprouts is just too too much.  Sorry.  Tsujita across the street is way better.</Review>< pictures>

The food is absolutely delicious, and pretty much everything on the menu is good (I prefer the char sui tskamen). You can even get a refill on noodles/broth for like $2 so you can take more home. The wait can be a bit long, but it is well worth it. I don't know how I'm going to cope without Tsujita if I were to ever leave.<//text>

Great ramen! For the tonkatsu, you have to get an egg separately so the cost adds up, but good quality. Would come back. Only 30 min wait too. Not sure how I'd feel if it were 1 hour+ wait as it can be during dinner times.< /Review>

<text>Amazing ramen place. I always say good ramen requires 2 things. (1) Noodles with a good, chewy texture that is not too hard or too soft, and (2) a tasty broth that is rich in flavor but not overly salt. This place has both of these qualities. Try it out!</text>< pictures>

This restaurant was my first encounter with high quality ramen and continues to be the gold standard in which I compare others to. It's absolutely delicious and worth the, sometimes very long, wait.

Its decent ramen but oh my god the SMELL of it is disgusting. I wanted to vomit, I had to force a spoonful down my throat, at least the taste was better but it was rather bland. Meat was good though but it was HARD getting over the smell. I have never been to a ramen place were the dish smelled like dank sewage.<//Text>

My husband and I had never had dipping ramen noodles before, but this experience has changed ramen for us forever. The balance between the cold noodles and the hot dipping broth made the perfect ready to eat temperature. The flavors of the broth and the lime on the noodles complimented each other perfectly. I don't think regular ramen will ever satisfy us again. The staff were all very friendly in helping us and talking with us about the experience.</text>

Tsujita is my favorite tsukemen place in LA, if not most of the world outside of Japan. The noodles are thicc and perfect in the summer with the tsukemen broth. I usually get the tsukemen with char siu and egg; packed with deep flavors and deliciousness. Sometimes I'll get the negi ramen (especially in winter), if you like your noodles ramen-style (thinner) and bathing with tons of green onions.</Text>

<Review>The tsukemen is very similar to the ones you will find in Japan. I would describe it as a diluted version of it. Tsukemen dipping sauce is traditionally more pungent and flavorful. The noodles are cooked perfectly but I don't recommend following their instructions about coating your noodles in lime. The lime easily overpowers the dipping sauce. It typically would not but since it is diluted it is easily overpowered. I give it a five star because it is the most closely authentic tsukemen I've found in the US.</Review><response>None<//response><Time>1517239478819<//Time>< GmapID>

<review>DELICIOUS!! The wait was 20 minutes which is really difficult for me to do because I get hangry. My friend was a little worried that I would rip her to pieces so we bought a snack nearby to hold me over. It was worth the wait. They take your order while you're waiting in line so that by the time you sit down, your meal is ready for you. GENIUS. I had the tsukemen with pork and added a soft boiled egg. I also added a ton of garlic--not that the broth needed it, but because I love garlic. These noodles were a perfect amount of chewiness and thickness. The pork was unbelievably tender, and so great with the slivers of green onions. I wish I lived in LA so I could come here all the time. The wait staff is super nice as well. Loved everything!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
The food was not good.  It's hard to screw up noodle soup but that happened. My soup was cold and the noodles were gummy. The server was rude and our original server went home during our order and didn't mention he was leaving.

The people seated next to us who were seated at the same time got their food a full 20 mins before us. This place is also cash only. Most people usually don't find out until it is time to pay the bill when you have to run to an out of network atm and eat the $3.00 to them and $2.00 to your bank.   I would never return to this place.<//Review>

Chashu Tsukemen!  their broth is extremely thick and flavorful.  I went in famished w/ eyes bigger than my stomach.  I ordered the large, but it was too much b/c the soup is so rich.  i would suggest one just orders the regular.  Also, make sure you request hot broth at the end of the meal so you can water down your soup and drink it.<//text>

If you have never tried tsukemen  (you dip the noodles into a think brother) do yourself a favor and go to Tsujita. It's like no other noodle dish around. The broth adds plenty of flavor and the noodles are great.</Review>

<text>The best tonkatsu ramen I've ever had. The broth is simmered for 60 hours, and you can taste it, it has a rich flavor and smooth mouthfeel. It's a busy place so expect a wait, maybe 15 minutes. However the service is quick and the food comes out within a few minutes of ordering. I recommend the boiled egg add-on and the hot mustard condiment for extra flavor. Cash only.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This place used to be the best. Now everytime I go for like the past 4 months the soup is super cold. Halfway through your meal all the fat in the soup starts to harden. You guys really need to raise the level of heat because it's honestly not as good as it used to be.</text>

<text>The absolute best ramen I've found on Sawtelle. I prefer this location to the annex, as they use lime and the fish broth isn't overwhelming. Their staff is friendly and they know how to get you in and out without feeling rushed. If you're looking for ramen, there's a reason this place is always on the top of LA foodie lists.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Legit tsukemen ramen! This will leave you full and satisfied for sure. I used to never enjoy ramen all that much because I'm never full afterwards like I am eating pho...but oh boy, this place is quite the opposite.

We ordered the Tsukemen Ramen with Chaw Siew. They give you a solid amount of thick and perfectly cooked ramen noodles. I'm a sucker for the thick noodles, thin ones just don't do it as much for me. Next to the heaping bowl of noodles is their awesome creamy and rich broth.

With Tsukemen, you dip the noodles into the broth and then consume. The broth isn't meant for you to slurp on like other ramen bowls, which makes this a somewhat fun experience eating. The broth itself has scattered pieces of meat inside amongst other things and very flavorful overall.

The ramen also came with a softboiled egg which is obviously very tasty. We ordered sake on the side as well.

Overall a pretty good place to get yourself a bowl of Tsukemen Ramen and a nice family ambiance inside. Highly recommended! There is apparently also another restaurant that is EXACTLY the same across the street to help with the popularity and wait time.< /review>

<Text>I like this place a lot more than the Annex next door.  The ramen here is somehow better but it is a little oil.  Don't say I didn't warn you!

I got the dipping ramen when I went and it was great!  Nice pieces of pork, good amount of noodles.  You get your bowl pretty fast too.  Probably within ten minutes of ordering.

There are a few add on options you can get but the dish really doesn't need anything extra.

I would come back.< /Text>< Response>

I really wanted to love this as much as Tsujita LA across the street but I didn't. There was more than a fistful of bean sprouts which made it seem like It's the focal point. The noodles and the broth should be the star, not the dirt tasting bean sprouts.</review>

Mixed review for me. This was my first experience with Tatsu ramen. The flavor was very good, but the broth was room temperature...once mixed with the cold noodles, it was cold mess. Not a fan.

I also ordered a spicy ramen which was excellent. Piping hot and a wonderful aroma and flavor. Chili peppers added additional heat, but not too much. I ordered a spiciness of 2 out of 3.

Bad part - server spilled a quarter of the piping hot ramen all over my leg. She helped to get napkins and clean her mess, but did not compensate me with a discount or any other offer. Not an ideal way to treat your customers.

All in all, a good noodle house, but nothing out of the ordinary or exciting. Small, cramped quarters without any charm or pizazz.</text>

I was so full after a 2:30 pm bowl of ramen here that I didn't need dinner. Is it my favorite bowl of ramen on the Westside? No, but it's solid.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I love their heavier, creamier, spicer Tsukemen Ramen.  It is a fun experience to dip cold noodles into a hot broth with lime on top.  The food is good, but it is very heavy so you may end up sleepy by the end. The wait for the place can be bad.  Expect to wait up to 2 hours.<//Text>< Pics>

Easily the best Ramen in town. Their Tsukemen ramen is perfection with thick ramen noodles, perfect soft boiled eggs, tasty fatty pork and the best creamy broth. I love that you can ask for more broth for free.<//text>

Tsukemen style so broth on the side. I got the chasu that had pork belly with the noodles and bbq pork+bamboo shoots in the broth. Plus a tea marinated egg. Pro tip, when you run out of noodles and have broth left over have them bring some hot water to enjoy the remaining broth soup style. Also, there's typically a wait but it's worth it and the patio is dog friendly, major plus.<//text>

I had the Sake Ikura Don which was great. I also ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I'm not sure if I just haven't eaten at enough ramen restaurants but I didn't like the broth at all.. also they only take cash here which threw me off as well. I'm wondering if I would have had a better experience at their annex restaurant down the block<//review>

Great authentic Jiro style ramen. Lots of topping to be sure to fill you up. Noodles are thick and chewy and the soup is amazingly rich. Worth the wait.<//text>

It's good but don't believe the hype. Plus, when we finally got seated after 30 min they had no ramen broth only tsukemen. They failed to mention that until they sat us. I've had better ramen without waiting in a sea of hipsters.<//Text>

Get the Charsiu Tsukemen! They'll teach you how to eat it if its your first time! Noodles are cooked perfectly, the soup is tasty (though a bit salty). Get there early to avoid a wait. Parking is a hassle as its on Sawtelle.< /text>

My second time eating here and both experiences were great! You usually have to sign your name and wait, but most people are pretty good about eating and leaving, so, it doesn't take too long for seats to open. I've waited no more than an hour, and it's worth the wait if so! The staff does get busy running around but are always willing to help and with friendly service too. I definitely recommend eating tsukemen with chashuu. So good!! They have a cute illustration that shows you the proper way of eating it and the waiting staff can explain too if you ask. Remember lime in the noodles! Then dip noodles into the broth. I would definitely recommend eating here if you want to try delicious, authentic tsukemen.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Tsujita has irrevocably changed my views on ramen.

Any time my partner and I are in LA, we make at least one trip to Tsujita for ramen. It is well worth the often extensive wait.

The service has always been great and the ramen itself is simply superb.< /review>

<Review>I did not like this place at all it was in the ramen that I tasted in Japan I was kind of disappointed and even though they have a different way of doing her mom and because they did mention that I just did not like it the taste of the ramen was for some reason fishy and it just smelled bad it kind of seemed like they added Dashi or even fish sauce to their broth. Just wasn't my cup of tea and I don't think I will go back to this place.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Have been meaning to try this place on Sawtelle for some time. Finally bit the bullet and went to Tsujita for my usual Sunday noodle lunch with my girlfriend.  I must say the food was great! I had the spicy pork ramen (have forgotten the official menu listing) and was pleasantly surprised at the firey heat that the level 3 spicyness brought with it. I mean by simply looking at the bowl you would think it were a normal pork ramen bowl, but one spoonful of that broth will let you know that looks can be deceiving. My girlfriend had the tsukemen (sp?), and was very happy with her plate.

Overall, this place is another great addition to the cuisine offered here in Little Osaka/Sawtelle. Be cautious as this restaurant is VERY popular so be prepared to wait if during peak hours. The taste is well worth the wait, and the pricing is fair.  Can't wait to return.< /Review>

<Name>Jason Medina<//Name><Review>/!\~CASH ONLY~/!\  Google photo is incorrect as of 2016-10-05.  The dipping ramen (tsukemen) is tasty and so is the ramen.  Very good, high quality broth and great service.  The annex is up (north) the street and to the right (east) from Tsujita restaurant.  There can be a wait list, and parking is tough - but it's worth it!  This place is cash only.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f</gmap_id>< Time>

<Text>Five stars isn't enough.  Six wouldn't be either.  I had eaten tsukemen many times before, but I never really knew what it was before eating here.  So fair warning, it's life changing and you will forever compare all other ramen and tsukemen to here and they will be lacking.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

If you're a gourmet foodie, this is the spot. Simple but heavy ramen broth, fresh noodles, and enough temperature to enjoy the warm bowl til the last drop. Theu give such large portions so its well worth the 45min wait.<//text>

This is the place that introduced me to tsukemen - thick, cold, chewy noodles dipped in gravy-thick hot soup. Oh buddy, this is the good stuff. As I understand it each of their locations features a different style of broth (hence why there is a second restaurant across the street). If I understood my server correctly this location is fish and pork, and the Annex is just pork. Both are amazing (but I do prefer the Annex overall). Slightly more expensive than most ramen-ya but definitely worth it. Blows all of the hipster competitors out of the water. Don't forget to get soup wari when your broth gets low.

Some caveats: Cash only, but has an ATM. No vegetarian options as far as I know.<//review>

You will have to wait an average of 30 minutes before you get your table at this this popular ramen outpost and it is well worth it. I ordered the Char Sui Ramen and the Spicy Tuna Bowl. The Ramen was very flavorful and cooked just right. I was also very impressed at how fresh the tuna. Parking can be a bit challenging so be prepared to look in the neighborhood for parking. Also make sure you have cash for this location.< /Text>

<Review>Great dip ramen! Very delicious and tasty. The noodles here are different than other ramen places. It's more of a thicker and chewy noodle where you dip it in a thick soup and eat it. The only bad thing is the normal wait is about 30mins or longer. They should implement phone -text wait system, therefore customers don't have to wait out in the cold.</Review>< rating>

<Text>Decent place for ramen. Expect to wait at least 30 mins for a table. Food is served quickly once you sit down. I had the char siu tsukumen. The pork is very soft and tender and the noodles are cooked well. You dunk the noodles into the pork broth and then slurp it up. The broth did a great job warming up the noodles initially, but quickly became luke warm and didn't do so well warming up the noodles after about 5 mins of slurping. The broth is full of flavor, but very concentrated. Once you are done with the noodles, ask the staff to thin out the broth to make it drinkable.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I love this area, so many different restaurants that I want to try them all.

First things first, they take your order outside so that the food comes as quick as possible when you sit down.

Since there is only about 20 seats they try to push customers in and out! (reminds me of my server days at a Japanese Ramen Restaurant)

This is an extension of the original restaurant across the street.

Regular size bowls were 10-12, and large were 14-16

The large size is huge! enough to share with someone so you can enjoy other items on the menu. OR get 2 large and split between three people.

The Char - Siu pork is tasty! head across the street for dessert at block heads! Sawtelle is like better than Little Toyko at this point!<//Review>< Rate>

<Review>I finally got to try Tsujita! The ramen here is quite delicious. I can't say if its the same, similar, totally off as from the original Tsujita but I did enjoy my meal here. I got the Tsukemen with soft boiled egg (and asked for less salty from reading other reviews) . The broth is VERY oily - it made me feel super full for the rest of the day- I don't recommend eating this often but it definitely is a treat once in awhile. I believe the spicy sauce was what made the broth, mmm my tummy is just dreaming about how delicious it was :) The soft boiled egg wasn't really soft - boiled, I usually like it runny but some people may prefer it the way Tsujita makes it. The wait is long though, definitely be prepared!<//Review><user_name>Annie Lin<//user_name></record>

I don't want to overcomplicate this and write a super long review because it's pretty simple: DELICIOUS TSUKEMEN.

Note that Tsujita has two locations pretty much across each other. This is  the ANNEX. Both are great but if you prefer a fattier, richer broth then I highly recommend the ANNEX over the OG location. And yes, the line is equally long for both restaurants.

If you go during off hours, you'll get a chance to avoid the line but if you want to eat during normal lunch/dinner hours, then prepare to wait (like 1-2 hours). Also this place is CA$H only. The menu is pretty simple, highly highly recommend getting the tsukemen. The portion doesn't seem too big but it is really filling, because of that I recommend getting the regular size and then getting an a delicious tuna rice bowl add on :) Taste the broth alone and then add in a generous heaping of the chili and garlic because it tastes sooooooooo good all together. The tsukemen broth is thick, fatty, rich, savory and perfect for dipping your noodles in!

If you're a fan of noodles (especially chewy thicker noodles) then you have to try this place! It's worth the wait.<//Text>

I've only been for lunch.  The noodles are the best in LA.  Tsukemen or ramen are delicious, the service is efficient, music fun and the decor is refreshing.  I love lunch here, come early to avoid the lines.<//Text>

The does broth has a unique smell because of the pork simmering for 60 hrs so dont be throwned off. Between the ramen and the dipping noodles i prefer the 2nd choice. There is more flavor.< /Text>< pics>

Very reminiscent of tsukemen I've had in Japan. Noodles were the perfect hardness and the broth was just salty enough.  The charsiu melts in your mouth.<//Review>

<user_name>Jennifer Lo</user_name><date>1510338496880</date><rating>5</rating><review>Voted number one in LA and it lived up to the hype! The ramen was so good. I ordered the tsukemen and the tuna don. The tsukemen is the dipping noddles where they give you a bowl of thick concentrated broth and you dip eat bite into the broth. The broth had a strong bonito flavor and wasn't overly salty. The noodles were also perfectly chewy. I ordered the tsukemen with the pork slices, but the normal bowls already have pieces of pork mixed into the broth so don't worry about not having meat. After you're finished with your noodles, you can ask for broth to be poured into your bowl in order to drink the tsukemen broth. This is one of the best bowls that I have had! It's alway great because it is open till late night!< /review>< Pics>

The tsukemen broth was too cold and lacked the right amount of vinegar for my taste. Somehow the annex location across the street is much better...</Text>

Awesome joint for Tsukemen aka dipping ramen. You can add wari (extra broth) at the end for free. Table condiments are fresh garlic and chili flakes. In my person opinion, this place has a low noise level, which is great if you want to focus on the delicious bowl of noodles and watch the chef's expertly prepare them. No distractions, basically! The flavor of the broth and bite to the noodle will make you come back. Many ramen shops serve Tsukemen, but Tsujita sets the standard. Try their other locations for broth variations and table condiment variations. Other locations also have full menus with plenty of delicious Japanese options.<//Review>

Over the past year, I've been trying all the Ramen on the west side I can. This is hands down, the best char siu ramen I've had. I am hesitant to say this, as there is limited seating, and this could only increase the amount of people eating here.

The staff is unbelievably efficient, taking orders from those waiting when the bill has been delivered to patrons inside . It's rare on LA to be treated to top notch food and service, in such an efficient manner.

Cash only, maybe a 10-15 minute wait to be seated.<//Review>

I had never had dipping style ramen before going here, it is delicious.  Tried the regular ramen and that is pretty amazing as well.  This place gets busy so i usually end up going at off times(they are open kinda late).</Text>

I liked the option to add garlic and spice powder to customize the taste of the broth to your liking. Since I like spicy food, I spammed the spice powder and it was all worth it. Noodles definitely stood out as it was nice and bouncy to the chew.

It would be better if the broth can be a lot hotter so that it doesn't go cold a few minutes into the meal. But I think that may be how tsukemen is supposed to be so nothing much to do there.</Text>< Pictures>

If you can't make it to the Tsujita across the street for Tonkotsu ramen (served during lunch only), come here and enjoy their Tsukemen. The noodles are thick and chewy, and the broth is delicious. Street parking available in the residential area.< /Review>

tsukemen done so right (probably the best in LA)
the service is super attentive for how small the place is
come ready to wait because newcomers and regulars are equally excited to get a bowl every single time
cash only and, if you're in a group, make sure you specify it's not the annex
(that's a whole 'nother story)<//text>

Great ramen. Soup is delicious! The price is a bit high but it is good ramen so it is worth it. We devoured the ramen! The wait can be long but you can put your name down and go to Daiso and explore.<//Text>

I love their noodles here. They aren't the typically skinny ramen style, they're plump almost like Udon. I always order the ramen with or without extra char siu. The broth is heavy and flavorful. The red seasoning is very addicting. The wait is always crazy. However, I do appreciate the staff taking your order before you get seated so you get your food shortly after being seated. Parking is also difficult so be prepared for that!<//Text>

<text>his place seem really popular when I heard about it then once I tried it not sure if its really worth the drive from one part of L.A. to the other side for dinner at this place. I had the popular Char Siu Tsukemen Ramen. The broth was really salty and the noodles were cold even after dipping it in the broth to eat. The waitress told me that after I finish the ramen they can pour some hot water for the broth then you can drink it like a soup. I felt like this ramen was a lot of work to eat so I just pour some of the broth all over the bowl with the char siu and ramen so it was easier to eat especially if you're not good with chopsticks.

I found the chopsticks to be a struggle when some places don't have chopsticks that grip the food easily. I got my blouse dirty from the broth splashing on it. I suggest you don't wear nice clothes if you really want to eat with the chopsticks and am not good at using them. Plan on paying for parking if you dine on Sawtelle Blvd. Don't park at a meter when it might only be limited to 1 hour parking.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>Too rich for my blood

Normally I'm a huge fan of rich flavors, really though, I stand in front of restaurants with a giant foam finger with dollar signs ($$$) on it...a true fan of richness.  But I'm also like Forrest Gump, "I'm not a smart man, but I know what flavor is..."  I just don't get it, why is there 736 UCLA students waiting out front every time I drive by? Don't you guys have to study or something?  When I was in college the only ramen I could afford was in a plastic bag ("mì gói" in Vietnamese).

Let me tell you where this rich flavor is coming from...

I ordered two ramen bowls because I'm a freakin' fatty.  Side note...I was called into a meeting at some hotel room last month and it was my whole family there with TV cameras for a fatty intervention.  I tried running but my thighs cramped up from the stress my stomach was putting on it and fell straight to the ground.

Back to the story...I took one of the bowls home to finish for my fatty midnight meal, put the rich "broth" into the fridge and when I took it out like 75% of it was coagulated fat! Enjoy kids.  Eat up and go study.</Text><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>I can understand why others like it so much. It's very flavorful and the noodles are what I would consider a step up from the supplier that the vast majority of places get their noodles from. But for me it's just far too heavy. Both the ramen and tsukemen feel like I'm ingesting liquified fat. The tsukemen is probably more enjoyable because you control the amount of broth and it is actually cleaner despite being thicker.</text>< Pictures>

I got the ramen and the  large bowl was unexpectedly large but I was not a fan of the noodles. The noodles were almost like spaghetti by being very thick and cooked to a very al dente/firm texture. The pork was very soft and the broth was ok with some scoops of garlic. Ramen is also on the expensive side while the place is cash only. Also wasn't a big fan of the heaping portion of bean sprouts.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

So we can't have three combinations or four combinations? It makes no sense. They also charge 5% extra for the "kitchen staff" added in the bill.<//text></record>

If you're tired of Shinsengumi or Daikokuya, give Tsujita a try. For starters it's dipping noodles rather than traditional soup noodle. Do mind the line though; I'd recommend coming at non peak hours... Or if you have immense luck, come whenever.

So it's simple, come in, order the Tsukemen as that's what they're known for. The dipping broth and ramen come in separate bowls and may confuse you initially but take a look at the eating instruction manuel if it's your first time here or ask a waiter. Get extra limes and apply to the broth as needed. I enjoyed the ramen texture and the broth but be prepared for an oily broth. The meat was wonderfully made and practically melts in your mouth.

So the experience is probably novel for most people but it's definitely worth trying. The ramen is a little more on the expensive side though, and the broth cools down pretty quickly so it's best to eat as soon as you get your food. Cold ramen with cold broth is not pleasant at all. Oh and Tsujita is cash only so be prepared for that.</text>

There is something sinfully delicious about the dipping broth - it is so flavorful that i was literally amazed with my first bite.

Dont make the mistake of trying to sip on this broth! it is definitely a dipping broth, but they will give you broth to dilute it out if you need to. I found that the portion was large, i was much happier sharing a large than trying to eat a medium by myself. Either way, I always leave feeling very happy and full.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Great Broth for the Tsukemen!  The noodles have a perfect bounce that supplement the Tsukemen broth!  Definitely one of LA's best!   BTW, if you have a knack for hot (as in high Scoville units) and savory,  add some KARASHI TANAKA from the condiments section.<//Text>< pictures>

This is for sure my favorite ramen shop! The complexity of the broth is out of this world! Perfectly balanced, it is truly sensational. Its served tsukemen style which is when the noodles come separate from the soup.

The broth is rich, fatty, spicy and is loaded with garlic. The noodles are thicker than standard ramen noodles. They are similar to udon but with the bite and texture of a ramen noodle.

If you want to know how this stands up to ramen in Japan, I can honestly say this is as good as the best places over there. I recently visited and made sure to eat ramen all over the country and Tsujita is as good as any of them. I have also taken many Japanese friends here and they confirm it's greatness!<//Text>

Every time when I go to LA, this is a MUST GO place for me! Guys, if you like ramen, you should come here and TRY! I like their Tsukemen! It's my first time having ramen with the noodles on a bowl and the soup on the other. It makes the noodles less soggy when we eat.

Talking about the Tsukemen, the soup is really strong and rich, which is a good thing. But last time when I went there, the soup was a bit too salty, but other than that, everything was PERFECT! The overall presentation is nice and I like the idea that they have one big piece of fried seaweed on the noodles bowl, which is perfect for a person like me, since I don't really like to dip the whole seaweed into the soup.

I will definitely try their other ramen next time when I visit LA!< /review>

<date>1452578346854< /date><Rating>4<//Rating><text>The tsukemen (dipping ramen), which is what it's known for, was pretty good here. Definitely a hype I would say though. The broth is very salty and heavy, but that's what real ramen is! Although the taste, I thought was mostly just salt instead of the actual flavor of the broth. The actual ramen was really good though, with thinner noodles and not as heavy broth as the tskuemen. If you're in the area, definitely check it out! Not something I would wait for over 30 minutes though. Also it was pretty expensive - $35 for two for a char siu tsukemen and a salmon over rice.< /text>< pics>

Showed up 15-20min before the store opened on Saturday with Steph Y. and Emily R. I think we were the third group on the sign up sheet.

The service was fast and we only waited few minutes to be seated.

I got their tsukemen and it was so fatty and flavorful. I can see why it's so popular :) As much as I love ramen, fatty broth isn't my #1. It's def the best tsukemn I ever had and I do recommend it to all the ramen enthusiasts out there. The ramen is only available for limited time everyday (?).

TIP: Best time to show up is few minutes before they open. If you show up later you will end up waiting for a very long time. I think the service is faster when you're one of the first to eat.

Cash only!</text>

Alright so I've been hearing how everyone says this is the best ramen in LA.  I had to find out for myself.  Yes, I got the tsukemen ramen with charsiu.  You have 3 different stages to eat the ramen.  First stage is just dipping about 1/3 of your ramen into the broth and eating it.  The second stage is to squeeze lime into your ramen and finishing your noodles.  The final stage is adding the soup wari into your broth.  I would have to say the second stage is my favorite (adding the lime into your ramen noodles).  The broth is definitely really good, but it is a little too heavy in my opinion.  For my taste, it can get a little too salty too.  The seasoned egg is okay.< /review>

If you Google search "best Ramen in Los Angeles" a great many lists and opinions will point toward Tsujita. The Tsujita Noodles Annex resides just across the street from Tsujita proper with a more limited menu, sticking only to the ramen and tsukemen that people clamor for.

I wanted to love the Annex. As a fan of good Japanese ramen, I felt no need to venture further west than Little Tokyo, but no longer could I ignore the much publicized Tsujita. Once you get to the Annex, you walk up, sign your name on the list and begin the wait. After about a half an hour, our order was taken, and another half an hour later, our name was being called to take our seat in the restaurant. The most notable experience when walking into the Annex is the smell. I wish it was a pleasant one, however, it was, for lack of a better term, funky......something like dead animal, stinky feet, and cheetos. Apparently, it is the slow drawing out of all the lovely flavors that go into the broth that brings out this smell.

Being that our order had been placed long before, our ramen was out shortly after being seated. The ramen came, a heaping serving of bean sprouts atop. Traditionally, I like to dive into the broth before anything else when eating ramen. After doing so, I had nothing else to think but, "this tastes like liquid fat." It's definitely flavorful, but as fatty and salty as could be. Once you mix everything together, char siu, bean sprouts, noodles, etc., you see how it all works together, but alone, the broth is impossible to enjoy. Unfortunately, there were a couple other issues. The additions to the ramen were cold. Obviously the bean sprouts were cold, but the char siu and egg were also, which created an odd experience.

In the end, I can appreciate the authenticity of Tsujita's ramen, but it has not persuaded me to move away from Daikokuya.< /Text>

Tsukemen is so salty and heavy. I guess that's the point since you just dip it and squeeze a little lime on it, but I could barely get past the first half of the bowl (and it seemed like everyone around us had similar experiences). To be fair I only waited 15 mins so if I had waited longer I'd probably hate this place.

The noodles (esp consistency) and soft boiled egg are good though so I'd be curious to try the tonkatsu in hopes of having a better experience!< /text>

Tsujita LA is the most fascinating ramen place I've been to.  For one, they only serve ramen in this particular restaurant at lunch time (11am-2pm) and you should expect a line if you don't come a little before it opens.  The ramen here is very milky and heavy compared to the other choices around.  Some people will not like it because it really bogs down in your stomach but the flavor feels absolutely delicious and the noodles are just the right size.  All-in-all, a great choice for more experience ramen adventurers.  (Expect to pay around $10 along with the ability to slightly add more ingredients).  There are also some other noodle options that I didn't have a chance to explore.

Parking-wise, as usual in this area, look around the neighborhood nearby or on the street.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Not exactly a ramen aficionado but the soups were great. The wife had the ramen with egg and I had the tsukemen. Both were great and I loved the multiple flavors you get with the tsukemen when you do the lime, then add the wari soup to the broth when you are done with the noodles. I would assume most of the other ramen places only a few yards away are great too but the service is quick and the servers are super attentive to the customers so you can get in and out here. There is always a line when we walk by this place but it moves quickly.  There's even a second kitchen across the street if this place is busy. It seems the other ramen shop near the milk tea place is always full of college students who like to sit and chat for hours.< /Text>< Pics>

Super-delish ramen! The tsukemen ramen is awesome and a must-try if you've never been here. It's very rich. One of my faves is the negi ramen when I'm not in the mood for all of the richness.< /review>

Best ramen in Los Angeles if thick and meaty is your style. They need to change the music in the worst way.< /Review>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Tsujita’s smaller, less fancy, much fattier sister store across the street, I always thought Tsujita Annex was there for people to get ramen without the long waits and short operating hours of Tsujita ramen.

After my last visit there, I realized that the line here is probably just as long as Tsujita proper now, but it definitely does have it’s own taste, and I sometimes feel like I crave the fattier, satisfying taste of Tsujita Annex’s ramen.

I definitely think everyone should take the time to try both Tsujita and Annex at least once, because although they share in name, all the different types of ramen really do taste much different, and the prices are about the same. Definitely add some of the red peppers if you’re not afraid of a little spice! They definitely add a kick!</text>< Pics>

<Review>Tsukemen ramen, you are so damn good!
I love dip ramen! Rich flavors, thick noodles had the perfect chewiness texture, and plenty of tender pork. Can't believe it took me this long to finally try it.

I was so stuffed halfway through my meal that I had to give away half of my noodles and some meats.

Tsujita is now my favorite place to go for ramen.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

After hearing great things about Tsujita on different web sites I thought I'd give it a try.  Came for lunch on a Friday afternoon at around 11:30am.  The place was nearly full already but I got a spot along the back wall.  Had the tonkotsu ramen with the egg ($15 - a little pricey for a bowl of soup but I got the fully loaded option).  I am not a ramen connoisseur by any means but I enjoyed my meal.  Apparently the marquee item is the tsukemen noodle dipping experience but I'm allergic to seafood so it's a no-go for me.

Service was super friendly and I didn't have to wait too long for my food.  When I walked out just after 12noon there were at least 20 people in line.  Overall I'm glad I tried Tsujita and I enjoyed my meal and would recommend to others but I'd be more inclined to try a new place before going back.< /text>

I'll be honest here. I came to this restaurant because I'm a huge fan of Jonathan gold. Typical Ramen in Los Angeles is pork broth and if it's a place closer to West Hollywood perhaps include vegetable broth. Fortunately the only place that I actually used fish broth, which I've learned was the traditional way of normal Ramen, is nowhere to be found in Los Angeles. So I had to still remain with pork broth even though I am banned from eating pork.but like Bill says in "King of the Hill", "I can't join a religion that restrict my diet." From a hose or this way and there's nothing good labor feel shame up and I do like all food. Any case when I approach this restaurant I was expecting more the same regardless of my admiration for jungle, the only Pulitzer Prize winning food critic which I think you one while he was working at the LA weekly and I would be before he sold out to Valley times… Again! Back on topic, the broth is very fulfilling it is thick it is delicious it does not have the smell of pork or pork fat I guess lard but I don't know the exact definition of lard, and the noodles are very much thick and fulfilling and chewy that you really enjoy it rather than feeling like you just bought a cuppa noodle at a restaurant. Oy vey! Now this with the diet that is all oily it's fatty but and it was overwhelming but in a good way so I have to say that I came out of very happy person and it deserves to have the long lines.<//Text>

<text>After seeing all the raving reviews, I decided to stop by to try the infamous Tsukemen. I am definitely a believer! I ordered the Char Siu Tsukemen not knowing that the broth already contained pieces of char siu in it. I was super hungry but it still ended up being too much food for me! I still ate it all though nonetheless. :) We came here when it opened and there was already a line! Arrive early if you don't like to wait. CASH ONLY!

NAY-- I wanted to try the sauces before adding them to my food so I poured some on to a spoon...found a bug in the tsukemen sauce. :X< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<name>Melanie Huynh</name><date>1422297683551<//date><Rating>3< /Rating><text>Having lunch here was actually unintentional. We originally intended on getting Tsujita Annex, where we're regulars. However, the wait for Tsujita Annex was 30+ minutes. We noticed that for once Tsujita LA had no line, so we decided there's a first for everything. We wondered across the street and were seated right away. I had pretty high expectations for this place since so many have raved about their delicious tsukemen.

I ordered the Ajitama Tsukemen (tsukemen with seasoned boiled egg). The tsukemen comes with a bowl for the noodles and a separate smaller bowl with the broth. I was disappointed that my broth was just lukewarm and had no spiciness to it. The broth was really rich (a little too rich in my opinion) and savory with bits of pork in it. The thickness of the broth was too gross for me to really enjoy it and should only be used to dipped the noodles. The noodles weren't has thick as the noodles at Tsujita Annex, but came with a lime wedge and a piece of nori. In my opinion the tsukemen here is nothing compared to the tsukemen that is offered across the street. At least now I can say I've tired this Tsujita, but I won't be coming back as long as Tsujita Annex is open.< /text>< Pics>

< review>
I watched a documentary on Netflix where they had Tsukemen in Tokyo and I immediately wanted to have some. There's no other place in LA that's better known for their Tsukemen than Tsujita so my boyfriend and I made our way to Sawtelle in crazy traffic just to sample some.

I had heard that the wait on weekends can be pretty bad here and I can see why. The place is tiny. They did open the Tsujita Annex diagonally across the street but I have yet to peek in there. Since it was a weekday, we were able to grab the last 2 spots at the counter.

I had the Tsukemen while my boyfriend had the char siu ramen. I didn't care for the broth on their regular ramen too much. I prefer richer darker broth.

As for the Tsukemen, when I had the first bite, I was a little overwhelmed by the intense bonito flavor of the broth. It was very seafood-y. However, after I added lime to the noodle as recommended, the flavor balanced out extremely well. I thoroughly enjoyed my ramen to the last bite.

The restaurant is cash only. Parking used to be a pain but they have free valet parking with validation now. It's located behind the building.<//review>

I had never been in this restaurant before because I always thought It was going to be like the other Tsujita restaurant.

One day I felt curious and I went to the Tsujita Annex. What was my sorprise when I saw the menu was different...

I'm a very fan of tsukemen so I decided to try it. Totally different to the other Tsujita's restaurant tsukemen but really, really good. Maybe I prefer the other one but this one is also incredible.

Please, if you like ramen or tsukemen, whatever Tsujita restaurant is your place!! You are not going to be disappointed never!</Text>

While their ramen is quite tasty, it is their tsukemen that is their go to experience. Without going into detail, it is noodles served with a fantastic thick soup base in which you use as a dip for the noodles. There are instructions to enjoy the tsukemen in 3 stages printed on the menu. The friendly staff will again remind and explain the eating process after the food is served. Parking here is tough but if you don’t mind walking you can find some down one of the streets in the neighborhood, just mind the posted parking signs. This is a popular place so get ready to wait; this is a small restaurant with limited seating.< /review><userid>115643364233017479482<//userid><user_name>Wayne C< /user_name>< Time>

I love this place. It feels like I have been teleported to some Japanese izakaya and given a potpurri of options to chose from all at a very affordable price. A lot of subtle touches makes this place stand out from the insane amount of other izakayas. Overall one of my favorite places to eat authentic Japanese food.<//Text>

First things first, you gotta know that the broth of the tsukemen and ramen is different than that of the Annex across the street. Lines are long, so I don't recommend going with a group bigger than 3. I went with a group of 8 and ended up waiting for 45 minutes even though our wait time was estimated to be only 20.

If you're coming here, try the tsukemen. The broth is more of a sauce that you dip the bouncy thick al dente noodles in. Get the 2nd option with the seasoned soft boiled egg. Squeeze the limes onto the soup to combat the dense fishy broth. At the end, ask for more broth (the actual soup) to dilute the dense sauce. Bring it home, and buy some ramen noodles from Nijiya to have yourself another meal ;)

I've tried the ramen, as well as the dons and I have to say that nothing compares to the tsukemen. The ramen broth was alright, but I hate the thin noodles that they use. I want my noodles to have a bite to them! The dons (Rice bowls) are $4 if you add them onto your entree, $6 otherwise.

How this differs from Annex: I can't finish a bowl of tsukemen because of how intensely fishy the broth is. I have as many friends who disagree and don't taste the fishiness as those who agree with my sentiments. I say taste the tsukemen from both restaurants. You can't go wrong with Tsujita!</text>

Before you walk in the door, take note of the odor that exudes from this establishment. It's a mixture of dirty gym socks and old wet clothes that haven't been transferred to the dryer for weeks. The rancid smell did not go unnoticed, but based on the Yelp reviews, we assumed that the smell must be coming from elsewhere, so we proceeded with caution.

They have two main Ramin options here - Tsukemen and Tonkotsu. The latter, the Tonkotsu, is a "specialty broth" that they make in house. There were four of us at dinner, three of us ordered a version of the Tonkotsu.

When the food arrived, the putrid smell overtook our table. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I tasted the soup; however, it tasted just as badly as it smelled.

I knew immediately that I wasn't interested in eating another bite. When we politely requested an exchange, the manager, Shanon, was called over by our waitress. He rudely told me that they didn't offer any "refunds or exchanges." I explained this wasn't a refund, because I had not eaten the soup. It was literally unstirred, chives still sitting on top of the rotten broth. After arguing for a few minutes with the manager, he was unwilling to remove this item from our bill. We paid for the items that were eaten with cash and proceeded to walk out the of the restaurant. We were literally chased out by the manager, telling us the cops were called and that we had to wait. This manager, Shanon, got in our face, tried to take picture of us on his cell phone, and stood behind our car so we couldn't leave. It was a frightening and appalling experience for four young girls.

I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you read many of the one-star reviews below, they all have the same thing in common, the disgusting odor. The service was so bad, that I would personally rather pay for you to eat lunch anywhere but here.

PS. I attended this establishment with a friend who is 50% Japanese, who had enjoyed Ramin countless times before. She too agreed the Ramin was inedible.< /text>

My all time favorite ramen spot. I initially fall in love with this joint when they came to Mitsuwa in Cost Mesa as a popup restaurant for like a week way before Tsujita had a physical location in US. I liked their tsukamen so much that I came back to have the  ramen like 3 times during that week span. I had no idea Tsujita will arrive in west LA. My first physical store experience was actually bad. I tried both their tsukamen and tonkotsu ramen and they were beyond salty and they were horrible. This was few years back. Luckily I gave this place another try and I've been coming back ever since. I tried dipping ramen in so many other places but no ramen places remotely come close to Tsujita. The porkiest dipping broth that's been simmered for 72 hours and that tender noodle hit my spot every time. I cannot express enough love for this place.</review>

<Review>The best tsukemen I've ever had and some of the best ramen noodles in LA.

I always walk by this corner and see a ridiculous line at lunch (they only serve ramen at lunch). I was extra hungry and took my lunch break at 12:45 instead of 1 and there happened to be a free seat at the ramen bar so I knew this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

They have two options for ramen: Tsukemen (dipping) and traditional tonkotsu. From there you can choose chashu pork, no meat, eggs, etc. They also have some other rice dishes, but this artisan noodle stand is famous for the ramen so I went with the Chashu tsukemen.

My order came out quickly- they gave a generous portion of noodles and pork and a bowl of thick, saucey broth with a salty and perfectly gooey egg, bamboo shoots, and some pieces of meat. They also give you free lime and you can customize your broth with ginger, spice, tonkotsu sauce, and tsukemen sauce. The ramen was thick like spaghetti, firm and a little chilled. At first I dipped the noodles in the broth too long and it was way too salty. After swiftly swishing the noodles, I found the perfect balance between noodles and soup. The broth tasted even better after I ground some sesame seeds and added a little lime and tonkotsu sauce. The broth is what makes this place stand out from other ramen stands: they brew it for 60 hours with a wide variety of flavors that all combine to create an amazing savory sensation.

My only complaint is the price, a bowl of chashu tsukemen will run $15 without tip, but I was very satisfied with my meal and extra noodles and soup are only $1.50. Cash only. This place does live up to its hype and is simply a great ramen stand.</Review><pics>None</pics>< date>

<Time>1426113178090</Time><Review>A much-belated review: After being thwarted at the regular Tsujita (they were closed filming a TV show or something) I noticed the Annex across the street and thought I'd give it a shot. I didn't even know this place existed, but I'm so glad I it was there! It was around 2pm-ish so the wait was minimal, thank goodness--I guess it can get kind of nutty, judging from the other reviews. It's a small but comfortable place, with clean modern (but not sterile) decor. I was a little surprised upon reading the menu--it was a lot more Chinese-influenced than what I was expecting. I got the regular ramen with the soft boiled egg and the Ikura (salmon roe) bowl. I was intrigued by the Tsukemen but wasn't in the mood for it at that moment. This ramen is definitely different than the standard Japanese ramen--it's much more bold and rich, with thick, curly, chewy noodles--yum! I can see why maybe some people wouldn't care for it, but it suited my Korean palate very well, especially with extra garlic and spicy seasonings. The Ikura bowl was good, with fresh roe and rice. Nothing mind-blowing but exactly what I was expecting so it satisfied. I was very full at the end of the meal, but knew I wanted to come back sooner than later. I need to try the tsukemen next time!</Review>< user_id>

Pros:
- creamy broth (so rich so delicious)
- dipping noodles for dinner (I think the original Tsujita only has this for lunch)
- tonkatsu ramen (I liked it better than the dipping ramen)

Cons:
- tiny tiny tiny restaurant means long wait for seating
- difficult to find parking
- pricey, especially if you choose add-ons (egg, green onions, seaweed, etc.)

Bottom line: I believe that a good bowl of ramen should be hearty and include an egg and other garnishings. If it's your first time, and you're feeling adventurous for tsukemen, try to get your friend to order tonkatsu ramen just in case you don't like the dipping style. That's how I ended up eating all of my dad's tonkatsu ramen and none of my dipping ramen...<//review>

<Text>*Thumbs up*
After a 2-hour sweaty hike at Peters Canyon, my wife and I made the 1-hour long drive to LA just to have ramen here. It was definitely a spontaneous thing, because I was craving ramen and I kept seeing Tsujita popping up in reviews.

Luckily we got to Tsujita just shortly after the 11am opening time, because by the time we left the place was crawling with people waiting outside. Of course, I had to have the $14 bowl of tsukemen... and for my first time, it was pretty awesome. Having the two separate bowls was a bit odd at first, but it came natural after a few slurps and honestly it made the ramen eating experience that much more fun.

Both the noodles are broth are #1 in my book, thus far. The noodles had a great chew and consistency, and just perfectly sucked up the broth. The broth is very thick (viscous is the fancy word being thrown around) and heavily concentrated in flavor. Although it was mostly pork based, the broth is just so heavy that the lime squeeze on the noodle is essential to cut through it all.

The chashu is more of the thick cut variety with the layers of white fat still visible. I thought it tasted great, especially after dipping it in the broth. The neon orange, ooey gooey yolk from the egg was just #yolkporn at its finest. Yes, that was a hashtag.

*Thumbs down*
Yep, $14 for a bowl of ramen is pretty darn high and I think the highest I've ever paid for a bowl of ramen. I think this tsukemen is fine for the occasional splurge. Taking it easy on the arteries and the wallet, I can't imagine eating it on a regular basis. Cash only is irksome -- it's not like this place is dirt cheap. They need to get with the times and accept credit card.<//Text><userid>110742205096982467567< /userid>< GmapID>

The wait wasn't bad, about 30-45 mins on a Sunday afternoon. The shops around the area are fun to browse while you're waiting.

My friend and I both tried the tonkatsu ramen. OMG dat broth. So fatty, sooo GOOD. The char siu was also amazingly tender and delicious. The only con was the egg was a little overcooked. But I'll overlook that in this case, since the rest of the bowl was pure perfection. Best ramen I've had so far.

I will definitely be back, especially to try the Tsukemen next time!

This restaurant is a must if you are in the area for lunch, as they only serve the tsukemen ramen for lunch.

Get the tsukemen ramen with char siu pork! (I think it was $14. worth it!)

It comes with two bowls:
- one bowl with thick cold noodles, seaweed, lime, and thick slices of pork
- one bowl of thick broth with chunks of pork and the hidden treasure boiled egg ;)

I first took a sip of the broth.  It was very salty o_o
BUT... once you squeeze some lime on the noodles, dip some noodles in the broth then pull them out, it is so delicious :O !!!!

Despite what it looks like, it is a heavy meal.  The noodles are soooo good!  They have the right thickness so that when they are coated with the rich broth, the balance of salt and acidity with the lime is perfect.  The lime adds some freshness to the meal.

The pork slices are thick, and you really feel like you're getting a lot of meat with your meal.  My friend ordered extra char siu because he thought it would not be enough... but it was definitely enough meat without the extra plate.  Plus there's chunks of meat in the broth already!

Last but not least... beautiful egg.  I love you, egg.

PS: Line gets long.  Park in the residential streets.. or valet is available too.< /text>

I recently went to Tsujita for the first time as per a friends recommendation. The main feature of this place, as the name suggests is its noodles. As my friend informes me, they are now serve noodles every evening, which apparently they weren't before. What I had was the Tsukemen style ramen which is noodles on the side and ramen broth on a separate bowl for dipping the noodles into. The noodles are served cold and the broth hot. Because the noodles are cold, the broth eventually cools down. Unlike hot cooked noodles served in the magma hot broth, these noodles aren't crazy hot, so they are generally great in any weather, where's the magma hot ramen is more desirable during cold days, though not that hot weather stops me from eating any kind of ramen.
Over all, the noodles were good, the broth was thick and rich. I will definitely Tsujita again. Waits can be long, so be prepared.< /review>

I visited Tsujita for its famed ramen noodles when it was still just the new kid on the Little Osaka block. But honestly, I haven't been back since b/c the ramen at Tsujita just isn't as good as the competition. If possible, the ramen broth was TOO thick and not as drinkable as Daikokuya's or Santouka ramen. You might be better off visiting the Annex location across the street which does serve up a pretty impressive bowl of noodles.</text>

The Best Place to get Tsukemen in LA! I promise! :)

After my trip to Japan, I've realized that this is as close as you can get to authentic tsukemen. If you never had it before, you're in for a treat. Tsukemen is basically just dipping noodles. You get a bowl of thick noodles where you dip into a bowl of thick pork broth. So good!

They even have a step-by-step menu that describes how to properly eat your tsukemen.

Order the Char Siu Tsukemen ($13.95) and you will not be disappointed. You get 5 big pieces of char siu. The portions are pretty big and I can never finish a bowl.

I love coming here on the weekdays because the wait is shorter than the crazy long lines you see on the weekends.

FYI, you can only order it during lunch-time. And it's cash only.</text>

Excellent Ramen, never had this dipping noodle style before, and I call myself a Ramen lover… disgraceful until now. Definitely any ramen fan should make the drive to get. You must try the TSUKEMEN (Dipping Noodle) Ramen with a reasonable amount of their ONIKASU (Red spice) it makes a world of difference.

Service: Excellent very friendly and professional always greeted, when you enter and thanked when you finish paying. Pretty standard I know, but hey! must be acknowledged.

Location: Well its LA so parking is always kind of a battle, I recommend you find a spot on the residential area a block down the street. If you have a big party, prepare to wait. They don’t take reservations nor hold spots, you will only be seated if everyone in your party is present.<//review>

Living in the South Bay, I'm spoiled by all of the great ramen places a short drive away. I heard great things about Tsujita LA, so I made the trek to West LA and it was well worth the drive. I ordered the ajitama tsukemen, which was the best iteration of this dish that I have tried. The noodles had the perfect texture and the broth was rich and deep with pork and umami goodness. The egg was cooked to a perfect soft-medium. I tasted some of the tonkotsu ramen that my friend ordered and I can say the broth is one of the best I have tried. It has a deep pork flavor with a subtle sweetness that takes it over the top. If you love ramen, this destination has to be on your short list.< /review>

They serve different food than the Tsujita across the street, and I personally think it's a lot worse.  Expensive too, so don't go to this one, not worth it.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Soup base is great and thick pork dissociation stock
The bean sprouts are full at all
The dough is thick and not bad
Food is a bit slow
It ’s not easy to eat when it ’s full
Decent and overall good

湯底很棒很厚實的豬肉解離高湯
豆芽菜靠背多根本滿出來

<text>(Translated by Google) delicious! I am very grateful to be able to eat tsukemen in the United States.
It's an image of thick seafood tsukemen, but it was lighter than I expected.
Tsukemen regular size, comic 24 dollars... It's a loss price so it can not be helped, but Japan is cheap.

美味い！アメリカでつけ麺食べれるのはとてもありがたい。
魚介濃厚つけ麺、というイメージだけど、思ったよりはあっさりしていた。

Japanese noodles have been eaten a lot. Japan has tried from the south to the Beidou. LA also has a lot of delicious noodle restaurants. This is a chain store with guaranteed quality.
First select the noodles at the counter and add the trolley to the cashier to pay, which is very fast.

自从开业以来没有机会进去，外面总是排队，年轻人喜欢的地方。
日本面条吃的很多了日本从南到北斗尝试过，LA也就不少好吃的面馆，这家是连锁店，品质有保证。
先在柜台选择面条在自己加上小车到收银员付款，速度很快的。</text><user_id>101432864683103136284</user_id><Name>舒为群< /Name><rating>4< /rating>< time>

(Translated by Google) Sawtelle, a city of Los Angeles, called "Small Osaka", Tsujita LA opened three noodle shops and a sushi restaurant on the same street in Sawtelle. It is simply a road tyrant. We come here and open at 11 o'clock, 11: 10 will line up. (I heard that since the opening in 2011, I have been lined up every day.) The 60-hour-boiled fish-bone soup is made with rough noodles. It may be because we don’t pronounce zu zu zu when we eat noodles. It’s really not good. The surface is too hard, the soup is too oily, only the egg is OK.

(Original)
Sawtelle, 一个叫"小大阪"的洛杉机日本城，Tsujita LA在Sawtelle 同一条街上开了3家面店和一家寿司店，简直就是路霸，我们慕名前来，11点钟开门，11:10 就要排队。（听说从2011年开张以来，每天都在排队）粗面加60小时炖出的鱼介琢骨汤头，可能因为我们吃面时不会发出zu zu zu 声,真的不怎么样。面太硬，汤太油，只有那只蛋还可以。</Review>

(Translated by Google) Likes and dislikes seem to be covering up.
It's really delicious, but at the same time, I can't eat it until the end.
The party I came with is really delicious and I want to come again.
The staff was friendly... When you wonder what Tsukemen is, it's good to come and know your taste...! If the weighting is long, but it is more than 2 waiting lists in front, it is also recommended to go somewhere else.

(Original)
호불호가 가리는 듯 하다.
엄청 맛있긴한데 동시에 돼지 누린내가 나서 끝까지는 못먹음.
같이 온 일행은 엄청 맛있어하고 또 오고싶어함.
직원이 친절했음... 츠케멘이 뭔지 궁금할때 와보고 자기의 취향을 알아가기 좋음...! 웨이팅이 긴편인데 앞에 2 웨이팅리스트 이상이면 그냥 다른곳을 가는것도 추천 ㅎ 굳이 기다릴 필요는...< /text>

(Translated by Google) Although I don't really like ramen noodles in the first place, I sometimes "suddenly get nervous" and really want to eat it - I will do it today. But if I have a choice, I generally prefer to choose tsukemen.
This is definitely a popular ramen/tsukemen shop, and it’s so long. Order the dipping noodles ($17.95). It is said that the pork bone soup is cooked for over 60 hours.
According to the recommendations, there are three ways to eat dipping noodles. First, dipping noodles in the original soup is the normal way of eating. After eating 2/3, add some lime to dip the noodles 👉 I haven't tried this kind of food method, but it's all right, a few fresh. In the end, I add the remaining dipping sauce to the soup and drink it 👉 I personally feel that the taste is really strange, just taste it 😆.
Overall very satisfied. The noodles are springy, the soup is rich, and the taste is different from Japanese food. It is definitely a high-scoring choice!

(Original)
雖然其實我本來就唔係特別鍾意食拉麵，但有時都會"突然發神經" 好想好想食 —— 今日就係啦。不過如果有得選擇，我一般會更傾向選擇沾麵。
呢一間絕對係人氣拉麵/沾麵店，人龍成日都好長。 點咗沾麵（$17.95），據說豬骨湯頭係超過60個鐘頭熬製而成。
根據建議，沾麵有三種食法，首先係用原來嘅湯汁沾麵嚟食，即係正常嘅食法。食到2/3之後，就加啲青檸落去沾麵裏面 👉 呢種食法未試過，不過亦都唔錯，幾fresh 。而最後就係將剩下嘅沾麵汁加湯飲用 👉 個人覺得味道實在有啲怪，淺嚐即可 😆。
整體非常滿意。麵條彈牙，湯頭濃郁，味道同日本食嘅冇乜分別，絕對係高分數之選！<//text>

(Translated by Google) This is the mainstream Tsujida. It seems. There is a Tsujida-style ramen shop across the road, but be aware that the concept is different. This is a seafood and there are pork bones! I was aware that.

The thick seafood-based soup and the solid thick noodles are the best. If sour is added, the soup will feel mellow, and if you notice, you will quickly lose your noodles and you will always regret that you didn't make it medium.

It may seem relatively crowded, but if you write a name, the order will come very quickly.
Also, Sudachi can get two if he wishes.

(Original)
こちらが本流のつじ田。らしい。道路挟んだ向かいにつじ田表記のラーメン屋さんがあるけど、コンセプトが異なるのでご注意を。こちらは魚介であちらは豚骨！と自分は認識しておりました。

魚介ベースの濃厚スープとしっかりコシのある中太麺が最高に美味しい…。すだちの酸味が加わるとスープがまろやかに感じられ、気付けばあっという間に麺が無くなってしまい、中盛にしなかったことをいつも後悔してしまう…

比較的混んでいるように見えるかもですが名前書いとけば割とあっという間に順番がくる、はず。
あと、すだちは希望すれば2つもらえる。<//text>

The porridge ramen soup is rich but not overly greasy, plus a small spicy taste, it is refreshing and not greasy. The newly released grapefruit bubble water is also delicious and refreshing, which is very suitable for matching ramen or noodles.

(Original)
沾麵和拉麵口味都不錯，沾麵麵條有彈性，份量十足，和在日本當地吃到的味道十分接近。豚骨拉麵湯頭濃郁卻不過度油膩，加上小辣提味，吃起來爽口不膩。新上市的柚子氣泡水也很美味清爽，很適合搭配拉麵或沾麵。< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I have a bug in the ramen and I try to share it with other people in the other bowl. I have a bit of a lonely server but I doubt if it is a bug and I want to buy a new ramen. This is the case of what is happening to the other servers, so I gave it to the other server to give a bowl, said that the woman almost ate a new saying, but we were so sorry to have to take this also ㅡ ㅡ Tsukemen delicious, I do not know why you're famous. Do not go.

<Text>(Translated by Google) In the old days, it was also a tonkotsu mania, and checked the American Tsujida. Unfortunately, the whole family had a pretty bad diarrhea and suffered for about 3 days. Once I examined it, I used to have a group food poisoning. There are six friends who are ramen owner, but Tonkotsu soup is difficult to manage, it is also bad in taste and food poisoning is a time issue. Is the US sweeter than Japan? You may see a dead man near you.

昔はトンコツマニアでもあり、アメリカのつじ田をチェック。残念、家族全員がかなり酷い下痢をして、約３日間苦しみました。調べたら、以前も此処は集団食中毒を起こしてました。ラーメン屋オーナーの友人は6人いますが、トンコツスープは管理が困難です、味も悪い上に食中毒では潰れるのは時間の問題。アメリカは日本より基準が甘いのですかね？近く死人が出るかもしれませんね。< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>
