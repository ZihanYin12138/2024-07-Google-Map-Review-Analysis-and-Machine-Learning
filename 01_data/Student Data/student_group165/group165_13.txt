This was my first time at Performance Motor Works. I brought in my E350 Mercedes for maintenance. The entire process was great! Travis was the consummate advisor, walked me through the process and explained what would transpire. They even fixed my bumper (not damaged, just needed to be set back into place). Michael was the mechanic and he did an awesome job. Overall, I am happy with results, liked the communication and how one can follow the mechanic as he progresses through the tasks (all on the cell phone). Thank you!!< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>It’s hard to find a German car shop that is trust worthy in value AND knowledge. But Performance motor works truly does it all!! They are great; very communicative, timely, and the perfect balance of professional and personable! As a young woman I feel way in over my head just taking my car in for an oil change, but here they’ve answered all questions big and small... all in all to wrap it up as long as I have a German car I will be a customer of Performance Motor Works<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I called and made an appointment a couple of days in advance, then dropped my car off at the appointed time. My car was ready to go by 5 PM with lots of care. Travis is very thoughtful and actually has pictures of areas that need repair. Work is always completed promptly and I trust the quality and the pricing. My favorite Mini repair stop.</review>< resp>

They are a great shop to go to and they are super knowledgeable about German automobile's plus they make everything super easy to understand what is wrong with your vehicle they do not try to push anything else on you to buy and are straight forward. They have excellent customer service and keep up to date on everything that they are doing and will be doing to your vehicle and you are never left in the dark about what is going on with your car. All around great shop and guys.< /text>

Nice to have a local mechanic who understands what I wanted when asked about a audi q7 trailer hitch install.  Great 👍 fair prices and they charge by time on job rather than book time.  Simply means if job takes less time than expected you share in the discount!</Review>

Didn’t feel like they were over selling at all, Dan really cared about explaining things clearly and their cost before that work was performed.

I was considering purchasing this BMW 135i and needed expert opinion on the condition of the car.  The service provided was A+!  Due to my timeline, they scheduled me in quickly.  They walked me through what they would inspect and they addressed my concerns. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Their waiting area was clean, cozy and inviting.  They also provided refreshments unlike  most Auto Service places.  Their assessment of the vehicle was vey professional.  I would definitely use them again and would recommend them if asked.< /Text>

<Review>We went in due to a check engine like. After inspection and diagnostic check was thermostat. Got a quote and approved.
Short time later they let me know that part was covered under an extended warranty and BMW should repair it. Very honest business.
We had other work done on the car by PMW. Fair price, professional and kept us informed. I trust them when they say what “needs” to be done and what can wait.
I won’t go anywhere else!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Stopped by to get some G12(pink) coolant for a Mk3 Jetta I had just bought. They came out front and made sure I was going to use the right coolant. Luckily they did because I needed G11(blue). Very experienced and helpful. Fairly expensive shop but you get what you pay for.</Review>

<review>This is my first time trying out this shop.  I chose them because of their positive reviews and the about of reviews. The owner Dan was receptive on what repair I needed on my car and gave me a decent quote for the repair. Another shop was cheaper, but are further away from me and had less reviews. Dan was able to work with me on the price, so I chose his shop. During the work Travis and Dan were able to update me on additional parts needed for the repairs, which I expected, but wasn't looking forward to the additional price. Again Dan worked with me on the price and was able to provide me a courtesy rental vehicle so I can work while they repair my car. Overall great experience. Only complaint I have, which is not a big issue, is the lack a courtesy shuttle service. I will still bring my car back to them for future repairs that I can't or don't feel like doing myself.</review><user>108335717863113677793<//user><Time>1588019376597< /Time>< Rating>

We have had a lot of different services done on my wife's X3 and everything was done with care.  They take their time to diagnose and recommend only what is needed.  They do inspect the entire vehicle and make other recommendations, but never pressure you into them.  Dan and Travis have never steered us wrong (car pun).<//Text>

<Text>this is a professional establishment they use the same processes that I have experienced at a dealership at a fraction of the cost. I was given a grossly overstated price and told I needed something I did not need from Roseville BMW which I characterize as a shady operation every time I go there the customer service is deplorable I prefer Performance Motor Works  hands down.< /Text>< Pics>

Amazing work. Great customer service. Pro wing and costs are transparent. They only fix what needs fixing and always offer options. I first came here about 5 years ago with my new VW that Roseville and Folsom VW couldn’t fix. They referred me here. They nailed it down and the pricing was incredibly fair for the amount  of diagnosing hours that were involved. About 3 years ago I brought my Audi A6 for what I thought was a water pump. They called me and told me it doesn’t need a water pump but instead it was a thermostat. Instead of charging me for unnecessary water pump work they called me to tell me.

Honest mechanics here.</text>

Very nice and professional and SUPER THOROUGH. As soon as they had evaluated my Mini....I got a txt with everything they evaluated, their findings and their recommendations. No pressure to do any of them, but enough detail for me to decide if it was necessary (with the help of my “smarter-than-me” car friends) to do at this time. Very refreshing.<//Text>

Dan made sure to walk through the repairs the shop had done to my car and he also touched base with me even while he was on vacation. There were some hesitations that I had about this shop when I first came in, but that hesitation was quickly turned around. Dan, Travis and the rest of his team have shown that they care deeply about the work they do. If you're looking for great service on your German automobile, I would strongly recommend this shop</Review>< pictures>

Dan and his crew provide outstanding service while keeping the customer comfortable and informed. You don't get just a readout on paper but a full explanation of any current or potential problems including high definition pictures of areas of concern.  The facility is personal yet very up to date and clean, there is also a plush waiting room stocked with beverages. AAA+++  2014 mini cooper s.</Review>

I had to get the trunk wiring harness on my Volkswagen CC Replaced since it is a common issue. They got it all done in one day and even did a complimentary inspection of my whole car. They found a couple of other problems with my car, but it were things that I could easily fix in my garage. They didn't pressure me into paying to perform these services. Really friendly staff, I talked to Travis and he made everything a breeze. I highly recommend them for the DIYer who needs a little bit of professional help.</review>

Just got a Mini and my main concern was finding a great business for maintenance services with helpful and knowledgeable staff. Finally had my first visit here and I’ve got to say that I will not be taking my car anywhere else. Big thank you to the staff!!!</Text>

Several years ago, a friend who works in the auto industry recommended this shop. I decided to try them out and now can say that I have been a customer for several years.

<text>Hats off to these guys! I was selling my 2007 Mini Cooper (5-speed manual) and the buyer was really pushy insisting that the clutch is bad. So I agreed to replace the clutch at my cost. Took it in here, two different mechanics drove the car and confirmed the clutch is in excellent condition with no issues. They even said, "we would love to do the job, but it would be dishonest." They walked away from a $1,500 job but kept integrity. Thank you guys for being honest.

I  LOVE this auto shop! I was referred there by a friend a couple years ago and I couldn't be happier. They are awesome, honest and have great prices. I have two BMW's that only get serviced at this shop, due to the professional work that is done in a timely manner. Won't take my cars anywhere else. LOVE THEM and the work they do!!!<//review>

They keep me posted, they typically are right on the estimate when the final bill comes out and best of all, they do not promise things they can not do.

<pics>None< /pics><Text>Performance has everything you want in an independent shop. They have invested in the specialized equipment and have the knowhow to work on these cars better, in my opinion , than a dealership. I've taken my mini there for 5 years. They are honest, hardworking, knowledgeable guys who don't oversell work, charge a fair price, and stand behind their work. They even gave me free second opinions on needed scope and cost of repairs when I had a breakdown in San Diego and had to have repairs done down there, and I've called them several times on the road for advice when there have been problems.< /Text>< gmapID>

I can't say enough good things about Performance Motor Works!  I recently took my Audi in for a CV boot/axle repair and it now runs great again.  Over the last year or so I have used Performance Motor Works three times and primarily worked with Dave.  Every time I call or bring my vehicle in, I am treated with excellent customer service and professional expertise.

Performance Motor Works truly works with you in order to repair your vehicle in the most cost effective, high quality manner.  The workmanship of the techs is always excellent.

In sum, I absolutely recommend giving Performance Motor Works your business.  I have used many auto shops over the years and do not plan on switching from Performance Motor Works as long as I'm living in the area!</review>

I scouted out 3 different non-dealer BMW service places during our last year of factory service, and I picked PMW.  I have been happy with these folks since 2013.  We have two BMW's now, Honest, timely, quality work.  Easy to work with.  It's a winner.< /text>

I have never had service done here, but as a tow truck driver, I have towed cars 50+ miles just to come here. That says a lot about a shop. Especially when that tow was from a customer's house in Galt. There are 3 dealers between Galt and Rocklin.</Text>

Dan and Dave and PMW are the best   Reliable and excellent service always. In  over 15 years of caring for my 3 cars never a problem. Thank you very much!!  As a woman I know I can rely on their judgement and not take Advantage of my “no knowledge” of Cars.  Thank you!<//Text>

I've been taking my BMW's to PMW for over 15 years. Dan provides the best all around customer experience. Honest diagnosis, repairs are timely, costs are reasonable and their mechanics do quality work. I'll be a customer for life.<//Text>

<Review>My wife and I have been going to Performance for over 15 years. We started with them when our original warranty epired. They have cared for our 1999 528i which now has over 330,000 miles and have always gone the extra mile in the service they provide. I recommend Dave and Dan without reservation to anyone interested in keeping their BMW running its' best now and for many years to come.<//Review>< Response>

We are so pleased with the work and expertise we receive at PMW.  Both Dave and Mike are knowledgeable and friendly.  It is very easy to get an appointment, so you don't have to wait too long either.  They have the service of a dealer, but their prices are a welcome relief. We were referred by friends to take care of my car, a 2001 and now my husband takes his car in too.  If you haven't been here, you have to give them a try; you will not regret it.< /text>

My M5 was taken to PMW and he took the time to thoroughly explain to me what needed to be done "now" and what could "wait" until later.  I truly appreciated his honesty!  When I picked my car up it was fixed when they said it would be and ran perfectly! Great job PWM!!!<//review>< rating>

My kids both drive older BMWs.  Performance has always done an excellent job whenever we have needed to have the cars worked on.  They are very reasonably priced and professional.  Dave goes out of his way to provide excellent customer service.
I highly recommend this shop.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I began using the services of Performance Motor Works earlier this year and my experiences with them have been outstanding. Working with and speaking directly to the owners of the company, Dave & Mike, makes a difference. They show a high level of expertise and customer service. On one occasion when the diagnoses showed a problem with the emission system, rather than fix it and charge me, they informed me of CA's extended emission warranty and sent me back to the dealership to get it repaired under warranty. On another occasion, when I rolled in with a fairly minor request, they provided a quick fix free of charge and sent me on my way with a smile. What an unexpected “Wow!”

I like doing business with fair and honest people whom I can rely on and trust. I will gladly continue to do business with Mike and Dave!<//review>< pictures>

<review>I’ve been here 2 times. This most recent time was back in December or so. The second time they ended up charging me $40 to change a bulb plus scratched my car they told me they would take care of it and they never called or contacted me again. Also my car never leaked any oil before now it does, so I’m going to assume the lack of care for my car means they put the wrong oil in, oh yeah and they never put my under carriage back on.</review><pics>None<//pics><date>1521179473814< /date><UserId.>100431687136077962106<//UserId.><Rating>1< /Rating></record>

< Review>
Crooks. I took my car here for their "free 2nd opinion" took 3 days, turns out they couldn't check anything without 3 hours diagnostic time at almost $400. Even though the ad clearly states they will double check any previous estimate. I have a 545i SMG and when I gave the guy my key he walked to a 90s bmw, but they only make 545i in 2004-05. Last time I brought my car in they quoted me $7700 to fix a bunch of BS. I got it all done for $2100 at BMW of Beverly Hills. They said my coolant pipe was gone, turned out they were wrong it was the coolant case at the back of tranny. They said my valve covers needed replacement, turned out it a sensor leaking. they said my tranny was slipping, turns out it was a bad clutch. They said I had electrical issues causing o2 sensor check engine light to falsely display, turns out it was the o2 sensor heaters. They said I needed all lower control arms bushings, fortunately they got that one right lol. Take your car to EU Tech on Auburn or Andrews Automotive, honest and top rated.</Review>

Great staff and service! Their chicken is what is making me leave a review... it tastes like grilled chicken... both the kung pao and mushroom. I'm in the middle of some, I'll definitely choose this location going forward.<//text>

<Text>Went out of way to get here before they closed, showed up at 9:08 and they were closed. I had googled the hours and it said La Mesa closing time is 930.  NO , that was grossmont mall in La Mesa that closes at 930. This is only one of 2 Pandas that's closed by 9 ,most close at 1030. This is just prejudice against minorities because were likely to be ones stuck working swing shifts and will never be able to make it before this early closing time.</Text><gmapID>0x80d957224e70a6fb:0x4c1c4816e0f3e10c<//gmapID><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

Service is ok but for some reason the string bean chicken breast I had was extra salty. And the orange chicken felt rubbery. It still tasted good though. But I couldn't eat the first entree.</Review>

There is always fresh hot food ready to go. I was a little bit upset that I wasn't asked if I wanted condiments or told thank you. The cashier also never smiled. However the food was delicious as always.<//Text>

<text>I work with adults with disabilities and a couple of my guys and myself went here on a outing to buy lunch, it was two of my clients who weren't buying and the lady was soooo rude!!!! She tells us "if you aren't buying you can not eat here I'm running a business" OK, understandable we would've taken our business elsewhere. But there is a way to talk to people and you DO NOT point your finger in someone's face. There was another customer in there who asked what the problem was when it was empty so she told us to sit our people in a corner like they're children. I just think if things were handled different it could've been better. But to keep my consumers from experiencing discrimination we won't be bringing them there anymore.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This might be more of a rant about basic customer service. when customers are lined up at the counter don't stop taking their orders to work on four online or phone in orders.  Help the folks standing right in front of you and let one of the five employees fill the orders.<//Text>

decent portions. staff was friendly. the rice was old but the chow main looks fresh. a lot of choices were close to empty and i couldn't tell if they were going to be refilled but it didn't look like it. i normally get Beijing beef but it was gone so i went with Angus steak and orange chicken. both were good but the orange chicken tastes like it might have been sitting for a while, probably due to low customers in the location.</text>

When I walked inside Panda’s it was comfortable and the workers were just as nice as my Hawaii Panda’s. Of course I got my favorite choices— half fried rice, half chow mein, mushroom chicken and teriyaki chicken. Same familiar dishes made me feel like I was home.

<review>It's sad that this place has become so commercialized and it seems that they really only care about the bottom line and the dollar now. The quality of the food is gone , the portion size has gone down and it seems that they are just using too much filler in their dishes now. This used to be my favorite Chinese food in town and now it seems I am just constantly being disappointed when I go there.< /review>< Pics>

I love panda, I eat it all the time. With that being said this is the WORST one I've been to! Food is ALWAYS COLD OR COOKED WRONG! I work in this parking lot and am really bummed  this place is so bad because I would probably eat it every single day. Hopefully they get it fixed</Text>

Chicken is always dry. The soda machine is never Working. I visited twice in a month, both times the machines were not working. Today it was working, but with No ice. Is it really that hard to just run into Vons next door, and get a couple of bags of ice and pour it in the machine. I guess their heads would catch on fire if they tought that hard.< /Text>

<Review>I've been coming to this place for a long time  and nothing changed  so I decided to rate  this place........This place is very clean do to the fact that the owner's/manager's present are litterally next to the employee's always looking at them and giving them the Evil look to make sure The food portion are   as little as posible:( Very Dissapointed!!!!</Review>< response>

Only place I buy orange chicken. It's really good.  I used to also buy crispy noodles in the bag. They changed the recipe and the ones they sale now are not as good.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Super eatery with freshly made food that is prepared in front of you, is clearly a must in the states, at least for us.

I attended a screening of the documentary, Be Natural, directed by Pamela Green here. This was my first time at the Harmony Preview House and I was pretty impressed. The theater had ample seating and great quality sound and picture. My only gripe, as noted in another review, are the chairs. I am 5'4" and I found myself adjusting my seat every few minutes or so because I couldn't get comfortable. The seats are on the older side and made from cloth. The only perk was that the aisles were pretty wide so people were able to pass by with ease. Overall, it's a cute little venue for private events and I'd come back if invited.< /Text>

It is a clean and well managed theater.
It also has a great sound system and screen. The seats are good. No food or beverages allowed.<//text>

<Review>Amazing food!!!
Husband and I love this restaurant. We've tried most of their plates and they are delicious (burrito, soft tacos, tacos dorados, gorditas, menudo and so on). Today we had the famous "costillitas con nopales en salsa de chipotle" (pork ribs with cactus in chipotle sause). Suuuper goooood!! And the best service. You should also try my favorite agua fresca, "agua de alfalfa con limón", it is very refreshing.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYZAfUT4R3sBELm4uDO4xR8aREyDvBII6Jsp_O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<review>For some reason the overall quality and quantity of the meals I've purchased was excellent for over a year now but,
As of the past couple of months it's gotten less and less of a desirability.
With 0 sour cream as to it's previously being included as well as their chicken quesadillas had literally 1-2 pieces on each 1/4 sliced with stail over cooked, crunchy flour tortillas with an overall undisirabiliry eatable experience upon my most recent experience-dining/lunch-meal< /review><response>None< /response>< date>

<Text>This place has been one of my favorites since it opened up. I love the chicken tacos, my favorite though is a double bacon cheeseburger combo for $8.50 can't be that! On top of the price it's fantastic and fresh food!:)
Highly recommended!<//Text>< pictures>

The food here is excellent. Always fresh and clean tasting. The area around the restaurant isn't great, but it's worth the trek over. Get the chicken taquitos or nachos! Yumm<//review>

<Text>My family & I have been coming here for years! Always consistently good and high quality! The donuts are fresh and not greasy at all. The sandwiches are to die for! We love them so much that we always get their sandwich platters for parties and they always give us free donuts to go with! You will be blown away once you try their sandwiches...and I think they make their own pickles too!<//Text><Time>1614625207354</Time>< userid>

Been there a few times when working in the area and we all like it so much. Grinders and donuts are so good. I work with picky people but they all love the food from Mikels. Very friendly there and the prices are pretty good, especially compared to other places. Definitely are "lunch spot" when in the area.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I have eaten at this restaurant for so many years. It is hands down my favorite sandwhich shop. I am sure they make their own delicious bread. It is always soft, chewy with little bit of crumb/crunchiness on the outside. I would always order extra veggies  including pickles and then I found out they sell their delicious pickles. I always make it a point to get a whole pickle now. Veggies are always fresh. My sub of choice is a simple turkey with provolone and avocado. I have gotten a capicola sub before but the turkey is by far the best. I will always come here for delicious sandwhichs.< /Text>< pictures>

Horrible, who gave them 5 stars? Who is smoking crack and reviewing restaurants ? I had to give $30 worth of food to my dog because i trusted reviews on Google maps. Never again. You might as well buy Banquet Frozen Dinners for better quality food. I mean seriously.</Text>

If you are close to the Fontana area  eat here is a small very clean place , the ladys working here are very courteous and make the best sandwiches ever.
If you are like me that I don't like to eat meat every day the avocado veggie is the best option.< /Text>

<Review>We've tried coming 3 times to this place once they closed early and the other two times they didn't even have any doughnuts.. It was 5 hours before closing and they weren't even willing to Make more they were going to sell us the nasty hard ones that have been sitting there for hours.. not even willing to give us some kind of discount didnt even gave a big variety of doughnuts. Such horrible service completely disappointed in this place.</Review>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) Today 02/27/19. 6:20 in the morning I stopped to buy donuts and a woman with short hair glasses gave me a bad attitude. She treated me badly, she wanted to give me the donuts she wanted, not the ones I wanted, I told her to give me back my money, what she did, she threw me money, she said unsuitable words ... I do not know why they have her working in that place, I do not recommend it with Cristian I hope and that girl will not continue working in that place !!!

<time>1619160058046</time><Pictures>None</Pictures><name>Kimberly Collins< /name><Review>Pick up Stix is absolutely GREAT. Their rewards program is awesome and easy to use. You really do feel like you're getting rewarded, not humored. I love their wonton soup and bourbon chicken. Their pad thai is also really good. Better than a lot of pad thai offerings in the area. My favorite is their salad dressing. I didn't know till recently you can substitute a small salad for the rice in the lunch specials. Fantastic! And the staff are very friendly and professional at the Escondido store. And prompt. I never have to wait very long, even when I don't order ahead.< /Review><rate>5<//rate>< user_id>

<review>Service here is awesome. Well staffed and friendly. It was everything we’ve come to expect from Pick Up Stix, but I have been disappointed by other locations that, for some reason have really understaffed their locations. There was also plenty of parking. Super clean and smelled really good, too. :-) This is a great location and I just can’t say enough about the staff.< /review>< rate>

The cashier was very helpful explaining the tofu options!   They can make any of their dishes vegetarian.  The tables were all clean.  The manager came by and cleared our trash away for us!  The food was really tasty and fresh!</Text>

When my wife needs a quick fix of some good Asian food, Pick Up Stix is one of her go-tos.

The service at this location is quick and the food is always fresh and delicious.

Pick Up Stix also has a consumer club you can join to get extra discounts and earn free stuff too.

Pick Up Stix is located in the north end of the Escondido Promenade easily gotten to from the 15 just south of the 78 interchange.< /Text>

<review>I am very impressed with the recent service I received from Caesar working the cash register.  When I asked if he was the manager he stated he wasn’t and I truly believe he should be considered for a managerial position. I would leave 6 stars if I could just for my experience! Another plus is that the food is always good here.< /review>< pics>

Came here for lunch as I was passing through and trying to stay away from chain restaurants. And since I've never heard of this place, I thought to give it a shot. And sure glad I did! The food was fresh, made to order, the staff wa friendly. The food didn't take long and tasted great. I ordered the beef broccoli with fried Rangoon. Super delish!<//Review>< pics>

We ordered a tofu dish and they sent us the chicken version instead. Then we called and they refused to rectify the error. The other food we ordered wasn't even good. It tasted like sweet chemicals. Panda Express cooks tastier food for less money. Will not eat here again.< /Review>

The curry chicken with noodles was very tasty with a nice and spicy after taste. Also comes with two cream cheese filled wontons, which were warm and delicious.  Portion size was just right for a senior citizen.</Review>

Always amazing parking is a little tricky but if you're patient or don't mind walking a distance to get that amazing fresh Asian cooking then you won't mind this location. I always order my regular house chicken with extra sauce and it was buy one get one free employees and manager are extremely helpful and attentive always offering me a glass of water while I wait so good at a fast food or quick food restaurant ever,heck I don't even get that good of service when I go to sit down places.</review>

<Text>Used Uber Eats for the first time today and choose to order from here. I was pretty disappointed.  Upgraded to the "chow mein " for an extra $2. It was tan noodles with absolutely no veggies or anything added to it. Not a shred! The amount of chicken they put in my curry chicken and veggie dish was insulting but then once I realized how rubbery all the chicken was, I was relieved.  I have to say this was by far my most disappointing experience at a Pick Up Stix.  Not sure if it had to do with being a to go order.or not but don't think Ill order or visit there again.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Absolute garbage! Food was nasty and full of grease. Literally floating in grease! I'm writing this review from inside this place. The chow main was under cooked as well as all of the vegetables were Bailey steamed just pure crunch. So much so that my cheap plastic fork broke and bent that I had to go get another one! Whose of money and no where half as good as any panda that I've ever been too< /Text>< Pictures>

I'll give this place another try because I like the Ambiance and the service. However the salmon was undercooked and it was quite a wait for the food because they were busy on Sunday afternoon</Text>

Hands down the WORST "food" I've ever had from a restaurant, period. This place doesn't even deserve one star. Save your money and avoid this establishment like the plague .</Review>

< Review>
I was soooo excited to get Chinese food take as I never get the chance to eat it.
The main entree, the house chicken special recommended by girl who took my order was soooo sad. Fatty brown meat and bland. Ate lots of fried rice. Sorry. Not being mean.</Review>

GO NEXT DOOR TO CHIPOTLE!!!
First time I have ever been to a Pick Up Stix and last time, will NEVER go again.
Bland food with the taste of old grease, the Crispy Honey Chicken should have been called the crispy old grease flavored chicken, I asked for the "Upgraded" Chow Mein, I guess that meant cook it in a wok right after you cooked something with peanuts, I had peanuts and remnants of other food in the noodles of whatever was cooked before.
I asked for chow mein with the chicken and said I will pay the difference, now they advertise chow mein as having celery carrots onions and sprouts, I guess they maybe can't read because all I got were some nasty flavored over cooked noodles no veggies.
I got it to go and I was starving, I powered through and choked it down, BIG MISTAKE and my guts are letting me know what a mistake it was.
NEVER AGAIN!!!

Haven't  been here yet, but I'm  hearing wonderful  things! My son has Autism, and we have been to 3 Dental places that will take his money but not give him the treatment for on rootcanel, just because he has to be put to sleep, which I will PAY for. I don't  understand  why I have to DRIVE all the way to Pico, Garden Groove and LA HABRA just for them to say they cannot do much for him!! HELP!! I hope this could be the last phone call I make on Monday, I just want my son to be Happy n Healthy< /review>

My son was recently in Loma linda hospital. All the doctors and nurses treated him soooooo well.Very caring with so much compassion.just can't say enough about this facility. Most of them with a smile on their face & this really helps,Because the majority of all visitors have their love ones sick.. THANKS AGAIN LOMA LINDA. WE APPRECIATED ALL YR KINDNESS</Text>

<review>This was the worst experience ever...staff was horrible and lack of communication from the E.R. Staff , Doctors and the unit i was on. U push your call light and they  tell u someone will be with u and never show up. I had to complain to the charge nurses about the care i received. Loma linda has went down hill. This is one of the worst hospitals now!!!<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

The people here are preoccupied by antiquated religious legalism as well as unprofessional and unethical practices, poor educational services, and  inconsistent medical care.  Take your business elsewhere or you risk being ripped off  big time.  There are a lot of other teaching hospitals and graduate schools without all of the drama and corruption.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>My wife Scharlene is recovering well from complicated abdominal surgery that was done at LLU Heart and Surgical Hospital.  We cannot speak highly enough of the 3 surgeon team of Marcos Michelotti, MD, Carlos Garberoglio, MD and Hahns Kim, MD.  Pre-op consultations ensured that my wife was confident and relaxed before surgery began.
Family members where kept well informed during the over 5 hour operation.
The team of HSH 2100 provided excellent aftercare, it is difficult to single out any individuals but Nurse Joni and Physical Therapist Ben always brightened my wife’s day.  As a visitor I felt welcome and the staff was always ready to answer any questions that I had.
Although LLU is a religious organization we never felt pressured to follow any of the Seventh-day Adventists practices.</review>< username>

< review>
I’ve used these guys a couple times to deliver to my mom (I’m out of state). The two times prior, everything went fine. This third time, though, they forgot to deliver the little cheesecake with the fruit. No biggie, I call and ask if it could be delivered the next day. They said yes. Was it delivered? Nope. They sent me the cost of the cheesecake back. No call, no explanation. Just the money in my account. If I had wanted my money back, I would’ve asked for it back. I wanted it delivered to my mom, that’s why I asked for it to be delivered the next day and told it would be no problem. If it WAS a problem, you could have told me and I would have been bummed but okay. Don’t lie, that’s just unprofessional. I’ll just use the other one across town from now on. Maybe they’ll tell me the truth.<//review>

<Review>Disappointed in their service. I have never ordered from here before, and I order online for an order to be picked up curbside on Mother's Day as a gift for our Pastors wife. I arrive at this location and the number to call curbside is busy the whole time I had to get in this long line of people waiting as well. It took 45 mins to get my prepaid order. Knowing it's a busy time of year, they should have been more prepared. I missed a part of our special Mother's Day service. The bouquet was nice, but was wrapped sloppy. Presentation wasn't it's best.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I could not explain how frustrating it is to know that a Mother’s Day arrangement was not delivered due to the delivery car being “rear ended” so they say and was promised the delivery be made the following day which I agreed. The following day arrived and no delivery, no call from the company nothing at all. Apparently this place has a reputation of lying to their customers based on my experience and the previous customer reviews. Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere!<//text>< userid>

<Text>I placed an order, they delivered the wrong thing. I immediately called  at 12:30 after the delivery wherein they said they would deliver the right thing. At 5 pm I called again and they assured me it would come before 9 pm. It never came and the employers essentially lied to me. When you are ordering to be delivered on Valentine's day it is pretty important to actually have it delivered. Don't order from here.< /Text>< resp>

Placed a Anniversary order for my husband in yesterday he never got and they didn't even attempt to do order called this morning because I had a hunch they would try to deliver a late delivery and yup they where I canceled ASAP and they had no idea or reason why it wasn't delivered. Terrible stay away from this disaster, I just read all the reviews I see why.Always read reviews before purchasing.

<review>I placed an order for my mother in law. I normally pick up at store but couldnt thia time so I had it delivered. She received it at almost 6pm with chocolate covered  fruit melting, no balloon or box off candy like I ordered. I called the store and they finally delivered them close  to 7pm. It cost me quite a bit and to be delivered this way was unacceptable!
I was very unhappy n so was my mom in law. They should of been kept refrigerated or in a refrigerated cooler!! So disappointed!< /review></record>

WE ordered an arranagement and bananas on the side. When we were a block away we realized we did not have the bananas and they said that they were on the arrangement!! which was still in the car so we brough it down and they were totally rude about providing a service which we had paid for.< /review>

This was the worst ever! I sent my wife a basket that cost me 89$ for Valentine’s Day, she got it at almost 4:30, the fruit was so hot it fell apart and the bag was full of juice!! She received this at her work and she was embarrassed to get it, the girls at the front desk laughed at it. My gift to my wife was a freakin joke!! This should never have been delivered. She had to put it in the fridge cause it was so freak hot like it was in a car all freakin day!! I have pictures to prove it. Never a customer again Gabriel Mullins!!!< /Text>

Looks like this business has a reputation for horrible customer service and follow through. My husband ordered an arrangement to be delivered to my work on Valentines Day. When he picked me up and saw I didn’t have it, he tried to call and couldn’t get ahold of anyone (at 4:00) in the afternoon. They never returned his call or let him know what the problem was.  It arrived at almost 4:00 the following day - 2 minutes before our office closed. He emailed them to express his displeasure, but obviously customer satisfaction is a zero priority for them because they still haven’t reached out to make this right.  We will not be giving them any business in the future.<//Review>

Unprofessional. Staff talking to someone outside clearly seen me walk in and waiting in the front for 10 minutes before asking me if she could help me. When I wanted to order they told me they pretty much couldnt do anything for me. I get that they were busy but so was the fig location and they were able to help within 20 minutes.<//text>

< Review>
Ruined Valentine's Day surprise! This store completely failed to deliver an arrangement that my husband had pre-ordered in store as a surprise for me on Valentine's day 2018, especially as he had to work. I had always wanted an edible arrangement, and my husband wanted to make sure I knew he remembered. He even told them that if for ANY reason they could not deliver on Valentine's, to let him know and he would personally come pick it up. 8pm on Valentine's evening and still nothing had arrived, even though someone was home during the day and night to receive it. That's when he had to break the news that he did get me something, but that Edible Arrangements had failed to provide the service promised. When we called to request refund today, the girl on the phone appeared to care very little. This store has left a bad taste in my mouth, and now I don't care for an arrangement from this company. I can cut my own fruit at home! Do not trust this location to deliver! Go somewhere else!< /Review>

I've always loved edible arrangements. I have only had one incident where my order was messed up for an important event. I was a little disappointed I couldn't get what I wanted when I ordered well in advance. They were kind enough to reimburse me for what I paid for and I ended up having to settle for a smaller arrangement. Good customer service. They just need to work on getting the order ready at the set pick up time instead of having the customer wait the extra 20 min for them to finish it.<//Text>

in the last week
I paid $109 dollars for a hello kitty set of fruit and a dozen balloons and ordered at 7 am well before this establishment opened up and at 10 i get a call that no hello kitty vase is available do i have anything else i want and then one magically appears and then to top the issue i was called an hour before the estimated delivery time that the balloons that i chose wasnt available and if i wanted to substitute the balloons as welll with anniversary balloons when i was getting these balloons for my mother who has just got back from for hospital So i asked for a manager and the guy puts a female on the phone who pretends to be the manager and says she will be sending me a confirmation email stating my refund was being processed and 30 minutes later still no email. I then reach out to the store again to speak to the female and after about five minutes of the runaround from her she finally admitted
She in fact was not the manager nor supervisor but the same employee that actually called the early morning to tell me there was no hello kitty vase and she apologized and said instead of refunding my order she would ship out the order and chose the hello kitty balloons instead and throw in another dozen balloons as well as some chocolate pops and that the now one hour late delivery will take another hour to reach my mom which is 4 pm and guess what time the store closes?????yes you got it 4 pm and guess what arrived at my mother who just got home...? Yes youve almost got it....just the fruit and vase for 40 sum odd dollars. But not the 49.99 dollar dozen of balloons. Called the store and yup youve got it NO ANSWER NO EMAIL CONFIRMATION OF MY REFUND NO REFUND NO MANAGER NO SUPERVISOR NO NOTHING SO YOU KNOW WHERE ILL BE EARLY IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF WORK...??? YOUVE GOT IT AND YOU KNOW IM GOING TO BE HIGHLY UPSET RIGHT??? YES YOUR ON A ROLL NOW....SO MY ADVICE FOR YOU IS IF YOUR NOT GOING INTO AN ESTABLISHMENT AMD PICKING UP ITEMS PERSONALLY THEN DONT ORDER ONLINE OR BY PHONE EVER....YOUR ORDER MAY COME PARTIAL OR NEVER COME....THANK ME IN ADVANCE....i took the lady advice and put in a complaint at theThe State of California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and dispute the false claims and let that place go down

Called this morning and talked to a supervisor name Nicole supposedly but strangely she spunded like the same employee who was there yesterday, luckily i keep record of everything because the supervisor then pretends to do the same process ass the chick from yesterday but instead a different angle and she kept trying to reroute me to cooperate but i just decide to make the police report and now instead of an otem issue i now have an employee issue on hand that somewhere in this establishment is making cash fraud and stealing money because everyone is in it together by pass calling them when your things dont arrive save yourself the headache go straight to authority and keep on with the process and its not the B.B.B is only for the product its the The State of California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) you want to seek thank me later< /Review>< date>

The RIGHT Kangaroo! There are a lot of Kangaroo movers, vans, and lines around, this one is the one you need. Shortest delivery among competitors, great pricing, and a very well done packing! Smooth move!<//review>

Great experience. I used Kangaroo to move for a work transfer from California to Cleveland Ohio. I had a few concerns with my move as my plans had to be changed last minute. I originally spoke to Chris and he was able to answer all my questions and concerns very quickly. When I called back with all my changes Franchon was very patient with me and helped me figure out what I needed to do to make this move as smooth as possible. The customer service at this company really went a long way in making my move easy.I would recommend this company to anyone needing easy fast service!< /Text>

The guys are extremely rough and hard on your stuff. Most boxes were pressed to half size to reduce the space they occupy in the truck, they don't even care about Fragile markings. HIGHLY Unprofessional and careless with your belongings

Again!  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2bed2a54e4ec7:0x402d00f258da6ebd</gmap_id>< UserId.>

<Review>To reiterate what others have said:
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

They are a poorly run company and a scam.

I was originally contacted by one of their employees to set up my move with a good rate that was "locked in." I sent picture of everything I was having shipped and put it in a list so they could use their "system" to figure out how full the truck was going to be. All good so far.

On the day of the move... they didn't show up. They called and said they would not make it.

On the next day of the move... they didn't show up. They were supposed to arrive between 8-11. Nothing by 10:30 so I called them and they said they were "on their way and would be there between 11-2." At 1:30 I get a call from the driver that they would show up at 4:30.

They show up at 4:30 and the head guy is just PRIMED to talk to me about overage charges. Great. Then comes the packing...

I have moved many times over the years and I have never seen anybody so bad at packing. They did not even know how to properly tape boxes. One guy was proud about the fact that it was his first day on the job. It showed. Just wrapping things in plastic and using BUBBLE WRAP to fit one dish in a box. Oh, and by the way, they dropped pieces, dropped furniture, left cigarette butts in yard, water bottles all around my house, and trash EVERYWHERE.

On top of all of that, the actual cost was 2.5X THE ESTIMATE. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS MORE.

I attempted to contact the company and they answer about 1 out of every 50 times you call. They will promise you the world and underdeliver.

Then comes to the shipping. They "guarantee" between 7-21 days for delivery. I never heard a word from them. I called them on day 10 and I was promised "that I would get a call soon from dispatch telling me that my shipment was being loaded onto a truck." Day 14 passed. Day 20 passed. Day 21 passed. No word from them.

I call on day 21 knowing that my shipment hasn't moved and, miraculously, I get a hold of someone. The same guy I talked to before. He said my check did not clear until 3 weeks after my stuff was picked up because THE DRIVER DIDNT CASH THE CHECK ON TIME.

THEN he tells me that they simply forgot about my shipment.

WHAT?

Excuses upon excuses from the guy on the phone with nowhere close to a shred of customer service.

Eventually I get a phone call saying "great news your shipment has started and will be delivered next week." Yeah, great news.... The driver missed the week window all together and showed up the next week.

I can't say enough how much I despise this company. They are the absolute worst. You will never be able to reach them once they have your stuff. They will overcharge you every step of the way. I don't believe there is a customer service department.

If I could give negative stars I would.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>We were moving from Southern California to the Houston area for retirement. We contacted Kangaroo Van lines along with several other moving companies for bids to move two large homes to one in Texas. Everything was going great including the price, communication etc. The original binding bid came in at just over $15,000. Michael was our agent that planned our move including household, boat and 4 cars. Thus the original bid for the household was at over $15,000, Boat was  $1,200, cars were $600 each. Once everything was loaded for some reason that stated that we had far more then they calculated thus the household move increased to over $42,000, boat to $1,700 and each car to $1,000. Once they got to our new home they would not unload till I gave them an additional $600 due to have a two story home with more than 6 steps and they also wanted to charge me for short haul due to the long driveway. I told them the semi was able to back in here for the people that moved out so you shouldn't have any issues. We sustained numerous breakage to our antique furniture and dishes. We also loss several boxes with expensive items in them. Total loss is around $6,000 plus.  Trying to get in contact with Kangaroo has been next to impossible, left numerous messages but no response. Therefore, I have contacted an attorney and have reached out to California' s Attorney General to investigate this company. By all means do not use this company.< /review>< pictures>

Finally a good experience with a moving company!!! Unlike most people who never or maybe once in a lifetime make a major move, we have moved several times state-to-state with our growing family. Moving is tough, and moving companies typically add to the stress before and create frustrations after. This time with Kangaroo was the first time we actually felt at ease throughout the entire process. Chris the sales rep was so nice, explained everything with great patience, and went over every detail so there would be no surprises. Their customer service throughout was so helpful, Maya was super easy to reach and ALWAYS had a solution to our little issues and last minute changes. The day of the move also went smoothly with a friendly crew and a polite Joshua, the foreman. This was a big move – California to Florida – but all in all, and with one of the lowest quotes we got, we managed to get through it in the best way possible. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Kangaroo Van Lines for all your long distance moves.<//review>

I went to LA to help a friend's grandpa move out of state. Prior to the move, my friend got very helpful and friendly customer service. The day before the move was to happen, they asked us to provide a detailed list of dimensions of furniture and number/sizes of boxes. We took a lot of time to ensure we provided accurate dimensions of everything. Based off our list, they sent us a new quote that was less than the original quote. However, when the actual movers showed up the following day, they said there was no way the amount of furniture/boxes we had would fit into the cubic feet we were quoted, and to move everything would be DOUBLE the cost. We ended up leaving most of the furniture in California because it was going to cost less to buy all new furniture than to move what he owned. We were even at a point that we were pulling boxes back off the truck and having to very quickly re-prioritize what he needed to avoid the additional moving fees. The customer service rep stopped answering our calls and wouldn't return messages. It was a stressful and emotional time, and this company made it so much worse. They were to have everything moved to his new home within 14 days. That time came and went without any communication from the company. After repeated calls to them, we were finally able to get a moving date. It took 37 days for his things to arrive. We think everything arrived. Most of it isn't damaged.< /text>

<review>If you chose Kangaroo, be prepared to work with an unprofessional, unethical, and dishonest company.

We've moved 8 times throughout the country over the past 32 years, major household moves.  This move was for my son to a one bedroom apartment.  One would think, "this is going to be a breeze".  Quite the contrary.   Kangaroo securing our business was a simple process.  The day the furniture was picked up, to the time between pick up and delivery, and delivery was nothing but stressful and unprofessional.   Let me clarify, day of pick up we were moving LESS furniture than planned but Moving Services Skokie Illinois tried to charge us more for the materials to protect the furniture (blankets, tape, etc).   The gentleman I dealt with was rude and unprofessional.  I had to make several calls to rectify this issue and fight my cause.  Everything at the time of quote was specified such as the TV Console having 2 glass doors and Moving Services said they had to charge us for the cardboard required to protect the glass.  Everything that could have gone wrong that day, did.   Then the gentleman had the nerve to ask for a tip $$   What do they teach these employees?
In between pick-up and delivery, communication was non-existent.  I had to call to many times to get delivery information.   Then was given the drivers number to call, only to spend 2 days calling that number with no response then on the 3rd day told that the plans changed and it's a different driver.   Then I had to start the calling process over again. ( During this time I tried reaching out to the sales rep, Chris Brown, and never received a call or text back).
The day of delivery (apartment complex, 1st floor).  The driver of the Budget Rental truck informed me that there would be an extra charge because they had to walk more than 75 feet to the door.   Now they must have thought I was gullible because I suggested they back the truck up to the sidewalk so they didn't have to walk as far.   Guess what, I was no longer trying to be haggled for an additional fee.

Can't express my disappointment enough!!</review><user_id>116245061171718983562</user_id><resp>None<//resp>< name>

<Review>I needed some help moving from LA to Houston so I got recommended this company from my half-sister. I trust my family 100% so wanted to give this a try since it was the first time I was moving from one to city/state to another. I was totally on board, with the methods this company was offering me  along with price &  made me feel comfortable with my possessions. On the day of the move they were so friendly and professional and fun to be around. It didn’t matter what they were moving; everything was treated with so much care that I knew I was set for Houston!  I don’t write many reviews but 4 STARS for this especially when moving because I was so stressed since its basically your life in items that you want preserved and brought with you and thats what this company did.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>In June 2020, I put a $100 deposit against an expected move from Arizona to Colorado. When I tried to contact the agent to settle the details, I was unable to reach him. I left repeated messages, but never heard from him.  Ultimately, I made other arrangements and in September, requested that they refund my deposit. I was assured by their Accounting Dept that the money would be deposited ‘within 7 to 10 business days’.  Three weeks later, I contacted them, and was assured that they were working on it. Now it has been 2 months, and a call today resulted that they couldn’t refund the deposit and that I should contact my credit card for the refund.  DO NOT GEt INVOLVED WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER Any CIRCUMSTANCES!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

If i could i would give 0 stars.They where absolutely great with setting up the whole thing, then it turned into an absolute nightmare. After picking my things up, i gave an address to drop off. After that i gave them ample time to deliver and when it was late, they consistently refused to answer and return my phone calls. After 2 months of waiting they stated they would take off $30 a day for everyday they where late. Then upon delivery they stated i had to pay way more than what was stated when they picked. Refused to give my things until i paid in full without taking the $30 for each day off and that they would issue me a check for those days, yet changed it to every business day. Its been iver a week and still no call and wont answer about the check. After my things where delivered the glass boxes where smashed several items where missing and broken. So very disappointed in this company. They are extremely unprofessional and un organized.< /Text>

I chose kangaroo van lines to handle my move from AZ to FL. I was contacted by Chris and we set an appointment to  do a video walk through. He took great care to make sure we added everything to my inventory list. the best thing about the service was that I paid the same price that I was quoted and they delivered my items within the timeframe we discussed. The movers were great on both ends. All around good job! I would definitely use them again!</review>

<Time>1596808850112<//Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>( Predatory company, Do not use. You will regret it) We had them come to pick up our stuff and move it out of state. They do this over the phone quote. Our quote is $1950.00. The guy who comes out, Tony tells us it looks like about twice the quoted and writes up a new quote. MORE THAN FOUR TIMES the original quote. I believe whole Hartley that this company is predatory in the sense that they know most people will be up against a tight dead line to move and will pay the outrageous money. I would bet they have never done a job for the quoted price.   Anybody reading this remaber when you get a quote that sounds too good to be true, it is.  Do not use this unethical company. I'm a small business owner and want to see other business thrive but this one deserves to go out of business.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>We started our move very rocky. Before we began packing we were looking for a moving company that would do our move and we weren’t pleased with the numbers we were receiving.  And then we received a call from Kangaroo Van Lines and what a treat that was. They gave us a breakdown of everything, costs, extra expenses (if necessary), and time frame. They were so patient with what we were looking for. We thought while on the phone they were going to give us a very harsh price like all the other companies but they gave us a price that beat all the other companies we called. So we booked our job. When it was time to move the movers came and helped us with everything. We packed already most of it but they were happy enough to help us pack the rest. It was honestly a great experience. The best part was we received everything just the way we left it with them. Overall, great experience and a great company.<//Text>< pics>

My fiancée contacted Kangroo about a quote for moving to a different state. Ryan called her while she was at work. She stated I’m at work I can not talk right now please call me later and hung up. Ryan then texted her stating don’t be rude and disrespectful as you asked us too call.

This is horrible customer service and harassment. How is this ok? Customer said they are at work and you text them and harass them?

We recommend not using this service as possible and uhaul are a better option.

<Text>My spouse and I moved back to the US from England with our dog in the middle of a global pandemic, but somehow our experience getting a packed up storage unit from Chicago to Florida with Kangaroo was the worst part of our entire relocation. The sales person was friendly and responsive, but as soon as we paid our deposit (to the day) the communication stopped. We were told in writing that our pickup date was on a Sunday, but that day comes and goes with no call and no one answering their phones or emails, only to be told Sunday evening that our pickup was actually the next day. Consistently told from there that we'd be called on X day to confirm the driver had departed; never once were those dates met and never once did we receive a call that that deadline would be missed. One of the excuses we were given for a specific 4-day delay was that "the holiday" caused the delay- that "holiday" was father's day, and I can't recall any other process on this globe that has a delay because of father's day. The driver called on a Saturday to tell us he'd arrive Monday between 2-4; at 3:50 on Monday he calls to say it will be "some time tomorrow." Dates stopped meaning anything to us when they were communicated by this company. For a while we thought their lower price was worth the horrible service we were receiving, until they started racking up cost after cost with no explanation and no proof, and had us pay under duress unless we wanted them to hold our belongings hostage. We have items missing and items broken, which is always a risk, but we aren't feeling very confident that their claims process will make any of it right.

TL; DR: You couldn't pay me to work with Kangaroo Van Lines again.<//Text><user_name>Mykie Hardy<//user_name><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

If I could give a negative star, then I would. Worst experience of my life. Canceled a cross country move on us same day and never even called to let us know. Truck simply never showed up. When we asked to reschedule they refunded our money and say these things happen all the time. They caused us to have to change all of our plans last minute and spend double our original price with someone else to get the job done. This business needs to be closed. Already submitted a complaint to the better business bureau. Please don't put yourself through working with them, whatever you do! Their sales department is great but you will never be able to talk to them again once they get a deposit out of you. Don't be fooled!!!<//text>

This company by far was one of the easiest and worry free moves my family and I have experienced.We moved from Los Angeles to Miami and it was super easy. We hear about people with belongings being damaged or lost but with Kangaroo, nothing at all. They helped us pack items that we couldn't do ourselves at no extra cost. Not only that they were very friendly and professional. We received our belongings on time with no damage and nothing missing. Overall, amazing experience. Wouldn't recommend any other moving company.<//Review>

<date>1602889145782</date><text>The company is for sure misleading. All of my electronics were damaged, some designer luggage was also damaged and I was missing 2 boxes with all of my sonos speakers that I physically watched the mover pack. Its funny that that box wasnt on the manifest and now its missing. The CEO says "Not my F$%^  problem buddy" and hung up on me. I did purchase insurance through a third party of which will be covered. The day the driver was suppose to deliver my things no called no showed for 5 days and then just popped up. Yes I did file a police report in addition to contacting the local news in both LA where they are located and Atlanta where I live and files a consumer reports claim along with the US Department of Transportation, All Social Media Avenues including Tik Tok, Facebook and it has already been shared 52 times through my friends and family. I strongly suggest you do the same. Chris the CEO is unprofessional, Ryan Hewitt is worse and David from Dispatch too is horrible. The packers packed my IMAC in a box of dishes, then place my knives in a box of pillows. Who does that? I have moved with companies before in the past and this company is by far the worst. My employer used another moving company to move the rest of his employees and informed his partners with other tech companies to do the same. This company is HORRIBLE!!!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A MUST READ IF YOU’RE CONSIDERING KANGAROO VAN LINES:

My customer experience was so disappointing.
Before doing business with Kangeroo Van Lines,  my first mistake was that I believed the few positive reviews.

There’s “Actual Confusion” in force because the positive reviews were like for Kangaroo Movers.  Don’t get them mixed up.  The Kangaroo Movers brand has an outstanding reputation.  Kangaroo Van Lines is not Kangeroo Movers.  Stay away from Kangaroo Van Lines.  A lot of the positive reviews were likely intended for Kangaroo Movers.

My wife and I thought we’d save a few Benjamin’s and found out the hard way that you get what you pay for. One Kangeroo Van Lines employee on the phone was rude to my wife in a way that I never would have tolerated if I were in the room with him.  All my wife wanted to know was why we had to call them to find out we were rescheduled from 7:30 am in the morning to 7:30 pm at night.  She felt that they should have communicated the change proactively.  We were trusting them with our lifetime belongings.

They were radio silent all the sudden when we needed them most.  Who treats customers like that?  In this competitive economy, there was no support, no training, no service, and no patience or common courtesy.  I blame this on poor leadership.  This company won’t survive this new age in customer service.

Kangaroo Van Lines was twelve hours late.  The truck they sent with three possible contracted employees arrived at the storage facility business next door instead of the storage company I use.  I had to go find them and direct them to the right facility.  In retrospect, I should have taken a picture of this foreman and crew when I found them.  A picture speaks a thousand words!

I didn’t realize it at first but the Kangeroo Van Lines driver and worker didn’t seem to understand me.  At first, it was hard to explain to them that they were at the wrong storage business location.  Finally, the foreman got out of the truck to help. He understood me and translated.  They eventually drove over from the other storage company to the right place.  Not sure how they missed the rendezvous point in the first place because I texted to be sure they had the right address.

There were three movers, including the foreman.  When they got there, all I could hear from the foreman were excuses.  One of many excuses was that he had other cargo and not enough space.  I think the late hour, long day and darkness took its toll in these three.

I asked if he could take what Kangaroo Van Lines had agreed to from his list until the truck was full.  I just wanted to get our sofas, beds and essential into our new home first.  We were excited after a long wait due to renovations and a few unexpected plumbing repairs.  I would have settled for anything.  Anyway, this went back and forth.

I finally realized that the Kangeroo Van Lines team sent were just unmotivated and looking into a dark packed storage unit with dismay.  They obviously didn’t want to load anything into the truck. They had an inventory of what we agreed on that should have been loaded early that morning instead of late evening.  They decided not to load it at all.

Then, I directly asked the foreman why he didn’t show up when scheduled?  You see,  I took off work three hours to be there during the arrival time window that Kangaroo Van Lines provided prior to the reschedule they did.  He immediately started with excuses and claimed my wife didn’t confirm when he texted her.  That’s when I realized that dishonesty was at hand.  That’s not her way.  We are a coordinated couple so I know this was a fabrication.

On top of that, we had been told early that morning by a rude employee that the truck broke down in route. Coordinate your excuses guys.

In closing, my opinion is why gamble on hollow promises.  Keep looking for reliability, integrity, and service.  Simply put, you’re  taking your chances here with Kangaroo Van Lines.  Don’t get them mixed up with the stars at Kangaroo Movers.  Kangaroo Van Lines will be a mistake!</Text>< Pictures>

I had to move my mother into a living facility closer to my home and these guys came through for me. I had planned to fly down to my mom’s house to do the box packing ahead of time for her but, when my plans changed and I couldn’t make it down there...Mike was able to accommodate a last minute full pack for us and it saved the day. I only gave him 2 days notice about the packing materials and on pickup day, Joshua and the crew showed up and packed the entire apartment in about 5 hours. Super hard workers on their crew. If I ever move again, I will use you guys again. Thank you!!</Review>

I used Kangaroo to move from LA to Miami and honestly I couldn’t have been happier. The stress of a cross country move was consuming me and from the initial contact over the phone to the final moments when they left my new home they made sure I was at ease. Everything was moved gently and efficiently and nothing was broken. The guys were also very kind and professional and packed everything up in a couple of hours.  I had a fantastic experience, they made my stressful errand an absolute breeze. I really appreciate your help, thank you Kangaroo!</review>

Missing furniture and misrepresentation of cost:

﻿Without success, I repeatedly attempted to contact the customer service department at Kangaroo Van Lines, as well as my initial primary point of contact to seek resolution of the following matters.

During the course of my move, the cost escalated to more than double the amount quoted.

Additionally, I am deeply dissatisfied with the series of miscommunication, which contained false and conflicting statements and incorrect expected arrival times.

Further, one piece of antique furniture was lost in transit. I contacted the driver, but he never returned my call as promised.<//review>

< Review>
Let me start off by saying that I’ve never used a moving company before. I was a bit nervous to do so, I called around talking to different companies to get a feel for what I would be dealing with and I was getting more worried. My last call was to Kangaroo Van Lines and talked to a gentleman by the name of David. It was good to know that this was an American family-owned company. Instantly my fear and worries were gone. He helped me every step of the way and was very straight forward on how moving companies work. On the day of pick up the crew handled all my items with care and were very friendly and professional. I had some specialty items that I needed extra care for (Family heirloom) and needless to say it was treated like an expensive piece of artwork that needed to be on display the next day at the Getty museum. I’m not one to leave reviews even if I like a company, but everyone was so nice and really looked out for me during such a stressful time.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>DO NOT USE Kangaroo Van Lines.  I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH.  PLEASE READ REVIEWS LOTS of BAD Reviews.   This is the WORST company.  I went through the entire claims process and refused their little settlement just so I could post this.  I hope by me posting this people will STOP using  Kangaroo Van Lines.  I am trying to find out about class action suit after I read other reviews. They don't do as they say.  PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM.    I went through their claims process at the end.  WHAT A JOKE.... I had complaints and issues with the charge for SHUTTLE fees and they wouldn't even address it. The managers won't even return phone calls.  The Binding agreement stated one thing and I had been reviewing and working with that for a full month, with all the fees, then when the packers came and packed, I didn't realize I signed another agreement that had the same items, but different fees, SO WATCH out for this.  For example the Shuttle service on the binding agreement for the entire time I was working on the front end, stipulated $250 first 500 cu ft and .50 for every addt'l cu ft, well the contract that they make you sign in a rush when they are picking up re-iterates everything, but the costs are not the same . The cost on shuttle fee, ended up being $700 for the first 500 ft, and .75 for ea addt'l cu ft, so PLEASE WATCH and pay attention prior to signing.  Everyone of their fees on the BINDING AGREEMENT DID NOT MATCH what was on the contract they force you to sign upon pickup.  I reviewed my BINDING CONTRACT the same day on line that morning and the figures were as I had seen for the past month that I was working with the salesmen.  NO MENTION or any warning prices would be different  The people picking up for Kangaroo supposedly are employees of Kangroo and all the forms replicate they are from Kangroo, so why would one think any change of cost would be different.  They snuck that cost in which should be illegal.  Also, delivery was another huge issue, i was advised my belongings would be arriving between 12-14 JUN. Then they don't even call.  Here it is on 14 JUN, I am wondering where the delivery is.  I call and they said, oh, we had to make changes, we will send you an updated delivery schedule.  That never came until I called the 3rd time.  I finally got it and had another window, 23-25 JUN, well the 24th came, still no call as to when the driver would show up on 25 JUN.  They said the weather is holding him up and complications.  Every day, no word, I was having to call daily to try and get an update.  They gave me drivers# and the driver would not give me a date either, he said it depended on complications.  Finally on 1 JUL, I was informed that he would be here on 2 JUL.  Upon delivery, they did not unpack as promised, items such as TV, didn't put bed together all the way, didn't unpack wall clock nor our pictures that were special rapped.  ANOTHER ITEM TO BE CAREFUL, PER CONTRACT, YOU MUST ANNOTATE ALL DAMAGE ON THE DELIVERY PAPER PRIOR TO SIGNING IT.  Well if the truck driver refuses to unpack, how can you write all the damaged items prior to the driver leaving.  The truck driver wants to leave and is rushing you to sign and states you can annotate later.   What a bunch of hog wash.. Also, when I attempted to contact a manager, this company REFUSED to let me speak to a manager.  This is how BAD this company is when the manager will not even get involved.  They said they were a family owned business and care about their customers.  Yeah Right!!!  PLEASE DO NOT USE.  I never normally write bad comments about companies, but this one was so bad that I want people to know prior to getting in the same situation I did.   AGAIN STRONGLY ADVISE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>This has been the worst cross country move experience I’ve ever had. It has been 18 days since they picked up our items and 9 days since our requested delivery date. No one seems to have any idea how or when our items will ship from Kangaroo’s storage facility in our origin city. We’ve been told by different representatives that our things were loaded a week ago, then corrected that no, they’re still in storage but will load the next day, and as of today are still sitting there (45 hours of driving away from our new location). At this point Kangaroo won’t be able to fulfill delivery within their contractually obligated 2-week window. I’ve been disregarded and spoken to rudely when I’ve asked for updates. I’ve received promises from multiple representatives that they’ll call me back with an update same-day, and I have yet to receive a call back. I am exasperated and exhausted by the need to dog this company and their tardiness and seeming disregard for their customers.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This was the best moving experience that I have ever had. They took the time to give me an in home estimate and reassured the safety and transport of my belongings. Their head sales person, Chris, kept me informed with every step of my move. This small business really has the personalized experience that I was looking for.<//Text>

original quote was $1400 . Final bill was $2900. Uses different companies to complete the job.

Showes up not when scheduled  at either times and cant communicate with dispatch and the drivers.

At no point wil you be in control of your move or be able to stop them from racking on massive cost changes. They will either leave you sol on moving day after changing there minds after a deposit is paid for and an agreement maid, or threaten to keep your things upon delivery if you dont pay the movers addiby the foot to move the stuff after there failures to communicate or plan result in thereextra work.

And yes my extra work as well. If this is how they treat disabled Veterans i hate to see how they treat people who they dont like.

Definitely feel like i was extorted and robbed by duress. Nothing like squeezing a small business owner for ever cent he dosnt have during a pandemic.< /Text>

I spoke with 2-3 moving companies in making my decision for my move from Tucson AZ to Burbank CA. I chose Kangaroo Van Lines... They weren't the cheapest quote I received, but I felt more comfortable with the people I spoke with. They weren't rushing me to book with them and took their time in doing a very thorough inventory of my items. They also packed my furniture with moving blankets for free! My items arrived within 5 days and the delivery was great! Very professional and courteous.  Nothing Damaged!  The extra money I paid to use them was worth it and I would highly recommend them. Thank You Kangaroo Van Lines!  I'm comfortably moved in and enjoying my new place!<//text>

By far the worst company I have had to deal with.  Significantly late on the delivery.  Delivered 3 weeks later than promised.  The cost was literally twice the cost of the phone estimate, and waited until the truck was loaded to provide update.  Contract hides loop holes to prevent protection for the customer.  We had to call every day for the full 3 weeks to get updates, they did not follow through on any promise or estimate.</review>

I booked Kangaroo Van Lines for my move from New York to Los Angeles, as they were referred to me by a friend who had previously used them. I'm so glad i did, not only did my furniture arrive in perfect condition in only 8 days (they quoted me 7-14 days), the movers themselves actually placed everything on arrival, exactly where i needed it. The consultant was more than helpful, too, keeping me updated on all the logistics of my move along the way. I will definitely use them again, and highly recommend them to anyone planning a move interstate. Naomi :)</Review>

used this company back in July for my move from Vegas to LA. The movers were very professional and friendly, helped us even pack some items we couldnt pack ourselves only charging for material and not labor. We got our items on time unlike many stories I hear about moving companies so overall I have to say I am very satisfied by them. Highly recommended<//review>

<Review>Please do not go with Kangaroo Van Lines. I ended up paying $2,000 more than I was quoted. In addition to that, they gave me a delivery window of 14 days. No one ever reached out to tell me that they'd be late. Today was the last day in their window. They just told me that my furniture will be leaving the facility in 2 - 5 days. How long is it going to take to get delivered? No idea. I've been camping in my home, waiting for 3 full weeks. They don't seem to care at all. Mike Evans was so keen on saying that he would be with me every step of the way. haven't heard from him since my furniture was picked up. He screens my calls and forwards my emails to Mona Sanchez. Save yourself the hassle. This is a terrible company with zero customer support.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2bed2a54e4ec7:0x402d00f258da6ebd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Text>All of these people are Vilians.  Moving day came and went. They show up and want more money than i was quoted then they had a BLANK contract for me to sign and refused to fill it out. Whose signs a blank contract!?! This is a shady company. Nothing  but con artists.  Unprofessional and inexperienced. Chris is a criminal and he will take all your money. He has nothing but lies and exuses. He hung up on me and will not call back. They kept some of my money and won't give it back. Nothing but Sharks preying on moving people. Terrible. These people are jokes. Don't waste your money or your time. Any other moving company would be better.< /Text>< date>

Used these guys to move from Las Vegas to Medford Or. DO NOT USE THEM FOR ANYTHING.
The first driver showed up was racist from Iran. He was standing in my garage saying things like Iran is the best and viva Iran. Then he had the nerve to tell me that it was going to double in price. When I called the office, they told me that they would take care of things which they didn’t. When I called to ask when my belongings were going to arrive they told me that I had to pay more to get to the 80% they needed before they would deliver everything.
After getting my things, I called about the over cost and that things where missing. All these a holes told me was to fill out the paperwork. Printed off paperwork and call company for information that I need in order to complete this form and here it is November now and they still haven’t returned any of my calls.
AGAIN DO NOT USE THESE GUYS FOR ANYTHING</text>

I used kangaroo van lines to move my items and my vehicles to California. They were about an hour late for the pick up but other than that the service was flawless! I got my belongings in the amount of time they promised and they even reassembled my beds for free. Top tier company and I would highly recommend them. Thanks kangaroo van lines I’m well moved in and it’s bern a pleasure doing business with your company.</text>

I am moving fro California to Chicago.  My arrival date and the date my stuff was supposed to be here was June 3. It is June 10 and my items are not on a truck out of California yet. They keep telling me they have  21 day window but does it make sense that it wouldn't even be on the way? They have had the stuff in storage since beginning of May so the should have had opportunities to get a truck out by now! In addition my original quote of 2600 has already gone to over $4100 at pickup and I fully expect it to go higher.  DON'T USE THESE GUYS!!</text>

Overall great experience, made my moving from Los Angles to Dallas as easy as it gets. The guys are great, assisting us along the entire process. We were happy to see how nicely the treated  our goods. Only small misunderstanding is when the truck was an hour and half late upon devilry date. But as I said before great services, nice people, would recommend!</text>

<text>Hired them to move from Northern California to the Indianapolis area,  asked to be picked up at the beginning of our 3 day window and were told it was a 80-90% chance they would be there when we wanted. The driver called and told me he was scheduled for Saturday,  the last day of the window.  We weren't happy but couldn't do anything about it.  Mind you I booked a month out. Delivery is apparently a different matter,  they picked up on July 27th we put and availability on the paperwork of the 29th. It is August 19th and our stuff is still waiting to be sent to us from their warehouse.  We have called and were told 10 business days,  then 14, then 21 so at this point I have no idea when our stuff will be here. Avoid using them if you want your stuff in a timely manner.< /text>< GmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>This company was very unprofessional. We had a confirmed date for pick up. I had an email confirming day and time, and a second email confirming the day with a change in times. The email clearly said "no further action was needed from me." On the day of the move they said our pick up had not been confirmed via phone so they moved us 5 days later. When I said I had not received any call, they said they had tried calling. The pick up was set for a Saturday. On Monday when I could reach their customer service people, I confirmed that online they did have my cell phone number, but they never called it. I sent a screen shot showing the confirmation email and of my account with the correct phone listed. They admitted a "glitch" in there system where I could see and their account rep could see the phone number but the logistics people could not. Their glitch, but my problem. Even when I explained that escrow closed on Monday and we no longer owned the house, they still did not send a mover until Wednesday. They tried to offer me a pick up earlier....at 1:00AM. What kind of business thinks a middle of the night pick up is acceptable, and by that point it was still 5 days later. The company service rep tried to make things better by offering $500 back. They said all I had to do was sign their form. When I got the form it was a release of all liability. Seriously? Not one single item had even been picked up, loaded or delivered but they wanted me to sign off all liability. Just another one of their very shady practices. Items were finally picked up, delivered 14 days later and in good shape. I doubt I will ever get any compensation from this company. I would not recommend them based on their "glitch" and doing nothing to make it right.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The salesperson, specifically Chris Brown, offered a lot of promises and talk but didn’t follow through on one. At the front end that left me in danger of getting ticketed, and the poor guys doing all the work had to carry a lot of heavy stuff up a steep driveway in Arizona heat. At the back end it took days to get a clear arrival date. They used a semi, which needed 48 hours’ notice to park, even though they clearly promised they would not. My requests for additional information, my email of concern about the whole process, my frequent calls to Chris (“I’ll be by your side every step of the way”) Brown all went unanswered. The movers and office staff work their butts off while the salesperson makes false promises, doesn’t deliver, disappears.  And probably still gets his commission. Watch out for this company.< /Text>

<Review>Twice now I have seen an employee who is not wearing their face mask or wearing it improperly. Your employees are handling food! They should be wearing a face mask at all times and keeping the place as sanitary as possible! Your establishment could be spreading COVID to their customers and not know it. Train your employees and keep them accountable for wearing their masks at all times. I hightailed it out of there both times and gave service to the place next door.<//Review>< pictures>

I usually don't write reviews, but every single time I go there I end up with something I didn't order! Just went there and asked for Italian bread. Got Italian and cheese. I'm lactose intolerant! STOP guessing what I want. Ask me again if you don't get it!
Also, when I ask 2 cookies and a drink, it's supposed to be a meal! They charged me everything separately...</Review>

It's a Subway, so I'm rating this location as compared to other Subway chain locations. It's a convenient location to grab food while waiting for the train and they have always been courteous and quick, knowing that we're all in a hurry and we're all watching the gates to see when the conductors will let us get on our train. It always smells tempting in the morning getting off the train, but I have never stopped there for breakfast. I just appreciate having the smell of fresh bread masking the normal city smells for the first part of my day in the city.</text>

While it definitely is not the best Subway around, it's one of the few places to grab some food while waiting for your train, bus, etc. Service was lacking and I was asked the same question 3-4 times before the lightbulb finally went off in the sandwich artists head. The food itself was average as expected. This location will stay open later on game nights.<//text>

First thing first, I love Popeyes Chicken Sandwich! But this location seems REALLY STINGY on the chicken. I've eaten here 5 or 6 times because it's the closest to my house. The chicken in the chicken sandwich here looks smaller than the chicken patty from McDonald's! I go to the Popeyes on El Camino in Sunnyvale from time to time. The chicken in the chicken sandwich there is twice as big. As much as I like Popeyes, I wouldn't be going back to this store again.< /Review>

The biscuits are the best. They melt in your mouth. The chicken sandwich was delicious as well. Recommend ordering ahead of time since they tend to get busy around lunch time.<//Text>

As good as it has been rumored to be. I always wondered what the hype was about. Got the $10 box and the red bean rice and fries. Chicken was just right and not overcooked.<//text>

service was fast however this one employee with glasses that rung me up was super pushy, rude, loud, and did not have his mask on right, not sure if it was the manager but it was continuous with others he rung up. i politely ordered 2 things and didn’t give him a hard time or anything. he was just straight up disrespectful!!< /review>

Popeyes has the best fried fish and chicken around. The prices are decent actually about average and their biscuits are positively dreamy. Baked with butter already in them, there's nothing like them anywhere!! Super delicious!! Once you've had Popeyes there's no comparison anywhere else!!<//review>

The slowest Popeyes ever. The staff kept saying multiple times "1 minute". After I waited for 30 minutes more and asked them about my order, they ignored me. When I come, the store are not even busy.
Keep away from this store if you don't want to ruin your day.<//text>

<text>Love love love this place, this  place inspired me to try different nashville chickens around the area I even  went to Nashville, TN lol but came back and said Dave's beats them all. Sadly this last I went was a little out of control I'm guessing due to covid 19. I believe they should try a new organization plan. There was an online pick up line of about 20-30 people with door dash and uber eats all in one..  and the line to order there was 3-4 guest with a minimum wait of like 10 min. Not well organized. The table was full of orders that were just sitting and getting cold. . I still give it a 4 stars food is amazing and before covid service was fast and friendly.< /text>< Pictures>

I like popeyes in general especially their spicy chicken sandwich. but this place prepare food too salty. I ordered food from this place multiple times and also ordered food from the other popeyes (1671 N Capitol Ave, San Jose, CA 95132) and compared. all family members believe this place added too much salt. we stop order food from this places and move on to the other popeyes even that is a little far away.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I decided to walk in and try the new chicken sandwich, I felt like the hype has died down a bit and the lines for Popeyes have gone from crazy to tolerable. This spot is like many of the others, okay to great chicken and okay to poor service. The cashiers up front seemed like they had no idea on what to do and overall were completely disorganized. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get 2 sandwiches when there was little to no one in the store. Just be prepared to spend more time than you need to .< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Very bad. Several guests do not wear masks or do not cover their nose. But the service ignore these. Be careful to get COVID-19 and you should avoid this restaurant.<//review>

The crew, especially the woman with blue T-shirt, had very bad attitude to customers and racial discrimination.  For example, I bought $30 chicken, in other stores, they gave me at least two sauces, but in this store, she only gave me one and said the second one will be charged for money with bad attitude.</review>< response>

chicken and the feeling at this location is super good. Came in on a Thurs. I will probably become a regular. Bring your appetite because portions are generous. This place has positive reviews for a reason.< /text>

They put fries into a sandwich bag and sold it as sandwiches to me. It was a togo so I didn’t realize until I got home which is too late to change.</review>

Food and customer service was amazing. Store wasn't clean though. Attempted to wash my hands so that I could eat my food inside the restaurant,  but the restroom was filthy. Maybe it was just a busy day for them. If I give them another try, hopefully it will be better.... and clean.< /text>

<Review>Out of the fried chicken places close to home, Popeyes flavor is the best. Go when they are busy. Busy means fresh, moist - not dried out. Mashed potatoes are the best. Avoid non-busy time...chicken and biscuits could be dried out, tough to chew.</Review>< pics>

<name>Vincent Wang<//name><Review>As far as fast-food goes, this place is my go to when I'm in the mood for some fried chicken. I come here often and the food is better than your average KFC. However, the place is fairly small, not alot of seats and when the lunch rush hits, it's better to just eat in your car. I have some concerns about cleaniness, but I've been to worse and it holds up ok. The area that it's located is sketchy though, so coming here at night is a bit scary. Alot of homeless people wandering around in the plaza. Definately jotbthr most upscale part of town. But I live not too far and never had any real issues. I finally got to try the famed chicken sandwich, and I thought it was good, but not wait in line for an hour good. It was real chicken and it was   above average quality. But they do cook thier tenders right. I gave 3 stars because it's tough for a fast-food chain to blow me away.< /Review><rating>3<//rating><user_id>110336700528800100628</user_id><Gmap_id>0x808fcd07d2363301:0xd50ef3b41d58aaa8< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

This whole chicken sandwich situation can be handled better. One line for chicken sandwiches and the other line for other food just so people can get in and out. Instead of having one register open with one line. Other than that, the wait for the chicken sandwich is worth it lol once u sit down and eat, it takes away all your worries lol.<//text>

<text>Nothing great. Ordered spicy chicken but was very bland. It was either a different dish or they have very different understanding of what spicy means. Tables were not clean either. Order was fast though.<//text>< pics>

<Review>This place is pretty busy, but is limited for sit down and eat! The food is good, and the staff friendly. Your more likely to get your food to go, because waiting around for a table, is my thang? Matter of fact, I'll be there for lunch today!</Review>< Pics>

My first time, good food, good staff, wait time was so so. Better than KFC? No, but not worse. Just different chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy. I'll come back.< /Review>

<Text>The chicken tenders weren't fresh. There was no straws and when I asked one of the cashier's for straws he asked me if I saw them right next to the soda fountain. 😏 Someone went to refill it when I said there was no straws. Unorganized.😏< /Text>< pics>

The food is great. The staff is generally friendly. The food takes a few minutes to cook usually, which is fine because that means it's fresh. They are remodeling currently but it doesnt really affect the seating.< /text>

It's a good pop eyes spot that I've been going to for years now, but down side is when it's busy. The wait time can be very long for a fast food spot.</Review>
