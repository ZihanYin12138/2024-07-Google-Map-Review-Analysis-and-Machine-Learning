Wonderful walks along the campus, when semesters are in session, you hear music, and conversations in all disciplines, and walking in the halls, I am inspired by the student research posters that explain the cool research they are doing. If you ever get a chance to participate in IdeaFest, the celebration or research, scholarship, and creative works, the music, dance, & theatre performances, and poster presentations are amazing!<//Review>

Humboldt State University has a beautiful campus situated in a redwood forest overlooking the Humboldt Bay. It's located in Arcata California which is a vibrant college town with beautiful Victorian Craftsman homes historic buildings and a wide array of unique locally owned businesses lots of fantastic restaurants. Not only does the school offer quality education leading the way some fields HSU historically has had a quality athletic program. The Lumberjacks are well supported by the community making Arcata one of the most challenging places to play in division 2 athletics a few years ago under a scandalous corrupt administration the football program was eliminated which sparked outrage throughout the region Humboldt State football had been a significant tradition every fall for The Lumberjack fans from all over Northwest California. For that reason the school lost a star in my books under the new leadership of the current president and athletic director there is hope throughout the local faithful that lumberjack football could possibly make a return back to the redwood bowl arguably one of the most beautiful football stadiums in the nation for division 2 Athletics. ONLY THE BOLD WEAR GREEN AND GOLD GO LUMBERJACKS!!!< /Text>

Good place! Would recommend doing the tours they have there. Just watch out for the hoboe joes and billy bob Hoe dunks. There’s quite a few that would ask for you to take pictures of them.</review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>This school has no respect for its local community and feels inclined to put all of us at risk by starting school and asking their students to quarantine in Humbolt. As a community our resources for medical assistance is small. This school is jeopardizing the safety of our essential workers and the greater community. The VISION of HSU is
“the campus of choice for individuals who seek above all else to improve the human condition and our environment.”
I see no improvement with these choices and am astounded by the lack of education around the implications their actions have.<//Text>< pictures>

God, I visited this place just for fun while I was in the area a few years back. The campus is so beautiful! One of my long time friends used to go here to get her degree and I was so jealous that she was surrounded but so much forest! I love Santa Clara and the area but it has NOTHING on this.< /text>

Overall a really good school. It’s been a while since I’ve attended, but I’m looking forward to getting a Masters here. I love the campus, and the student body is pretty progressive. There are issues, and racism is definitely one. Also I hear the compost is being dumped in a landfill, which means they should be open about that instead of duping students into thinking they’re being green.< /Text>

Let me start with the positives. HSU has a beautiful campus, the surrounding area is gorgeous and full of of possibilities, and there are plenty of interesting people to meet. Furthermore, my experience with professors has been incredibly positive. The reason I’m giving a one start review is that the administration has dropped the ball. Not only is housing a disaster, but the odds of actually getting the degree you declared are slim because classes are constantly being dropped due to budget cuts. I managed to get my degree, but im one of the lucky ones. I’ve had several friends leave the college because their degree is no longer offered. I’ve had other friends complain about classes that are integral for their degrees getting dropped from the roster entirely. It seems that the graduation rate is 40% for a reason.</Review>

The university has decided to cut classes during its budget crisis instead of addressing its massively overpaid administration. Many students will now have to take additional semesters to finish their degrees. Leaves many to wonder if attending HSU is about profit or student success.< /review>

A rich, supportive school to launch a lifetime of learning. If you want a piece of paper to launch a lucrative corporate gig, look elsewhere. This is a place where artists, scientists, creators and other weirdos get their start.</Review>

<Text>It rains a lot here 😊 however, this is one of the more beautiful Cal State campuses, being set in a redwood forest. Nice, friendly atmosphere and a well stocked bookstore with plenty of lumberjack souvenirs to purchase.<//Text>< pics>

So I've had my eye on HSU since I was a high school freshman. I heard of how great their psychology program is and now that I go here and have actually seen how great it all is, I'm thinking of majoring in psych relationship counseling and minoring in their awesome school psych program(for guidance counselors).
Lots of Hills, Stairs, and need for an Umbrella. HSU (:  Can't beat these vibes!</text>

Your experience on this campus as well as any other campus, restaurants, clubs etc are solely based upon yourself. How you react to certain aspects, people and events in your life. If you go into a place with a negative mindset you've already set yourself for a negative experience and at times without realizing it we tend to reap what we sow. It's a beautiful campus with so many redwood trees and a few pine trees. Faculty and staff are helpful and nice. If you've been aching for a change in your life and HSU has a program for your major this is the way to go. I've been living in Orange County all my life and felt like I was in desperate need of a change. It's not as big as other universities but it is very beautiful. It rains, it's cold and can be windy at times but it's a nice place to be. Some people know this campus as Hills Stairs and umbrellas, since there are plenty of hills, stairs and you'll definitely be in need of an umbrella since it rains quite often the past few days have just been a  tad chilly.
Oh if you are a athlete or a workout fanatic this is where it's at. There are many hiking trials, outdoor activities and beautiful beaches.  I currently live at Creek view and I just a mini pre workout whenever I go up that hill to my place. The Behavioral and Social Sciences Building is on the opposite side of where I live and there are stairs I have to deal with, hills and just walks to class can get you pretty warm. It might be chilly  but once you're done with those stairs or hills you'll be heating up and will take off your sweater, coat or your many layers of clothing.
There aren't really any fast food places, subway is the only one I can think of for now. It's great though, since we'll be bound to eat healthy, which reminds me of the places on campus to buy food and get your munchies satisfied.  The J is a very affordable place to eat, there's also the J Grill, Hilltop Marketplace, College Creek Market place, Giant's Cupboard, Muddy Waters, The Depot and a few more. I'll be reviewing the preceding places as soon as I can. Stay tuned. I will also update my post as soon as my second semester at HSU is over & finals are over with. If  you have any questions, comments or concerns feel free to ask. ^_^< /Text>

Racism is alive and well amongst the staff and faculty members as well as in the university police department.

Much better options for people of color regardless of whether you are studying or visiting.</Text>

<text>HSU is an excellent school.

I graduated from HSU (engineering/ERE) and went directly to a top engineering graduate school and was well prepared. I've been very successful in my career and I owe much of that to HSU.

I had a great experience at HSU, but also recall a lot of hard work to make it through the engineering/ERE program.  But then again, HSU doesn't just hand degress out - when you graduate from HSU the degree you earn will have value.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Before I went to States, I was advised on the kinds of university I wanted to get into. I chose a small and green university, and it all came true when I saw this school for the first time. Very green, the air was really fresh, the teachers and staff were so friendly, and most importantly, I loved my dorm, Creekview which is exactly on the top of a hill.

As an international student, I'm so grateful that I was in HSU,and couldn't wait to visit it again in the near future because HSU and Arcata are like my second home, especially those giant redwood trees are special. HSU is a very decent school.</Review>

Just another typical University that cares less about the quality of your education and just wants to take your money and push you through the system.  They overcharge for everything  and hide unlisted campus fees in tuition
and then have the odacity to call and ask alumni for even more money.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I studied a spring semester 1982 at the HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY English Language Institute
In the beautiful area of ​​RED WOOD, with its long-lived redwood trees of great length and large diameter, and in the east of the city of Arquita, which includes the university, there are beautiful mountains interspersed with rivers of clear water and dangerous as bears abound near the rivers to search for fish they catch.
As for the western parts of Arquita, it is on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and you don't know what the Pacific Ocean is.

درست فصل دراسي ربيع 1982 في معهد تعليم اللغة  الانجليزية التابع لجامعة HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY
في منطقة  RED WOOD الجميلة باشجارها ذات الخشب الأحمر المعمره ذات  الطول الفارع و القطر الكبير و شرق مدينة اركيتا التي تضم الجامعه توجد جبال جميلة يتخلله أنهار صخريه ذات مياة صافيه و فيها خطوره حيث تكثر الدببه بالقرب من الأنهار للبحث عن سمك تصطاده.
أما النواحي الغربية من اركيتا فهي على ساحل المحيط الهادي و ما أدراك ما المحيط الهادي.</Text>

< Review>
My car indicated that my tire pressures was low, so I took it to Midas for a free tire refill. I am so happy I chose Midas because they observed that my vehicle needed new tires and that was the reason my tire pressure signal kept blinking. The entire process to change the tires took about a half an hour and the price was very reasonable. Everyone at Midas was very helpful and friendly and I would recommend using them again.<//Review>

<Review>The Midas Store on Sunbeam Road, Jacksonville (Store 3111) is the only place I would go for automobile service.  Steve, Robert, Michael and the entire crew are all extremely knowledgeable and are always pleasant and respectful to their customers.  I have been going there for years and always leave satisfied.  They explain everything in detail that needs to be done and prices are reasonable.  No better place to go!<//Review>< Pictures>

These guys showed alot of integrity by telling me that it was a simple matter of a loose ground wire. After an hour of troubleshooting invested they handed me a zero balance due invoice. This is an honest and classy shop.

It's a great place to get your car worked on  The guys Are reliable  Theycan get the job done I had my  Car and there a few months ago they remembered me and I need a lube job on my truck and  They did it for free there is an  update about this place and how they scammed me well it's sad that midas has gone to far and Violated every trust Rule Made a and charged me for work they never did  I paid for a timing belt kit  And the catalytic converter which they charge me $800 to weld on and I bought the parts myself from Amazon.  3 months later my car breaks down and I don't know what it is Until   An ASE certified  Mechanic starts to take my car park after A few  Check point of the car were done he noticed a belt sticking out of the timing belt cover Proceeded to take it apart to see a   timing belt That had never been changed new timing belt have  writing on Them  Part numbers dates They were  Made ext This threw up red flags on huge disappointments with  This company< /Text>

One of the best brake service centers I've ever done buisness with. The manager Paul was super helpful and friendly. He and his team did a great job replacing the brake rotors and pads on my 2016 ford fuison. They did not upsell me on any uneeded services and explained exactly what was wrong with my breaks. Great shop experience and I will definitely be returning here for future work on all my vehicles.</Review>

Tune up and brake work, hose replacement and new tires, long overdue, resulted in extensive work that lasted all day, but what a fine job they did!  My vehicle runs like a dream now!  Manager Paul went the extra mile on new tires and his certified mechanic really knows what he's doing.  A top notch mechanic is worth his weight in gold and, luckily, Midas has one!</Text>

These guys are awesome! Had a long weekend of car trouble and they were willing to keep working to find the problem. Once they figured it out and saw it was under warranty from the dealership they even printed out everything for me to take to Ford. It’s so nice to find a shop that isn’t trying to rip you off. They could have easily made up problems based of what I thought was going on but everything checked out and they went above and beyond to be helpful! I would recommend them to anyone and will come back to them for any further car needs in the future.<//Text>

I was sooooo impressed with Chris and Paul!!

I needed a new rotor and they made SURE that I was able to get TWO new rotors on MY budget!! Which was 240.00. The price was 302.00 all I had was the 240.00 from the quote I was given over the phone and they STOOD by that!!!

I cannot say enough about the GREAT customer service!

They also offered to take me where ever I needed to go instead of waiting AND to pick me up and return me to my car!!!

A VERY great experience all around!!!

I have had two vehicles done there and the NEW management is AWESOME!!< /review>

Midas Muffler, 1150 S Santa Fe, Vista CA versus American Auto Clinic, Escondido:
Dishonest, disenchanted, degraded!
Today 7 2 2018, I took in my car to Midas after running over a berm and had thought, done some damage which created a noise/vibration.
2 road tests and searching on underside of car. One tech. could find no damage.
Second Tech. found a nick on the shock. (Overheard the conversation)
Chris (customer service)
Because of the damage I had caused from the berm. Written estimate!
Cost will be @ 517.00 for rear struts and shocks but said, “Best to do front and back @ 848.00 or the car will be off kilter”. Don't you love it??? Honesty, NOT!
American Auto Clinic Escondido:
Owner Matt is the most honest business owner I have ever encountered. His prices cannot be beat and his expertise is beyond reproach. His shop of mechanics will not stop until they find the problem. For 5 years, they maintained my 18 year old, Rav 4. Always fair and excellent work.
Example: Repair for Air Conditioning 600.00 when I had been quoted 1200.00/1800.00 elsewhere
After getting the written estimate at Midas, Vista, I took my car to Matt.  Within 1/2 hour, they found it after 2 road tests and some serious hunting. Voila, a bolt which had been knocked loose on the shock while jumping the berm. Cost for time and labor to tighten the bolt, $0.00 Honest.... you bet! They have my business for life.

Take your car to Matt @ American Auto Clinic, Escondido!!!
Never again Midas, 1150 S Santa Fe, Vista CA</Text>

Apparently, this Midas "total car care" facility doesn't do any welding or exhaust work. Went in to get a small exhaust job done and they don't even have a welder in the shop. I guess I should have called first, but assumed a franchise/shop specializing partly in muffler and exhaust repair could handle the job. I was wrong. Perhaps they should consider a becoming a Jiffy Lube in the near future.

The staff seemed nice, so no issues there. For the management, however, you may want to consider offering the services advertised by the franchise as a whole...Since that's what customers expect when choosing your chain/store.<//Review>

<review>I'm a long time customer of Midas however since moving from out of state this was my visit to this location.  The one star rating was given due to the poor customer service.  I have a lifetime warranty on certain parts which they were attempting to look up.  I offered to assist by calling my old Midas shop but they said they can easily do it and will take care of it.  Both gentlemen who were assisting me attempted to locate my info but could not find it.  As I calmly waited for them to find my info they eventually ended up walking out of the office (about 2 min apart) and begin to talk to other employees in the garage.<//review><resp>None< /resp><rating>1</rating>< userid>

Having used other Midas stores over the years this is by far the best. The manager Paul is the type of guy who will take the time to help you and make things right. As long as I live here this is who will be doing the brakes on our cars. Thanks Paul and staff.</text>

<Text>I love this place. They get me in right away, they drive me home (I only live a few blocks away) if I don't have a ride, they have a wireless hot spot so I can wait with my computer, they have fixed little things without charging me, and I never get the feeling they are telling me something is wrong with my car unless it's a problem serious enough for professional care. I recommend this shop all the time.</Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I've been going to Midas when they hired a new Manager. And now The costumer service is awesome The new manager  Frank Gomez  has the most sincere concerns for every person that comes  in. He will help you understand very important aspects  about the car you are driving. He's very knowledgeable and doesn't try to sell you something  you don't need.. Thank you Frank for your honesty and  for making me  understand the importance  of annual maintenance that will prevent long term problems with my car. And to think the  other place I went to gave me an estimate I could have never paid  with today's economy.  I feel  much safer in my car now, and I didn't have to pay to much out  of pocket, and my stress level is low. I think I'll treat myself to dinner...</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Dont go here! Extremely pathetic service, very shoddy workmanship, not professional at all and astonishingly deceptive advertising. There was a special to do $540 for all 4 brakes to be replaced-they only replaced the front 2 to and LIED by saying the "back 2 were fine". Guess what? No they weren't, had they checked the back brakes it would have been clear to the meanest of intelligence that the back brake drums needed to be replaced. It was evident they didn't even care to look, but we're oh so eager to take my money. When confronted with their lack of thoroughness they standoffishly replied that it was not their responsibility and that it cost an additional $300 to do the back brakes. What a freaking scam!</Text>< UserId.>

If you want to be ripped off then go here. First it took em over 30min with one person in front of me just to acknowledge me. They quoted me one price which i ok'd yet it was tripled when I went to pay. The mechanic spilt transmission fluid all over my engine, dragging it into my car when he test drove it. They did NOT clean it even thought it was dripping off my steering wheel! The mechanic was sloppy and lazy taking 4hrs to change the fluid most of which was spent laughing and joking with his coworkers which means I paid for his slacking!!
This place is a joke!< /Text>

<Text>We have done business with Midas for 50 years. I scheduled an appointment arrived a few minutes early and they weren't even open. In fact the manager arrived more than 30 minutes after they were scheduled to open for the day. Poorly managed, questionable business practices, upselling, untrustworthy.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Perhaps because I do not speak much English, I did not feel a pleasant atmosphere, the person in the box very serious and unfriendly. The price too expensive, compared to toyota and other workshops. In mechanical work I cannot qualify it because the budget was very expensive and I did nothing with them. To check it is $ 29.99, take that as lost money.

Quizás porque no hablo mucho inglés, no sentí un ambiente agradable, la persona en la caja muy serio y antipático. El precio demasiado caro, comparado con toyota y otros talleres. En el trabajo mecánico no puedo calificarlo porque el presupuesto fue muy caro y no hice nada con ellos. Para chequearlo son $ 29.99, tomen eso como dinero perdido.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>An amazing hidden beach along Hwy 1. Very large and spacious with over a half mile of beach shoreline and some great scenery. Two small creeks flow over the cliffsides and create a "green" lamdscape waterfall on the cliff. On the far end of the beach there is a rock shelf where the cliff meets the ocean and provides great coastal views.< /review>< time>

Big parking lot, 5 minutes hike down to the beach, but a little bit steep. Nice view of cliff rock, worth to walk along the beach.< /review>

We initially stopped for the tide pools but spent the whole morning there. Huge beautiful beach with barely anyone there. It felt like you had the whole place to yourself!</Text>

<date>1595200088608<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>This is one of the more remote Santa Cruz, Highway 1 beaches. It has a free parking lot and is rarely that busy.  We love it because it's generally sparse, has a nice sandy beach, nice cliffside views, and our dog can play (on leash). It's a bit rustic and there is a steep hike down to the beach, but it's worth the longer drive and extra hike.  There are old but maintained bathrooms at the parking lot.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Beautiful spot with excellent views. The trail down to the beach is short but steep, and lined with tall grass most of the way. If you can't or don't want to make the hike down, excellent views can be had from up above. There are restrooms and picnic tables as well. Overall, this is a great spot to visit.</text>< Pics>

One of the coolest places to watch the sunset. Definitely plan to make a pit stop here if you're wondering up/down Hwy1. Also, if you go after a big enough storm you might catch water falls coming off the cliffs onto the beach, spectacular.</Text>

Check the tide table, because you can only get on the rock when the tide is low. Use shrimp for bait and most likely you will be successful catching something. I recommend to take a Fishing Guide from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to make sure you don't take any fish with you out of season or with the wrong length. They reinforce the rules. Be safe, the rock can be very slippery and the waters around it are rough. Great fishing experience!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very big and clean beach. There are still walruses to watch today. A seaside rock can be climbed.

< review>
A friend of mine recommended Tattoo Doctors, and suggested that I contact Cecelia as he'd seen examples of her work.  This was going to be my first custom tattoo (well, I have a tiny one on my stomach - so small it doesn't count - and I passed out during that) so I wanted to be sure I could get the best artist I could.  I wanted a floral design based on a watercolor by Charles Rennie Macintosh, and arranged a consultation with Cecelia.  She made a few recommendations as to size, design etc, and I signed up to get it done (at this point, she was booking about 6 weeks out).<//review>

<review>Don’t come here. They messed up my tattoo. Lines on my tattoo don’t meet, he drew outside the lines, and he gave me a wobbly outline. Just do some research before you get a tattoo. This is NOT the place.<//review>< user>

This place is awesome and clean. I enjoyed getting my tattoo. Brian is great he designed a cover up for an old faded tattoo I had on my back and he did a great job. I have a couple of tattoos and this is the best place I have been too . I would recommend them to any of my friends.  If you are looking to get a tattoo go see Brian he is great.<//Review>

I was recommended here so I brought my friend cause she wanted a lip piercing...first off, very humble and radiant individuals working there. They're super attentive to your needs. The way they do piercings, man it's incredible...it's almost pain free and well done. Tattoos are a piece of work too. A most go! They're not called Tattoo Doctors just for show. Definitely check 'em out!!<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Had to leave a review. I got yanked through my piercing because the guy didn’t ask for the service fee? And wanted get done? (“Better Charge the costumers you need to and give them good service”.) If someone cant pay they’ll leave. The guy with  tattoo on his face told me I need to wait because someone who came after me is spending $ 400 on tattoos so they get the service first? I understand it’s a business but seems like they only care about $ not costumer service.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Jimmy The tattoo "Artist"  was completely distracted and off his ADHD meds. He kept talking with other tattoo artists that were standing around just killing time. Also looking away  watching Tv and did this for the entire news hour he kept on trying to make small talk about the news when all I wanted him to do was to focus his very "limited tattoo abilities"
Please see picture below.  GO TO ANOTHER SHOP THERE IS PLENTY OF OTHER SHOPS ON HOLLYWOOD BLVD.</review>

HORRIBLE TATTOO SHOP. Artist was rude and unprofessional. Talked about drugs and how tattooing was a chore. He wrapped my tattoo with a paper towel and tape at the end. I got home and my tattoo was bleeding. He used the same needle to shade my tattoo as he did to outline it. Will never go there again. And I HOPE TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE FROM A BAD EXPERIENCE.! I would strongly recommend no one go to this shop. I wish I could post the pictures.< /text>

This tattoo shop was wonderful. The artist I worked with took his time on my tattoo to make it look just as I requested. Friendly staff and very clean. It's a great place to go for a walk-in and spur of the moment decision.<//Review>

Got a tattoo from what seemed like a newer artist. He took a ridiculously long time just to get the stencil ready, then the tattoo didn't really come out the way it was in the picture I showed him. All in all, it definitely wasn't worth the money I spent.< /text>

<Text>I got my first tattoo there about 2 years ago. I wasn't sure about how it would turn out since it took 5 hours to complete. I also wasn't sure about the colors, if they would stay and just the quality of it all....I loved it and I still do. I had an awesome experience and very reasonable price as well. The female with colored hair did my tattoo and I loved it so much I have been searching for contact info since then and I am so glad I found it because I will be going back when I visit again. Does anyone know the female's name by the way, I would love for her to do other tattoos.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf23618969a7:0x3464dec2f70cd28b< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>The people in the shop are friendly and welcoming, I went in to get a piercing done and it came out really nicely, he showed me all the stuff he was using was brand new(needle, clamp, gloves, jewelry) John told me what he was using, and he told about all the piercings they had done, and after it was all over him and I talked for 30 or 35 about how to clean it and take care of it and what to do if it gets infected and how to change the the jewelry. If I lived much closer I would get more piercings done there.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf23618969a7:0x3464dec2f70cd28b</Gmap_id></record>

Awesome. We were very unsure what kind of tattoo we we would get, how big, what font and.. just everything. This wonderful girl with blue hair was sooo patient with us, trouble customers :) She made our friendship tattoos quickly and it looks amazing. We are so happy! My second friend got inspired to get one too, which was no problem even tho it was late. We three got our tattoos and the tattooer was strict about getting everything clean before each one of us would get our tattoo. Very satisfied.<//text>

<rating>4</rating><text>The lady wrote the wrong word on my chest piece (it still looks super solid) however I wasn't happy about the miswording but she followed up with me and offered to fix it up when it heals in 2 weeks. The chest piece was very detailed and done in one sitting. She's very considerate of her clients as far as pain tolerance, speed, infrequent stops, and many other things. I forgot her name but when I found out I'll let you know, she's dope.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2bf23618969a7:0x3464dec2f70cd28b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been coming here for the past 10 years. Last night got inked with a new artist (didn't get he's name) short skinny hispanic guy. The worst ever. This guy couldnt even get a straight line correctly. Now I'm stuck with a horrible tatto and I have to pay more to get it fixed. Will never go back to this place.< /review>

Took my niece. And was second guessing the sketch but when Carlos was finished it was more than expected. She was a very happy customer. Friendly & clean environment. Suggest everyone to try and stop by. Mahalo!<//Review>

The experience we received here was horrible. I got a white inked cross tattoo that scared and didn't turn out white. It turned out like a dirty grey scar. The lines as well aren't straight. My friend also got the cross tattoo but she got it in black ink. Hers scared even more than mine did. right in the middle where the lines interests she has a crater type scar and the lines as well are uneven and it isn't even black its darker than mine but it is greyish as well. I would not recommend this place or at least the person we got which his name was John V. His license said he has been tattooing for 8 years but he did horrible.</text>

This place is great, I don’t usually write reviews but I had to on this one. They were on point today. Fixed my phone quickly as I had two small children under (4) today. One even offered to let my son sit on his motor bike. CPR wanted more money and needed two or theee days for repair.< /review>

Awesome beer selection! The old resputan porter is delicious if you like dark beers with a strong coffee aftertaste which I happen to love. Cool vibe, pool tables, trendy but casual. Didn't try their food, just went for a quick drink after sightseeing with my girls!< /text>

Don’t waste your time here. Absolute horrible service, horrible attitudes from servers, not a good ambiance. Waited 5 minutes for the bartender to even ask me for a drink. Then poured a totally flat beer, I’m sure the keg had been sitting for weeks.... Why go here with all the other options in Santa Monica? I’ll never be back.</Review>

It was okay, the games were pretty old and didn't work that well. They all take tokens and pool is $3/game (expensive) skee ball $5/game (ridiculous) not sure if I would come back. But it was okay to experience I guess. I flushed the toilet and the handle fell off, the happy hour food is $1 off food . Expensive for no reason, free mini golf though which is cool.</Review>

<review>First of all, how can this place call itself a sports bar when they don't even get the Dodger's games? Second of all I was there for "happy hour" and I still paid $19 for 2 drinks? I had a well vodka soda and a beer! What a rip-off! For those prices you'd think the place would be a lot nicer.< /review>< Time>

<Text>cool bar. conveniently located when I really wanted a cold one. I was in a silly mood while there and marked my face up with a marker. I was just being silly. but underneath really in a lot of pain and inner turmoil. the cool attitude I somewhat received when I first walked in was then further intensified after the self applied face painting and was then denied a second beer request. the bartender did accept $5 for a tip regardless and then asked me to leave. very welcoming to new faces like mine. never again.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

It's a great dive bar. It's a Cleveland bar for sports. But don't hold it against them.  Kidding. It's a great dive bar, if you know what that is.< /text>

I was here 10 minutes ago. I got assaulted by guys served at the bar. I recorded it then asked bartender to call police or what the name of the place was. The bartender was extra neglegent and wouldn't provide me with evidence like" this is Jps bar" which delayed my police call about a minute trying to figure out the name of place allowing g suspects to get away. Thx! Boom!</Text>

As far as dive bars in the area goes it is pretty good. It has 2 pool tables, darts, and a few tv's to watch the games.<//review>

Small hide out at a corner. Two pool tables and screens. A good selection of whisky and drinks. Friendly bartenders, but not a very diverse crowd. Gets a little crowded on Saturday nights.</review>

Classic dive bar to the Santa Monica locals.  2 pool tables but watch out for the sharks!  All in all, good people and super responsive bartenders, true professionals.<//Review>

5pm on a weekday wanted a drink and burger. However, they don't serve food.... I hey should take the grill sign down this is just a bar. The bartender said they server food on the weekends, sometimes.<//review>

Got a whiff of a pretty strong 'food' stench and swore it was either horrible cheese or garlic fries - it was a girl puking next to me.
Talked about Peru and some weirdo jumped in the convo.Cool place though.< /text>

<text>I used to frequent this restaurant back when it was an Irish bar called Dillon's so when I was invited to Paloma to cover their NBA All-Star Weekend party, I was super excited to see what they had done with the space. As soon as I walked in it was immediately clear that at tremendous amount of work was put into transforming what previously felt like a sports bar into an upscale lounge with gold accents on the walls and an inviting bar that welcomes you into the space. I spent a good hour and a half in this area until someone suggested that I go take some pictures at the other bar. Other bar??? That's when I walked past some cute little booths towards the back of the room to discover that there was a whole separate bar in the back with a huge dance floor and a another Dj spinning jams! It was a pleasant surprise and once I thought about it, it made sense because I had always remembered it being a pretty large space under it's former brand. I'm pretty sure it's all new ownership and from what I can tell they've done a great job hiring a fantastic staff! Even though it was pretty busy, they were super attentive and friendly and even were willing to pose for some fun pictures! I've since been back to cover some day parties there while the atmosphere is different (eg the second bar was not being used), the staff were always super welcoming and, did I mention, very easy on the eyes!!! I will definitely be back again soon, with or without my cameras! In terms of the crowd, it really varied depending on the event. The first time I went there for the All-Star party it was mainly Los Angelenos and the 'movers and shakers' & hipster crowd. During the day you'd still get some locals, but there were definitely some added tourists who came in off the boulevard. If you decide to stop by, just remember not be blink because their outdoor signage is super low key. I've included some pictures of it of course! My favorite cocktail on the menu was most definitely 'Rosemary's Baby' and they also have a decent selection of IPA's, which I love! Food wise I would highly recommend any of their tacos! I hope this helps someone out there! It's a great place to chill and hangout whenever you're in Hollywood.<//text><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

My girlfriend & I were looking for a place to grab a drink when we stumbled upon Paloma.

Great vibe, very romantic, has a very cozy feeling with a fire place in the corner. Drinks were great & the service was great. The music was wonderful too. Will be back soon.< /Text>

I left my phone at Paloma one inebriated evening 🙃😵 And for 3 days they held it for me and when people called they would answer and tell my friends that I had lost it there and gave their address a d number if they ever got in touch with me. Then someone from the bar singlehandedly drove it to where I was. She was HOT too lol. Really good people.</text>

<text>You don't get quarters, they sell you tokens. Don't put big bills unless you plan on going back. The stalls are ok, relatively clean. The drying/vacuum area only fits a few cars.<//text>< Pics>

There was little to no foaming action on the brush. There were no towels to purchase on the dispenser. My tokens got stuck, I had to give it a good hard smack in order for the machine to accept it. The only good thing was that they had an air pressure "dryer" and even that was very tedious to use. The tip slipped off and the tube smacked me in the face lol< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Not all the washing stalls work correctly. The switches on the machine are not set to the right settings. Also not all the features work... no degreaser option on 2 stalls. This place definitely needs some attention to detail. If I put money in your machine all of the features should be there for me to use. Will not return to throw money away.<//Text>< pics>

Awesome Customer Service. Really refreshing to see a company take care of their customers and stand by the products they sell. I have no more concerns ordering all of my DIY Mixing products from this website because I know if there is ever an issue they will quickly make it right. Out of 5 stars they get every damn one.</Text>

They have all your needs for mixing with every flavor brand and option available under the sun and the staff, and customer service is second to none, I would recommend that if you are thinking about placing an order with them...DO IT AND DO IT NOW, before the pact act goes into full effect and you won't be able to get your nicotine...Everything else will still be available for purchase including flavors and delutants but get that nicotine now before you cant< /review>

River supply co. Is a wonderful company. Tom and Wes are fantastic dudes! This company has a very wide selection of products and never leave me unsatisfied acquiring the things I need. Shipping is always fast and clean. I have only had one issue with ordering in the year I have been a customer with them. (nicotine was bad and couldn’t use it) They resolved the issue INSTANTLY because their customer service is fantastic. The company is run by employees that only care about their customers well-being. Thank you River Supply! You will always continue to get my business and I appreciate the great work you all do.<//text>

Unbelievable delay in shipping.  ZERO COMMUNICATION.  Says takes 2-3 business days to ship.  Day 7 called and lady said she will expedite it out today, watch for email.  Day  12, called again.  Lady said she will forward to shipping manager, look for email... Still no email on day 14.

If something is out of stock, let me know and I can cancel that part of the order....geeze !<//Review>

Best nic/flavor retailer in the game, period. The staff at River Supply Company is amazingly friendly and helpful, and their products are second to none.

Example: I had my package either fatally misdelivered or stolen by porch pirates earlier today and was given very little help from FedEx, as FedEx is famously in league with Satan himself and eager to do his wicked bidding for eternity.

Upon calling RSC, however, I had the absolute pleasure of speaking to Laura (who I have to assume is their in-house Total Badass) who not only confirmed the missing package with FedEx and created a replacement to go out the next day, but also- on her own time and volition- scrambled to overnight me the glass dropper bottles I was relying on. THAT is how customer service is done, y’all. I’ll be ordering from RSC only from this day forth. I haven’t tried their TFN line, but it looks to be as close to perfect as one can get.

To the president/CEO/King of River Supply Company: please give Laura a high-five, a raise, AND a pony for Christmas. She is awesome and deserves all that and more.<//text>

I have been a customer of Nicotine River for a couple of years, since they showed up on ELR. They not only listen to what customers want, but they make it available fast. Speaking of fast, their shipping is, but they are also fast in answering their phone when you need help, and the resolve is almost immediate. They have become more like family than a company I buy from.  Pretty much.....if they don't have it, I don't need it.  Nicotine River has enough variety that I have no need to shop anywhere else for my DIY needs. Thank you, Grant, Scott, and the entire team.  You are the poster child of what other companies should be, especially in customer service. God bless you. Ozo from ELR.</text>

The best in the business. Great prices, fast shipping, and I have yet to see better customer service. These guys know how to take care of their business. One stop shopping for me, they're always my first choice. To top it off they are fighting for all of us to help save our lives so we can continue to have a healthy alternative to deadly tobacco. Keep up the great work NR!!<//Text>

<text>I highly recommend this place. Everybody that I spoke with at NR has been very nice to help me out and easy-going to talk to.

5/5*
The flavorings that arrived were very secure within a thick plastic enclosure, with clear packing tape to keep it in tact.

5/5*
The bottles that arrived were in a plastic bag as well, with a plastic zip tie to keep the bottles secure and from shattering.

5/5*
Every box that I've had delivered from them is also filled with several biodegradable foam packing peanuts to insure the safety of the contents inside upon transport.

*5/5
Everything that they do is properly done, and they take the time to cleanly put everything together.

***************************************************************************
Testimony.
***************************************************************************

This place is the best. I recently put in an order for the memorial day special. The very next day, I thought of something that I wanted to add, at the very last minute; so I e-mailed NR, and Adair replied back right away. She said that she would be happy to add it on to my order and that she would set it up for me so that I would have it together with my initial order, with the free shipping.

Within the next few days, I received a smaller box, (the order that I added on). I decided to call NR, and I found myself speaking to Zach(Zack) on Friday or Saturday about not receiving my initial order. It said on the tracking that I received my order on the doorstep or garage, yet it was not anywhere to be found. He asked if I could call my local USPS office, and figure out what was going on. They told me that they did not have any whereabouts of the initial order that came in a larger box. He would look into things and call me back.

I then gave NR a call on Sunday and left a message about the situation.

Adair gave me a call back on Monday, right away, early in the morning. She said that she would try and figure out what was going on, and that she would call me back.

I missed that call, but shortly after I called, then spoke with Grant.

He said that he would replace the order for me, and that this time I would sign for the order. Immediately, it arrived the very next day.< /text><username>Max Fadden< /username></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Convenient website, alright prices, easy to navigate & order
BUT
- product quality sub-par (x2 $80+/- orders a few months apart)
-long order processing times (they're website confirms this in the 'knowledge center") Fedex got it across the nation faster than NR got it into a box & items that were in said box were completely different than those in the confirmation email) packing slip in box actually listed the wrong product(s)

UPDATE: I ended up ordering with Liquid Nicotine Wholesalers... and my e-juice has never tasted better... I had gotten used to all the ingredients from NR being harsh (i thought it was just the name of the game, no matter how I mixed)....  Nicotine was harsh, VG was even harsh... Words honestly don't even begin to describe my feelings towards NR after all the money spent and juice wasted. If your ordering from NR, try ordering from Bull City or LNW and compare/contrast. The difference is shocking. I now know there's a reason why you don't see Nicotine River mentioned too often on E-juice Recipes.<//Text>< Name>

We recently had a sale which slowed order processing slightly, but all in all we have greatly improved our processing speeds. Also, regarding the quality of the products we are always happy to replace a bad batch if you encounter one, as long as we are notified within a timely manner. With the intense heat that is still occurring after summer, it's not unusual for nicotine to encounter oxidation in transit which we unfortunately cannot control.

Absolutely without a doubt the friendliest most customer service oriented DIY supply site on the web.  Everybody there exists for one reason, to make their customers feel like they are the most important thing on the face of the earth.  They are always willing to go the extra mile.  Best VG I've ever used, the nicotine is pure and clean with no harsh flavors.  The flavor selection just seems to keep growing and growing.  All in all a great place to do business.  I neglected to mention that their prices are pretty fantastic too!</text>

Great experience buying from nicotine river. The staff is always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Not to mention the large selection of products they cary are second to none. I would highly recommend nicotine river for anyone in the vape community!!< /Text>

I ordered  nicotine and i selected pg on the website and i got vg. I reached  out to customer service they did respond quickly but my invoice said vg. I asked  if it was an error on the site i know what i selected and i always order pg nicotine.  Vg doesnt mix well with menthol. I was told that there is nothing they can do.... well safe to say i will never order from this website again. I even offered to send the vg nice back other then quick response this company has terrible customer service< /text>

<user>113059154124885134102</user><Text>Ordered from Nic River twice. The first time, it took almost 2 weeks to get my order. Online orders typically show up within 2-3 days as I'm not in a rural area.  Second time I ordered, I ordered a gallon of PG and they sent me a gallon of nasty PEG! So needless to say, last time I'll ever be dealing with this incompetent company.

(edit 1/12/19) Nic river sent me an email apologizing for what happened, and promptly sent me the correct gallon of PG. Review edited from 1 star to 3 stars.< /Text>< pics>

These guys are great. Good products and very responsive. Especially when a person accidentally chooses $140 worth of shipping on a $70 order!  They corrected my mistakes with no hassles.</Review>

Best place to purchase all things needed for the DIYers of E-Juice. Fast shipping, great selection of flavors, nicotine, PG, VG and lab ware. Prices are hard to beat. Super friendly staff who always provide the best customer service. My only place to get my E-Juice Vaping Supplies.</review>

<Text>So was debating writing this. However I think it’s a fair review. I place a order on June 12. On June 12 I get a email saying it has shipped. On June 15 I see nothing has updated with USPS. I contact customer service and the responded quickly and said if it wasn’t updated by Friday they would send me out a new one. Ok well Friday comes along and I get a email saying the will ship it out today. On Monday I get a email saying it finally shipped. A week after I ordered it. I call them at this point and they swear that they shipped both packages. Here’s my problem. I got the 2nd package on Wednesday. Only took 2. Days to get to me. Never did receive first one. Still no tracking info updated. I feel lied to. I think they are in the middle of a move and didn’t ship out my package and it took me calling them to get it shipped. But all they do is blame USPS. I will think long and hard before I order again from them.</Text><user_name>AZ Pilot Gaming< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Its not hard to see why these guys have an average 5 star rating. Good business make sense and this company understands that. The more I look into their history the more examples I find of solid ethics and smart leadership. A growing customer base speaks for itself. NICRIV is my "go to" from now on. Not becuase of what they do well on an average day, but because of what they do on a bad day.<//Text>

Not very happy that I chose them over direct from FlavorWest or even LNW because the order wasnt even shipped out when I called 4 days later. They claimed that they had just switched to a new shipping process but no one told me that or offered to upgrade my shipping to a faster priority at their expense when I called about it. Now I am being told 4 -5 days for Fed-ex ground for an order that hasnt even shipped yet. This did not save me money....or frustration and was not a good way of dealing with a new client. I know my 100$ order doenst amount to much but I had planned on weekly orders once I tried the products. Im sure the products are top notch as long as they are 100% original but the customer service and communication left me wishing I hadn't chose them. I will update this once/if I receive the products I paid for.<//Text>

Still havnt recieved my order & customer service didnt even reply to my last reply to them..my first few orders last year seemed to be ok with timely processing & the shipping i understand is out of nicrivers hands..however i order alot online & usps is alot faster than fed ex..i usually always get my orders from all other suppliers within 7 days max..& the last 2 times its been 7 days b4 nicriver has even processed my order & another week to recieve it..when this was discussed last month i was given a guarantee that if i beared with them This would never happen again..so a month later here we are again..my texts are being ignored & my shipment looks to finally be on the way after a week..only thing good about nicriver is there prices & selection but with such awful experiences ive had lately i would think twice b4 ordering from here..as Jai Haze says.."ive kept it real..HAVE YOU"..?<//Text>

BEYOND impressed. A company that puts customer service first and foremost, actually *cares* about the person and their experience, all while providing first-class quality products at a very market competitive price!!

Personal service by real human beings means alot, and they're quick to respond to any issues that arise, or questions that you may have. They're also firm supporters of the Vaping community, with active involvement in the e-liquid-recipes forum. It's personal to them, and it shows!!

For an *online experience* to feel like you've just walked into the doors of your favorite local business (restaurant, bar, barbershop, etc)...that's HUGE in my book!</text>

I'd like to start off by saying, I will not order from anyone else. Nicotine River, goes the extra mile. I originally had been ordering from another company and had a nice routine going. But then I heard about this up and coming company that had happened to be local to me. Some of my buddies had been ordering from them already and kept urging me to order. So finally I placed a small order. And sure enough it came on time and quality was top notch. I am happy to say that their customer service is as great as their product. Which is hard to find in the Vape industry. All in all, give them a shot, I know you'll place a reorder.

DIY E-Juice Kit
I was blown away by this kit.  I received more than I thought was included (yay), and all the ingredients are superb!  I've been happily mixing recipes ever since my shipment arrived.  The flavors are really, really good.  Nothing is harsh, or sub-par.  My only complaint is the box came damaged, so one of the plastic tubs isn't usable.  I blame UPS for this, NOT Nicotine River!  If you're considering jumping into mixing your own juice, you should definitely jump in with both feet with this Kit from Nicotine River!<//Review>

There are several things that set apart where you order your supplies from. Products that you need for diy are readily accessable and price point on these products are competitive if not lower. I am new to diy and looked for a long time for a vendor that has everything that I need at one place so not to pay shipping with many vendors to obtain supplies. Let me say Nicotine River's price is a very good value also. These two points of business, they have been spot on.
However let's look at what sets them apart from others out there.
The customer service that I received from them was not only very helpful but any issues were directly my fault when ordering. I am new to diy as I stated and on a level second to none a personal aspect of customer service was given to me that felt more like I have spoken with them for years.
This will be my second order with them and have had no issues with either. Even if you have issues , I have no doubt that you would be taken care of. Thanks Gr nt</text>

<review>Nic nic nic...the best I've ever used and I've used many....these guys are amazing. Their nic is superb and i say this knowing how picky i am. In terms of flavoring they offer ridiculously cheap prices....if you love flavourart products i will guarantee you that there is no better vendor than these guys....they have FA cheaper than FA direct themselves when i compared the two.  Best part about it is that they don't take weeks to ship since it's in the USA and not Italy. Their nic is dirt cheap compared to other premium nic base vendors but that doesn't mean that it is cheap quality.  They clearly understand supply and demand being that they sell cheaper than anyone else by a great deal.  I'm loyal to them with their nicotine and FA flavors.  They will go above and beyond to make you happy and they will usually ship same day.  At times i wish i lived in CA just to be able to go and shop right there because they seem to have a nice lounge area. I've spoken to the owner (or one of them i think ) on the phone and he is a very humble and grounded person who offers great customer service.  They have it all guys and they are the real deal.....NR is the truth....<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80e82e9226b5dd71:0x5ec10e7276fd226</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Hands down the Best DIY E-liquid products, and that's not the best thing about the company. All companies should take a page from Nicotine Rivers customer service. Thank you for all you do peeps!!

I must admit im angry with myself for not finding this place sooner, the service and quality of products are second to none, the shipping is reasonable and very fast, I really appreciate that you stock such a large amount of flavours from the most famous vendors, thanks again

<Review>Went to have a hideaway sub installed on my Fit and they short cut it and just ran the remote power straight into my fuse box and had my drl back on which I didn’t want. I asked if they could reroute it to not have my drl the way it was off before the install and they wanted $150 to get it the way I wanted. Ignored my calls when I wanted to fix the matter. I guess my business isn’t valuable enough after the first unsatisfied service....<//Review><time>1597602541034<//time>< rating>

In all honesty Auto Sound & Security get's ZERO stars. Since it doesn't give me that option, I had to give them 1 Star.

Tony (Owner) is a decent guy, and will actually give you a decent deal if you haggle. But please keep in mind that his installers are rookies, and will use your vehicle to see what works, and what doesn't. Sorry, but for a professional car audio shop, I don't think anyone in their right mind would ever invest in "ruining" their own vehicle's audio system. That's almost like paying someone to punch you in the face!!!

When I got both of my cars back, I had to take them to another shop fix the mess. So basically Auto Sound wasted my time and money. They also ruined my OEM stock mount that sits behind my dash.

Avoid this place like the plague!<//Text>

My truck is so loud that it leaves my ears ringing. I’ve seen Metallica live a few times live and the sound system these guys put in is the closest thing to it. I’ve had the speakers for a few years now and they still sound so crisp and if I have any problems with my sub or eq they fix it quick and easy every time. These guys are legit and I won’t go anywhere else.<//Review>

If you want great service this is the place to go! I bought my Car Play  from them 3 years ago and because of an update on my phone it stopped working. I didn’t realize this so I stopped in and Kevin was so nice. He stopped what he was doing and took a look. It wasn’t long before he realized the problem.  They are a family owned business and you can tell. Thanks for not making me feel dumb, since all I had to do was restart my phone 🙄< /Review>

<review>Great business. Very helpful staff. Special thanks to Kevin for taking the time to help fix my problem. Unlike other businesses who just want your money here they take care of you so you can share in their care & love of a great car audio experience. Thanks again Kevin the system sounds great & it's because unlike other business you offered me your time just before closing to make sure I enjoyed my car audio experience. I recommend this place to everyone who is in need of car audio & security!< /review>< user_id>

<response>None</response><text>I've known Tony for years and trusted him and his ideas. I went to the shop one day. And told him my ideas and what I wanted to do. I wanted medium to top of the line jl audio door speakers with tweeters and he  gave me low end basic entry level speakers but over charged me for them later to find out.  I recently went to a different shop to have them check over my whole system and wiring since I told them I smell like some wires are melting. They come back to tell me that tony has put in cheap and underguage  wiring to my amps which would cause the smell of melting wires. He put subs in my truck behind my rear seat and over the course of a year the subs are wearing down and are soon gonna have a hole in them since he did not put a cover over them to protect them... now since tony doesn't do refunds on his work I gotta pay the consequences and have to pay more money to have another shop fix his problems.<//text><GmapID>0x808e33b12f5b9d73:0xaa7c6457839db6d5< /GmapID>< rating>

Tony listened to the current audio, understands customer's expectation and gives practical upgrade suggestion accordingly, instead of trying to sell expensive stuff.  He encourages me to go back home and do more research by myself before making a decision on the upgrade plan. He did the work neatly and quickly. Eventually I got an obvious improvement with a low cost.</review>< gmap_id>

<review>honest. runs the business with integrity. listened to what was important to me for my car audio system and gave me his fair opinion and recommendation.  and the price was even BETTER than the budget I had set for myself!! thank you so much!  the install was awesome and neat. my FR-S was just as clean when I picked it up as when i dropped it off. and the gentleman who sat in my car for over 30 min educating me on my new stereo had SO much knowledge (and patience😁) thank you all! I am so very pleased!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>This is the place to go!  They hooked me up like no other!  My stereo and camera system are top of the line and sound amazing!  And they did it that day!  I was able to finance what I needed to and they boosted what we planned on using to top grade at no extra cost!  This place really know what they are doing.  I have a hardtop convertible and they were able to perfectly place the sub I wanted but better inside my trunk space!  I can’t say enough about them!

Great quotes and service. I learn so much more talking to the amazing people in the shop than looking online. After my sub was installed I realized my hazard light wasnt working so I came back and they fixed it in 30 sec (they live up to their work and i was told i get 1year warranty on labor 🔥). I got multiple quotes for a lot of upgrades i want to do in the future and Kevin walked me through so many options which help a lot cuz im quite picky. I was here in the first place was because I got the cheapest quote from them compare to other auto audio businesses within 20 miles of San Jose. Seems like these reviews were actually written by customers and not bots lol<//text>

I’m an older guy that recently purchased 2019 Toyota 4rnr Trd pro. Audio components (entune)
Sucked. I went into Auto Sound on Blossom Hill looking for advice (pioneer or alpine) really wasn’t too concerned about price.

The store manager/owner really took care of me. I stress never set foot in here before. I went with a high end pioneer unit that was about half the cost of the alpine unit. This guy was great. Super curtious, detailed oriented. Don’t let the look of the shop fool you. Way... happy with price and results.<//text>

<text>Highly Recommend!  They worked on my Ford  installing Pioneer AVIC 8200 unit.  There was a problem with compatibility,  and in addition to that it is very advanced system requiring high technical  skills to install. I know it because I hired two other companies before and they failed to install in properly, making it only partially functional and I still had to pay for their services! Only Auto Sound did my Pioneer system fully functional for very reasonable price.  I wish I found them earlier.  I would save a lot of time and money.

I have always had The Best experience with Tony . I get different cars all of the time.  They have more knowledge and experience with the products than you can ask for.

Pricing and availability for installation blow's box stores out of the map coming to see you guys soon with another srt8. Thanks for the great job.</text>

<Review>Tony and his crew did a fantastic install of a new deck and rear entertainment system on my SUV. His prices were fair and the work was well done. My kid loves the rear entertainment system and we can now enjoy many long family trips in our SUV. :)<//Review>< Date>

<Text>These people were awesome. They had the cheapest prices. they didnt bullsh*t me. they explained exactly what they were going to do, and how much it would cost, and even made it a point to get the work done within an hour after I dropped it off. They called me to update me periodically, and were extremely nice about it all. They have earned my business from now on, and happy I found them!</Text><rate>5< /rate></record>

He helped me troubleshoot a problem with my Pioneer AVIC at no charge..

And his prices are very reasonable, I purchased 2 pairs of speakers and some enclosures
and he installed them in the back of my truck at no charge...

Walked into store and there's a person who i guess does the sales bu not sure. He's busy speaking spanish and stuffing his face wi food and doesn't even acknowledge I'm there. Waited 4 or five minutes and he's still on phone. Turn up one radio and gets up and walks outside. Turn it back down he walks back in and sits down and continues his rapid jabbering on phone still not even making eye contact. Dont need my business!</text>

<Response>None</Response><Review>This is the best place to have your stereo installed. I had all of my BMW installed with custom stereo system. All other shops wouldn't  install a car that has the idrive. My current BMW 750LI He was able to install and beat everyone price on all my JL Audio amp, 12" W7 subwoofer, 3 way componet speakers installed making the car sound great!! They made a custom faceplate for my double din deck. Instead of installing headrest for viewing movies Tony the owner installed 2 Dell XPS 18 inch full windows 10 tablets with unlimited storage of 2TB in each tablets for movies, and music. . To interlink between the Pioneer NEX8000 deck. The customer service 5 stars, pricing was great!!!  There installers are the best in the bay area! They have exceeded my expectations eveytime!!<//Review>< rate>

Good service! I got the black tonkotsu ramen. i also got a shrimp tempura roll. I loved the ramen, the sushi rolls was okay, not the best! The tables are separated by room divider wall things. They’re taking extra covid precautions!<//Review>

One of the best ramen I have had in a while. Servers were nice and they were following covid regulations unlike most other restaurants I've been to recently. Continuous online delivery orders showing how popular they are. Highly recommend!< /Text>

<review>Actually I have been searching for a great Ramen place in orange county for a long time and sadly, this place disappointed majorly. First the prices are too expensive for what they offer, and for the amount that they offer. The Ramen was average and I mean average. Not a lot of flavor and the meat was dry. I have had better shrimp tempura rolls at Sam’s Club that tells you all you have to know. I won’t be returning. You need to lower your prices also.<//review><user_id>111079392605575746539</user_id><Name>Jon Matson<//Name>< time>

Yoshiharu restaurant was good. I ordered spicy famous famous. The food was real spicy and like it. Also, I added extra noddle for sure! The taste was good and I liked it but because of price I gave them 4 stars. The price for Ramen was a little bit higher than another places. I had Ramen in many places and for this reason, I think it could be lower. Totally I like it and recommend to anyone who like Japanese food.<//Review>

This is a great ramen place, probably the best in the area. Has a nice atmosphere. A little pricey but it's definitely worth it, you get big portions.</Review>

Boyfriend tried Tonkotsu Black ramen bowl and really enjoyed it.  Karaage Chicken has the perfect crunchiness and flavor.  Cozy restaurant with limited seating, so remember to put your name down to get a table.  Table turnover is pretty quick.  Not a long wait for dinner.  Wasn't there to observe lunch.

The genuine efforts by everyone was not missed during my first visit to Yoshharu Ramen in Orange, 5 Stars y'all 👍 I enjoyed their Tonkotsu Black today. And I'll be back for their Tonkotsu Miso next week, if not sooner. 'Casual too Cool' is the dress code. Certainly an inviting spot to hangout with a few friends, a first date, or a date night for you married folks.<//Text>

The food was decent, BUT, they have a giant sign outside that advertises $2 drafts. Is what brought me in. However once you sit down ask for it they tell you, “Only with a Yelp check in.” Nowhere is that mentioned. My problem isn’t the checking in part, but the fact that it’s not mentioned on the sign. It’s misleading advertising, and I didn’t appreciate it very much. Not to mention that after this confusion the waitress basically ignored me for the rest of the meal.All they had to do was add a sticker  explaining the conditions, but they would rather pull one over on new customers.< /Review>

I've finally found the best udon spot in the city! This place is such a gem hidden in Japantown's mall. My favorites are the mentaiko and sukiyaki udons. The portions are perfect and leaves you at a comfortable full spot.

It's a great spot to go with friends too because they let you join the waitlist so you don't have to waste time waiting there.< /Review>

< Review>
Came on a Sunday afternoon at around 1PM. A table or two was still open, counter was practically empty. Ordered the Tonkatsu Black with small combo side of Karage and extra noodles. Karage came out first then main dish and extra noodle on a small plate. Food overall was good. Karage may be slightly hot by the time the noodles arrive, so I recommend eating a couple while they are fresh. Total came out to be a little over $18. My overall experience was good.<//Review>

I’m not one to write negative reviews unless warranted, but this spot is just terrible. I ordered a baked salmon roll and a popcorn shrimp roll and it was literally a thin layer of salmon and some crunchy bits on the top. Their only redeeming factor is the deal with their beers. Horrid< /review>

Good broth, good noodles.  Ingredients are good but can easily be improved. Soft boil egg were hard boiled, corn was canned, meat was burnt and dry so the flavor hid the freshness.< /review>

I had the Tonkotsu Miso and Ika Karaage.

The miso base wasn't very good and the noodles used felt like instant noodles.. they added greens which made the soup more bitter than it should be making it difficult to enjoy it. The pork was cooked well and was charred on the skin side for a little smoked taste which I didn't mind. The egg was just right and the green onion slices were perfect.

For the Ika Karaage, it was cooked well but seemed too few for the price. It wasn't anything special to merit the more than $5 price tag.

Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience but I was hoping it would be worthwhile to visit considering I live nearby. I've had ramen in Japan and the station ramen shops are way better.</text>

<text>I love this place and my family seem to go here once a week. I have the Spicy Miso, my wife the tonkatsu or Miso, but we’ve tried them all and they are crazy delicious. For those who do not like spicy, don’t get the spicy miso. It’s not ‘white people spicy’. It’s the real deal and amazing!<//text>< pictures>

I definitely know a thing or two about ramen (just look at my profile picture--I was born in the land of noodles) and this the **best** ramen I have ever had.

Pictured is the Tonkotsu Black, with extra egg and corn on the left and extra spicy on the right. The broth is out if this world; it is this thick, savory, indescribably amazing base that has me wanting to drink every drop even if it coats my arteries for the rest of my life (worth it)!

Our entire meal with two bowls, three extras, two soft drinks, and a beef musubi was only about 32 dollars. The prices are very competitive.

Be warned, even at 4pm on a Sunday it was 80 percent full. If you come during dinner time, expect 30 minute wait or more. Trust me, worth it!<//Review>

Some of the absolute best Ramen around.   If you love spicy, get the tonkatsu black bowl with level 3 spicy!  Their gyoza and garlic edamamae are a great choice too!  Only disappointment is that they stopped making fried rice! It was one of their best dishes!< /Review>

Other than that the food was excellent and so was the service. One of the best Romens I have had. Unfortunately I had to leave half way through because it was just too loud.< /text>< Response>

<Date>1546528208377</Date><rate>4< /rate><Review>The ramen is very flavourful! Here is my breakdown:
1. Wait time: not bad at all despite the size of the place and only 2 servers!
2. Service: Awesome! There were only 2 servers and they managed it wonderfully!
3. Ramen: As mentioned, the soup is flavourful and the noodles were not too firm and not too soft.
I normally like my soup and noodles to be super hot (in temperature), so for me, I felt it wasn't hot enough. The egg was not cut like in half like you normally see, but that was a good thing as it did not mess up the yolk; however, it didn't get hot enough in the center for me.
This place also has the option for no fat in the pork slices, which is excellent! Most ramen places don't have that option.
Overall, I enjoyed their food and it hit the spot for me!<//Review>< UserId.>

The best Ramen around and great service. We had the best server "Alvin", he always remembers his customers and makes you feel right at home. As I abservered all the servers during all my visits, they look very pleasant,  knowledgeable with the menus and alert to your needs. Small location but great service.<//Review>

<text>"Clean" is how I'd describe this ramen place.  The interior of the restaurant is very clean,  and the taste of the ramen is very clean as well!  Service ain't bad either.

I had the spicy miso ramen (Level 1).  What I liked about it is that you could control how spicy you wanted it--there was a small ball of the spicy stuff in the broth, which you could take out as soon as you had the level of heat you wanted.

Price is on par with other places.  My only complaint is that the karaage appetizer came out so quickly--which is normally not bad, but it was warm, and felt like it was under a heat lamp (I could be wrong, but it just felt like that!)  But that's a minor thing as the ramen was the star of the show.</text><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

Not recommended for groups. Five adults and one infant arrived around 11:45AM on a Monday. Per tradition most of the seating is communal, with a few separate tables and some barstool seats. But because of how poorly and sparsely people had been seated there wasn't room for a group larger than 2 or 3. We were bruskly told to put our names on a waiting list in a tablet (which wasn't signed in, so wouldn't have worked). And then told to go outside as they didn't want us in their entrance.  As it was windy and we had a child with us we left instead. I can't speak to their food, but their customer service was very poor.<//review>

I haven’t been there to eat, but once I went there, it was 30 minutes to closing time and many people were inside enjoying their food, we personally were going to get takeout because it was late but we ended up leaving cause they said they did last call at 9:30. If you want to get a late night snack here then make sure you arrive 40 minutes before their “stayed” closing time. They should state that their closing time is 9:30 if they are just going to do last call 30 minutes before closing time. Haven’t tried the food but it looks good.<//Text>

What a fulfilling meal in a happy little shop. The flavors and smells, welcoming staff; there is so much to like about this place. Portions are a bit small but that allowed me to try other tasty items. Definitely walked out smiling. Next time I'm going spicier!</review>

Good spot for ramen. Stick with the hot ramen though. The one cold ramen is a lil odd. The appetizers a nice and a good variety. The staff are all super friendly. Now that fall season is here, use their website to put name on wait list.  They are getting more busy now.</Review>

<Review>The best Ramen in town!

I found on Uber eats and have been to the location as well.

I recommend the Tonkatsu Spicy Ramen level 2 (or level 1 if you don’t like spice). Extra pork and extra egg.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Place is getting sloppy on quality, meats are just meh, grills and pans aren't cleaned well so expect charred items with your food. We loved this place before as it was close by and a bit better than the ramen house by Target up the street. I'd rather drive a few more miles even in traffic before resorting to here again. I believe they still have the $2 beers which most places do.< /Text>

Very good legit Japanese noodle house. I'm from San Diego and and I love eating at Raki Raki and this place has same quality with a smaller but very good menu. I definitely recommend this place for a great tasting quality noodle house.<//text>

< review>
This is my new go-to ramen spot! If you're from the area, then you know shin-sen-gumi gets wildly crowded and what's up men is personally too cramped and loud for my taste. But Yoshiharu really delivers with their simple ramen and rice dishes and their clean cute interior! The waiters are really attentive and you don't feel crazy cramped when you sit down next to other ramen-eaters.
Now the important stuff: between myself and people that have come with me here, we've had just about everything on the menu. But I always keep coming back to their black garlic ramen and spicy garlic edamame. So delicious and fills you up really quick. This place can get a wait on the weekends but they do yelp waitlist so it helps avoid idle standing around outside.</review>

The food is so good that I would gladly drive to Orange just to eat here. Very clean restaurant. Clean bathrooms.
Alvin and Dumi are the chefs. They were great in taking care of special food allergies. Went above and beyond. Bill and Lucas take care of the customers.

One of the best Ramen places around Orange County. I finally got around to trying it and loved it. I got the Tonkatsu Spicy Miso with a level 2 spicy. It was very filling and I love the flavor. We also got the grilled Gyoza and was some of my fiance's favorite gyoza that she's tried, so we got a second order! The food came out super fast too. The gyoza only took a few minutes and then the ramen was shortly after that. I really enjoyed how much more they cooked the chashu as compared to other places. This place will be a definite return-to for me!</Text>

Food wise, I prefer my ramen noodles more on the thicker side than skinny. The pork broth was good, no doubt about it, but the noodle portions were on the skimpier side. I even ordered a side of rice to eat with the rest of my soup to have me somewhat full. I wouldn't mind trying other dishes next time if I'm around.

Service was half and half. When I was greeted, the orange shirt guy didn't seem like he was all together for the night, like putting less or half an effort. The girl, on the other hand, was great. She followed up with everything and was fast too. It was kinda busy around the time when I went as well.</Text>< pictures>

Have eaten here several times before and the Tonkatsu Black ramen was great.  Some of the best ramen in the area. 5star worthy. Delicious rich pork flavors in the broth.  I normally get spicy paste on the side and only add a little so as not to overwhelm the pork goodness.

However, today ordered the same ramen and the broth was terrible.  Some variability is to be expected but this was very poor.  Weak, barely any pork flavor, and an off taste.  I had to mix in all of the spicy paste just to make it palatable, and still had no desire to finish the bowl.

Probably won't be back.  Not worth the risk.< /text>

I came here on the weekend with friends to try this ramen out. We came around 2PM on Saturday and there was no wait at all. There is plenty of parking in the plaza. The restaurant looks very modern and nice, with plenty of seats.

I ordered the Tonkatsu Black which was just alright. The noodles were just alright, nothing too special. I felt like they did not add enough black garlic oil, they only put a bit on top of the chashu and that was it. I feel like the oil definitely made my soup tastier but I didn't really taste a garlic taste with it. The soup was creamy and it wasn't too heavy to drink. The chashu was alright, salty and tender. I wish that this bowl came with an egg, but you have to order it as a side if you want one.

Overall, the ramen wasn't bad, it was just okay. So if you're looking for a quick ramen fix, then definitely try this one out.</Text>

If I had to pinpoint the reason why I would come back here, it would definitely be for the service.

I wouldn't call them perfect, but they're so friendly you can't be mad at them. Every single employee had a smile on their face and that contagious attitude really kept my mood throughout my dinner.

Things I liked:
- The ramen is good. I ordered the tonkatsu black with a side of egg for $1.50. The broth was very hot and the entire bowl was delicious.
- The servers are attentive but not over-the-top. They came to refill drinks, ask if we needed anything else, etc etc.
- The California roll is a very generous serving!! The 8 rolls were very thick and had far more crab meat than rice. I love that!
- You get to choose between a small and large rice bowl or curry. The server recommended getting the large bowl because the small was not very filling, but I suggest only ordering the large bowl if it's the only thing you plan on eating. Otherwise, opt for the small.

Things I didn't like:
- The gyoza was sub-par. At the entrance of the restaurant, you'll actually get the chance to watch a video on how they prepare their gyoza, but I found that the pieces were not fried long enough. They were seared, but a little too soft for my liking. Taste-wise, they were fine, but I would pass on this for my next visit.
- The lighting in the restaurant is too bright! I know that's a bit too picky, but it kills the ambiance for me.

--
Overall, I did like my experience at Yoshiharu! Though it's certainly not an LA ramen shop, it certainly is a good contender for those in the OC area.< /Review>

Ramen was good and came out hot. Takoyaki was great too. Service upon entry was lackluster without a greeting and staff assumed we would just sign the clipboard outside. Men's restroom was not stocked with soap and paper dispenser was non functional.</Text>

I ordered Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen...very nice broth, chewy noodles, 2 slices of pork, assorted veggies in top. I had the pan fried gyoza as a side and it was absolutely perfect!
My sister had the Tonkatsu Black Ramen which has the garlic oil, chewy noodles, pork slices, and assorted veggie toppings and she ordered a side of egg in the ramen...all very good!  She ordered a side of chicken Kara-age which was nice though we both did not care for the sauce it came with.
Service was friendly and fast😁👍
Very nice lunch on a cold day!<//review>

We went in for dinner on a friday night and were seated quite quickly. The service was good and I personally liked the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. I ordered the Black Oil Garlic Ramen and it was pretty good. The Takoyaki was good also. Suffice to say I came in hungry and left very satisfied.< /Text>

This place may have good food but I won't get a chance to find out. Posted hours say closed from 3-5pm so it is reasonable to expect to get something to go at 2:45pm. I was sent away and told they close at 2:40pm. I guess I'll check out the other 9 best ramen from the OC Register and cross this one off my list.<//Review>

Had a couple lunches here the past couple months already. Can say without a doubt that   Yoshiharu's high rating is well-deserved, the food and service were always excellent. Personally, I recommend the shouyo ramen and tempura rolls, so do give them a try~<//review>

This good place to eat ramen, its small and doesn't get too crowded. I recommend ordering the black garlic ramen. The broth is very flavorful and well-seasoned.<//text>

Service and food were great. We were seated immediately and our order was taken quickly. I had the spicy miso ramen with level 1 spicy, which was pretty good. Would definitely order again on a return visit. Quite excited to have a good ramen restaurant closer to home than the regular spot in Costa Mesa.<//Review>

I didn't want to like them because they replaced one of my favorites since about 1980, Ralph's Submarine Sandwiches! Sacrilege? Yes. Treason? I know, but I couldn't help it. Best ramen in the city of Orange!<//Text>

A great Tonkotsu style ramen place. Be forewarned: Their spicy Miso option is by far the spiciest I've encountered, a delicious dish. They also have a lovely bacon thing going on with their pork.< /Text>

I love giving places 5 stars to support their service, but to account for every aspect, in this case - price, I must provide an honest and well-rounded review. The price is a little steep for ramen, which is always understandable as a means of supporting the location; however, when ramen is available from $6-8 for a bowl at many locations, it’s hard to pay upwards of $10 for a bowl. Regardless, it’s pretty good ramen considering the options/wait times at other places out there. The service is excellent. There’s one gentleman who provides exceptional service consistently - part of the reason why my father loves coming here (in addition to the 5 piece gyoza for $3 with any ramen bowl).  I forget his name, but I will update as soon as I remember. I wish there was the option to provide 4.5 stars because price does not weigh that heavily in my book, and this place checks off all the rest of my boxes. Clean, great/prompt service, low wait times, convenient deals, just a little high-priced for a bowl of ramen.< /text>

This place has some of the best ramen in town. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I recommend the tonkotsu black and if you have room left over try an ice cream macaron for dessert.<//text>

Super yummy ramen! Broth is creamy and rich! Filling and very satisfying.

The restaurant is pretty small. It has a very modern, contemporary feel with wall panels that change colors. They play EDM and very upbeat, clubby music</review>

Dining here is fast, efficient, and delicious (even at lunchtime peak)! Make sure to combo up your ramen with gyoza or takoyaki, but the karaage is also good.</text>

Food is good,  service is great.  This is the first ramen place I have ever been to and it did not disappoint.  The server was especially friendly and very helpful. She must have answered 12 questions with a smile.  I am visiting but if I am back in town I will most certainly come again.

I had the Tonkotsu Spicy Miso with extra noodles and extra broth.... both unnecessary as the portions are large as they are but if you do order them you get a full order of ramen to take home lol.  I also got the takoyaki.  Never had it before.  Flavor was really  good but the texture was a bit unnerving,  it looked like a hush puppy but was a little mushy on the inside and that may be how it's supposed to be, can't say since I've never had it before.
Overall very pleased.< /review>

(Translated by Google) For ramen fans this is "THE" spot! The atmosphere, the decor ... everything is there! I ate super well, it was super good!
This is the second of the same name that I try and still so satisfied!
Go ahead, it's so good, you won't regret it!

Pour les fans de ramen c’est « THE » spot! L’ambiance, la deco...tout y est! J’ai super bien mangé, c’était super bon!
