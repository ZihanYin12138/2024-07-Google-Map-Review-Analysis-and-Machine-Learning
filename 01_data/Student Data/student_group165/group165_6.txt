Awesome service and quality turf. Went to the store in San Marcos on Friday to get turf a week later came to San Diego location to buy infill. Both locations were friendly and helpful. Highly recommend good price and great customer service.<//Review>

Wow! My husband and I had one of the BEST customer service experiences at this Purchase Green, thanks to Alexandra and Israel! We walked into purchase Greens expecting to spend over $500 on good quality artificial grass for our small backyard (120 sq ft). Alexandra was able to find 2 remnants in stock of the grass we wanted (Arizona Platinum Spring) and for the dimensions we needed....at HALF OFF! We were mind blown and sooo thrilled! They also sell 50 lb. bags of infill for less than $20 each. And to top it off, Israel applied a 5% discount on military for the entire order. The grass is absolutely gorgeous and looks so real. We highly recommend Purchase Green for all of your turf needs, as they have a friendly staff, beautiful selection, and all the tools you need to complete your project!!</Text>

I would like to thank Israel for his quality product and great service. I had called a few different turf suppliers and Israel was the most personal of 5 different suppliers I called. Israel and Purchase Green is a company I will do business with again and highly recommend them for your turf needs or installation. Thank u Israel. Frank</Text>

<review>After looking and looking I went with purchase green. The staff was friendly and helped me out how much I needed. They even helped me guide where to cut so I don't have waste and enough turf for my project. This was a DIY and helped me load the sand and turf onto my small pickup truck. Will come back again soon for a putting green.< /review></record>

The whole experience working with Purchase Green could not have gone better. From the first call with Israel to find out options, up to delivery. I appreciated having several notices on timing, and scheduling without having to place another call.

The grass is beautiful and my wife loves it. A great combination. I highly recommend the company for their customer service, pricing and quality.<//review>

Purchased some bluegrass about a year ago, still looks great! Needed some more grass for a different area and was looking for something cool and softish for my daughter to play on. They were extremely helpful in finding something great for me and it was a lower cost than other options. I love it when a company does right by you even if they make less money. I got an estimate to have it actually installed vs just laid out and the person that came was super informative and I didn’t feel any sales pressure. I’ve now had 3 interactions and 2 purchases with them and I have only positive things to say! I will come back here for all my grass needs and highly recommend them. We absolutely love our grass. It’s in full sun all day and gets hot but not crazy hot. And it’s super comfy to play or lay on.< /text>

<Review>I would highly recommend Purchase Green. All of the associates were extremely helpful. Anthony in particular was quick to provide samples and explain the differences in turf. He helped us find exactly what we needed at the right price. The grass was delivered within a day of placing the order. Overall a great experience!</Review>< pics>

Purchase Green was exactly what we were looking for to complete a DIY project. After stopping by their showroom, they emailed us with an estimate of the turf and supplies within a couple hours. They advised us on where to get DG, and they stayed in touch while we were finishing prepping the area, which made our timing for picking up the turf seamless! They were always very kind and responsive over the phone and were always happy to answer our questions. Their online DIY guide was also super helpful.< /review>

<Review>We called Purchase Green first to see if they had a leftover piece for a small patio and they were very helpful in accommodating us. We will most definitely use them in the future for additional grass. Great to work with especially during the Covid epidemic.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I came into the store not knowing anything about artificial turf or putting green surfaces, Isreal was super helpful and knowledgeable aside from being super polite. I would definitely recommend this San Diego location from the experience I had.</Text>

<Review>We came here to check out the prices on turf. I was thinking maybe the reviews were inflated so I was skeptical.  They are not. The staff is very friendly and down to earth. The prices are comparable to the big box stores, but you get same day service here with one on one customer service. So far I'm very impressed with Purchase Green.< /Review>< Rating>

< Review>
I'm "SUPER" picky and a hard to please guy and this is the only vape shop I found that I really like. Everyone that works here are "Real" and friendly people that care for their customers. Tim is the owner and what ever you need he will take care of you. I've been a customer for a few years now and I love this shop. And if you like arcade machines they have a few of those inside the shop also. If you are looking for an "Authentic" vape shop you must come by and visit...</Review>

Very friendly and patient staff. They took the time to help me get my mod set up and gave me a few pointers on vaping and answered any questions I had. No misinformation or annoying upselling attempts at all. Will definitely come here again!< /review>

Worst experience of my life! I felt like an elementary kid at a new school. I'm no longer supporting this local shop. The first day I was treated well but the 2nd time I was scolded like a kid. FYI... it was really hard keeping my cool!< /Text>

I wasn't thrilled with the shopping experience. I was looking for a new dressy blouse and there wasn't a big selection. Mostly, casual and tshirts. Also looking for a graduation gift, but not much for ideas there. Shelves were kind of bare. For being a new store, I was not impressed.< /Review>

This store is organized and shout out to the cashier who helped me with my return today at 5:30pm. She is very nice. We bought lots of stuff and need a big bag to carry them out since they do not allow carts outside. She ran to the other station to get me a bag while her team leader who wore a plaid overall and black t-shirt and glasses seemed to be very mean. That lady kept insisting that there is no more big bags even though it’s obviously they have them at the other station. Oh well, at least my cashier is nice.<//review>

It is, busy at that time but they usually open additional registers.The store is pretty clean and the ppl working are helpful. The only thing I would change is asking ppl to step back and maintain distance while shopping 🛍 🙃< /review>< pictures>

The place hasn't opened yet but I spoke to someone working inside who said it's scheduled to open in about 2 weeks.  So early March.  Let's hope it's a good Ross.< /text>

I went in towards evening only a few people were in the store. They had four employees everyone was nice and the shelves we well stocked and everything seemed clean. They have a large parking lot as well. The one thing I do complain about is that while I was shopping the cashier came walking right pass me without wearing a mask, it was around her neck. Then I saw her later taking it off aging while she was right next to another customer. It made me uncomfortable.< /Review>

Very dumpy store.  Go in when they open and be ready for a bleach shower.  Your nose will burn throughout the store.  Produce usually is rotten.  They falsely advertise sales, like a special price with a purchase on the ad and then in store try to tell you how much you need to purchase, like $20.  Guess what, it's a country of laws and that not only bait and switch, but even the owner won't fix it when confronted.  Time to call the state to investigate.<//text>

As usual, great. Live their produce and especially the ready made foods, dolma meat or veggie grape leaves) or mest stuffed cabage for lazy people like me. Try the freshly made cheese puffs, fredh out of the oven and still warm but hurry they Don't last. Smaller market, family owned. Refershing compared to the other chain international grocery stores.< /Review>

Produce can be hit or miss. I wouldn't buy anything else since most other things are pricey. Very much a hole in the wall. Don't expect any type of customer service. Clerks are there to ring you up & nothing more. Ive done transactions where the lady doesn't say 1 word.

I usually only come here when I need something small for a recipe because its very close & convinient to me.</Text>

This market used to have quality items. Ever since the owners changed the quality has gone down to zero. They have rotten veggies and fruit at a high price. Get real. And the young girl at the register rips you off.  And they sell alot of turkish items. They should be ashamed of themselves.< /text>

<Review>Hello everybody!
This place used to be one of my favorites taco trucks. Lately it's been so frustrating to order because the guy behind the phone can't even take an order correctly and he has a bad mood, everytime I try to customize my tacos by adding beans he forgets to place the order with. Today they even gave me a wrong order and 2 of my tacos were filled with cilantro and onions only 😆... Good flavor, poor service 👎<//Review><Name>Carlos Diaz<//Name>< pictures>

Great tacos but they make their Cubano with grilled hotdog / salchicha. Wasn't a big fan of the dog in my sandwich</text>

Wow. If only you could try these now. Tortillas and sopes handmade on the spot. Carne asada was juicy and chard. Give them your money you won't regret it. Oh the wait can take 8 to 15minutes worth every second spent.< /Text>

Update:
Waited almost an hour for 2 quesadillas. Never coming here again. Unacceptable for a taco truck, no matter how good the food is.

Original review:
Food's good. But... What's the point of ordering ahead on DoorDash? Came to pick up my food, they only start making it once you've arrived and let them know. Even though DoorDash said to pick up at such and such time.</text>

Best taco truck I’ve ever been too. The spicy red and black(crazy spicy) sauce are Smokey and amazing. I actually get cravings specifically for their Al Pastor super quesadilla. Can be very heavy but that’s how you know it’s legit!<//Review>

FOOD TRUCK in corner parking lot for Mechanic biz.
$9 for a smallish "super burrito" with very little cheese and little sliced avocado, and $9 for a very generous "meat super quesadilla", so prices are a bit high even for a food truck not in line at the Broadway Caltrain Station car park.
But it is overpriced B-game.
Was there about 5pm last night and they were out of lengua and beans.
Three $2 tacos for dinner were good but old dry meat.
Their tortilla chips...not good.< /review>

Meat on the tacos tasted old and dry. Service is agonizingly slow. Size of the tacos would be best for a 2 year old. Asked for salsa, didn't get any, did get attitude from the staff. Don't waste your money on this poor quality experience.</review>

< review>
Me and my mom love these tacos and we come almost every Thursday, so much so that  they even know my name. Although this experience that I had will guarantee we won’t be coming back no matter how good the tacos. We ordered our tacos of various meats and then went to sit in the car to wait (since we know the wait is long because it’s busy) after about 20 minutes in the car we get out and waited in front of the truck. We see all the people that got there before us get there food and suddenly the people that had gotten there AFTER us started getting their food too. We gave them the benefit of th doubt and continued to wait. After a full 45 minutes I go up to the window to NICELY ask why we hadn’t gotten our tacos so my mom wouldn’t have to go up and be rude (she has quite the temper), I was completely ignored at first and when she finally did listen to be she seemed very unconcerned about what I had to say. When our order was found they proceeded to tell us the meat we want on our tacos ran out when we had been there for a whole 45 minutes. We got our money back and my poor mom had to rush back to work without eating lunch. I love this place but I am so disappointed.<//review>

I called ahead of time and was told my order would be ready in 20 minutes . I ended up waiting a frustrating 1 hour and 30 minutes to finally pick up food for coworkers. All the time lost for mediocre Burritos with flavorless meat. It’s ran by really slow staff indeed with low standards In food quality.< /Text>

The tacos coming out of this little trailer (you can't even call it a food truck) are 🍌🍌🍌BANANAS good. I prefer the cabeza - it translates to "head" and a lot of people are turned off by that because they think it's brains. No- it's delicious, tender, slow cooked beef cheek meat. Now you know. Tortillas are hand made right there. That makes all the difference, people. Everything is homemade.

There's a line in front at lunchtime every day; the people who eat here know good food. I couldn't recommend it more.<//text>

<Text>Simply my favorite place for Mexican food.

Ingredients are extremely tasty.

If you in hurry and come during lunch hours I suggest you call ahead and place your order. It takes about 30 to 45 minutes to be ready. Or you can come and Order at the spot and then take a walk in Hillsborough across El Camino Real, it feels like a walk in botanical garden<//Text><Time>1463841861408<//Time>< resp>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service the salted head meat there was no green sauce in my indispensable taste for these tacos close at 6:00 pm but at 2:30 they no longer have lemons (tacos without lemon for me are not tacos respecting different tastes) no there are canned sodas for the special that they offer you and the ones they have are hot pure red bull and those with more meats are very dry, I no longer came back the only good thing is the tortillas

(Original)
Pésimo servicio la carne de cabeza salada no había salsa verde en mi gusto indispensable para estos tacos cierran a las 6:00pm pero a las 2:30 ya no tienen limones (tacos sin limón para mi no son tacos respetando a los diferentes gustos) no hay sodas de lata para el especial que te ofresen y las que tienen están calientes puro red bull y las de más carnes  están muy secas, yo ya no regresó lo único bueno es las tortillas</review>

Thick tasty crust and lots of cheese. The sauce could have been better with some more oregano. If you need a quick bite and you're in the area, though, it's a solid option.<//text>

Quick casual place to grab a bite to go. Their Hawaiian pizza was pretty bomb and the slice was huge. It was fast and one slice came out to $5.</Text>

<Text>Horrible customer service! I ordered thru grubhub and was waiting over 2hrs for my food. Called the restaurant and was informed the driver didn't want to drive my address that is 10-15 min away. Apparently the driver did not want to do his job which is sad because they have good pizza. Lost a customer. Will not be referring them to anyone anymore.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

When I told the man I did not eat pepperoni, and asked for something else, the cashier (a tall, big white man who constantly removed his mask) told me to take this and there was no refund or change. He then literally confiscated my pizza when I asked for refund or change to chicken wings. The store owes me the money for the pizza I paid.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-m2zS32EZLloyLgfJbVthkH-QdM0NM1YVBMC4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

<text>One cheese pizza slice for $4.75 is outrageous & the quality was mediocre at best. 1 Star for being open, the other star is for the fancy little box they use to overcompensate for the quality of the food.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The guy that helped me was nice, but the whole experience was confusing. I wanted a chicken salad sandwich wrap. It was on the menu, but he began making a sandwich on a roll and it was chicken not chicken salad.<//text>

<review>I'd love to say it's worth the money but honestly the time it took the driver to get here was 2 hours after I ordered the pizza and at that point it was luke warm and our appetites had passed. I called 3 times to ask where our food was and she had to keep checking with the driver. When the driver finally showed up, he didn't say a single word. Not hello, I'm sorry, how's your evening or anything! My husband took the pizza, signed the receipt and shut the door on him.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Look, this place doesn't have the best pizza you will ever get. You're not going to write to your friends from your hometown and tell they they absolutely have to have pizza from Primo Pizza, but let me tell you this place holds up. They have an awesome two slices of two topping lunch deal and you can pick any two toppings you want including mix and match on the two slices. Don't seek this place out for good pizza, but if you stumble in, you won't be disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Another pizza place in the city with pretty high ratings that is AWFUL. Save yourself the headache, time, and meal- go somewhere else. The worst part was the employee was unhelpful and seemed inconvenienced by me being there at a normal business hour, just trying to get a slice for a late lunch.</Text>

<Review>Absolutely delicious. Got a small pizza with Canadian bacon, buffalo wings, and a slice of carrot cake. The food came to the table nice and hot. The pizza's crust was light, fluffy, and buttery kinda like Domino's pizza (but better). Will definitely be going back. They have a special going on right now where you can get an XL pizza for $19, too.<//Review>< rating>

The pizza by the slice is the only thing I have ordered here and it's it's decent but when you get a pizza by the slice they add the ingredients toppings that you ordered on top of an already made pizza slice and heated up. Almost certainly a large pizza made to order would be better but not faster. The people are friendly and I believe this is better then to Stella Dora pizza slice just two blocks down. Little Star might sell pizza by the slice during the day which would be better and I think seignories Pizza further down Divisadero has the slight Edge over Primo but it's close.</review>

Got these guys via delivery. I will say that the pizza itself was good & reasonably priced but BE WARNED ABOUT THE DELIVERY SERVICE. It is a third party service. I ordered ahead of time, they confirmed, and then 6 minutes before the delivery was scheduled, when I already had hungry waiting guests, they sent me an email that they had randomly canceled the order!! If you want their pizza, go in person, I will never order delivery from them again.< /text>

My family came up here from Southern California. This is a really small cute pizza place. The owner was here and was very friendly. The workers treated us like kings. But most of all the pizza was so thick juicy cheesy and great. I posted some pictures so you could see how good it really is</review>

<review>Primo is great...they have 1 slice and 2 slice deals w fountain soda for a good price.  Quality large slices, with plenty of menu options including salad,  poppers and mozz sticks, and cheesecakes.  Open till 12, 3am fri and sat.</review>< Pics>

This Pizza place is not more than 5 minutes away from where we are staying, yet every time we order delivery it takes forever.  The last time we ordered it arrived 30 mins late, and the pizza was cold when we got it. Definitely not impressed, and will not be ordering again.</Text>

<user_name>John S< /user_name><Text>Hmm, the slices are good. They're a good food joint, except when the chicken parm sub was recommended, and they made it with a preformed frozen chicken-based something-or-other to be cooked and presented as the meat. I took it home and really couldn't eat it. Gross and grizzly. How 'bout a real breaded chicken breast, folks?

And the owner makes no attempt to actually introduce himself by name to get to know me. I've had two interactions with him. If it were my business, I'd MAKE it my business to do that. But, whatever.

Oh, yeah, Kevin and the middle age kind shorter woman who works during the day are assets to the store and are very nice.< /Text><userid>109031878783533943838< /userid><Gmap_id>0x808580b1214fd029:0x109b63763e348e79<//Gmap_id></record>

My husband & I were ALWAYS short on $...but Primo's 2 slices & a soda deal for $7.00 (if I remember correctly..unfortunately we haven't been able to go for the last few months due to funds)..tonight We'll be able to get them!
Yeah..the service isn't the fastest, sometimes the new/new-ish guys screw up the order BUT they ALWAYS fix it, ASAP! When YOU started a new job, did YOU know everything about what YOU were doing? They make it RIGHT...& then some! BTW? EXCELLENT PIZZA!!!!!! I LOVE IT GINO..ESP WHEN YOU MAKE IT!!! 😀< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Come to the Donut Factory for NEVER ENDING DISAPPOINTMENT!! If you want a donut shop that is constantly sold out of what you want, you’ve come to the right spot! Stop on by for absolutely nothing you expect because they are already sold out of everything you might have wanted by 8:30 am.

Edit: if I could give this place zero stars I would.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Always in a bad mood ( I have been their customer for more then a year), I went to buy bingo lottery tickets, the lady said they didn't have any, they were right in front of me I saw them, and pick whatever and sold me those...since I had already paid her for the bingo ones. I am never returning to that store.< /text>

I recently had to call into freeway insurance and handle something and I got connected with Mrs. Wendy who has the best customer service I’ve had in years very considerate, dedicated, and seems too have your best interest at hand. We need more people to do customer service like Mrs. Wendy</Review>

I’ve been shopping around for car insurance had gone to about 4 or more different companies and the manager Roger and his teammate Diana were able to give me the lowest rate by far with the best friendly and professional customer service. I highly recommend taking your business to them. You won’t regret it!<//Review>

<Review>At Freeway Insurance located at 739 W Highland Ave. San Bernardino, CA 92405 Roger Garcia & Diana Chavez were absolutely AMAZING! Customer service at its best! They worked with my budget and provided me with great options. I left with the coverage I needed at an affordable price. I couldn’t be happier with my experience here.

Came here needing insurance fast. Roger Garcia was able to help me. He saved me big time on my upfront cost and was able to save me a couple of bucks on my rates each month. The process was pretty fast and smooth and I’m walking away with great coverage. I recommend everyone to come to him for help. Also make an appointment so you’re not waiting so long because they are busy.</Review>

I believe freeway insurance is the way to go they treat you like a family member well at least that's how i felt after speaking to the branch manager Roger Garcia, he was able to help me out today as far as my insurance. He was very nice and so were his workers. Offered me beverages, so down-to-earth and very professional the whole thing was professional from the moment i walked in to the moment i was wish to have a good day. Today went from a bad day to a great day and i don't think i had time to explain that to mr. Garcia as i was just excited and got up and left with the services i was provided today. Thank you freeway insurance and thank you
Roger. Special thanks to  karla and her co-worker< /review>

I was able to receive very affordable and reliable insurance. The customer service was great!  I was helped by Nancy Vallejo and she was terrific. I highly recommend looking into it especially if you are a under 21 and looking for insurance.</Text>

I am so happy with this service. I was not aware that this type of insurance search service even existed. My representative Karla Garcia was amazing! She was forthright and fast with finding the best policy for me. She was sure to check all my possible options before we settled on the best policy for me. Upon coming to her office to finish the deal she was even more efficient in that she was able to put together an even better deal for my needs. I am totally satisfied with my experience at Freeway Insurance and will be sure to recommend them to anyone I know for insurance coverage. Thank you Karla!< /Review>

He answer promptly and help me in minutes. to get the best coverage. even helped with a lower down payment. so that I can get driving legally. Staff was very helpful, kind, and respectful. Freeway Insurance was the only company to work with me and not give up do to out of state license and a ticket on my record Freeway is the way to go</text></record></dataset><record>

Freeway insurance on Highland  is the best experience you will ever have when trying to get insurance believe me I was trying All day. Then when I called freeway insurance  on Highland in San Bernardino I spoke with a  very nice lady named Nancy. She made sure she did everything possible to give me the lowest best rate and she was successful within minutes.  So she gave me the lowest best rate  ever you could only dream of.  Thank you so much Nancy. Thank you Lord.<//Text>

The agent Carla was very helpful and friendly, she was able to help me get an affordable insurance policy for my vehicles based on my budget. I thank her for taking the time to explain step by step the insurance information in the beginning. I do appreciate the service that she gave me. I just think it would be more delightful if I would have been greeted when I first walked in and I also would of felt more comfortable if I'd sign up first on the policy then pay after the insurance agreement!!! Not pay first then sign up on the policy... but I'm sure it's the office policy and not the staff members. Overall I am satisfied with my insurance policy and look forward to continue with their services. Thank you once again Carla Dimes.<//review>

I live in central Riverside and i drive all the way down to San Bernardino because I know its worth the drive. I always come to see Nancy. She wasn't here when I started coming but ever since she started working here I only come to her and no one else. She actually cares about you!! She isn't the typical sales person whose only interest is themselves or the ones who are too selfish to ask how you doing. She is real and genuine! She cares and will hunt down the best insurance she can find for you. If you come here ask for Nancy Vallejo because I can assure you you will walk out very happy!<//text>< pics>

The worst experience, I spend more than 2 hours waiting for a simply quote and when finally Claudia call me she was disgusting, she attended other clients while I was in the desk, she try to force me to buy an Insurance but I was the only for a quote!! And I told her, then she call her partner and she tried to scare me telling me about the risk for no have insurance, but I had, I was only there for a quote, I hate the places where Latino's are in charge in see another Latino (I'm Latino by the way) and think to sell you whatever no matter what because they thing that us as Latino are dummies and don't know our rights, the worst experience it was happens on June 5, 2018</review>

I got great service from Karla Garcia ! She's the best insurance agent i've ever had. She's honest, professional & very courteous. As far as i'm concerned, Karla should be the CEO of Freeway Ins ! She saved me a ton of money, everyone should go to her. She's the best.<//review>

< Review>
OK since the last time I've been here a lot of stuff has been cleared up from Mr. ANGEL.  where one person did not communicate effectively to me about my policy, Angel has explained fully and left me happy and no doubt wanting to continue my business with them.  Thanks.< /Review>

< Review>
I have been going to this gym since November and I love it! Everyone is so nice and helpful and there is no judgement. Everyone gets to work on themselves at their own pace and is encouraged to get stronger every day! I even started going at 5 am and this is the longest I've been able to stick with it at any gym or fitness center! My favorite part is I never have to worry about weights or a treadmill or a rower as they are numbered and have limited spots to sign up for. I never have a problem getting into a class! Can not say enough great things about this place!</Review>

I finally tried it because everywhere else I just couldn't get a good workout and I love group classes.  Yoga and pilates wasn't challenging enough.... I wanted more.  I love OTF because I can customize the workout to ME!  I can modify so that I can do the exercises and still get an amazing workout every, single time!  The staff at Fair Oaks is simply awesome and all the other members are so friendly.  Seriously, try Orangetheory.... you will love it!< /text></record>

I was definitely anxious on my first visit about going to a session with a trainer... today was my second visit now with a different trainer. This confirmed that at times a trainer doesn't necessarily cause the results to occur but to encourage! So overall I would like to say that it's worth giving a shot! I was unsure about returning but today inspired me to continue the physical activity monitored by a trainer. I am recovering post Traumatic brain injury, out of a coma able to walk and talk! I must say thank you God for this ability to increase my physical ability beyond what was expected by my physical therapist. Let's just say... if you don't trust reviews or others opinions come in and give it a try! Yes it's easy to assume that it's not effective but what it comes down to is to push oneself to the orange zone which requires self discipline. No reason to blame anyone else but oneself when results don't change! Pay attention to the monitor on your hand and if it's in the green zone more work is required! I purchased an 8 pack (will be my abs one day) which leaves me with 7 more sessions to attend. Looking forward to it, seeing additional folks in the sessions will be pleasant!<//Text>

<user_name>Mathew Nickels<//user_name><text>OTF is an amazing experience! I’m from Fresno and was up here for a meeting. I recognized Kendra as a former trainer from our Fresno location and books a class with her. Even though my membership was through the Fresno location I was able to book a class for free here in Fair Oaks. The staff was courteous and Kendra was amazing. She was “nice enough” to kick my but with a workout I would remember. Thanks for the awesome experience! I will be back soon!!< /text>< Rate>

I like this place! The staff are very friendly, personal trainers provide us with the right instructions, and other members are very nice too.
The high membership prices was behind the 4 stars rating, otherwise the place deserves 5 stars.< /Review>

I LOVE Orangetheory.  The workouts are killer, both in difficulty and fun, but every day is different.  The coaches are all so great and they really push you to your limit so you are constantly improving.  It's also great having someone tell you what to do the whole time based on the day's particular workout.  All you have to do is follow their lead and push yourself and the results come.< /Text>

What do I love about Orange Theory Fitness in Fair Oaks, California?
The variety from day to day. You can count on it only taking an hour out of your day. The enthusiastic and friendly manager, coaches and staff at Fair Oaks. The fun extra activities like Hell Week and burpees breast cancer fund raiser (although I shouldn’t characterize Hell Week as fun). Leaving there feeling like I got a full workout.</Text>

<username>Christina Jones<//username><Gmap_id>0x809ae0d32e2fbd7d:0xf2b69ee09069db5e</Gmap_id><review>First Timer! I tried orange theory fitness today for my first class and it was a lot of fun! I read about it online before I went so I kind of had an idea of how their system works but once you get there they go into way more detail. My first impression was that the studio was very clean and organized which is always a perk.  I arrived 30 mins early and they went over my paperwork and goals with me.  Casey was my trainer today and he showed me how to use their treadmills and row machines before class began. The 60 minute class went by pretty fast and your always moving except for 30 seconds rest in between certain workouts. The workouts are challenging at least for myself who hasn't worked out consistently in a long time. Casey was a great trainer, motivating and checking in with everyone working out throughout the class. At first I felt a little intimated by the different machines and getting the hang of things but picked up on it pretty fast. I enjoyed the different workouts that we did today and the fast pace of things to keep your heart rate up and burning calories.  They play loud music too that helps keep you motivated and keep you going.  After the class Casey went over my class stats with me and what they meant. I purchased 4 classes in a month package just to start but I can see myself going more often if my schedule allows. If your interested in trying it out I say go for it! I burned 600 calories in 1 hour and that's way more than I would burn working out myself at my other gym.</review><date>1530289982302</date></record></dataset><record>

This was an amazing workout... I burned almost 550 calories in only an hour. I have been going to my local gym ( cal fit) for years. At first I was skeptical about this type of workout, but after just one class I signed up for 6 more weeks of unlimited classes! Definitely worth it!<//review>

<review>So happy Orangetheory moved into my Fair Oaks/Orangevale neighborhood. I love the workouts. Each one is different and you use a variety of equipment from treadmill and rower to TRX, resistance bands and weights. The coaches not only help you succeed but push you beyond what you thought was possible. And it’s fun! Everyone supports each other.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>I am absolutely in love with Orange Theory Fitness! I can honestly say that the Coaches and Company care sincerely about our success. I'm fairly new and can feel extremely self-conscious at times however, I'm super encouraged and believe that I CAN lose weight with OTF's support. I am working on my consistency and enjoy each and every class! Thanks again for a wonderful and supportive community of people willing to provide an encouraging atmosphere where I am able to put forth the effort! #KeepBurning<//review>< rate>

It’s been years since I’ve felt so good (and strong).  At first I was intimidated as I’m 20 years older than most of the people in class, but it works for me as OTF workouts allow for all levels.  And the Coaches are always available to give a modification if needed.  The facility, equipment, and staff are top notch!  Give OTF a try... you’ll be hooked.<//Text>

<Review>Before going to Orange Theory I didn’t know much about heart rate zones or what HIIT workouts were. Now I realize the importance and am able to work out according to my specific goals. The coaches are all motivating and I look forward to each class I attend, regardless of who is running it! I LOVE Orange Theory and recommend everyone atleast try it out.<//Review>< pictures>

I went to attend a personal training session and had a blast! They go over your goals and fitness level without judgement. I haven't worked out in a while and figured I'd creep out after 10 minutes but the trainer stayed by my side the entire 1 hour session. We did a little of everything with upbeat music in the background. It was as fun as it could be and I was so sore the next day (in a good way). I reccomend this place to those looking for a place to get fit< /review>

There is a nominal $12.00 charge but that wasn’t disclosed.
Even after I specifically asked clarification and was told the class was free at the conclusion it was disclosed a $12.00 for use of the fit bit.< /Text><GmapID>0x809ae0d32e2fbd7d:0xf2b69ee09069db5e<//GmapID><user_name>Trisha Leskody< /user_name>< resp>

I can't say enough good things about this OTF. The coaches, front desk and members are all there for one another, always supporting and encouraging each other. Its like a little family! There's no judgement like big box gyms feel and everyone can work at their own pace. May seem a little pricey but it's cheaper than personal training yet the outcome is very comparable!<//Text>

OTF is the best workout. I have no one to beat but myself. The progress is amazing! I didnt run before (could barely walk very long) and now I run! I did a ton of modified activity and now hardly anything is modified! OTF keeps me encouraged and always makes me WANT to hit new milestones and new personal bests in miles, inclines, times, and weights. You CAN'T stay stagnant here!</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I started going to OTF to get in shape for my wedding in December of 2017. I bought a wedding dress that everyone had loved but I didn’t feel like myself in it. I didn’t know a ton about OTF in the beginning but my first trainer, Jen, said all I had to do was dedicate myself to 3 classes a week and I would get to a point I was happy in my dress. From first fitting to last, the seamstress took 4 inches out of my dress! I cried for the first time upon seeing myself. Even though the wedding is over, because of OTF I feel strong, beautiful and capable of conquering each day. The members and other staff are all so friendly and I cannot imagine a better fit for me while pursuing my health and fitness goals.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Super helpful! I regret I didn’t go to them sooner instead of wasting my time with the dealership at first. They help you fast and are super friendly and respond to any of your calls and emails in a timely matter. Hands down the best attorneys out there highly recommend.<//text>

I found Lemon Law attorneys on Google and decided to give them a try based on their great reviews. They were very professional, responsive and sympathetic to my situation. I would recommend to anyone who is stuck in a sticky situation with a car dealership!</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>The Lemon Law Attorneys were amazing. Went to other attorneys and they carried not interest, stated I didn't have a viable case, etc. At the Lemon Law Attorneys, they carefully reviewed my case and were honest from the beginning. This law firm was very informative, receptive, and communication was on point. Never did I ever feel that I didn't understand a process or what was going on. If anyone is needing a Lemon Law Attorney, I would definitely recommend The Lemon Law Attorneys!</text>< pics>

my experience with everybody was amazing. hassle free, professional, & super easy going. they explained everything in depth & made it easy to understand. I was even able to have a 20 minute conversation with steve about what not to do with my next car purchase & he even offered to help me out with advice since I obviously didn't make the right choice with my first car. made the right choice by going to them.< /review>

I had a Ford Focus with transmission issues. I contacted them without any references so I was a little nervous I might have ran into a bad lawyer office, but they were great I was able to do everything by email, and phone I never set foot in the office. After eight months I got a settlement from Ford I paid 16k for my car and I was able to get 13k back. I am very pleased with the out come and their work they did on my part.<//review>

<text>We were unfortunately sold a brand new vehicle that had several malfunctions. We were worried, stressed and most of all upset that this vehicle was failing us. We contacted The Lemon Law Attorneys in order to get advice about what to do with our situation. The Lemon Law Attorneys responded and acted quickly to get us through this process. I must say, everything was said and done in a matter of months. We received every penny we paid on the vehicle back to us and throughout the entire process we were kept updated and checked up on regularly. Thank you guys for the help. I want to directly thank Ivan, Susan, Molly and Jean for making this process easy and for providing professional customer service.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>I am extremely satisfied in my decision to have The Lemon Law Attorneys represent me with the issues my new vehicle was causing me. From the Attorneys to the Assistants and everyone in between, they all made this experience very comfortable. They were all very helpful. You must also have patience during this long process and trust, because believe me this law firm will get you what you deserve and then some. I thank you all who assisted me and I appreciate all that you did.<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>I am so thankful for the team at The Lemon Law Attorneys. We were having LOTS of mechanical problems with three of our vehicles and really just didnt know what to do.

The expenses were taking a toll on our finances not to mention time loss of work if a vehicle had happen to break down on our way to work.

I reached out to see if there was any way we could be helped.  They evaluated our situation and said yes we had a case. The whole process was smooth, the team was very thorough and explained everything to us.

We were so pleased with the outcome of our case. The compensation was more than expected and it is such a relief to no longer worry about unreliable vehicles.<//review><time>1613453521469</time>< name>

Love how professional they were with me on my case. All my questions were answered clear, simple and with care. They never made me feel rushed on any of my decisions and always felt they were fighting the most for me. This is the first time ever going through a lemon law case and I’m so happy it was with this great group of team. I’m thankful for the person who recommended them to me and I would do the same!<//text>

<Text>Outstanding job by this firm to obtain a settlement for me on my car, one I’d had several issues with for nearly a year.

They constantly communicated, even though the entire process took several months (especially due to everyone working from home during the pandemic).

I highly recommend them.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
The lemon law attorneys were great during a stressful time in my life. I needed a another car desperately due to having so many mechanical issues, even though it was fairly a new car (2017). I felt like I had to rush into buying another lease at the dealership when I knew more could have been done. It didn’t help that if I didn’t make a decision, I wouldn’t have a car to go home,etc. I found the lemon law attorneys and they helped me through the process fairly quickly without having to worry about the situation at all. I just went about my everyday life while they were negotiating with corporate. They were able to update me and compensate me a good chunk of what I felt was comparable for my troubles. Something is always better than nothing!! They do really try to get you the most back and I can’t really complain. I hope no one is stuck with a lemon situation but if life finds you to that, I recommend their services and commitment to you.< /Review>

Absolutely fantastic work. I had a motorcycle I purchased brand new and I was have a catastrophic transmission issues. After 5 months of the motorcycle being in the shop, I decided to search around to get my money back.

The Lemon Law Attorneys did a fantastic job of explaining what was going to happen and in what time frame.  They fulfilled what they promised to do and I am very grateful.<//Text>

I had so many problems with Ford and my Ford Focus 2014 and Ford wasn't helping me. I got referred to The Lemon Law Attorneys and they instantly started giving me the help I needed. I got a buyback for almost all the money I had already paid plus my GAP. I always got call backs and updates throughout the whole case. I definitely recommend if you need good attorneys.</review>

The lemon law attorneys were extremely  Helpful.  They  would contact me to let me know where we were in the  Process along the way.  I would have never been able to do this myself or been able to get the results that they did.. I received a very fair deal thanks to the lemon law attorneys   I would highly recommend them!<//review>

Rip took over 45%  I got 11k he got 10k
And he not even had a court appearance
He took the pandemic as advantages ...
I contacted the Bar for to look of the right of the case ...Lawyer Explained it would not matter the manufacturer will paying his part...nonsense...When I got the check it was from the lawyer not from the manufacturer ...As I signed to the beginning
6000 not 10000 I am a little confused but I'm not so sad about it 11k is ok for right now..< /Review>

Best decision i could have made in choosing them to work on my case. They are very patient with any questions you have. Ruben Marquez is such an amazing person, even though i never got to meet anyone in person, they make you feel you can trust them with you situation. Everything was smooth with my case, i would positively 100% recommend them to anyone. They are a team you can definitely trust and they will try their best to give you the best outcome.< /review>

<Text>My experience with the Lemon Law attorneys was all positive, from the initial consultation to the settlement. The initial consultation concerning the situation with my Ford Fiesta was honest and laid out all my options and potentials. No false hype, just honest advice. They didn’t promise the moon, just that they would do the best they could. The process was close to nine months I believe, but in the end, Mr Romano was able to have Ford buy back my car at full price with 140,000 miles on it (!) Now I know that this may or may not be typical, but I could not have asked for a better outcome, obviously. Everyone I dealt with at the law office were professional and helpful. Awesome experience.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The Lemon Law Attorneys were recommended by a friend that has used them twice w successful results. I have to agree. They helped me recover almost all of my money from a bad Ford Fiesta 2012 purchase. It was an easy n relatively fast process. As long as u have all the paperwork n present it to them (I did everything over the phone n email) they will let u know if u can win or not. Very honest n friendly. N it’s 100% free of charge. Didn’t pay a dime. Very happy w the results n the entire process. Highly recommend them!<//Text>

<review>The Lemon Law Attorneys were very helpful and sincere the whole time of the process. They were able to get my family and I out of a lemon car as fast as possible with little to almost no involvement from us. My wife just recently gave their information to two of her friends once they found out we had a lemon car and what we had done and with who. I would definitely recommend them to anyone that is driving a lemon car, for their safety and the safety of their families. Peace be with you.< /review><rate>5</rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

Honestly one of the best choices I made. I contacted the Lemon Law attorneys a while back. Nearly a year and a half ago. I had a 2013 Ford Focus that I bought from CarMax in 2015 and from the get go i had fatal transmission issues. The lemon lawyers were very transparent with my situation and took the time that I needed in order to understand the legal proceedings. While the process took long and I wasn't happy with the way Ford was treating me, I was very comfortable with my lawyers. They had the knowledge and expertise to predict the outcome of my case from day one. I recommend anyone with a lemon to contact the lemon lawyers and see if they can help you. It may be a drawn out process, but it was well worth the wait.<//Text>

< Review>
After experiencing a continual issue with a new automobile, I elected to seek the help of the Lemon Law Attorneys.  I was apprehensive if they could offer any help and was concerned if there was truth to the "no cost to me" policy.   I simply submitted the automobile's repair invoices which the attorneys reviewed and determined there was a case against the manufacturer.  The case was resolved in our favor with not one penny out of my pocket for attorney fees.  If you feel that you need legal assistance in resolving issues with an automobile that is a "lemon",  do not hesitate to get the Lemon Law Attorneys involved.  They are great people to work with and are there to help you.< /Review>

I am so grateful to these attorneys for contacting me regarding the lemon of a car I had with Chevy Cruze. I knew it was a lemon just after the first year, but I thought the statutes stated that claim had to be made within the first year. So I never contacted GM and continued to have many problems with that car. A true LEMON!

Within 5 months of hiring Lemon Law Attorneys (at no cost to me), I received a great settlement for which I returned my 4 year old car to GM, and bought a new car!

These attorneys handled my case well, (they were competent -knew what they were doing) kept in good contact with me, (great communicators, reliable) and did what they said they would do- get me a good settlement, for which I never had to pay them a penny, just as their contract stated (trustworthy). They work as a great team- I spoke with each one of them at one point or another. Their front desk staff, Jean,  was also easy to work with and a reliable communicator as well.

Bonus- they are very nice people. I would not hesitate to hire them!< /Text>

Thank you very much for helping us!! It was a pleasure working with everyone there. I had a very difficult last year with Nissan with a lot of issues and could have never expected to actually get something back from the huge headaches they have caused! Thanks again for a wonderful experience and your outstanding customer service!! We really appreciate it.</Review>

<text>I had done my research regarding lemon law as well as searching for a firm to represent me. The Lemon Law Attorneys were recommended to me from a family friend. I called and asked my questions and they explained to me different scenarios that could happen. I am happy to say that they walked me through the process and kept me in the loop. If I had any questions I could email or call them and get a response. I am very happy with their work and the outcome. We faced a small obstacle towards the end of my case and they heard me and had my best interests as a priority. I will definitely be recommending them to family, friends, and even strangers that might have purchased a lemon vehicle.
P.S.
You must be patient as this process requires a lot of patience and the Lemon Law Attorneys definitely emphasize that. If you have a case they will let you know and represent you well. Remember be patient!< /text>< Response>

<review>The experience I had with the Lemon Law attorneys was amazing.  The work they did to get my claim settled, was quick and to my satisfaction. They kept me informed at every turn and their advice was great. I could not have anticipated how well they worked. If I should ever have another problem of this sort, they are my first call.<//review>< Pics>

Thank you so much for all your help. Things got finished a lot faster than expected and they went over and beyond to help me. I would highly recommend using them if you have a Lemon, and I hope you don't. But if you do... they are the ones to help! Thank you once again The Lemon Law Attorneys!!!</Review>

Hands down to all the staff and attorneys that work here. Called them and told them my issues with my 2015 dodge rt Durango and they told me I had a case. It took them about 4 months and sooner than I thought my check was at my front door. They got me all my money back.. I definitely recommend them. Thank you once again no more nightmares with a dodge<//text>

The Lemon Law Attorneys are amazing! They made sure my case was a speedy process, Also that I got my money back and got the best deal possible for my Lemon car.

<Review>Professional no-fuss representation. They explained up front how the process would proceed, how long it would take, and what can be expected. As represented in their ads, they are paid by the car company and, when the case is settled, there is full disclosure on how much they are paid.
After you explain your case and scan/submit all relevant documentation, the process is painless.< /Review>< Pics>

It was something the vehicle brand corporation said they could not help me because the issue was been fixed under warranty. I did not feel safe so I call up the attorneys i explained to them my problem and if they could help. They called me back and told me they would help me out. No charge to me if the case failed. If you have any doubts of your car been a lemon you should not hesitate to call. Many workers helped me out from this firm :Ruben Marquez, Tim Whalen, Jean Akin, and many more great helpers</Text>< Pics>

Settle my dispute on a used vehicle that was still under warranty. I was actually pretty relieved because I purchased vehicle out of state and thought that would possible effect the outcome of my case. I retained pretty much everything on vehicle and wasn't stuck with loan/used lemon.  I used money and got into a 2018 Zl1 camaro, thanks to lemon law attorneys.<//Text>

Very easy to deal with; straightforward, ethical, and prompt.  When they said it would not cost us anything, they meant it.  So painless and easy it was almost unreal.  Very recommended!< /Review>

The Lemon Law Attorneys did a Great job! They answered all my questions in a timely manner, and were very friendly. The manufacturer of my vehicle bought back my lemon, and awarded me a settlement. The turn in process at end only took about 30 min.<//Text>

This is a very professional company to work with, I would strongly recommend this firm to anyone in my inner circle. They were patient with educating me throughout the entire process and didn't require me to pay a dime. Then fought for me the entire time while i lived my own life with no interruptions... Peace of mind and a cash pay out, theres nothing in life left to ask for.

5 stars for sure, thanks again for all the help. I went from driving a defected mediocre 2017 4 cylinder tacoma to a 2018 TRD Off Road , do the math.<//Review>< Pictures>

Food is okay, wish they had more variety for the $5.99 value duet special.

Sometimes the curbside pickup takes 10-15 minutes longer than your pickup time.

Bakery items are good, the orange scone, brownie, cinnamon bun, bear claw and chocolate croissant are my go to.

Portions are small and overpriced.

They do taste good though.

I’m recommending the:
Broccoli cheddar Mac and cheese
$5.99 tuna and soup
Turkey chili
Napa Chicken salad sandwich
Blood Orange Refresher

Tuesday Bagel special is good, I recommend getting the honey walnut cream cheese.

WiFi is good so if you want to eat in your car it covers the parking lot.</Review>

The lady who helped me was really nice - she gave me instructions to both keep us safe and she was very helpful.
Too bad there's not a way to leave a tip in the receipt 🤷 they have tip jar but don't carry cash anymore since pandemic started.</Review>

My half sandwich was so small it was more like a 1/4 of a sandwich. My companions sandwich was not made very well either. Terribly disappointed.</text>

Seems like everytime I order something from here, I get half the portion. The containers never look full and looks like someone just threw your food together just not giving care. I paid for a meal, not scraps of it. I ordered a bread bowl and the sent me a half full cup of Mac and cheese to put in my bread bowl...kind ruins the fun of a bread bowl. Any how, I will be going to a different location from now on.< /Review>

<text>The young lady that was there to ‘help’ us complete the kiosk order process was no where to be found when I needed her. The guy preparing the orders had a very bad attitude or perhaps a very bad day, regardless it made me uneasy that he was in charge of our food preparation while nursing a lot of anger. The onion soup was horrible, the croutons were moldy, the cheese was old, the broth was foul. The sandwiches were thrown together...literally. I understand the pandemic was hard on all of us but if you work in an establishment where customer patronage is a lifeline, please step up and make an effort to care about the people who took a chance to venture out and chose your business to do so. The second star was solely for the manager, she was friendly snd professional while trying up manage the crew and impatient clientele. The young lady and young gentleman working the distribution section and beverages were very nervous but super friendly and trying their best to ignore the slowly growing chaos. Kudos to the manager (didn’t get her name, working shift on 9/26/20 around 2 pm). I hope Panera gives her a raise and better food prep staff. Panera, what happened bro? 😬<//text><gmap_id>0x808f914094fdfb0d:0xee9364d8ccb35c<//gmap_id>< Response>

<Text>I havent been to Panera since long before Covid. The procedure for ordering is posted but I was focused on the pastries and walked up to the counter. An employee came over and patiently directed me to the ordering kiosk and walked me through it. The order was ready in 5 minutes. All were  packaged individually with name tags identifying pastry types. Yummy pastries, although a bit overpriced, at 3.29 per pastry. Great customer service!</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

4 Star Overall.

- Coffee is lackluster
+ Panera added a subscription plan for $8.99 a month for coffee every 2 hours if you like.  Get my caffeine fix for a fixed price.
+ Self order kiosks are great if you just want a drink or don't want to wait in line.
+ Power plugs everywhere.
+ Decent wifi speeds.
+ Friendly service.
+ Not too crowded, usually easy to get a seat. (Inside and Out)
+ Available / easy parking<//Text>

Good service, bad food for the day, salad had brown lettuce. Manager didn't come out to check on me after I sent it back. When I was leaving asked for contact for general manager, she came out and said she was on the line.< /Review>

They have great food , and that's all cause the service  is bad. The tables are all dirty. You have to find someone to clean it . They just leave you alone after bringing your food to you.  If you need something from them you have to Actually go look for them all over the place. They do their work half heartily.  It's great place if the service dose not get u mad by the time you finish eating.</review>

<text>Very disappointed with todays experience. I always come here because they have good service, good food,  and clean place. But today i ordered using their rapid pick up to take some food to go. When i got home i opened my sandwich and got two slices of salami on my italian sadwich. What happened to all the meat?! I was really upset since i was really looking forward to it.</text>< gmapID>

<Text>8:45 am on a Saturday and they ran out of coffee at the station. I had to tell one of the staff. They were out of cream  as well. I used the kiosk to order and pay. It took forever, but not nearly as long as waiting in line. The people are nice enough, but the service is very slow.  Coffee is good, though. Panera is a place to go if you don't have to be anywhere anytime soon.< /Text>< username>

I love Panera Bread as a franchise because their menu is great. However, the one at Southland Mall in Hayward has messed up my orders too many times for me to now write a review. Today, I ordered a soufflé at the kiosk only for them to tell me it's still cooking so they asked if I would like 2 breakfast sandwiches instead. I was like fine. NP. I asked for a brioche with sausage, egg & cheese. They still messed up and didn't include the sausage!!!😠 I bet their manager knows my phone number now so I'll just be ordering from another Panera now henceforth.</Review>

< Review>
Food comes prepared in bags so a special order that requests no mushrooms will not be available as the staff do not have the time to pick out the shrooms from the already prepared food.  I mean if you ordered the food with a special request that you state no mushrooms you would think that the staff putting together all the fresh ingredients would be able to not put in that item but its all already prepared beforehand.

Do not like.</Review>

<text>I'll admit, I usually dont like coming to Panera because nothing usually looks appetizing to me and it seems overpriced. However, when I was there recently they had a bigger selection and the food i ordered was delicious. Still a bit pricey though but worth it for the grilled cheese or any of the mac n cheese options.</text><user_name>Ciera Hady< /user_name><Time>1561057436990</Time></record></dataset><record>

Went in for their strawberry, poppy seed and chicken salad and they didn't have any strawberries. They added canned pineapple and mandarin sections instead. If you're going to feature certain items on your menu then you should order enough supplies or go buy some at the store</review>

<review>Good dessert options. I visited to order a couple scones and left with a box of half a dozen different pastries. So delicious. Join their club to earn points and get offers. Just for joining, I earned a free cookie to redeem at a future time. I ordered a sour dough loaf, which the cut into thick slices for me. The best sour dough bread ever!! Simple toasted with butter was how I enjoyed it. Mmmmm...nice people and clean restaurant.<//review><resp>None<//resp><user>106583802206761544018< /user>< Gmap_id>

I enjoy Panera very much, but they will always be missing one star until they bring back their old lemonade. I know, it sounds petty, but it was really good. This new one is not bad, just not good enough for that last star. 😉<//Text>

Turkey chilli is fantastic. Salads, sandwiches.  All really good.  Pastries too. Don't miss this place. Don't think of it as fast food from a chain. The food there is way too good for that.< /text>

Wow this place is yummy.  Love the option of half and half which I usually get a sanwhich and salad (or their broccoli cheddar soup).  Has some breads/pastries too.  I like the convient self order stations too, when they are working.</Review>

Honestly pretty good, not too busy except weekend mornings where they are the busiest. Sometimes the line is almost out the door, so be prepared for that and even their to go line is long as well. My only problems would be that and sometimes their machines used to order don't work but other then that, i like this place and has a cafe, starbucks vibe.< /Review>

Ahh, but everything looks so good on the commercials.  Sandwiches are ok. Salads are good but expensive. Soups not so good. Canned is better. Cookies and bagels I like. Atmosphere and service not as inviting as it could be.<//review>

The value you get for your money is not there.

We order pickup from them and we ALWAYS have to check our order even though they have someone there whose job is ONLY to check food..

Our grilled cheese sandwich not only was not toasted, it also had the wrong bread entirely. A wheat bread grilled cheese? Really?

Our macaroni and cheese also had macaroni but we were unable to locate any cheese, it seriously looked like they served it with a slotted spoon to make sure all the cheese dripped off of it.

The only thing in our latest order that was correct was the tomato soup..but I had to ask for the croutons...like I have to do 80% of the time we pick up.

I think this was the last straw for us, the low value, high cost, and constant mistakes do not make this place worth it.<//Review>

Good food, quality. It is popular at lunch and takes a long time to place order, difficult to find a table... but worth the time and wait.  I go with coworkers at least once a week.<//Text>

The service here was excellent. At one point, they ran out of hot water for tea. I was looking around for someone to tell so that they could fill it up, and one of the servers immediately stopped to ask what I needed. When I told her, she brought me a cup of hot water so I wouldn't have to wait.<//review>

This sandwich was horrible.  Could of and should of made a better sandwich at home.  I had a turkey sand on what looked like beat up slices of wonder bread.  Two tiny pieces of bacon.  Lettuce ?? I guess those couple of slivers count.  And hardly any sauce.  So dry needed water to wash it down.</Text>

The selection was varied, the staff friendly, Saturday morning atmosphere calm and family-friendly,  however,  dine-in service can be more organized. The cost is better than Starbucks when factoring in atmosphere and  quality of menu items.</text>

I'm starting to not want to come here anymore every time I order online I have a problem. it's always something missing when I pick up. for example, the pickle to the sandwich, the utensils  (even though they check it off), the correct side,  the extra dressing that I request, etc. yesterday I ordered a southwestern salad. everything seemed ok till I tried eating it! how do you put half of the dressing in the container? I didnt even have enough dressing for my salad that I had to use ranch. what is the point of buying a salad with your company if I can never get my dressing and not even the amount in your own recipe.< /review>

<text>This has to be one of the least organized locations! I had a phone order for 14 sandwiches which I had placed early in the morning. When I went to pick up at the scheduled time, they knew nothing of the order. When I got tired of waiting,  I asked to speak to the manager. It took her awhile to find my order and assured me that they were working on it.  If they were working on it, why wasn't it on their screen in the que? Why was everyone picking up their orders when they should have been working on my order.  20 minutes late, no apologies, nothing. As I said, one of the worst run restaurants.<//text>< Pictures>

It was my first time here, I didn't eat actual food but my son did and he seemed to enjoy their Bacon mac and cheese 😁 (a lot) haha. And of course their Chocolate croissant is THE BEST.</text>

Food is good, but they tend to leave out items from my salads and my bread. They need to put all the loose foods that are behind the counter, inside a bug - free containers/cabinets. I went in to buy cookies but flies were Lansing on them. It was so damn gross!< /Text>

The only problem I seem to ever have is they never have fruit bowls left when I get there. Other than that staff and hosts/service was good and very friendly.</text>

I love Panera's food.  It always seems to be good quality and come in appropriate portion sizes.  I have taken to using the self serve kiosks at the Hayward location and it is working out well for me.  They do not seem to have an appropriate way to package bagels anymore though.  They used to come in this perfect box/bag with a handle... now you have to stick your hand into a bread bag to get one which might be okay, if you didn't just order a dozen of the cinnamon crunch bagels.  You just end up with a sticky arm.<//review>

<Text>I have lunch at Panera at least once a week and I have always had a great experience and delicious food. I figured I'd finally write a review since I eat at their restaurant so often. The service is excellent and you receive your food very fast. Even during the lunch hour rush you get in and out very quickly. The sandwiches are absolutely terrific. My favorite is the chipotle chicken. I recommend this restaurant to everyone in the Hayward area.</Text>< pictures>

The good: Nice and friendly staff, clean and well maintained place, not too warm and freezing like some other Panera breads out there.
The bad: It can get super loud to the point of discomfort. I don't mean the music or anything I'm talking many big groups all talking really loud at each other.
The ugly: The wifi speed is absolutely horrendous!! It's so bad you feel like a time traveller back to the dial-up age. Basically you have no internet here so be aware of that...<//Text>

Worst service ever. Waited 30 minutes for a sandwich and when it was received it was soggy bread and pretty much a "salad" because everything was all jumbled up in the box. I wopulent recommend going there, especially if you don't like waiting.</Text>

This was the worse meal I've ever had eating out! I ordered a quinoa and kale salad and a grilled cheese sandwitch. Could not eat the salad as they had vinegar all over it! That's the only thing I could taste is strong vinegar. So unedible! The grilled cheese sandwitch? What grilled cheese sandwitch? It was 2 slices of dried up bread not toasted, barely any butter on the bread and inside 2 slices of dried up unmelted cheese!  So pitiful! That pitiful sandwitch cost $7.19.
Also, what's with that unedible vinegar salad?< /Review>

<Review>This is the dirtiest Panera I've even been in and it's been holding that for the last 2yrs, how can their food be clean if part of their job is to clean the whole restaurant... I've seen gas stations with cleaner restrooms.  Look closely you'll see the days old crap on the wall.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm agreeing with the woman who said " I'm sticking with Safeway for sandwiches and Starbucks for coffee".  Both the Fremont CA and Hayward, CA locations are not stores I am happy with. And that speaks for the few times I've gone to each.< /Review>< gmapID>

< review>
Today was my first and last time visiting this Location. I Normally go to the Panera located on 3rd and townsend in San Francisco, which has a huge selection and great service. I ordered a chipotle Chicken Panini with added avocado to go. They clearly didn't give a f***, my sandwich was only grilled on one Side, chicken wasn't fresh, they threw two pieces of non-ripe avocado in sloppy looking mess of a not at all what I expected from them sandwich. I also ordered a frozen mocha, which was good but would of been better if they manage to make the chocolate syrup in the spacious cup, rather than the rim and outside. As much as I paid, I just expected some quality. Im sticking to a Safeway sandwich and Starbucks coffee, over this location.
Get your s*** together Panera.<//review>

i come here i never have had a problem. all the staff are great.  even the manager megan is a sweet heart,  i think she transfered. but the other manager is just as nice.

the salads a great and the custom make it to whatever you want.  the bear claws are killer when warmed up and with butter.

i come many times to get work done on projects and other things. and the wifi is free.

and they have a rewards program i have recieved free drinks, discounts on meals and stuff.

this place is awesome.< /review>

< review>
The service wasn't good at all. First, I entered this cafe, or restaurant, and I was standing  for at least 3 or 4 minutes trying where I can order. I was so confused and the person who gets the order, saw me and never I asked me I need help. I felt I was ignored. Yah it feels bad trust me and awkward.
Finally, she gave her attention and asked me what I want to order. I ordered caffe, and paid for it then I was told they were gonna call me name when it was ready.
I went to a table waiting to hear my name. I waited for almost 20 minutes and never heard my name. Of course I want to negative where is my caffe I found it on the counter. I had no idea how long I was there! I t wasn't even hot.

I went there to relax and finish some stuff and now I'm pissed off.</review>

<Text>Ordered curbside delivery, but when I arrived, someone who was going into the store pulled into the last curbside spot. So I parked in the lot and marked that I was not in a marked curbside spot on the pickup webpage. A few minutes later, someone comes out with a bag, stands right behind my vehicle, looks around for 5 seconds, and then goes back inside. I tried to call the store 5 times to let them knowI was still here, but they never answered. This was at 1:45 pm, so it wasn't within their "busy" window. What is the point of having curbside pickup if you can't even execute it properly?</Text>< gmapID>
