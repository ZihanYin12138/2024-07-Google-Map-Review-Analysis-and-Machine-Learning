< Review>
I received a call from Vanessa that my teleconference was canceled because they haven’t received an authorization from my provider??? I have a copy of that authorization in my hand that I received 2 weeks ago. It’s IMPOSSIBLE to get through to anyone by phone. Everyone says the doctors are fine but I blame Dr. Hazeltine for NOT taking charge of this horrible office situation. His patients don’t have to go through and this and it’s been on going for years!!! Honestly, I don’t think anyone cares including the doctor’s and PA’s. I will start looking for a new provider.<//Review>

I have been going to Dr. H for about a year now and I am beyond grateful for him. He finally got to the root of my neck pain. He is great and so is his team!<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Unfortunately, I’m a 70 year old with an old Worker’s Comp lifetime claim and I was so grateful that Inland Pain Medicine (IPM) accepted me as a patient.  Worker’s Comp is a nightmare on it’s own.  But (IPM) seems to becoming a much larger nightmare.  I have not had pain in years, until 5 years ago.  Worker’s comp took that long to find (IPM).  I have severe pain from stenosis of my neck as a result of narrowing in my spine from C-3 to C-7.  The pain is now progressively getting worse.  I can’t do anything.  The closest (IPM) office for me to drive is 1 hour with no traffic, one way.  I’ve been to the Beaumont office once.  I’ve never even met Dr. H.  I initially saw Erin, PA, who recommended 350 mg capsules of Gabapentin.  She recommended imaging, PT, and acupuncture.  I got the imaging verifying my condition getting worse.  The only PT they could offer me is, at least 2 hours drive one way for me.  The Gabapentin has not stopped the pain.  I have always mentioned to each of PA’s at (IPM)!that I have needed to also take either Tramadol, Narco, or Valium for the pain.  All of those additional medications, I already had on hand.  Thank God!  My next tele Health was with a man with an accent who did not say much.  My last tele health was yesterday(and I may not have this in exact order) was with Christina.  She asked if the Gabapentin was helping.  I told her it’s not working enough!  She told me to increase my dosage by an additional  1/2 pill.  I guess I should have asked her how you cut a capsule in half.  So, I’ve been taking two 350mg capsules every eight hours.  I’m still in pain to the point of screaming out in pain and crying upsetting my entire household and needing to now turn to street drugs for pain.  Or my family will want to take me to emergency!!  But they can’t because it’s a Worker’s Comp issue.
I’ve tried every imaginable way to try to reach somebody at Inland Pain Medicine, all day.  I’ve called, sent emails, even talked to the chat on line for (IPM).  They are impossible to reach.  It’s Friday afternoon.  I’m in so much pain, I’ve had someone else write this.  Inland Pain Medicine has left a 70 year old with heart failure to cope with immobilizing pain, without a care about it!  This is to worn other people about my painful experience with Inland Pain Medicine!< /review><rate>1<//rate></record>

<Text>Inland Pain has been a godsend! I had been going to Kaiser for months with no relief and was referred by a friend to Inland Pain. They have been AMAZING! My epidural injection has helped my shoulder pain tremendously. The staff and doctors are friendly and helpful. I was very nervous about the injection and everyone made my experience easy and wonderful!< /Text>< pics>

Pain Management is a challenging field of medicine. With Government and CDC “guidelines” that are often in conflict with what would work best for the patient. There are many therapeutic modalities and therapies that can be used, often in conjunction with a wide variety of medications. On my first visit, I learned that IPM has a tightly controlled policy of what they will prescribe and the limits used as guidelines. Because of this, there were no surprises and I had clear expectations going in. Mareena Miller has an excellent ability to evaluate, assess and suggest the best path of treatment. She gives no false promises and sets real expectations for outcomes. Having had 45 surgeries and a MRSA infection in my spine, I needed someone who could give me a realistic idea of what they could accomplish. Mareena did exactly that-and in a caring and compassionate but realistic way. The staff has been professional and this office is very consistent in how things are managed. Years ago, I wanted to hear a 100% cure and being pain free was not only possible, but likely. Experience has taught me that after you break almost every long bone in a harsh and traumatic  way, that outcome is not a realistic possibility. Now, I prefer the simplicity of “here is what we expect to achieve, and we can hope for even better results but this is the most likely outcome of this procedure, surgery, device, etc.
Having experienced both the very best of pain management and possibly the worst, I have found a practice that meets my needs, gives me hope and yet keeps it real. I have never met the owner/operator physician here because the team of Doctors/Nurse Practitioners/Physicians Assistants all seem so competent and understand the philosophy of this practice I am quite content and confident that the level of care here is very excellent and consistent across the board. Mareena Miller is excellent and I will be here for many years to come.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Hesseltine and PAs are fantastic and take the time to listen and come up for solutions for my pain. HOWEVER, the support staff in front who don’t answer nor return phone calls are very apathetic towards patients. I’ve personally had experience and witnessed other patients either with their incompetence or plain uncaring attitudes. They constantly make scheduling errors and blame me for the mistakes. I recommend Inland Pain Center but make sure you get the names of those in the front office when you deal with them. They need a whole new support staff.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcac5ea14a3f49:0x92451c166e2ddcd9<//GmapID><user_name>Stephen Gonzales< /user_name>< response>

<review>I like my Dr but the office staff is rude and I have waited 57 mins to have my phone call answered. When I complain about the long wait, I hear, Oh Sorry. It is completely unacceptable that a pain management office cannot answer the phone within an hour. I feel disrespected and unimportant. Disgraceful!!!<//review>< pics>

I am so thankful that I was referred to Doctor Hesseltine! He is a very kind and compassionate doctor who works very hard to help his patients find relief from their pain! I have had a number of procedures done at Inland Pain Medicine and have never had a bad experience. His treatments have enabled me to walk without pain and has brought me much relief from my back pain! I would highly recommend Dr. Hesseltine and his staff to anyone needing pain management!< /text>

My medication was 3 weeks late due to needing an special authorization that needed their attention...I started calling early AM and by the afternoon still had NOT gotten through...

The staff and Doctor are great and it's nice to have a Doctor who actually listens to what the patient is saying about their own body! I know what's actually going on in my own body, and having someone listen to that and work within that scope of things is refreshing.< /Review>

Very poor experience.... the doctors themselves are fine, but they never come close to seeing you at your scheduled time because they're always very late. They say they will send you a link for a video call, but then change it to an audio call 30 minutes after the appointment was supposed to start.  They accidentally missed one of our appointments and had to reschedule (we found out after waiting in the waiting room for two hours). Its even difficult to get ahold of someone when you call. We set up child care and take off work at a scheduled time and they are unable to keep that schedule, and this happens at every appointment. Like I said, doctors themselves are fine, but they desperately need to hire an office manager. We will never go back.<//text>

I saw Nurse Practitioner Mareena Miller and she was very informative and took the time to listen to my concerns. My primary care doctor would not listen to my pain and wouldn't even listen to me. Mareena ordered x-rays and figured out what is wrong with me. Now I am set up to go to an orthopedic surgeon for my hips and might need surgery. I would have continued to go around in circles if it were not for her taking the time to figure out what's wrong with me. The staff at the Beumont office is very kind and helpful.< /text>

< Review>
I'm so disappointed with my visit. I'm a former patient who had to leave Inland Pain because they stopped accepting IEHP patients back in 2015. Dr. Hesseltine was excellent with me and treated my pain seriously and with TREATMENT, not just meds. For 5 years I had to endure being treated by a different office that only wanted to push pills. When I obtained Medicare, I was told that I could come back and was so happy. Unfortunately, the Nurse Practitioner who saw me was incredibly rude and after grilling me for 10 minutes, procedes to tell me they have a "Zero tolerance policy for patients on Benzodiazapines". So the .05mg I take occasionally due to my disability, disqualifies me from being treated there. My disabilities include chronic pain due to conditions that the judge in my case ruled me 100% disabled.
But that was it. Appointment over, and she says "Just go back to the other Dr. if he's ok with you being on Xanax" as I exited the room. Nowhere on their website is this information explained. I wasn't told this when I made the appointment and why didn't she just come out and say it at the beginning? I feel that after reading my intake questionnaire, she had a negative preconceived idea about me, and as a LEGITIMATE pain management patient, that is our worse nightmare.  We deserve to be treated with respect. If anyone else has been treated like this, you know how devastating it can be. We don't have many options when choosing GOOD pain management providers, and I don't know what happened with this place. I hope others' reading this will be more informed than I was about their policy and save the heartache 💔< /Review>

Well it appeared like a very nice office until your DA came strolling through 45 minutes late wth an office full of patients who were all wearing masks including the staff. She was not of course. As i spoke with her about my various health conditions she informed me that she couldn't give me any pain medicine unless i stopped taking my anxiety medicine clanozapam (0.1mg). She said stop taking it and come back in a month and i could have all the pain meds i want  i tried for 3 days to stop and had 3 horrible days of no sleep and severe anxiety that left me wondering if i even wanted to live anymore. Needing to choose between pain and anxiety would be impossible and i will be requesting my records to send to the medical board for review. You as a pain doctor have no right to have me stop taking a drug subscribed by a Psychiatrists. I have requested a new doctor and asked my primary care doctor to find someone else to refer his patients to before you kill one of them.<//Review>

I think I saw the NP because they didn't introduce themselves to me. The first words out of her mouth were "were going to have to make this short because I have to go pick up my kids". I wasn't offered to rescheduled or come back. I came early sat patiently for like 15-20 minutes and I'm rushed out. In the end I couldn't be helped "try a diet or something". Talked about her life experiences and unrelated health issues in the visit when I thought we were short on time. I've seen NPs or PAs all the time for medical care, so its not that she is an NP, its just that she is unprofessional and rude.<//Review>

<Review>This office is a JOKE! Called to make a new patient appointment and told it would be over a month to get in. Sucks but okay. Make the appointment. Get a call 3 weeks later to be told that they are going to have to cancel my appointment because the doctor won’t be available. (8/7/18) and told the next available wouldn’t be until SEPTEMBER 10th!!! Over a month!!! They want new patients to wait over 7 weeks close to 8 weeks to be seen. They don’t care about their patients!!!

Stay away and ask for a different pain doctor!</Review>< Pictures>

My experience  today was very hurtful I left there the same way as I went in, a lot of  pain. Thumbs up to the office staff and others very professional and friendly. The PAC  he was totally offensive towards me best way  he made me feel. the first thing he said to me was why are you here and I know my doctor has sent the information why I was there.  I showed him how my legs was swollen,  the headaches I've been suffering with.I got the impression  he was treating me like I was someone who's really dfor

Dr. Hesseltine is amazing.  Been under his care for over 10 years.  He takes care of the pain from old injuries that I was told I was just going to have to live with no matter the quality of life.  He had me try different therapies, medications and treatments until we found what works best when the other Drs. had given up after a couple attempts. I'm afraid of needles but he explained the advantages so well that I tried having shots in my back and knees and got back my mobility.   The other Drs. Assistant's I've seen show the same compassion and excellence in care I've come to expect from Dr. Hesseltine.  A few of (training) office staff don't listen well and have tried to give information on things they know nothing about but they get a handle on it pretty quick.< /Text>

<review>I went all the way to Colton for my first visit. I wouldn’t have gone if I knew it was a waste of my time. The physician seemed nice however the pharmacy never received any calls from the office of a gel that is suppose to help my pain and when I try to cal no one answers. I’ve been trying to contact the office for three weeks already and no one ever answered the phone. I am in constant pain everyday and it’s so bad I cannot sleep or function daily without taking Advil so I was hoping this place would help I guess not.< /review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful 5 year experience,  Long time chronic pain patient and theres no cure for me unfortunately but they do truly care. But I must admit not every provider is nice. There was a few PAs I saw within the last year due to scheduling that would have made me want to just "end it" if I was a new patient but thank God for the few good ones that I'm established with.</text>

To the point, doctor Hesseltine is great but he needs to manage his offices more effectively. PAs greatness varies visit to visit, wait time at Colton office is not bad, front and back office staff are nice but behind the scene stuff such as procedure orders and pre-approvals, staff is HORRIFIC and things don’t get sent for approval or get done for months. When you call, average hold time is 30 minutes, so make sure to make your follow up appointment before leaving the office. As far as the practice care is concerned, due to government regulations, opioids are being decreased with no provider active offer on alternative plan or no active follow through on the plan, in my husband’s case stimulator, ablation or even MRI.

In detail, My husband has seen with same pain doctor for years, got large amount of opioids despite my request for other treatments, but got a speech from the doctor instead. Now his opioid med is being decreased to the point of withdrawal with no other active pain management options/plan from pain doctor except the ones I suggested and requested months ago (over a Year) like ablation and stimulator, even MRI; these options have not been followed through by his office until I have asked for a manager on several occasions, in which case, things are only followed through at that moment but dropped the next step. As an example of set backs, we drove 4 hrs for an MRI that was not pre-approved because the authorization staff said 95% of MRIs don’t need pre-approval from the insurance company, but also one of the managers is the one who sent the order to radiology for me to schedule the test; she should have known better when I called to inquire about the MRI delay (about 2 months). Recap, none of those have been done and it has been at least a year for a couple of then; we have practically given up.

Now that you have my facts, you can make an informed decision if you want to pursue your pain management needs at this clinic.</text>

I've had only good experiences with my pain management doctor he addresses all problems that could relate to my pain and care. The staff has been better in the past as far as friendliness but never rude and always does referrals and Rx in a timely manner. Very busy though nothing like the upland office</text>

This doctor is a reference to Doctor Kevorkian!!! Very highly do not recommend this doctor/clinic to anyone if they value their health.</Text><Date>1574191645268< /Date>< Rate>

My experience at Inland Pain Medicine was a blessing.  Dr. Kanu gave me an epidural in my lower back that brought relief that has lasted for many weeks.  Prior to the injection I could barely walk.  Dr. Kanu made my life so much better.  Any time I have talked with employees of this institute over the phone they have been pleasant and helpful.  The Inland Pain Medicine is a wonderful place to be treated for pain, and I truly thank them.< /text>

But I guess they have built up thick skin over the years, because now they are rude and cold to their patients (some of the ones who were in rooms close to mine the 6 months or so that I have been in there, but not rude to me in person (only on the phone)).

I used to feel like I was seen as a person and they understood the physical pain their patients felt when I went in there. Now it feels like I am just another person between them and the money they collect from the insurance company.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

No matter what the dr. Says, they route your prescriptions elsewhere and you do not receive them for a month. The hold time on the phone is ridiculous, and the people are very rude. You have to go down there and physically talk to them to get anything done. If   I could give negative stars I would. Dr. Hesseltine, I would hope that you would hire better staff than this. This is the worst treatment I have received from any Doctors office in a long time. Please consider getting new front desk staff. They ate completely horrible and do not do what the doctor recommends. Very poor business.

<username>Thad T.<//username><Date>1516676757208< /Date><rating>1<//rating><review>ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! If I could provide less than 1 star (...and give negative Stars like another person reviewing below), I would.  I normally never post reviews online, but after being mishandled for more than 5 weeks with this company - and with my Medical file not being properly requested or located ...I felt I had to, or feel I have to say something.  Let me start by saying that I am one of those really laid-back types of people, so it takes a lot to to rattle me or cause me to loose my patience.  So, here is my "WARNING!" to you:  "If you want to be served well, simply STAY AWAY FROM ALL Inland Pain Management Offices".  Unfortunately, it appears they have a disjointed/ uncoordinated system.  Upon my first visit with the Doctor, whom seemed like a nice guy; he expressed his most sincerest apologies for his Office's lack of follow-through & Professionalism - and not having my files ready for my appointment.  I really didn't understand why he spoke as such on the first visit or where all of that tone was coming from; until I tried to assure my records were secured for the next appointment.  As a group of Medical practitioners... their Front Desk Reception, Medical Assistants & Nursing Staff actually seem more like a bunch of "Keystone Cops".  Basically, a bunch of bumbling idiots - and again, it takes alot for you to call names. At IPM, their right hand simply doesn't know what the left is doing.  Their Colton Office seems to be slightly nicer looking, and the hub for the Operation; but they also seem to be just as unorganized.  When, YOU, as their Patient are simply seeking their proper follow-through; they become offended at the slightest of question.  I think they are extra sensitive to concerns or complaints; because they have likely angered many past Patients.  What I am saying is this: "I think Inland Pain Management is one of those types of Facilities only seeking to find a way to ~Bill Your Insurance~ ; but not actually do any work or provide a satisfactory Service."  Primary Care Physicians really should stop & never be referring people in pain to IPM.  SO ...with all of that said, if you don't mind having a "MORE STRESSFUL & PAINFUL" experience when going to a Pain Management Doctor - just disregard all of the "1 Stars" for Inland Pain Medicine and become their Patient.  If you want to stand a fighting chance of getting out of pain, do not make the mistake I made and...: "COMPLETELY STAY AWAY FROM INLAND PAIN MEDICINE!!!!!   That is my absolute best advice to you. *By the way, the positive reviews here or written on yelp - are probably FAKE!  Looks like one of their Staff members wrote them.  MY REVIEW ABOVE IS REALLY WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL ABOUT - Spend your Health Insurance money somewhere else.  RUN! RUN! RUN!... RUN FAR AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!<//review>< Pics>

Customer service is very poor.  Takes forever for them to return a phone call.  On hold for over 20 minutes every time I call.  Physicians treat you poorly also.</Review>

< Review>
Medications are RARELY ordered on time, even though the Dr. said it would  be done!  I've had more trouble here than not, on a monthly basis.  To make things worse, U have to wait on hold for way too long, almost an hour sometimes, just to get through.  And if or when U do, they are very rude & sometimes insulting.  I am filing a formal complaint with times, dates, & names.<//Review>

Good food my kids are crazy about the cold dishes and drinks, nice smiling Customer Service.
I had the Pot Roast and Mash Potatoes and was DELICIOSOS highly recommend it to others to try. The only thing missing for me was a nice piece of bread, but that's me.
Give them a try.</Review>

The sandwich was delicious and the drink made with just the right tangy/sweet mixture! The only minus is the person who made my sandwich did multiply mixed task (even using the cash register without changing his gloves!🤔😱😱 My personal pet peeve..</Text>< Pics>

<text>Healthy fast casual spot, great for lunch. Definitely on the pricier side but food tastes really fresh. Highly recommend their poached salmon and peanut brittle cookie. They also sell massive macarons that have a cake-like texture due to their size. Looking for a drink? Try their signature lemonade.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8saUNyZx2v6NqS2Wf2HifKvWbkXgl612DPGW4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXSn0X3dSx6gcxIZ9Je4T-jI2iRJx6L3r9YTwg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3xx985DJw1E5BWmdp9-3U-yQIhAeKZiPNDROk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Very busy, the food taste pretty good. Time will tell whether they can sustain the quality and the necessary freshness that define the brand name.< /text>

We showed up five minutes before they closed and sat inside while they cleaned up and shut down last night. The employees working during this time did not make me feel uncomfortable or unwelcome though as they did what they needed to. The drinks lemonades and frozen drinks were delicious, as were the salads and tuna tartar. I'd love to return with more time!<//review>

Food looks OK, premises are stylish... however the healthy appearance ends when even eat-in food is served on single-use plastics. No thanks.< /Text>

I’ll make this short. The poke bowls are good. Everything else is kinda blah. The lemonade is great! The foods expensive for the amount you actually get. Staff is nice. Lunch time expect to wait. They do not at this time take Apple Pay.< /review>

Aesthetic and quick restaurant/cafe with a variety of options. Food is very good. A tad pricey.

Lemonade, as expected, is delicious.< /review>

Convenient fast but healthy food.  A bit on the pricey side for the portions you get. New introduction of poke bowls is good but it comes on a boatload of rice.< /text>

<text>Very cozy and nice cafe with many choices of unique food in front of your eyes to pick from. As you walk in front of the counter you can view, ask questions about, and taste what catches your eye before ordering. I particularly like their unique recipes where fruit is interjected into the meal for a different gastronomic experience. It's a good place for kids and adults alike to have a fun and healthy meal together.</text><time>1515959847067< /time>< pictures>

Update:. Music not so annoying... Got used to the ordering process. Less crowded now. Cold dishes are really consistently good.  Rating upped.

Annoying music.  No seating.  Chaotic line and ordering process.  Food is interesting at first.  Salads are good.  Cold appetizer selection is awesome.  Mains are not so great - kinda like cafeteria food.  Ironically, the lemonades are horrible!  - overloaded with sugar.<//Text>

Innovative cold dishes, hot dishes, salads and sandwiches. Something for everyone, served up in a modern cafeteria style presentation. Multiple varieties of lemonade, and tasty desserts as well.< /review>

We only tried the lemonade, and we sat outside, so I can't complain about music or food, as some others have. The lemonades were surprisingly delightful. We tried the cucumber mint, and the pomegranate turmeric. Both were delish and not too sweet. I honestly didn't think I'd like them as much as I did. They also have sugar free options, which I assumed meant they had some other sweetener. WRONG. They aren't sweet. I really like that, since I enjoy sour flavors, and am not the biggest fan of overly sweet drinks. I'll definitely be getting one of those options next time.< /Text>

<text>Food is great and the same as the Palo Alto location that we go to often.  However, the service was so poor and slow that we saw 3 groups of people leave the line before we got to the front.  I’ve never seen something like that before.<//text></record>

It's all just hype not that that good, pay a lot for normal stuff. My wife loved  It though but she is a bit of a hype beast,  So if you're a yezzy wearing Supreme having person like my wife this is a great place for you. that's why i can't give it low rating.< /text>

<Review>During our visit, we found the food to be mediocre and pricey. There were no child-friendly options - we tried the macaroni and cheese, but it was terrible: soggy and smoky and weird. I wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't. (The blood orange lemonade was very nice, however.)< /Review>< Pictures>

We went with a group at about 1205 pm, and two of of us were waiting for the Jammin' Grilled Cheese, and it took over an hour to receive it, and the 2nd one never did come out. How can that happen? We had to get going back to our conference, so I was refunded, but that's ridiculous! Slowest fast casual place I've ever been to.<//Text>

I always like the food, but I feel it's a bit too expensive for what you get (hence the 4 stars). The menu can be a little confusing as well; the structure is similar to a cafeteria but it's difficult to see everything without jumping people in line.

The food, though... the food is quite good!< /Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Updated 8/2017: my conclusion on this place is that it's very expensive for what it is. The food to me, is underseasoned. I paid $50 to feed one adult and two kids. If the food were better, that fact would seem less blatantly obvious to me.

Food is pretty good- some items are very good and others are very average. The flow of the place is awkward and operationally, they are still trying to figure out how to use their teams of staff to get people efficiency through the space. Right now, I'd say they are still trying to find their balance, which is a bit of a surprise as this isn't their first location.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>My neice chose to come here for lunch. I wasnt expecting much but was surprised at how delicious & fresh the food turned out to be. We split a Blt sandwich-which was lightly toasted with crisp bacon. The white truffle mac & cheese was super yummy! They have unique lemonade flavors. This place is nice for a quick bite or light lunch.</text></record></dataset><record>

I love Inland Respite INC!.. My respite person Alonso Jimenez is the most amazing person!.  He cares for my three Children with Autism, and loves his job. My children love Alonso working with them. It's truly amazing seeing him in action, we have being waiting for someone like him (experience with Autism). I'm very pleased with all the care Inland Respite and our caregiver Alonso Jimenez  provides to our Children!.💙💙< /Review>

Lizbett Martinez, in Lake Elsinore, has been a complete joy for our family! Her and my daughter have really bonded. I hope she gets a good review for this. She is so respectful yet fun. Inland Respite has done a great job!< /text>

<Text>Currently work for the office staff in the HR Department. If you are looking for an agency that prioritizes your child, this is the agency for you. We work extremely hard to ensure that the employees match parent requests as well as the client's needs. Unlike many agencies, Inland Respite gives parent's the ability to interview. Giving parent's the opportunity to chose the employee that best suits there needs, will give them that reassurance that their child is safe while they get there well deserved time off. All of our respite employees receive training throughout the year; encouraging continued knowledge of the developmentally disabled community.</Text>< Pics>

<user>113715104124899036014<//user><review>This COMPANY is A fabulous COMPANY to WORK for and to have WORK done by. Our FAMILY has been on both sides of this company, receiving & giving, with great satisfaction & care! MY wife has worked for THE COMPANY for A while now and has been treated with nothing but respect and great professionalism. When we needed to use THE Service ourselves, we received A very honest and hard-working individual who was careful with our request and very caring for our needs. THE OFFICE staff and THE in the field workers have been very professional and have delivered great CARE where needed, when performing their duties. Our family would definitely recommend this company for work or personal service needs. Thank you very much.< /review><date>1475900667142<//date>< Pictures>

<text>I have had excellent service from Inland Respite, Inc.  My current respite provider is a preferred provider whom I have chosen.  However, it means a lot to me how the respite company treats our repite providers with regards to pay, hours, submitting timesheets, etc.  Inland Respite, Inc treats my daughter's provider very well and we appreciate that.  That will keep her (and other quality providers) coming back.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>This place is great, especially as a place of employment.  Ive worked here for over 3.5 years and have been treated great and kindly by the office staff. I honestly have no complaints with the company and will continue working for the company for as long as i can. The clients also are really happy with the service we provide from them. A lot of the clients have told me horror stories they had with other respite companys and had nothing but troubles. Now that they switched to Inland Respite there troubles and problems were met and needs were taken care of. I really hope people make the right choice and either join the company as an employee or even better as a recipient of their services.

<review>I have only had wonderful experiences with this company. It is hard to trust someone with a non-verbal child, but my son was thrilled to work with Martha (his old worker) and Blanca (his current worker).  In all of the hours my son uses (20 a month for three years), I have only had two cancellations.</review>< Pictures>

I have been employed with this company for quite some time, it has allowed me to grow and pursue my Passion within the special needs network.  If you have a passion and desire to help others with special needs this is the company you want to work for.< /Review>

Until I threatened to call IRC, their workers cheat client out of hours and drive time. They do not repermend their workers, one certain got caught and she still works for them.

<text>Horrible!!! The office staff are the rudeist people I have ever met. We interviewed a lady who "seemed" we scheduled 3 days so she could get to know our daughter. She only showed up once. If you don't have to use this company then don't.<//text>< Pics>

Just forfun<//Name>
<text>There’s a white old lady with with glasses.  Big issue!!! She keeps the cool funko pops. I’ve been there a few times and have seen her put away the funkos with more ppg value and hide them.  At the end of the shift she buys them or take them home for her own.  I’ve literally asked her a few times if she was keeping them for her self and she said yes.  No wonder I never find anything good on that store.  Management needs to prevent that.< /text>< date>

<review>Worst gamestop! i went in on 4/24/2021 at 12 when they opened. the lady working had zero game knowledge and swore that these $150 wireless headphones would work on my pc. i get home set up everything and sure enough i  need to buy an adapter for xbox to pc because they are xbox headphones. thought i could trust her but nope. they just hire anyone.< /review><Name>Michael Burton<//Name><Date>1619305778974</Date>< rating>

<Date>1607950207844<//Date><rating>3<//rating><text>I usually don't have issues with Game Stop in Tulare. However I think management should train their employees better. I picked up a game that was pretty-ordered, it came with a necklace. I asked the associate 3x about the necklace, she said it's in the box. The 3rd time she went to ask her manager. The manager said the same. I got home and guess what? No necklace, so I called and the same associate said I just needed to show them my card😒. So next day there I go having to drive another 40 minutes because of their lack of knowledge. Needless to say I was NOT happy to waste my gas.< /text>< Pics>

<text>I only gave it 5 stars because the customer service is great. However the employees knowledge of games, accessories, time and dates of release, etc is extremely lacking. If you're going to hire someone then hire someone who actually has gaming knowledge and can actually answer a question correctly.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Every trip here is a nice visit, its good for people who know what they're doing as well as people who may need help with their game knowledge. I know many people don't know a lot about buying game consoles or anything game related, this is a nice place for them to start<//text>

Very nice place to have an animal healed and released back in to the wild. I had found a red tailed hawk in the acid canal and it was hurt so I called the Shasta wild life there in side the Anderson park area, anyways they cared for it and then after some time they released it back onto the wild (soda speak) so yes I recommend them for sure...5 stars for sure. Thank you Shasta wildlife rescue. J.Beback.<//review>

I brought in a tiny baby bird that had fallen out of its nest and they took him in, fed him formula, put him in an incubator and when he's big enough, he'll go into a wildlife bird cage with other rescued birds. They take all wildlife, just no domestic animals. The staff was kind and helpful. Be sure to make a donation!< /Text>

They can teach you all the basics for getting around on a motorcycle over a short weekend and still continue to make it fun and engaging.

<Text>I had a great experience. There was ample time on the motorcycle for practical experience with overall excellent instruction. However, there were some of the exercises or drills that or a little difficult to understand. What I thought the exercise was and what it actually was,  a couple times were different.  That was especially true for the turn drills.The instructors walked the path, not just demonstrated on the motorcycle,  which brought clarity for me. Our instructors were flexible, responsible, respectful, supportive and able to effectively transmit their enthusiasm as well as knowledge.  I highly recommend this course.  I look forward to taking the intermediate course in the future.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>My experience was great.  All of the instructors where so friendly and most importantly very knowledgeable. It was my first time riding a bike and I was a bit timid the first day of riding, but soon I felt at ease because of the instructors.  When mistakes where made they would pull me to the side and show me what I was doing wrong and how to correct it.  I look forward to taking more courses with Pacific Motorcycle Training in the future.  Thank you to all the instructors for your help and patience.< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate><username>David Perez<//username>< response>

Fun easy program to learn safety riding,by the time I left I was not only knowledgeable in riding but also in motorcycle situations to avoid or how to get around a potential hazard.The instructors were amazing and tony was very helpful and I appreciate him for starting me on my road to be a safe expert rider.< /review>

As a beginner rider with about 6 months of novice experience under my belt, I anticipated not learning a whole lot. I couldn't have been more wrong. The class was absolutely invaluable and anyone who intends to ride motorcycles on or off the street should take at least the introductory/beginner class. Great experience!</review>

It was overall a good class. I've been riding street bikes for 37 years and can honestly say that they were teaching with real world experience.
Mica and Eric? I believe, did a great job and truly seemed to enjoy teaching. George on the other hand, although knowledgeable, seemed like he had never actually taken a class on HOW to teach.
I teach high speed and pursuit driving to veteran officers as well as new hires and photography and evidence collection to CSI's. By far the best class I have taken is one that taught me how to teach.<//review>

Had an excellent trainer, small groups made it possible to practice longer, the only complaint is that I wish they had some lowered Honda Groms for the women, it’s less intimidating with smaller bikes.</Review>

This was such a useful course. I used my scooter as opposed to using one of their bikes. Hole I wish I would’ve had the full experience of learning manual, I still learned a lot from the material of the course itself. I recommend  this Class to people with no experience as well as people with tons of experience. You’ll learn a ton and have a blast doing it.<//Review>

I couldn’t be anymore satisfied I took my course here with Pacific Motorcycle Training. I had zero experience on a bike. I’ve never even got on top of one. I didn’t even know how to tie the bottom of my helmet. My Instructor was probably the best teacher I’ve ever had. He had so much patience and so much clarity that by the end of day 1 I was totally comfortable on a bike. Even during the Zoom class I was able to learn well because of the way they always had us interacting. Thank you for much to everyone at PMT. I can’t wait to come back and take my Intermediate Course!! (Also if my instructor is teaching a class during super bike at Laguna Seca, sign me up!)<//Review>

<review>I had only been a passenger on a motorcycle before I started the beginners course. I can't even drive a manual car. The program was so well designed and executed that I not only passed, but left excited to continue practicing my skills with my new motorcycle license. The instructors, especially Ray, were great at giving helpful feedback and encouragement so that you never feel too discouraged or nervous. I would highly recommend this program to anyone.<//review>< Pictures>

Great school, I was a previous dirtbike rider.  After completing this course my riding skills definitely improved.  I have learned techniques and skills to be a better and safer rider.  Picked up a 2008 Kawasaki ZZR600 and enjoying it and can ride with confidence thanks to the knowledgeable instructors.  Would recommend PMT to any beginner or even experienced riders.<//Review>

<Review>Having never ridden a motorcycle before, I wanted to learn from the best.  After research and talking with others, I selected Pacific Motorcycle Training to get the job done.  They were very knowledgeable and had the students learn each module well before continuing on to the next.  They provided the motorcycles and had several available for us to select from.  The classroom gave us much needed information about being safe on the roadways, types of equipment and apparel to wear for safety and for being visible to other motorists, riding while under the influence and the penalties (both from law enforcement and your physical being) involved, and how to ride during inclement weather and road conditions.  The benefit is that by taking this course you bypass the DMV "riding" part for getting a M1 designation on your drivers license.  You'll still have to take the DMV test (there are two which you can select from) but the dreaded "lollypop" and "weave" part of the "riding" test are avoided completely.

I hugely endorse this class if you're a beginning motorcycle rider and you won't be disappointed.  PMT also offers an Intermediate and Advanced course using your own motorcycle once you've gained some road time and experience.  All in all, a huge WIN for me as the class gave me confidence to ride and the knowledge to help keep me out of trouble.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Name>Ken Morgan< /Name><review>My experience went as follows.  I went in two days before ordering an asked if they deliver shingles roof top.  They said yes for an additional fee (approx $180).  I went in two days later, ordered shingles, ridge cap, etc and asked then to deliver rooftop on Tuesday as the roofers were coming Wednesday.  Tuesday show up and the driver tells me he can't put them on the roof, he can raise his forklift up, but I would have to unload them.  What?  I thought roof top delivery meant to deliver them on my roof.  I called the store and they repeated what the driver said but began to use the term roof edge.  First time I heard that term.  I sent them back (I'm 68 and can't unload 24 squares (72 bundles).  I went back in to the store to get refunded and they would not cover the delivery fee, I"m out close to $200 for doing business with them with nothing to show.  These people, however nice they may be, do not ask the right question, give the right information, nor take any responsibility for what was their mistake.  I will not do business with them again.<//review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Went to pick up a few items, while I was at the checkstand to check out (no one else in line) I was told a needed to wear a mask (looked and there was a sign) I informed the cashier I was leaving and wanted to pay for my items, she then informed me I HAD TO BUY A MASK before I could purchase items! She was then preoccupied about everyone else coming in without a mask that she had to rescan my items several times! She needs to work on her customer service! She could have easily informed, new store policy next time you cannot enter without a mask, I was already walking around the store for 30 minutes, what is the point of forcing me to buy a mask when I'm leaving!!!! So long HD Supply-taking my business elsewhere!<//Review>

However, I have found materials/parts the other stores dont cary, for comparable prices and even some lower prices.

First time I needed something from the yard, no one offered to help, but second time in i asked if i could get a hand and they did the loading for me. I think their style is to just leave you alone unless you ask for help.</text>< user_id>

definitely a 0 star. i had a scheduled appointment that they needed to reschedule due to short staff. that's fine. so i rescheduled for a day they assured me a simple oil change would take less than an hour. flash forward 1.5 hours later, they still haven't even gotten to my car! then they tell me they can take me next. i had an appointment and they prioritized walk-ins. very irritated. not coming back.</text>

<review>When I first called I spoke to Sherri to get a quote, she was really kind and knew what I was looking for and understood the issues I was experiencing. Later on, while waiting for the repair and tires I spoke with Robert about other tires and cars I've had, again he was really kind and really knowledgeable about vehicles in general. They both went above and beyond to answer any questions I had about my account and more questions about my brakes or other services and concerns they saw with the car. I'd also like to add that Lopaka stayed and finished the job with my car way past his time to leave and took the time to finish the job, again above and beyond my expectations! I spoke with other customers that had also taken their cars here and heard the same that they also come back because of the work and trust of this team to get the job done right. In a couple of hours while waiting I observed their experience and knowledge was consistent with wanting to help others,  I saw one customer who was rude to Robert, he had a cool attitude toward him and gave an understanding of service levels and expectations of the wait times for the service he wanted and scheduled an appointment.<//review>< Pictures>

If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. I recommended this place to to my son. He took his 2007 Silverado pick up there for an oil change. Seems simple enough right!! We dropped it off a couple hours later we get a call. They said he needed a new oil pan. Well the strange thing was he had the oil changed a few weeks ago with no problem at the Antioch Firestone. So we called back and talked to the manager Sherry. She agreed that the tech must have stripped the oil drain plug and said she would fix it for free. we picked it up brought it home in the next day it was pouring oil all over the driveway in the undercarriage of his truck. I mean it was gushing out!! This time we took it to our personal repair shop. They said it needed a new oil pan because they stripped the threads on the oil drain pan, trying to repair it. We took it back to Sherry with the documents from our shop. she took responsibility and said she was going to repair it. We dropped it off again. Two hours later Sherry calls. Now she says the rear main seal is leaking, even through we have pictures of it gushing out the oil pan. So we take it back to our repair shop and have them strip it down and look at it again, just to make sure something was not missed. Our shop once again says it’s 100% their fault and we have tons of pictures to prove it. now I have a $900 oil pan bill a driveway full of oil spots android an undercarriage covered in fresh oil. Do not go here unless you enjoy paying but loads of repair bills</text>

<Date>1601411065806< /Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Poor customer service. This location had me drive to another Firestone in a different town to purchase two car batteries I needed. I was told I could bring my old battery cores to this location with my receipt to receive a $20 refund for each core. After lugging them into the store and waiting in line, manager Sheri told the cashier to tell me that the other Firestone made a big mistake in telling me I could return the cores to this location and wouldn't honor the refund. They said if I wanted that refund I need to take them back to the Firestone in the the other town. I asked to talk to the manager Sheri but was told she was busy in a meeting. Won't be giving them my business again.< /text>< Pics>

The service advisors are great and the mechanics know what they are doing. I usually do my own maintenance on my cars. I bring them here when I don't have the equipment (alignment or tires) or cant figure out what is going on. They are always helpful. If you make an appointment for normal stuff, it's pretty quick. You can't make appointments for diagnostics or brakes, so make sure you go early to get into the work bay faster...< /review>

<review>Replaced tires six months ago for $700. picked up nail.
Going to charge me to repair nail hole because I did not buy their rip off hazard insurance.

Would give zero stars if possible.

Follow up two days later: wrote Firestone with a complaint. They responded with a bunch of corporate baloney and wanted to know invoice number etc etc. They have all this data in their database as was demonstrated at the store. That's it...done with Firestone.

Meanwhile went to Brentwood Tire and got the job done in 10 minutes. Told him about my experience and he said "what they won't do for you, I will" wouldn't charge me a nickle for the repair. So the owner atr Brentwood tire, with one simple gesture, won my family's business form this point forward. Good riddance to Firestone.< /review>< resp>

<Text>I'm sure the oil change and tire rotation went well, but the lobby of this place was filthy. Floor looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks and the two lone armchairs had large patches grime. And to top things off, Firestone has eliminated WiFi. Appearances speak volumes and this store's presentation is woeful.</Text>< pics>

Went in to make an appointment to install two tires and wheel alignment.  Sherrie, store manager, got me in right away. 1 hour later I was driving down the road. They also did a complete vehicle check (free) while I was there.  I definitely will be back.  Thank you Sherrie and your staff.</Review>

If can do 0 stars would. Avoid this place at all cost. Customer service the worst I’ve ever experienced. Took 2 hours to start car after appointment time and then left car on lift for 2 hours to go work on another “appointment” completely disregarding my car.<//Text>

Went in to drop MY MOTHER'S VEHICLE off with HER OWN FIRESTONE credit card to pay for the services (brakes) and I was told that they would not accept HER FIRESTONE CREDIT CARD, TO PAY FOR HER CAR,  from me because of OTHER FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS!!!!!!????????????????????????
(not to mention SHE'S been a customer for years...rountine checks..HAS A WHOLE  ACCOUNT IN THEIR SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING) AND AFTER TRYING TO SUGGEST MULTIPLE WAYS OF VERIFYING HER IDENTITY (faxing in her Drivers License) IN ADDITION TO HER ACTUALLY CALLING IN AND TALKING TO BOTH LADIES THERE SHERI AND VERONICA she was still told that they could not take HER FIRESTONE CREDIT CARD from me...SERIOUSLY...TALK ABOUT LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE...

<Text>So a few years back I bought an Interstate battery here. I bought an Interstate battery for the quality and warranty.
Fast forward to now, there is a crack in the top of the battery which is causing the acid to leak and destroy the positive terminal.

I called here beforehand to verify my warranty. The girl on the phone said no problem bring it in for pro-rated coverage. Awesome.

When I get there the lady behind the counter accuses me of hammering on the batery or that my alternator is over charging. I explain that is not the case. The vehicle it came from is well maintained and driven back and forth to work.

I don't appreciate being accused of mistreating the battery. That is the last thing I would do to a $160 battery🙄 The lady was very condescending. The only reason they get two stars is that she honoured the warranty.</Text><rating>2<//rating>< pics>

Do not got to this place. They add extra labor and parts to jobs to just get extra money. Brought in own tires to get replaced and want to charge me money for new air pressure sensor that are not failed on my car and used excuse  as they might fail after we just change your tires. Talk to customers like we are stupid and gullible.</review>

Went in to check my tire censors.
They said the only sensor that wasn’t working was the front left one. The cost to replace it would be $122
I called Les Schwab (0.3 miles away from this Firestone, on Lone Tree Blvd) and they tested all of the sensors for free. Turns out only sensor that WAS working was the front left one (only intermittently).
I checked the diagnostic and the mechanic at Les Schwab showed me as he scanned each sensor- sure enough! Only semi-functioning sensor was the one Firestone said didn’t work!

Firestone tried to charge me about $250 more than Les Schwab to replace 4 sensors.

BUT they do have a daily deal at Firestone!
For every service provided, you'll pay top dollar & they’ll throw in their industry-best poor customer service!< /Text>

Don’t take your car for oil change there!   I had several issues since I went there and found oil in my driveway.  1st time they forgot to tighten down the plug causing a drip in my driveway and second time they screwed around with my oil filter adapter by prying and damaging it causing it to leak.  I had to trouble shoot myself since they screwed it up on purpose trying to create work for their shop.  See they don’t make much on oil changes so they always try to bring up issues to get business.   I don’t try to bash anyone business but they caused me a lot of headache trying to figure out why all of a sudden is my car leaking oil in my driveway after I took it there.  It took me a while to figure out where the leak is coming from but i figured it out.  Absolutely untrusted and will never go back.< /review>

We've been doing business with Firestone for 50+ years. They're our go-to place for auto repair when the vehicles are out of warranty. They've always treated us fairly. We have lifetime alignment on our vehicles so we're here every six months maintaining the vehicles.<//Review>

Firestone offers lifetime alignment and wheel balancing/rotating, which would be great... If I could ever get a decent turnaround time from this place. Every time I go in they ask me if I can keep my car there for up to six hours! It takes 20 minutes to to balance wheels and less than that to rotate tires. The Firestone next to the Concord mall was able to offer me a decent turnaround time no problem, why is it so hard for this store to offer the same? I realize it gets busy but come on, I shouldn't have to wait half a day for something as simple as a tire rotation. If I didn't already pay for a lifetime wheel balance/rotation plan then I would take my business to America's Tire instead.</text>

If I could just rate this place  for a half Star I would! First time here and definitely my last! Made 11 am  appt  just to change my tires and it took them almost 3 hrs to get it done. 3 hrs just yo change the tires. Too far from what the  lady told  me that it’ll be done for an hour or so coz I have appt. If I didn’t tell them I got some appt to go I’m probably wasting more time of life there for another couple of hours. Unbelievable. Poor time quality and poor management.<//text>

So I took my 72 nova in for a alignment, when I got it back it was pulling bad to the right I called and scheduled a new opt when I showed up the employee Erika said the tech who was going to do the work would be out to my car wait for him there 15 minutes later i start walking to the building and out walks a tech from the bay and yells can I help you? Before I could answer he’s walking to my car so I said “ok you must be the one working on it then “we get to the car and I open the door and start to show him how to turn the ignition on and how to shift as a lot of people have trouble shifting my car he asks my to demonstrate and I said I am then he yells “we’ll do it !” rudely. I got out of my car and started walking back in the building he then throws the clip board at me and tells me to “take my hot rod somewhere else” . I go inside and explain what I just experienced with there tech Zong. Erika tells me it’s not there job to be nice to people it’s ours” (the people working up front). I asked for a refund and she gave it to me.As I walked back to my car Zong was in the bay making baby crying sounds.Im a 41 year old male with a family.He looked 45 or so...........WOW</Review>

Their customer service was great. Manager Robert was straight forward and honest.

I absolutely would NOT recommend this Firestone location. I pulled up to get an oil change, and I see two mechanics chilling out and relaxing in the garage. So I asked one of them how long it would be for an oil change, he tells me 6pm because they were supposedly "real busy." (it was 2:45pm). This young man didn't offer to schedule and appointment, or fit me in. And I couldn't understand how he could tell me that they're so busy, when I could clearly see that him and the other young man were busy doing a whole bunch of nothing. Very lax and nonchalant attitude. Not a good customer experience, and they CLEARLY don't want to make any money.</review>

They try to up sell you things you don't need by offering  discount tire rotation wrapped into a 40 minute copleat inspection.
If you just want the tire rotation they charge twice the amount for the rotation!
This will most likely be my last visit here.....can you say RIP OFF!< /Review>

I had an appointment for 3pm on Wednesday June 14th 2017. I dropped off my company fleet vehicle for a 30k mile service. They said it would take a few hours. I never received a call, and they close at 6pm. They locked my car in their bay overnight, and when I finally got ahold of someone the next morning, I found out no service was done to my car. I received a call 20 min later, informing me my vehicle was done. I pick up my vehicle and park it. Today, I go out to my vehicle and have a completely flat rear tire. I call and immediately they get defensive and tell my they only rotated the tires (which is not completely true, as the psi on all 4 of my tires was different, which means they at least added air) and I must have picked something up on my drove home. Now I am here a third day in a row for basically an oil change. As a 24hr on call employee, this is just unacceptable. I was already told by my company to not bring my vehicle here again, but with the service I received here the last couple of days, I will not be bringing any of my personal vehicles here anymore. Which is unfortunate as there are not many places near me that provide a one stop shop for maintenance.

Edit: They just finished "fixing" my tire. Apparently the tire was leaking from its bead. They are charging fleet for a flat repair, even though I drove 28,500 miles with no issue on this tire, but the 3.5 miles I drove home from this place caused the issue. This place is a joke.< /Text>

I came to this Firestone in January because I had a really bad puncture in my passenger front wheel. I ordered a set of Potenza S-04s from Sherrie (I think she's the manager there?) and she was pretty friendly to me at the time. I waited about an hour and a half for the service to be completed. On July 4th on my way back from work, I saw my tire pressure light had turned itself on. Once I got home and checked the pressure, it was down about 9 psi, so I just refilled it and assumed nothing of it. The morning of the following day, the tire was completely flat. I refilled it and sprayed soap/water around the tire assuming there was a puncture. The leak seemed to be coming from the valve stem. (I've only owned the tires for 5 months at this time). I went back to Firestone the same morning and discussed my problem with a guy named Dominic (really nice guy, I recommend you seek him out if he's working). After he came back from checking the tire with me, he was kind enough to vouch that tire itself didn't look like it was damaged. Sherrie was stern and stated, despite my disagreement and the fact she didn't personally check, it was deemed to be road hazard related (no real signs that it was nicked, scrapped, etc). I decided to pay the fee to replace the value and move on. Well, last night ANOTHER valve stem started leaking on the rear passenger tire (seriously?) I HIGHLY doubt this was road hazard related and it made me very mad about the first one (I guess the driver front and rear are bound to fail sooner or later). I went down to Les Schwab's and they didn't even charge me to replace the stem.... despite the fact I didn't even take my car there to get the tires worked on!! The wait time was relatively the same. What was the bonus of me visiting the competition? The tech who worked on my car asked if I was pulling my tire stem because there wasn't any signs that something hit the stem (maybe my cat has been pulling my stems when he's mad?)

Edit 2: I'm going to leave the majority of the original post because it's important to show my clarification. I went into Firestone again because the same tire (front passenger) that was worked on started leaking again. Sherrie was at the front desk and I told her of the situation. I decided to be more constructive by mentioning the tech who'd happen to work on my car the two times I've had this issue (his name won't be posted for privacy and potential harassment). She promptly tackled my problem and even apologized that I was charged for the last valve stem (honestly, I could have mis-remembered about mentioning it was the valve stem particularly last time because I can get flustered having to deal with these issues before work). She also refunded me the last charge from Dominic which she didn't have to do, but she felt personally inclined to make things right. When all is said and done, Firestone is a pretty awesome place when you're objective and cool-headed because Sherrie did take the time to hear me out when most corporations/chains simply don't and generally enforce policy. You might wanna catch her early in the morning though because after 9, I notice customers start coming in droves (I was there at 8 this morning I was still behind 3 people. Les Schwab's isn't different in that regard). When you're under that much pressure and a customer is being rude (like I most likely was before work that day) it's hard to be nice regardless of the situation. (I've done bookkeeping for an auto garage in the older part of Antioch and their customer's gave me headaches despite the fact I never had to deal with them).

When Firestone replaced the valve stem this time, they did see that the tech working on the tires wasn't properly installing it (maybe he didn't have experience on my particular model's rim size) and I'm sure he'll be taught so he doesn't repeat the problem! :D

I did remove an after-note I placed as well because it was rude and I shouldn't have done it. I also changed the second sentence because I bought a set, not two. A couple of grammatical fixes were made as well.</Review>

<text>6/26/16- Disappointed!! Went in today b4 9, which it was not open yet. The store rep stopped me to tell me today we are taking appointments only. No walk-ins because that are overbooked from Saturday's work. WOW!!!  Overbooked = bad managing. SMH. So I ended up going across the street Tri City Xpress Lube and I got my oil changed done in 20 mins.

Old review- Great service. Been going there for 8 years.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808ff8b6208aabf3:0xb9ca83a1248573ed< /gmap_id></record>

They are too expensive. Surprisingly, the dealership can be less expensive for routine things such as an oil change<//review>

It's a typical firestone. Be ready to set through the BS. Oh and get changed way to much. I normal only go here for the lifetime alignment. But make sure they show you the before specs before they start the work. The van fake the results if they don't show you first.< /review>

I ordered a Chuck Strawberry bowl with extra granola on the side and paid for it. I got it in a large cup instead, watery, with less granola (to my knowledge I paid for the extra amount, so I assume they gave me less for that reason) and too much banana. If I was informed ahead of time that they were going do this I would have not ordered it and gone to a different one. This jamba juice used to be my go to but honestly its been a couple times where the smooties and the bowls just come out uninspiring. Thank you for your service but I will no longer come here.</Text>

I have come into this establishment over a dozen times now, I live near this plaza so I tend to stop by for my Jamba "fix", While I completely believe its plausible that someone did not have a great experience, I have never had my order wrong, it has always tasted great and it has never taken such a long time that I really noticed. So for me < - - it is a 5 star.

As a side note - Take these reviews with a grain of salt, if you look at a lot of the bad post like the guy under mine, you will notice they spend a lot of time just posting bad reviews on almost everything, some people are just overly critical and will not hesitate to exaggerate 1 visit.<//Text>

This place has always been empty when I go get a smoothie. I've been to other jamba juice where they give you the extra juice that's left over in a small kids cup FREE, that  most of the time doesn't even get full half way in the kids cup. The guy doing the smoothie told me they aren't allowed to do that, that they usually charge $.75 cents. This is the 1st I hear about this since I've always ask to get what's left over. I mean I have paid for the smoothie in a large etc. That dude was straight tripping. Not going back there again! The smoothie was so sour I did not enjoyed it one bit. Yuck!< /review>

I come here once in a while. the service is ok most of the time. but as a customer would appreciate if the employees kept their relationships away from work. a non-employee hanging out behind the desk just to argue, cry, and walk away is very unproffesional of the EMPLOYED to allow. just saying< /text>

Was just a huge waste of my time and gas money and I didn't get any results. I've had multiple other COVID tests but I needed the $75 rapid test for an upcoming event so I drove two hours to take this test since there's none closer. I got there at the my appointment time. Waited in car line for 20 minutes (not bad). Got the nasal swab and was promised results within 30 minutes (great). I start driving back home. One HOUR later they call me to say my sample was contaminated and could I "swing by" to provide another sample before they close.  If they called me within 30 minutes as they promised, i could have made it back before they closed.</Text>

<Text>I went here to get my rapid test because of an exposure. I paid $99 for the 30-minute test but the result did not come until 2 hours later. The only
Phone number provided was the corporate number but when I called the corporate number, they could not provide the status of my test or when I should expect to get my test result except “oh, it can take more than 30 minutes to get the result.” The customer service was really bad. If you need to get a quick result, go somewhere else .< /Text>< user>

<text>Hello, I don’t know English, so I wrote some questions with translation software.  If I want to do a nucleic acid test, is it free?  Do I need to make an appointment?  I have received two Pfizer vaccine injections, and I always wear a mask, but I have been experiencing intermittent coughing, lethargy and other symptoms in the past few days.  Is it possible to be infected with the new coronavirus?< /text><name>Roronoa Zoro< /name></record></dataset><record>

Pretty easy to navigate process. They have a 1-800 number you can call with questions. Once there, the wait was short and the process quick. Rapid results received quickly.  Fast service when I later requested they forward results to another party. Would use them again, if needed!<//Text>

<Review>Waited in line 2 hours with an appointment!
Very inefficient!
They have one line for appointments and drive through no appointments!
I had this done in a different country and it took 10 minutes, night and day.
When I was finally tested they did not ask to see an ID! This should be reported to higher authorities, especially  as this was for an international flight.
The results arrived only 1 hour before boarding!
This company should be barred from COVID testing of flights in all airports!
Shame on you COViD clinic SFO!

I am reporting this to airport authorities too.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>We made an appointment 4 days ago and waited for ONE HOUR to be tested even though we were on time. There was only ONE employee working so she had to do everything by herself. That poor girl! We tried to call the phone number listed on the side of the truck to let them know she needed help - the system was not working properly. Previous to our visit, my husband had been sent a link to leave a review. When he tapped on the link it sent him to a blank page which had no server available. Now I have a text stating I tested negative and no document to present when I travel tomorrow. I pray they get my email and respond quickly. That was a lot of money for a total disaster. (Kudos to the girl who was left on her own and kept it together! What a trooper)</Review>< gmapID>

<Text>I have been to the Covid Clinic one time, and that was in September of 2020 because I had an exposure to someone who had covid. The people who worked there the night I was tested couldn't have been better.  That experience was 5-star. You may be asking why is this a 2-star rating? In May of 2021, I received a text from Covid Clinic saying I had a positive covid test. Over the next couple of days, I received phone calls from OC Healthcare Agency asking how I was feeling, with whom had I had contact recently, etc. The thing was, I was not ill, and I had not had a Covid test in May. It took a number of phone calls to OCHCA to convince them I was not the person with the positive test. I called Covid Clinic to inform them that their records were wrong, and need to be corrected. I never received a call back. I called a number of times, but never was able to resolve the issue. Did you know that Covid testing sites get government money when there is a positive test? It is August of 2021 and I just received results from the Covid Clinic for a covid test that was not mine.  The result was negative, so at least Covid Clinic is not receiving government money for a positive test. I'm not sure if I care enough at this point to waste my time calling them to change their record because I don't expect them to take any effort to update my record since they didn't before.< /Text>< date>

Smooth and simple. Clear guidance by the staff.

In my case there was a little confusion with regards to the speed (1 day results) of delivery of the results vs which location I was supposed to go to for the same.

The error was identified at the test site staff themselves and the staff quickly coordinated to have to results delivered within the time frame and also planned a work around in case of delay so that I did not have to go back to repeast the test.
Congratulations to one an all. Keep up the good work.</review>

So fast, easy, and painless! I'm traveling for the first time since before the pandemic and I wanted to get a test to ease some of my worries. I was able to make an appointment same day and it couldn't have been an easier experience. The peace of mind was 100% worth the money! I'll be back for sure.<//text>

<Text>We were diverted to the Palm Springs  location for our tests after the facility’s regular hours. Anthony, the technician had just closed up and was driving away. He circled back to see how he could help. With the support of his Manager Vanessa, he re opened the facility and conducted our tests. He was helpful, polite and efficient. Vanessa was extremely customer centric and helpful. Thank you both for your professionalism as we would have been in a real bind without our tests to cross the Canadian border.  Great service!<//Text>< pictures>

I was very pleased with the application and testing process.  I took both the rapid and 2-day Covid tests. My rapid test was returned in about 20 minutes!   It was a relief to confirm my Covid status and contact my doctor for more information.  Thanks< /review>

Park your car and walk to the trailer and beat everyone waiting in the car. The workers clearly don’t care.

My appointment was at 12:15pm, I’ve been waiting here in my car since 11:50. There are people walking up and cutting the lines and have already been helped. I asked them on their way out when their appointment was and they said 12:45. I tried to get out to wait with those who walked up, but they told me to go back in my car. I don’t think it’s fair they aren’t helping people in order. It’s now 1:18pm and I’m still in line.</Text>

<Text>Although there is a long wait time, it is completely understandable with the amount of people trying to get tested vs. number of employees. Give them some slack they’re human as well, it’s hot, they’re outside and their job is not easy especially dealing with everyone’s personalities, impatience and rudeness. On a positive note, they were extremely nice and gentle and quick.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

There was only one car in line at 11:30am when I arrived (clinic lunchtime varies). The male clinic technician was cordial, informative and administered the test with gentleness. Shortly after taking the covid test, I received a followup call from a doctor. She was very informative and was able to answer all of my questions and then some! Tested NEGATIVE, Yeah!</Text>

<text>CovidClinic has a disorganized, slow process. You will wait over an hour or even two, there will be 20 or more cars in line. You will NOT get a test result within 30 minutes if it is a "rapid Antigen test."  It will take an hour or more. They have a great Google ad that guides all the traffic to them. Test sites are filled up in San Francisco, so we opted to pay, knowing full well that there would be issues.  If you are going to charge people money, snap it up. That's why we pay money. For you to snap it up. Testing sites at other places deliver what they say.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Thank you so much to the young lady who administered the test to me at 0900 this morning. I was already stressed out because I was exposed to an individual that tested positive to Covid, so having to find a place to test and get results immediately through my anxiety into overdrive.

Very professional, knowledgeable, personable, and caring staff. I and the whole family were pleasantly surprised! Also, the process was quick and the results were forwarded within 20 mins, for our antigen tests, and within 12hrs for our PCR tests.
Was able to use the provided emailed certificates without a hitch at the Frankfurt and Athens airports. So, very effective and efficient and top service by the team (a young lady supervising and the two young men administering the tests). I wish had taken their names to give them proper credit!</Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE FOR A TIME SENSITIVE TEST. We had to wait 30 min after appointment time to get tested and were told results would be available within an hour. Now going on hour 5 with no results and none of their contact methods work and even their website is down. They clearly can't handle the volume of tests they are accepting. If you need your test results within the promised timeframe, do not come here.</Review>< pictures>

This clinic saved my bacon.  I got a 30 minute antigen test about 2+ hours before a flight. The personnel there were friendly and helpful without question. They helped me fill in the long series of forms needed prior to testing.  I needed those results back in 30 minutes without fail so I could check in, and they were just a bit late.  I called at about the 35 minute mark to inquire, and I got an email with the results about 5 minutes after I called.  So, I did get them in time for my needs.  All in all - they came through for me. A little late, but not so much to cause a problem.  I would recommend.</text>

I was very pleased with my experience! I had some reservations as the last drive up covid testing place I went to I had a bad experience. This trip was for my 4 year old. I was greeted right away. The guy was so nice and walked me through all the registration preprocess online. The guy who did my kids test was so nice and I got results with no issues in the time frame I was told. I seriously have no complaints about my experience. Will definitely use them again if need.<//Text>

We had a great experience at Covid Clinic! I accidentally made the appointment for the wrong day, but I looked on the website and they said to show up anyway, and sure enough they tested my son right away. We got the results (rapid antigen test) before we even reached home.</text>

What a disappointment! My wife and I had an appointment for 1:30 pm at the facility behind the Marriot near the Burbank airport and got to the facility 15 minutes early but ended up waiting 1.5 hours in line. They seemed extremely disorganized, coming back to re-take info repeatedly, what a mess, I would NOT return to this testing facility.</Review>

<review>I got a One Hour Rapid PCR test here this morning.  The check-in and testing were fast, easy and professional.  The staff were friendly and  helpful.  And my RT-PCR test results came back in just under an hour, as promised!

The lab is in a former parking lot off Terminal Ct.  The parking lot also hosts an Amazon Prime delivery hub, so if you see an entrance with lots of Amazon Prime vans going in and out, you are at the right place.  Drive in, go past the herds of Amazon vans, and you will see the two orange-and-white Covid Clinic vans in the middle of the lot.<//review>< pics>

Got the one hour test at Palm Springs airport.
Mine came back in 40 minutes. The tech mixed up my wife’s and we didn’t get her results. The tester, Chris scrambled and made a huge effort to get it corrected and got us the result just as we checked in. His extra effort saved the day.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Never pay $399 for their one-hour COVID test. People who need this test usually have some emergency or unplanned trips. They will take advantage of your situation and will promise and assure you that the test will be delivered on time so you could catch your flight. After you pay you will spend your time calling them to find out the results of your test. The results will arrive after several hours (9 hours for me) when most likely you either missed your flight or do not need the results any more. They will reimburse you $80 and will tell you that the test was not warranted to be delivered within one hour. At the end one-hour COVID test would cost you more than $300 plus emotional distress and the feeling of being cheated. There are many reliable COVID labs and you should not waste your time and money with Covid Clinic.< /review>< pics>

The person who did the test was super friendly and helpful. Got my results before I was home! Finding the place was terrible. GoogleGPS led us to an entrance of a huge mall. Finally found a phone number to call but it was a useless robot. Drove around the mall repeatedly, called again and actual helpful human gave us correct directions. The confirmation email  should have included  detailed directions. Googlegps is unreliable in the portland area and deserves some of the blame here too. Wish I could give a 5 star rating cause I know the ppl at the facility have no control over the cumbersome website or poor directions but will nevertheless be dinged for the low ratings.<//Text>

<Text>We were traveling to Canada and needed to have a negative PCR test completed within 72 hours of us crossing the border.  We purchased the test online and scheduled an appointment a couple of days in advance.  When we showed up for the test, the person checking us in was disorganized and took a long time to get us going.  The person who actually performed the test was very professional an expedient.

We got our tests within 48 hours via email which was great, we checked and were all negative - so far so good.   When we showed up at the border, the Canada health officials inspected our document and noted that the date on the document that states when the test was taken WAS THE DAY WE ORDERED THE TEST not the day we actually took the test, putting it out of the 72 hour requirement.

We were held for an hour while we dug up our appointment confirmation emails and the border people took pictures of them and tried to call Covid Clinic to confirm the correct details (called 3 times, got no answers).  They finally let us through because we could show the appointment confirmations.   We paid $150 for each test specifically to get the date right with the test results - this was a huge and costly fail.< /Text>< Name>

DO NOT count on them for the 1 day turn around time.

Used the clinic specifically for the 1 day results due to flight requirements. My daughters results did not come in until the 2nd day, which forced me to pay an additional $400 for the 1 hr test.

The reps were no help; “sorry you just need to wait” was the main answer. After promises of a follow up as soon as they heard back from the lab regarding the delay, there was nothing.< /review>

Unreliable service and distasteful experience. Took the 1-2 day RT-PCR test. Mailed customer care as the results did not arrive after 48 hrs, they promised that the result would arrive by the end of day 2 which did not happen. No service in the night. Spoke to another agent the next day who said my report was missing and promised a full refund. which wasn't issued too. Had to speak to 3 more agents to have them look into the issue and finally send my results after 2 more days and a half refund. No concern for customer time and agony.<//review>

do not do the 1 - 2 day result PCR test. it does not come on time. you'll miss your flight. Best thing to do never go this place. you will regret it. you can't track your test, they hang up the phones, it's expensive and slow, very unreliable...

and look at this refund policy... they say 2 day results then give customer his refund if it passes 3 days...<//review>

Terrible! Run away!! In covid times there are loads of opportunists trying to ride the profit waves.

Covid Clinic has a great location near to the airport, but don't get yourself fooled, not good professionals. I had my RT-PCR done with them... They state 1-2 days results. That will make you think possibly one day, maximum 48 hours, right?

No, not the case. I'm on day 5 and no results, no active communication, so far no refund, I missed my flight, reschedule cost me nearly $500... So yeah... Go find something better and save yourself the stress.<//text>

DO NOT ORDER EARLY MORNING TESTING AT THIS SITE!!!!  The website said 24/7 testing and I signed up for a 4:30am test for a 7 am flight.  I showed up along with several other cars who had booked early morning tests to a lone security guard, and no staff.  I had to rebook a whole flight itinerary.  When I finally came back during the day I got my test with a quick turnaround time, but no apologies or concerns for my lost time.  If you have time, get tested elsewhere.<//Text>

Very long wait time ( 1 hour ), despite having an appointment and just a few cars in the line. Half way through swabbing my own nose, I was told i am not doing it correctly and was accused of not listening. I asked if the test administrator could assist but they are not allowed to do so. Extremely poor management.</review>

I had an appointment thru Trustassure recommended by United and they are only brokers ....I did not know that. No information, no follow up or follow through. No way to talk to anyone and you leave messages and emails with no response. So I scrambled to get my test done 2 hours before my flight with COVID clinic and they had my results in under an hour. Thank you, don’t know what I would have done !!!!!< /review>

Not thrilled, had to drive to the clinic again to complain not getting the result. They offered me to do another test for 399 out of my pocket since the insurance wouldn’t cover tests for convenience (travel). After they did some more checks, I got a text that the result was negative but still didn’t get the report I need for traveling... not amused...
Eventually the result finally came in...</Review>

DON'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE. I purchased an expedited RT-PCR test for travel. Results are supposed to be available within 1-2 days. My plane departs in a few hours and I have not received the test results. No one answers their telephone numbers; you reach a recording, and it hangs up in ~2 minutes. THIS IS TERRIBLE SERVICE, IF IT CAN EVEN BE CALLED THAT.<//Text>

Definitely recommend it, if you need it ASAP! It was easy to buy test online (I choose Repid Covid + FLU), then just drive-in the same day (any location) to be tested. The car-line was not too long, only 3 before me. You just need to show your barcode , that's it. They will take a nose swab (not painful at all). Very fast - I got my results while was driving home (30 min). Thank you guys 🙏</text>

The RV that does the testing is about 5mins from SFO. You need to drive there. It is under-staffed and super inefficient. They do nasal swab (not mouth). The result comes via email, and if you have a typo in your email (like I did), it is impossible to correct. After 6 phone calls and an hour, no one can fix it, and the calls keep dropping, which they have acknowledged is an issue on their side with their VOIP. What a mess.< /Review>

Don’t go here, very usage. I paid for a rapid antigen test and PCR test as I had come into close contact with someone who tested positive. My rapid antigen results came back straight away as negative but I wanted to isolate until I got the PCR results. It’s almost a week later and I still have not received these results. Luckily I went to a kaiser facility to get a second PCR test which came back as positive so if I had taken the covid Clinic antigen test results as bible I would be at work today infecting everyone I work with. This place is a joke, please don’t go here for your own safety.<//review>

<review>I set up an appointment and paid $400 when I got to the site there was nobody there. Went back to my phone list and had just received a cancelation from the clinic. Tried to follow the links to reschedule the appointment and could not get to the right location scheduler.   The only thing I could find out was that if I showed up the next day they would give me the test but there was no guarantee This should not happen for you to have to pay this amount of money for an essential test and then be stood up and not given guarantee for service.</review><Pics>None</Pics><userid>103041651420405034552<//userid><Date>1614545793055< /Date>< user_name>

Most terrible service, we arrived 10min before our appointment, stayed in line behind a car apparently also in line which was blocking the entry, then after 15min a lady (Asian/Hawaiian) came out to close the gate and tell us she’s closed ( in the most rude and disrespectful way). We let her know we are in line and our appointment was at 6:45pm (showing the paper of our appointment) and it was 6:50pm and we had been staying in line for over 15min ... well she didn’t care, she said I don’t know but I’m closed!!!! Terrible terrible service!!! It’s not like we’re going to do a COVID test for pleasure!!!< /text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I should have read the reviews.....   Actually, after seeing the trailer trash system in person, I should have turned around to save time and stress.    I have yet to receive my results....  And it's passed the '1- 2 days' expedited service.   Avoid at all cost.< /Review><time>1617947354320</time><Response>None< /Response>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) SLOW AND DECEIVING TURNAROUND, DO NOT USE FOR SHORT TESTING WINDOWS

My appointment was about 52 hours before my flight, and the guy told me that most likely it would come back the next day, and if not, then definitely the day after. Well he lied, because when I asked about my test a few hours before my flight while it was STILL unprocessed, customer service told me that day of test AND Sundays don't count in their 1-2 day turnaround. So 1-2 days ended up being 4 for me, which doesn't even fit in Btw it's a "mid-turbinate" test which doesn't qualify for travel to Japan. Just get tested IN the airport, it is expensive but the turnaround was in minutes.

The inspection appointment was 52 hours before departure and asked if it would be in time and was told that the results would come the next day. After all, it was four days later that I came back. (It seems that the inspection day and Sunday are excluded, and the promised 1-2 days were of course 2 days.) Moreover, the inspection required by Japan is "nasopharyngeal", but the inspection is "mid-turbinate", so if the result is returned I think I couldn't use it. The inspection inside the airport is a little expensive, but the result comes out in about 10 minutes, so I think that is better than wasting money in such a place.

Dicen que la prueba regresa en 1-2 días, pero para mí, últimamente era 4 días. El guy me mintío que la prueba regresaría probablemente el día siguiente, si no, definitivamente en 2 días. que tomas la prueba Y los domingos no cuentan (a unque la mía era a las 7 de la mañana), y va a ser 2 días des pués de eso. No vale la pena si necesitas resultados inmediatos.

Btw it's a "mid-turbinate" test which doesn't qualify for travel to Japan.

検査のアポは出発の52時間前でそれに間に合うかと聞いたら結果が翌日に来ると言われた。結局戻ってきたのが４日後だった。（検査日、日曜日は除くみたいでそれに約束の１〜２日間はもちろん２日間だった）しかも、日本が求める検査は "nasopharyngeal" だけどこの検査は"mid-turbinate"なのでもし結果が戻っていたとしても多分使えなかったと思います。空港内の検査は少し高いけど結果は１０分くらいで出てくるので、こう言う場所でお金を無駄にするよりそちらの方が良いかと思います。

We needed a test of less than 72 hours to fly, so we naturally took the 1-2 day for travel pack.
We did not have our results when we boarded our plane! The stress was intense all morning with repeated calls that did not result in any help from the operators.
Fortunately, we were able to do an in-extremis test at the airport (with a test barely tolerated for our destination and much more expensive).

JE DÉCONSEILLE DE LEUR FAIRE CONFIANCE !!!
Nous avions besoin d'un test de moins de 72h pour prendre l'avion, nous avons donc tout naturellement pris le pack 1-2 day for travel.
Nous n'avons pas eu nos résultats au moment de prendre notre avion ! Le stress a été intense toute la matinée avec des appels à répétition qui n'ont abouti à aucune aide des opérateurs.
Heureusement, nous avons pu faire un test in-extremis à l'aéroport (avec un test tout juste toléré pour notre destination et bien plus chère).</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>I attended the 3 day seminar at Dearborn, MI. I came out with wealth of information and ideas on how to own and run an efficient Real Estate Business. It was a life changing experience that opens my eyes into another world of Real Estate Business!! I highly recommend the Fortune Builder seminar to anyone who wants to invest in Real Estate Business.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqWD1h5KEEOwauZGbs0J0yRAQmCCC3nR5r9c0c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS_Dxkf2m9VNzJbIn3AegAvlg8O8D-ZmEf-g5Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< user_name>

The presenters and all involve were very professional and courteous. They also made it fun and relaxing. Given the scope of tools that are made available beyond the workshop, I would definitely pay for when funds become available. I commend Than, his partners, and team with the valuable work that goes into a program such as theirs. I would definitely recommend Fortune Builders to my family, friends, and viewers of this review.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Than
Your 3-day seminar was educating and informative. I never give 5-star rating because nothing is ever really perfect. Nothing against you or the organization you and your partners have created. Dina is one of the most exciting and energizing speakers I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. I could only wish that I were able to join your master class sessions now; but be it understood, once Jessica and I can afford to, we will come to join you so that we can learn from the MASTERS. I thank you for the opportunity to gain knowledge from you and your team. 1-2-3-CRUSH IT!< /text>

<text>We went to the 3 day workshop in Phoenix. It was such a great experience for us. We learn so much!! Dave Seymour was great!! Very knowledgeable, down to earth and it was nice that he was able to relate to us and share some of his life experiences. We left very motivated!! We know this is a process it’s not going to happen over night. We are ready to invest in ourselves to make this happen! We want to be a part of the mastery family! Thank you to the great team we had!! I would recommend anyone to go to this workshop, it will definitely change the way you look at just everyday investments as a consumer. We want to be Entrepreneurs😁

i have had experience in some Real Estate Investing and taken many self-development courses in the past.  I did not have high expectations for this course, in fact was considering whether or not to stay after the first morning.  I was an "I already know this".  To my surprise, this course was extremely well delivered by an very professional speaker.  It was jam packed full of actual useful information, on exactly how to get started, options, tips and new viewpoints that I had never considered before!  This course was definitely  worth the giving up a weekend for.<//text>

I had an amazing time.  Thank you for putting together an eye opening, hope building, fun experience workshop.  This literally blew my mind learning the stuff you guys shared.  I loved how detailed and professional your Mastery Program tools are.  I just don't see how a person can go wrong using the tools you have graciously put together with countless time and money.

Thanks again, and God bless

Fortune Builders conducted an amazing 3 day workshop. If you are interested in real estate then you need to attend at least one seminar. Even if you are not interested in real estate after attending this workshop you present way to gain generational wealth. My wife and I were on the fence about real estate until we attended the 3 day workshop and i honestly can say that it was one of the best decisions we have made towards my financial education. Thanks again Fortune Builders!!!!!< /Review>

The Harrisburg Workshop was a Great! Expert instructors sharing their Fortune Builders success system in an informative and entertaining style. Amazing how hard they worked to address all questions from a large knowledgeable group. I have worked several deals on my own and made some mistakes that cost time and money. Was shown the "back office" and a member support system that no doubt would've saved me time and money. They have a system for any type of real estate plan. I believe with hard work, commitment and the Fortune Builders system I can be as successful as I choose to be. I intend to be part of Fortune Builders for a long time to come.
Thank you Than & JD</text>

<text>I attended Fortune Builders 3 day Real Estate Workshop in Baltimore. I loved the energy and enthusiasm. The workshop was very informative. I met a lot of wonderful people.  It has changed the way I think, and is the beginning of a new journey for me. In my opinion, it is well worth the investment in time and money. I highly recommend Fortune Brothers!

I enjoyed the 3 day work shop. Dina shared very valuable and knowledgeable information. Financially I wasn't able to participate in the school of Mastery, but I was blessed to leave with a new positive attitude that really shifted my mindset on a higher level of thinking. Thanks Than!<//Text>

I had the awesome opportunity to attend the 3-day seminar and it was incredible! One key point that was reiterated over and over again was “changing your mindset” and that is so true. I learned so much invaluable information that I’ve already started applying to my day-to-day life so I can’t wait to see how things go with my future endeavors!

Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and I look forward to working with you in the future.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I spent my last money to attend this 3-day event and hoped that it would somehow change my life.  IT DID!!  Ryan, our speaker, delivered above and beyond what I could have ever expected.  He was genuine, compassionate, and very FUN!  In this short amount of time, my faith, vision, and understanding in Real Estate was greatly elevated!

One of the things I loved most about the event was the atmosphere...I remember feeling slightly uncomfortable being around so many "business people"... But Carlos, and the other staff were so loving, kind & encouraging.  They really made me feel at home.  Thank you Carlos, you are truly a great person!

I am so glad that I did NOT listen to those who discouraged me from going; I would have missed out on such a blessing.

I applaud Fortune Builders in providing such excellent staff and material!  I look forward to working with you all in the future!

I came out of there on fire! Look forward to working with Than, Ryan and his team in some capacity in the very near future!  Loved the training!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It was a lot of information to receive but it was well worth the time and money. My wife and I were pleased with how thought out the course was how it was delivered to keep you engaged. Our presenter was Nate Harris and he poured his all into giving us what he thought we needed to hear to motivate us to take action. It worked! We are now members of the Jumpstart Mastery Program and are looking forward to out first deal. Thank you Than, Nate, and the Fortune Builders family.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

The 3 Day workshop was definitely a defining moment in our lives! We were not able to get started with Mastery yet, but we have by no means been left high and dry! Lots of follow up to help us get started however we can . The mindset teaching was one of my favorite things to learn and I will continue to work on it and many other things as well. Look forward to becoming one of the Fortunate Builders success stories in the near future!! Thank you everyone for caring and helping with my future!!!< /Review>

I've just attended Than Merrill's 3 day real estate workshop in Troy, MI. Incredible is the word that keeps surfacing. The amount of information, the energy... Sean McNicholas is an entertaining and informative speaker. I sat front row and he kept the format interesting and hilarious! The content is not just about flipping homes, it's about building your business, your assets, your network, your future. I highly recommend attending.</review>

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the three day event! By the end of the event I was so excited and inspired to start my own business! The speaker Ryan was very knowledgeable and loved how he incorporated real life experiences, it made it feel more personable. Before my husband and I went to the three day event he was the one that was interested in starting with real estate investing, however after this weekend it was me that wanted to start our business the next day! I love learning new information and I did this past weekend. I would highly recommend going to an event it was definitely inspirational! Thank you Fortune Builders!< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I would like to take this opportunity to share my experience attending the 3 day Fortune Builders class that was recently in Chicago. As soon as you were greeted from getting your name badge, to the time the class started, the team from Fortune Builders were very excited, and motivating. Throughout the next 3 days the motivation did not loss any energy, but in my opinion increased. The knowledge and experience with regards to the team representing Fortune Builders out of this world. I cannot count how many times during the class that our presenter John DeJulio stated something that was new to me. Even when talking with the other team members they informed on how to increase your knowledge on investing, and to be at a place in your live, that you can enjoy your life. One thing that John stated that has suck in my mind is, if there was a class back in high school on how to invest, so many more people will be at the spot in there lives that they could actually live life instead work for life. The statement is so true, and I can contest that it would be so inspiring to be able to live life the way that you would want to. Currently I am in the situation of working for life and I want to be able to live life. This class has opened my eyes to investing and also what I am currently doing in my own life, and how a simple change can make that difference. Thank you again to the team and John for sharing their own experiences, stories, and being a great inspiration.< /Text>< pictures>

The 3-day Fortune Builder workshop was good.  We learned a 'lot' of very valuable information necessary to make sound decisions.  Whether you  are already setup in the real estate investment business or contemplating going into the business, it provided a good foundation and much to work on/towards.<//text>

<Text>Admittedly, I had some initial reservations regarding the workshop and the proposed benefits of attending.  However, the information I received at the workshop was invaluable.  I could hardly wait to share the benefits of attending the workshop and joining up with Than and his team to many of my friends and family.  Who lacks interest in taking steps to achieve financial freedom?  Everyone else, those who earnestly desire to be financially free really will benefit from attending this workshop.</Text>< Pics>

The 3 day workshop was outstanding. It was both informational and inspirational. It reinforced things I already knew and overwhelmed me with things I hadn't even thought of. I am excited to get started. The past is past, the future awaits.< /Review>

Being a realtor for many years did not give me the information that I received about investment and different ways of investment.  To anyone thinking about attending this three day workshop you will come away with more knowledge than you can imagine. If coaching can help you get their I encourage you to attend, you won't be sorry.........< /review>< Rating>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I recently attended the 3-day live event in Fort Worth, TX and I must say that it was the most influential live training event that I have ever attended. Our Speaker was Ryan Burk and his delivery was absolutely phenomenal and I think he's an amazing speaker that is not only committed to his own success but is committed to the success of others as well.

I came to the 3-day event just wanting to know how to flip houses and had no idea that I'd be gaining so much more valuable information. Not only did I learn how to become a successful Real Estate Investor, I also gained world-class financial education that has changed my life forever.

If you are interest in becoming a successful Real Estate Investor and gaining financial freedom, I'd definitely recommend Fortune Builders. They are true to their name and are genuinely committed to your success. Also, the support staff at the live event was phenomenal. They were such an amazing group of people that contributed to the overall success of the event and have your best interest at heart.

Attend the 3-day event, it is definitely worth it. Thank you Fortune Builders!</text><user_name>Adrian Butler< /user_name><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1511417810587< /time>< pictures>

<review>I attended the 3 day event in Trevose, PA. Ralph Plumb was our guess speaker and he was phenomenal. He not only had us engaged during the entire learning process but he also made it fun and made us laugh. He shared his knowledge and expertise on a level that will not only save me a lot of time and research but information I would have never considered. The teaching that was provided has truly allowed me to see the bigger picture and plan and create a foundation that I can build from.  I am truly blessed to have been a part of such a life changing event and look forward to the next one. Thank you Than Merrill and the entire fortune builders team.<//review>< Rate>

Fortune Builders 3 days workshop was absolutely phenomenal and very interactive. Everything was just nicely structured and organized. Ryan was very great teaching and made the workshop very educational in a professional manner, which i really appreciated. Walter was also very nice during the interview and through out the workshop. Generally i will give a 100% for the 2 days i attended. The staff were super friendly and helpful.</Text>

<text>We had a great weekend with the Fortune Builders team team, in AZ last weekend!  I've worked in real estate for several years, and still learned so much from the investment perspective.  The entire team was extremely knowledgeable and energetic (important for a 3-day weekend).  I came away from the boot camp with tons of practical knowledge, that I am able to put in practice right away!

My wife and I recently attended the Than Merrill 3 day workshop in Boston. We arrived Friday morning expecting to learn things, but had no idea that this much information could be passed on to the attendees in the small 3 day window. Our eyes were opened to so many different ways to plan and succeed in so many arenas. The trainer; Ralph Plumb was so well versed and passionate about his training that there was no way you could leave after the event  without being optimistic about your future. I recommend this experience to anyone with interest in real estate or planning your future!< /text>

The 3 day workshop was wonderful! Ryan Carmody, did an amazing job teaching the class. He covered so much information, it really could have  easily been a 4 day workshop. It was so intense, I didn't even leave the room for restroom breaks, until the official breaks, because I was afraid I would miss something. Not only did we learn a lot, but we also did small group activities to help us further grasp many of the key concepts that were taught. Most importantly, Ryan gave us specific steps we could leave from the workshop and start implementing immediately to generate income as a real estate investor. Again, I loved the work shop! I recommend it to anyone serious about real estate.<//Text>

It was very informative and answered so many questions I've had about not only real estate, but business as a whole. For myself, the best part of having questions answered is the new questions that arise. That, to me, is invigorating. My mind has been racing every since. Comparing this class to my college courses, I would put this class as one of my top favorites. And I had some pretty awesome professors. Cole Hatter, specifically, is an excellent conveyor of the material. More than that, though, he was genuine and inspirational. With that winning combination, there is not a doubt in my mind that Fortune Builders is who I will rely on for guidance and coaching into my real estate ventures and entrepreneurship.<//text>< user_id>

<Text>I had a great experience...
I really enjoyed the 3 days, completely worthwhile. The truth is I took the 3 day course with the idea of just trying to get a decent sense of what I will need to focus on in order to invest in real estate... But what I walked away with was way more rewarding and eye opening. Ralph Plumb my instructor did an amazing job not only giving us the foundational framework for real estate investing but an eye opening reality of how important financial literacy is in general and how unequipped we are. I've owned several businesses and I thought I had a good understanding but the information Ralph shared validated that wealth is created on a balance sheet if you're truly looking for life long wealth. What's even more impressive is the fact that these guys do it for the right reasons. Hope to keep in touch with Ralph... Completely worthwhile...< /Text>< Pictures>

The Fortune Builders seminar on Flipping Houses was one of the best investments of my time and money I have ever made.  I learned way more than I could've ever imagined I would have at a Real Estate seminar.  Not only do you learn about Real Estate and owning your own but how to make your money work for you so you can spend more time doing the things you love to do!  THIS IS NOT A SCAM.  Believe in yourself and Than and his team can show you how to achieve your dreams!</Review>

<Text>The 3 day workshop was invaluable! It was fun, motivating, but above all informative. The tax info they give you alone is many times more valuable than the cost of the class.. and that's not even talking about all the techniques and systems they give you for house flipping!< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
On October 20 - 22 I had the great pleasure of attending the Fortune Builder three day workshop.  I attended with an open mind to find out more about what I thought would be information on flipping houses but ended up being so much more.  The information provided was a life changing experience.  Throughout the entire presentation the speaker (Seany Mac) would make comments about coming the next day and the next.  The truth is that with the information being presented I was intrigued for wanting more and wanted to be there for as much as I could get.  Well done and my complements and appreciation to all involved for this life changing experience.<//Review>

This was the most informative RE workshop I've ever been too! And I have been in real estate since 2005.  The presenter was very knowledgeable and he made sure that he explained everything so that even beginners could understand.  I feel like this workshop changed my life!< /Review>

Unfortunately I was not a candidate for the program this year, but they encourage me and given me tools on what to do from here, especially Sean.

<text>I attended the Fortune Builder's three day workshop in Troy, MI in Feb 2018. The event for me was life changing. It was motivating and captivating. It laid the foundation and introduced Real Estate concepts and building blocks that will help me to create my own Real Estate investing business. The speaker John DeJulio was excellent as well as all the other Fortune Builders Associates that were there at the event. Thank you all so much and I appreciate the spark that Fortune Builders has ignited in me to achieve all my financial goals in Real Estate.< /text>< resp>

If you want to see and understand the perspective of an investor, the 3 day FortuneBuilders- workshop meets that goal head-on. No matter what level you are on, the information you receive is very important and should be applicable to your situation as an investor, real estate agent, business owner or user of the systems that are discussed during the presentation.
Lee  gave a great presentation. He shared his experience as a novice to becoming an accomplished investor who managed to survive and thrive by implementing the concept of the systems. He kept us engaged by involving the attendees in the presentation. If you are intent on making a change in your life, this workshop will show you how by dispensing some great information about money and creative financing. Be ready for a mind shifting experience.</review>

I attended the 3 day seminar for Fortune Builders with my husband and was pleased and surprised at the amount of information they shared on how to start and work your real estate business. Than and his partners have laid the ground work and are willing to share what they have learned through trial and error so you don't have to. My husband was skeptical going to this event but went to support my dream.  He definitely saw the vision by the end of the seminar and we are glad we went.< /Review>

<Date>1501892382456< /Date><pics>None<//pics><text>Oh! I really,
wish that I could  write faster than I was able too! There's so, so much information to grasp at Than Merrill's three day seminar that I had attended here in Kansas City, Missouri last weekend. I was never bored, the speaker was very knowledgeable and uniquely special.
He was on point with the audience, (us) in giving up all of his life story, very transparent and a real person. We discovered that he's one of us, with day to day struggles. But, what is different about Than Merrill and those working
side by side, with him is that? They have all overcome most of their struggles by helping others. And this group actually give up knowledge in these seminars. This is a must do, for everyone. I suggest these seminars to any investor, or anyone who has considered being one. This seminar was very motivating for any line of entrepreneurship. Don't miss this one, or you'll regret it.

Thanks for all the knowledge you've shared with me!

Than, I and my Wife, thoroughly enjoyed the 3-day presentation.  We have attended various Real Estate presentations over the last 20 years.  Most often other shows left a key part missing.  The systems included in yours were very complete and the instruction was superb.  We will be following up with your trainer, Lester Scott.  We're expecting to meet our goals and change our lives.< /text>

My wife actually dragged me out, and for once, just this time, I will say that I do not regret it! I went into this as a skeptic and I came out a believer. Never did they say, get rich quick, flipping homes is easy, on the contrary, they showed me how easy it was to lose money fast and how! It was an eye opening seminar and I'm glad that I was able to attend. They, of course, charge money, however they never promise you that it is going to be an easy way to make money or that it is easy! This is a system of coaches and a team that is willing to take you by the hand and guide you through the minor details that matter! They do not promise riches.  You have to put in the work to see results. It is as simple as that!</Review><response>None<//response>< user_name>

Not only is there a great deal of energy, but a tremendous amount of valuable and actionable information that can change your life and lifestyle if you dare to. My wife and I have worked side by side for 25 years and have yet to reach the point where we can step away from our business "jobs". We are both excited to obtain the systems from Than that will allow us to do just that! Real Estate investing will provide us with a much more exciting and rewarding future than the one we have now.

This has been nothing but the greatest experience I've had at the 3 day event. The information was well taught by John! They introduced how the market works and what the steps were to become an investor. It was very inspiring being that I am new into this Realm. Their adviser were very pleasant and willing to help you in every way to be successful. This should be taught in high school. Great job Than team and fortune builders for shedding some light on how investing works. I will be apart this market with the proven tools that was taught ! Thanks<//text>

I attended the 3 day workshop in Atlantic City, NJ.  I was pleasantly surprised at the wealth of knowledge and information they pack into 3 days.  It was well worth the investment and I look forward to being able to implement that knowledge in starting a REI business.  I am also looking forward to be able to join the Mastery program in the future when I am capable.  Well worth the time and money.</Text>

<text>I was impressed with all the different ways to find money, customers, tax savings, the checklists and systems. It's very diversified and the fact that investors are willing to lend so easily. I've done a couple of deals myself but no where near this program will take me. I would recommend that anyone looking to do any kind of real estate transaction take this 3 day seminar. It's worth much more then what they are asking. I'm very excited to get going with this program. I still have a lot to learn.
Thank you for showing me the path of success.</text><date>1502125192654</date></record>

<text>I attended the 3 days workshop fortune Builder event in Cedar Rapids July 20-22, with Dave Seymour instructor, who was very informative and knowledgeable.he explained the benefits for investing in real estate and shared with as his experience with so much fun. This event went beyond my expectation and definitely cleared my vision and allowed me to see the big picture of real estate. I'm very fortunate to have been part of this event and truly I recommend it for anybody who wish to build their foundation on real estate. Thank you Than Merrill and the whole Fortune Builder team.</text>< name>

I truly enjoyed myself at the 3 days seminar in Miami. Jon Steingraber was our speaker and he is extremely knowledgeable. I tried to absorb everything like a sponge. There was so much information. I could only imagine how great their mastery course is. Thank You fortune Builders!</Review>

<Text>The 3 day workshop in Baltimore was very informative. Our instructor Ryan Carmody was insightful, passionate, and explained the information in terms that allowed us to fully comprehend and retain all that was given. The program that Than and his team have created, is amazing although a little expensive, but if followed and utilized, would put us on a path to success!

I've read other reviews, and some people feel scammed, but my advice is if you pay the amount of money for this 3 day class, you should be aware of course it is marketing... I would recommend to anyone wanting to get into this business to attend!!< /Text><userid>106927379406264619270<//userid><Time>1528195931058<//Time>< rate>

<Text>Jon Steingraber and the entire Fortune Builders team presented a very motivating and eye opening 3 day workshop. Self improvement begins with the desire to learn and grow. Knowledge is power and does not become powerful unless implemented. I appreciate the perspective and ethical presentation on proper real estate investing. Jon was an amazing speaker and hit it out of the ball park! Highly recommend this work shop experience to all who desire financial independence and success and want to inspire others to do the same.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Fortune Builders was by far the most informational (knowledge) and inspirational real estate seminar I have ever attended.  I recommend everyone to attend because even the decade old investor can learn more to make more.  I look forward to joining the Mastery in the near future.  Sean McNichols was entertaining while filling us with knowledge to improve our lives and grow a legacy for our children. Thank you for doing what you do and sharing with everyone. Paying it forward.

Phenomenal event, so much information covering a very broad base of topics. Some of these topics were light on details due to time constraints, but even the overview gave me more to think about than I’ve ever gotten at an event like this.

As a jumping-off point, I would highly recommend this. There are ways of searching for this information on your own, sure, but it would take an immense amount of time and you may end up missing certain topics because you may not even think to dig into them.

This is not going to be a one-shot, fully comprehensive seminar on all things real estate, that’s simply unrealistic; rather it should be thought of as Real Estate 101.

There was some of the weekend devoted to discussing the value of continued study in their other programs, but that’s expected for an event like this.<//Text>

Hi my name is Joe Carlson my fiance and I  attended the fortune builders 3 day work shop and it changed our way of thinking. There was so much information that it blew our mind! After hearing all the new information it made me start to think about my life in a whole new direction. Nate Harris was such a great speaker and made learning so fun that I forgot that I was in a class to learn. Everything that he shared with the class got me and my fiance' Stephanie so pumped and ready to start our own adventure in real estate investing! BOOM!!!< /review>

Lots of great information, also lots of marketing for their mastery program. The information I gained was incredibly beneficial to my life and my future. Even if I do not attend the mastery class, $197 is well worth the foundational knowledge that was shared. It was difficult to take notes! The speaker would get sidetracked at times but I stuck with the point he was trying to make, and he always came back to it! I served in the military for 7 years, I had some terrible experiences working with some bosses that have left me incapable of ever stomaching the headache of it again. I am at a point where I have to decide where I want to go now that I am out, and this workshop showed me new ways on how I could build my way out of the maze! My college business class cost me around 600 dollars this semester(Approximately 5 months!) but what I got out of these 3 days only cost me 197 and was much more valuable. However I came in with 0 knowledge or experience of real estate, just basic business and finance. But I am completely motivated to take my next steps in a new direction. Again, there is a lot of advertising, but just how dedicated are you if you can't sit through a few commercials to get to your goal. If it scares you away then good! Less competition.<//text>

<review>Ryan Carmody (Trainer) and The Fortune Builders Team recently visited Chicago and "Knocked It Out Of The Park!" in my humble opinion.

The entire team delivered a complete sense of honesty, integrity, transparency and just a genuine feeling of wanting to help by answering all questions and offering coaching when asked.

Given my 20+ years of experience as a mortgage loan originator, R.E. office manager and general contractor I have seen most of what is taught. But the way it's all packaged into systems making it easy to manage allows even the most experienced to "Hit The Ground Running" saving time and money in the process!

Fortune Builders has truly achieved mastery in all aspects of their business. Everything from how confident and professional their team is to the high quality of the materials they provide. A "Top Notch" organization. I have the highest regard for this company and will be sure to recommend them to all of my friends and family.

Thank You Fortune Builders!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05</Gmap_id></record>

I attended a 3 day workshop in Arlington, Virginia (September 1-3) and was amazed at how much information I didn't know I didn't know about real estate. I had very basic knowledge about real estate and went in with an open mind to learn more. It was very informative and educational. Fortune Builders had a great presentation team that delivered the information in an easy to understand manner and was really motivating and inspiring with their individual stories of how they got to where they are today. Leaving the workshop got me fired up to take the next step to start and grow my real estate business.
Thanks to Than, Paul and JD for starting Fortune Builders and taking financial education to the next level.</Text>

I attended the 3 day Real Estate Workshop and was astounded by how much information they give you to help improve your current real estate investment business or start a new one. I came away from the experience feeling that I received a more useful, relevant & profitable education in 3 days than I did from my years in college. Thank you to the Fortune Builders team for a truly rewarding and encouraging experience!</Text>

I attended the 3 day event in Charlotte. 3 full days of information and ideal connections. Even if you are already connected in real estate you cannot pass up the opportunity to further your education. This a Win Win Deal.<//Text>

<Review>Aloha everyone, My husband and I attended the 3 Day Workshop on May 4,5 and 6, 2018 here on the  Island of Oahu. It was super amazing. My husband and I were totally blown away. There was so much knowledge and wisdom that was poured out to us, that our minds were totally blown. Ry Ry (Ryan)who was our speaker is such an Awesome & Amazing  teacher. He has taught us not only how to Invest in Real Estate  but he taught us how to change our mindset from having a Consumer Mindset to having an Investors Mindset which makes a big difference in your life. He has taught us alot and also shed some light on some things with a spiritual emphasis. You would have to be there to experience what we have experienced during this 3 days. The Team was also so welcoming, outgoing, knowledgeable, exciting and uplifting. My husband and I had such an awesome and amazing time during these 3 days that we really didn't want it to end. By the time we left there on the last day our minds were transformed and so was our spirit. We are super motivated and very anxious to be apart of this Amazing Team. We are very Blessed to have met this Amazing Team .
Mahalo ( Thank you) to Fortune Builders and Ry Ry (Ryan) for a very Blessed time & Opportunity.
If at any time you get the chance to attend a 3 Day Workshop with Fortune Builders, take the opportunity because you will not be disappointed.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>I attended the 3 day workshop with Ryan Carmody, and he was AMAZING.
I usually don't leave reviews but from my experience at this workshop, I really feel that Than Merrill and his team have the right coaching and systems in place.
I'm so glad I attended this workshop with Ryan Carmody,  he MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE .
Thank you Than Merrill for choosing a great team.<//text><UserId.>112031885323746060717</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05<//gmap_id>< time>

I want to thank Than Merrill and his partners for providing great information about FB Investment education. I want to take full advantage of the opportunity to learn and grow though your program. I'm working on cleaning my credit and clearing my mind so that I may be a good candidate for your program. Thank you so much for the information in the 3 day workshop, I now see the other side of the coin.</Text>

The amount of information that I received at  the Fortune Builders 3 day workshop was more valuable than i could have ever imagined.There was so many things that i did not know about starting a real estate business and i am now more confident that success is in my future.

I had a fantastic time. The workshop was very uplifting and heartfelt. My wife and I attended and it was one of the best, of not the best decisions we could have made. The speaker, Lee escobar, knew how to keep the attention of the crowd and really got through to us! If you have not attended one yet, I encourage everyone to take a fortune builders seminar and change the way you think today!!</Text>

I was able to attend a 3 day workshop in Cincinnati the teacher Dave Seymour was great and very passionate about teaching everyone what he knows about real estate, it was very enlightening and Dave and the staff made us feel like we belonged there, I hope that I can go further with the classes hope to see you all again one day.<//Text>

I am in awe of the education and value my wife and I have received at the 3-Day Workshop. Even though we were not able to join the FB Mastery, it was so damn valuable of the education we got that I believe is more than the cost of the workshop. This will forever impact our lives from this day forward. We couldn’t get in the Mastery so they gave us advice and they followed up and made sure we were on the right track so we can then become students of FB Mastery. Don’t think about the cost of the workshop but the value you will get. Nate Harris was awesome!< /Review>

<text>Fortune builders is AMAZING, I've learned a mass amount of education that I had no idea existed. "He who knows anything at all, knows he knows nothing at all". Continue being the great educators that you are, I'm sure this will change more worlds than many other facets and institutions that have tried for many years prior. BOOM!< /text>< gmapID>

This group of people are a class act! They were so nice an welcoming. I attended their 3 day workshop and learned some priceless information. The class is over and they are still assisting me in reaching my financial goals. My favorite thing about this group is they have an excellent set of standards/ morals. They do not just make money and keep it all for themselves; they give back and invest in the communities!  I go to training's, professional developments and seminars every year and this is the best one yet! Ralph Plumb was a great presenter and his team was equally great! THANK YOU Fortune Builders!</Review>

I had a great time at the workshop Sean made me feel like I was a team member I felt like I was a light year away from my current situation I was a consumer for all my life it was an inheritance from my family but Than Merrill's system work through Sean gave me a wealth of knowledge that money can and can't buy they taught me how to gain assets and release liability because of him I'm going to gain the assets I need to grow and release and leave the liability behind trying to start a debt-free life and create Financial Freedom amongst a lot of things that I'm going to do I'm going to be a residential redeveloper and not only build myself up my family and my community I'm also going to show people there is another way to grow I am now an investor for life Letterman's no one else will take me to the cleaners I want to thank Than for taking the risk to pull himself up and bring the rest of us with them I'm going to do my best to work forward to become part of the team and thank you Sean for opening my eyes to the wealth of knowledge out there< /Review>

I had an experience of a lifetime in the three day class. I felt that Dina cured me and . hundreds of other people's way of thinking, about money and or credit,  being the cause of why we can't start a business to succeed. If I had to put a price tag on my experience there it would be ***priceless*** Thanks a lot FORTUNE BUILDERS !!!</text>

My husband and I learned more in these 3 days than we could ever have imagined! The staff was Ralph Plum and his team and they were the best! They were all patient, kind, and considerate! Ralph was serious about teaching us what he knew we needed to be successful but on top of that, he was funny and again patient! We sat in the front row all three days and have 2 notebooks of notes! We are continuing on getting help and just love what this has brought to our lives already! I have not even ever bought a house in my life yet and I know for a fact that our plan is going to work and with the help of FortuneBuilders, we are going to be successful in all areas of real estate! Thank You!< /Review>

<resp>None<//resp><review>I recently attended the 3 day workshop held by the Fortune Builders  Company. It's a company that teachers and mentors people how to be investors. I thought that it would be a class with just spot on detailed info on the processes of how to be real estate investors, but it was so much more than that. This class focused on not only building wealth through investing, it focused on the building of a person's thinking towards a more positive self. I can't believe how 3 days pushed my depression, and my energy to a positive place. i see clearer now and I am ready to take on this world. Thank you, Ryan Burk. I will forever remember Fortune Builders and I will forever remember you.< /review></record>

As expected, Fortune Builders' Rehab Bootcamp was top notch!  It exceeded my expectations with JD and Shawn's thorough education, which was also so beneficial.  It was awesome to be among the original threesome who founded the company, and all of the folks at the specialty booths.  I am really looking forward to my first rehab and the next Fortune Builders Event!

Thank you all!<//Review>

I highly recommend Fortune Builder's 3-Day Workshop. I took a half notebook's worth of notes from all the great information. I loved that we not only covered real estate investing, but also general financial literacy including savings and retirement accounts, investing, and taxes. It really opened my eyes to a lot of things I didn't know I didn't know. And Seannie Mac was a great speaker----energetic, engaging and a wealth of knowledge.</Review>

<Text>It was a "GREAT Learning Experience" that can fuel your vision for Real Estate Investing.  The instructor Dina, had great insight in the application of the material that is practical and relatively easy to implement through trusting your coach.  Real Estate investing is "NOT" for the faint of heart but can be less stressful if you "follow the leader that has PROVEN RESULTS!!"<//Text>< Pictures>

I was a guest with no exposure ever to the real estate market. The three day training offered by Fortune Builders blew my mind! There was so much useful information, that I believe I can utilize what I learned to invest in a property. The system is easy to follow. Anybody looking into real estate would benefit from the valuable information that is shared.
Thank You, Fortune Builders for everything that your company offers to help those interested in real estate!

<review>The training was very well delivered with a little humor in it. I would like to thank John for a job well done.
My goal for attending the training was to gain knowledge about the real estate business and I got that.

Even though I was not able to register for Mastery I did gain a lot and I intend to use it.

Sincerely

Vinoliah<//review>< Pics>

Our host, coach, mentor and Presenter was Ralph Plumb and after the first day....I was blown out of the water! I never thought that there was a whole other side to Real Estate - the Investing side!!! It put a whole new light on the phrase "the more you learn, the more you earn"!
Ralph was professional, pleasant, courteous, he knew his "stuff" and he definitely knew how to get it across to the audience. Most of all he had a sense of humor....and for me that goes a long way. He kept us  participating in the discussions and that made it even more interesting.  I can still hear his voice in my head :).....I am so glad I attended that workshop. When I grow up, I wanna be like Than or Ralph or JD or Paul or Konrad.</text><Time>1528756360824<//Time>< Rate>

The Fortune Builder's three day workshop was organized, lively, and very informative. I have no doubt the systems they have in place will assist in becoming a successful real estate investor. If you are interested in pursuing real estate investing, whether full or part time, I would highly recommend this event!< /text>

The three day seminar that I attended the week of April 21-23 in Maine was life changing and amazing.  I will start by saying that Dina, the presenter, and the staff showed their warmth through out the seminar by demonstrating true empathy and encouragement to all of us present.  The development of the teachings and techniques were presented in such a way that it made everything seem possible to accomplish, not easy, but possible.  The inspiration behind every lesson taught me that this is the time. This is my moment.  I was not able to begin the mastery program during this weekend, but I am turning every stone to find the finances to begin the mastery program.  I am going to accomplish this thanks to the inspiration of the seminar, the presenters, and the motivating short films from FB success stories.  Thank you Than, Dina, and all those who have gone before us who showed us we too will be successful. Thank you< /Text>

I learned so much those three days, things I never knew about real estate, heck quite as its kept I didn't know anything about real estate. This has opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities in real estate I have so much information running through my head and that's okay it's good information.

I attended the Internet Intensive Boot camp in Baltimore Maryland, April 2017.  The name says it all.  From day one, we were treated to a fantastic, energetic learning experience - from the extremely knowledgeable instructor Bob McIntosh to the support staff in the room - all were truly caring, responsive to our questions and supported us every step of the way.  We learned from each other as each participant brought his or her own experience and shared with all of us.  The handouts and learning material will be of tremendous help as my staff and I move forward with the implementation of our next steps.</review>

This 3-day workshop was one of the most empowering experiences I have encountered, a plethora of information. I learned a lot on financial literacy that is NOT taught in the classroom and I have "three degrees"! I thank you Than Merrill and your team for doing me such a service. For anyone contemplating whether to attend......JUST GO!!!

Was very impressed with the system, wish I had the money to invest. At the end of the 3 day seminar when my partner and I had our interview and was accepted into the Mastery program, we explained we did not have the finances at the time to invest. We were promised a specific package that was not honored when they called us the following. Very disappointed in Fortune Builders.</review>

The 3-Day event was very informative, alot was covered in a three day period. With that being said, imagine what would be covered in the mastery class, I highly recommend going to the 3-Day event if the opportunity presents itself.<//review>

<Review>The 3 day seminar was very informative. Lee Escobar was very profesional, and knowledgeable in what he taught, and also I believe he was very sincere. The systems they offer to me are very good. Than Merrill's story is not a rags to riches story, but a story of a person who went through trails and a lot of work, which gave him experience and knowledge to get him to where he is at today, and I respect that, good job.< /Review><Time>1527120774299<//Time><gmap_id>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05<//gmap_id>< rating>

<text>I do not regret attending this 3 day workshop/seminar in Honolulu, Hawai‘i. I was lucky enough to be invited by a good friend. It was captivating, insightful, and enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for change, knowledge, and the education needed to pursue investments. There were people of all ages, and different careers (even realtors/real estate agents) that all gained knowledge within 3 days. The first day within itself was eye opening! I would do it again!</text>< Pics>

<Text>As someone who is new to real estate, this event was very good! It was an energetic and fun learning atmosphere. I learned a lot!  Sean Katona did a wonderful job of keeping the room upbeat and attentive throughout the event. Great job Sean! When  I found out about the Mastery Program I thought to myself YES I need to get into that! I could be taken by the hand and shown step by step, with support, how to do this right. Unfortunately the price point was to much for me to take advantage of the program.  All in all it was a great learning experience.< /Text>< Time>

<Date>1513028034935<//Date><Text>I thoroughly enjoyed this ENTIRE real estate presentation. I have never sat in a training or meeting that lasted as long as this and stay awake, enthused, attentive and interested the entire time. The information was excellent! I couldn't believe how much I learned about real estate! Of course, I can't leave out the best part of the class which was our instructor John DeJulio. He was amazing! Very smart, very funny, and creative in his approach to relay the information. With so much information, I'm so glad he wasn't a "Ben Stein" -type presenter :)<//Text><GmapID>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05</GmapID></record>

<Text>I really enjoyed the 3 days workshop I attended with my sister in Chattanooga, TN.  I would of applied for the Master Program but my husband did not support my decision.  I feel if he had been through the workshop with me he would understand what a good system you and your team have put together.  Looking for the next time you offer it in the Chattanooga area. Hopefully I can get him there with me.  My sister and I learned a lot and felt as if we had been to business school each day.  Lee
Escobar did a great job teaching us about real estate.<//Text><Date>1523312094448<//Date>< name>

After working 8 years as a Financial Adviser and another 8 years as a small business owner I would recommend this workshop to anyone who is thinking about real estate investing. And many of the topics would be helpful to anyone thinking of starting any business.

I recently attended a three day in Albany New York, my brother had been really excited, and talking to me about this for the past year. It’s not that I didn’t believe, just not sure really where to start, or why I’d want to, quite honestly~ I love what I do! I’m so grateful to my brother for signing me up and attending this class with me!  Shawnee Mac was our coach for the three days, he and his team really bring it in a fun, and exciting way! I’m so grateful to have learned so much in such a short time, and even more importantly to realize my Why! I’ve never been driven by money.(That’s what I though flipping houses was about) For me it’s always been about people/community.
Once I realized ALL the people who would benefit using your system~ I was instantly on board! Just sense being back home in New Hampshire, and talking about my weekend, I’ve people asking me “when are we getting started?” And asking if they can be involved as an investor, even offering names of contractors etc...
Can’t wait to find my 1st deal :)

So it's time to get going and pull myself up by my bootstraps to reach a point where buying FB resources shifts me into high gear.

I really enjoyed the 3-day event  with  Fortune Builders. Words can not convey how excited I still am right now. The level of education on Real Estate Investing did not match what we paid for. The information was worth thousands. We was given so much valuable information. All I know is my life will never be the same. It's not If, It's when.
Thank  you Than Merrill  I sincerely appreciate you and everyone else on your team.  Yvonne Smith<//text>

I was fortunate to be in the audience for three consecutive days at one of Than Merrill workshop seminars, hosted by Jon Steingraber.  The information that I received was immeasurable, it was second to none.The knowledge shared is one that I will draw from for a lifetime.<//text>

<Text>I had an amazing opportunity to go to a 3-day seminar with FortuneBuilders! Hands down, best 27 hours I've ever invested in furthering my education. Cole Hatter was the speaker, he was engaging and well educated. In 27 hrs between 3 days, he never stopped to look at notes, forgot what he was gonna say, or lost his train of thought. This guy is the real deal! I would recommend this class to anyone looking to expand their horizons and learn how to further your personal and financial experience. Totally worth the price!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I have been to several different real estate seminars but this one is the only one I am investing in. FortuneBuilders has a complete system designed for asset protection and efficiency designed from day 1. The whole staff was professional and very courteous. They are very knowledgeable and had no problem answering questions no matter how stupid you may feel your question is. I have learnt more about real estate investing in the 3 day workshop from FortuneBuilders than I have from several other companies. I cannot express in words how proficient the training program is. It is a comfort to become part of a family with a proven track record of real estate investing that can be duplicated. Last but not least I have never been to a seminar that conducted a survey after the seminar let alone value my input as well.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05</gmap_id>< name>

Cole Hatter was the trainer/presenter at my 3-day event.
I am a teacher, and I know the value and importance of delivering/presenting information in an organized manner. That can make the difference between comprehending the material--and therefore feeling confident with the knowledge acquired--and getting overwhelmed and not wanting to even deal with RE.
Cole not only was very organized in his delivery, but his humorous and touching anecdotes made a connection by being down-to-earth and allowing us to see our own struggles and knowing we can rise above it all--with our good efforts and proper due diligence.

Thank you very much,

Awesome program. 3 day workshop very informational. They go through the slides pretty fast but if you're able to write fast or have a partner take notes from bottom of slide and you do top you will be fine. New to real estate so I learned a ton. If I had the money to get into mastery I would definitely join. They also follow up with you the day after. Once again giving really good information. I am a coachable person I just did not have the funds even at a discount rate. I will try my hand with wholesaling to get the money. I have nothing bad to say about the program at all.</review>

My experience going to Than Merrill's 3 Fortune Builders workshop in Waco,TX was absolutely worth it. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout my time at the event.  Listening to what Ry-guy had to say really open my mind to different horizons. I definitely forward to joining the real estate business very soon.10 stars would be the perfect rating overall.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>The Fortune Builders 3 day seminar led by Jon Steingraber was excellent on all levels.  Jon was energetic, enthusiastic, transparent and he kept the seminar fast paced and interesting.  His authenticity and in depth knowledge of real estate investing and his grasp of the numbers that go with it was quite amazing and evident throughout.

The 3 day seminar was very informative and a good overview for someone like me who is new to real estate investing and just wanted to learn more about it and to understand how Fortune Builders operates and what they offer.  I loved the fact that Jon shared actual real properties in the surrounding areas that I am familiar with that could be looked up and actually seen.  No shenanigans whatsoever.

As I expected there is an upsell for the Fortune Builders Mastery programs which are very enticing and are of course a substantial investment as any decent business opportunity is.  I chose not to sign up for the Mastery programs at this time and at no time did I feel pressured by anyone to do so.

My overall impression of Fortune Builders and Jon is that they approach real estate investing professionally, properly, and with a high level of integrity and they offer a very solid, repeatable system to support people with real estate investing.  Just be sure it is right for you and that you are taking this on as a business and are strongly committed if you do choose to sign up for their Mastery program.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Hello All,

Attending the 3Day Event with FortuneBuilders was very Enlightening and quite Inspiring. Even when you think you may know how some things work, you end up finding out, there were some areas you don’t know. I really appreciated being a part of this great teaching base environment. I attended Feb 9 - 11/2018 at Hoffman Estates, IL. Cole Hatter took us on journeys that made you think and to remember real life moments happen. This isn’t easy, but doable, when you follow the system. Plus, his Team were very attentive and Awesome! Shout out to Carlos Espinel!
I will Tip my Hat to Than, Paul and JD for creating opportunities where others can not only Hope and Dream, but can Build towards them.
So, if you choose to attend one of these events, I hope your experience is quite similar, if not better.

Thanks< /Text>

This past weekend I was fortunate to attend the FortuneBuilders 3 Day Real Estate Workshop in Austin, TX. The information presented by John DeJulio was invaluable. I don't think that anyone who attended the event left the same as they came in.
John presented information that pertained to the Real Estate Investing world, but also shared so much information that pertained to the big picture of the financial situations that people are involved in day to day.
The knowledge I gained from that workshop is life changing. I have already taken steps to change the way I think about money and how to use it as an investment tool.
I highly encourage everyone to take this workshop. At the very least, you will get invaluable information from it and it will drastically change the way you look at your financial future and start making changes!
Thank you so much to John, Than, and his team!<//Review>

I didn't know it was possible to learn so much in only three days. I am very new to the real estate industry, I know practically nothing about it. But after listening to Jon Steingraber teach all of these seemingly impossible strategies and formulas. I feel confident that I have what it takes to be successful in this industry. It's only been one week since I've been to the seminar, and representatives from Fortune Builders have been contacting me to help me progress in my journey to becoming a Real Estate investor.< /review>

WOW! My brain is still in overdrive at all the stuff I learned! Not only dealing with Houses, but your taxes and 401k plan. There is SO much information out there that the Government does not want you to know. These people, (Fortune Builders) have done their due-diligence and know how to help us! I'm currently working on getting into the Mastery program. I'm so excited for my future, I feel like I have FINALLY found my purpose in life and my goal for 2022 is to be a millionaire! I know I can do it by following the guide lines that Fortune Builders laid out for us. Thank you to the entire FB team for helping others succeed!</Review>

<user_name>Jesus Is Lord</user_name><text>My three day experience at the Boston work shop was mind blowing. The atmosphere and the learning experience was phenomenal. One thing I saw and experienced was intergrity in the team and the business ie they say what they mean and mean what they say.I went home “tanked up” with knowledge I would not otherwise obtain from any other source.

I thank all those who took part in the organization of this work shop and the opportunity I have to be surrounded by world class talents led by Than Merrill. Love you all I am inspired.

Having always wanted to learn about real estate, after hearing Than's post on the radio I decided I would try to pick up as much knowledge as I could from this. After the first seminar I was looking forward to expanding my knowledge in real estate at the 3-day workshop, but I was not expecting to learn as much as I did in 3 days.. Being financially frugal I hesitated on paying for a minute, but nothing worth while is free, and after the first day I left feeling like I got my money back already..
Investment into good education truly pays the best dividends and Than's workshop is just that.

Our teacher in Nashville, Mrs. Dina, did an excellent job explaining multiple topics descriptively in those 3-days. Before I left a staff member there told me that somebody would follow up with me soon, and a day later somebody did. This seminar is definitely something different from traditional seminars in that the people teaching this business really care.

Real estate investing is not a simple business, but the workshop definitely gave me some great knowledge that I can work with. I look forward to coming back and continuing my education with them in the future. Thanks Fortune Builders.<//review>

I cannot express how informative this 3-Day Training Session was for me!  It was exciting, uplifting and just a little overwhelming, but makes you realize how imperative it is to have have your business fires stoked by others who can, have and will envision the same things you do.  My trainer John was AWESOME, and the entire team that was there all weekend with us was great!  Thank you all so much!

Than, I admired you during your time in the NFL. I appreciate you for helping me to improve on some of my DIY ideas. But, I love you for showing your love of people with Fortune Builders!  May you continue to be blessed for reaching back and sharing your blessings with others.

Sincerely,
Ms. Tammy Zaakyaa Boxton</Text>

<Review>Hi
My name is Kathleen and I want to thank the staff at Fortune Builders for a very informative workshop.  I have attended  quite a few workshops but this one included some fun moments.  I not only learned so many things I did not know I was uninformed about but Fortune Builders provided the answers.  I look forward to putting into action what I learned.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I recently attended FB 3 day workshop and it was amazing . I Honestly attended just hoping to learn and understand more about investing but what I learned was far more valuable. The first day I learned that I was under valuing myself and in order for me to be successful I needed to change my mindset.
Although the trainer Ralph Plumb had a team I was honestly impressed that he made his self accessible to everyone who had a question.
It was a great experience and Ralph was and excellent trainer.<//Text>

<review>Had a great week at the Baltimore Boot camp !!! learned a lot of new real-estate techniques in a very short time, Meet a few of the Top people responsible for the operations in Fortune Builders,  Than Merrill took the time to take a picture and answer any and all questions that you would want to ask about the programs, also had a chance to go and sit down and have breakfast and talk with JD Esajian Face to face and just be in a normal environment and connect about basic life situations, was a great experience, I would recommend anyone and everyone go to a Boot camp and see for yourself the wealth of knowledge you can gain from attending.< /review>< Pics>

Than's 3 day workshop was packed with educational and directly applicable investment skills all sandwiched in a punctually followed timeframe of 9:00 - 6:00 pm. I was a new person to real estate  investments while my son was experienced and we both walked away invigorated with new skill sets and a clearer vision. I highly recommend people who want to learn, grow and ultimately thrive in today's real estate investment market attend Than's workshop.< /review>

<text>Exceptional,...absolutely life altering information broken down for comprehension sake.  Your personnel was was approachable, helpful, patient, and willing to share their knowledge even during lunch breaks.  They are obviously an extension of their leader.  The three days was mapped out for you to succeed I totally believe that,....I have 19 pages of notes to prove it!!! I am still in awe as I begin my journey.  Thank you again for such wonderful staff, its almost unheard of in this day in age, you go the extra mile Than Merrill and for that I am truly thankful. 2018 is a brand new year for a lot of lives thanks to that 3-day training!!!

<Review>Attending the Than Merrill 3-day workshop in Denver Colorado was worth at least $20,000,000 to me, and YHVH (GOD) willing,
I will prove that over the next few years. :) With the scalable techniques and systems taught by our fun and "unsinkable" instructor John Dejulio, I now have the vehicle to fulfill my obligations to my fellow man and give back what I've been given. Thanks so much Than Merrill, John Dejulio and the entire team! I'm looking forward to working side by side with you all in helping give back to those who are willing to work hard for their dreams too!

Shalom (balance and Harmony) to you and yours.< /Review>< pictures>

Went to the 3 day class in Tallahassee FL and thought it was very informative. I learned a lot about taxes,real estate procedures,and how to accomplish buying and selling real estate. Than’s system is a “no brainer”. All procedures are mapped out for you so you can always prepare for the next step.  Good investment</text>

I attend the 3-day workshop in Chicago and I was skeptical but curious. I was blown away with the wealth of information presented. John Julieo and his team were amazing and I am excited about starting my real estate investment business. I thought once I left the workshop I would lose connection with FB, but I am so pleased with the companies follow-up and connections I've made since. Although I wasn't able to move on to the Mastery program, FB still provide some support and guidance to those interested in a RE business. I would give more stars if I could. If you are skeptical, give it a chance. It's a life changing experience.<//Text>

Hi, I went into this thing with a very skeptical mindset. The reason was because I had just been ripped off through an online trading website, where they stole $250,000 from me and practically left me out on the street with my family. So, as you can see, I was very skeptical, thinking about nothing except how they were going to rip you off. As I sat there listening to all the opportunities to and all the ways you can get out of the dumps through real estate investing, I started to think differently. Since my goal was to invest in real estate prior to being ripped off, I felt I finally found the answers I was looking for, only now, I didn't have the money. After the 3 day training, I felt I was equipped to take a leap of faith, without money, but didn't really know how to get started. then, a few days after the training, I was called by one of the coaches from FortuneBuilders. We discussed a few things about the training and how best to move forward. I now have the confidence to move forward and make my retirement dreams come true though passive income and other ways, having the confidence that there are coaches that would help me learn until I become proficient . A big thank you to Than Merrill and his team for helping me realize that in spite of what happened to me,  I can choose to get back on my feet again.<//text>

One day I was at work and a co worker said “I’m tired of working. I’m going to a seminar by fortunebuilders.” I agreed to go with her. The speaker was making so many great points that I had to sign up for the 3-day workshop. BEST Money I EVER SPENT ! Cole Hatter was very knowledgeable on what he was talking about. Not only did he talk about real estate , he talked about things pertaining the economy that even the older crowd didn’t know about. He even told us his back story on how he created wealth for his self. Although parts was sentimental I totally appreciate him telling us . Because if he can do it , so can we. I learned so much from that class.  I highly recommend. Thanks FortuneBuilders!< /text>< username>

My wife and I had a paradigm shift during those three days. We are not the same people we were before  we went. That Monday following, we began the first day of the rest of our lives, we are on a whole different path towards creating life changing and sustaining wealth.

The presentations Mr Seymour gave was “Top Notch High Energy and Educationally Life Changing” all the crew members were amazing, they are pro at what they do.

Over the past few years, I have been going to seminars and lectures about Business and financial freedom. But! the things that were presented at the Fortune Builders Seminar, I have never heard before.

From Following a wealth generating system to True Wealth Generation, Asset procetion, The Truth about The National Debt and My 401K, I could go on and on, very eye opening.

Thanks, thanks, thank you for creating this refreshing oasis of systematic wealth generateing  knowledge available to all who are searching for a way out of the rat race.

Perpetual Blessings to Than Merril and Staff

< Review>
I recently trained with Marvelous Didi! Than’s trainers love working with him and his systems. They teach us how to do tried and true, successfully tested methods of Real Estate Investment - Training and Hands on learning. I am innovative, am an entrepreneur was a teacher and marketer. However, I became disabled and have done four trainings because I am a slow learner and come from a family business background of picking up the costs of other people’s failed RE experience..gaining huge skepticism.  Both Fortune Builders trainers, Ralph and Didi are excellent !! They have helped me break through my fear of the field, while I have been goal oriented to become a Real Estate Investor to find deals. Two other Real Estate Investment Group’s trainings have also solidified, that being well educated about economics with good mentors sets up success deals and flips. Credibility and solid funding techniques applied with correct timing and networking can be done well!! However, Fortune Builders education type is the key. If you want to learn from FB success models.. you are a fit!! I finally feel like I fit!! Didi just pulled me through the last of my wall of fear with her facts and Than’s “ Do The Math!” Numbers do not lie! Because, I finally feel fully educated enough to start being in action, I am now available for lenders to help Raise their return On Investments. (ROI). I know with successfully implemented deals and projects I can attain my goal!! I am “Ready To Go” like a race horse at the gate! Thank You Fortune Builders for not giving up on me and inviting me back!  From one Special Educator to another -Thank you, Didi!  TS<//Review>

I hesitated about signing up, but a great price like that, I couldn't walk away!  I signed up for the 3-day event and initially I thought it was the same REI music. Then our Instructor, Ry-Guy, dude is rad!  He hi-lited financial education, asset protection, taxes, and self-direct roth, & more!  Who would know, not I!  I applaud Ry-Guy on a well taught Class!  You CRUSHED IT, BOOM!  Mahalo for your superb teaching and sharing the amazing vids!  Positive vibes!  If only I started with the FB Mastery first!  What a better path it would be for me to REI!  The best REI 3day class you'll find!   Knowing how it can cost for this kind of education and financial education it is worth it!  You will not be disappointed!  I see how it can result in low risk, high return, and a crush it production!  PHENOMENAL FB MASTERY PROGRAM!  You got 2take this class to believe!  They are workable in having you reach goals!  The work will start with ME!  Building Wealth In The Making!  Mahalo & Aloha, Than Merrill, FB Bros, Ry-Guy, & Team!  #BLESSED😇</review><username>D C</username>< rating>

Hello Everyone. I just wanted to say, a friend of mine signed me up for the FortuneBuilders 2-hour real estate investing class that took place 25 Jan 2018. I, like a lot of people was very skeptical and feared that this was another investing scam. However, I went to the 2-hour class anyway.  In just that short time, I knew what I wanted to, where I needed to start, and how I was going to accomplish my goals to get there. Needless to say, sign up for the 3 Day Real Estate Investing Workshop in Phoenix, AZ.

I attended the 3-day Workshop the 9-11 Feb 2018, and our instructor for the weekend was Mr. Ryan “Ry-Guy” Burk. Let me just say, Ry-Guy is an awesome phenomenal speaker. He is very well informed of todays’ real estate market. I did not know what to expect from the seminar, because I am new to real estate investing, and the entrepreneurial business. I have read a lot of investing books, but did not know where and how to start, and how much money was needed. But I left the seminar so empowered, energized, and hopeful.

Real Estate investing may look and sound easy, but it is not. There are so many areas of real estate investing. You can literally profit in any financial economy (Bear market, bull market, or recession). I am so glad that I followed my mind and attended both events. I can finally say that I am on the right path of changing my life and my family’s lives for the absolute best.

Writing this review does not do Than Merrill, his team, and all of his staff any justice. You will have to attend one of the FortuneBuilders 3-day Workshop in order to understand what I am talking about, and why I am so excited about this program. You and your partners have created an outstanding platform, and I am eternally thankful for this great opportunity.< /Text>

The FortuneBuilders 3 day workshop was very inspiring and informative.  I learned more in 3 days than I have in six months of independent study.  Thank you John DeJulio for being such an awesome and engaging teacher and coach.  I appreciate the factual, motivating opportunity to learn from other coaches who have done the work and are invested in helping newcomers succeed.  I look forward to learning more and joining as a mastery student.<//Review>

<Review>Great seminar experience ! Lee Escobar knows how to keep you attentive with all of the great examples and techniques. He made the class fun and interesting. It was a lot of great information. I would definitely recommend going to one of these seminars. It was a mind blowing experience. Not only that but the coaches that assisted were available to ask them questions. Really friendly and  approachable and full of knowledge. Thanks to Andriu and Chris for all of the questions you help answer !! In general everyone at the event was full of energy and great vibes Megan recived me with a high five. Just a great experience in all !</Review>< Pics>

This was the most rewarding and life changing event ever. Nate was a phenomenal instructor. He was very engaging and informative. The tools and information given by FortuneBuilders, if applied, will change your life and the lives of so many others. Because of FortuneBuilders, my husband and I will have the active and passive income we have always dreamed of. I highly recommend FortuneBuilders to everyone.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I had hopes going in that I'd learn more about the REI business but was completely blown away by the lessons learned in just 3 days. Like a beacon of light the speaker, Cole Hatter, had me completely rethink my whole personal business approach. He showed me an insight on how I could protect my personal and business entities while gaining financial freedom. The Fortune Builders group welcomed me warmly and made me feel like family. They we're willing to listen and offer advice, They opened themselves personally and encouraged us to ask them anything. They offered a very intense course through their Mastery program that would expedite the process of becoming an Elite REI member. Many thanks to Than for Than's Fortune Builders group.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05<//Gmap_id></record>

My name is Jeff VanScoyoc, I recently attended the Fortune Builders 3 day event in Toledo Ohio at the Radisson Hotel, it was an awesome 3 days. The main speaker of the event was John DeJulio, John and his team did an awesome job from the first introduction to get us all involved and to keep the high level of intensity going for the entire time. If anyone had a question about anything John and his team were right on top of it, they kept us all involved, related their past and present experiences and made sure we understood what was be told to us. After attending this event, the urge to get out of my comfort zone was so overwhelming, I'm so glad I'm continuing this journey with Fortune Builders, I believe I can accomplish anything I have put in front of me in Real Estate investing.<//Text>

<Review>I have learnt a lot from this 3-day fast paced real estate training. It was very informative, practical and cost-effective. The instructor Lee Escobar was full of energy. He tried his best to share his expertise on flipping houses from funding, finding, flipping to fixing and fending. He inspired us to change mindset from Technician to Entrepreneur. I had not done any commercial real estate investment before but had been curious about that opportunity. Mr. Escobar's lecture gave me a big picture and details and also answered many of my questions. The third day was the most exciting because Mr. Escobar put everything together and showed us the great result of flipping houses. Definitely this training exceeded my expectation. As a suggestion, it will be very helpful to reserve a Q&A session each day because it will help me to clarify some confusion and missing notes timely.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I attended the workshop in Elizabeth, NJ I've always wanted to do real estate, but didnt know the first about how to begin, our facilitator John Steingraber was phenomenal at showing us every part of the business in detail, everything we needed we recieved, he was not only professional, but made learning the business easy to understand, i would recommend Fortune Builders to anyone looking to do real estate, they are top shelf in this field, thankyou so much for the opportunity and new found knowledge.

Sean Katona was our teacher for this workshop and let me tell you , he did a fantabulous job. If you just listen to the way the workshop starts and how they guide us to becoming harmonious, you would know everything they stand for comes with learning from failures and puttng processes into place. Within the 1st 30 minutes i knew this wa going to be a very educational and fun learning experience. I also knew everything they do has a purpose and when a company has defined there purpose , it's a very good chance there is a roadmap to success. An exact roadmap to success. I was not fortunate enough to become a mastery student because of money but it will not stop me from becoming one in the near future! I know what i need to do!, I suggest this workshop to everyone with goals of real estate in there future!- Cal Blackmore</Review>

<Text>I am totally stoked about the 3 day training, I attended by fortune builders. My brain exploded with knowledge about how to access wealth through real estate. The Taxation session, was the best. I learned how I won't have enough money for retirement if I don't make my money work for me. If you haven't attended one of these sessions it's worth every penny. My husband and I are working with what we learned, planto save every pennie to become a member of the fortune builders family.< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I recently went to the 3 day Real Estate Worshop in DSM Iowa Sept 22-24. Seannie Mac was Leading the Team though the 3 days. I generally have a hard time sitting for more than an hour at a time. This seminar had my undivided attention throughout the 3 days. There so much information to gather and try to comprehend. You had to be paying attention or you would be lost. What I really enjoyed is that Seannie kept the class on track and told us he would take questions at given times and he did not allow people raising their hands to interrupt what he was in the middle of explaining. People tend to interupt instructors if allowed, and it was not allowed. We had all kinds of opportunity to ask questions at the appropriate times.
I was impressed with the entire Team representing FB the behind the scene gals Mona and Marie, and then Coaches Richie, Joe, and Lenard. They made themselves very available the entire 3 days for any questions.
I was very impressed over the weekend and was very motivated by everything being taught and by example.
I have been in sales for 30 years now and have never heard a seminar this good. Usually you get a 2-3 hour maybe a full day seminar and you start falling asleep throughout the day, BUT This Team kept you focused for All The 3 Days! I left wanting more...
I did fill out the sheet to see if I would qualify to join the team on Sunday. Because I have a job making 6 figures now I decided it just might not be the right time for me to take this on at this time. I do want to learn more though as there is so much information needed to understand How to do this business The Right Way!

Thank You Team for an Awesome 3 Days!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01ecf6c8405b:0xe0bda2b5f08b6a05</Gmap_id></record>

The 3 day Seminar was a life changing experience as I entered a consumer minded person and left a Real Estate Investor. Ryan Burke, " Ry Guy ", covered the material very efficiently even in between answering questions on the fly. I learned my Financial Education comes with Investment that some may consider expensive but I consider it an INVESTMENT IN ME and therefore worth acquiring a SYSTEM that is Dummy Proof as I certainly am not the smartest. I have finally found the System, Mentors and Teachers I have needed to become financially successful so I may give back to my Community and the World. Finally I look forward to becoming a part of the Fortune Builders Family so I can make new life long friends and Ohana ( Family ). Mahalo nui me ka Io ( Thanks very much to God ) Aloha me ka Io o oe ( May the love of God be with you ). Aloha< /review>

<Text>The 3 day Fortune Builders workshop was simply amazing. I never would have thought a workshop could be so informative..The Fortune Builders team was so helpful in everyway. My hat goes off to the incredible speaker for those 3 days Jon Steingraber he gave us 110%. We all know Its alot of different people teaching about real estate, but none like this! Fortune Builders is like the Harvard and Yale of Real Estate Investing. Honestly I didnt want to leave after it was over on the 3rd day. For anyone thats truley serious about real estate investing the only way I see to go is Fortune Buidlers. They will truely believe in you and help you if you believe in yourself.< /Text><Time>1507587860111</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

My name Kim and I had to most best time at Than Merrill 3day event inAustin in May2017. Ralph Pramb did a great job of training us about Real Estate ,I learned a lot about  a real estate business .Being able to start a business with very little money and not using my own money.
There was alot of fun and great music and the team that helped Ralph were a great and very helpful and polite,it was a all around great experience being there.
I plan on starting my business soon real soon .I hoping that next semiar that come to Austin I will be there to learn more  and I hope that myself and my partner will be excepted to the Mastery to learn even more . Anyone that wants to get into real estate  go to Than Merrill event you'll learn a great deal about real estate.< /review>

<text>Greetings and Salute to the Fortune Builders. My name is Preston Sain Founder of Grand City Sports Non Profit in Grand Rapids Michigan and I attended a recent Fortune Builders Seminar in our City.

I can't say enough about how awesome our Instructor John Dejulio was.  Great Personality, Extremely Knowledgeable about Real Estate, The CT Homes Systems,  American History, Stocks, Business , Life. John Literally educated us on almost every facet of Life.

I really appreciated how John used Examples from his personal life for example  how he and his wife did their 1st Commercial deal. I was previously a person that never phathomed Entertaining Commercial property. I didn't even want to learn about it honestly but John broke down Commercial Real Estate in such a educated yet simplistic way that I now feel confident that my fiancé and I can Conquer anything in Real Estate.

John Also played Several Motivational Clips that used Sports as a tool for Life / Business inspiration and that was another great
effective addition of the seminar. ( Especially for me I'm a Sports guy)

John always Spoke Highly of Than Merrill the Entire weekend and really represented the Fortune Builders Brand well.  The whole Staff that came was awesome. Special Thanks to Sara. She conducted my interview. She was very very polite , insightful and had genuine admiration for the work I shared with her about my community service in Grand Rapids.

Over the weekend it really felt like I was beginning to gain a new family.  It almost saddened me when it was over  b/c I enjoyed it so much and I truly learned a lot ( wrote alot of notes too) and wished we all could stay connected . Although I didn't make the Mastery Program I am still appreciative of the experience and I will keep up with Fortunate Builders from the Outside or through Representatives when they are able to contact me.I received contact from a FB Rep for continued support and I'm looking foward to that very greatful. Our City /Region is a Hot Market so Whenever You Guys Come to Grand Rapids feel free to Find me if you all Like. God Bless
