I came in after being in a collision with a vehicle. When Greg was finished working it felt like riding a brand new bike. Gear shifts are lightning fast, everything is smooth and my bike looks super sharp. Greg's passion for bike repair is clear and infectious and he kept me up to speed on what he was doing. If your bike needs work take it to Archer Bicycle.<//Text>

<text>Whoah, integrity! Greg worked on my vintage racing bike. The rear gears never shifted smoothly and had been steadily declining. He was able to diagnose the problem immediately and then spent a couple of months tracking down the right part to make the repair--not an easy feat with an obscure bike in times of Covid (when everyone has snatched up spare parts to repair their bike). My gears now shift like butter. Well worth the wait.< /text></record>

<Text>The best mechanic in Oakland for sure. I’ve taken my bike to Archer several times for a tune up, and every time I get my bike back, it rides like a dream. Archer will not upsell you, even if you’re trying to give him money. I’m always trying to upgrade stuff on my bike, and he’ll tell me everything is fine, which I fully appreciate his transparency. Don’t be discourage by any wait times to get your bike fixed, as his service is totally worth waiting for. Even Pioneer Bicycles, an Oakland institution, recommended I go to Archer. Again, best mechanic in Oakland, maybe even the East Bay, maybe even San Francisco.</Text>< GmapID>

Thank goodness for a local bike shop I can walk to. Greg has replaced two rear wheels, rethreaded a crank, replaced a bottom bracket, tuned up my brakes, and numerous other small tasks for me. Always a pleasure to deal with - he's pragmatic, knows his stuff, and has a genuine love of bikes. Thanks Archer Bicycle!< /review>

<Review>Sept 2020 Update:
After a good experience with getting my flat tire fixed, I made an appointment and brought my bike in for a full tuneup. It took a couple weeks but man oh man did Greg to a good job. My bike is over 15 years old and it now feels like I'm riding a new bike. It was worth the wait. Greg is busy and for good reason, he does the job right. If you can wait a little while to have your bike fixed or tuned up, he's the best I know of.

August 2020: Great customer service and fairly priced. Had a flat and Greg repaired it on the spot. Will be bringing my bike back for more service! Be aware for non- flat tire repairs you will need to make an appointment.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Going to a bike shop I always feel intimidated and uncomfortable. Either I am not “cool for the place” and get the lingo or the person working there is grumpy and is being annoyed by my basic questions.
This time was different. I was pleasantly welcomed and the person working here had time to answer my questions. I will be coming here for all my future needs.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Greg Archer is a delight, and committed to addressing bike repair issues at the root of the cause. He knows bikes inside and out, and loves sharing his knowledge and passion with his customers. I don't have to go back to him often, but when I do I can always trust that he'll take care of me and my machine.< /Review>

Great guy! I got a tune-up and went for a ride after. I went down extremely steep hills and called him up after regarding my brakes. He told me to come in, checked them, and educated me on bike brakes such as how to adjust them if needed, checking wear. He went out of his way and was patient. I really appreciate his help since I have little knowledge of bikes. Feel free to pick is brain if you have any bike questions.< /review>

The owner/operator, Greg, is spectacular. Just like his service. Greg has gone above and beyond my expectations for a bike shop by assisting me with many of my unusual wheelchairs and accessories. All with a great attitude and price. Not to mention he knows bike mechanics inside and out. If you live in Oaktown or are just passing through and have any issue with your bike (or wheelchair) Archer Bicycle is without question the place to go. Greg is the man.<//Review>

We stopped by on a "bike shop tour" and fell in love with the logo. They make shirts that we couldn't pass up and have since brought home only to be showered in compliments on the artwork. The gentleman there was super friendly, offering expert advice to a customer- and they had rad cross bikes for sale. Super shop, would be a great neighborhood staple if I lived close by!< /review>

I am very particular about who works on my bikes, and being a visitor to the city, and reading the reviews, I wanted to go here! Mr. Archer gave me detailed instructions on how to get from where I was, to his shop! Very cool guy. Even gave me a map to suggest various riding areas!< /text>

This bike shop isn't the biggest, nor does it sell a ton of bikes/accessories, but the owner is super friendly and kind.

If you need a repair of any kind, this is your place. You can also visit the upstairs art gallery while you wait!< /review>

<Text>I found Archer after my bike's rear tire spontaneously lost air just two days after I brought it out of my storage, where it had remained dormant for almost a year. Greg was extremely welcoming, and got me set up with a new tube and tire in no time at all. The price was very reasonable and I had a great experience from start to finish. Greg answered all of my questions with enthusiasm, corrected my front brake being a little off, and even gave me a brief lesson in how to spot counterfeit bills after I inquired about one posted to his whiteboard. If you're reading through reviews trying to decide which Oakland bike shop to go to, save yourself some time and just head here!< /Text></record>

My favorite shop to date.  One man band with a free replay pinball machine.  He knows his obscure parts and sources and will get the bits you need for a fine urban transport machine.< /review>

Archer is for bikes the car mechanic that you trust but doesn’t price gauge you.  Archer permanently fixed a problem with my rear wheel for less that affiliated bike shops for each of the previous temporary fixes<//Text>

But what he really does is fix bikes, with charming stories, a comfortable style, and all the while, taught me the things I should have known but didn't. And he didn't make me feel like I was dumb.

So now I know how to use the quick release on my perfectly tuned bike. Also I got my shifters fixed. And he installed my bell for free. Because he thought it was cute.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f80b3ff899c03:0x6540164d11e45a4d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Craig is incredible.  He will take the time to teach you about anything you ask about if you want to learn.  I asked about reinforced tires and what else other than Gatorskins there was, he pulls out tire pieces that have been cut to about a foot in length and proceeds to show me  the difference of each, performance vs protection of all.  In addition, while his "tune" is more expensive than your typical one at one of the larger chain shops, you get what amounts to everything those stores sell for a lot more in the "full" or "premium" tune.  He also includes a "slush fund" in your tune of 30 dollars that keeps him from having to call you because a 5 dollar part (like brake pads) are needed!

The gallery upstairs had a photog graffiti exhibit, there's a classic pinball in the store, the items he sells are things he personally recommends and his years of experience spills forth in every encounter.  His turnaround time is generally on par or better (barring a sudden influx of work showing up) than most other stores.  The best part?  None of that "bike-bro pretentiousness" you get at other 'hipster cool' shops in the area.<//Review>

Made an appointment for 9am. Arrived 3 people in line so was about 915 by the time I got to the front of the line. Soon as I gave them my keys the truck was pulled in and immediately started to get worked on. Absolutely the best service iv had in a while. J.J you are the alignment man! I barely have to touch my steering wheel when I drive 10/10 would recommend. Will be returning. With this vehicle or my next. Everyone is polite and helpful.< /Text>

I'll try and keep it short. Sunday (11/30) was looking at getting wheels and tires. I ordered the wheels through Jose (12/1) and was going to order general grabber ATX but they couldn't match the price of the online guys. The online be guys delivery screwed up bad. Weren't going to receive them in time for my trip. I ordered them Monday was told delivery Wednesday. The delivery basically lost them. So Thursday (12/5) went into Les Schwab to check out the wheels that came is on time and fast. Loved them! Then noticed Les Schwab house brand the Mazama (built by same people that make Dunlop and Firestone)  Open Range AT. They had them in the size I wanted. And actually cheaper than ATXs. Russ and Jose made it happen and I didn't have to postpone my birthday trip. I even got an alignment done. The place closes at 6 but we were there till 7. Thanks guys and team! I love the set up! I know your shop is going to be about 45 minutes from Murrieta but I am going to be heading there.

Truck: '15 Ram 1500 crew cab outdoorsman 6'4" bed with Bilstein 5100 level kit on highest (2.8) setting. And upgraded UCA.

Tires: Open Range AT 35x12.5x17. I have about 400 miles on them. Mostly highway. But have drove in the heavy rain and snow in big Bear. These tires handle. Quiet highway ride and grippy wet/snow traction. Plus I got a 65k mile warranty!!!

Wheels: raceline defender 935g. 17x9 w/0 offset. Fit perfectly no rubbing.</Text>

Well knowledged in tires and the stuff involved with steering and stopping. Came in for a free tire rotation scheduled from previous full tires replacement and had no issues. On the positive the youngster that did the service informed me very well of my brakes and their condition and that nothing would be needed there but also let me know that my steering needed work. I was already aware but then he was specific to exactly what and I was impressed to find out what I didn't know from a simple tire rotation what would be needed next. Nice!</review>

Dropped in due to nail causing slow puncture in tire. Fixed in short time, very friendly, very professional.
Made my day when I got the bill - there was no bill!
If I lived in the area I would be a regular customer for sure.
Nice story to share when I get home.
Thanks again to the people at Les Schwab.< /Review>

I caught a nail in my tire and I came to Les Schwab simply because they were half a mile away from me. As soon as I pulled in I was immediately approached by one of the mechanics (Kevin). I told him money was tight and I needed the cheapest tire he had. He said they can patch the tire for free... FREE!!! And that's what he did! Friendly, professional and super fast! I was in and out in about 15 mins. I came to Les Schwab because of convenience, now I'll be coming back because they are simply the best.< /Text>

<Review>They provide excellent customer service. The best in the Inland Empire. Brett and Jose were wonderful. They helped me with a tire pressure issue and repaired one of my tires that had a leak. The facility is nice and clean with water, coffee and popcorn while you wait. They were quick (less than 30 minutes) and professional. I highly recommend them.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Time to buy new tires, not my idea of a good time. BUT just had an awesome experience. Rachel was great; friendly, professional and knowledgeable. The rest of the staff that I met were very friendly and honest, a rare trait when dealing with anything from buying, maintaining and repairing your car. I highly recommend Les Schwab on Van Buren.<//Text>

<Name>Pacific Trades< /Name><userid>104203365397757906327< /userid><Text>I am slowly moving over from America's tire there is no wait here and there was a 45 minute wait at America's tire. They came out to the car and greeted me and generally seem grateful that I was there. Service was even better. However they don't carry falcons but was able to order them so I had to wait a couple of days for my order to come in. From what I have read this company has migrated South from Oregon. My neighbor raves about this place So I thought I would check it out

P.S They clean your rims here< /Text></record>

WOW! Today way my first experience with Les Schwab. I had a tire that needed repair, so I stopped by because it was close to home. After being greeted friendly and promptly, i enquired what the price would be for repair. The answer? FREE! The issue ended up being a small nail that was causing a slow leak. The repair was done very efficiently, and I was in and out in under 30 minutes. I highly recommend this location, and will be returning again.

Also, if you have a Shop Riverside card (only $15 for savings all throughout Riverside), Les Schwab also offers free tire rotation, free brake checks, and free pre-trip safety checks.<//Review>

Greg and Charles took great care of my 2012 Smart Car. They even went above and beyond to let my car stay there while I was looking for a replacement wheel. Great service and fantastic people that get the job done quickly. Would come back here again for future service.</Review>

They beat Americas tire store prices. The warranty was good and i thought they were going to try to get me to buy a bunch more repairs for my car but I was completely happy when they checked my car brakes and alignment and sent me on my way with just tires. They were honest.I am a happy customer. Everyone was extremely nice too...the the manager helped me out alot and was knowledgeable<//Text>

< Review>
Came in unexpectedly with a flat tire and dreaded it knowing I was due for new tires. They got me back on the road in about an hour or so with 4 new tires under $400. Great service and waiting area with free wifi and free popcorn! They earned my loyalty when I lived in Oregon. Very pleased they have expanded to SoCal.<//Review>

<Text>Offered assistance right away.
Pleasant and they looked for what I wanted and didn't try to sell me something I didn't want.
No pressure salesmen are the BEST.
Thanks everyone, keep up the good work.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Time>1519265198260</Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>Kevin approached me before I could even get out of the car. Ask me what I needed was very friendly courteous and quick to the point. I told him I had a slow leak and the front left and he pointed out a split in my tire that I hadn't noticed. He gave me options on several different new tires, and offered a free alignment check. One of the best things they have in my opinion is free road hazard. Most shops charge more for this. I would definitely recommend them to a friend< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Great service, very competitive pricing and know what they are doing. They fixed the emergency break on my SUV, despite going to 2 other places and being charged for a bogus repair. It cost me $25 here! They are honest and fast.< /review>

<review>A wonderful new shop that just popped up. I'm really glad it's there... I just got my 2nd nail or screw in the past 3 weeks.  I pull in and they replaced it no charge. gave me a free estimate to replace my 2 front bald tires.  No pressure and out the door.  once I get my tax refund,  I'll surely head back  to get my bald front tires replaced.<//review>< UserId.>

This place is a joke stay away unless you like throwing money away and the manager Gabe  is as fake as they get he will say he is trying to help but he's not. I'll definitely be contacting the BBB on this place.< /text>

They are so attentive & work as a team! They did not annoy me with small talk! Like other shops! Or tried to sell me what I did not need, their team were quick to answer my questions  & was impressed on how much they cared about my situation. To add on to my experience two days after I had my new rims and tires installed I noticed a big fat screw in one of my tires. I was very worried, so I took it in and even tho I didn't bye my tires and rims from them they patched it up for me free and fast and got me going! My tire shop hands down!!!! I will be glad to do business with them again.< /review>

I drove to 5 places that didn't have my tire size. I drove to this place on a whim, and they took care of me the minute i drove in. They seemed eager to do things, but they fixed my tire in 20 min gave it a tire rotation and everything. The price was a bit high, other than that the service was great!< /Review>

< review>
Visited  this location  for the first time today. No appointment was needed to service my brakes. Upon arrival around 12 noon I was greeted outside by I believe Kevin. Customer service was excellent  at drop off. After a test drive they contacted me as promised. Two estimates were given for the service requested, usually unheard of elsewhere. Green light was given and estimated time of pick up was between 3 to 4pm. job was complete around 3:30pm. Great customer service  pick up & check out. Full Warranty certificate was given and all service was explained thoroughly. If you are to wait in their large lobby, they have both complimentary & snacks and vending machines, restrooms, tv and plenty of seating. Great experience and I hope it continues for future visits with all our family vehicles. Definitely give them a try. Also in Fontana & Norco.<//review>

The staff are very friendly.   The prices are 20 to 30 cents cheaper a gallon than town 5 miles away.   You can get a free small cup of coffee, hot chocolate, or soda with any fuel purchase.   There is easy parking for trucks , RVs and cars.  They have a great selection of snacks  drinks and hot foods.<//Text>

Super great place to hunker for a night on a long drive. I asked to stay (I'm in a pickup) and was welcomed. Security cameras, food, clean bathrooms. The ladies at night were keen and the next morning the two "young" fellas were good for a laugh. Spots for 3+ tractors and vans but I parked enough away as to not be at all annoyed by idling diesel engines. 395 is dead quiet at night here. A gem for a safe night with friendly people and inexpensive fuel (compared to Bishop, Lee Vining and Bridgeport). Will become a regular spot.</review>

Nice and New Gas Station in the Alturas area. If you fill up you get a free small drink. This is the best place to buy gas and is only 5 miles from downtown Alturas. You will see around  30 cents less per gallon for gas. They have Ice and a Walk-in cooler for Beers.<//review>

I found this gas station via my GasBuddy app. I was traveling through Alturas, CA. Although it's a few miles out of town, it has the lowest gas prices around. Very clean restrooms, and an attractive well-designed mini-mart. I was offered a free coffee/cocoa from the dispenser, with my fill up. Friendly staff too!</text>

Wonderful little modern park with lots of stations for children of all sizes to play on.  Came here during vacation with the boys and this park looked amazing while skating around town so we decided to stop by.  Boys had an excellent time here and it is also well shaded.</text>

Great place to bring your kids. Parking is very limited. You need to park on the street.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>. This playground is perfect for young kids. they have 5 different play areas. And the ground is a little bouncy. when the kids fall it doesn't really hurt. I had a14 month old who loved the 4ft slant (slide for babies) she loved that she could do it all by herself. there was even a spot that the older kids were climbing. it may not have been ment for that but it kept then occupied while we played with the babies. great place for kids.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6DogD_P3uHyhasBV4oV76U8EEdSHLJEnrF48=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

Since it's basically on Cabrillo, whenever the beach is busy, parking can be a challenge. There are a couple of pay lots not too far away, so that can be an option too. There are a couple of group picnic area that (I believe) can be reserved in advance for special events like bdays and such. In addition, the rest of Chase Palm Park envelopes Shipwreck playground, so plenty of grassy areas as well a pond with ducks. Overall, great fun for families. Highly recommend.</text>< pics>

Open from sunrise to sunset everyday.  Great for little ones. The play structure is set into sand and the 6-foot-wide slide ends with a smooth landing into sand making it tons of fun for toddlers. Lots of open green space for taking a break. Smooth and wide walkways are accessible for wheelchairs and strollers.<//Text>

<Review>The park is weirdly structured. It's more to please some adult as compared to kids. My son got bored in a about 15mins and asked to go to some other place instead. No accessible parking either makes it even more difficult.<//Review>< Rating>

The playground at Chase Palm Park is absolutely the best in the world you got the TP right across from the beach there's so much going on that's just across the street at the beach and a great place where you can go across the street to the Shipwreck playground and have a great great time with the little ones</Text>

I do not understand why some people on here say bad about the school. I have had a great time here in the school studying my university in Marketing. My professors were very knowledgeable and the staff in the office has always helped me. I will indicate this school to many friends.</Text>

Fake university. There is NO student services and they don't support the students. They don't care about the students.  Be careful with the administrative staff. They are unprofessional and their fail will affect you. Don't trust or count on them. Get everything written/email and double check it.< /review>

The attitude of the front desk is very, very poor. She will be angry and will shout loudly to hang up the phone and so on. I wanted to transfer to school around June and was scared by her. I dare not come again. I wonder if all the teachers are like this.  Seeing that I highly recommend changing to a more kind receptionist, it will bring you a lot of profits. We are three or four people who want to transfer together, so you will lose a lot of students.<//Text>

I don't know why some of the reviews are completely negative, because the school really helps in learning English, my English level has improved several times, especially thanks to Brian!<//Text>

<review>When I lived in my country, I could not get a high salary, because I needed English for this, I found this school on the Internet, and now, two months later I’m already in it!

Great team of educators. I've taken courses off and on for years and they continue to update the campus and enhance the student experience. I spent 1 year in SDUIS. I really like it there. Nice campus, I liked most of my instructors, and liked the classes. Campus is a nice place to be. Every time I've had to visit the financial aid, counseling or admission dept  that they were friendly, efficient and informative! Very helpful!<//review>

<Review>The SDUIS school is, without a doubt, a great school.  Their teachers are incredible, with a clear and objective didactic and the class becomes very dynamic, especially Professor Brenda, who is very kind and attentive to all students.
I spent a great time there and learned a lot, had a fantastic experience and my English improved.
Thank you SDUIS for all the care and dedication you have with each student.< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I graduated “Executive leadership coaching program” at SDUIS in December 2019 and now I’m going through OPT. I should say that SDUIS offers a lot of different classes and programs for international students and residents. Their prices affordable versus other institutions giving the best learning experience and achieving professional goals! I love their office team of highly professional people. Thank you Nikky (and Olive) for making the whole process easy and fun. I should point that teachers are also matched with practical and academic experience. I took so many advantages from classes with Stephanie Clausen PhD organization development consultant, Professor Rene Edward  Ray and Florence Norris.
During all the time I’ve been studying at these institution, SDUIS’s team treated me with great care and attention. I'm also grateful to all people who work with international students for their patient and big hearts ♥️ .

I don’t think you’ll find such an amazing combination of professionalism and real doing to help with your education in just any other University!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I have had many questions along the way that have been graciously answered by the admissions staff. When I was first recommended I looked into the school and compared it to three others.

Well as an instructor there, I enjoyed about ten percent of the students, was shocked at the quality of most of the work, ethics, and work ethic of most of the international students there. It was not accredited when I was there, and the paper record keeping was way behind the times, but it was still a wonderful opportunity to meet students from all over the world.  In the end, it wasn't a good fit for either of us but I still hear from students who I got through to.  Rampant nepotism, small family owned - took some investors over there to possibly make an offer and decided to pass in the end.<//review>

<Text>I will be very honest in this review in order to give you the opportunity to save your time,your money and your life(if you are planning get a diploma from them).First of all, this is not a real university because the standards are the lowest that I have seen here in San Diego among the others college.In general, the staff is rude and not professional at all, they don't really care about you,really...all is about money...really.I would not exaggerate the facts but I think that the worst decision that I took is to make a transfer to this school.

And in case where you have an issue concerning your status,they cancel your I20 with their most beautiful smile without to try to help you as an real University where real professional work, should do it with students.Believe me,you have to save your future and take the decisions which are in the best interest for you, that's why there are plenty of real college in the city of San Diego where you can get affordable high quality English courses given by SKILLED teacher and then get a REAL diploma and be SURE to get a job everywhere.

Don't be fool as I have been.I even not write this review to ruin their reputation because I will get nothing for that.I just want to be sincere as a smart man, about my own experience with them. I hope that this information will help you to take the best decisions for your studies.

Ps: Do your own search on the official (and legal) accreditation service affiliated to a college before to apply. Good luck to you!</Text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

I called this school to get more information about their Masters program in Marriage and Family Therapy. I originally moved to California to further my education after finishing my Bachelors degree and have been doing a lot of shopping around at large schools in San Diego. When I did a quick google search for other programs in the area this school popped up!

When I called this school the receptionist Kristin answered. She was very polite and placed me on a brief hold while the Admissions Department was reached.

I spoke with the Admissions Department for about thirty minutes. I had many questions related to pricing, class schedule, flexibility, Professor background etc. After ending my call I received supplemental documentation to further educate me on the program.

I found myself in Old Town today and I did a walk by Campus. When I am ready to fully commit myself to a program I will be setting up a meeting. Beginning my MFT is a dream of mine and I think I may have found my perfect school. Very professional, and exceptional service.< /Text>

The Staff is always helpful and ready to hear you. Also they promote little events at the campus to integrate the students. Always fun stuff!

Updated on  06.13.2016:
The next day after I posted my review, the management contacted me and we had a meeting. I was given an opportunity to share my concerns in detail and get explanations on why the policies I disliked have to be in place. I was also told that my suggestions and complaints will be taken into consideration in the future. Although this does not fix my past experiences, I believe this was a big step forward and that's why I'm increasing my rating to 4 stars.

Previous review:
I used to be a student at this school.

I give 5 stars to almost all the teachers, the location and reasonable tuition fees. However, I give 1 star to most policies, staff members and their customer service skills.

Their registration system is very confusing and complicated. If you need any type of assistance, it's very difficult to reach the right person and get your questions answered. It takes many hours or days to get simple things resolved. They do not value the students' time at all and there have been numerous occasions when I felt treated like garbage.

The only person who is truly committed to helping students is Elvis.

Please keep in mind that laptops are not allowed in classrooms. Laptops can be such a great learning tool in the 21st century...

If you read manager's responses to some of the negative reviews, you'll see something like "please contact us" but there is no specific phone number, no email address and no name. Good luck trying to call them!

Unless you need a student visa, I recommend this school to people who like to waste their time.</review>

I was teaching there and can tell you this place is a scam.  Management is only interested in your money. Stay away.  There are many other quality colleges around San Diego.<//text>

I finished my MBA at this school last year. I can say that it was a surprise for me to fine a school like this in San Diego. It affords good education with reasonable price. The advisers there did their best when I transferred from Colman Unvversity to this school and were very  cooperative.< /text>

I am a current student in the University programs here at SDUIS I was googling my school for reference and saw the negativity. I have to say that I have had a great time at school learning about the certificate in marketing. The staff and teachers have helped me in learning about a course I don't have knowledge about in the past.
The price is very fair and class times are good. The admissions process took time and I needed toefl. The school offers a toefl test on campus which I took. I have told my friends about this school and many have joined and enjoy their programs.<//text>

I've been studying in SDUIS since March this year and I recommend it for everyone who wants to study abroad. I've been loving my Communication course and learning so much from it...so far I've only had great professors and no complains. The campus has a great atmosphere, and I made good friends among both student body and staff, everyone is very friendly and helpful.
SDUIS has already, in only a few months, gave me several great opportunities and a career that I want to pursue, which makes me so excited about what's to come!<//text>

Had a great experience when took the Tesol at SDUIS. My professor was excellent and gave me all the support I needed to now become a English teacher in my Country.
Also the STAFF was always helpful and ready to answer my questions when I needed.
I'm planning to go back do San Diego by the end of the year and will definitely take my Masters Degree with them again!</Review>

<review>The teachers, staff, faculty and fellow students are all friendly and really encouraging to be around. I am transferring out since I realize I want to be majoring in a major that the school does not offer but I do not regret ever having attended. I learned a lot more about the world we live in and about myself than I would have ever learned elsewhere.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>I went to SDUS to get more information about the MBA program since my current school is closing. I was greeted by the front desk staf who was very kind and was able to make an appointment to speak with Niki. Nikki is very kind and explained everything to me. I am collecting my documents together and will apply soon. She is a beautiful person inside and out. She may be from Brasil but will not speak you in Portuguese :)< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>It's all about money. They don't care about you learn. If you need help to drop off or change your subject out of the date, forget about! They don't care if you are a good or a bad student. The Brazilian that work over there forgot where they are from. So sad we have to study there because of a visa status!!<//text>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Absolutely love this charming little cafe. My fiancé and I were looking for a place to eat last week and noticed that it was one of the few restaurants open on a Monday afternoon, so we decided to give it a try. They are more than just an ice cream place. Their carnitas torta was delicious with crispy toasted bread. My fiancé ordered the ham wrap which was simple and fresh and we split an order of elotes, which you can never go wrong with. Afterwards we couldn't help ourselves and decided to get ice cream too. Everything was wonderful including the service. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Oakhurst area or just passing through.< /review><date>1617493726955</date>< Resp>

<Review>We stopped in to get ice cream on a COVID-19 Friday night date-night. The ice cream was good-so nice to have an ice cream shop in town. But . . . I want to go back for some other food. Everything looked and smelled delicious.  We will be back!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

First time there and I loved it. Torta was flavorful and the elote was excellent. Authentic Mexican food that was anything but dull and reasonably priced. Different items than your typical restaurant. Friendly staff and good service. This place checked all of the boxes for a great local eatery.< /Text>

Very charming little eatery...my hubby got the carnitas torta and it was delicious! I got the chicken wrap and it was very fresh, healthy, and yummy. My son had the nutella waffle and loved it! Our little one opted for the mint chip milkshake, and it is now her favorite milkshake she's tasted! Everyone is so sweet there and we are excited to try more off their menu when we go again!
*Update to my first review: I now go here almost once a week, if not more. Honestly, I am obsessed! The chicken wrap is my go-to lunch or even dinner, when I am in a hurry and need something quick and healthy. I love the mango agua fresca!! It is delicious and refreshing! My son, along with all of my friends that I have brought here, are diggin' the carnitas torta. It is seriously the best torta I or any of them have had! It is toasted perfectly and the carnitas is so tasty. I looked around more, now that I have visited pretty regularly, and the decor is so cute! A lot of time and love went into this place and you can tell that the owner(s) really have a passion for what they do. Lexi and Alejandra are just two of the girls that I know who work here, and they are both Sweethearts and always are smiling and making sure my order is perfect. Thank you, girls! My family and I will continue to support Dulce Sabor for as long as they're around!</text>

This was my very first dining experience in one of the newest offerings in Oakhurst. I was not disappointed in the least! This is a family owned and operated establishment of long standing status in Oakhurst, having another Restaurant which goes by the name " Taco Pazuelas" next to the Met Cinema. When I entered Dulce Sabor I was warmly greeted by Emma, who took the time to explain what a "Sincronizada" was. It is very similar to a quesadilla, it with added ingredients which will not be noted in this review because  think it would be a spoiler alert!  Let me just say that it was most    sabroso (tasty) , which is also the eatery's namesake😋. I believe you will find something here to satisfy your taste buds...give it a try!</text>

We stumbled upon this little place and OMG I’m so glad we did. There’s so much variety of snack foods and light lunches. Wraps, tortas, salads, delicious waffles, fresh fruit, tostilocos, churros, fresh juices, aguas, ice cream, smoothies must I go on? Everything reasonably priced. What I loved the most was the atmosphere. It reminded me of the cafes in Mexico City. Customer service is beyond excellent! Will definitely be back next time I’m in that area. BTW this place is first-timer friendly.< /Review>

Omgoodness..this is a hidden little gem here in Oakhurst. The ladies that run it are just nice as can be and they have lots of treats everywhere! We tried the ice cream today..(the coconut ice is to die for!)..great & reasonably priced. They have some food items which we will DEFINITELY be trying out next time!</text>

Quant little place that looks like it's a cross between an ice cream shop and a deli. The service was friendly and helpful.

We all ordered the carnitas torta and it was absolutely, unanimously delicious! They cooked the torta like a panini and it gave the bread a perfectly crisp and toasty bite. I also had the elote and it was so large I couldn't even finish it with help. It was hot and tasty. Likely one of the best servings of elote I've ever had.

My son ordered the churros with a scoop of ice cream. So yummy!

Definitely going back here!</Text>

Also ordered the Churro Spilt with Ice Cream and all the topping... WOW. Great job guys, so glad we found you.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
FOUND THIS PLACE WHILE WE WERE STAYING IN OAKHURST AND SOO GLAD WE DECIDED TO STOP BY! THE OWNER WAS SUPER FRIENDLY AND THE PLACE HAS A WARM, COLORFUL AND INVITING FEEL. WE ORDERED SOME ICE CREAMS FOR THE KIDS WHICH WERE DELICIOUS (AS MOM I TASTE EACH ONE 😁) I ORDER A WATERMELON AGUA FRESCA SOOO GOOD AND REFRESHING! I DECIDED TO ORDER TIANA'S WAFFLE WHICH HAD FRESH STRAWBERRIES AND A SWEET CREAM TOPPED WITH WHIP AND NEEDLESS TO SAY BEFORE MY HUSBAND AND I WERE DONE WE PLACED AN ORDER FOR A SECOND!! HANDS DOWN THE BEST WAFFLE WE HAVE EVER HAD SUPER RICH AND FLUFFY! EVERY TIME THAT WE COME TO BASS LAKE WE WILL BE STOPPING BY! 😁</Review>

We were passing through the area from our annual Christmas pictures in Yosemite Valley and found this cool spot to eat. Awesome mexican snacks just how I love them. The Carnitas Torta and Bionico were delicious. They just opened too, perfect for this tourist town. Highly recommend it, very nice people!< /review>

(Translated by Google) We are a family of Mexicans who came to visit and we were surprised to discover that they sell cakes and our biggest surprise was when we tried them because they are delicious.
We ordered Carnitas, Chicken and Ham and they were all very very tasty, as was the fresh waters.
The girls who work there are very friendly and I definitely recommend this place highly.
Also the waffles were delicious.

Pedimos de Carnitas, de Pollo y de Jamón y todas estaban muy muy ricas al igual que las aguas frescas.
Las muchachas que trabajan ahí son muy amables y sin duda recomiendo ampliamente este lugar.
También los waffles estaban deliciosos.</text>

I LOVE Bright Now Dental in Murrieta, CA! The techs are so sweet and friendly. They’re happy to stay a bit and chat while I’m waiting for the doctor to come in. They are very reasonable in their treatment plans as well, offering many options. I can’t recommend them highly enough. Thanks, guys! ❤️   —Barbara Lay< /text>

<Review>Had three crowns put on today.  Can’t say enough positive comments about the level of care I received.  The dentist is such a happy guy.  I’ve NEVER had a dentist who was as kind and cheerful.  He put you at ease.  The male assistant who started the process of removing the temporary crowns and placing of the new ones was very professional and was also had a great sense of humor.
Also, all the other assistants and the front office staff were very kind and welcoming.  Highly recommend BrightNow!</Review>< Pictures>

I am so thankful I chose this dentist. He was amazing and the staff was very friendly and helpful too, especially Javier. They made me feel so comfortable and at ease before and during a root canal. I highly recommend them!<//text>

Great place if you like hidden fees not covered by insurance, and staff who apparently don’t communicate with each other.< /Text>

I found 12 fillings a little high when for 24 years she has had a total of 2 fillings. We were lucky enough to get a second opinion only after the dentist did three of them and he refused to do the rest. He was rude and could not deal with her anxiety.  Luckily for the second opinion not half as bad and cheaper. They price gouge people with good insurance. We will not be going back. We now wonder if the three he did do where needed.</review>< Pictures>

Bright now dental is awesome! My whole family sees this dental place and they always make us feel comfortable at the appts., especially my husband whose had traumatic experiences at other dental places so his nerves get the best of him n anesthesia doesn't work on him. But with them it's easy!! I really recommend this place to anyone who needs dental work!< /text>

< Review>
If you have fear or get anxiety when going to the dentist don't come here. I am only writing this review because this is the 2nd time I have had a bad experience here. The wait time is insane. I left the first time after about 50 mins and suggested they let me know if they need to push back my appointment because the dentist took in an emergency. Making people wait with no communication on why is horrible customer service. The fear of the dentist builds as you sit there and wait. This second time happened today. I showed up a few minutes late for my 10:10 am appt and there where a few other people in the lobby waiting. I got checked in and then waited. No updates. As it was reaching close to an hour wait, I couldn't handle the anxiety anymore and asked how much longer. They said in 5 mins which they did. The dental hygienist was great. Got me in the chair and was nice. I sat there and waited for the dentist to come and look at my xrays before he could clean. I waited for awhile and then sat up to look into the office to watch. I set another 5 min of watching before it was time to leave. I had a little break down and told the women I had to leave. I told the dentist the last time there was a reason why I had not been to the dentist in years. The lack of communication in this place is horrible. It feels very corporate and they want to help those paying more first. Both dental hygienist I have had this place where great. They need to work on their customers interaction. We have options to go to.</Review>

We are new to your dental office with two dental insurances, your front desk clerk Nicole was rude to my daughter and brother today.  There is no need to hustle us for payment when the dental work is covered at 100%.  Maybe we should consider taking our money to another clinic that treats people with respect.  You have competition down the street.  If you don’t take care of your Customers, someone else will.  Maybe Nicole needs to learn the basics of Customer Service.  It’s that simple!</text>

Felt I should share this visit with everyone. Had an appointment for a regular cleaning. Am a returning client. But for some reason, spent two hours here without getting my cleaning even though I asked how long it would take and was told 20-25 min. Maybe it was a busy day, but appointments should be scheduled according to the type of visit. Should of been in and out in half hour.</Review>

So apparently they are retaliating for my honest review of this office in murrieta ca. Or they charge you whatever they want and manipulate the numbers in their favor when unfavorably reviewed.< /Text>< response>

This place is an absolute scam. Do not put yourself or your teeth through this dental office. I was scheduled for wisdom teeth removal and was told the bone graphs were optional. Not until minutes before my procedure ,while I was sitting in the operating chair, I was told that I NEEDED the bone graphs ($430 per tooth plus tax) or the oral surgeon would not work on me. My total was $1,960 for a free procedure that was authorized by my insurance. No thank you!< /Text>

<text>EXTREMELY dissatisfied. Went in for a filling, ended up needing to be a root canal that wasn’t addressed for over a month. I went in every week for over a month complaining about pain and the dentist insisted it was because the filling was sitting too high. Went to urgent care and the ER for pain management to find out I have an infection in my tooth (left untreated for a month!). It took me coming in and bawling my eyes out in pain for them to really look at my countless X-rays to say I do need a root canal and then be told it will take 20 days for my insurance to approve it. Which could have been done more than a month ago, as in all the times I came in complaining about pain. I cannot believe the carelessness and because there is no such thing as telling insurance companies to hurry up, I will be going into 2 and a half months of waiting. Thinking of just paying out of pocket at this point, which I’m sure is something I can’t even afford. Also, they did an Open Mend (Med?) to help for the time being and now my tooth looks as if it is turning grey, and the pain is still as present as before I got it. If you go here and leave in pain, I suggest demanding them to look further into it. This is simply ridiculous.<//text><rating>2</rating>< userid>

<Review>Dr. Kirk Hobock is very dishonest with procedures and a scam artist like most dentists. The staff, Hygienist and X-Ray technician are great! But the Dentist the meat of their operation doesn't want to do 2 fillings that is on the side near the gum line. It falls out once a year everything for them is crown's not when the teeth are in great shape just needed a night guard but won't redo their screw ups. If it wasn't for their staff this would be a 1 star rating.  Night guard they want $400, but in the pharmacy is $25 and $2000 for 2 good teeth with no discomfort to ruin. Every 6 months had dental cleanings now says all of a sudden it's only once a year? I'm done don't like white collar criminals<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I LOVE this office. The Dentist is so nice and has a gentle hand. I had a root canal AND a new crown and it was basically painless. I barely felt the shot. He's funny too :-)

His staff is AMAZING also. Very sweet and friendly.

This is by far the best dental place I've been to.  Dr. Silva is amazing when it comes to her patients. This was the second time Ive been here for a check up and cleaning and Dr. Silva is very thorough with her work and she will not let you walk out of the office until she gets everything off to make your teeth perfect. She is by far my favorite dental doctor. 😊< /text>

Dr. Hoback (I think that’s how you spell it,lol) is an amazing man, aside from being an awesome doctor. He made me feel totally at ease and my extraction procedure was flawless. Virtually no pain. Even his assistant was awesome. Couldn’t imagine going anywhere else for my dental needs. He was even patient with my Aunt’s rapid fire questions lol.</text>

The dentist is always trying to do his best to figure out ways to help you with your dental needs that will work for your budget as it seems his first priority is to help his patients. Highly recommend this location and not the one off Winchester very rude dentist over there who seens to only look out for his wallet.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Would give 0 stars if possible. Came here because my insurance changed. They told me I had multiple cavities and needed two crowns. I went back to my regular dentist for a 2nd opinion and was told I had no cavities and didn't need any crowns.

They also didn't clean my teeth very well and took like 20 x-rays of my teeth. My regular dentist takes 5-6 max. The dentist scraped my teeth for a minute after lying about my "needed" work, the assistant cleaned my teeth, and then she flossed my teeth. I can and do floss my own teeth so I'm not sure what that's about. If that's what they consider a full prophy, it's a joke.< /Text>

Was so nervous because I have neglected my teeth. Dr. Hobock was amazing and walked me through my problems. I hate sitting in "that" chair but my anxiety was low due to his kind nature. The girls at the front desk are so friendly and helpful.</Review>

I have had a paralyzing fear of visiting a dentist for my entire life! I visited Bright Now out of absolute need and I was terrified, but I was quickly put at ease by everyone; including the dentist! I have ongoing issues and have been many times this past year and I doing have an trepidation about going!<//text>

<Review>If I could give negative stars I would. My experience was the worst ive had at any dentist. I went in to get my tooth looked at because it felt like I had a cavity, that was hurting pretty had. After waiting almost an hour after my appointment time, they take me to get an xray. Take me to the chair where I sat again for about an hour. The dentist finally comes in, gets a piece of cotton, has me bite down on it and asked me if it hurt. I said "A little bit" He then said "looks like you need a root canal". It didnt sit well with me at all. The lady comes in to say its going to take awhile for your insurance to approve it. If not it will cost a couple thousand...Umm ok..I'm a 25 year old mother of 2.No way I could afford that. I went to get a second opinion.Come to find out I DONT need a root canal. It blew my mind! What if I did have the money to pay to get it done, what if my insurance came back the next day to approve it? I would have got a root canal that I never needed! They seem very unprofessional and either need to go back to school to learn more about dental work or they need to get replaced with a dentist that knows what their doing. Very unsatisfied. Always get a second opinion. Alot of dentists just want to steal your money.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>This office is extraordinary! I've been coming here for years -  they've never tried to sell me on treatments and my appointments are never delayed. They're very kind to their patients. I had an appointment today and had my 4 month old. The front desk remembered her name from when I was still pregnant my last visit in august! She started to fuss and cry and the hygienist was very understanding. The front desk actually came back and took her and held her and rocked her until I was done. It was amazing!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Let me start by saying, to find an honest and compassionate dental office whose 1st priority is patient care is a rare find! Bright Now is it! I needed a lot of work done and Dr. Hobock was AMAZING!! He just had such an great energy and makes you feel so comfortable! All the dental assistants and front staff are so accomodating and kind as well! Because I was so blown away with how smoothly everything went, I brought both my husband and 4yr old there as well. Dr Yavari saw my daughter and did a procedure on her. She blew me away! So professional, yet kind with a very genuine demeanor. The surgical nurse Donna also went above and beyond to make my daughter feel comfortable, it truly touched my heart! She helped make our experience the best it could possibly be! A few hours after the procedure Dr. Yavari called to check up on my daughter and see how she was doing! You can tell she is passionate about her work because it shows! Through multiple visits, from beginning to end my family has been beyond satisfied! I cannot thank you all enough!! ❤< /review>

I loathe going to the dentist. I always feel like even with insurance it is such a rip off. My husband went here with a dental emergency and they got him in that day. My 2 young daughters went and although they wanted nothing to do with cleaning they were still able to let the dentist check and count teeth. I was the last to go for a full work up.. x-rays, cleaving, etc. Quick and painless. Still a bit pricey for the antibiotics to get the gum disese controlled... That insurance does not cover, but a great dentist and we will continue to go like we're supposed too :)<//Review>

First of all,  I'm not one that comes to the dentist I just don't like to because I have had bad experiences in the past. Sencond,  my last visit to a dentist was maybe 10+ yrs.  I knew that it was time to go in and get it taken care of since I had a filling that came out and I had unbearable pain.  Third, I had no insurance to cover my cost!  The process was easy the personnel took me step by step and figured out how I can handle my situation,  I definitely needed guidance on how to make things work. The  Doctor was gentle but his assistant was the icing on the cake.  Besides of being kind he was reassuring and professional.  Instead of getting overwhelmed and extremely nervous his positive manner helped me calm down.  The only thing that I would recommend on my end is lower prices.< /Text>

<review>I visited the Murrieta office to obtain estimates on some major work that was needed.  Dr. Halterman was the dentist and was VERY professional.  We discussed the multiple options for the work and he gave me both pros and cons.  Afterward, Mallery provided me with detailed quotes on the 3 options and fully answered any questions I had, as did Dr. Halterman.  I thought  prices were far better than any I had received previously from other offices.  Highly recommended.</review><gmapID>0x80dc825b3be930ff:0xfee973ebbed3f45c</gmapID>< Pictures>

The ortho team on the other hand if you guys are looking for a handsome ortho I HIGHLY recommend this place ! He's the reason why I didn't care to go every month & didn't care how long I had them on for as long as I saw him I was happy !</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Very pleasant visit! Everyone in the office was nice and welcoming. My dentist is funny and he made sure I was comfortable during my procedure. I visited the office in Temecula and I didn't get the same feeling and welcome like the Murrieta office.<//Review>

<review>his office is a great place to go if you want to give away your money. After spending thousands of dollars at this office I opted to have a skin graft. The office told me it would cost $3,000. Once they ran my credit I was approved for $2,000 in care credit they told me the procedure would be $2,000. I have since learned that is the price of bone graft with implant needed. Not what I needed. I met a new dentist at this office for my skin graft who didn't have much to say but the work I had done there previously is what I had asked for so I trusted them. The dentist worked on the wrong tooth and the tooth he was supposed to work on is now worse. After going round and round trying to speak with a manager they told me I consented to the work and they could not do anything. My consent was for the tooth they have now made worse. I also sent my friend in who they told needed a $700 deep cleaning. She had been to different dentist office 8 months prior and did not need a deep cleaning. She went for a second opinion and still did not need a deep cleaning. Had they just made it right I would have continued to go there even thought the prices are clearly insane. Now I have to deal with the BBB and the board of dentistry.< /review>< pics>

I switched to this office from the Costa Mesa location since we moved here in Murrieta.  My daughters have braces and originally got them from the Costa Mesa office.  Off the bat, the dentists/orthos here at the Murrieta office gave us way more answers and were far more detailed than the other office we have been going to for the last two years.  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  Also, I had a very horrible toothache a few days ago.  I was so scared to go to the offfice since I’ve never been fond of going to the dentist.  But Dr. Halterman was amazing!  He made me feel so much better, relieved my pain and I was very comfortable.  I’m so happy I went in because it made me so much more comfortable going to the dentist and taking care of my teeth .</Text>

What a great experience. I've been super impressed with everyone at BNDental. My kids love them and now that I have converted to Brite Now, I am thrilled and feel like I am in great hands. Professionalism and preventative care from expert caring people feels awesome.  I historically hate the dentist, but I am excited to get back and visit Brite Now! Dental.< /review>

< Review>
The office was clean and the staff was friendly and professional. My problem is with the female Dentist, this was my first visit with her, second visit with this office. On my first ever visit to this office I had chipped my front teeth and the male Dentist had filed them down and made them look good. On my second visit I was given a female Dentist who within seconds of examining launches into trying to sell me veneers. I politely tell her 'no thank you' but she keeps asking and making faces suggesting that I really need them. I am a 26 yr old female with great teeth and when I say no the first time that should end the conversation. I was made to feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. I will not be going here again, they do not deserve my insurance or co-pay money. This woman is just trying to make money and does not care about treating her patients right and providing a comfortable non-judging environment.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I was treated like a King!  Elisa, Joycie and Nicole are the individuals who stood out.
When I walked into the door they called me by name and welcomed me in like they knew me!
Actually, they remembered me from last year and it was a very good appointment.
I needed a crown and I commented to the doctor (Dunya Antwan DDS) who was doing the work that she was better than my former Male dentist because she seemed to be more caring like a lady often times can be.  When I cringed because I thought it was gonna hurt she stopped and said,  "Are you okay?"  When she was done and hit the street, she said goodbye to me in the parking lot!  They really where friendly and it was the end of a Monday which is tough for them to stay in character to the end but they all did!
The assistant who especially stood out during this crown experience was Joanne.  Joanne stuck by my side through the hardest part of the crown experience and explaining everything to me and doing all the hardest clean-up work like all that spittle and such.
Elisa was especially good at the financing of the crown by cutting my payments into 4 equal parts.  I was very well pleased with them all and the tooth is now gonna last me many more moons I expect!
Also, Nicole was one of the three ladies who welcomed me into the office.  The first impression that they gave me was great and the flow of the entire crown experience was good because of it.
Thanks ladies!
I especially thanked Elisa for using my name when I first walked in and I also mentioned to her why it made me feel welcomed.
I hope I got everyone's name right because I tried to make a note of it however, my notes sometimes get mixed up but according to the notes I took there where the 5 gals named Elisa, Joycie, Joanne, Nicole and Dunya that made the experience a memorable one to say the least and I would recommend this business because of it!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This place has five star food, in a nice quaint decent size building. Everything is made with fresh ingredients that I can tell, and the utmost love/pride gets put into the food. The owner Jacob is very active in the community and even helped senior citizens obtain supplies during the lockdowns of 2020. While I often get the station Burger because I am a meat and potatoes kind of guy, the sushi and several other fish your face Foods is beloved by my girlfriend and several friends. If the brisket is available I highly recommend it.</Review>

We were hoping for breakfast but lunch salad was exactly what I wanted. Great place to stop and enjoy the great food. The lamb is exceptional. Outgoddamnstanding.  The chef picked fresh herbs for my salad.  Unbelievable. Do not pass this place up. It will leave a hole in your life.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJgINgeXhYyjEL4OTUacE4FZletxPbomJt_y0d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOln6HSS-InfRZZ3xMViPkRdFQwyudjtawBXzTA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUB4RPxA3DGb0vFwrokp94cpl_E9aOZx7tP9yy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAlO5YCp5yjcX78Zk5e1T7OksWrM1m_jm472eV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx3Zvwd1yt12NU8kizNoLg0czzOlPTKDfPmEou=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH-99cUlcAiG8JG_JNtSuLCafX1LjCFkJ7MsvL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXs38b-y-EF0dMGelMQIBedXN6yk_tkh6zNabQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Incredible burger, fries, beans and cornbread! Savory, hardy beans with huge chunks of smoked pork with jalapeno cornbread. His burger was enormous with all the fixings. The horseradish infused mayo has just the right amount of bite. Fried were spot on. Only open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, so plan ahead!!<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We stayed at the hotel next door, which did not have coffee makers in the rooms. As soon as the Brownsville Station Cafe opened (lunch) I went to see if they had coffee. They had coffee by the cup, but also sold by the bag [my dad had his camper and that has a coffee maker, however he only has decaf ;) ]. I bought a bag and the woman gave me a little to-go ramekin of cream. So nice!!!
We then went back for supper (to-go because of the silly virus restrictions) - I had ribeye steak and my friend had the chicken fried steak. Both were excellent. We will definitely be coming back here again when we are in the are! Thanks!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Just went there for lunch. Wide selection of international dishes, lamb, etc... My great hamburger was handmade, my husband's lamb dish delicious! So was the tomato basil soup! Truly a great culinary experience, food presented well (loved the very thinly cut tomatoes and onions). Very nice waitress! Place very clean. Addendum: I mistakenly wrote this review for Bob and Jim's Breakfast Burgers, and the honest owner replied we hadn't eaten there. However, they are very good also!

Unique! (No breakfast menu currently, though.) Handcrafted lunches and dinners in updated mountain atmosphere.
Excellent food and service!</review>

<review>My roommate and I have had lunch and dinner here several times, and it's always been fantastic. He's a vegan and there aren't really any options on the dinner menu for him. Jacob offers a great Boca Burger for lunch, and I've heard it may be held over for dinner, so cross your fingers. The service is always exceptional, and there's never a wait. I urge everyone to try a dessert because every one I've sampled has been amazing! Well done Jacob and staff!!< /review><date>1557008689875<//date>< user>

Everything I've tried is delicious.  I would recommend  this place to anyone.
For being so far out in the country it's well worth the  taking  the ride in the country and  stopping by to have a meal.  You wont regret it. It's a clean place with great staff.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

We were a party of 8 and all thrilled with our dinner. All but 1 had the special....lamb with scallops and coleslaw on a bed of potato pancake. We initially thought it an odd combination but once served, we relished the flavors and combinations. Absolutely delicious. Then....the handmade desserts! We sampled all and could not decide the best as each had a different favorite. The chocolate, the cheesecake, the bread pudding.....
Also important to note, the waitress was great, even when a party of over 20 arrived. We will be back and encourage others to give it a try. While the atmosphere is basic, the food is exceptional. My husband is hopeful they will add additional wine selection in the future.</Text>

<Text>Took my little family in and we all loved what we got, the kids included and they're a tough crowd to please. I had a gyro and sweet potato fries it was SO yummy! I'm so glad we have this place to choose from now and we'll definitely be regulars there the quality is beyond expectation and the prices are great for the portion sizes. The staff was also very accommodating when I requested something on my gyro be changed. Can't wait to try breakfast and dinner there.< /Text><Name>Wifey Pie</Name>< GmapID>

The burger was well cooked they used a sauce with horseradish which I enjoyed. I was scared when I saw that they used ciabatta bread as the bun but it was delicious, not chewy like it can sometimes be.
The decor and ambiance is lacking. But in this town I am overjoyed to have good food!!!!
As I mentioned they are new, I think it will only get better with time.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

It also comes with a dinner salad that was packed full of tomatoes, onions, lettuce, spinach, and your selection of dressing. I had ranch dressing on my salad and would of liked more dressing. The salad the server makes it up and brings it to your table. They also had some wonderful desserts as I had a wine looking glass of strawberries, lots of whip cream and cherry on top. The service was friendly, and polite. The place was new looking and very clean even the bathrooms. Dinner prices ran between $11 dollars to $19 dollars. It's in a country setting with the walls loaded with pictures of history. Great place.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>The cook that night wasn't a very good cook, our chess burgers were burnt around out side edges, the whole inside of hamburger was completely raw when we asked for them to be well done but not burnt. That means commen since you have to keep flipping the hamburgers over and over so they cook completely through and through, not burnt. We couldn't even eat our dinner, we just took our take out dinners home threw them away after spending that much money. Not happy at all will not be going back, I do hope they do better and good luck to them.< /Text>< Rate>

I have ate at the Brownsville Station on several occasions. I think the prices are too high for the product. Even with it being a little pricey, I am partial to the artichoke dip that they  serve with veggies and pita bread, which I usually subsitute with a regular toasted roll instead of the pita bread. Its a clean establishment with clean restrooms. In addition they have free wi-fi service along  with cell service. The waiters are pleasant and very courteous. Service is quick and,efficient.<//review>

< review>
I have eaten at nearly every restraunt in oroville and surrounding areas. Over all the places to eat. This is the place I choose to go, and probally allways will. Service couldnt be better, and the same goes for the food. I'm from San Diego were I have experienced a flurry of foods, and I havent had anything like it. Every menu item is bomb. No matter what you get its fresher then fresh. Sometimes I even eat there twice in one day. I dont know what my life would be with it. Worth the drive, although for me its the same distance into town as it is to the station, although I could see myself driving a couple hours to eat here. I allways eat myself to the point of no more, and the bill is allways cheaper then any other restraunt I would go to achieve this. its crazy how much better real food is then all the proccessed stuff these restraunts pump out. Recomended to everyone everywhere. Max stars. Again bomb.< /review>

<review>Honestly it really sucked after several park-goers had entered we were all told we had to leave until 7:30 when on their website it says that their hours will vary during Memorial holiday with the gate wide open everybody assumed they were open already but we're told to pick up all are stuff and get back in line. If they would have simply did their job closimg that gate nobody would have been driving in?</review>< Pics>

This course is clean, inviting, and challenging!! They recently filled the lake with fresh water for RCing, fishing and canoeing. Resonable parking charge ($8) and plenty to do! Come on down!!</Text>

We remodeled our master bathroom this past summer and decided to try and use a local company to help us select our fixtures. Carrie was very helpful and informative. We were worried it would cost a lot more than online, but she gave us comparable prices to those we found online.

Unfortunately after using our bathtub only 3 times, the water wouldn’t turn off. After paying a plumber to come take it apart, we discovered the valve cartridge was broken. There is no way is could be from wear and tear.  We appreciate Robert working with us to get that replaced.  It’s very frustrating to buy something so expensive and have it break with little use. So I would give delta a 1 star for that.< /text>

We were ushered in and made to feel welcome.  We told the lady helping us our price range and she said she would be able to work with us.  We picked out “THE” perfect bathroom and tub faucets for the perfect sinks we found there.  However, when the bath tub faucet came it was different I called her and told her my concern that the faucet looked different than the one we picked out. I never received a return call – that should have been the huge bell that warned me.  When our sink faucets were installed we weren’t home and yes you guessed it they were wrong too.  When my husband went to the show room to talk to the lady who helped us she told us that we were mistaken that they never had a faucet that looked like what we said we had picked out and then she laughed.
Yes, laughed right in my husbands face. Very Professional !?!  When one pays TOP dollar (oh yeah they are NOT inexpensive) one would expect better treatment and accurate ordering.  Do yourself a favor and don’t go here.  We found the same sinks at IKA for half the price and faucets at one of the local home improvement stores that were the same, same brand and less than half the price.  You may think the “personal” service is worth it but trust me it doesn’t mean a thing to them. I truly believe all they see is $ dollar $ signs.< /text>

Less than two years ago we purchased a Moen faucet for our kitchen sick, The hose that allows you to spray the sink developed a leak spraying water everywhere. My wife went to the store to try to get a hose kit for the repair. Steve told her she would have to deal with Moen directly. Many years ago I had a similar issue with a Moen and the retailing dealer I bought it from ordered the parts for me to fix it, and was very helpful. Moen has a great warranty but Steve at Ferguson, the dealer that sold it to me, wanted nothing to do with it?  Very poor customer service after the sale is made. There are plenty of dealers for Moen products, I will be going elsewhere in the future.</Review>

Trader Joe's has become my favorite place to buy groceries since I moved to the States.
The quality of their products is amazing and the service provided by all their employees is above and beyond.
I like that they have a nice variety of products but not that many that makes the shopping experience overwhelming.
They have tons of local wine and beers at really good and cheap prices.
They also sell products from around the world, which improves the shopping experience.
I would say most of their products are cheaper and better quality than stores like Walmart or Safeway.<//Text>

<review>This was a first time visit for me at this location. Only stopped in b/c it was conveniently located near the freeway and in the direction of my home. Went  looking for nutmeg (Trader Joe's only carries it during the holidays) and 365 chickenless nuggets. There was an older guy on the floor too busy having a personal call on his Bluetooth to really be bothered. He sent me to the wrong isle. Fortunately there was another man (maybe manager?) that assisted me in locating the items. He immediately turned the negative experience into a positive one. That quick turn around is the only reason why I may return in the future.< /review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

Store was fine but I need the cashier to use more critical thinking skills. I get the no bagging policy, but telling me, without a cart, that I can't put my items back into the bag I took them out of, doesn't make any sense. Blindly following rules is not a great customer service experience 🙃< /Review>

A great shopping experience before I got in line, but the "bag your groceries outside on these tables" thing is a bit much. Because I brought my own clean washed canvas bags, I had to watch the cashier take out each item from my packed cart, scan it, then place it back into my cart so I could then take it all outside to bag it. Took a long time. There has to be a better way.</text>

Staff is very friendly and I can always find what I want!

My only issue is that they stopped stocking soy milk, which I have to buy in Safeway now. Otherwise they are perfect.< /review>

Long line to get in, due to shutdown, but they try to keep it moving. Doing a lot of restocking. Most employees were very nice/helpful but there were several women shoppers who seemed a little aggressive, with their shopping carts & they weren't together.  Not sure what that was all about.<//text>

The cashiers are all very friendly and accommodating. I can now bring my own bags, and they have tables outdoors where you can do your own bagging in a socially distant manner. The waiting line outside is also pleasant because they have nice team members offering bottled water (on heatwave days) and offering you sanitized shopping carts before you go in.< /Review>

It's still the cleanest, most positive place to shop. Although I don't get everything there, it's where I go to cheer up and get really special items.   My daughters stock up on fast, healthy, frozen meals for the dorm!</text>

Ok! I went to this Trader Joe's for the first time. I was in my nursing apparel and had my badge in hand. I simply wanted to stop by and grab a few items after working a long depressing shift. I presented my badge to the gentleman at the door and he tells me that they are no longer allowing essential workers to enter the store and we are to wait as well. Now I normally shop at the Trader Joe's in Fremont but I relocated to Oakland. Now Healthcare workers don't ask for much and I literally ook that as a Slap in the face. I know that ever RN and physician is incredibly pressed for time because we are all working extremely long, exhausting, and chaotic hours. Now you mean to tell me when we get off we have to stand in line 20 - 30 min. before we can go into a store to make some much needed grocery. I declare this was the 1st and last time that I will ever shop at this Trader Joe's. If I was not so tired and depressed about all the patients that I see dying from CVD everyday, I would have left this store without shopping at all. Plus I just wanted to grab a few things to take to work so that I could have something to eat. This World Truly Have Issues especially when you take a simple gesture and discard during such chaotic times!!!< /review>

As expected, the store holds treasures galore with a good produce section and a nice cheese selection. The store is on the smaller size so it feels crowded and the frozen foods section is adequate.

<review>TJs is one of my favs due to the variety of special items in stock that you can't find at other stores. I also ❣️ the prices that don't fluctuate often. The people are always helpful and cool. It's also nice to see the same friendly faces. I ❤️ the pesto sauce, limeade, chocolate crispy  bars, scallion pancakes and roasted garlic & onion pistachios. 👍🏾🙋🏾‍♀️<//review>< Pics>

During this time of Pandemic, Trader Joe's does everything to make their customers feel safe. I got a free bottle of water while waiting in line and a complimentary can of sweet treats on my way out. I love this store!</Text>

Both the Indian and Italian dinners are very good.  Many helpful folks to answer questions and even take you to the spot.  This store is clean well stocked.<//review><username>Sally McKinney</username>< user_id>

The staff is UNBELIEVABLY friendly! I come here strictly for the Mac N Cheese! Too good to pass up, can't find it anywhere else. Love the options that they have for food and drinks, a lot of it is unique to trader Joe's. A little far away for groceries for me but always worth it!<//review>

<Text>It's Trader Joe's. Not much to say except they are amazing. The best customer service. Good food, good prices. Fresh produce and salads.
I love everything about Trader Joe's. It can get busy on the weekends but nothing compared to other locations. I like the layout of this store the most. I wished it stayed open until 9:30pm but it is Alameda after all, everything closes early.

Keep up the good work Trader Joe's!

I like their fast checkout and managers are always there to help!</Text>< Date>

Finding products can be haphazard at best. Workers are overworked  and rarely smile. Regardless business continues to be busy, avoid the 5 pm and weekend rush, it's stupid crazy.

<review>Excellent selections of foodstuffs not available in other stores at affordable prices. The Alameda South Shore Center location thoughtfully widened its aisles by moving large produce stands outdoors, which allows the shoppers to keep safe distances and significantly reduces social distancing anxiety!<//review>< userid>

Its nice to go in and choose a snack thats prepares on the shelves and beverages coupled with fresh fruit/veg. not prepared. Yes, I am learning other cultures want fresh fruit over prepared.</Review>

Grew to love this chain supermarket. Although not many selections, but what have on shelves are enticing and healthy. Prices are all very reasonable. On top of that, every single staff members are friendly and extremely helpful. Loved the free tasting treats and hot coffee! Good job! After so many great experiences, I Stopped going to Safeway!</Text>

Minimalist shopping. They have lost everything you'll need, and usually only a select number of that individual item.  They don't have 24 varieties of XYZ, so you don't waste your time deciding.  Hot coffee and samples are usually ready.  If you don't know where something is, ask one of three friendly Traders and they'll guide you! My favorite place to shop for birthdays and such, cuz everybody needs whimsical food items and orchids.</review>

Don't find very much out of place ever.  Just when you find an item that you like it either gets discontinued or is labeled a "seasonal item" and you never see it again. The layout is always changing so and currently the bread location makes no sense. Staff is super chill and always friendly. Wish they didn't use so much plastic in their packaging. .< /review><Response>None</Response></record>

< Review>
A fairly decent sized store that isn't all over packed and tight to navigate thru like some other locations are. The crew is always pleasant. They also offer samples everyday of one or more of their products, which can be a helpful way to find something new you'll like that you couldn't afford to take a chance on buying. Personally, I also love that they help keep our local food bank stocked with all kinds of different items. I am also a client and lucky enough to benefit from their offerings, however, I find their pricing to be quite competitive overall but when it comes to the staples like milk, butter and eggs its hard to find a better deal than Trader Joe's everyday prices.<//Review>

There are almost always things on my grocery list I need to go next door to Safeway to get, but this Trader Joe's location has better prices on many items, always pretty well stocked, clean, and appropriately staffed so you're not waiting on line very long, even during rush hour. Staff has always been friendly and helpful.</Text>

Good food that is healthy and not too expensive. Organic food and a sample as well as restrooms are available to everyone. Carolina works with the samples and is very nice. She will explain the recipe and the ingredients and is quick with a smile. Thank you, Carolina.</text>

High rating of course, it's a Trader Joe's. This one is larger than many I've been to and can be very so crowded. However, they are prepared with express lanes for not just 15 and less but 5 and less or something crazy and a line for those without any cart or basket (or is it just a basket?) No matter which lane you're in, the staff here is extra friendly and helpful.</Text>

Favorite place to go for groceries!

Parking: Shares a parking lot with the other stores at the Alameda Shore Center.

Prices: It's not a dollar store, but I think they are pretty decent and worth it. It's definitely cheaper than Whole Foods if that helps you get a better idea of the prices they offer.

The food: Many options. They have organic, gluten free, and vegan options too.

Tip: Please bring a bag to put your groceries in or you will be paying for a grocery bag. California laws, and a good one because we care about the environment.

Will I go again: Yes<//text>

Like any Trader Joe’s, you get good prices, quick service but a crazy parking lot full of inconsiderate people so beware that aspect. The staff are always to helpful and consistently reliable even in super busy times. We had such a great experience with our cashier. He offered to go get a dip for these chips we were purchasing that we were discussing and saw my obvious regret in not getting it. He had a line and still put our needs first and that really means something to us. Me and my hubby don’t shop anywhere else! I wish the parking lot ran on the same efficiency as the store itself lol< /Text>

This is the best grocery store! They have everything​ you can imagine and some more. They favor fair trade and have lots of organic products. And added to all of this, they are cheaper than any big bad chain of supermarkets. You won't find any big brand .stuff there, which, in my opinion is great!< /review>

Trader Joe's Gluten Free Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip cookies

I just want to thank you for your gluten free Chocolate Chip Cookies. They are amazing and unlike many gluten free products, they don't have a lingering funky after taste. They are awesome! Thank you!!

<Review>This is by far the most congested TJ's I've ever encountered.  Often you have to circle the parking lot for 15 to 20 minutes just to find a space.  Once inside you will wait in line to check out for a minimum of 20 min.  Shopping is like a game of dodge ball.  You cant take your time to browse the shelves because someone wants to squeeze by with thier cart.  If you have options dont shop here!</Review><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Text>Alway friendly staff and stock always nicely kept and stocked. Love how the offer tasting so we can try what goodie they offer....Cause sometimes we buy stuff and we don't like the taste. This allows us to know what is good and what not. However I would highly recommend to write the price tag bigger like apple or fruits is for one not per pound. I noticed a few times new shoppers picking up fruits that is priced each, thinking it's per pound.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Need to have checkers IN the express lane if limiting TWO lanes to "baskets only"!! NO ONE THINKS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES!! Did it EVER occur to folks that some people NEED TO USE THE CARTS FOR DISABILITY PURPOSES?!?! We shouldn't be relegated to the motorized chair in order to avoid standing in long lines for a small amount of items! But THAT'S what happens when the "express" lane isn't staffed AND one needs to push a cart to safely walk/stand up!!</text>

I have only lowered the stars due to the abundance of pre packed produce. I had not noticed that before. The produce ferments/rots and molds faster when packaged/bags. Plus, I still need a Safeway run to get mainstream items. The organic, grass fed poultry and meats rock. The snacks are on point too.</review>

It's a gem of a store which cohabits peacefully next to Safeways. Always a good selection of wines and cheeses to buy (the two most important aspects of life).</Review>

< Review>
OMG, this is my local Trader Joe's, which I visit on average five times a week, and somehow I've never reviewed it? How's that possible? Argh!

Trader Joe's store #109 is located in the middle of the South Shore Shopping Center. There's hundreds of parking spots immediately out front. Conveniently located near the corner of Park Street and Otis Drive, this is the to-go spot for dozens of staples, some keto-friendly foods (including grilled artichoke hearts, cheeses, eggs, hamburger, pork tenderloin, turkey breast, and sopressata salami), and the many TJ-specific offerings (including truffle pâte, many really good coffee beans, and seasonal surprises like unsweetened bakers chocolate, cakes and cookies, and mystery bags).

The non-food items, like greeting cards, plants and flowers, and a wide selection of beer, wine, and hard liquors round out any shopping trip.

The staff are absolutely wonderful, know their stock and where they may be found, and are always ready to help you find a TJ treasure. I'm very proud of my local store and hope you come on over to share in the joy.</Review>

<Time>1494014739732<//Time><Rate>4<//Rate><text>Our go-to store. We come here weekly, because they have a good selection of veggies, fruits, meats, cheeses, snacks, beers and wines. Not to mention the staff is really friendly and the store is well kept (compared to Safeway next door where things are all over the place).

It's not pricey and it's convenient since you have a big parking place and many other stores around (in case you can't get everything here). Sometimes they don't have certain things cause they are changing the labels or getting in something new from someone else, but if you ask they might find something in the back or just tell you the date when they're getting it back on their shelves.

The only downside is that perishable things tend to go bad before their expiration date (salads and fruit I'm looking at you) and we do put them in the fridge and take all the necessary precautions.

The lines are not too long because the staff makes sure there's a sufficient number of check-outs open (again compared to Safeway where you have two registers and 20 people). But if you want to avoid the place being too crowded come in right after they open.

I don't care much for the samples they have, but I was told they are also good.

Would highly recommend you to come here instead of going into Safeway next door.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Trader Joe's is the Cat's Bee's Knee's Meow.
Everything with their name on it is delicious or an excellent bottle of booze.
Just stay away from their hippie toilet paper.   That stuff is sandpaper for your butthole.    I feel incredibly fortunate to live so close to their shop.< /review>

I've been shopping at this Trader Joe's for the last 15 years. Well maintained and well stocked store that consistently provides above average customer service. Unlike some other TJ's in the Bay Area, there's ample parking and more importantly, enough elbow space.</Text>

<review>Good place to pop in and grab a snack, and they have great flowers. However, I'm usually really disappointed in their selection- all the salads but one have meat, so as a vegetarian I'm pretty limited. Also, a lot of the food in the freezer section have modified food starch or msg in them. I'm not at all a health food freak but I do like the minimum amount of additives/artificial crap in my food so it's disappointing when all the tasty looking things are full of nasty stuff. I will say that the staff is very nice and always helps you out if they can. On the whole, I think I'll stick with Safeway but sometimes you really want a Southwest salad<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

One of the best places to shop around. Very good managment. Great prices and lots of yummy food. Their brand is not gmo free certified ( hence lower prices), but they claim that ingredients are GMO free. Some of the items are in a way same idea as popular not so healthy products just better ingredients. Lots of organic produce for  reasonable prices. I’ve  been shopping at TJ’s for so many  years and it still holds that same friendly service and affordable prices for healthy food.< /text>

I have  been shopping Trader Joes so long, few would remember it was only in the Concord  area and they had a cheese counter where they would cut it for you.  The furthest Trader Joes I visited was New York.  They have 2 stores side by side because  you can't buy liquor in the food store. Both were packed. All in all it's a great place to shop.< /text>

<Text>Great layout and brilliant being next to Safeway, the reminder of how great the service is at TJs. If there is a line at the checkout it means all checkers are open and working at full throttle. Whereas at slowway, there's always a line and 8 checkout stands are empty with no workers.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

they do a lot of private label stuff, but it is uniformly high quality and lower prices than the equivalent merchandise at safeway or whole foods. the selection is pretty reasonable, but they do not tend to have a lot of specialty products. for example, they have white, crimini, and portabella mushrooms, but no shiitakes.

the other thing they do is stock a smattering of intriguing products, often on a seasonal basis. examples include halumi cheese, Thai chili spiced almonds, and chocolate-covered ginger.<//text><user_id>101457460921343625921<//user_id><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>Maybe it's me, but there only thing I really come here for is produce sometimes. They don't consistently carry a lot of the items I would expect them to have so it's always a hit or miss for me here.
Lines are usually long and move slow on just about every occasion I've come aside from 1 time.<//review>< rating>

<review>Friendly, friendly folks in the Lakeshorehood! I like their prepared meals with attention to minimizing salt in most. New things are seasonally introduced. I do wish they'd label the "lighter" hot spicy things but their return policy is great so not really an issue.</review>< userid>

(Translated by Google) After all it is Tzu.
Food made for autumn. The sweets are orange.
The taste is also excellent.
Food served according to the season is excellent.
However, you have to wait about 7 minutes before entering.

(Original)
역시 트조입니다.
가을에 맞춰 만든 음식.과자들이 오랜지 색을 입었습니다.
맛 또한 일품입니다.
계절에 맞춰 나오는 음식들이 일품입니다.
그러나 역시 7분정도 기다렸다가 들어가야합니다.</text>
