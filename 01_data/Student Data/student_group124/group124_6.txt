I purchased specific itemized parts and upon checking the items in bag; there was one missing. Adan then apologized for not putting it in my bag and stated that he'd be back with it. Upon return, he then said that they were out of stock and referred me to another store 3mi away. I then asked him to call the store and verify that they had it. And if so, set it aside for me if possible. 🙏 . But I did get my military discount.  So, all in all, thanks for recognizing & acknowledging the Armed Forces. 🤗👍</review>

And then he encouraged me to complain to the manager into corporate office about it. who needs that type of experience when you have a busy life with so many problems happening left and right to have to have attitude when you're spending your hard-earned money?</Review>< response>

I prefer this location because they usually have no wait times and their staff are helpful and friendly. Lines at the parts desk are rare so you can get assistance and get your parts quickly.<//Review>

I have been a long time customer at O'Reilly and had an incident where they sold me a wrong cooling hose for my car and when I tried to return it they claimed I brought in wrong hose and that they didn't sell me that hose and to wait til guy that sold me part came in to talk to him. The manager was not help nor did he even acknowledge the issue.</Review>

<Date>1618769660498</Date><Rate>2< /Rate><text>The pictures you see online aren’t really how the motel looks. I saw three different rooms and ended up just picking the one with working ac. The covers are typical motel covers (not like the pictures online). There was a needle in my room( yes a needle that you get a shot with at the doctors) . The only good thing was there was a microwave in the room and working cable. The employees tell you different check out times. There’s a lot of activity at night, people walking pass your room all night . That was my experience, I didn’t expect too much from a 2 star motel but I wish the rooms were just like the pictures I saw online.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Was beyond shocked with how amazing the room was. Took us by surprise really because it looked as bad as the ones surrounding it. Was sure we were about to waste money on another ghetto trashy motel but it was the opposite and well worth it.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
This was a great place for the money, and it has been newly remodeled. The room was nice and it was moderately comfortable. The area around isnt great, but my boyfriend and I had no problems, and we felt safe. The motel could use a few more standard amenities like shampoo in the bathrooms and a real maid cart for the cleaning lady.I wouldnt really recommend staying here unless its only for a night or two just for a place to sleep and shower. It was fine for us for a one night stay.< /Review>

<text>I stayed at the Clover Motel several times during our ten day trip from Malta to Los Angeles, as we moved in and out of the city. I called up at reception on every occasion to reserve our rooms and found staff to be very friendly and flexible.
Our bed was all very comfortable and we slept very soundly!

If you are looking for luxury and brand new bathroom & lights, enough space for parking, this is the place for you that can come with budget. If you need a clean, comfortable, quiet place, this is it!!!

Overall, very pleased with our stays and glad to have found this spot. I would love to come here again. Highly recommended!!!<//text><resp>None< /resp>< time>

I came here not knowing what to expect, especially because I'm not from the area but I was impressed and satisfied. Staff was friendly and made me feel great about staying there. The rooms are nicely decorated and really cozy. They have a microwave, fridge, tv with cable included, and a neat bathroom. If you are looking for a place to stay I definitely recommend this place, you will want to go back because I know I will go back for sure.<//text>

<Review>I enjoy my stay. Super clean brand new rooms. Only it's area is little poor but it's not bother me and thats not hotel fault. Service is great. Rooms justify their price. Love being here every trip. Walmart just one blocks away and some food options are walking distance. Glass shower door, 40" flat screen with 140 chanels.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Had a great 3 nights stay, Hotel was good with basic amenities in the room and Wi-Fi facilities. Rooms are very hygienic, neat and clean. Good value for money. The hospitality shown to us by staff was outstanding.</Review>< user>

The owners are very nice. Very clean i loved the whole room inside and outside very clean the room looked like a Vegas room the bathroom was so nice. I live in pamldale and when i go to LA and i have to stay out their i will stay in this hotel again. Its not ghetto not loud very quite i took my kids with me to and its was good for my babies. I loved it and i recommend who ever goes to LA and be around lynwood and has to stay in a room i will recommend this one. All the other ones on long beach Blvd have too much prositute and too much going on.< /Text>

It cost as much as any of the motels down Long Beach Blvd. However this motel has remodeled rooms with a vety modern look. Tile floors, mosaic tile showers with full glass enclosed showers. The bathroom had a musty moist smell that didnt bother me becausen of how nice it looked.</review>

The people who ran the place are awesome. It just sucks that the place is in a bad area. The pictures do the place justice. Its nice and clean. The location makes you feel uncomfortable.</review>

Nice place but the town house motel is just as good if not better with better service and the don't raise there price to 90 +5 just because they have a lot of people booking or it's a weekend I don't recommend it town house next door 65$ everyday and perfect for my picky self clean comfortable and safe</Review>

<Review>We have been eating at Kabuki twice a week for 2 years now. We love the staff, the location, the laid back environment, and of course, the modest prices. Close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and it's guaranteed to be delicious. Great place to have a celebratory dinner and not be sweating bullets when the bill comes. This is 100% a local gem.<//Review>< pictures>

This place felt pretty average to me and it had some ups and downs.

The good: Good location right in downtown Petaluma. Reasonable prices, seemed like they have good lunch specials and happy hour specials and such. Relaxed atmosphere. Huge sushi menu and the sushi we had was pretty good.

The bad: Service was pretty slow and we had to remind staff what was in our sushi order. The non-sushi menu items we had were okay but not anything to write home about. I was especially excited about the curry and it was disappointing. The sauce was reasonably tasty but they only served a tiny little bit of it, not even enough to cover the meat let alone the rice.

All said, we were satisfied and I'd go there again. Can definitely recommend if you want something more convenient and good value and less fancy. But I'd probably recommend only ordering sushi.< /review>

Food was tasty, but most rolls came undone. Service was friendly but a touch slow.< /Text>

Yesterday was the first time in this restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the excellent service, with the finest  food and wine and with the modest price. We will definitely come back soon.<//review>

My favorite place for sushi in the bay area! Very fresh rolls, good happy hour discounts. I love and sushi places have both traditional rolls with fresh fish and the elaborated deep fried or baked saucy kinda roll.<//review>

Almost two weeks ago I met someone special and we shared our first meal here. It was a delightful, above-average dining experience on all counts. The sushi and tempura were delicious, the service no-nonsense, and the ambiance for the time of day (lunch on a Saturday in mid-autumn) was peaceful. It was the perfect setting to get comfortable for a 3+ hours long leisurely meal steeped in meaningful conversation. I'm certain I will be returning with her, since it's one of her favorite spots to eat in Petaluma. This was my first visit and I'm certain it won't be my last.</review>

<review>I would like to give this restaurant a higher rating because the sushi it was delicious but the service and presentation was not.  We went for a late lunch last week. Our server acted as if she was in a rush to do something else, and she didn't come back and check on us. We had to repeatedly track her down. If there had been a lot of other customers I could have understood that but there was only one other group there. It's disappointing because I've been here for dinner at other times and been pleased.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I would have loved to give this more stars, it had a great staff and location but the food was so below average. The tempura used was so gross and cheap. As pictured you can see it's the cheap mix you buy at any local market and overly watered down. Flavors were off and did not taste fresh. I honestly would not come here again especially since the prices were about average, when it had the taste of a cheap college town sushi shop. If you want good sushi try something else. If you want something relatively fast and just white california flavors, you can come here.</Review>

A general go-to sushi joint right downtown Petaluma. Although it's not overly Japanese fancy, it does have nice Nigiri and rolls.

The staff is friendly and the service is good.</review>

The entrees were absolutely inedible. We ate about 3 bites and pushed plates away. The rude waitress just asked "you done" she didn't ask why we did not eat our expensive meals and just dropped off the check. She must be related to the owners because this was some of the worst service ever experienced. My stomach started feeling bad shortly after.< /review>

The Weeknd was very tentative and apologized profusely when they realized that they had forgotten to you bring our beverages. I had the salmon teriyaki combination with chicken teriyaki and it was okay. Definitely hit the spot but hits on the more quantity over quality perspective. Regardless a good place to stop for a quick meal.<//Text>< Time>

Good sushi and ok Nigiri. A bit heavy on the rice but if that's your thing than B+. Fish was cut a bit novice style because I found a few chewy pieces of meat still attached to the Nigiri I ordered. Rice was a bit undercooked as well. Staff a bit unprofessional. I waited a solid 2 mins after seating myself before someone greeted me. Came during happy hour but place was deserted. A bit disconcerting for those looking for a place that looks welcoming. Also overpriced for the quality I received.< /review>

I don't get to eat out often, which made today's lunch even more disappointing. When I ordered crab nigiri, I received crab salad. I hate turning away food, so I ate it, but let them know they had made a mistake.They were apologetic, which is the only reason I am awarding 1 star. The other nigiri I ordered was tasteless, and the rice wasn't properly seasoned. I will not be returning.</Review>

<Text>Affordable + tasty.  I ordered Nabeyaki-Udon.
0x2be honest it didn't like Nabeyaki - Udon but rather an American version thereof.  But it tasted good and I liked it.  So the pluses here are:

- Tasty food
- Almost half the price of Gohan
- Nicer West-Side Petaluma Atmosphere<//Text>< time>

<text>I recently bought a 2018 Toyota Corolla from Addison at the Huntington Beach location.
I had a bad accident & totaled my 2007 Honda.
Initially my insurance paid for a rental & like every other time I’ve rented cars. EVERY OC location go over & beyond to insure satisfaction.
While driving a new rental with all kinds of safety features, I knew that was #1 priority.
Unfortunately I’ve been in multiple accidents.

Addison knew this, so he knew exactly which cars would keep me safe, & others on the road.
He was also extremely patient, knowledgeable, & truly cared about what was most important to me.

Well, yesterday my new car saved my life & a possible multi car piled up. In a moment of distraction my car starting beeping super loud, as I slammed on my brakes to not hit the stopped car in front of me. It was almost as scary as when I totaled the Honda.
Traffic collisions AND close calls are traumatic.

If I was in my  ‘07’ Honda my car would have become an accordion. It was older so it didn’t have safety features.

I highly recommend Addison & Kyle if your looking into buying. Enterprise maintains their cars which is an extra bonus & peace of mind.

Sincerely grateful,
Monica P</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This was my first time buying a car from a lot. Typically my family and I are firm believers in no car payments and buying used (really used) from a private person, outright in cash. After having too many cars on the fritz needing repair after repair, my husband and I were ready to ‘adult up’ and buy a newer car under warranty, to ease our anxiety of car troubles. Pay now, or pay later amirite?

All I have to say is that every associate and manager that we encountered at Enterprise was stellar! Their customer service, their non-pushy sales style, was exactly what we needed. They gave us time and space to make sure our decision was what we truly wanted, and put zero pressure on us to buy from them. They answered every question we had, were incredibly accommodating and it truly was haggle free, hassle free, and we were in and out in less than hour once we had finally come to our purchase decision.

This program of having barely used cars in immaculate condition is exactly what I needed. I wanted to feel like I was making a smart decision financially, but also getting a quality car that would last. Each car must go through an inspection process before being sold on the lot. Our Tucson is only a year old, with hardly any miles, and didn’t have a scratch on her. We are beyond elated with our new car and the entire experience of buying this car. From RJ and Erica showing us the cars and taking us for test drives, to Jason covering all paperwork quickly and efficiently. This was a breeze! I didn’t even have to make a physical trip into my bank, or the DMV! Thank you a million times. I will be back in a couple years when we are ready to purchase another car!

Also, thank you for the great trade in deal! That too took a lot of pressure of us and saved our valuable time to be better spent on driving our new car, rather than selling our junker!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I bought a Ford Mustang Convertible from here.   Great and friendly service.  Kyle De John helped me navigate the process and he is an excellent salesman.

The car was priced below KBB and is a great deal! Will definitely  recommend others.<//text>< Rate>

<Text>My husband and I just bought a beautiful RAM truck from Addison, at Enterprise car sales.  I can't say enough great things about Addison.  He was not pushy, but very respectful of what we needed and wanted.  He had us at "Hello" as his personality was so energetic and pleasant.  He went and picked up the truck for us from another location and the next day we bought it, and have been so happy.  Addison is the type of salesman every dealer ship should have.  We simply could not be happier....and it is because of him!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Kyle over at enterprise was a great help finding my car. He assisted me with options and finalized my decision with a awesome rate for first time buyer. He nailed every thing in terms of payment, interest, color, miles, style, and brand. He wasn't pushy and also gave me a great deal on my trade in. He was able to transport the color choice of the car in the same day. I had absolutely no anxiety  which is rare when buying a car. I highly recommend. I felt confident and safe the entire way. I love my new 2019 hyndai tucson< /text>

Enterprise Huntington Beach was such a pleasant experience from the first moment we walked in. We were greeted warmly and then Addison asked us a few questions about our preferences and then showed us four cars, one of which we bought.
The team worked together seamlessly.< /Text>

< Review>
My wife and I have visited Enterprise Car Sales (Long Beach branch) around 5PM on Saturday. Our sales representative Ramez patiently helped us evaluate the inventory on the lot and other branches (via online). Finally we have selected a vehicle which was at another branch and thought we will come back the following day to test drive it. Ramez has offered to personally bring the car for us to test drive the same day and w/o obligations. We went for dinner and less than two hours later we were back at the branch test driving the car, which we have decided to purchase. Thank to Andrey's (branch manager) swift and organized paperwork skills, we drove out of the lot in about an hour and well after the closing time. Sure, we were pre-approved by our bank, which has speed up the transaction, but pure dedication to customer service and going above and beyond by Andrey and Ramez is the reason why this is our third purchase from Enterprise Car Sales (same branch). Thank you for exceptional customer service.<//Review>

I have bought several cars here, and have always been delighted by the quality and the level of service.

I have also rented cars from them on several occasions in the past few months, and I am always knocked out by the excellent level of professionalism, attention to detail and service that each person at this location gives.<//Review>

< Review>
I feel confident that I received a fair deal on our Tesla and the staff was exemplary during our visit.  Enterprise is known for their customer service and the staff in Huntington Beach did not disappoint.  There is a mountain of paperwork but we moved through it pretty rapidly and they even picked up a knosh for us while we were waiting.  The only hard part with Enterprise Car Sales is that you have to pay to transport the vehicle before you get to see it in person so you are out the transfer fee before you get a face to face look at the car, especially the exterior paint.  As former rental cars for Enterprise you are purchasing the car "As Is," and there are little nicks and chips on the exterior paint from being a rental so that is hard to see on photos before you pay the transport fee.  After purchasing our vehicle, we had to have the exterior trunk repainted and that was a pretty good chunk that was not covered by Enterprise but we are still content with the deal we received.<//Review>

I bought a car from the Huntington Beach  location last month.  I thought I would share my experience hopefully helping others.

The GOOD:
-There are a nice selection of cars and if they don't have something they can get it in.  The cars are generally in good shape although based on reviews I guess bad ones get through sometimes.
-I'm pretty busy and they were very helpful in doing some things online or by phone to expedite things on the day I went in to buy the car I picked out online.
-The people were very nice, friendly, and hospitable. I would give specific shout outs were it not for the bad.
The BAD:
-My car had an undisclosed issue with a broken folding mirror. It just makes a grinding sound if you push the fold button. (I’ll live.)
-Do not expect anything from this dealership after the sale, absolutely nothing.  No response to emails, no callbacks.  Three weeks after the sale and four ignored emails to two different people. I call for a manager, and they take a message. I get assurances on the phone I'll get a call back that day...Nope.  As  I said, I'm busy. I'm not driving down there and I feel like if I did someone would conveniently be out to lunch or out sick. So if you are promised extra keys,or car mats, or anything, don't buy the car until you get them.  If you do buy the car accept that you will not get whatever was promised.  I read this on other reviews and just thought it was some bitter guy obsessed over some car mats. I ignored it. I should not have.  I guess they don't rely on repeat customers.  I'm not freaking out I didn't get my 400 dollar second bmw smart key.  I'm freaking out because this is how this "team" chooses to do business.  I loved my experience up until I drove off.

There are other Enterprise Car Sales locations and they can drive any car over to any location. It doesn’t have to be the one on Beach in Huntington Beach.  Think about using this service You have been warned. Good luck.<//text>

<review>I can’t recommend Enterprise Car Sales of Huntington Beach highly enough! Mike and Joanna were so helpful and honest. I even returned to ask Joanna to help me understand some of the phone/car connections. She sat in my car, and patiently explained to this Luddite how everything worked! I felt comfortable coming back because she was so kind from the very beginning! Mike answered all my questions and coordinated all details with Schools First Credit Union. What a team! Go there!!<//review>< pics>

<Text>I have nothing but great things to share about my experience with enterprise car sales in Huntington Beach! I was in an accident that totaled my car and definitely felt the stress and pressure of finding the next right car. Kyle with Car Sales was extremely helpful and went out of his way to find deals that I would like based on my preferences (color, mileage, make, etc). He was always available to discuss the options and made it easy for me! When it came to deciding on the car and moving forward with the purchasing process, he made me feel confident in my decision and made sure I understand the ins and outs of the vehicle. Kyle and his team do a phenomenal job - they genuinely care for their clients and passionate about what they do! I highly recommend working with them! I've been driving my newly purchased Mazda for a week now and it's been amazing!< /Text>< resp>

I recently purchased a Dodge Caravan at the Huntington Beach Enterprise Sales dealership and the process was very clear and enjoyable. Every aspect of the search and find process in locating an appropriate vehicle was overseen by Joanna, the representative I worked with. Generally speaking, her assistance and the environment within the dealership erased a majority of the fears and unknowns in purchasing a used vehicle. I highly recommend Joanna and the Enterprise Auto Sales dealership at in Huntington Beach, CA.<//Review>

Absolutely one of the best decisions I made. I was pre approved for an auto loan through my credit union which works with Enterprise. JD, Lucio and team were outstanding from the initial call of me inquiring about a vehicle through Enterprise and until the end of meeting with them. Overall the experience was amazing and fast. They were very informative, explained it to the T and gave me options. They never hustled me, harassed me or upselled anything. The best car buying experience ever and the team at Enterprise we're so professional and friendly.

I never knew about Enterprise and I would definitely recommend to friends and family.

Thank you to the Enterprise Team and thank you so much to JD and Lucio you guys sealed the deal.<//Review>

<text>Enterprise was very good with me in the sale and helping me purchase my car to replace my car that was recently totaled.  I was not happy with the car itself as I found 2 issues with my Nissan Altima where the front passenger window on occasion come off the the window track when you roll up the window, then I noticed my car was bottoming our more than usual when I drive over a speed bump forcing me to
be conscious about going over any speed but and when I have passenger it is more noticeable, the last thing is I have noticed that
my gas cap door has been in an opened position
and do not know who or how this would be caused by?

I may now have to take the car into the sharks
at the dealer to see if I can reduce these problems on my new car with only 45,000 miles.

Thanks,

Kenneth

P.S. I should have bought a newer car with no miles on it.<//text><user_id>112291470191447723219<//user_id><time>1572447706097< /time><resp>{'time': 1572526621355, 'text': "Kenny Mendoza, we appreciate your feedback and review and will happily pass this information onto our Huntington Beach Car Sales upper management team.

Joanna Ponce is a real asset. She was very pleasant and has a real easy to talk to personality. While she was pushing for the sale she also realized when to back off. Very honest with pointed questions. I was dealing with many different places to purchase a car and she got the sale because she listened to my needs. Answered questions based on the information that I gave her. Most car sales loose focus on what the customer is telling them. She got the sale because I trusted her not the best deal that somebody was really pushing on me. She is golden and I will be sending her my closest friends to her first.</text>

Seriously the best car buying car experience ever! Ryan and his managers we 100% professional every step of the way. I researched and compared CarMax, Ford Dealers, and the Costco auto program and without question got the best F150 for the best price and maybe even more importantly, with the best customer service. The people at CarMax were very nice but the price wasn't right. The people at Norm Reeves Ford were unbelievably mean and unprofessional. The process at Enterprise was smooth and relaxing. I am definitely coming back here in the future for my used car needs!<//Text>

<text>We had a great experience with Enterprise Car Sales.  We were referred by our credit union. We knew exactly what we were looking for, searched their inventory had the vehicle transferred.  Received an email and phone call from Erica who was very professional.  We made an appointment met with Lucio who explained the process. Within a week we were driving away in our vehicle.  If you are looking for a great team to assist with your next car purchase I definitely recommend this location.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

I had the pleasure of working with Mike Cuccia. He was very thorough & pleasant, really knew his stuff. Everyone at this dealership was very nice & attentive. So far, any issues I've had with my new car, they have been able to redirect me to the correct party. I hope they continue to provide me with the same great customer service I have been given prior to buying the vehicle.< /text>

<review>Conner was super helpful in working with us to find a car, even bringing in cars from other locations for us to check out.
All staff we met were very nice and the selection of cars for sale in the price ranges we were looking, were many!
We were actually quite surprised at how many options were available.
If you are looking for a dealer that doesn't haggle over price, we highly recommend!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The team of people who work here are always so nice, calm, professional and really helpful.  I have rented A LOT of cars in the last two years (mostly from here) and I have never had a bad customer service experience here.  The cars are always clean and well maintained, and it is not difficult to get a ride to or from here.</Text>

<text>I rent here almost every month and have found this place to be the best in the area. The customer service is excellent and the cars, which are available are clean and in great condition.  Although everyone here is really friendly, Jimmy who is the manager and Alan who is usually always available to pick you up and take you back home are two people who I have found to have always given me personal service and that special attention that is always lacking at other car rental companies.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Myles was so helpful and wonderful and worked to get the car I wanted - he even went as far as having a car (the one I ended up buying) driven up from the San Diego area.

My husband after getting in a motorcycle accident had to rent a car to get to work so we rented one from here and after 1 week we ended up purchasing a nissan rogue from this location. The process was so easy and fast erica was great and very informative and very patient with all my questions. Lucio was also great made buying a car so  easy with no stress and made us laugh the whole time. When i need an upgrade from my car this will be the location i go to! I really encourage anyone that needs a used but great maintained vehicle with low miles at a reasonable price to go here. My husband and i are very happy customers.</text>

I went in on Sunday and checked out the cars that were on two of the lots and found one that I was interested in.  I came back on Tuesday and  tried to buy a car at the Huntington Beach location. I always hate shopping for cars, because of the pressure of having someone hounding you all around. Not in this case, there was a sales person who came out and introduced himself as Michael and ask if he could assist us. We said no and he said he would be available if we needed anything. He walked away.  That was so nice to check out the cars again.  W e asked about our trade in and he jumped right on it, got us a quote and got us the keys two two different cars. We did buy one and I tell you this is the fifth car we have bought from Enterprise over a number of years.  Great experience every time.  They stand behind their word.  They also offered us several different options on payments and warranties. We tried to pay cash, but were turned away and asked for a Cashiers Check. They promised to hold the car for us until we returned the next evening.  They were so pleased to have our business. I would go back in a heart beat. They are so down to earth.<//text>

We had a great experience buying our car here, even though it was a super busy labor day weekend the staff gave us all the time and attention we needed. We didn't feel pressured or rushed. The staff took the time to research the perfect car for us, had it brought out from a different site within 45 minutes. We love our new car and feel like we got a great deal. Thank you.</Text>

I arrived 30 minutes early for my pickup and they hustled to have my vehicle ready, all the while making sure I was well taken care of.  The service team was excellent, my rental in and out was quick and hassle free.</text>

My experience with purchasing a used vehicle from Enterprise was fantastic! I spoke with Jorge via e-mail and phone many times, I went in to the sales office twice and then decided I wanted to wait a little longer before buying. Jorge never once put any pressure on me to make a purchase. Four months later when I was ready, he was more than willing to help me out, again. He found the car I wanted and had it brought to his sales office the next day. The day I went in to purchase the car I worked with Bernard who was also wonderful to work with. They have a seven day return policy so I was able to bring the car to my personal mechanic for his stamp of approval and he said that it was in great shape and I did get a very good used vehicle. I would recommend this sales office and I will use them again in the future.</text>

Friendly staff, that call me by my name each time I stop by.  I rent here frequently and the staff have the same friendly exuberant demeanor at all times.  Their pickup and drop off service is also outstanding, under "Jim, branch manager's leadership!  Thank you HB team and keep up the good work!</text>

Mike and the entire team were so helpful in finding me the perfect car! My aunt recommended me to this location after she traded her car in for a newer Jeep. I traded my 2014 Hyundai Elantra in for a Volkswagen Jetta, and I LOVE it!!! During the process of getting the car transferred to their lot, they went out other way to bring in two additional cars.... Same make/model I wanted, within my budget, just so that I could look at them and make sure I found exactly what I was looking for! I HIGHLY recommended coming in here if you are even thinking about getting another car! Prices are awesome, the don't try to sell you on things you don't need, or sell you something  for more than it's even worth. All based off KBB prices!

Ok so about two weeks out my car broke. Won't start I took great care of it and everything and didn't put that much mileage on. Will never buy from again. I changed my review. I put 2 extra stars because the service was amazing with all the employees and tepd</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I really can't recommend highly enough.  We bought a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with 15,000 miles, with a sunroof, heated and ventilated leather seats and a ton of other options.  The original sticker for the car (we looked it up on Chrysler's website) was $44,000.  We paid $6,000 less than we could have bought the same car certified from a dealer.

We originally bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo a few days before but when we had it checked out at the dealer, it had an issue that was fully covered under warranty but it worried us so we exercised the right to exchange the car within 7 days of purchase.  We located another Jeep on the Enterprise website located in their El Cajon location.  We contacted the HB location, told them we wanted to exchange and that we wanted the Jeep from El Cajon.  Mike, Aaron and Matthew (the manager) all worked to get the new Jeep from El Cajon, to take back the original Jeep and, in a single day they made the change and we got the new Jeep.  We will need a new truck in a year and the HB Enterprise Car Sales office will be our first and only stop.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1505491397262, 'text': 'Hello!

Had a great experience!! Gotta say I am completely satisfied! I wanted to deal with HB but found the car in Orange. Spoke to LT first and set up an appointment to test drive a Chevy Malibu on the lot in HB. I got a follow up call from LT telling me he had brought the car I wanted from Orange to HB!! I was thrilled.  Met Drew the day of the test drive who took me to Orange to test drive a different Malibu that I was more interested in. On top of all that, Matt took care of the entire loan process for me, contacting my bank for me. Bottom line, I love my car, again completely satisfied and felt well taken care of by LT, Drew and Matt at HB Enterprise sales!!! Thank you Enterprise!!</review>

The experience was good. the only issue was they did not have enough people working (we did have an appt) so it took quite a while to complete the sale.< /Review>

Fun place. Retro. Comfy Coffee Place to sit indoors or out on patio for hours with friends or reading books or their newspapers.</review>

Loved this one place! Creating decor, good quality foods and fantastic coffees available.  Trully liked bringing the family here for a quick meal while passing by.  Service was outstanding, and found staff to be welcoming, friendly,  and even helpful.  We were excited to stumble upon this place almost by accident,  and look forward to coming back for more. Highly recommended!< /Review>

There are a lot of coffee shops in Encinitas to choose from, but Surfdog's is by far my favorite! Laid back atmosphere with friendly staff that really embodies the vibe of Encinitas. They have a great assortment of muffins, bagels, and smoothies to choose from. And most importantly, the coffee is top-notch. Definitely swing by if you're in the area and need a cup of Joe.</Review>

Love this place! It's one of the last "old Encinitas" places left on the 101 and we are grateful that it's still there. Great coffee, great food, but most of all great service from fantastic people.
Highly recommended!< /review>

VERY POOR SERVICE! We haven't stopped by here for lunch in ages while on our Sunday bike rides on the 101. And that was because when we buy a couple of lattes we also want something to eat and they had been out of bagels as early as midday on occasions. So even though the lattes were pretty decent we got sick of stopping and finding out they had no food. We haven't bothered to stop by here in quite a few months because there are more reliable options close by. My wife and I decided to take a punt while having a late bike ride today and called in here at 1.45pm to find they had some bagels in the glass display cabinet. I spoke with a dude behind the counter about how many shots are usually used in their mugs. He kind of gave me a blank stare while holding up a mug. I asked about what milk they had available and he replied non fat and while milk. We wanted 2%. Most thinking baristas these days know they can conjure 2% fat milk by blending non fat and whole milk. I had to ask this guy can he do that? He replied that because of his self proclaimed math prowess that it should be a cinch. So I ordered 2 one shot lattes with hazelnut syrup and a Pipeline Bagel. After a few minutes we collected our lattes at the counter and sat down to drink them while we waited for our bagel. Things did seem a bit out of whack because normally when we have ordered here before the person would take payment before processing our order. We were sitting there drinking our lattes which tasted terrible .....like frothy milk and we had to ask for more hazelnut syrup. After about 15 minutes I thought where is our bagel order? I asked the math genius behind the counter and daaaaah he forgot to tell the other worker to make our lunch order. My wife then went to the counter as he requested to make our payment. Sitting there with our getting colder lousy lattes we finally got our Pipeline Bagel at 2.22pm which was 30 minutes after I ordered it. Soon after the dude brought our order to our table he disappeared out the front door obviously gone for the day. Needless to say we will never be coming back because bad service really sucks!<//review>

<text>I took a freshly squeezed medium Citrus Kick. The juice is pretty good but the service really dissapointed me.
The price on the board is 7.19 USD. Sarah who took my order made me pay 6.59 - great I thought at that moment that I have special sale as I am regular customer. 2 minutes later she called me that she made a mistake and wants me to pay more 2.49 USD. I asked why?? Because SHE made a mistake. The total was 8.99! I showed the price 7.19 on the board. She told me that the board is not ACTUAL! Seriously? You can really put whatever price you want on the cashier and have another one on the board? Well this really ruined my morning. Would not come again here.<//text>< Pictures>

The new LA Vida Mocha cold brew smoothie was great. I couldn't find the exact amount if caffeine in a large, but it seemed at least equal to a venti Starbucks Frappuccino.<//review>

Good location. Staff seemed a bit unorganized and under-trained. They were friendly enough but could use someone from a stronger location to come pick up the pieces and get this one back on its feet.< /review>

This Jamba Just has a good location as it's only a short walk away form De Anza College and Memorial Park, so it's a nice place to get a smoothie after a tiring run or long day. The staff there are nice and the place is clean, and I would recommend it to people who want to grab a smoothie. If you need any suggestions, my personal favorite drink there is the Orange Dream Machine.</Text>

My Kids were in there yesterday and while waiting in line they were told they weren’t making any drinks right now because they were backed up and they were only taking food orders. As a former Jamba Juice Manager  I have never heard of such BS. No matter how busy they were they should just let customers know that their was going to be a wait and let it be up to the customers if they wanna wait or not. This was bad customer service  and maybe they should have called more team members in for help. This is definitely a need for coaching and they should always have a plan B.< /text>

I went around closing time. The service wasn't that great. The employees were pretty busy talking to each other to work with efficiency. However, it was pretty much closing hour, but I still expected better service.<//Text>

Maybe not as healthy as one would like, but the service is awesome and the drinks are tasty.  Still better than soda or Starbucks.<//Review>

All smoothies now made with juice from CONCENTRATE, ice and/or sugary yogurt/sorbet added and the price we not too long ago paid for "power size" 30 oz we now pay for "large" 22 oz... a 26.5% increase in cost!!!! Their formula: junk ingredients pretending to be healthy, raise prices 26.5%= stupid consumers & large profits. Then the staff only fills the cups to MAYBE 18-19 oz, ANOTHER 15% increase in profit, and stealing from consumer. Amazing. And the consumer keeps coming... on top of it all, the staff is rude.

Love Jamba Juice for the variety of juices, smoothies, and now acai or pitaya bowls that they have. If you're looking for a pick-me-up for summer, this is a good spot. Love the pitaya (dragonfruit) bowl and their real-fruit smoothies that have less sugar.</Review>

Leapfrog has helped us several times over the past 5 years. The jobs have always been thoroughly and professionally completed. The plumbers kept us well informed of how the work was progressing. I appreciated the suggestions offered to get the job done. Leapfrog is the go to   company for all of our plumbing needs.</Text>

Came out to fix a leak, took them four hours to find it, eight hours to fix it. Immediately after they left they hooked something up incorrectly and caused an additional leak, the next day realized the lines they repaired they didn't reroute correctly so ended up having no water in my entire back yard, which wasn't even part of the original problem. The owner came out and said after paying them $6000 they would work with me on customer satisfaction. Over an hour late for appointment and never heard from them again. RIDICULOUS SERVICE</Text>

They repaired my in wall toilet.  While the technicians were there they  noticed that the toilet water was warm. I explained that since my new new tank less  water heater was installed we have been getting hot water in all are faucets. They asked a few questions and we found the "pass through" and the problem was solved

Leapfrog kept its scheduled appointment time.  The repair man was professional, knowledgeable, explained the situation, answered my questions, and fixed the problem in a short amount of time. Exactly the quality of service anyone would want.  I have been a long-time customer and will continue to use its services.< /Text>

Highly recommend Leapfrog. PG&E knocked on our door and say we had a small gas leak and they were shutting off our gas until we had it fixed. We were quite angry that PG&E laid this on us during a pandemic, forcing us to spend money and come into contact with people.

Nevertheless, we called LeapFrog and they couldn't have been more helpful. Worked with us to come to a workable and affordable solution with running a new gas line. Kevin and Josh did great work and were very nice. And they were flexible on scheduling.

If you have any need for a plumber, call Leapfrog!< /Text>

2 minor nits however.

Firstly, he didn't ask about or cover his shoes when he came in. Most other workers I've used had shoe coverings when they were inside.

Second, the seat he installed was a little on the flimsy side. Don't know if you offer other seats, even if you charged a little more, but it might be a good idea. I have no problem going to Home Depot and replacing it with a better quality seat, but some people may not be able to do the job.<//text>< Pictures>

It was a pleasure to work with this company, from my first call to schedule an appointment to see what was wrong with my hot water heater to the final installation. Maurice (the owner) is really an amazing guy and the technician that came to do the installation (unfortunately I don't remember his name) was pleasant,  professional and fast. I would highly recommend this company.<//Text>

Todd arrived within minutes of when he was supposed to, assessed the problem, got the paperwork and the parts, and I gave him approval to proceed, which he did, very promptly and efficiently.

I like these folks a lot.  They are friendly and professional.   Their rates are fair, too.  They have helped out at multiple properties, and all the work has been great.  Never any problems afterwards.  When I thought there might be a continuing leak, they came right out.  There was no leak.  It was residual water.  Even better news!< /Review>

I’ve used Leap Frog several times and I’m pleased with their work and quick response time. I would recommend others to give them a call, too.< /Review>

Leapfrog sent a service person out quickly, he was extremely competent and fixed the issue quickly. We have used Leapfrog before and have always been pleased with their service.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Originally had a water heater installed by American Home Shield warranty company that ended up leaking several times. I was pretty fed up with having several plumbers try and "resolve" the faulty install of a brand new water heater. I finally gave up with the warranty company and after seeing a Leapfrog plumbing van in town, I decided to give them a try. Called their number and had someone out the same day. A plumber (Kevin) came out and had the water re-installed properly within the hour. Super friendly service that ended with a quick and painless install.< /text>< gmapID>

< review>
My husband just got back from his hair appointment today and I’m so impressed!! The cut looks so clean and fresh, professional! Absolutely love it, he looks so handsome. It was his first time going to this barbershop and I told him to never go anywhere else lol. I love that it’s a very classic cut, timeless. It’s modern, but not one of those styles that’s just a fad.
The price my husband says he paid is in my opinion a great value for money, and he said the guys there were friendly and detail oriented. Great customer service. I think he said his barber’s name was Elvis.
Ladies, send your man here!</review>

I have been getting my haircuts  at Oscars Barbershop for the last 7 years. Here is how I rank my barber, when you leave the place if you feel like a million bucks. They did a good job. The cuts and specially the beards are out of this world. I get my cuts from Rico and he is professional and always on time. I appreciate the effort and the conversations. Thank you Oscars Barbershop.< /text>

I have been going to Oscar’s Barber Shop for almost a year now and hand down the best barber shop. Elvis has always been cutting my hair and he is great! I never have to ask him to even fix a spot he knows exactly what I want and like, it’s great. And whenever I ask for an appointment he is always able to get me in for a cut!<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I called to make an appointment, and they told me 9am, then 8:30am, and then 9:30am. I said great, let's do 9:30am! Unfortunately, when I arrived, they said I was late for my 9am appointment and had to wait till 10:30am to be seen. I get it, mistakes happen, but they didn't even apologize or accept fault for telling me the wrong time and/or writing down the wrong appointment time.

For people reading this review, make sure you get the name of who you spoke to, who's cutting your hair, and have them repeat the time you're penciled in for. It's unfortunate that they refused to accept responsibility for a simple mistake, and if they did, I would have stayed for my hair cut.< /Review><username>Michael Nguyen<//username></record></dataset><record>

Got my hair cut by Yitzy. Cool dude and skilled barber. He cut my hair just like I wanted.  I have no reservations in recommending Yitzy and Oscar's  barbershop for anyone looking. They made accomodations for COVID by moving the chairs outside. Highly recommended!< /text>

<userid>112759605020826498844</userid><review>Marlene (sp?) gave me the worst beard trim and line up I have ever received. Bar none. Read the wonderful reviews so thought I'd give them a try. The place has that old school barber shop feel that I love and takes me back to when I used to go with my Dad every weekend. Anyway, I digress. Came in at 5 on a Saturday for next available, explaining I needed a lineup and for my sideburns to be blended. No change in length, no crazy requests.

She began by asking me how I wanted my hair cut. I explained I wasn't there for a haircut, just the beard lineup. She asked if I was sure, because she specializes in long hair. I reiterated that I was certain. Now, most barber shops make you feel good about going in. They lather your face, straight razor, hot towel, all the while maintaining a poise and confidence that tells you they've done this a thousand times a day. This, is not what I received. My barber was very uncertain, alternating between clippers, electric razor and scissors on my cheek alone. I was spun in that chair more times than a ride at Disney with the kids. I lost faith in this shop more and more as this continued.

What I left with was an uneven beard line, beard trimmed in places I didn't ask for, my neck cut in three places (she explained it was because my hair was thick; she didn't even give/offer/ask about a straight razor, just used her electric razor) and the rest of my face feeling raw. She was going to go back over my neck again, but I politely declined as my neck was already bleeding and that electric razor was not her ally.

Three days later, with my uneven lengths, uneven sides and cuts-still-healing- beard, I've gone ahead and just shaved it off to start new because no barbershop on earth could fix the fact that I look like if Abraham Lincoln's beard had been cut by an intoxicated Edward Scissorhands. Biggest regret? Not learning price until she charged me $26 for something my niece could've done better blindfolded.<//review><Rate>1< /Rate><user_name>Erik Weatherford</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Oscar senior is the only person I go to for a hair cut or close shave. His team is talented as well. You can't go wrong if you go to Oscar's. It has a friendly environment from the time you enter to the time you leave. Walk ins are welcome but, I recommend making an appointment. Seriously, this place is great.<//text>

The hospitality aspect struggles. But the latin gentlemen who cutted my hair  was very well skilled & courteous.
Recommendation: Don't sell a service, choose kindness and you will gain a customer in your next shot.</Review>

<Text>I asked to get a shave fade and the guy said."  I would but it takes too long. I have to put on a hot towel on you and then shave you sides. My machine cuts pretty close."   I know the hair style i wanted and know what to ask for. I told him how i wanted it and it still came out wrong. I just decided that it would grow back and get a hair cut at my usual place.  When he finished he didn't even ask if i wanted ut styled, nor did he ask if i wanted product in my hair for me to style it.  The guy sucks.  He was too busy speaking with the client he had next and ignored giving me good service.<//Text>< Pictures>

Went for my first cut 2 weeks ago. I've been going since. You have a choice between barbers and each are talented. I was a walk in the fist time, but appointments are recommended.<//review>

The guy at the far end cannot cut hair. I wonder how these so call barbers get certified. When it comes to a great fade you either got it or u don't! My hair did not look clean and fresh....and he let me walk off like that. $25 dollars!! For a haircut? Wth. I rather go all the way to Canoga and pay $15 for a clean look. This place is great for elderly people.....because they have no clue of what's a good fade now days. There lease on magnolia must be high which is why they charge so much.....because my hair does not look like I spend 25....more like 7 bucks from students at a barber school. Lesson learned!<//review>

This is the most unprofessional barber shop ever. They don't follow their hours. I even called ahead and asked when they stopped talking walk ins and I arrived 15 min before that time and they still didn't take me. They lack customer service and when I told them I needed it for an interview they began making bs excuses on why they couldn't do it. Their prives are too high and the cuts aren't even that good.</review>

(Translated by Google) I do not know why it has four stars. When they do not listen to the style you want ... They only ask the one. Two or three. .. what kind of barbershop is that ... They do not know about modern cuts, they were bad but this is the worst ..

<user>110835274214414477505<//user><Date>1620252702402</Date><review>I have been to a few highly rated sandwich shops in the city and Yonkers Cafe is one of the few that are actually legit: no-frills vibe, fresh and quality ingredients, good taste, solid portion and fair prices. It gets all.

I stopped by during a weekday morning and had a Beast Mode (roasted beef, turkey, gouda, pesto, avocado). I loved it, even though there is no place to sit and I basically just ate it curbside. For the price I think it has great value. I would love to come back again (and again).<//review>< response>

<review>Omg this place is the best place for sandwiches!! The guys that work here are super friendly and super fast. I would have taken a picture of my Murphy’s breakfast sandwich but it didn’t last very long!! Great to stop by and pick up a sandwich on your way to the beach or park!!! Bonkers for Yonkers!<//review><time>1520108551373</time><Rating>5< /Rating><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Got it on a croissant for breakfast. Great buttery flavor. Much less bread than i was going for with the dutch crunch and im still full at lunch time.  Will be back to try another sandwich.</Review>< username>

Sandwich was good and tasty, quite a large portion.  Took a bit longer than I expected coming in after lunch on a weekday because there were 3-4 other sandwiches in front of mine but this definitely shows their attention to detail in making each sandwich.</text>

Friendly fast service, good food, free WiFi. Good BBQ chicken sandwich. Wish they had the Dutch crunch bread in stock.</Review>

Always fast and friendly service although they are usually very busy. Everything I've purchased has been good. The whole family loves the food here. Even the very picky youngest one. That says a lot!< /Text>

Really good selection of pour over coffee which actually was ready pretty quick. I got an english muffin with egg, cheese, and avocado, which was cooked perfectly and very fresh. I will be back before work again.< /review>

If waiting 20 minutes for coffee or 40 minutes for a bagel excites you, boy have I got a cafe for you!

Edit: oh and the sausage bagel you wait 40 minutes might come out as a bacon croissant.< /review>

Ordered the hot roast beef sandwich and I’m still blown away it was perfectly cooked and seasoned with fresh veggies in the middle. I ordered a Caesar salad on the side thinking the sandwich may be small, (first time here) it was not. Now I have a big salad for dinner. I will be coming back here.< /review>

Absolutely delicious coffee and fabulous breakfast egg sandwiches on a croissant, bagel or English muffin.   Reasonable prices and quick professional service.  Way better than Devil's teeth and the line is shorter.<//review>

<Review>Rad little neighborhood spot. Not enough tables for the busy times, but they can’t have that held against them in that little shop, and if anything it’s an indicator of their quality. Solid breakfast sandwiches at a reasonable price, and good coffee, ground, & poured over to order, and the largest selection of blends and roasts I know of.<//Review>< pics>

OMG, the sandwiches are delicious here! I had a bite of my sister's BLT and dreamt about it for days. The Golden Gate is divine & they do not scrimp on the fillings. I have converted all the people I have taken there & wished I lived closer!<//Review>

Wow, my new favorite sandwich shop. Ordered the Yonkers signature, pastrami, avacado, Gouda, with everything. The meat was nice and hot but not dry and over toasted, and the avacado was perfect and fresh. Can't wait to go back again. The wait is a bit long, but worth the wait for a master piece.<//Text>

Rating it as it's listed as a wine bar--- don't go here looking for a wine bar! Wines start at $10 a glass, but there's no environment here, and the staff doesn't know about the wines, nor is the selection interesting. Total bust on that end.  But deli food is good!!< /Review>

The sandwiches are a little on the enormous side so just get one to split with your friend.

Tons of coffee to chose from!!

Yonkers Cafe is a cute little cafe serving wine, coffee, and sandwiches. It's located in the same vicinity as Toyose and Devil's Teeth but you would never know that it was there unless you walked in. The owners had samples of essentially all their sandwich specials during our event so I was lucky enough to try them all. The Yonkers special is probably my favorite one. It's perfect if you wanted to pick something up to snack on at the beach due to its close proximity. By no means are the sandwiches huge or cheap, but for what it's worth they're piled high and are very delicious. They have a pretty decent wine selections as well. Only got to tried the chardonnay and the rose, but thought it was awesome that they offered wine/beer on top of the fact that they serve bomb sandwiches.

It's a small place but they do have a tv playing whatever game is on, free wifi, and a clean bathroom! All in all, this place makes for a great detour if you happen to be in the area!</review>

<review>Yonkers Cafe replaced Sea Biscuit Cafe & Wine Bar, which apparently is a spot where numerous stores have been built and destroyed. After coming here, I can confidently say that the only time Yonkers Cafe will move out is because of the lack of space that it could accommodate its customers.

TL;DR version:

1. Good food - get the Yonkers special
2. Great customer service
3. I endorse Yonkers Cafe

ATMOSPHERE:
This cafe is relatively small. If I could guess the maximum capacity, I would put it between 15-20. Once you enter the cafe, I would say that the vibe is a mood booster. There are booth chairs and booths inside with Wi-Fi so you could do work here! On the side near the door, there are stacks of cups and a container filled with water for self-serve.

FOOD & DRINKS:
The sandwich that I got was the Yonkers Special, which had pastrami inside of the ciabatta bun. Honestly, I didn't know what pastrami was until my boyfriend told me that it was splendid and that I should try it. Best decision of the day! The Yonkers Special was incredibly flavorful. I requested to have "everything" included. Each ingredient perfectly complemented each other from every bite. I thought I was going to get full from eating the whole sandwich, but in fact, I was still craving more!

I tried both their hot and iced coffee which was probably one of the best coffee I've ever tried. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I'm down to get some from Yonkers.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The definition of superlative customer service can be found here. As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted by employees here as if I was visiting a friend. I don't know about you, but when employees are smiling when they take my order, it gives me a positive vibe, and the chances of me coming back are higher.

One thing that stood out to me for the duration of my visit at Yonkers was Devil's Teeth Baking Company, who I would say is their competitor on Noriega Street because of the proximity. Let me tell you that Devil's Teeth has nothing on Yonkers. Yes, their breakfast sandwich may be tasty, but Yonkers hands down beats Devil's in the atmosphere of their respective restaurants, food & drinks, and most definitely in customer service. Devil's Teeth's customer service is non-existent. I remember my first visit and that's an ever-lasting impression on a consumer.

Would I come back here? Yes! Would I recommend this to friends? Hell yes!

My name is AJ Cartas and I approve of this business.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We will never use this place again! My son needed his car towed 2 blocks from the house because it was inoperable..ez tow is less about 3 or 4 blocks from our house as well..they told us it would be about 45 min b4 arrival..after a hour and 15 min we called and they said oh he will be there in 12 min..ok still no tech after half hour..we called again got hung up on...called again...finally the guy shows up..hes here for 5 min loads the car on the tow truck and charges us a whopping $300!!! I called to complain and was told that I would be contacted by a manager but no one ever reached out..not only were we OVERCHARGED but we almost missed getting our car worked on by the mechanics because of their delays! Never use these guys!<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Don't expect Easy Towing to show up on time, IF EVER. Yesterday I called at 2:45, simple tow from gas station along Hwy 50 to my son's apt. They said it would take 45 min to an hour. Called at 3:50, where's my tow? Oh it will be there soon. Called at 4:15. Oh, it will be there in 20 minutes. Called at 4:40. Told them to refund my $50 cancellation fee as I no longer needed their tow. If they charge me I will cancel it on my credit card and they can fight the bank. Finally got an apology from an employee after I told them how poorly I was treated. I will never call Easy Towing again and recommend you stay away from them also! I waited over 2 hours in 100 degree heat! Least you could do is be honest when something comes up. Everyone has a cell phone.<//review>< Pics>

Do you yourself a favor and do not call for a tow from this company. We wish we had known. Sunday, October 11, our suburban broke down on the freeway. We called them at 4:39 PM and they told us that someone would be there in 45 minutes. Before we ended the call, I reconfirmed the time and he said well it might be one hour. No one showed. We called back at 5:46 PM. They told us someone be there in 15 minutes. No one showed. We called back at 6:06 pm and they told us the driver was 9 miles south of us on the freeway headed our way. No one showed. We finally called back, realizing that we were being repeatedly lied to, nd for some reason got the actual driver who told us that he wasn’t anywhere close and that we have been talking to has been lying to us. We canceled with this disgraceful business operation.<//Review>

We broke down during the city curfew. Called our insurance for a tow. Izzy got to us on time and towed us home late at night. He knew no one else would pick up the call. It was a long drive and he had no problems doing it. He is awesome. Will definitely use them again!<//review>

<text>These folks are horrible.  They charged me for no service.  They showed up at my job and then left and never called or showed back up to preform the move.  However they still charge me.  Never use this company they will rip you off and not provide service.  The worst company ever.<//text>< Pics>

Lousy experience when I got my SUV towed to a repair shop. I was quoted $50 for a four mile tow. However, I was charged $145 instead. Not happy one bit. I'll be reporting Easy Towing to the BBB.</text>

Easy towing quoted me ~$100 for a 3 mile tow. The charge on my card was $144 for roughly 30 minutes of work. When I called to inquire about being charged the maximum, I was given terrible information and nothing but lip service from Maria with customer service. I asked her questions about the pricing breakdown and she got more and more aggressive and eventually she hung up on me. She does not understand the meaning of customer service. I am very disappointed in the dishonest quote, service, and terrible response and attitude from Maria.

On another note, the driver was timely and pleasant through the interaction.</text>

< Review>
Tried to get a tow and they took so long to get to me I was at Arden Fair Mall By Nordstrom’s on the 3rd floor in the garage and when the man got here he told me his tow truck was to big so someone else had to come and no one ever came nor tried to contact me back and when I called the place they said they was going to contact the driver and called me back. I never got a call and then next thing I know I was blocked and didn’t get my car towed to</Review>

<text>My car overheated while driving on the freeway so I ended up stranded off the highway. After speaking with the lady there at Easy Towing and getting their price i told her i will call around and i will call Easy Towing back if I get no luck.  I called back to your company number and it's blocked me and I call back the cell number and they're not answering my calls anymore.  Just when I really needed you to help me get my car and myself home you block me.  I'm cold, alone, and afraid out here and you blocking me shows how unprofessional and inhumane you are.</text>< Pictures>

Great service! I had a car accident, and after calling, they  came to the rescue after I was waiting over 2 -3 hours for another towing company to come. He was kind, pleasant and made a stressful day a bit more pleasant. Thank you!</text>

Their pricing is such a SCAM! They rush through the pricing over the phone and don’t give you a price over until the tow person is there.

They wanted to charge me $210 for a 10 mile tow. Don’t do business with these people. They told me the tow would be there in 45 minutes. I waited over 2 hours. I didn’t receive any proactive calls letting me know the wait was longer than expected. I had to call in twice to get any sort of update.

If I could give a negative star rating I would.< /review>

They gave my senior father a quote of $139 for mobil battery install on old car.....come out 3 hours later and the guy claims it's his first try and that's why the horn was beeping for 35 minutes.... then comes the new price of almost $400 I'm reporting them to the BBVA don't even think about calling these FRAUDS</text>

So I hope everyone sees my review first before calling , don't call these ppl I had them go out to my mom's car t tow it they said they would be there in 45 minutes not to leave cause they would charge her card or canceled , my mom was there for more then 2 hours (mind you the towing company was on Arden and my mom was on El Camino ) littlerly a few minutes . I called them like twice then second time they told me the tow guy had pulled over to put gas !!!! My mom was waiting for them 1hour and thirty minutes because he had to but gas they said he would be there in 10 minutes and takes thirty minutes more when the towing company had told me that he was down the street putting gas , why is he putting gas on our Time when we are paying for his service and on top of that take almost 3 hours to get there . They over charge you as  well they charged me 140 to take the car down street .< /review>

This company is horrible. It is by far one of the most unprofessional companies i have ever dealt with. Some rude Mexican lady told me to deal with the issue myself and hung up on me before i could say anything else. I called back asking to speak to a manager and she told me "I am the manager, deal with it yourself" and proceeded to scream other rude things into the phone.  This lady, whoever she is needs to learn basic customer service 101, or be fired. nasty company, STAY AWAY.< /Text>

I really like that the company sends an e-mail so that you can see where your tech is in their appointments for the day, and then you get a call when the tech is actually on their way to your appointment. George was very nice and very professional.  The work was finished quickly and there was no mess of any kind when he was done. Very happy with my service, and results.<//text>< userid>

<Text>Technicians dispatched to our house were professional and competent, as well as friendly. Only marked two stars because they finally, after two months, accomplished the replacement of the ice maker.
Appliance Repair Specialist, like most corporations, seem to trend to be as impersonal as possible using only technology voice mail responses to communicate. Do not expect a human, humane, response.
I gave up calling the company because no one would answer the phone, except for two times. I communicated my issues to Whirlpool directly as my refrigerator was still under warranty.
My attempt to communicate to the technician an additional issue, leaking water, was fruitless. The receptionist at  Appliance Repair Specialist had the disposition of a honey badger. The second time, it was evident she didn't want to be on the phone so I kept it short.
The time I wasted waiting for someone to answer the phone at Appliance Repair Specialist still makes me angry. I reported my experience to Whirlpool, but they are a corporation too.
I hope all consumers are aware, by now, that "there are no reliable refrigerators built by any company." You need to have a pre 1980 refrigerator as a back up now as the best insurance insurance. Do your research.< /Text>< Response>

Mine was something I felt SHOULD have been covered under warranty but Whirlpool declined, which made it all a bit bitter.  There was a service/visit charge and a separate labor charge but that may be industry standard..

The technician - I can only say positive things about.  He was on time, worked with me agreed to reduce the charge since whirlpool had not informed me of the separation of fees.  He fixed it quickly, showed me the damaged parts and was pleasant and professional throughout..< /Text>

<text>These people are complete crooks. I setup service and they told me everything was covered under warranty. They then guessed at the issue and put a new part in that did not solve the issue. My refrigerator is warm and my food is still spoiling.  They then proceeded to send me an invoice for over $200 and refuse to fix the actual issue. Steer clear of this company at all costs.< /text><user_name>Nick Bruno</user_name></record>

The Pope repair man visited and installed new parts on our dishwasher two times, neither of which solved the problem.  On the third visit he said he would not work on our appliances again.
We called Appliance Repair Specialist and they sent Kenneth.  He immediately identified the problem, ordered and installed the PROPER part and the problem was solved.  On two subsequent repair calls, for other appliances, we have requested Kenneth. Each time, he has diagnosed and repaired the problem quickly and competently. I will continue to request Kenneth for all my appliance repairs.  He's very knowledgeable, a fast worker, and pleasant to work with. I highly recommend him!!< /Review>< Pictures>

The repair people who came to my house to repair my washing machine were always very nice and professional. But, they did not have parts to do the repairs when they figured out what was wrong. I was supposed to get a call back to reschedule. I never got a call, so I called in. I was told by customer service that they would not have all of my parts for 6-8 weeks, Not getting a call was unprofessional. .I had to call Lowe's, the company who contracts their service, to get help. As soon as Lowe's got involved they had the parts the next day and scheduled the repairs for the following day.< /Review>

The service repair person was focused on customer service: prompt,  experienced, and polite. I would definitely welcome him back for future repairs.

A note for the administrator in charge of Appliance Repair Specialist.
He got 4 cell phone calls from the dispatch office which he ignored so he could stay focused on completing the repair. He finally answered and was directed by the dispatch office person to call a concerned customer. The technician explained to the dispatch office person that he was in the middle of a repair and would call that customer in a couple of minutes. Apparently the dispatch office person insisted that he make the call immediately, so he did.  I was a few yards away watching TV and heard the phone conversations. The technician apologized over and over for the interruption. I told him I understood and knew he had no control over the situation. He completed the fridge repair to my satisfaction. It was difficult to see him having to make a decision between focusing on completing my fridge repair and being pressured into making a call to another customer.< /review>

This young man has been to my home on past occasions to repair both the dishwasher and washing machine.  He is very knowledgeable and proceeds in a professional manner to get the work done.  I especially appreciate during the 'viral' pandemic, that Kevin is ultra safety-conscious and always wears a substantial face mask.  He realizes this is not the time for idle conversation, and keeps his focus on the task at hand.  He is an intelligent, efficient technician; and I would recommend his commendable service to any family member or friend in need of appliance repair.<//text>

The repair person responded to our request for a new bottom to our Kitchenaid oven.  There was no hassel, and no problem at all.  In one week he was back with the part and cleaned all the residue from my oven after the installation. It was like new. He was polite and professional. He really knew what he was doing. I would recommend him for any appliance repair.< /Text>

<text>I had a Maytag dishwasher repaired by them less then a year ago. It is broken again, with the same problem. When they originally came out they replaced the pump, than said that was not the problem and then had to replace the board. After they canceled the appointment twice,  they finally came out a few days ago and charged me 115 dollars to show up and spend 15 min to tell me the pump is bad again. They need to put another one in, and it will cost me an additional 164 dollars. That will be 279 dollars for them to replace something that was just fixed under a year ago and is still under the 1 year parts Warranty.  Then to add further insult I have called multiple times in the last few days to get the part ordered and set another appointment, but have only been able to leave them a message. I have still not heard back from them...</text>< pictures>

Antonio was so professional,  conscientious, and respectful to my home. He quickly assessed the issue and fixed it. He gave me great suggestions on different products to help my dishwasher smell clean and fresh. I placed and order for the product right on the spot and am very happy with the outcome.

I will tell my family and friends to use this company if needed.<//text>

When I finally did get a hold of them, they informed me that the technician cancelled last minute and that was the reason for the no-show.  I asked if that was typical, and they responded by saying that they "can't control if their technicians call out."  It was a very poor experience that left me looking for an alternate service provider.<//Text>< pics>

Appliance repair service was really Great ! They sent out a Gentleman named Dane who was a real professional. Dane was not only an expert in his field, his customer service skills were impeccable. Very courteous and professional throughout the entire experience. He also wasted no time. Although we had to wait a few weeks to get the parts, when they came in,
Dane changed out the compressor and soldered new lines and had everything working in less than 45 minutes. Dane and Appliance Repair gave me outstanding service !</Text>

<Review>Still waiting for the sixth visit to repair the refrigerator. The online scheduler is pointless. They call you the next day and tell you they can't make the appointment you scheduled and set one up for a week later. They come out and don't fix the problem. You have to call them every day to get them to schedule the next visit because they won't schedule it until the parts arrive in their office. Generally very frustrating to work with, especially since they tell you upfront they can only fix the symptoms and not the cause (plugged drain backs up water and shorts out the electronics).< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This company is AWFUL! They are at returning calls and coming out in a timely matter. They half way repair what they need to repair. They have to come out multiple times to get things fixed. If they don’t want to fix it they just tell you it isn’t covered under the warranty and leave you hanging they are horrible!<//text>

I can honestly say that this is the first company that I have used that fixed an appliance very quickly and efficiently. Service person Cruz was very professional, friendly and considerate.  This was a pleasant experience that resolved the issue quickly.  Thank you.</Text>

The service technician was very polite and professional.  He addressed all of my concerns and even found another concern I wasn't aware of and took care of it as well.  He had some helpful hints on how to utilize my dishwasher better as well.  I was very pleased by my service.<//Review>

<review>The customer service is terrible. The service person Alandra is rude and quick to disconnect calls. The service is just as bad. They will set a 4-hour window, then show up at the house with no parts. Then they set another appointment, also with a 4-hour window.
Each time they have come out for repairs, it was for the same issue. It goes out within a few months after the "fix" it. This has been an on-going issue because they do not actually fix the unit. A 1-star rating is generous for this company.</review>< Pics>

I spent 6 months without a washer waiting for parts that would arrive and then suddenly disappear or turn up damaged on the day it came to install them.   Not even a call to say they weren’t coming.  They blamed the supplier and I believed it.   When the part finally did show the washer was still broken.   Whirlpool sent another service company People’s Choice and the issue was properly diagnosed and part supplied within a week.     Cut to a year later and ARS is back to fix a clunking noise.  Same deal part arrives repair scheduled and then no show.   Reorder part and 2 weeks later kind service man installs it says he’s tested it.  30 minutes after he leaves run a load and clunk remains.   ARS says tickets closed and I have to start over.   I hate them.</review><Response>None</Response><Rate>1< /Rate><username>Susannah wijsen</username>< pics>

“Where do I start. I bought a brand new Kitchen Aid refrigerator in January 2020. In Late July our ice maker stopped work. We called Kitchen Aid and they called Appliance Repair Specialist. They came out and looked at the refrigerator I also explained that the refrigerator started making a humming/hissing noise about the same time the ice maker stopped working, but the tech told me the refrigerator was just settling. He said he needed to order the parts for the ice maker and will return once the parts where in. A couple of days after the tech was here we noticed our freezer wasn't keeping things frozen (only 12 degrees) I called Kitchen Aid again they contacted Appliance Repair Specialist again to set up an appointment. Appliance Repair Specialist called me and we set up an appointment for 8/26 between 10am -1pm. They didn't show up for the appointment and when I called them they told me that they don't do appointments without bring the parts to fix it. I told them this is a separate issue the freezer isn't working correctly. The young lady told me she would call me back with an answer. She never called me back. I called Kitchen aid for the third time and told them what happened. They tried to call Appliance Repair Specialist but they didn't answer the phone. Yesterday I received a call from Isabelle from ARS to set up an appointment for today because the parts for the ice maker where in. I asked her about my appointment last week but didn't have any answers. She told me I have already said sorry three time what more do you want me to do. So today we had an appointment from 9am to 11am. At 11:15 my wife calls to ask where is the tech. The woman on the phone told her he was there and no one answered the door. When the tech arrived he said he was still at his last job and never told the woman we weren't home. (why did she lie) Also when the tech showed up he said he didn't have the parts for the ice maker, he was here to look at the freezer. I don't understand the lack of customer service we are getting from this company (Appliance Repair Specialist) So now I have been without an ice maker and freezer for over a month. I understand they don't have the parts. It's the very poor customer service we received from Appliance Repair< /Text>

<Review>Rough start with the original diagnosis missing some downstream problems and REALLY long wait period for first round of parts given Covid 19 supply chain issues.  After first follow-up and complete diagnosis, only had to wait a week for parts and problem was solved.  Not perfect, but the service element was good - supply and diagnosis problems were probably unavoidable<//Review>< user>

<Time>1598665711669< /Time><rating>4< /rating><Review>Repairman was very professional and courteous. However, we've had problems with our dishwasher since day one. I got the feeling he didn't believe me. We did not get the manual with the dishwasher. Kinda felt like I was getting gently scolded for not doing ALL these things I simply didn't know about. The demanded actions nullify a lot of the features of the dishwasher. Like running hot water before you run the dishwasher or the heater will shut itself off. I guess you can't use the delay timer then. Scrubbing the whole interior with jet dry regularly...really? No chance the thing isn't drying correctly. Not really his fault but if this dishwasher is that finicky, why pay for all it's features or have it in the first place. Typical couldn't be anything wrong with he product, it's idiotic users causing all the problems.< /Review>< Pics>

He diagnosed the problem, ordered parts, set up a follow-up appointment  for installation.   We'll see if the temp is now regulated appropriately.   The admin staff was great about calling  to confirm appointments  as well.<//Text>

<Review>The technician, Isidro Lopez was fabulous!  He actually had to alter the part to get it to work and it worked.   He saved us $1,500 by repairing a KitchenAid trash compactor that was part of the sale of our house.  He cannot tell you how much we appreciated his expertise.   He was very professional.   If we hadn't received the survey,  we would have written a letter telling you how happy we were with him.<//Review><GmapID>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac<//GmapID><pics>None< /pics>< username>

My girls were the ones here during the repairs.
we reached out for assistance with our washer. It was quickly inspected and repaired.
Unfortunately it went down again, but not due to the repair.
The washer even though its new failed!
We called again and once again they came out quickly.
The repair man fixed the unit quickly and efficiantly.
The repair time was a bit lengthy between the
Two repairs but my wife and girls are happy again.
Highly recommended!

Thank you,< /text>

Referred to them from extended warranty. Juan was excellent; diagnosed problem quickly and then determined that motor was out of stock, so couldn't schedule completion of repair till motor arrived. Company recommended that we reach out to Kitchenaid directly to get the motor shipped more quickly and once it arrived, they were able to come out within a few days. Juan was very efficient and pleasant. They had another technician come out initially and he was non-communicative and left without explaining to my wife what was needed, and said we should call the company to have someone else come out. So mixed bag, but Juan was great!< /Text>

<review>It took three times for our refrigerator to be serviced. One was the initial $105 service call. The second was supposed to take place a week later, but an hour before the technician was going to arrive he called stating that the wrong part had been ordered. Then the third time finally occurred about two and a half weeks after the first one, and the job was completed. I felt I should have received a little discount for the delay in my refrigerator being serviced and for having to be home for three different times. Our technician, Raymond, was friendly and was able to do the job without having to take the door completely apart for the ice maker.</review>< Name>

Tech was great.  Scheduling is not great, had to schedule three times and the wait is inconvenient.  Ended up just paying for a repair instead of waiting for the factory/warranty repair.<//Text>

On time knew exactly what to look for and had the part in his truck.
Just about the fastest and least troublesome appliance repair I ever had.< /Review>

<text>My ice maker quit working on my brand new whirlpool fridge. These guys came out and quickly identified the problem.  A tiny tiny tiny speckle of Styrofoam from the new packaging got stuck in the part that regulates the temperature. Such a simple, quick fix. Yet I could have never fixed that on my own. So grateful to have my ice maker making ice again.< /text>< pics>

My recommendation for Appliance Repair Specialist is 5 STARR.  The technician Randy was professional, informative, and competent in servicing my Maytag Dishwasher.  A part was ordered, and put in the machine,  but unfortunately did not work because of different issue needing an Electrician.  I would definitely use Appliance Repair again.< /text>

But when irvin floyd the repair man came to fix my washer he did the best work I have ever experienced.  He had a hard time taking the part off at one point he said the part wouldn't budge.

Our KitchenAid dishwasher is only 5 months old and already needed service. The control panel had been acting up within the first month of purchase but disregard it. Thought maybe we were imaging it. Finally it got so bad it was draining and the buttons would turn off. Since it was within the first year it was still under the manufacturer’s warranty. I call KitchenAid and they assigned this repair company. Was able to schedule a appointment next day. Service rep was very though and helpful. He was easy to understand and came prepared to fix the problem then and there. He was definitely one of
The best repair guys we have ever had!< /Review>

Isidrio discovered why our new washer and dryer weren't working properly, and was the first technician of four who had previously tried to solve the problems. He calibrated the washer, which had already had two parts replaced. He also discovered that the dryer lacked sufficient ventilation to allow the towels to dry properly. He listened, took his time, and really cared about solving the issues we've been having with these machines. We highly recommend his work and his interested, professional manner. Prior to his visit, we thought we'd need to buy new machines, although ours are still under their original warranty. Now we know it takes the right tech to get the job done. Thank you for sending him.< /Text>

Isidore came twice to work on our refrigerator/freezer that is under the mfr's one year warranty. The gasgets on both doors were coming loose. On his first appointment he tried somewhat successfully to re-attach the gaskets with heat. He also  ordered replacement gasgets in case they separated again from the doors.. I called and he made a second trip to install the new gasgets.  Isidore was on time, worked efficiently, and explained what he was doing.  I would be happy to work with him in the future.</text>

Requested a service call for a leaking dishwasher. Dispatcher kept me updated on the progress of the request, the technician arrived early for the appointment, quickly identified the issue and quoted a repair. The repair cost was more than a replacement unit, so that's where we finished up - but I appreciated his professionalism to not try and sell an uneconomic repair.<//review>

<user_name>Lise Lieberman<//user_name><Date>1598405429172<//Date><rate>1<//rate><review>I called to report an issue with my ice maker. The receptionist who scheduled the appointment was ghetto (I can say that because I was raised in the ghetto). I didn’t get a call until from the tech until 10 min before the technician showed up. The technician pushed a few buttons on my panel (which I could’ve done myself) and said nothing was wrong with my ice maker. He came at 4:00 pm and I checked for ice at 10:00 and still no ice. When I removed the ice tray, there was a clump of ice underneath it. I had to place another repair call the next day to have someone come out once again (which took 5 attempts). I feel that he was done for the day and didn’t do a proper and thorough check. Had he done a proper and thorough check, I would have a nice cold glass of water with ice in my hand right now (6:30 pm the next day and still no ice). It’s 103 degrees and we have no cold water or ice in our dispensary!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Took his time, made sure my dishwasher was perfect before he finished his job. After completing the job he had me try it out to make sure it was good. After hearing a noise when open and closing the dishwasher he was not pleased with the noise .He went out to truck got some extra tools and make sure he took care of the noise. He had me again check his work to make sure I was satisfied. If ever I need assistance with any of my appliances I would ask for Jim.< /Review>

The repair  man was very professional, didn't take long to complete the job. Gave us helpful hints,  He should train other repair specialist.

The actual repair guys were great, but having specifically booked a time slot between 12-4 for extremely good reason, and confirming by phone with the Manager, we were called the day before and told they would be there between 8-9am. This was impossible for us. They said our only option therefore was to cancel that day altogether. What is the point of allowing timeslots to be booked if the company then doesn't keep them, and has to cancel completely for 3 days later instead? Again, they did a good repair and got the job done, but communication was appalling.</Review>

Appliance Repair Specialist Tim Jones serviced a leak in my washer.  We called on Tuesday and an appointment was made for Friday PM.  Communication was excellent and they furnished a link for us to view his progress through the day.  The washer was a warranty item.  Tim arrived within the scheduled time frame. and wasted little time in getting to the problem.  He explained where the water was leaking from as well as showing me how he found the issue.  He did have the part on his vehicle and replaced it quickly.  He was very professional and patiently answered all my questions.  Thank you, Tim!< /Text>

This service person saw the evidence of the washers problems, but decided that he didn’t find any thing wrong with the appliance.  I had used a small brush to clean the draining problem a few days before he came.  I explained to him that this has been done quite frequently to stop the leak which is something that I have never done to our previous washer that we had for ten+ years aside from normal cleaning.  His statement to this was “If i’t see a leak there is nothing that i can do“.  I responded that he knew there was a leak and he also knew that a previous service person had come and found the same problem. He was extremely rude.  He did not introduce himself.  He simply asked me to show him where the washer was. He told us to contact Whirlpool to address this leak with the company.  This was a complete waste of time.  Costco sent this guy.  We have purchased several appliances from Costco and had not had this kind of problem.  We don’t want to see this person at our house again!!!</Text>

For the 3rd time the lid to my Maytag washer broke. It is made of plastic and keeps breaking because of plastic. Last time was 2 mo. Ago.
This time the Tech was good he let us know he was coming through the gate he wore a mask.
He check that the wash machine was level he actually check some other stuff he replace brackets on the side which none of the other 2 have ever done so maybe this time the lid will not break off<//review>

<time>1602440942894<//time><review>Juan, the person who did the repair was knowledgeable, efficient and did a nice job.  However, Appliance Repair Specialists customer service is terrible.  Scheduling was difficult: they did not show up on the appointment day and then could not give us a time frame for the rescheduled day.  Schedules seemed to be at their convenience, not the customer.  This was a warranty repair but ARS charged us $395.  They have an exclusive warranty repair contract with Whirlpool and they are taking advantage of it.  The appliance dealer said they receive innumerable calls about how truly terrible this ARS is.  I will avoid this company like the plague and hope that Juan goes to work for an honest company< /review>< user_name>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Our problem is with a KitchenAid (krfc704fbs, msrp @ $4500) refrigerator's icemaker. Dane is an incredible human being. He's honest, hard-working, and knows his tasks. He's friendly and does an extremely good job of explaining to us, his clients, the nature of the problem and what he has to do to fix the problem. At the same time as maintaining his professionalism, he's also patient, very considerate, and does empathize with us regarding our appliance problem. As far as I am concerned, five stars is insufficient to describe the man; and I believe ARS does a good job, too.
My problem, and it continues even after Dane has done his job, is that the icemaker in our refrigerator is a poor excuse for an icemaker. It is now 4:45 pm on November 12. Dane "fixed" our problem by 1:00 pm yesterday. In the ensuing 27 3/4 hours, the icemaker has not yet produced a full container of ice. That's not Dane's fault, nor is it ARS's fault. The refrigerator simply does not do what you would expect from a $4500 appliance, and that is KitchenAid's fault.</Text>< time>

I like that they email their repair technician's schedule.  You know how many people are before you, And when they are done with an appointment.  Very accurate.  Thanks.<//Text>

Tech was less than professional, said he'd be back with the part on Wednesday, but didn't give a time. When I called on Tuesday, after no reply to my service update request online, I was told the part might be in on Friday. The tech was unfriendly and rude. I can't recommend this company at this point. I hope the return visit with the warranty part goes better.<//text>

The repair was completed as part of an extended warranty agreement with Lowe’s.

The repair company was consistently courteous and professional.  The receptionist checked the usual COVID protection questions.   I received another call when they could not fulfill my first appointment choice.   I received a third call when the technician was scheduled to arrive in twenty minutes.

The technician, Gene, was prompt and courteous and wearing a mask as he exited the repair truck.   He followed me to the house and asked questions to ascertain whether he had all the information to begin.   He was willing to explain his work and unloaded the entire freezer quickly and efficiently.

He willingly cleaned up a bit of water and when done, he shoved the refrigerator back against the wall.  The refrigerator works very well now.

The  company is well represented by this repair technician.   Diane Rountree , Porterville.</review>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>The Technician was good and polite.  However, he was not able to fix my stove, which is brand new.   If you put the oven on for more than 1/2 hour, the front handle and burner knobs are way too hot to touch.  You cannot even touch the handle, and that is very dangerous.  So far two techs have come out, but no one can help.  In fact, I was told that the stove was just poorly made.   I need Whirlpool to do something about this, as my warranty says they can replace it.  The Technician did his job but I am very unhappy with Whirlpool!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Service man arrived on time and appeared professional.  However, even though, Appliance Repair Specialist had the Model Number (MHN33PDCWW1) and Serial Number, the service man stated that he was not familiar with nor did he have the diagnostics for this machine.  He used my manual and proceeded to push buttons.  He changed the pricing codes and had to call someone to be walked through the resetting of the price codes. He put the machine through one wash cycle with no clothes in the drum and after the cycle finished, he stated that there was nothing wrong with the machine. He pushed some more buttons, collected the service fee and left.  I had to reset the pricing codes (he left them set to $2.00 normal and $42.50 power wash). Machine was not repaired and clothes were left very wet at end of wash cycle.

I called a friend of mine who is an appliance repair person and he came to look at my machine.  He removed the back cover and found the belt on the bottom of the machine.  Installed new belt.  Washer fixed.  Works great.

No.  I do not recommend Appliance Repair Specialist.<//review>

WORST EXPERIENCE!!! My washer broke on 10/2 and they came out on 10/6. Didn't have the part and had to order it, telling me it may take 5-7 business days. I wait 7 business days, call and wait on hold a minimum 15 min each time, and they tell me the part will not be in until 10/28. I call Whirpool and set something up for this company to get the part early. They finally get the part on 10/22. I call them on 10/23 to set the appointment and they tell me they can come on 10/28. Set the appointment and get a call on 10/26 that they can't come now until 10/30 because the worker is off and no one can fill in. I am promised the very first appointment on the 30th and now my appointment time is being changed AGAIN!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT HELFPUL OR KIND IN ANY WAY!!! I WOULD NEVER USE THEM BUT THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT WHIRLPOOL WOULD ALLOW TO FIX MY WASHER BASED ON THEIR WARRANTY! SO FRURSTRATED!<//text>

Hector did an amazing job working on my Kitchen Aid Refrigerator/Freezer.  The ice maker had frozen ice obstructing the opening for the ice to drop.  Hecktor worked on it and was able to melt the frozen ice.
The icemaker is now working perfedctly.
Thank you, Hector.< /review>

Horrible customer service. After being put on hold for nearly 3 hours (no exaggeration) we were finally helped. The phone number on the website does not give direct contact with the repair specialists, which is very misleading. They need to have a system where you can leave your name and phone number and someone calls you back because it was EXTREMELY difficult to contact them.</Review>

I had a problem with a brand new Whirlpool refrigerator I purchased through Home Depot. Whirlpool coordinated a repair with Appliance Repair Specialist. I cannot speak about the cost of the repair since my repair was under warranty but I was extremely happy with the service!

Francisco, the repair specialist who was assigned to me, is skilled, friendly, and pro-active. He was very empathetic and understood how awful it is to have a non-working brand new refrigerator especially during COVID-19. During his first visit, he took time to inspect all the possible damages on the fridge and once he found out what's the most likely cause, he did his best to secure the parts and earliest time slot so that we don't have to wait too long. I am very satisfied with his service and though we would prefer not to have problems with our fridge anymore, I would definitely request him again if problems show up again.

Francisco also wore his face mask, gloves, and shoe coverings the whole time while he was at our residence.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>We bought a refrigerator at Home Depot that after 28 months, died from a power surge. Fortunately we had purchased the 5 year protection plan, so we called Home Depot and they were ultra responsive and we had George from Appliance Repair Specialist out to our place the next day. He quickly identified the problem and told us he would be back in 2 days with the circuit board that was needed. He arrived first thing in the morning two days later with the part and Voila! our fridge was working again. Kudos to Appliance Repair Specialist, to George and to Home Depot for making a potentially terrible experience into at most, an inconvenient one. Thank you!!! (I have since, bought a good surge protector for the fridge.)<//Review>< pics>

<review>I liked the technician "Mike" he explained the process well and used the online technician when the problem was not resolved after the first repair attempt was not successful. The repair accually cost less than thought, however the overall cost for the repair was high in my opinion. One LED light $281? In the future I will repair myself to save some money, the LED light online is $50 and easy to replace. I would have given a 5 star rating if this was just for the tech. "Mike" but due to the overall cost for a simple repair I had to mark it down a bit.</review>< gmap_id>

Great Service and Great Technician knew what he was very knowledgeable. He knew how to troubleshoot the issue, fix it, and prevented another issue from later on down the line. I would give 4.5 out of 5 stars but can't and here's why. After the assessment, I was under the assumption that they would have their own supply of parts for repairs but instead they had to order them only after the store I had my warranty with would release the authorization for them to order the parts. So instead of it taking 1 week for it to be fixed, it took 3 weeks. But because of the Technicians knowledge of the machine he was able to temporarily fix my washer so I can still use it while I waited for the parts to be released for order and installation.<//review>

Coming from 25+ years of customer service & dispatch, I know without a doubt their staff could do a better job of communication with the client. Especially when they say " we will call you back within the hour" or "we will call on this day if your part does it doesn't come in". Rule #1 to customer service is never lie and IF you DO DON'T get caught doing it. Time and time again the customer service reps did not do what they said they would. After 36 days trying get our washer repaired I had to become "that" customer to get any progress.<//Review>

Your office and service tech were amazing. The office replied quickly with an appt and the tech that came out was very nice and knowledgeable. He answered all my questions and was very helpful. He ordered the needed part and it came in quickly and was out to install it quickly as well. It was a pleasure working with your company and staff. They should be commended for a job well done. Your company is lucky to have a great staff.<//review>

Technician identified problem with the compressor of my Whirlpool GB2FHDXWB02. Compressor change was quoted $1038. Their margin seems to be on the high side, so naturally I am purchasing a new fridge for the cost of their compressor replacement.</Review>

<Text>Tha actually company was very bad. Had to make several useless appointments since pre COVID-19 where a technician would come out without parts or the company would not understand the service needs. Also lots of back and forth between best buy and appliance repair on who would handle service. But this last technician I believe John was awesome came out figured out the issue and made the right rescheduled appointment. The technician is the only reason for 4 stars.< /Text>< user>

This is the third time I have had to call this particular service contractor out for repairs on my new Maytag Washer & Dryer.  The first visit, EVERYTIME, is to just order whatever part is necessary to complete said repair.  However, the second appointment is usually to install and repair the broken appliance but if the dryer or washer are in the way and you need help disconnecting the appliance that is in the way of the one that needs repair; FORGET IT.  They are quick to leave without repairing anything at all stating that "it should've been ready when we got here." I am a single,  working Mom and I dont know how to properly disconnect my natural gas line and given the danger of the situation;  I would prefer some assistance.  The appliance repair technicians have refused to help me stating that "we cant" and walked out on me leaving me to figure it out on my own.  Compassion and assistance would be really helpful in their profession, dont you think?< /text>

My original service time was cancelled and I had to chose another day. Then when service technician got to my home my son told him I was on my way and he left. I called to see if they could send him back out and they said no and re-scheduled me for a week out. The office personnel were rude the manager was unhelpful and arrogant. I would not use this serve ever!</Text>

This company was chosen for me as my appliance needing repair was under warranty from Lowe's. The complete process was very very frustrating, to say the least, and took over a month. The company was not responsive to emails and/or phone calls. Incorrect iparts were ordered twice. On the third attempt the manager asked for me to pay the shipping (which I did) to expedite the repair and it still took over a week to get a call to schedule an appointment. Manager attempted to blame all on COVID, however, the nice repair man who came to do the repair stated otherwise.  I would unfortunately not recommend this company.<//text>

The technician is very polite. But my washer still not working properly.  He came, Wednesday, 7/8, he indicated there nothing wrong of the washer, but the washer should be plug into the GFCI outlet. We did follow his instruction not to plug the washer into GFCI outlet. It washed few loads, then the same issues/error code appeared again. I immediately call the Appliance Repair number back on Thursday, no answer, left voicemail no call back.<//review>

<review>Danny arrived to fix a dishwasher that had just been repaired but would not heat the wash water or dry the dishes when through washing. Before pulling the unit from the cabinet he put it in diagnostic mode found out what the problem was and the solution.  He was able to reset the washer from the front panel in just a couple of minutes.  I as impressed.  He obviously is quite skilled in the repair of Whirlpool and Kitchen Aid dishwashers.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

These guys are awesome. I was concerned about a noise my refrigerator was making and these guys sent two different specialists out to me to reassure me that my refrigerator was working properly which gave me teh peace of mind I needed. Great customer service. Strongly recommend.< /text>

< Review>
Danny showed up according to the scheduled time. When I let him in he stated that he was there to work on my dryer. I corrected him and told him it was the dishwasher that needed to be looked at. He again said that he was there for the dryer. I again told him that it was my dishwasher that the service call was set up for. My dryer works fine, but my dishwasher doesn't. At that point he said that I would need to get authorization for the dishwasher and prepared to leave. I asked him if he also worked on dishwashers or just specialized on dryers. He stated he also did repairs to dishwashers, but I would need to get authorization and set up a new appointment. I told him that this appointment was set up for the dishwasher. Rather than letting me call to clear this mix up he started to leave. So I asked him point blank, So you can work on my dishwasher, but are not going to. He said yes. I asked him if he had a business card, he stated no, that he gave them out earlier. This is only my opinion but he seemed happier to be able to leave and not work rather than work on the job that he was sent to. So in a sense I wasted my morning waiting for a repairman to show up and tell me that he wasn't going to look at my not working appliance. I think the proper way that this should have been handled is once he knew about the mix up would be to call his shop so we could clear the mix up. I could have showed him my warranty, he could have gotten clearance on his end and my dishwasher could be on its way to working again. Now I have had to reschedule another service call and pray that the person who shows up will actually fix (even look at) the appliance that is broken.< /Review>

Fixed my fridge, but when reinstalling parts, knocked out all my fridge ceiling lights and upon calling them back wasn’t able to get a technician back out same day to reconnect the lights. Or the supervisor didn’t come the next day either. Receptionist kept insisting that I call warrantech the warranty company to call them for another service call for a problem they caused in the 1st place. Still haven’t heard back from company and am awaiting my repairs.<//review>

Stephen was very helpful in checking out our fridge. He also gave us advice of how to clean our fridge so that it can last longer. Stephen gets a 5 star from us, but the overall service I rate a 4 star. The reason being is that I requested a certain time shift and the associate I spoke with confirmed that I was scheduled for that time slot. However, then I received an email with a different time slot, which caused me to change my plans for the day because I had an appointment as well. That was my only issue. Double check your time and write down the name of the associate in case there is an error in the planning.<//text>

Jonathan was very knowledgable and gave me all the information I needed to be informed about how my washing machine works. He was very honest, straight forward, and addressed all my concerns. He was also very respectful and inspected my washing machine thoroughly. Overall Jonathan was great.<//review>

<UserId.>112137373397611730056< /UserId.><user_name>Raymond Soto< /user_name><review>I have never worked with a more unprofessional company in my life.  The lack of respect displayed by the mechanic to the internal manager.  Very poor customer service!!! They do not care about the customers schedule and expect you to be grateful for their employees doing their job even if the job was not performed.   I (the customer) was scolded by Robert Duran, ARS supervisor, because I did not acknowledge that their mechanic went out of their way for me.  Not sure if you consider a mechanic coming to my home 2 times and not fixing the problem due to negligence and lack of knowledge then refusing to come a 3rd time to finish the job.
Seriously, how does one give an incorrect diagnosis 3 times!  Meanwhile I have been without a refrigerator for nearly 1 month due to long wait times and negligence by ARS.
My brand new refrigerator breaks down; I call ARS and have to wait on hold for an hour;  wait 1 week for a mechanic to come to my home; pay $115 for a diagnostic test which was incorrect on 3 separate occasions; then get treated like I am the problem because I ask questions.
I have left 2 messages for the manager, Rich Sitton, to call me but I have not received a call.<//review>< date>

My service was scheduled through KitchenAid. I was told that Appliance Repair would be at my home on Monday. I called Appliance Repair Monday morning to confirm and they said they couldn't come until Thursday. On Wednesday they called to say they had to order a part and so wouldn't be there until the following Tuesday. When they finally showed up, the work was done quickly and professionally. No problems with my fridge since.<//text>

ARS sent a technician for refrigerator repair from an extended service plan through Home Depot. Working with the managers of the extended service plan was rather time-consuming and overly complex with a couple of miscommunications that delayed assigning a technician to my case. However, all of that was entirely on the side of the service plan management, and not at all the responsibility of ARS. Once the ARS technician took on the work, all was smooth, with effective communication of clear and realistic timeframes for inspecting and assessing the problem and then following up with the needed repairs.< /review>

<Review>Erick was very efficient and friendly. I've had a rather unfortunate time with my refrigerator since purchasing it 6.5 years ago but it was nice that Erick was able to identify the problem right away, get the parts ordered, and provide me with a small to do list (move food to one side of the fridge and have some towels ready) that would make the repair quick and easy. Appliances not working is never fun but Erick made the repair a good experience.< /Review><resp>None</resp><user_id>117570728086581423940<//user_id><name>Stefanie Ray< /name>< date>

On 12/27/19, I called for a refrigerator cooling issue. A serviceman was sent to diagnose the problem. He checked the refrigerator and said that everything seems to be working fine except that the refrigerant was low. He could recharge the refrigerant for $400 but it is a 50/50 chance it works. Everything seemed to work. We left for vacation on 1/1/2020 but when we came back on 1/5, the refrigerator was not working. Everything was thawed and warm. I called on 1/6/2020 and the serviceman came back out. He checked the refrigerant and STATED THAT IT WAS FULLY CHARGED so the compressor must have went out. It would cost $1500 to replace. The fridge only cost $1000. I said no thank you and immediately contacted Whirlpool and scheduled an appt. with an authorized tech. He checked the refrigerator on 1/11/2020 and said that THE REFRIGERANT WAS COMPLETELY GONE! And that since this is a completely enclosed system, the only way freon is lost is because of a leak and added that everyone who works on refrigeration should know that.  Imagine my surprise and anger that I was misinformed and misguided by the previous technician. I AM OUT $400. I talked to management and they refused to offer any  amount of refund on the bill in order to satisfy my frustration. Always, always call the authorized tech for your appliances. Stay away from these "specialists"

UPDATE: THEY OFFERED TO REFUND 50%OF CHARGE. I ACCEPTED AND HAVE CHANGED RATING TO 3 stars.</Review>

Tom was awesome! We had a little hiccup with our new fridge and he came over to take a look. He explained everything very clearly and went the extra mile to make sure everything was taken care. Thanks for being so professional, sir!< /Review>

When we discovered a problem with our appliance (refrigerator), we were able to get an appointment with Appliance Repair Specialist quickly for a repair specialist to look at the refrigerator.  Patrick (Repair Specialist) was very knowledgeable and familiar with the refrigerator.  Patrick was very professional and courteous. He solved the initial problem, but when he inspected the refrigerator, another issue was found.  This issue was quickly resolved too.< /Text>

I had no problem with the technician that actually did the repair work, the problem I had was with the lack of communications with the office and getting the parts in.  Other than that the technician was 5 stars.<//Review>

This was my second time having Jesus come to my house to deal with an issue with my Whirlpool dishwasher (totally unrelated issues).  Both times he went above and beyond to try and help;  the company is easy to schedule with and clearly cares about customer satisfaction.  I wouldn't hesitate to call them for any future need.<//text>

James McMicken was super good at his job. Everything was done quickly, leaving no mess and he informed me of everything he did and what I should expect. Just a really efficient young man as well as courteous and made me feel very comfortable with the work that he did. He showed up on time and I would definitely refer this appliance repair business to anyone.</Text>

<text>John was on time, efficient and very knowledgeable.
He installed the new part and the refrigerator is working very well.
John moved the refrigerator back into place.
He informed us on what he did and explained the refrigerator needed 24 hours to come to operating temps.
We would request John for any of our appliances requiring service.<//text>< Pics>

Repair tech came and sat in his truck for over 5 minutes while my wife stood in the driveway waiting for him to acknowledge her.  In and out quick with the diagnosis.  Now stuck waiting for them to return to do the repair.  There has been poor communication on timing for the repair and we are going on 3 weeks with a broken freezer.Not impressed with service or customer care.</text>

They put you on hold for extended periods of time.  They do not listen to you regarding your problem (which led to the wrong part being ordered and costing me another 3 weeks of down time), the call center operator girls (EXCEPT JENNY) are rude, curt, and snarky.  Chase showed up 40 minutes late to my first appointment with him and then informed me that he needed to order the correct part.  When this part finally came in, he did show up on time the second time however...I had to walk out and ask him to park in a parking spot instead of in the alley which blocked through traffic and our garage.  He was here before so I'm not sure why he needed this instruction.  He replaced the part, the unit is working again.  Was it worth the stress, the frustration, my time, and worth being treated so rudely?  Their customer service is sorely lacking and that is a real shame.  This company was contacted via the home improvement store that sold us the freezer and with the unit being broken under the warranty time, they pick the repair company.

I would never 'choose' to call this company for help, not ever.<//Review></record>

Would not accommodate the 1 hour period of the day I could not be there.
Did not fix the problem. He borrowed my wife's blow dryer and blew the seal for a minute and said it's fixed and left.
It was not fixed.
It started icing up again immediately. Not okay for a 1 month old Whirlpool Freezer in my opinion.
I'll try service call again but getting ready to just return it if this is the way they handle defective products.</Text>

Izzy, is a superb example of service. He came to repair my kitchen-aide dishwasher on time and with all the parts needed. While here, he gave me tips on how to get dishes even cleaner .   Such a nice demeanor, and so knowledgable.< /text>

Francisco repaired my freezer.  Overall, great service.  He called prior to arriving to let me know on his way, when he arrived, he was courteous, he explained what he was doing and how long it would take.  My unit is still under warranty and I received great service from Francisco and he followed up with a call to make sure everything was working properly.< /text>

Specialist came all the way from L.A. basin  and instantly knew what the problem with the dryer was, got the appropriate parts from the truck and had them installed in less than half an hour. He pointed out a maintenance issue I need to look into to prevent the problem from recurring. Very knowledgeable,  swift, and arrived exactly on time.<//text>

Ceasar the service tech was punctual, friendly, and courteous. The repair did not take long and he was very through in explaining the problem and the  remedy to fix it. He also gave additional information  about the products that had purchased a they were brand new.
I asked him some additional questions about the appliances and he seemed all to happy to answer any questions that l had and how to get the best out them. He also gave me warranty information that was very helpful. Highly recommended.<//Text>

The technician was chatty and pleasant and replaced 3 parts in our refrigerator but after 24 hours and now two different repairs our refrigerator continues to freeze all produce even when the thermostat indicates it's over 40 degrees in the produce section. The thermostat is not accurately reflecting the temperature inside the refrigerator and this is extraordinary frustrating. I feel as though we might have a lemon Appliance.<//Review>

<Review>I contacted Appliance Repair Specialists through the Kitchenaid website.  My refrigerator was not cooling properly.  Their response to my website service request was very quick and they were able to send our a Technician within a few days.  I was very happy about the response time.

The Technician who showed up did not seem that familiar with refrigerators/refrigeration.  As soon as he walked in the door he was on the phone talking with another Technician and describing my issue to them.  it was pretty clear he was simply following their recommendation, and not diagnosing the issue himself.  The technician on the phone told him it was likely the coils were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  I didn't think that was the issue, but I had a feeling his experience wasn't going to allow him to diagnose something deeper than that.  Sure enough, after he left the problem returned.

I called Appliance Repair Specialists back and let them know my issue was not resolved.  They initially said the same Technician would need to come back out to finish the job.  I explained that I was concerned about his level of expertise, but they said it was policy of one Technician to finish the job he started.   I was disappointed, but figured  I would keep going down this path.  Fortunately they called back within a few minutes and let me know they would be sending out a sealed system Specialist instead of the original Technician.  He would be back out to my home in two days.  Again, I thought that was great response time.

Alejandro was the Specialist that showed up, and he clearly knew what he was doing.  He showed up with replacement thermistors and said they were typically the part that caused my issue.  I was pleasantly surprised he was aware of the issue before arriving and had parts with him to try and resolve it.  He replaced the parts and said that if they did not resolve the issue it would most definitely be the circuit board.  Unfortunately the replaced themistors did not correct the issue, so I found a replacement circuit board online and installed it myself (it was a simple plug and play operation).  It's been a few days and the refrigerator has been cooling fine.  Alejandro's diagnosis was 100% correct.

I'm very happy with the response I received to my requests, and everyone was great to work with.  I just wish a more experienced Technician had been sent out the first time and perhaps we could have avoided the additional visit and time it took to fix the issue.<//Review>< Pics>

The Repair Specialist was prompt, highly knowledgeable, polite, explained the process and asked excellent questions to determine what he might need to address first. He was able to identify the issue quickly and make the needed repair quickly. He also took time to explain what the issue was and offer suggestions. If I had a need for repair services again, I would hope the same repair person would be sent. Great Service!<//Text>

The repairman's work was quite satisfactory.  However, the fact that I gave you more than two weeks to "obtain the part" , you called and made an appointment, then didn't show up  --" part hadn't come in" -- was most unsatisfactory.< /Text>

<Review>The repairman was excellent---5 stars+.  However the office staff did not tell me that the time quoted to me, initially, could be changed without notice.  Morever, they did not have my phone number correct--- their excuse for not calling me to tell me of the change.  Competence and efficiency of the office staff is worth only 1 star---hence the above evaluation of 3 stars.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Date>1571891612478< /Date><user_id>112560635316603462462</user_id><Rate>3< /Rate><Name>Judith Heffron<//Name><GmapID>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac<//GmapID><resp>None< /resp></record>

We have been without a refrigerator for 3 weeks. Attempts to repair have failed. Normally takes 7-10 days to get another appointment. Technician was very good so no complaints with him. Just takes too long to get an appointment. When the repair does not fix the problem the company should get someone out within 3 days. Waiting longer than that is unacceptable.<//Text>

Repairman troubleshooting consisted of one quick turn of the washer resulting in an immediate recommendation to purchase a new washer. No effort was made to set validity to its condition other than stating this fact. It seemed suspicion that it was near 5pm and the last job resulted in this manner. Charged us $115 for 10-seconds.
Update: Responded to owner. Left receptionist my contact info for mgmt to return call.<//Review>

<review>Muchhhhhh better than A&R Appliance, the company that was originally dispatched to fix a leak in my stove top under warranty. The tech from Appliance Repair Specialists discovered that a 2 inch crack in the regulator was simply covered with putty that wasn't even rated for gas. In my book, that's a safety hazard to me and my family. That could've been awful. I'll be following up with them soon on that.

But anyways, the tech that responded from ARS, Johnathon....super helpful, polite, and knowledgeable. He didn't have the part right away but he ordered it and had it installed the next week. No issues since. Very pleased with the results.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>We were very happy to have Appliance Repair Specialist service our 4 month old Whirlpool Oven. Thank goodness it was under warranty. The serviceman Chris was very knowledgeable and was able to replace the sensor and motherboard in a reasonable amount time.  Looking forward to an oven that won't shut itself off now - especially with the holidays around the corner. Highly recommend this company. They were able to schedule during the same week that I called - no waiting.  Amazing!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>David was very professional and knowledgeable.  This was the fourth time we had to call a repair company out. The first three repairmen (from other companies) could not identify the issue with our ice maker. After inspecting our fridge David was able to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. Now we have plenty of ice and the unit is back to new!

<Text>I would be rating this company a 1 for no effort they signed for the parts and forgot to give it to Jim (there repair guy) when he had an hour drive to my house. Jim went all out and drove back to pick up to get my hood and stove working. Jim definitely deserved 5 stars< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Tech, Patrick Carraway, knows his job .  Efficient & skilled.  Appliance Repair Specialists' labor rate will make most prospective customers seek help elsewhere.  NOT applying the inital call chrg. of $115 ,as a credit to the overall repair, bill must lose a lot of customers.<//text>

<review>James arrived at approximately 1:20 .M.  He save  me a lot of waiting time as the schedule was to be between 1:00 P.M. - 4:00 P.M.  Shortly after arrival he was able to diagnose the problem with the Ice Maker.  He fixed the problem and had it back in operation in a very short time.  While there, he was very professional, put away everything, left no mess and then left.  I couldn't have asked for better service....<//review></record>

Raymond Herron arrived at the appointed time. Introduced himself and handed me his business card. He quickly inspected our Jenn aire  cook-top. After determining the problem he returned to his truck to retrieve the replacement part. He disassembled and reassembled the cook-top quickly and with confidence that only comes from experience. I don't hope to need another service call, but if I/we do, I hope Raymond is the service rep who arrives to help.< /Review>

Chris McConnell was an excellent representative and ambassador for your organization.  Not only was he the most knowledgeable technician I've yet to meet, he also possesses a professional and ethical demeanor which translates to the customer.  I mean no negatives toward other technicians, but Chris' style put me instantly at ease.  Not only did he repair the issues I was having, I feel 100% confident the issue is solved.  If I were you, I would be thankful employees like Chris McConnell are representing your organization in the field.  I give him five stars,(simply because you don't allow me to more).</Review>

<Review>This specialist showed up in the promised time frame. He took the time to carefully diagnose the problem and solve it by removing a nail that had worked its way through the holes in the washer tub and into the pump that drains the machine after each wash and rinse cycle.< /Review><username>The Weisgreens< /username>< resp>

Technician came in tested the voltage on my outlet said that it was putting out 160 volts instead of 240. How do you get 160 volts from a bad outlet not possible so I had the landlord's electrician check the outlet and we're getting 240v. They even took the dryer to another apartment and plugged it in and it still didn't work call them to let them know what it happened and the man on the phone asked if I had any proof that the outlet was okay even after I shared all of these details with him what the hell now I fear they will charge me $115 for the service call because it wasn't the dryer which it was and I'm going to have to argue some more with people that are so out of touch in their profession and their capacity to understand what customer service is I went down and purchased on my own dime a new door switch for the dryer without any work done to the outlet I replace the door switch and oh my God the dryer came to life to the owners I would submit please either fix the apathy in your service technicians or send people that have the basic skills for the job and then ask your phone people do not demand proof that what I'm saying is true I cannot recommend this service for anybody not anybody sorry you're a no-go if they charge me for that bogus service call I will leave more negative reviews on more review sites oh and refuse to pay for a bogus diagnosis from an incompetent technician thank you that is all</Review>

The service tech( TYLER in my case) that they send you have no idea of what they are doing. The specialist supposedly that came to my house is a senior specialist . He came to  my house and looked at my fridge and told me that I would be better off ordering the extended warranty and wait 60 days and then call for service with them . He DID NOT diagnose or do anything to figure out what was wrong with the fridge. I'm sure they are getting some kind of kick back doing this . Once I found out that the warranty is gonna cost me over $900 I called them back to tell him that I do not want to get the extended warranty and I want the $115 back , he told me that I was the one refusing the charges of the diagnostic and I didn't want to move forward with the repairs he had suggested( ALLL LIES) He never diagnosed or gave me an estimate. These guys are thief and crooks coming to people's homes . He was literally 5 min at my house and he charge $115 to tell me to go ahead and order extended warranty . I will also be making a complaint to the BBB so they can teach a lesson .  Call your local appliance repair companies and you'll save yourself heartache and time .<//Review><Name>Melinda Aghassi<//Name>< UserId.>

<name>Jeff Ravitz<//name><text>Kenneth and Appliance Repair Specialist were really helpful, professional and skilled in getting this repair finished.  Aside from just getting the job done properly, they have a customer-centric system for scheduling their  appointments so the customer has a much narrower window of time that needing to be available for their visit, and then they phone you before they arrive.  That small method for keeping the customer informed and respecting our time goes a long way toward making the process even better.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

The customer service people need to know what customer service means.  They did not call to reschedule an appointment.  I had to call at approximately 1500 hrs, only to find they could not get to me.   They then lied and said that the appointment was for the next day.  They hung up on me twice and would not give me the owners number (Daniel).  They could not give me their LLC, which is, by law, must be on display during business hours.  They, by far, have the worst customer service, or lack thereof, I have ever seen.  They later said, oh, we can't get to you until a week and a half later.  I would like a call from the owner and he should fire all customer service people in his employment.  I will "wait" for his call before going any further with my complaint, and my call to Lowes to complain and possible cancel their contract with your company</Text>

The technician spent probably 10-15 minutes.  Assured me that the problem was fixed.  Same problem persisted after he left.  Wish he would have spent a little more time.  I can't wait another week and sit around for a 4-hour period waiting to come back.  Just going to return to Home Depot.</review>

The tech came to look at the washing machine because of a smell in my clothes after wash cycle. The guy ran a few test on the machine motors and just told me to leave the lid open and use the deep water wash to get my clothes from smelling. I hope that this idea works.<//text>

Jonathan arrived on time, we did receive a call informing us he was on his way.  He was quick to make friends with our dog.  I explained what was wrong with the appliance and his immediate response was something was wrong with the fan.  He actually expected a mouse was trapped in the fan.  When he removed the back to check on the fan, he found the problem.   It wasn't a mouse, but a piece of dampening foam that had come loose during shipping or installation and lodged in the fan.</review>

Appointment Scheduler were polite and had great customer service, technician was rude after having to return 3  times to diagnose our dryer (actually only showed up twice) and failed to advise dispatcher in a timely manner that he would have to order another part and would not show up to check dryer. I had to call to find out if technician was still showing up after appointment time had past and no one had called.< /review>

Dane was friendly and professional!! He got my dryer fixed!! My concern is  not with Dane!! This was the 3rd time in less than a year that this dry has had the same problem!! Dane gave my husband pointers for changing the vent setup!!! Which my husband is going to fix!! But if that doesn't help we need to dig deeper as to what is happening to cause it to break down again!!! Thank You  Bonnie Watkins< /text>

No doubt Technician Tyler Fields is highly
skilled in his field.  He immediately assessed the thermostat and  defrost needed to be replaced in the refrigerator.  Since he did not carry them, he had to order them, and come back on Monday (from his first visit on Wednesday). Tyler came back Monday and installed the parts in less than 20 minutes.   He is knowledgeable and efficient in his job.
Tyler is commendable in his commitment to the customers to finish the job well.
However, unaware of Company policy, wonder why it took that long (reported on 10/21/18, fixed on 10/29/18) to fix the issue.< /Text>

Francisco Sandoval was terrific.  He quickly diagnosed the problem with my dishwasher and had it running smoothly in no time.  He also took the time to explain how use the various cycles to keep my new energy-saver washer running smoothly.  He also made sure that any spilled water was mopped up quickly.  I’m very pleased with the service and technician.  Clearly, they understand how to provide great customer service.  Thank you!</Text>

<text>Cruz was very professional. He got here within the quoted time. He was prepared with the parts and fixed my appliance quickly. He left the area clean and left no  debris. He also was dressed in a professional manner and thanked me when he left. I will call this company again if I need a repair.<//text><rate>5<//rate>< date>

Appliance Specialists ordered the wrong part after KitchenAid had provided that info to them. I had to schedule a second visit, and despite that second visit being a month later, they still didn't order the parts until it was too late and they had to cancel my appointment the day before. I had scheduled it on my one day off.

Appliance Specialists makes no attempt to work with you on schedule. You can request a day, but have no input on timing. They call you the day before and give you whatever window during the day they want, which is very difficult being single and not working near home. After canceling my second visit, on my one day off, because of their mistake, they still couldn't work with me to reschedule at the end of the day, so I had to leave work halfway through the day to meet the technician.</Text>< pictures>

This company is honest, professional.  my oven is 23 years old, and a lot of parts aren’t even available anymore.  Company let me know there may be nothing that could be done to fix my problem. I opted to have the guy come out anyway. Initially looked like the indicated error wasn’t the issue but rather the main memory board for which there would be no solution and I would need to get a new oven. However the specialist took a moment to think and had brilliant idea that it may not be the oven at all but the electrical power outlet. Sure enough, that was the issue.  I like brainy techs. I can still use my oven - for a while!  I absolutely recommend these folks. Good people, thumbs way up.<//Text>

<Review>IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN ONE STAR THIS WOULD BE THE GRADE. APPLIANCE REPAIR SPECIALIST (BAKERSFIELD, CA) Whirlpool Authorized Repair Specialist.

Had JOHN B authorized repair tech come out for an estimate and assessment. John is a very knowledgeable technician and a nice guy. I'd have him do repairs on my washing machine without reservation.

UNFORTUNATELY,  I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR THIS COMPANY.
COMPANY KNEW THAT THEY WERE COMING ON A 'EXTENDED CONTRACT' (by ASSURANT) CONSULTATION FOR ANALYSIS. Assurant knew the cost of repair was going to over cost the value of the contract, so they informed me they needed to do a buyout. But they sent the repair to confirm. When John arrived, told him honestly, I'd most likely have to pay for the repair myself, as a cash non-contract repair. He did a thorough job and written estimate total will be emailed by service company.

GOT THE EMAIL THEY SENT WITH AN INVOICE WITH A "TOTAL TICKET" ESTIMATE. It was very high but, I can’t seem to find a new machine with the right dimensions to fit into the space of the old machine (time has changed dimensions of the ‘newer’ machines). And I can’t change location. So thought I’d do the repair even though it was the cost of a new machine.

Calling the APPLIANCE REPAIR SERVICE company to authorize repair was told estimate was 'incomplete' and other charges in 'comments section' needed to be added to adjust total, and were not included (in written) total, hiking up the cost to $$$$ more than acceptable.  Actually, after reading the ‘comments’ seems items listed on the tag sheet and in the line items, have found they seem to be duplicated. And; Evidently it was forgotten that this was a cash repair.

So the estimate quoted then, is not a 'total' for the repair. Asked why repair co does not send a pre-auth estimate with a formally revised FINAL WORK ORDER with all-inclusive fees I was told, "We should do that, but we don't".

So then, how does one proceed to make an educated decision to repair a better older machine rather than buy a newer model that will not hold up in the long run? And this was notated and confirmed in comments by the repair tech.

Repair company was not pleasant. After multiple rounds asking for what to do on their miscommunication, and 3 different CS reps, Supervisor Robert stated there was nothing he would do, the total cost stands, will be whatever the invoice and comments reflect, even if bottom total is incorrect for not including ALL TOTAL costs in comments.

Asked for some 'reduction' on their mistake, I still want to do the repair,( as cash customer); CS supervisor still refused, ultimately was more rude, told me he “had other customers to help that needed his 'attention' more than me” , told me this incomplete and inaccurate non-quoted items estimate was the final cost,  call back if I wanted to do the repair at this cost, "have a nice day" and hung up.

I spoke to the insurance company, to inform them how rude their recommended repair company was, and, They confirmed the costs quoted were their ‘contracted’ costs.  NOT CASH PRICES.

Final analysis, NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.
THIS SEEMS TO BE A SCAM BY APPLIANCE REPAIR SERVICE FOR DUPLICATE CHARGING, AS WELL FOR CHARGING A ‘CASH’ CUSTOMER THE HIGHER COSTS OF A CORPORATE CONTRACTS PRICING.<//Review>< pictures>

Good communication during scheduling and 20 minutes prior to arrival.  Technician was extremely competent and great to work with.  Technician had parts in truck ready to go when he arrived (no delay to order parts).  Technician was able to handle everything that was thrown at him including paperwork confusion and appliance troubleshooting.  Great experience - will recommend in the future.< /review>

This company came to repair to my Kitchen Aid refrigerator and not only could not diagnose the problem but ordered wrong parts and did not have the proper equipment to do the work.  They came out three times and still failed to repair the fridge.  Their techs were inexperienced, unprofessional and failed to address the repair each time they came out.  And while disassembling the fridge they even damaged the doors.  Repeated calls and requests to their service manager fell on deaf ears.  I would never work with the company!  This is the worst experience I have ever had with a service and repair company. I would encourage anyone who has a need for appliance repairs to look elsewhere because they have no idea how to service a call and resolve repairs.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with them.  They were so bad that the warranty company pulled them from the job and assigned the work to another company in the area.  Do yourself a favor and stay away ... find someone else!<//Text>

GARBAGE! Best buy protection plan sent these clowns out to check my refrigerator 2 x and they didn't fix anything. Tyler the technician didn't even bother testing the refrigerator to see if it's working properly after the second time he came back. Called dispatch and they just gave me the run around. Avoid this company like the recent measles breakout!<//Review>

<Text>The repair tech spent very few minutes assessing the situation, did not do a thorough inspection to diagnose the issue, and did not run the washer through its cycles to know the problem. To make things short the problem was not fixed.<//Text>< username>

<Text>The service person came to diagnose the issue, and charged me for the service call and provided a high estimate, estimate included some parts that IMO were working fine and not needed to be changed. However, when I contacted them they said that since its over a month, they will charge me for another service call on top of the repair cost.  Did not sound that the company care for the customer, I called around and the a reputable company bid half price for service call.  Whirlpool should think about recommending this outfit.< /Text><date>1544659710630</date></record>

Very satisfied with Patrick's service. Patrick is a very likeable person who was very professional. I was very pleased that he quickly diagnosed the problem with my washer, he told me when he would be back to repair it, he was prompt and it didn't take a long time.  Thank you so much Patrick!!<//Review>

<text>Jim/ James was a great technician. Not only did he set to fixing the problem that he was called out for but we spoke for a few minutes sharing our stories.
I felt totally at ease and safe, which is important to me, and more than that, I was confident that the fridge would be fixed- quickly and right!

Technician was knowledgeable, informative, and friendly.  He diagnosed the problem, ordered the part, and returned in two days to complete the repair.  He went the extra mile to check the water line outside.  We are very happy with Appl. Repair Spec.< /review>

Cesar was professional, efficient, located the issue within minutes, fixed the AC, and then checked the unit for any other possible issues.
Excellent service!</review>

Very polite tech with many years of experience. Several months ago, we purchased a brand new dishwasher as we were giving our old kitchen a facelift. We were only able to use it one time and seemed to work intermittently as the dishwasher would run and then stop never completing a full normal cycle. On a recent Saturday morning, loaded dishwasher and 'no power' and noticed a large pool of water in the bottom of dishwasher. As you might imagine, very frustrating...again. Within a few days, the Tech arrived and quickly diagnosed the wiring problem and fixed. So, now will be able to run the dishwasher. Several times, he asked if we had any other concerns or questions he could help us with. We felt very comfortable having him in our home.</Text>

I was not disappointed with the repair person himself.  I am, however, extremely disappointed with the company.  First, we set up at time between 2 and 5, and they called that morning at 9 that they would be there in 30 minutes, I was at work.  Next when I rescheduled for Sat, they cancelled, rescheduled for Mon, they cancelled, finally on Tuesday, from 2 to 5, a worker shows up but with the wrong part, had to wait until the following Sat, for the part.  When getting an extended warranty from Lowe's, double check it is with this company.  I will not be buy any more appliances from Lowe's.< /text>

Used Appliance Repair Specialist to fix error codes on my KitchenAid dish washer.  They were flexible and quick with scheduling a time to visit my home.  Service technician was very respectful, mindful of keep my house clean and very thorough.  He explained what he observed, kind of tests he ran, and causes of the issues.  I highly recommend this company.<//review>

<text>Worst service ever.... Contacted and scheduled an appointment online. Gave them my home and cellular number. They called home number to confirm while I was at work. They never called my cellular number. When I got home and heard the message. I called them back after hours and left a voicemail stating I did want to confirm my appointment for 10/16/18 and was given a window period of 8am to 4pm. I took the day off work and in voicemail even requested for them to please call my cellular number.
I waited all day and they called at 3:34pm on day of appointment to say they had called to reschedule for Wednesday 10/17/18 between 2pm and 5pm. I never received any other call and when I told this to the customer service agent and stated I took the day off work and had waited all day for them. His response was give me one second please and hung up on me. I called right back and got another customer service agent and she said there was nothing they could do. This is not the kind of company anyone should have to deal with and I will be finding someone local as the Kitchen Aid appliance website recommended this company out of Bakersfield. I will find someone local in Fresno with better service and employees< /text>< pics>

<text>I was pleased to have my problem handled expeditiously.  A couple of phone calls and an email set up the appointment and the purpose.  The repairman called just prior to his arrival for specific directions to my home and arrived within the designated time that had been prearranged.  More than that, the problem with my dryer was found and fixed promptly.  The repairman was polite and was clearly familiar with the unit.  Well done!</text>< pics>

Izzy was outstanding!  Took time to trouble shoot then identified that spin cycle drain was clogged.  Tested the spin cycle repeatedly until the drain was clear.  Exceptionally courteous and made sure that we were satisfied with the repair.  Thanks to Izzy, his repair service actually saved us from believing we had to purchase a new washer/dryer unit.
It is rare to find such a conscientious service tech.
Thank you for sending him to us!</Text>

Kevin McKellar of Appliance Repair Specialist was great! He was very efficient, professional and honest. He didn't charge unnecessary charges for his service but gave us a reasonable advise on how we can manage the issue of our refrigerator.<//text>

For the 2nd time Ceasar has come to our rescue. I had been waiting for my washer to be fixed for almost 6 weeks (through extended warranty) with another company. I finally got switched over to Appliance Repair Specialists. Ceasar came out Monday and completed my repair by Wednesday going above and beyond. I will always be requesting Appliance repair specialists from now on.</review>

I had 2 visits regarding my dishwasher repair.  The 1st technician timely ordered the parts, the 2nd technician (of which it took 4+ wks to have him arrive) came, was inattentive, took 2 hrs said he repaired the dishwasher, but said he found a "leak" in a hose from the dishwasher to the house and refused to repair it.  Instead he capped off the water and let me call a 3rd technician to get the device repaired, finally.  Dishwasher under warranty was repaired, but poor customer service.< /review>

<Review>Hector gave me a courtesy call as to how far away he was from my home and also when I could expect him to arrive.  He showed up on time, was very polite, diagnosed the washing machine problem, had the parts on his truck, and resolved my washing machine issues quickly.  Thank you for sending out a reliable and competent technician. I highly recommend this company.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>An appointment was made for Saturday and then confirmed mid week. On Friday we got a call that the Saturday technician couldn’t come and we’d have to reschedule. The man I spoke with on the phone had little empathy for my frustration over having to reschedule.
When another technician, George, came the following week, he was prompt, courteous, and professional. He did a thorough diagnosis of our problem and then gave me a reasonable expectation of when the part that had to be ordered would be installed. George returned as promised and our freezer is working perfectly now.< /Review>< pics>

I recently purchased a home and it included appliances. My washer was not working correctly. I was scared of my first “home repair” being a busted washing machine. Well, Mr. Patrick Carraway made my experience extremely easy. I was unsure of what the outcome would be and he made me feel at ease. Very professional and courteous. I would not hesitate to have another repair done if needed.</review>

<review>Aaron was prompt, polite, and professional. He diagnosed the problem with our dishwasher within 2 minutes, fixed it within 5 minutes, and have us recommendations about how to prevent similar issues in the future. There was no charge since the dishwasher was still under warranty. That being said, if we had further problems we'd pay to have Aaron out to fix it!<//review>< Time>

<review>Tyler seemed uninterested in being at our home to solve the problem with our dryer that we paid a lot of money for. He didn't take our problem seriously and said it was a cosmetic thing (lights not showing as brightly as use to on panel). He just said he'd have to replace the whole panel which would cost around $300.00 and will not be covered by our warranty. He said he would e-mail me a service call receipt. He took my e-mail address and never sent me the service all receipt. This specialist gives your store a bad reputation.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Specialist arrived within set time frame (actually earlier than I expected). He not only checked my dryer but my washer as well. Made some computer adjustments to my washer that showed performance improvement the next time I washed. Advised me of the issue w/dryer, gave me options to get the problem fixed.< /Review>

<text>I still have the same problem with my ice maker not making enough ice. The specialist tried to explain to me that my water valve connection was incorrect however my old refrigerator was making ice with the same connection. I still have the 15+ years old refrigerator and the ice maker is flawless. I am not sure if his diagnostic was correct.</text>< pictures>

Raymond is fantastic.He figured out what was the matter and was very helpful. I hope they appreciate him!  The rest of the company is unbelievably unprofessional and gives 0 customer service. When I asked for specific morning or afternoons they said yes and then scheduled me at the end of the day. When I asked to speak to the owner I was told he doesn't take any phone calls and Crystal would call me back..... I am still waiting for her call a week later! I cannot believe that Kitchen Aid has a contract with these people who are an embarrassment of not returning calls or proper communication. At one point I spoke to 3 different people who all had different explanations why it would take 3 visits to fix my refrigerator and would never accommodate me in any of the visits as far as request time.. So totally disgusted with them.<//review>

<Review>Raymond was super qualified.  He gave me a ton of information that will help me keep my dishwasher running problem-free--hopefully for years to come! UPDATE: I did the treatments recommended.  The dishwasher worked exactly once and then failed again.  I tried to get service to come back and these people said, "You are using too much soap" and refused to come out again.  Did they not talk to Raymond?  Or did he not relate the content of our conversation?  There doesn't seem to be a lot of critical thinking going on here.  Oh, and I didn't even mention how the first guy they sent out told me I was using "too much soap" (which I'm not) and that I should be using an "H.E. dishwasher soap".  Go ahead and look this one up.  There IS no H.E. dishwasher soap.  That's a term used when referring to clothes washers and laundry soap.  This first guy who came out (before Raymond) admitted he didn't really understand why the dishwasher was spewing water all over the place and just decided it would be a good idea to replace the entire tub. Oh-kay...? Not sure how that was supposed to help, but, hey, I'm not the professional, right?  Absolutely do NOT recommend these people.  Oh, and in the many interactions I had with them, I even had one guy start to use a nasty, dismissive tone with me.  I asked to speak with someone else and got someone more responsive, but geez.  Overall NOT a good experience. Unprofessional.  (Except for Raymond.)

Oh, and I forgot to mention how BEFORE I got Raymond, after talking directly to Whirlpool to get them to come back out, the technician simply didn't show up at all at the appointed time.  I called to see if I had somehow missed a call from him and the office said that the technician had ALREADY BEEN THERE and serviced the dishwasher!  Um, I beg your pardon?  I've been here in the house the whole time, waiting, so, no, no technician has been here.  "It says here in the file that this problem has already been solved and the technician says you are using too much soap..."  Seriously???  So, a week later, I got Raymond...and the rest is what you read above.  Ugh.</Review>< Pictures>

It was very inefficient experience to me. The diagnosis could be done over the phone, When the technician came out and checked my cooktop, he just turned on the cooktop and saw the igniter clicking constantly, which I told them over the phone and requested to get the job done at the visit. But the technician left without any job done. It would have been done, if the technician came in more prepared with the parts.

There was someone said that they didn't charge the service call fee on their review(giving this company 5 stars), but they did to me.

The quote was a bit unreasonable, so decided to look into fix it myself. It took me 30 mins to figure out how to fix it(by watching YouTube video) and actual repair time. This company made me a little handier.

My advise to anyone with the appliance problem is, if you are a little bit handy, try to fix it yourself. There are so much resources out there. It will save you a good money as well.(it cost $70 for the part, instead of paying this company $380)</review>

<rate>1</rate><review>I wish I could give 0 stars. First of all I have no confidence in their ability to diagnosis and repair appliances. If they show up the tech will not have any parts for your appliance. Kitchenaid replaced the faulty refrigerator and sent a bill of lading to us on 10/31/19. Did not hear anything from Appliance Repair Specialists. Nothing, zip, nada. We call them and they schedule an appt for the following week with delivery time between 10 and 2. When 2:00 arrives I call them, and now the delivery time is between 2 and 6. So I waited some more. Get a phone call at 6 pm that the refrigerator will not be delivered that day but it will be delivered the following "Thursday or maybe Friday". No phone call again from ARS and when we call them they don't know when it will be delivered but it will "probably be next week". We  call Kitchenaid who cancels the refrigerator from ARS and sends a new one via JB Hunt. We promptly get an email from JB Hunt for delivery on Thursday 11/14/19. This morning ARS arrives with the refrigerator with their "techs" to install. I explain to the "techs" the situation and they seem confused. Do not use this company! They will charge you and then jack you around! They have no intention of fixing your appliance they just want the $115 service call fee. They do not have any credibility or integrity.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac< /gmapID></record>

The technician simply came out, told my wife that the problem was due to an unbalanced load (despite me indicating previously that it doesn't work properly even when washing just one set of sheets, when it used to wash 3 sets without a problem), then charged a service fee and left.  NOTHING WAS FIXED.  Now we have to make arrangements for a return visit<//review>

Dane was Very nice and courteous. He was also Very apologetic that what he had replaced,  didn't completely fix my appliance.  I am sure that if I have any issues with any of my appliances, I  will be calling  Appliance Repair Specialist.

Thank you, Dane.

<text>The technician was very professional and polite.  However the dispatch and scheduling from your company was ridiculous.  We scheduled an appointment for a Tuesday only to have a robo call occur two days later saying our appointment had been set for Monday when nobody would be home.  For our second appointment, the same problems occurred.  Very frustrating.< /text>< Gmap_id>

They did a great job. They were called through my home warrantee company after the first vendor didn't fix the problem. Irvin did a great job, communication throughout the process was excellent, they arrived when they said they would and he spent extra time to make sure the repair was done properly.<//Text>

Initial response for evaluation of oven not heating above 200 degrees was within a couple days of my call. The part that the technician needed for the repair somehow did not get ordered. After 2 weeks it arrived and was installed.  The oven still didn't work. It was then determined that the part now needed was no longer available for my 12 year old range. $230 dollars later, I get to go out and buy a new range. It would have been nice if initial check had found the defect in the unavailable part. I could have saved the cost of part not needed and the second service call.</Text>

Washing machine leaking inside after wash cycle completed. Maytag chose this business for warranty repair service,   (even though washing machine was just over a year old and out of warranty - good job Maytag). I live in Southern California, no where near the address given for Appliance Repair Specialist in Bakersfield). Appointment was set. The day before, Appliance Repair called and said they were "overbooked" and re-scheduled for a few days later, between 8am and 10am. No show and at 10:30am we called and they said they were "overbooked" and would be out soon. Tyler came about an hour later. He was polite and fast. Came in and checked a computer code, said it needed a new valve which he doesn't carry on the truck and he made another appointment a couple of days out. He was gone in less than 5 minutes.

On the day of the repair, Tyler came in, changed the valve, and was gone in less than 5 minutes. The next day we noticed our carpet in the hallway behind the laundry room was soaking wet. One of the hoses was leaking just behind the connection to the washer. I turned the water off and my wife called Appliance Repair and told them. They said they are "overbooked" but because they had just been out they would bump us up and send someone the next day.

Tyler came out the next day. Looked at it, checked the connection and said it was tight, and said the hose failed, it's not part of the washer and not covered by the washer warranty. He said he did remove the hoses before replacing the valve and re-connected them. He said it wasn't leaking when he left. Obviously it was. It was not leaking before the service. We did not call for service because the hose was leaking, it only started leaking after the service and not 2 or 3 weeks later, but immediately. I asked Tyler if he could replace the hoses, but he couldn't because they don't carry hoses on the truck. I'm not sure what kind of appliance repair doesn't carry parts or even hoses. Tyler did say that they recommend stainless steel hoses for installations inside a house and not the rubber ones that were on it. He said those were probably on the previous washer before the new one was installed. (They were not. They were newly installed at the same time as the washer and Tyler didn't say anything about the hoses the day he replaced the valve. He didn't even say "We're overbooked and I have not even 1 minute to wait and see if this is leaking, so you might want to check it yourself to be sure it's not leaking"). Tyler was gone within about 3 minutes.

I called a water damage repair service. They measured moisture in the walls several inches up from the floor. They pulled up the carpet, removed the wet padding, sprayed a liquid to keep anything from growing, and put a fan under the carpet to try and dry everything out. They will return in a couple of days to check for mold and evaluate the damage to the drywall. The extent of the damages is not known yet.</text>

<Text>Repairman who showed up at the house to look at ice maker issue was very polite but inexperienced and had to Facetime with someone at a remote location to try and guess at the problem. They guessed wrong. Now I am $395 in to a total misdiagnosis. Waiting to hear back all day from a supervisor on how they propose to address this matter....</Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< GmapID>

I would give a zero, if I could. Specialist came 3 times to my place and fix the initial problem. That took them 8 months!!!!!!!! After replacing door improperly in refrigerator, door stopped closing automatically. I didn't have this issue in the beginning. After I called them and told about that few weeks later, specialists came and "fix" . After "fixing service"  the door still doesn't work. When I called them today, they want me charge $115 to come and check it!!!!!!  So they BROKE my refrigerator door and WANT me to PAY for their INCOMPETENCE. If you have expensive appliances NEVER NEVER use their services. They don't have idea about repairing or customer services.<//Text>

<text>Sheryl Heidt is the best speech pathologist I have had worked with.  She does an amazing job with children and adults.

I worked in the public school system for 23 years and observed numerous speech pathologists in a school setting.  Often times, students were put in small groups with an aide to do the therapy.  At Effective Speech Therapy, Sheryl works one on one with her client.

Our granddaughter had severe apraxia of speech which is a motor planning deficit.  She was 85% unintelligible throughout kindergarten.  She desperately wanted to play with other children, but was unable to even speak her name and had to have it written on a paper to introduce herself.  Sheryl worked tirelessly with our granddaughter.  We had scheduled appointments and she notified us immediately if there was a cancellation so that we could get additional treatments.  Therapy started and finished on time; no time was wasted in a waiting room.

Sheryl is a phenomenal diagnostician and treatment was adjusted throughout our granddaughter's therapy sessions to help her meet her full potential. Sheryl worked on motor skills with her regarding mouth and tongue formation, air movement in the mouth and nose, and the pitch and volume she used when speaking.  Sheryl also worked on social cues and the ability to read body language and interact with other children and adults.

Sheryl has a wealth of knowledge and a variety of interventions to use.  I was able to talk with her about the previous week's challenges and she was able to weave that information into the therapy session.  As a result, our granddaughter has finished fourth grade and is one of the top readers in her class.  She had read the series of books titled "A Series of Unfortunate Events;" books rich in vocabulary.  She even earned the first place reading ribbon in her class.  Our granddaughter is social and loves to talk and interact with other children.  Without Sheryl's intervention our granddaughter would have been lost in a public school setting.

Sheryl has also worked with my husband who has an atypical parkinsonism; a diagnosis that leads to speech, language, and cognitive difficulties.  My husband's physician at UCLA has been extremely pleased with the progress he has made with Sheryl.  She has helped him to be able to access his prior language skills using theories of neuroplasticity and the creation of new neural pathways.  She has helped us, as a family, to find ways to communicate with my husband to reduce the stress on him.  She has given him tools to help deal with public situations. Sheryl is not the type of speech pathologist who will open a book to page 33 and next week, you will go to page 34.  She is constantly listening and interacting with you, reassessing and encouraging you.  With her help, my husband's quality of life has been greatly improved.

There are not enough words to describe what a phenomenal speech pathologist Sheryl Heidt is and the lasting impact she has had on our family.  We would highly recommend her for all your speech and language problems.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Service for washer being fixed was actually fine , but I had to make appointment twice because service man was extremely late. Scheduled for 10-12, he came at 4pm and I was not home. Next time he was 2 hours late. It’s a lot to ask a customer to spend so many hours waiting for service.< /Review>< rating>

The tech was ok, not very personable. He told us the new refrigerator door was not covered by warranty or gurantee at all since the overall refrigerator warranty had expired.  We thought that was pretty bogus since the original door broke due to manufacturer defects within the warranty time. However, by the time the new door arrived the warranty expired. So that's it, the new door was installed with zero gurantee. We won't recommend this whirlpool refrigerator to anyone. It also makes a lot of loud noises.< /Text>

Repair specialist was nice and replaced parts as expected.
The reason for the three star rating is the refrigerator ice maker, after 4 repairs, still does not work. The refrigerator has had problems since we bought it. First the water dispencer did not work, then the ice maker did not work and has not worked for any extended period of time since its first repair. The refrigerator is now out of warranty. I feel like we got a lemon.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Horrible Horrible. They were a nightmare to deal with. I had been waiting for over 2 weeks for a minor fix to the drawer rail. They kept giving me stories about their employees not coming out on scheduled time. SO UNPROFESSIONAL!  showed up after my scheduled time frame when I was no longer available & never giving me the protocol courtesy call ahead. It was the same story for over 3 days that i had to take off from work to squeeze them in.  So sad for the business owners that this is how their employees are functioning.</Review>< pics>

THe technition was great but did not fix my fridge. The call center wehen calling in is horrible. They are rude and unprofesional. THey wanted to charge for a second work order to fix the first work order because they did not fix the issue in the first place. Seems like bait and switch. Also I called AHS and they said that this compnay did not even send them any paperwork after the they came out.< /Text>

<text>I was SO pleased with the service I received from Kenneth when he came to my house to repair my microwave.  He arrived when he said he would and he was able to order the part and install it in less than a week.  I'm thrilled.  I will recommend Appliance Repair Specialist to everyone I know who needs their appliance repaired,  and of course, I will only call them if I need help again.

Thank you for such an incredible experience.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac</gmap_id></record>

Tech said it was an electrical problem, not dishwasher.  Which was correct.  I needed to call an electrician.  The electrician found that the GFCI had tripped and just needed to be reset.  The service tech should have checked that.<//Text>

<name>Ken BeachCynic< /name>< Review>
I invested hours of time for a 10-minute service. first appointment, the guy diagnosed the problem in minutes & advised that he would have to order a part that they used to keep on hand because this was a common problem. told him I had an afternoon off in 2 weeks & he could come back then.  on that day, I got a voicemail message in the morning that he was waiting outside.  unfortunately I was not home as I had the _afternoon_ off. called them back & arranged a Saturday appointment a few weeks later.  I received a robocall the day before confirming the appointment and another the next day saying he was on the way ... and no one showed up.  the following Monday I call them.  they don't have the part.  it had been returned & they don't know why I received the calls.  they have to order the part again & they give a a.day but the manager cannot say what time the appointment will be.  I will have to waste a 4th day waiting on the repair.  another robocall to confirm.  on the day, a human calls with an updated ETA ... 2-hours past that ETA, as I am just about to call them _again_ they show up. 10-minutes later repair is complete & he's gone.  so they put in 10-minutes at each end and i invested about 20-hours to get it done.  terrible.<//Review>

Technician failed twice to diagnose and repair problem. We told this tech that the problem might be in the rails and he completely ignored us. I wish we were able to leave stellar reviews like others have but unfortunately this was not the case.
I have a video of the behavior of the technician while he was in my house that speaks for itself. I will upload it to YouTube when Whirlpool finishes processing our claim. They are sending an “out off area “ technician to repair the freezer since this company failed twice.<//text>

Their manager is the worst manager I have ever encountered, they send a technician to fix my problem and say it’s fixed. The first load of laundry I do and I get the exact same error message again. Call to have them come back and actually fix the problem only to get nothing but a run around, then asked to speak to the manager who was rude and obnoxious. Will never deal with this company again, and hope that Lowe’s will cancel their contract! their manager is the worst manager I have ever encountered, they send a technician to fix my problem and say it’s fixed.

<Review>I was so upset seeing this company had only 2 stars for their score, but when i called in a was treated with respect and Josh did everything he could to help me out. He even went above and beyond to call other part places to get me faster service. They were back out in 2 days to make the repair on my washer and it works better then when i got it. I called back in and spoke with a guy named Albert who told me the company was under new management and that he was happy I was taken care of. I dont know what happened with these other guys, but my experience was awesome -< /Review>< userid>

I rarely give poor reviews, but I cannot have one other person go through the experience I had with this company. The repairman named Raymond is the most Insensitive, cold and completely lacks in any empathy of what customer is going through.

I bought brand new refrigerator Whirlpool model number WRS588FIHZ over $1200 from Best Buy with a 3 year warranty, which stopped working under the first year warranty.
Since is was still under the 1st year warranty through Whirlpool they had to try to fix first.

After repairing the freezer, 2 days after the freezer was showing same problem he came out for, and the added bonus of the  ice maker no longer working, the refrigerator part was not cooling. And the same problem was happening again. This is now week 3 no refrigerator.
I called the appliance company again who services Whirlpool refrigerators and when Raymond came in to see what was wrong,  he was perplexed within 48 hours the refrigerator is frosting over again, his response was...to order a door which would take another 6-8 weeks to order the door, he said maybe that could be the problem and admits the temperature part did not fix the issue. Now it’s  obvious this is the real problem  temperature  regulator cannot be fixed.
I got the feeling he was just guessing what the issue could be, even though the seal on the door had very strong suction . He never even attempted to fix the ice maker after it went out from his fix on the freezer, which was a real definite issue he caused. Since I was still within the first year warranty, they could not charge me. Running up the bill for Whirlpool until he runs out of options, while the customer suffers through weeks without a refrigerator.

At this point I’m crying and pleading I cannot go another 6-8 weeks not having refrigerator, he gave zero options. I said what happens if that doesn’t work?   He shrugged his shoulders, I don’t know.
I’m now emotional wreck and he says well if you’re going to act this way I’m going to leave.

I finally called Whirlpool I could barely speak because I was so emotionally drained and crying from this  ordeal and the woman who took my call said give me 5-10 minutes. She came back and said we are going to send you a new refrigerator. She said she was going to put a stop to any further repairs. I finally felt heard, the woman at Whirlpool listened and fully understood what I was going through.

Albert the scheduler from  Appliance Repair Specialist was the only one from the repair company that seemed to care.

But Raymond the repair-man should be terminated  because he gives Whirlpool a bad name. Even as a 3rd party repair company for Whirlpool they have to go through protocol check off list. There should be some sensitivity toward customers through no fault of their own, a few options to at least get a temp refrigerator until they deem it I un-fixable.

Be warned Anyone who calls this company if they send Raymond immediately take action to replace him, or go to another appliance company that Whirlpool contracts with. I could not believe that he could walk out that door knowing the next fix is 6-8 weeks which was a guess on his part and not having a second thought of what is was putting through.

Raymond  was completely unsympathetic and heartless toward me  having to wait another 6-8 weeks. Even though I had a 3 year warranty from Best Buy, who was ready to give me a new refrigerator, they had to hear from Raymond that it all unfixable.

Justice would be well served if Raymond experienced what it feels like to be in this type of position.

Try to imagine yourself without a refrigerator for 9-to-11 weeks???

Thank you<//text>

< Review>
Ethan Shrum Scamed me out of $ 115.00 charging me
for a service call that should have been covered under
my warranty.   He asked me to make my check out to him
for $ 115.00, so I did.  I called Whirlpool and they told me
that I should Never Ever pay the Service Repair person.
I put a Stop Payment on my check.<//Review>

First call I held for 5.5 minutes and was disconected. Called back and held for over 7 minutes. When they finally got on the phone the lady on the phone had no clue how to address my repair. Simple, dryer with no heat. She did know that, just to send a tech to evaluate it would cost $125.00. Anything after that is $125 per hr. + parts. Thats a bit rich for me.< /review>

Cesar was prompt, very professional and very knowledgeable. Based on my description of my dishwasher's problem he quickly diagnosed the problem and identified a wiring problem that could create a hazard.

My dishwasher is back in use and the problem is corrected and hazard eliminated. I would recommend Cesar and his company to anyone that has an appliance problem.</text>

Put in a service request in September and our oven is still not fixed after several appointments with the technician. We've been waiting 2 weeks to even get our call to a manager returned. Thanksgiving is coming and looks like we won't have our oven working. We feel very let down.<//Text>

He was on time, and thorough! Checking outlet and breaker, then finding out the dryer wasn't our problem! I love their service technicians!</Review>

<Text>Kenneth Moore was knowlegable, professional, and personable. After several service attempts by four different service technicians to fix a clearly defective refrigerator he informed me of CA's Lemon Law. I was finally able to get resolve with the manufacturer after four months without a working refrigerator, endless delays, and nothing but road blocks from them. So grateful to finally put this mess behind me.< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
The evaporator fan motor went out on my three year old Whirlpool refrigerator. I had to take two days off of work in order to get it fixed because Whirlpool doesn't have a repair person in Simi Valley, they had to send someone from 40 miles away. The first day I waited from 9:00 to after 12:00 to meet with the technician, and then I had to wait another six days before the motor was replaced even though it was in stock two days after the first visit. My family had to live without a refrigerator unnecessarily for over a week. Next time I will call someone local, and not from Whirlpool. And, I will never buy another Whirlpool. My last refrigerator lasted over 20 years before breaking.< /review>

<Review>This visit was on time, they man was clean and efficient.  He heard the high pitched sound from my Whirlpool top freezer refrigerator, and told me it was normal and nothing can be done, at all, other than getting rid of it, putting it in my garage, muffling it with sound blocking material, building a cabinet around it.  This is because they are now using energy efficient compressors that make high pitched sound on these lower end units.  I am sad that I got rid of my old Amana.  Do not purchase anything these days until you hear it running.  With this I turn off the fridge and turn it on when I leave the house to cool and make ice, because I have a brand new ICE BOX not a refrigerator I want to live with in my own home.  I give Whirlpool 5 stars (and other symbols on the keyboard too) thank you for granting me with this horrible thing I cannot live with but you will not return, or even give me credit for on another unit.</Review>< Pictures>

Easy to book the appointment, the office worked with me on scheduling around my tricky work schedule.  The technician Danny was on time, professional, and polite and clean  He thoroughly explained what he was going to do and the possible outcomes of the diagnosis.   He took the time to show me exactly what was causing the issue.  When he removed the broken part, he gave it to me to look at, and showed me a replacement part so I could see it was brand new, still sealed in the original packaging.    When the job was finished and he was leaving he told me run a couple of loads of laundry to be sure all was in good order-he gave me his cell number to call if there were any problems.    I would use this company again if I need another appliance repair, and I would certainly recommend them.<//review>< Resp>

Technician misdiagnosed the problem with my washing machine and won't refund me the diagnostic fee of $85 I paid. My 3 year old Maytag washing machine started giving me an error code of F51. I called and scheduled an appointment for repair. The technician named Andrew arrived on 9/28/13. He diagnosed the machine as needing a new rps sensor kit. He said he would have to order the part on Monday. I paid the $85 diagnostic fee and told him I would let him know Monday if I would go ahead with the repair. He told me either way he was ordering the part because these go out all the time. He emailed me an invoice for $195.74 for the repair to be completed not including the $85 I already paid for the diagnosis. Monday morning 9/30/13 at 8am I called back to let them know that I would go ahead and move forward with the repair, there was no answer. I called back at 10am and asked when they could come back to repair the machine. The girl said she didn't know, but she would call me back and let me know. By 4pm Monday I still have heard nothing. I start looking for another repairmen. I found a number for Quality Appliance Repair Services. The owner, Mike answers and I tell him the diagnosis from Appliance Repair Specialists. He picks up the rps sensor kit locally and is at my house by 5pm. He lifts the machine tightens a bolt that came loose, ran the machine and it works fine no more F51. He told me he's never had to replace and rps sensor on a Maytag. I call Appliance repair Specialists and speak to Erica about a refund for $85 I paid because it was not diagnosed properly. She says that her supervisor is on vacation and won't know anything until they get back. She goes on to say that there's no way I will get a refund because the technician did his job. I believe if he did his job it would have been fixed 9/28/13, when he came out. I feel completely ripped off by this company and don't know how they are in business treating people this way.<//Text>

[4].  WE HAD TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK UNTIL HE RETURNED TO FIX THE DISHWASHER.

THEY ARE A DISSAPOINTMENT DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. They REPEATEDLY rescheduled me multiple times but somehow my appointment didnt make it in the system this happened 3 times already! I put my job in jeopardy by leaving working in the assigned time frame but no technician would show up. If I can rate them no stars i would. On top of rescheduling the one time they did show up HE HAD THE WRONG PART. soooo frustrating.</review>

Not to mention being on hold 10 minutes or more each time you call. nobody wants to take ownership for anything and just passes blame. Good luck to you if you try them.< /review>< pics>

A waste of time when you show the guy who is supposed to be an expert on the product the things it is doing wrong and other problems and they tell you nothing is wrong with the machine and blame the operator for the issues.

This is typical as they are not trained to diagnose but only read a computer code. If it isn’t something captian obvious could see, they won’t.

I think they do this on purpose so they can get another service call fee.

So I now have to find another company.<//text>

<text>Used them in the past and was satisfied with the experience, but the last time will have me looking elsewhere for service.

The technician made a quick and simple repair, just had to replace a faulty refrigerator control panel. He didn't reinstall the lightbulb cover. Now, that alone is more of an annoyance, just sloppiness and poor attention to detail.

However, the unprofessionalism that upset me is that the technician stole the tech sheet which is supposed to remain with the refrigerator, behind the toe panel. ARS was contacted with this information but no response.

Seems like they're hit or miss, not worth the risk.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Bottom line first, he was polite & courteous. The first visit, he came & determined what parts he would need. A fairly quick visit. On the second visit, he didn't make it in the window that was given, & in the time that I was waiting (and getting a lil anxious) I happened to see reviews for this company. I saw some positive ones but mostly negative (as more people like to complain than complement, lol). I began to let the negative comments affect my thinking. When the office called my number looking for him, I started to cop attitude and they let me know that there was an issue with the customer before me and the tech didn't want to leave while the unit was not safe to use. I realized my error & felt compassion for the guy. When he showed up, he never once made comments about the other customer or situation. Never did anything but act professional. Fixed my dryer quickly. I handed him a water bottle & he smiled & thanked me. Sometimes people get their panties in a wad without looking at what is going on from the other perspective. I am sorry that I allowed some "negative nancy's" influence the way I was thinking. The tech was great! The people I spoke to in the office were great! My dryer is working again....which is great!!! Thank you! I hope that someone reads this and it affects their thinking, too! :)</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac< /gmapID></record>

<Text>Terrible customer service all around.
I got an email notifying me of my appointment to have my dishwasher repaired a day ahead of time and I responded to correct their misinformation because it was my double wall oven that needed repairing  ... again - this same company had repaired my oven only 4 months prior and damaged the facing of the cabinets.  Nonetheless, the technician shows up at my house an hour late ready to inspect and diagnose the dishwasher.   They must have internal communication problems or maybe they're just disorganized and unprofessional.  At any rate, the technician said I owed him for the service call, despite the fact that he stayed for 5 monutes and didn't inspect anything.  I refused to pay for such lamesness and called Kitchenaid to request they make an appointment with a different appliance repair company - any has got to better than these jokesters.</Text><user_id>104196090569471677126<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac</Gmap_id><resp>None</resp><rate>1< /rate>< Date>

<review>After the 1st visit on 10/02, 2nd visit on 10/5 and 3rd visit on 10/19,
the technician still could not fix my Whirlpool washer, namely, wet clothe after final spin.
The service were scheduled between Noon - 4:00pm, however the technician came around 5:00pm, and my site manager had to take half a day leave from work to wait him.
The technician spent about 30-minute each time and left.  He was inpatient as he refused to stay to check out if the problem is fixed when my site manager put a load of clothe in the washer to test.  It has been very inconvenient to my site manager as well as my tenants since it has been more than 3-week that 12 households in my apartment complex could not use the washer.<//review>< Response>

Company is very unprofessional.  They were 5 hours late on pick up of my fridge.  This was after they waited weeks to schedule the appoitment.  When the arrived they broke my tile floor when moving the fridge out and before I could come out to stop them they were gone.

I called to have them come out and inspect the damage, they were supposed to call 30 min before and did not so they arrived when I wasn't home leaving my kids to deal with him.

Fernando preceeded to call me a liar, say there was no way they did the damage and that I watched them move it out which was not true.  By the way, the person they sent to investigate the damage was part of the team that did the damage, pretty convenient.

I called the office, the manager would not get on the phone and when i asked for the managers name they put me on hold again.

In my opinion if you value your personal property do not use this company.  Accidents happen which I was ok with but when I am called a liar that is where I draw the line.<//Review>

The technician was great; but the customer service was just terrible.  Hold times on the phone unacceptable, the company unilaterally canceled appointments at the last minute, poor communication between the office and the tech.</text>

I would give Jesus 5 stars, but this service call for which I had to pay was not necessary if someone had read and answered my description of the problem.  I also asked for an approximate cost to repair so I could decide to repair or buy a new cooktop.  Within 10 minutes Jesus found out there are no repair parts available for my cooktop.  So it was wasted money for the service call.<//text>

I had a great experience with Appliance Repair Specialists. My technician Ozzy called ahead and let me know when he was coming. He showed up in a clean van, and was professional and friendly over the course of his visit. He diagnosed the problem with my Maytag refrigerator in minutes and had the needed part in his van. He repaired my fridge in under 20 minutes. While this was a "simple fix" and other repairs may be more involved, I had a great experience and would recommend them for your appliance repairs. Thanks Appliance Repair Specialists!< /review>

First of all, they have repaired my unit three times - apparently correcting their own mistakes each time and failing to generate a permanent fix. I would have already stopped using them, but they are contracted by the company that services my appliance warranty. I am currently lobbying for the end of, or significant amendment to, that contract.

If it would be possible to give only the front office negative stars then I would do that. I have pending claims with Better Business Bureau and the Consumer Protection Agency regarding their practice of sending repair technicians to homes without homeowner consent.

Even worse, I specifically left a message indicating to NOT send a technician to my home and they IGNORED it and sent someone anyway. What sort of business practice is that?< /text>

<text>If I could leave a zero I would. Customer service needs a lot of work because they do not put the customer first. I scheduled an appointment through Whirlpool for some warranty work. When ARS called me they set up the appointment for 8-12. I got a call the next day stating that a technician would be at the house between 12-4. I immediately because upset because I was promised 8-12 because of my work schedule. They called the next morning stating it was between 8-9am. The technician showed up within that hour and was pretty informational on what needed to be completed and/or fixed, but he did not have the parts available because they needed to ordered. He stated that he could book it for Monday (the original appt was Friday). I told him we would be out of town and if they could schedule it for the following Friday morning. He booked the appointment and I got a call the following Thursday stating that someone would be at the residence between 8-9am. Came 9am and nothing. I gave them an extra 30 min because they could possibly be running late. 930am came and still nothing. I called ARS to see what what going on. I was put on hold and then hung up on. I called back and a gentleman answered and then again put me on hold. Few minutes later he came back on the line to tell me that the technician scheduled had a “family emergency”. I respect that, but where’s the customer service to inform me of the situation? I specifically came back early from vacation for this appointment and this is how I get treated. No “keeping me in the loop”, “no call”....NOTHING!

Called whirlpool to inform them of the situation and they apologized that they contracted with ARS and would set me up with another company.

Please people, do not use this company....they don’t care about the customer!!!<//text>< user>

The service rep is very Disrespectful and is lacking the skills to work with female customers.  The tech refused to provide his name after being asked more than once.  The tech was very condensending and rude, in addition to thinking it was very funny how Disrespectful he was, he even laughed on his way out on how he spoke to me.< /Text>

<review>It is amazing to me that this company is still in business. Technicians are poorly trained with horrible attitudes. Office staff are completely unprofessional. They install with used parts and somehow each time I've dealt with them the appliance ends up with more problems than it started with. They contract their repair services with other stores but it is up to us as consumers to demand better. Warranty service should be reliable while this company's work is so shoddy you void the manufacturers warranty. Do not let this company near your appliance. Learned my lesson after they destroyed 3 items.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80ea4383b3b5f9a1:0x134212350afdd0ac</Gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

I am so sick of this company. My brand new fridge from lowes broke 2 months ago and they "fixed it" while the man lectured me for 20 minutes on the way to properly close my fridge like I was incompetent. I informed him I know how to close my fridge. It took multiple appointments just for that service, an assessment, came back and told me my fridge needed to be unplugged for 72 hours (told lowes they only told me 24) and finally back to repair. The repair lasted not even 3 weeks and the fridge and freezer stopped cooling appropriately. I called lowes and once again they sent this company. My fourth 8 am Saturday appt showed up just to say I needed replacement parts. They set an appt for a week, never showed. I called them and they said they didn't have the parts and set a new appt, never showed. A month of no communication and another hour call into lowes to finally get management on my case since I haven't had a working fridge/freezer in a month! Lowes called this company and they said the parts weren't in. The management had me in cue for a call at lowes and I got a call this morning from lowes and Carmen on the line saying they could do the job tomorrow and had the parts. Literally the second we hung up I got a call from Carmen that they in fact did not have the parts and she made a "mistake". All of my efforts to get a manager on my case were ruined because she misinformed lowes. I told Her she needed to call them and inform she made a mistake and she said she cannot call on a customers behalf. So now - my fridge and freezer have overall pretty much been broken for months with a small window of working before breaking weeks after their service, I finally was going to get manager attention and Carmen just ruined that, and Now I have to call back into lowes (tried for 30 minutes before finally Hanging up this morning) and tell them that not only can this company not fix things but I still do not have an appt or parts and get back in line for a 5 day manager call back window. On top of this I will be demanding they send a different company because if I see this phone number pop up on my caller ID one more time I am going to lose it. So unprofessional and so unorganized from months ago to now and I would not recommend them to anyone!</review>

Scheduled a repair through the KitchenAid Service WebSite.  We were assigned this company for repair. We sat around for the FOUR HOUR service window, only to have no one come and no one call.<//review>

Isidro is an awesome technician. I give him 5 stars. Unfortunately the company is awful. Their policies are rigid, their customer service is dispassionate and essentially non-existent. Again, the tech was great. There was a problem with the repair after the fact - a simple mistake of a connector not being properly placed. Getting the company to reschedule a followup was a disaster. I requested a supervisor call back THREE times and NEVER received a call. I have let Jennair know about the service. I would use Isidro in a heartbeat, but never again Appliance Repair. If you can avoid having them do your warranty repair I would!</Text>
