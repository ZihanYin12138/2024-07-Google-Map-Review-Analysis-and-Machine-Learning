Sadly the store is pretty bare of products and it was kinda dirty. There was a bunch of boxes waiting to be stocked. There appeared to be only 2 or 3 people working.< /text>

Come here to load cash onto my Green Dot card because they're significantly cheaper than any other location that offers this service. The manager always has to come out to perform the task, but they're quick & efficient & very friendly about it. Not to mention all the treat & snacks I pick up while I'm there. We definitely love our trips to Dollar Tree!</Text>

<date>1573045289368< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Would have rated this place higher however after spending about an hour or more shopping and with a full cart of $105.00 of items, I was denied use of the restroom when I needed to go and asked for the key. (They have two restrooms that used to be accessible up til recently.)  I was referred by the clerk to go use the nearest public restroom at the nearby Starbucks.  I was not only livid, but also highly embarrassed.  I clearly was spending over a hundred dollars in their dollar store but told to go to a business across the parking lot where I was spending no money and just to be able to relieve myself!  I'm sure Starbucks appreciates servicing all your restroom needs.  NOT COOL, DOLLAR STORE.  I probably won't be back.  I WAS YOUR CUSTOMER AND YOU EMBARRASS ME AND WANT ME TO GO TO ANOTHER BUSINESS WHEN I HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM BADLY ENOUGH TO ASK.  I didn't appear transient, or like I was going to abuse your facilities.    How about some courtesy for your paying customers?  Yea, I won't be back.  I'll spend my money where I'm treated better than that.  So very rude of you.< /Text>< Pics>

This store is great for a quick low price shop, there are alot of things that you can get that are pretty much the same as if you got it at a higher end store. Although there are some flops and be careful with the food, chips, candy and soft/energy drinks are good. Medicine is ok too if anything just a little less effective.<//review>

<Text>This is a great place to go if you want to save money! It is easy to get to, has lots of parking, and very friendly Associates! The inside of the store is clean and organized and if you can't find what you want, they certainly can direct you to where it's at. Unfortunately I found this place after making purchases at a higher cost at different other shops around town. I definitely would recommend it!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80853d43f64a3de5:0x715dfdd3e7080786</gmapID></record>

<review>I had bought a bunch of things from the Dollar tree for a kids event.  But we didn't end up using a few items.  So reading their policy, I went back to exchange it for something else since it was still new and not used.  They were really nice about it and allowed me to exchange it.  But once I got up to the register, I realized  I had grabbed the wrong receipt.  So there I was with a 5 year old and carrying my 2 year old with no receipt in hand to do this exchange.  Luckily for me, Claudia one of the store employees allowed me to do the exchange without a receipt.  She explained that she will allow it just this one time, which was all I needed.  It was a honest mistake on my part and she was just so amazingly nice about it.  I am truly grateful for her kindness.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I love dollar trees ... this particular one, however, was a bit messy. But It looked more like they had a big wave of people come in to grab all the Christmas stuff.. they did have some good stuff, got all the decorations -matching to- for about 4 dollars. Way better then buying a big set somewhere eles for 15-20 dollars!< /text>

Location moved from old Alamo location to this new building a few years ago.  Even though it's right down the street from a direct competitor, everytime I come into this one, their wide selection and higher quality items always astound me.<//Text>

<response>None<//response><review>Put in a balloon order for my daughter's 2nd birthday the week before.  When we got there the morning of my daughter's birthday our order wasn't there.  The woman at the register went to ask another lady about our order.  The lady shouted at us from that they had the order but they were out of helium.  I asked both women why no one called to notify us so we could have made other arrangements.  Neither offered me an answer let alone any type of apology at all.

I stated how sad that a little girl wasn't going to have balloons for her second birthday, the woman just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  Some sort of apology no matter how insincere would have been appreciated, but no one here seemed to care in the least.  Fortunate for us the other dollar store across the way had balloons on hand and the woman working there helped us so quickly and nicely so that our little girl had some sort of decoration for her party.

From now on I will stay away from the dollar tree and take my business to the other store across the street.<//review>< Gmap_id>

There is a heavy set lady with brown hair and ponytail, she works in Lane 1. Visited today 2/28/18. So glad I didnt go to her lane, she had a terrible attitude to her customers and others because her light wasnt on she was being crass to the people like that her light wasnt on they shouldnt have gone in her line. MIND YOU EVERYTIME WE GO THERE, THERE IS ONLY ONE REGISTER OPEN AND LONGGGG LINES. I was angry for the people she had attitude with. Lady GO EAT YOUR SANDWICH AND STRAIGHTEN UP OR THEY NEED TO FIRE YOU!<//text>

I am really a little choosy and meticulous when it comes on choosing a pair of shoe. Thankfully, the Generations Family Footwear owner exerted an effort on helping me choose. I was really amazed because he was very knowledgeable about every product. I am now really in love with my new footwear by the way. Quality products indeed.< /Text>

I never really expected much that’s why I am really impressed when I explore the insides of the store. They have tons of footwear collection in different styles and with the help of the staffs, I was able to get the shoes I have in mind for my baby bro. Nice local shop.<//review>< pics>

I have never heard about the store before that’s why I am quite shocked when I entered the shop. I was surprised with the different varieties of shoes and with just a minute of exploring I was able to find what I have been looking for. The owner himself even found the perfect size for me. I have been using the shoes for days and I can say that its really good quality.</Review>< user_name>

The store’s ambiance is great! Plus, the staffs and even the owner are welcoming, he even greeted us personally. I did not have any problem in looking for the shoe I have in mind. They have lots of varieties of footwear and everything looks fabulous. Although my foot size is really hard to find (my feet are really small and with that, I’ll keep my size as a secret) I’m glad that  they have the size of my dream shoes!< /review>

<Text>It was my best friend’s birthday and I really did not know what to buy for her. I was just touring around the town when I see Generations Family Footwear and then I remember that my best friend needs comfortable shoes for work. I was really glad that the store has a lot to offer but I don’t know where to start. I am really thankful for the staffs that helped me pick the one. My best friend absolutely loved it! Thanks to GFF and to your staffs!< /Text></record>

There were a lot of customers and a lot of varieties of shoes stacked up neatly all over the store. Because the store was packed, I planned to leave but then a smiling staff greeted me and assisted me. And that was odd about this shop, they were packed up with customers but they still seemed to be organized. I realized that it was because all customers have staffs assisting them. Amazing!</Text>

Some shoe stores I have been does not accept return just because I didn’t have the paper wrapping, and the store cannot sell them to anyone without the paper.

<Review>The owner of this store is a friendly, caring creature. He took time to measure my feet, and see if a shoe would fit. He was honest and told me that the shoe I loved was not going to work for me because my smaller foot (feet are almost never the same size) was not aligning properly with the sole. I really appreciated his time and honesty. Thank you, kind sir!</Review>< Name>

My father wants to have a new pair of shoes for his birthday. So, I decided to give him his wish. I brought him to Generations Family Footwear and he had a great time looking at the selections. We spent an hour searching for the right pair of shoes since there are a lot of good ones to choose from.</review>

Every area of this store is neat and well-arranged. When I got here last week, I had no issue of finding the specific shoe design that I'm looking for. Kudos to the staffs for their organizations skills!<//Text>

I visited Generations Family Footwear first on their website and upon looking to their products; I had fallen in love with the Ecco Felicia Sandal. Since I was just around the area, I visited the store itself to see if it’s really high-quality before buying it and I was not disappointed. It was really comfortable and stylish. This is my favorite shoe now!</text>

Generations Family Footwear has become my go-to store already. Ever since my brother bought his pair of shoes from there, I was encouraged to visit it. I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. I wear it most of the time because it is really comfortable for the feet.< /Review>

<review>I’ve been a constant customer in GFF and they neverdisappointed me with their product and services. The latest stocks today are awesome. I’m planning to buy another comfy slipper again. Hope that the owner would accommodate and share some shoe tips for me again. Thanks again sir!<//review>< pictures>

Nice collection of shoes. The store is clean too and I did not have any problem on looking for the pair of shoes that I want since the owner himself guided me through their products.</Review>

This is my favorite shoe store.  Only store that carries my size 13 Ecco boots.

Also love my olukai sandals that I have every color choice in my closet.

<name>Robert Ruchinskas<//name><Review>This is a true muni course for better or for worse.  I enjoyed the routing, the elevation changes, and the quality of the greens which could be maddening at times due to the pitch and slope. I see how this course can get criticized as some of the fairways in the valleys were wet, there was crabgrass and uneven lies in the rough areas, and some of the tee boxes, particularly the par 3's, were in bad shape.  I can also see how the pace of play can be glacial as the first 5-6 holes are so tight that they will challenge anyone with a double digit or worse handicap.  The day I played the blues were all the way at the back for most every hole meaning the par 3's on the front played 231 and 180 and the course played very tough.  Pace of play was excellent, despite a booked tee sheet, as we went out early in the morning and even started 10 minutes before the tee time to finish in under 4 hours.  Overall I'd be happy to play this as a resident and didn't feel ripped off at all for the 18 holes walking plus a small bucket for $50 charged to a non-resident.  It's a smart course that makes you think and use most every club, has some great elevation changes, and some good views of the city.  And unlike other posts the staff checking me in were wonderful.  What more can you expect from a city muni? Not much, in my opinion.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Love this course!! Very challenging golf course. Played here 05MAR21. course was in great shape and the greens role true and fast. First four holes hit you right in the mouth with tight Fairways and you really can't go right or left. After that it opens up, but you may already be frustrated from what you just went through! This will test your skills for sure. Club house is old and could be updated, but the staff is very friendly. This time of year this has to be one of the best courses in San Diego.</text>

If you haven't tried footgolf you're missing out. Other than possibly being shanked in the head by a golf ball it is less stress and still brings out good competition. Fun course with a lot of up and downs.<//Review>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Terrible time. Played for 5hrs on the 18 hole course and only got to tee #14. Finally just had to leave. The pace was incredibly slow, golfers taking dozens of practice shots. Had to wait 20-30 minutes to tee off on some holes. No marshals. Our group was very disappointed and unfortunately will never be returning to the 18 hole course.<//text><Name>Monica Cistrone</Name><gmapID>0x80d95482b06ef9e1:0x27eb351da63a5a4b< /gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I was at the golf course having breakfast at Tobey's. Great views from the deck match the food that was served. A new San Diego favorite.<//Review>

If you are coming from out of town, avoid this course. It's a mess. Looks nice from a distance but the tee boxes and greens are mostly dirt and dead grass. Worse though, the they can't manage tee times. We showed up to play, paid and when they called our tee time, there were six players on the tee. Two clearly did not have a tee time, but the staff could not sort it out. So we got refunds and left. It is very poorly run.<//text>

< Review>
I was made to feel uncomfortable every time I come to this golf course because of amount of homeless and underage kids drinking throughout the canyon and parking lot. Also it seems like every time I come here the employees like to complain a lot! The only good thing about this course is the difficulty, It is a challenge that’s about it.<//Review>

<Text>San Diego resident card definitely helps in costs. But staff is all friendly, awesome restaurant on site with good food.

As for golf... Fun course! Definitely challenging but worth playing. I play this course about 20x a year. It's always a challenge. If you're visiting SD or havent played it. Check it out!<//Text>< Rating>

Needs new facilities(currently repairing many of the uneven tee boxes which is very good) and probably a couple different staff members but this is a good course for the money. There are 27 holes in total (full 18 and par 3 9). Greens can be very fast if it's dry conditions.<//Review>< Name>

Went with my kids to hit some balls or whatever that is called. Bought a bucket of 100 balls, the guys in the shop were so friendly to let us borrow some clubs. Had lots of fun. Also great fish tacos in the cafe. Super friendly waitresses there. Great view from outdoor patio. Great place with neighborhood feeling.</Review>

Great deal for San Diego residents, however, staff is incredibly rude and not accommodating. They didn’t have nearly enough golf carts to go around so we were forced to walk the hilly 18 holes. Staff scoffed at our questions about cart availability as if wanting to rent a golf cart to play 18 holes in the summer heat was a ridiculous request! Will not be bringing my business to Balboa anymore< /Text>

This is for the 9-hole course. Fairly basic executive length course. Nothing noteworthy good or bad about it. Not the best deal for non-residents. Staff was very friendly.</review>

<text>As traveler to San Diego, I have to maximize my golf time by ranking the courses I play. On my personal ranking of San Diego golf courses, Balboa Golf Course is in the middle tier. There are a bunch of courses that I've ranked MUCH higher. That being said, on my next trip to San Diego, I will be skipping Balboa Golf Course.</text>< Pics>

Friendly staff and a very good and often overlooked Billy Bell gem make for a nice afternoon in San Diego. Walking is tough but can be done. The nine holes is fun too Twenty seven holes of fun and tough golf. Very affordable.</review>

<text>Came from out of town. Signed up for the 9 hole just to pass time. Showed up, front desk associate was very rude, prices on website not the same if you are not local. Tried to sign up for the driving range only to be given attitude saying they were closing in a little while. If your coming from out of town, go somewhere else...why give us a late tee time to just give us attitude.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Play the 18 course! It's challenging and scenic. They ran out of carts which caused a wait and backup but management chipped in to make it worth the inconvenience.< /text>

<review>We are beginning golfer's and do the 9 hole course at Balboa almost weekly. It is a fun course to learn on. You get to use your driver's and irons from the different Tee's so you can really practice all of your clubs. The 19th hole restaurant serves up some pretty good food.</review>< pics>

My worst experience with a golf course. For such an unimpressive course its a shame they charge double the price of Torrey Pines. They wouldn't let my 4-some golf together, nor would they let me golf without a complete set of clubs (instead charging me 55$ for another incomplete set), nor would they let me bring outside beverages on the course. Ended up paying 110$ to deal with stuck  up management, and an unimpressive course.

Go to Torrey pines, its 20$ cheaper for residents... somehow.<//Review>

<Review>Meh. It’s pretty. Course is pretty chewed up. CROWDED. We were visiting from out of town and had 4.5 hours in between events and were hoping to get through 16-17 holes. We got in 7. Yes, 7 holes in 4.5 hours...on a Thursday.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

Great course layout. Facility is older and in dire need of upgrades. Location near downtown is outstanding, especially in the afternoon as the sun sets. Reasonable green fees for residents, but pricey for non residents. Will likely return, but sparingly.<//Text>

<Review>The course was in immaculate condition and greens rolled perfectly. Played in just around 4 hours with only an occasional wait to hit a shot.
Pro shop very friendly and helped us to move up our tee time. Always a great experience at Balboa.

<Text>Balboa Park is a San Diego treasure, for the tourist as well as the local crowd. The driving range at Balboa is a lovely and affordable way to practice one's golf swing, catch a few rays, grab a soda at the on site grille and shop for new golfing duds. I spent 6 dollars on a small bucket of balls, borrowed a Callaway 7 iron and a 3 wood from the pro shop and began my warm up stretches. My neck and back have been very tight the past few weeks and it showed in my hit. No multidirectional slicing, just straight hitting, but the tightness felt in my bilateral shoulder and my right hip for follow through made those first 20 balls burners with distance of only 75 to 100 yards. But thankfully I know some useful stretches that made those last 10 balls fly higher and further. Golf is truly a mental game requiring the ability to relax the body while contorting the spine while simultaneously keeping your eye on the ball way past the point of impact. For a municipal facility, this place offers the beginner as well as the advanced the opportunity to act like Tiger or Phil for the afternoon. Golfing etiquette is highly encouraged with its proximity to Little Italy and the upscale area of Mission Hills. San Diego boasts several great municipal courses and ranges but Balboa with its plethora of amenities is an area fav for sure.</Text><pics>None< /pics><date>1560131924511</date><rate>5<//rate><user_name>Annie Roller</user_name><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

<Text>1 star simply because as of late, every round I've played has taken over 5 hours to complete.  They have a marshall that operates on the course in the early morning hours, but needs to be out on the course in the afternoons as well.  Course is fun to play, but I'll no longer visit if this trend continues over my next couple of rounds, which is a shame because as a resident it'd be nice to keep this in my rotation.  I don't care how nice a course is, it's NEVER fun if it takes you over 4-4.5 hours to play.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The Admission: FREE to come to Balboa Park. There are 15 museums (with admission fee), 10 gardens (free except Japanese garden) and the famous San Diego Zoo.

This place is huge!! You can spend all day here~ First, I would suggest you visit the Visitor Center and grab a map. Ask the staffs any suggestions or recommendations of what to see and where to go depends on your interest.

If you are coming to San Diego, Balboa Park is a MUST TO SEE place! Not only the tourists love coming here... but also the locals too. I saw many people jogging in the park.<//text>

Every time I've played here, it's been in fair to good shape. The greens are soft, but have a good roll, not blazing fast. There are some right fairways, dog legs, canyons and hills. It's pretty fun and not overly challenging (you're not going to hit any houses). It's walkable, but it's not easy.<//text>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Great municipal course with many memorable holes.  Biggest negative for me is cart paths are everywhere and sometimes too close to canyons, fairways and greens making for bad breaks. Great views, small greens, elevation changes, hawks overhead, jets landing, often windy. If you drive ball and putt well you can score but if you are off your game it can be a long day. Relatively challenging walk. Not a beginner's course.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Ridiculous wait times. Was told when we paid for our tee time at noon that if we could only get 9holes in that they would “take care of us” which didn’t happen and they refused to refund our 18 hole fair when we could only get 9 in in almost 4 hours. Bad customer service and course management. As a Palmer advantage member and avid golfer, I would not recommend golfing here.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

This is a fun coarse with a good mix. Some wide fairways, narrow fairways, long holes, and elevation change. If your walking save some gas for heartattack hill. Currently $32 with your resident card.<//Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Text>Played here Aug 2015. The course was in very good shape overall, the greens were in very good shape too. Greens were a little bumpy, but soft for landing lobs and fast while putting, even though the nap of the grass was long. Hole #4 layout is pretty bogus! (I was looking for the windmill but never found it...) Hole #16 is verrrrry narrow. I played twilight and walked, so it was cheap. However, it is heavily played, and although twilight started at 3:00PM, I didn't get out till after 4 and ran outta daylight. Still got 15 holes of fun play in and would definitely go again.<//Text><Rating>4<//Rating><time>1439005752389</time><username>MDP< /username></record>

This is a great Muni course.  As of July, 2014, they have the course in great shape.  I think of Balboa as a hidden gem.  It has enough canyon and ridge terrain to make it quite challenging.  They almost always keep the greens in good condition< /Text>

If you like flat boring layout that look the same hole after hole then this course is not for you. This course has many tight fairways with small greens, elevation changes, dog legs, straight away, you name it. Almost every hole is different and you really need to bring your A game. Front nine is brutal. Back nine is easier. Twlight rate at 2pm is good value. Would play again if I get a chance...</Review>

Such a fun track! Not 100% pristine conditions, but a wonderful course and a steal for their pricing</text>

I wouldn't recommend this course. There are a couple of good holes, the best being the par 5, 16th. I walked but be warned there are a few hills. The general condition was poor but they had floods a couple of weeks before. The greens were ok. Be warned, play is very slow. Three hours for the first 9 holes, five and a half to complete the round.<//text>

I don't care what anyone says, 3-6 are three of the most potentially demoralizing holes in san diego. I love this course! Play a draw and a fade to break 80. A blessing when carts are restricted. Compression at the first par 3 occasionally sucks but thanks to a subsequent par 5, opens right up. Good work Balboa.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Interesting and challenging golf course (goes up and down). Care condition could be better, there are definitely nicer places but we have not regretted the round.

Vic runs a great little barber shop. Great haircuts at reasonable prices. Quick and friendly service. Always makes time for his regulars and accommodates walk ins. Definitely the best barber shop in upland.< /Review>

You can be nice, welcoming, and offer little extras like a nice hot towel with your cut. But you at least have to know how to cut! And I’m NOT picky at all. That barber totally jacked up my hair and now I have to wait for it to grow back!</review>< Pictures>

I've been going here for a couple years now, however he(vic) always has new barbers coming in and out. I feel as if they're new students or something because they can never cut my hair right. Constantly getting nicked by the trimmers, my hair is never even on both sides. One side looks like a fade, the other a taper. I used to get my beard lined up from them. However the time before last I went in and the lady made my chin line up so crooked.

If you wanna get a haircut from here, only get it from vic. Dont get one from the other two girls he has working there. They do not know what they're doing. If I could rate just vic,  5 STARS. But I've legit received better haircuts at the 6 dollar hair salons then I do at this 19 dollar barber.<//text>

It wasn't busy. It wasn't a bad environment. It was quick. I was in and out of there which is what some people are looking for when needing something for their car. The staff was polite and available. I would come here again and I will.</review>

<Text>Nicely remodeled store, they have everything and run shuttles so I’ve been able to order parts in the morning and have them sometimes the same day. Working on my GFs truck and has been a blessing having a great parts store to rely on! And locally owned!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Bought an auto part in NAPA Redlands and thought I could return it to this store NAPA Big Bear and they refused to take it even though NAPA's return policy says I could.
Way to screw over your local citizens NAPA!
I guess I am buying parts on Amazon from here on out. Good luck NAPA.

Clean store, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Well stocked with the common items most likely needed for typical vehicle maintenance in Big Bear. Plus, they sponsor engine raffled off at the annual Big Bear Lake Antique Car club raffle!</Text>

I have been a loyal patron for nearly 20 years but I will NEVER take my business here again! I have a battery under warranty that is leaking acid out of the posts so bad that it eroded the entire terminal and ate through the main power relay wire. I tried returning the battery but the manager claims that the liquified corrosion is standard and not a problem. It is bubbling around the terminals and posts but she will charge the battery and I can pick it up in a few hours... Lmao

Horrible service!!!  I walk in there are 4 guys standing around ,no customers. I Just needed a battery for my car remote.  Instead of looking up in the computer to assist me on the battery typ. A guy in his 40's about 6' just pointed to the end of the Isle and said I could look there.  When I asked if they had a small screwdriver to open my remote ,he litterly tossed a small flathead screwdriver on the counter ( which obviously was going to be too big)  I was astonished at how rude he was by his actions an disinterest in helping!! I'm a Law Enforcement Officer ! And a female which was the only reason why I was able to keep my cool!# I'm used to dealing with these kind of miserable people! #  Just quit your job allready!    Just learn how to treat others the way you want to be treated or at least the females in your family!!<//text>

There's nothing better than getting to visit a beautiful waterfall in the midst the grandeur of Kings Canyon and being able to easily accommodate friends and family who need wheelchair access. This location, tucked in between two magnificent cliff faces, is best viewed in the spring when the river is swollen with snow melt. With a parking lot and a paved path not more than 300 ft from the highway, this is an ideal location.  Learn more about the Kings Canyon Region by visiting our Google Maps Pin.</Text>

<Date>1603533268020</Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>Hidden gem that is a must! After exploring Kings Canyon i was beat but I made roaring river my last destination before heading back to the Airbnb. The trail to the river is very short although the river is at the end of the park. Be prepared to climb some rocks but you’ll be rewarded by the waterfall and river that lays at the end of the trail. Although many enjoyed the river from afar, i dived in! The fresh water was so crisp. It was definitely the best way to end the day.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXXCY5CxrBvJaguWRlISpWFSGSp8Eqqbkaea4I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcngemHledrYg7a2PYuOvu7XS9EgmsMAR13Imf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Visiting sequoia trees is good. But the Kings Canyon is must. I was hesitant to go as it was afternoon when I left the sequoia trails but luckily, I made the call to go. Add few hours to your schedule (2-3?) as the drive is just spectacular. You won’t regret it. And charge your phone as you will take a lot of snaps :D< /text>

<text>Fantastic spot to stop and have a bite to eat or just a quick snack while visiting Kings Canyon National Park. I’m a huge fan of water falls and this spot was just terrific.

Tucked away away the end of the road in from Fresno, this pretty hike quickly brings you to a beautiful, full-fledged waterfall surrounded by bright grey summer stone and reflective clear water briskly rushing along a rock-strewn stream.</Review>

<review>Quick and easy spot to check out. Even there were a lot of visitors over the memorial weekend in 2021, people were in and out at this spot so we were able to find parking g spot without any problem. Took less than 30 min to hike, took picture and enjoy, and go back to the car. Recommend.<//review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) Beauty of waterfalls. Two hours driving and worth every minute. There are other attractions nearby. In short, heaven.

< review>
The employee who helped me did not understand when I was asking for a 2010 Prius engine air filter.  Yet he brought me an oil filter so when I said nevermind that part and ring me up for the rest because I will be going elsewhere where an employee will understand what I am asking for, that employee straight told me to have a good day and put the rest of my purchase away.... Then when I called the store manager and Andres answered, I had explained the situation how I have given this store several attempts and they have not been a good experience he then to say sorry before he hung up the phone.   What horrible service all the way around.  What a way to lose business.<//review>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>We frequently order from the Rolling Hills location and have been very satisfied with the quality of food and service. However, on Saturday, evening, January 30, the on-phone order taker failed to input our complete order and.  In addition, the salad we ordered was swimming in dressing, even though we asked that the dressing be on the side.  So our order was incomplete for which we paid, and the instructions we gave were not followed.  Pleae check youir order before leaving the restaurant with your takeout.<//Text><date>1612066841352<//date><Name>Bob Armstrong< /Name><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Been coming here for 5 years, and they've really kept their standards up. No wonder they are almost always busy. Seriously, order on the phone so it's ready when you get there! To be honest, the chicken can be pretty dry if you don't order a whole chicken or thigh. All of their dishes are really fantastic though; the Chinese chicken salad being my favorite. Friendly staff, excellent food, a great combination!<//review>

I can't count the number of times that I've been here, so I won't try. Enough times that I've settled into having 'the usual' whenever I stop by.
Spicy gyro plate. Very much the best.< /Review>

< Review>
I rated this place five stars before, because the food and service were both great. However what happened yesterday ruined my lunch and my experience. I paid the cashier and told her the amount I gave her at same time; the cashier took my money, said nothing, put it away then gave me less change than she should. When I asked why, she then said I gave her less than I told her! I asked why you didn't say so before you put the money away? She started to argue with me to insist that I was wrong.  When I asked to speak with manager, she said she is acting as manager. After about 8 minutes, she said how about a free drink, I said no, I just want correct change. I my view, cashier should put customer's payment on the counter, gave change to customer first then put money away, so in case of dispute, the original money is still there for counting.  I would not be upset if she admitted her mistake and give me the correct change right way, but she didn't. We also noticed there was no air conditioning, the room was very hot and uncomfortable yesterday, and the "lemon-mint water" tank was just filled with tab water. It seems that current manager is trying to cut cost and get more money from customers in any way she can. As a long time customer, I am very disappointed.<//Review>

Mediterranean style cooking where one can mix and match side dishes. Always flavorful and dine in or take out. Efficient and helpful staff with a smooth operation. Call ahead for orders and ready upon arrival.</Text>

Placed perfectly in the peninsula shopping center.  This place is always packed and many people order carry out.   The place is very busy so I suggest carryout.

The whole chicken meal for 20 bucks is great.  Get the rice as a side.  I liked the grape leaves too!  I did get the lemon garlic basil seasoning.  It was great.  The portions are huge.   We get about 4 meals out of it if we eat sparingly and have dessert.</Review>

Delicious food at a good price. Fresh, hot, and healthy--I'd go here often if I lived in the area.

Secret menu item: you can ask for fries instead of the two sides, and you get a huge portion along with the killer garlic sauce. But you have to ask for them.</text>

I stumbled on Cicken Maison on Yelp. It had over 500 5 star reviews.  What a gem. The first thing you see is the impressive chicken rotisseries and the squeaky clean kitchen. I had spicy garlic chicken kabob on rice which was moist and the spicy garlic sauce was delicious not really spicy, it came with a really fresh Greek style salad, that dressing was freshly prepared and a generous helping of fresh steamed vegetables. My colleagues had the rotisseries chicken which I had a bite and it was so moist and flavorful yum. The whole experience was very enjoyable. Only weird part was it was our first time and we didn't know that there was a choice between fountain drinks or canned soda which must of been fir take out. But we got tha canned as we didn't know there was fountain drinks.</Text>

The food provided at Chicken Maison is wonderful, and not "fast food".   Many delicious offerings; the staff is great.   I see that a few folks were concerned about order mistakes, so I guess they're human, but can't imagine why anyone would "never go their again".  They're missing out on the best food value on the hill.</Review>

I was not expecting this so very delicious chicken meal for about $10 and in about 10 minutes.  The plan was to take it to work, but after one bite I ate the whole thing in the car! The cashiers who are both going off to college soon were very pleasant and gave great recommendations.</Review>

Has the ownership changed? The last 2 times I have been here the food wasn't as good as before. The chicken kabob was precooked so it was not very hot and dry. Also, staff wasn't friendly and I was ignored at the table when I needed something. One more thing, the rice was wet.</Review>

I usually order take out,  but all my orders have been on the mark. Chicken is the main attraction,  but Mediterranean items are also popular. Orders are completed quickly, and service is great.< /Text>

The worst manager ever!  They got my order wrong 5 times at lunch today.  I ordered 1/4 chicken, dark meat, spicy sauce and as the two sides I wanted the Med fries.  What came out was 1/4 chicken, white meat, regular, regular fries.  I sent it back and it came back just as it was.  I sent it back again and it came back with the spicy sauce on top of chicken with additional bill for $1.  I sent it back and it came back for the med fries and they argued that it was.  I reminded them that the med fries has garlic sauce on it.  She said "oh yeah".  Came out again and when I cut into the chicken it was the breast.  Then the manager argued with me that it WAS dark meat.  I would think that by the 5th time they would have comped my order.

I called the owner and he hasn't returned my call.  The manager is the owner's son.  Figures!

I will never go there again, and I used to go all the time.  And I'll tell everyone about my experience too.

Train your employees for customer service!<//Text>

Terrible delivery service! I was yelled at by the delivery person because they didn't know how to open an unlocked gate door! It took maybe a minute to get inside. And when I apologized, I was met with a dirty look and a snarky comment. Embarrassed me in front of neighbors. Never again will I order from a place with such rude deliver persons!<//Review>

I've been here several times over the years, unfortunately too infrequently. I usually would get the chicken Caesar salad, and each time I would see someone else get the pesto fettucine and think to myself, 'I really need to get that next time.' While I love the salad, this time was 'next time.' The fettucine dish was fantastic. I also sampled a variety of dishes that my family had at this meal, and I have not tasted anything here that I have not liked.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Chicken Maison is average - at best.  Essentially it's best of the worst as far as quick pickup food and twice as expensive.  What annoyed me most about my experience was that the 18 year old kid that brought my food out assured me that everything was in the bag (couldn't double check it because it was tightly tied by the handles of the bag)-which when I got home 15 mins later and ripped open the bag found that it wasn't the case.  So when I called them back to tell them what was missing - the resolution provided by the High School aged counter girl was to give me what was missing next time I was there.  So essentially I would be overpaying for food I wouldn't pick up for a month or more.  If this is customer service, they don't get any stars - only reason I give them 1 star is because the food is probably better then McDonalds, KFC, and El Pollo Loco - but this isn't saying much and I could have saved some money.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Amazing service. Great prices.

<Review>My mom has gotten 3 cars from this place. All of them have turned out great! I purchased my own car a year ago, my dream car, and I am very satisfied with it. I would definitely recommend this place to everybody.< /Review>< Pictures>

The cars look nice on the outside however they only do an oil change before selling and don't check the engine even though most of the cars are over 200x miles. They are also overpriced . If I wanted to spend 3000 dollars on a down payment I would go to a new car lot to do so and have a new car.<//text>

Absolutely loved my experience!!  I love my car... I bought a 2004 Isuzu Ascender and it's been great to me.... The guys here really made me feel comfortable and confident that I had made a great choice... Although they don't a lot of vehicles at their Riverdale location to choose from they do have a little of everything like small 2door Hondas, 4door sedans,  trucks & SUVs<//Text>

La verdad antes ya eh comprado vehiculos ahi pero ahora estan bien por fuera por dentro ya estan bien trabajados y con algo de millas por ejemplo un kia forte 2010 con 132,000 millas el precio es de casi 8,000 dls y de down quieten 3000 dls. El pago de 300 la verdad es mejor ir a una agencia mejor establecida que te dan garantia y el precio muy pero muy debajo de 5000 dls 😡< /Review>

Staff was non existant. I had to go buy pillows. Tvs are old, hot water lasted a couple of minutes and was not safe. People staying in cars half the night in parking lot and trying to ooen the door at 4am. Stay away frim this place and should be removed from hotels.com listing. I had three nights booked and left to a new hotel after one night. Lost the money but was worth it as could not stay there again.<//Review></record>

<rating>1<//rating><text>The room smelled of urine. I had to disinfect the room before putting anything of mine down. Roaches were everywhere; In the shower, on the towels, on the floors, crawling all over the bed and walls. The other patrons were loud, yelling and playing music in the parking lot. Trash was everywhere. There were dogs, babies and tweakers up all night. I only stayed for 4 hours, was booked for two days. They will not give you a refund 😡😡
Thats what I get for letting my husband reserve a room lol. Ended up staying at Best Western.<//text>< user_id>

Stayed a night at this hotel because we just needed a place to stay the night that was cheap. The prices were pretty cheap so we booked it for a night. Getting there outside it looked decent, a few parked cars and weird looking persons that made us think the rooms might be ghetto. Got down to check in and the service was quick and fast. Went to my room and was surprised on how the room looked inside. Decent size room, everything looked updated and decent bathroom. Next time im in town I will stay here again. Good prices and a comfortable stay.</Review>

< Review>
I did not end up staying. Checked out 10 mins after getting there due to the room not being what was pictured on the website. Room smelled like cigarette smoke, a lot of random people on property, saw a couple in the parking lot doing drugs like it was the thing to do. Looking out the window I had was what looked like a dump yard. I was not happy with this hotel at all. Tried to check out and they still charged me for two nights after giving them my complaints and informing them I did not feel safe. But the guys said it wasn’t fair to them that they lose the money. Well it’s not fair they catfished the hotel and really do not care for their hotel guest safety. If I could give negative stars I would. I do not recommend this place at all.<//Review>

Staff is very professional, friendly, and kind. Vacationed in the area a year ago and was happy to see the same staff again. Please don't confuse this particular hotel with other OYO brands in the area because this one is the BEST.< /Text>

< Review>
The most unpleasant hotel room I've ever stayed in.

There is mold in the shower, the room smells of cigarette smoke (likely from heavy smokers in an adjacent room), the sink leaks, the chair is  heavily stained, the doors are dirty from a thousand hands, the floor is dirty, the bed is slightly caved in, the pillow is lumpy, the AC unit only reads in celcius, the shower water temperature goes up and down, the bathroom vent fan shrieks, there are a few flies in the room, the wash towel is concerningly dark, and the hotel's sign isn't lit at night.

But at least the linens are clean and the assistant is friendly.<//Review>

We were there for a total of one day and one night. That was it. We needed a place to crash while we had business in Ridgecrest and it was a convenient place. I will say that. It was convenient. We had what we needed and we had access to restaurants a minute away just by walking.<//review>< rating>

<review>Nice little place to rest up. Room was clean. Furniture is updated. Flat TV ( no cable )
Parking in front of room was convenient.

Con:
No deadbolt on door. Just a simple push to lock on door knob.

Noise seems to find it's way in rather easy.

Pro:

Inexpensive
Clean
Convenient</review><username>Alex Gurrola<//username>< Gmap_id>

There were cockroaches all over and mice. Also customer service was very disrespectful and rude. They told us we had to pay ten dollars extra each hour we stayed there so we agreed to that, then she was knocking on our door each hour asking for money . We already agreed on paying more to stay but she wanted us to check out instead of paying so we did then they kept our deposit and told us that we don't have nothing coming in a very rude way. We did nothing wrong and they made a problem with us. There are many more places to stay in the town of Ridgecrest this place was very disappointing< /review>

Please Don't stay here. Working out in the area and booked a room with kitchen. The room was not clean a/c did not work and was missing contol knobs.Restroom was very questionable and had mold in the shower. Outside the hotel is very active with undesirable activities going one. If I was to see the hotel in person before I booked it would have been a no go. Left because the didn't have another room with a refrigerator and was denied refund. Given a customer service number and got hung up on 3 times before I was able to fully explain the situation. Then I was told my matter was going to be transfered to their finance department. Please don't stay here I stayed at other hotels similar priced that actually take pride in their business this is not on. Stayed at America inn down the street and got same priced room night and day difference. Oyo is a no go for me from now on. Don't waste your money or time with this hotel.</review>

Comfortable Motel To Stay At A Good Price. Ridgecrest Is The Perfect Place To Rest Between Death Valley National Park And The Secuoyasnes A Simple Motel But With In-Room Amenities Such As Microwave, Not All Tienennhay A Large Supermarket Nearby, Ideal To Buy Your Dinner Or Picnic For The Day Siguientensu Price Was Most Affordable .. The Place Is Located Is Something Desangelado<//text>

< Review>
I asked to extend my stay by one more night and was refused, even though many of the rooms are empty. I was then yelled at for taking a chair outside even though I asked when I checked in if smoking was allowed outside the room. I have a feeling I won't be getting my security deposit back fo some made up bull, even though te room was disgusting. Dont stay here. Cannot emphasize that enough.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Just left the OYO hotel after my one night there in January 2020. They charge a 50 dollar deposit and do a walkthrough check when you checkout before they give it back. The younger man doing this searched through until he found the dirtiest rag and charged 10 dollars out of the deposit for it. When I asked him about the amount I was cursed at me and told to leave. Otherwise clean hotel, but take into account it’s cheap for a reason.< /text>< pics>

<Text>STAY AWAY.  I booked a stay from Friday through Sunday (8/21 to 8/23) and went out to eat Sat. When returned to hotel my key was deactivated and all of my belongings were gone. The front spoke almost no English, wouldn't refund me and didn't know where belongings were taken to. I have filed complaints with their complaint number, emailed and did online chat through their chat line and they are still refusing my refund or credit me for my stolen belongings. If you want to get robbed, book here.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

We had to check in after-hours (after 10:30 pm) and the woman in the office was very nice and helpful! I picked a room on the first floor and it was convenient that I could literally park my car right in front of my door, which made unloading my bags much easier. We couldn’t figure out how to turn on the hot water, but the WiFi here is excellent. We only stayed here for the night while heading to Death Valley and I would say this place is great for a short stay such as this!</text>

Comparable to Motel 6. Clean, comfortable rooms, maid service, TV, refrigerator, microwave, etc. Only one major difference, TV reception is not quite as good, even though it appears to be cable. Overall, a nice place to stay, with friendly, helpful staff.</review>

The single rooms are a bit small. I was employed there 30 years ago and can honestly say that the modifications have been minimal since then.
The motel really shows it's age and the lack of staffing leaves alot to be desired.
My last stay was for 3 days. And  I never seen anyone from housekeeping to make up bed, or freshen the towels. And took out my own trash up to check out. The manager was very rude......asking for accomadations like toilet paper and towels, was of great inconvience. while she would send her son, boyfriend or whoever he was to do the job. I must say at least he was polite and put a smile on his face. The mangers public presentation was very sloppy and  unkept. Very poor representation of the OYO Standards.<//Text>

You get pretty much get everything you need for a few nights stay. All basics like, a decent bed, microwave, old model TV. A neat washroom. Its worth the price. Just don't expect much on service. Its meant for people who stay short on the go. No breakfasts or food. So pack your own or there are plenty of the regular branded fast food options.</text>

Almost no plug worked and the heater was so loud it was almost impossible to sleep. The check in was easy but the check out a rip off. They take a deposit and won’t give it back to you in full by arguing that a towel was dirty.... I would definitely not recommend this motel unless you have spare money to spend.</review>

We had just left a very difficult situation and moved back to Ridgecrest. After watching all kinds of foolishness at another neighboring motel and being run around about the rooms and prices we spoke with Sylvia (mama) at travel Inn and Suites, when I tell you they are AMAZING! She made sure we got a kitchenette and larger refrigerator as we had children also! We stayed a total of 3 weeks and with 5 children that's says a lot! She is very understanding and is doing great things for those in less than perfect situations! The rooms are nice, and they are remodeling and the upper rooms are stunning with glass bowl wash basins!!!!! The hotel itself is quiet, and conveniently located near fast food and walmart. The service we received was impeccible and I would definitely go back to see her for even just a day/night get away! If your looking for great people who take pride in their work and are understanding this is your place! An added bonus the rates are also amazing!!<//review>

Yikes... I went here given the overall rating of 3.4. After pulling in, it was clear this was not a place I would be staying. The door to one of the rooms was open and inside were stacked tired and I think a few car batteries. These are hazardous materials that should NOT BE STORED IN A MOTEL ROOM (never mind, umm, WHY ARE THEY IN THERE??). Other rooms were open and mattresses had been moved outside of the rooms - with stains that I would rather not speculate as to their origin. One of the hotel workers (he appeared to be the manager) was standing there staring at me as I tried to decide if I needed to say something to him or just leave. I just left. I'm trying to reconcile the 3.4 rating with my experience. Was this just a bad day? There are plenty of other places to stay in this town in a similar price range. This was not for me. Nope.</Text>

< review>
December, 2017: Quiet and the beds are comfortable. Night clerk wasn't friendly and it's not very clean.

March, 2018. Over night in a room that had been "updated". Essentially, the carpet was replaced with cheap faux wood linoleum that was littered with cigarette burns. The sink was more of a water fixture than a utilitarian wash basin. The 2 cup coffee maker had a car affecting that was too short so the coffee overflowed. The bath faucet turned on and got nice and hot, but then it wouldn't turn off. Broken plastic knob.
To make matters worse, the heater had to be unplugged to turn it off. It gets better.
I had left my phone in my buddy's car and went to the front desk to use the phone to call and have my phone brought to me. The night clerk didn't answer the battery operated "bell". I tried again 30 minutes later. Still no response. Two more tries, each at 30 minute intervals got me frustrated enough to knock on the window tic, tic, tick, tic, tic with my flashlight. I watched the clock in the lobby tick off 6 minutes before he emerged from his apartment behind the office. He was genuinely angry. All I could say was, "you just took sixty of my dollars, the least you can do is answer the bell."
I then explained my phone situation and requested to use the office phone, as there are no longer land lines in any of the rooms. He told me they didn't have any phone. At which point, I was frazzled. I asked why there was a phone number listed under the sign as the number to Vagabond Inn. And if he did not let me use that phone I was going to report him for stopping me from dialing 911 and that is a form of false imprisonment.
Needless to say, he handed me the phone. This review is also being sent to their Corporate office, and hopefully, they will at least put phones back in the rooms.< /review>

I was in the room two hours before retiring. I wasn't in the bed 10 mins when a bug came out. I immediately swiped it up. Bed bug. Just to be sure I flipped the sheets and found an infestation.  Full grown adults crawling on the covers. I took the bug to the front desk immediately. I requested a new room and he would not reassign me. He accused me and my pet of bringing the bugs in to the hotel. I told him to come look at the infestation.  One person cannot bring that many bugs in at once and they are not bugs carried by pets. After an argument he angrily refunded my money. #knowyourbugs **updated- I left my purse in the closet in my hurry to leave. It was stolen. Police notified and charges pending.< /Review>

< Review>
BED BUGS. Bad service. Two pairs of shoes ruined after washing and dying everything. Very disappointed. Wondering why Google asked my to review this place again if I left a review here a month ago stating what happened?! The public needs to know if there are BED BUGS in a hotel they are considering. We have two small children...this affects the public.< /Review>

On a weekly bases I travel to Ridgecrest for business in the area, and the Best Western on China Lake Boulevard is the place I prefer to stay.

The entire staff are great. Tina is professional and friendly while checking me in, and Jim for me, is the face of this Best Western. Jim is friendly, approachable, and ready to assist at all times at 5am. He always has everything prepaired to expedite my leaving, which is greatly appreciated.

Then there is Katie, always with a smile and always willing to make coffee early before the start of the Complementary Breakfast, to be sure I leave with a hot cup of coffee. When I'm more asleep than awake her thoughtfulness is a blessing.

The Fitness Center is another reason for my staying here. This is not a "Planet Fitness" or "L.A.Fitness" with long rows of treadmills and stationary bikes. This Fitness Center is perfect for the traveler that wants to continue an exercise program away from home. There is a recumbent bike, one treadmill, and a multi- station gym. The room is air-conditioned has a TV, a wall of mirrors (makes me keep running) and just outside is the swimming pool.

There is parking on the side street with enough room for at least three semis for the truck drivers visiting, and car parking on the property is more than enough.

This Best Western has been remodeled, and all the rooms I've stayed in have been clean and comfortable.

I always recommend this place to the others at work for a comfortable night when they are in the area.

<review>(Translated by Google) Nice little motel / hotel. Staff very nice. We had accidentally booked a night late because we had the dates wrong. Everything was not a problem but of course we could stay there at no extra cost. Rooms are in a good condition. Only the mattresses would have to be replaced soon. All in all, however, very satisfied.

Schönes kleines Motel/ Hotel. Personal sehr nett. Wir hatten versehentlich eine Nacht zu spät gebucht da wir uns im Datum versehen hatten. Alles war kein problem konnten trotzdem dort übernachten natürlich ohne extra Kosten. Zimmer sind in einem gepflegten Zustand. Nur die Matratzen müssten demnächst mal getauscht werden. Alles in allem aber sehr zufrieden.</review>< username>

Hier gibt es zwar keine Rezeption, aber ich hatte Zeitnah eine Mail vom Hotel. Man sollte sich vorher anmelden, oder vor Ort die Telefonnummer anrufen, oder schauen wo das Zimmermädchen ist die dann sofort den Check in macht. Das Hotel ist frisch renoviert und hat einen neuen Namen Oyo steht vorne dran und es ist neu gestrichen grau rot. Zimmer sind frisch renoviert, das einzige was fehlt ist eine Nachttischlampe.<//Text>

We have Nijiya, Mitsuwa, and others though few are as big as this branch of Tokyo Central. You can find not only the standard fare of snacks, groceries, and Japanese food staples but there are also restaurants as well as a whole floor of home goods, tshirts and so on. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.</Review><userid>117141325247266466888< /userid>< Pictures>

It had a second floor that looks like a department store that sells dry goods like kitchen ware, clothes, appliance and Japanese trinkets. They do have Anime figurines, clothing & accessories too. There were a good variety of restaurants in the food court and the food was great.</review>< Pics>

Good produce selection, terrific sushi and seafood, and wonderful, noodles, sauces, and spices from Japan.  Best yet, many of the labels on the shelves explain and differentiate the products—very helpful when selecting a Shoyu sauce, soba noodle, or seaweed package.
Also, don’t forget to check upstairs for clothing, slippers, toys, suitcases, and other products.< /text>< GmapID>

The best Japanese supermarket in Los Angeles. It's well stocked. I found everything I needed. Sea asparagus, fresh octopus, fish meatballs, etc. They have a big parking lot. It's crazy that they are associated with Don Quixote, a cheap department type store, which I went to in Tokyo.</review>

I LOVE this store. They try their best to label everything in English to make it more accessible to folks.

If youre going to buy the plates make sure you show up before 7. At 7 pm they go on sale for 20% off but by then there's little to nothing left. People come in a little before 7 and stack their carts. Come earlier and pay full price if you really want to be able to have options.<//Text>

Lots of variety! Very fun! This particular location is huge too. Lots of fresh food compared to other locations/Japanese grocers. Felt like we were back in Japan at Don Quixote. Fairly reasonable prices.< /review>

Due to Covid-19 protocol, limited people were allowed inside the market.  But the line moves very fast.  They have some good fresh vegetables, fruits and meat section.  They have this Passion Orange Guava (POG) in 1 quart carton at the refrigerator section.  They also have one of the best deal in bento boxes meal.  A box costs between 5.99 to 6.99.  Fresh sushi, maki rolls, all at a good price.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>The best Japanese supermarket. Not only is Tokyo Central designed culturally appreciate, but also you can find various Japanese food, snacks, and cultural heritage merchandise.

Tokyo Central Market is huge, clean, and well organized. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic era, the upper stores are closed.

When you are inclined to have Japanese food, enjoy a quick look at what Japanese culture looks like, come visit Tokyo Central Market.

You won’t be disappointed.< /Review>< pics>

Love this store! I just wish there was one closer to me! Very good quality produce and meat, such a large selection of japanese liquor and snacks, and just necessities if you like japanese cuisine. I didn't get a chance to go to the second floor this trip, but apparently it's full of souvenir-type stuff. It really made me feel like I was back in Japan doing my shopping 😊</Text>

OMG! This was so much fun! It's a huge Japanese grocery store with just about everything you can imagine.  I wondered around in absolute amazement.  It's so interesting and a great cultural experience.  The staff was really helpful, even suggesting I try a neighboring store when they didn't have what I was looking for.  Be brave,  buy something you have never tried before!< /text>

I really like this place, it has a department store vibe upstairs and a grocery store down stairs. It's like a don quijote in japan stacked on a mitsuwa. I will very much be back, and might try to make it a monthly staple.< /Text>

My first time here since the changed of ownership and rebranding. I’m in the area so I decided to stop by for quick sushi and ready to eat items. This place is so huge, anything you can think of, food items and merchandise. You can definitely get lost here, overwhelming to say the least. The ready to eat items are also many different varieties.< /review>

You can get lost in the sundry area looking at all of the cool home wares, makeup, and cleaning products.

We did go looking for luau leaf to make laulau but no one has it. It was still worth going to look here. I remember when it was Marukai. Still has that vibe!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>The best prices in town for Japanese and Hawaii food items. It looks like the Don Quixote group is taking over, but I don't think that will impact the great prices. They also bring in unique food items and Japan regional fares. Right now it's strawberry season so they have cool but super expensive Japanese strawberries. The food court is also outstanding - the karaage chicken at Tenkatori is pretty awesome.
The down sides are minor stuff. I realize that they need to pack in product but I wish it was easier to maneuver the aisles. Many barely fit two carts going in opposing directions. Also the parking spaces tend to be on the tight side, and they don't have adequate very return stations.< /text><Date>1612739519692</Date></record>

I had so much fun here! My husband and I got katsu from the food court, which was amazing. I haven't had katsu this good since I was in Japan. Then I had some fun browsing the retail items upstairs, ended up buying a few gifts for my friends who like kawaii things. The household items look pretty solid too, memory foam pillows, top of the line rice cookers, etc. I was kind of surprised they didn't have a bigger variety of Asian veggies (like 99 ranch, H-Mart). But they do have those Japanese strawberries (a real delicacy).<//text>

Amazing! So many Japan products and foods!! There are two floors, first floor is mainly food and groceries. Honestly we didn't get to go to the second floor cause of how long we took looking and getting everything on the first floor. Second floor looks like it has more clothing and household appliances.<//text>

Sometimes I want to be creative and try making takoyaki or o-nigiri, I get everything I need here.

Gonna go on a long hike? They've got tons of prepped meals that can be taken togo. They have a great selection here and it's worth the visit.</Text>< user>

Crazy crowded, line literally out the door at 12:59pm on a Friday, but I've been meaning to come here for months so I was SUPER EXCITED. After not having breakfast, I was famished. I browsed some google reviews before I arrived so I knew exactly what I wanted.<//text>

You'll also find well stocked produce and high quality meat and fish. It's always festidiously fresh, clean and organized. Sushi grade fish and Kobi style beef too. Upstairs you'll find Japanese clothing, furniture, toys and antiques. Up front there's baked goods, sushi and hot food to go.< /Review>< date>

They also have a second floor with goods from Japan as well. It's definitely worth walking in and looking at all the goods they have to offer. Also, they have restaurants inside by the entrance too.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP8T3DQtThAqvk8pS7OZS0qMAcXICmu2hjLjKu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6VyQdLlA7X6ng6-rm03MYm3YghD8ZlT8tLdVD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I love Tokyo Central! There is literally nothing that I can't find. It is a two-story haven of Asian merchandise and food with excellent quality and service.If you're on the first floor you can find items like massagers, face and beauty supplies, food supplies, kitchen supplies, school supplies, and decoration materials. If you go to the second floor you can find everything from Japanese doll robes and clothes to decorations and house decor. all the items are recently priced and the staff is willing to negotiate. It's a wonderful location and I would be surprised if they didn't have what you were looking for.<//review>

I love this place, but I wish they took covid more seriously at this location. For some reason management doesn't seem to care about the health of there customers at this specific location. Baskets aren't wiped down, the number of people in the store isn't monitored and there are plenty of customers allowed to walk around maskless.

We try not to go to this location, if possible, because other Tokyo Centrals in L. A. Do a great job so we drive 30 minutes longer to be safer.

They would normally get 5 stars but Management's disregard of safety is just too big a deal for me and my family.< /review>

They really renovated this place and now it feels so Japanese you wonder 💭 if you are actually there and had memory loss about the airplane flight ✈️ and hotel. This grocery is nearly an exact replica, or slice of life, within Tokyo. I lived there for several years and the items this grocery carries along with its logistics is accurate to a T. Whoever managed this place, I could tell, is very educated and very, VERY competent. You could even come here as a “Japan travel destination” during this covid-19 madness we Los Angelinos are all going through. Just come here, this might as well be Japan.< /Review>< pictures>

Now we rarely go to the Ralph's in our neighborhood. The meat selection at TCM is 1000 times better than Ralph's for cooking Japanese food because it is sliced properly. Moreover, the fruits and vegetables are the freshest and cheapest. The Mammoth Bakery inside the TCM on RB Blvd is our favorite place to buy sliced bread, perfect for breakfast toast. We can get Crystal Geyser Water for only 79 cents a gallon! We can also get very Japanese vegetable, fruit, and herb we need there. The Artesia Blvd one has great restaurants and a bakery inside. They also have the best selection of meat and bento, IMO. I loved their karaage chicken deli, but they closed it. Their 2nd floor has character goods, cooking appliances, and clothes. My wife occasionally gets stuff up there. I love their various "fairs." We got a lot of stuff during their KAGOSHIMA Fair. It is so cool to be able to get the real taste of Japan here in So Cal.</Review>< Pics>

You better watch out Cashier's price. Sometimes It's different from the display. Two days ago, I picked a condiment(Wasabi) sign shows $1.98 but the receipt shows $2.98.
This is not first time I recall. You never know that other items.< /text>

<text>I love Tokyo Central market. Lying outside food very fast. Their deli Stand is fantastic! Just about anything I want they tend to have it when it comes to Asian cuisine. Even though it was a very long to check out it went very quick. It even had tapes stars to let you know that you were six feet away from each other. I'll definitely go again!</text>< Pics>

<text>Incredibly clean! Regarding quality and selection there's no stores in the area that can beat Tokyo Central. I'm incredibly impressed at how nice the staff is and knowledgeable!  All the employees helped me through my first visit to this extraordinary store without fail.  I felt as though I'd been transported to the Orient.
I will be back!< /text><UserId.>101652065390456738525</UserId.>< rating>

I like this Tokyo Central the best out of the locations I've been to.  They have a food court and an upstairs homegoods area.  However, this store is very popular, and that means the lines are always huge.  The lines to get in, and the check out line every time I've gone has wrapped around the store.  It also closes earlier than the other stores.</review>

Great market. This photo was new years Eve. That was a crazy day. Usually more relaxed. My wife enjoys driving all the way to this one vs the one down in Torrance.< /Review>

< Review>
This place has always been my favorite place to shop for Japanese products starting way back when it was still Marukai. When I am about to make some Shabu Shabu, I head over and buy everything I need. Now with their updated food court, it's the perfect place to shop and then pick up some Takoyaki, Karaage or a bowl of Ramen!< /Review>

Good Place for shopping. But you have to wait in line when you try to go inside sometimes it is not crowded when you try to go inside but when you try to leave the shopping you have to wait in line when you try to finish shopping. But it is a good place for Japanese Shopping.</Review>

< Review>
Had a great time picking up pre prepared snacks that aren't available 200 miles away in the Sierras where we live. We had Shoyu Ramen(should have bought Karaage chicken with it),a plate of cooked salmon, rice & "deli" selection of veggies. Also tuna, salmon & inari sushi. All was TAKE OUT ONLY! We were in our truck. There was a microwave available to use,self check, and extra soy sauce, chopsticks etc. BUSY at lunchtime then parking lot emptied out<//Review>

Great selection of just about everything you need to fill up the fridge, cook a meal, it simply snack on items direct from Japan including items you won't find at the American grocers. The fresh food market here is also underrated for sushi and chicken. Enjoy</text></record>

I like the Market, most of the store has products that contain MSG, which is a turnoff for most things, but other than that it's a nice store and I like the healthier products for sure. Lots of different options.< /Review>

<review>The BEST in LA!
Seriously Huge and Packed with just about Everything you could want from a Japanese supermarket and goods store. Makeup, detergent, furniture, stationary, gifts, home goods, electronic dictionaries, air conditioners, cookware, kitchen goods, stuffed animals, phone accessories, car scents, etc etc etc. Just Huge and the biggest, most well-stocked shop period among all of the Tokyo Central, Nijiya, Mitsuwa, and other Japanese supermarket centers in Los Angeles.
A handful of restaurants from takoyaki to karage for takeout.
Latest corona remodel gets rid of the antique furniture $$$, closed the dining (can still take out), adds a big stationary section with more pens and pencils than Kinokuniya, even more housewares, beauty supplies, tons of boxed take out meals, etc.
And prices are among the lowest at Japanese markets in L.A.
Seriously, the ONLY Japanese supermarket you need to shop at - a mini Bic Camera or Yodabashi!!< /review>< Pics>

<text>This was the former Marukai Market. Not much has changed. They still carry many Asian foods and have pre-made meals you can purchase. The layout has changed a little bit but it is now easier to shop.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvXaaMkNEP3qVDg7WRJ9ZyaySYOldDOufPBIjQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyFvDQfERxi8GZL-W07t_YvbGH67x3_YJgnnBc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrxKqnjHtbfM_uwX88J8QOOZPshjmDY9tlZdHx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>$2.87 for a bag of ORGANiC ginger; as of february 2019.

This market caters to customers that have high standards for quality produce. The mandarin fruits are consistently of high quality. Its not the cheapest market to shop for produce but there are always deals for some of the items. You can save yourself some serious dollars if you keep checking what is on sale and when.

Ping me for any additional questions. I am happy to help.

It used to Marukai. My rating of three stars offs neutral and doesn't reflect well this store. The outdoor line on a Sunday afternoon was too long so we passed through the parking lot and went to Nijiya Market instead.</Text>

Ahhhh my most favorite Tokyo Central in all the land. Rows and rows of Japanese goods, groceries, and hard to find items you'd only get in Japan. Produce was fresh as usual. The home goods store has great everyday supplies - got a (Made in Japan) donabe on sale. The food court has a great takoyaki vendor. I only wish this Tokyo Central had a hot food bar like the one in Costa Mesa!</text>

<text>Love this market ! Lots of Hawaii based items that you cannot find in other stores as well as basic Japanese staples. Freshly made sushi at reasonable prices as well as a sit down food court is always a nice option before or after your shopping.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Definitely better than Nijiya Market and Mitsuwa when it comes down to Japanese products. The store is huge and filled with so many good products with good prices. Sashimi is always fresh here and there are a lot of delicious bentos for you to choose. I love fried wontons and this store has pre-made wonton filling. I just grab the wonton wrappers and this pre-made filling, fry them at home....easy and delicious!!!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

This place featurea some hidden jewel of Asian theme items especially TAMIYA Mini 4WD Cars along with other Asian character products:toys, model kits,  dolls, etc. You need to visit 2nd Floor for all these.(It used to be on the 1st floor.)
Hope it helps to save $ compare to Amazon/eBay international sellers.</review>

<Text>Pricey for what I'm used to for an Asian grocery chain, but it might be the location (Hmart is pricier here/CA than the ones where I lived in MD/DC). Sushi/sashimi fish department has a great selection, and it's where I discovered the sashimi version of "ends and pieces: price reduced". Quite a lot of options for a fancy meat connoisseur, too.

They're worth visiting just to see all the kitsch/kawaii upstairs. I'm not much of a collector, but I've heard from others that the prices are competitive and the finds good.</Text><username>Katie Navarette<//username><UserId.>117269393218423158594< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80c2b56685ac2169:0xae5fe05abe26b2< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This used to be marukai but I guess they got bought out by Tokyo central. It's still pretty much the same though except the dining area got upgraded especially the outdoor part. This market has a big Japanese cosmetics, lifestyle, home goods area which I love! I think if I ranked the Japanese market this would be on top closely after nijiya. Mitsuwa is prettier but it doesn't have as many items. Also this market has the best chicken karaage in their food court. Always super crowded ( which is bad during this pandemic) but theres a reason why so many people go here.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

It is now my go-to place for Japanese ingredients, treats, and kitchen supplies. They also have a good selection of Gundam models upstairs along with cat models, t shirts, and other odds and ends. I've been to a few Japanese stores in the area but this is my favorite.<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< Date>

The store has everything and I couldn't wait to get there to get a new bowl. However, the line to check out was wrapped all the way to the back of the store it looked like there were 40 to 50 people in line. We put our purchases back and left.<//text>

Interesting and different Japanese market that's not your typical structured and exact setting as other chain markets. They have a second floor with many items from antiques, to hello kitty items to appliances.< /Review>

This Japanese Market has a wide variety of items, thank goodness they also have a translation in English, hahaha otherwise I would have been lost. They have the second floor also which I haven't yet visited but I'm very curious. The prices are very comparative and reasonable. The only complained I guess I would have is that there were only two Checkers open and they were like 7 to 10 of us in both lines. There is a lot of parking available.</text>

Marukai was better experience. Sad to see how it's changed.
Now prefer to go to Mitsuwa or Nijiya market.<//Review>

Needs to have a meat market. Couldnt even find a package of chicken wings In that place. I get it, it's a japanese store, but it would be nice to have a REAL MEAT DEPT. But whatever!</text>

Impressive selection. Nice area. Tons of merchandise. They sell food, seafood, and clothing. There are two floors but upstairs closes earlier than downstairs.

We were visiting from out of town but if we weren’t, we would certainly come here often.<//text>

< Review>
This is a neat place to shop if you’ve never been here. It has a really neat variety of items and food that you don’t see in normal stores. Everything comes from Japan and most of it is pretty awesome! The only thing I didn’t like is that they close the upstairs portion of the store an couple hours before the rest of the store. I wish that they’d put that in their info. The staff is pretty helpful and nice though! And I really love a lot their products!<//Review>

Great selection I wish I had a tour guide in there! I literally hadn't seen 60% of the stuff they have in there. The fish selection is crazy and they have awesome meat as well. You can buy top end blue fin tuna for sushi and sashimi and high end A5 Japanese waygu beef too!</Text>

<Review>Love this place. It's not as spacious and abundant as it was before new ownership, but still pretty good. Prices went up a bit but they still have fantastic bargains on fresh produce, accessories, kitchenware and more.  On busy days/times checkout lines can get pretty long, so try going in the morning on a weekday.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Such a great spot. Stellar variety, whether you're looking for food, tea, alcohol, soaps... you name it. They also did some renovations last year to make it even more roomy on the inside and it's great. Staff is always helpful. Cafeteria is also pretty solid.<//review>< name>

TCM. Daisuki! If you like japanese grocery stores you must go to this one. If you have relatives here from Japan, then they might need things from here. It's great for all folks. Get some lunch there. Shop for groceries or a shrine. Great tableware...they have lots. Just go there!<//text>

Has basic everyday household Japanese appliances, rice cooker, humidifier, hot water maker, dishes, cups, and a bunch of other cute useful Japanese things you want but you don't need. Awesome food selection, lots of reasonably priced fresh vegetables and fruit. Has organics and imports from Japan. Fresh fish from Japan and local, at reasonable prices. The meat selection is amazing the best meat you could probably get anywhere. The snacks and all Japanese ingredients you need they will have it at a good price.

They also have a food court area if you come during the busy hours of the day. The pork buns are amazing. Sometimes it gets busy so pick wisely what time if the day you decided to go. The structure is difficult to get in on Artesia. I use to pass it a few times before i was able to identify it. It's surrounded by a green fence all around.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I come here regularly for the prepared foods: sushi, rice bowls, onigiri, umami fried chicken. You can buy smaller packages of fresh produce, like half heads of napa and kabocha. Nice selection of rice cakes today, for New Year's. Use the self checkout lanes for faster checkout.</Text>

It was our 1st visit: it has an over abundance of merchandise from plush toys, seafood, small appliances, clothes, furniture, everyday food, jewelry repair, & small food court. It's great! The staff is polite and friendly. I did give it on 4 stars, there are some items reasonably priced, but most are expensive for this fixed income gal. Planning a visit: bring plenty of spending money, extra time, & walking shoes! It's a pleasant visit.</review>

<review>It's sorta like this other Tokyo Central I've visited, but this place is enormous... A second floor?!
Seriously, it's large enough for one to play a good game of tag, if they wanted... And well, it's quite nice to get a taste of another country's culture, but man, is it pricey as always!
Just make sure you have money on you before you enter! It's well worth visiting.</review><Time>1535401166545</Time></record></dataset><record>

Love it. We spent hours browsing around every corner of this market, because not only do they sell food, but you can also buy personal and collective items if you are into japanese culture. They also sell antiques but they are quite expensive</review>

<text>I just love Marukai (forever will i call it that!) Love exploring and finding new things. Fresh veggies, fruits, love their snacks, love the whole grocery part. Also prepared food selection is great. Meat dept is small but has good quality meat. The food court is slowly coming back. The Tokyo croissant place is awesome! If you love the Japanese culture, then come to this place. You'll have fun exploring everything. This Marukai is one of the largest so try to get to this one. Also don't forget the upstairs! Furniture, clothes and more!<//text><Rating>5</Rating><username>Tammy Hasara</username>< Gmap_id>

<review>Marukai is now Tokyo Marketplace.  The store is being remodeled and all of the food stalls are closed. The layout of the store has changed and it is more open than before.  There are signs describing what is in the aisle.  Once the remodeling is done I hope the food court will be back in operation.</review>< Pics>

This place was originally known as Marukai, I'm not sure when they changed the name. Inside you can find a couple small restaurants, groceries, and novelty products.

Downstairs, they have a large selection of meats, vegetables and drinks/beer. Also available are many Japanese snacks and candy (these alone make a trip worth it in my opinion).

Upstairs, their products range from furniture to figurines. They have a lot of novelty and comfort items, including the full size pajamas with a hood known as kigurumi, and blind boxes containing random cute figurines.

This store can make for a fun browsing experience, and can also satisfy a grocery trip. I can only caution that with all of the neat things they have here is that you might spend more money than you plan to.</review>

My husband and my experience was good. We founded some products we use. Such as pork belly and small packages of baby back ribs.  Latose free milk , etc. Plenty of different sea foods.  Whole red snapper.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. We will visit the store again.</text>

<Text>I've been going here since I was young and I love it. You do need a membership to buy anything. All the food is mostly Japanese. Upstairs they have furniture and clothes. They do sell sake/alcohol. There's a small restaurant inside when you first walk in. It's a nice Japanese grocery store to go to once in a while if you don't live close to one like I do.<//Text><user_id>101883367653972105627<//user_id><username>Tiffany Dooland</username><rating>5< /rating></record>

As it's probably been already said, this is the Costco of Japanese goods. For a few minutes, it makes me believe I'm back im Japan. Selection is amazing, prices are good. The prepared foods used to be lacking, but since the remodel, the selection is greatly improved. A nice bonus: The food court amazing kara-age and takoyaki.< /text>

I love this Japanese market. It is HUGE. The sushi section is awesome. It rivals any restaurant sushi for 2/3 of the price. Fresh and yummy. Besides all the great Japanese and Hawaiian grocery items they have a whole area with plates, rice cookers, and kitchenware as well as a gift and pop toy section upstairs. They also have a wellness area.

I also like the fresh mochi and desserts they each week from Fugetsu Do and the hot food restaurants inside. From karage to Gindaco, a ramen place, a tonkatsu place, and a Japanese pastry shop. They also have a croquette and onigiri deli in the corner as well as karage.

If you want bug cuts of fish for sushi, simply go to the butchery in the back of the store.

The Tokyo Central in Torrance is much smaller and driving to the one in Gardena is worth it.<//text>

I recommend this place especially for anyone that cooks, and is looking for Japanese ingredients.  The perishables here are generally more fresh than what you're likely to find at similar Japanese markets in the area.  You can also find prepared food, kitchen goods, cosmetics, and various knickknacks all in one convenient location.
Note though that the discounted prices throughout the market require a membership card at the cost of $1 (with no recurring fees).</Review>

So far I'd say this place has the best takoyaki in Los Angeles area! The size of the takoyakis are bigger than the usual which is a plus. They're made to order so they're very fresh. Most places serve the takoyaki with the insides slightly undercooked and way too soft but this place does it right!<//review>

< review>
This place has everything you can think of for a Japanese market. It's really a mega store. Deli, fresh sushi counter, a few fast food stands, inside & outside eating areas, grocery store with impressive selections of Japanese goods, very fresh produce, well stocked liquor area (could not find Okinawan saki unfortunately). The downstairs also houses a separate cosmetics section, it is so big it is a little overwhelming & I honestly didn't know what half the stuff was meant for since I'm not able to read the letters. It also has a separate appliances area with rice cookers and small things like that. The upstairs has all the fun stuff. Things like kimonos (some moderate priced used ones) wooden sandals, cute hair clips, Zen gardens, lucky cats, dolls, trinkets, stuffed animals, crazy socks, kigurumi (onesies), costumes, models, Pokemon stuff.
Also, everyone that works here is super helpful if you have questions about anything so don't hesitate to ask.
Overall, you could spend a few hours exploring this place, shopping, having lunch & have a great time doing it.<//review>

If you don't read Japanese it's somewhat difficult to navigate this store. The layout is much better organized than the former Marukai Market. Produce is high quality and less expensive than neighboring Albertsons and the Hawaiian section very good as well.</Review>

Love this place. The offer some great deals you always have to be on your toes to snatch them up, because the will be gone quick. Fairly prices produced and you will always find something new and exotic.< /text>

< Review>
Went in Tokyo central Market place of business in Uniform to get change for $5.
My badge in clear sight.

As I approached the register,
i noted there was a guest services.

There were 2 women there.

I spoke to the older of the 2.

Without hesitation she quickly replied no.

I noted the registers all around were giving change.

I repeated are you sure?

She did not give a reason.
For example,

I had to " Purchase" something,
or it's their policy not to give Change!

She did neither, nor offer any explanation.

Her eyes and Body language suggested me out the door quickly.
I am on duty,
well groomed, dressed in uniform.

The wrong nationality in my opinion.

As I sit here writing this,
I can still see the the look in her eyes.
Her body language left me feeling..

Like a Foreigner in his Homeland!

It's kind of ironic, as I was born
in Japan & am of Indian and English descent!
Therefore I am a Native to this land...

Tonight and throughout the holidays I will put the word out to my Family, Friends and the Department Not!

To shop @ Tokyo Central Market.

Probably one of the largest Japanese markets in the Southland. You can get anything from electric goods, rice cookers, air pots, Japanese style plates and bowls to produce, meat, seafood and just about every sauce and condiment used in Japanese cooking.< /Review>

<Text>I love to go there shopping for goodies from Japan and Hawaii. They have a food court there and love to eat quick lunch there. I also like to get quick sushi or bento for dinner while shopping for grocery there. Must go place to shop for meats for Chinese hotpot or Japanese shabu shabu there. Tokyo Central Market usually have better pricing than Nijiya or Mitsuwa.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Very nice Japanese store with lots of goodies. There is an upstairs so this place is pretty big. The only negative thing I would say about the store is ,the prices are really kinda on the high end. Very clean and very friendly staff.</Review>

<review>Our experience at the Okonomiyaki food court was the worst.    Awful tasting yakisoba and okonomiyaki my husband and I have ever tasted in all the years we’ve been enjoy eating them.  They do not seem to know the very basics of making an okonomiyaki  that truly
disappointed us.  Will never be going back!
Could’ve spent $35 on better tasting choice!!!
HORRIBLE!!!!</review>< Pics>

Has many of the things that those looking for Japanese will be able to find. Everything from tontatsu to kotatsu. If you are looking for prepared food stuffs like bento or onigiri, get there early as they tend to run out mid afternoon. But if you happen to miss out, there is a food court where you can get your fix for takoyaki, donburi, ramen, etc</Review>

Great supermarket for Asian Produce, cookware and Food products.  My family has been going to Marukai ever since their previous location over 20+ years.  They have extensive variety here on all types of foods including Fresh fish, Cooked foods, drinks, Desserts, Vegetables, and condiments.< /Text>

I also like to get quick sushi or bento for dinner while shopping for grocery there. Must go place to shop for meats for Chinese hotpot or Japanese shabu shabu there. Tokyo Central Market usually have better pricing than Nijiya or Mitsuwa.</review>< rating>

There are also a few restaurants in the front entry of the grocery store and they each are awesome. They have a japanese fried chicken spot there that is OMG good food.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>THE PLASE for most everything you need  from Japan in huge space.  foods and living needs but most I recomend are the beauty needs for girls! You find most interesting updated things here for makeups and Body care. Expect to spend hours once you get in but make sure you are  equipped with interpretation somehow if you want to find each products instructions but it worth doing that if you know the quality of them. You need time and a little extra money to go there.</text>< pics>

Be careful when buying prepared fried food. Some may be burnt and greasy. Mileage may vary. Continuous remodeling-head up, things move around some. Nice place to shop for items. Know your prices on non Asian items, some things are higher than expected.<//text>

It had a little bit of everything. So there's an appreciation for them having a place to get groceries, and other random household tidbits. There's even a small section for Gundam kits. What made this place amazing was the Gindaco that's near the entrance, truly delicious takoyaki. I will recommend this place just based on that eatery.<//Review>

Tips:

sushi section gets discounted from the market price (15%, 20% and 30% ) few hours before the end of day. )

<Review>This is large supermarket packed with asian groceries. They have monthly events usually themed with certain produces, region from Japan or festival theme. Its very fun to try out imported lical Japanese food. The location also has a large area where they sell Japanese goods that are handy for many people. Also they have packed lunch, side dish, and snacks that you can pick up.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Time>1516144188993<//Time><Rate>4<//Rate><user_id>113151676765058026686</user_id></record></dataset><record>

garbage i got followed around by some lady that worked there and then eventually she kept telling me to leave i literally had done nothing at all, i got in line to pay and when instead of forcing me to leave when i first went into the line the lady decided to wait until i was right about to pay and then start to tell me to leave again and then grab my basket and take it away<//Review>

Great shop for asain foods and things you wont find in other stores, hige selection of mushrooms and veggies, they have a massive sushi bar of fresh made sushi as long as the butcher counter in any other grocery store. There are also a few restaurants in the front entry of the grocery store and they each are awesome. They have a japanese fried chicken spot there that is OMG good food.<//review>

Great place to go for Asian style things that you cannot get it to regular grocery store have a lot of different items you can find tofu at a grocery store if they have 20 different tofu's and find Asian style vegetables on that is without cutting Meats they also have a deli that you can get fresh sushi and other Asian style cuisine very good place to go and have lunch there too< /review>

<text>I'm a Hawaii native, so I've been exposed to a lot of American-Japanese food/culture/etc, and this place is easily the BEST Japanese market I've ever been to. If you're into Hawaiian food, there's multiple aisles of stuff I've literally never seen outside of Hawaii before --- authentic portugeuse sausage, lau lau, every single type of sugary drink (POG, passion orange, etc), even frozen Zippys meals (!!!)

From a Japanese standpoint, everything is not only directly imported, but there are little English descriptions of all the foods on the price labels. All the staff are super courteous, and the food court attached is out of this world!

A real shining star here is the sushi --- it's cheaper, fresher, and tastier than you'll be able to get anywhere else that I've ever seen. There's also an authentic Japanese curry stand in the back corner where you can get all kinds of amazing curry dishes. The food court has some of the best karaage chicken I've ever had, and this is the first time I've seen an authentic takoyaki stand in LA.

All in all, amazing service, amazing prices, and a must-go for anybody who loves Japanese food.</text>< pictures>

Marukai is the place to go to for all your Japanese & Hawaiian grocery needs. They are a good deal cheaper than Mitsuwa and have a far greater selection. Make sure to jump in their website to look at their weekly deals, because you can find some huge savings on highly sought after items.< /Text>

< Review>
At the beginning me & my Family were excited to come here since it's no longer Marukai. The employees we're unwelcoming & unhelpful contrast to the Marukai we knew before. Furthermore we will now be shopping at Daiso & Ranch Market where it won't be ackward cuz your not ASAIN & shopping at these stores. Such a let down SMH....<//Review>

Lots of household goods as well as groceries. Produce is generally quite fresh. Good seafood section. Tends to be overcrowded and can be hard to find your way around.<//Review>

<review>Tokyo Central, my favorite Japanese grocery store is the mother of all Japanese supermarkets having not only the first floor w/ mostly comestibles & dry goods, but also having a second floor that specializes in furniture & Japanese objets d'art.

Nijiya is a good place to run in fast to get a few items, but for  the sheer variety of goods such as reasonable cosmetics, Sakè (sah keh), Japanese beers, Sho-chu-/Japanese lower alcohol Vodkas, snacks, produce, Japanese food in cans, frozen, plastic, produce Tokyo Central can't be beat.

There is something for everybody, at least for those interested in Japanese products.  If you're in here for the first time prepare to stay for about an hour to see what is available & acquant yourself to the layout. The proof is in the pudding; you have to go there.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2b56685ac2169:0xae5fe05abe26b2<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Boo to memberships. That being said, you can still enter and purchase items without a membership. They will charge an extra dollar and you don’t get the sale prices, but at least you can still shop. They have one day memberships available if needed. The top floor is filled with Japanese items such as traditional clothing, furniture and unique décor items and the main floor is filled to the brim with Japanese and Hawaiian groceries. On weekends there are sample food carts dishing out simple Japanese dishes to try. The food court is small but sufficient. Avoid at all costs around New Years.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This place has it all as far as a Japanese style market goes.

It has all the dry goods to make whats popular at home. All the frozen goods to take home and eat and also a nice little fiod court area to get some pretty decent food.

The Store also has a floral area and a toys/Japanese hobby section even have the paints you need to paint them. Pretty cool!

There lots of cool japanese nicknacks and little gifts if you want to gift some one something cool.

The makeup area is massive. I think this is the second biggest part of the store. Ir has everything iou would need as far as makup is concerned. Cheap too. I mean its not a Sephora but you get the picture.

There is a ready food are that is nice to pick up a quick sushi roll or even a nagiri or rice roll. Im surprised i never have been here sooner. I always just go to Marukai, But this place I beleive is a branch off of Marukai in Torrance. So a hit!

If your looking for something Japanese. This is the place. For sure!</Review>

Large Japanese store that has groceries, electronics, and a lot of other consumer stuff. If you ever want to see one of the fabled Japanese toilets, there are a number of display models on the second floor to examine.<//review>

<review>Very bad, looks to be under new ownership and not doing well. The store layout has been ruined and shopping in a majority of the store is impossible. The products seen to be the same or similar to one the previous Marukai carried. I do not recommend shopping during busy hours.</review>< pics>

They have POG. I love Hawaii and I love Hawaiian Mai Tais and the best ones are made with the truly Hawaiian drink of POG. I scoured the internet trying to find a place in SoCal (Los Angeles area) I could get POG and someone recommendes Marukai, and sure enough, they have it! Besides the original POG brand, they even have another brand that is basically the same thing just in case. So excited to find POG in the LA area. Besides that this is a true Japanese market with all authentic imported Japanese (and some Hawaiian) foods.<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>5<//rate><Review>One of, if not THE, best Japanese supermarkets in the Los Angeles area. My family has been going here for years and, more often than not, we always find what we need. The prices can skew a little high on some items, I find that I can usually do my produce shopping elsewhere and save a little, but in general the prices are fine. It can get a little cramped inside on weekends and you should absolutely be prepared for a wait in the checkout line. For years I shopped at their satellite store in West Covina (closed now, sadly) and while it was much closer that was about the only thing it had up on the Gardena store. Consistently clean and, aside from one experience with a belligerent employee, the staff is great. I've tried most of their competitors over the years and have consistently come back to Marukai.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b56685ac2169:0xae5fe05abe26b2<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>This is one of the better Marukais. They have everything that you could want.  The service sucks, though.  It serves the Nisei (2nd gen) crowd vs Mitsuwa or Nijiya which serves more of the Issei (1st gen) or Japanese transplant crowd.
Marukai is generally the cheapest of the 3 Japanese market chains, but I feel that the quality also suffers a bit.  Korean markets are cheapest for pretty much everything, so if you have a good Korean market nearby, I would generally opt to go there over Marukai.<//Text><name>Lisa Umeda</name><UserId.>106039133754109375372<//UserId.><time>1483032341723</time>< response>

< review>
I heart Murakai so much. I am much closer to the Little Tokyo location, but what I love about the Gardena Murakai is that it is way bigger and never gets as crowded as the Little Tokyo one. (We all want to avoid that moment when you and an elderly lady are eyeing that last packet of whatever...and you briefly wonder if it's socially acceptable to elbow her out of the way.)

I usually pick up saimin ingredients, my favorite snacks, and other packaged items so I can't speak for any of the hot food or even packaged pastries there...but they always have what I need and then some. Sure, I need a mini stapler and a panda-shaped mug. Sure, I need taro pancake mix and strawberry Kit Kats. Why the eff not? The cashiers are super nice as well.

I did knock off a star because I happened to use the bathroom once and it was...not pretty. Also, the place in general is grungy (probably just old) but well-organized and the aisles are always clean.<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Very well stocked Japanese supermarket. They sell prepared food ready to go. You will find all kinds of ingredients to prepare traditional Japanese food. The food prepared while later it is, they lower the price as they do in the supermarkets in Japan. If you want to try traditional Japanese fast food this is the best place. I visited it with my nephews and we brought many snacks and instant soups to try at home, my nephews were delighted and we returned the next day to buy more. Due to the covid they offer masks to be able to enter in case they forgot. I found some merchandising products from Studio Ghibli. The supermarket is worth a visit. The next time I travel to Los Angeles I will visit them again.

Supermercado japonés muy bien surtido. Venden comida preparada lista para llevar. Encontrarán todo tipo de ingredientes para preparar comida tradicional japonesa. La comida preparada mientras más tarde es, le rebajan el precio como lo hacen en los supermercados en Japón. Si desean probar comida rápido tradicional japonesa este es el mejor lugar. Lo visité con mis sobrinos y llevamos muchos snacks y sopas instantaneas para probar en casa, mis sobrinos quedaron encantados y regresamos el día siguiente a comprar más. Por el covid ofrecen mascarillas para poder ingresar por si se les olvidó.  Encontré algunos productos merchandising de Studio Ghibli. Vale la pena visitar el supermercado. La próxima vez que viaje a Los Angeles volveré visitarlos.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The Japanese market
Other communities including Koreans
It is a popular place.
Price compared to the Korean market
Overall, it's expensive.
I often make promotions.
If you take advantage of that opportunity,
You can afford to buy.

일본 마켓이지만

가격은 한국 마켓에 비해

프로모션을 자주 하므로
그 기회를 이용하면 비교적
알뜰하게 구매할 수 있습니다.<//Review>

But it is not reflected in the map yet.
Well, I will go again next time, so I'll take photos and upload it at that time.
However, anyway, plain croissants are that size, with that crispness, and they are too happy about $ 1.80.
Bread was also the best. Together, I bought too much and exceeded $ 30 ...

Tokyo Central (formerly Marukai) has changed little. No matter when you go, you will be satisfied and a little dissatisfied. (Lol) Although it is natural, there is no choice but to be high in Japanese products, but if it is too expensive ... 
Also, are all the food court shops? It has changed. If there is a silver duck, if it is $ 6.50 it is a price you can buy without hesitating to that! I thought I was going to buy it, but a man in front of me asked something strangely and it took me a while (I was about to buy a couple of minutes, so nearly 5 minutes, I asked a clerk I was abandoned because there was not enough time.

No, Takoyaki, I thought that it was not so much trouble to buy ... But, if it was a stranger, I guess I have to ask them everything. 
If it is only ordinary Takoyaki, nobody needs to worry (mayonnaise it is not possible to wear it or not, is it about blue clouds?) Just looking at it, since various kinds of photographs were pasted, the first person It may be more annoying.

この中にできた新しいパン屋さん。というか、クロワッサン屋さん。最高です。
でもまだ、マップに反映されてないんだね。
じゃ、また今度行くから、その時は写真も撮ってアップします。
でも、とにかく、プレーンのクロワッサンが、あの大きさで、あのパリパリ感で、しかも、＄1.80とか、嬉しすぎる。
食パンも最高でした。ついつい、買いすぎて30ドル超えた・・・

東京セントラル（旧マルカイ）は、ほとんど変わってないかな。いつ行っても、満足するし、ちょっと不満足。（笑）あたりまえだけど、日本の商品が高いのは仕方ないんだけど、あまりに高額になっていると・・・
あと、フードコートのお店は全部？変わったんだね。銀だこがあって、＄6.50ならそこまで躊躇せずに買える値段だ！って思って買うつもりだったんだけど、私の前の男性がなにか異様に質問したりして、時間かかってて（私が買おうと後ろに並んでからゆうに5分近くは、店員さんに質問してた）時間がそこまでなかったのもあって、断念。

いや、たこ焼きって、そんなに悩んで買うしろもんじゃないだろ・・・って思いながら、でも、知らない人だったら、やっぱりいろいろと、聞かないといけないんだろうね。
普通のたこ焼きだけなら、誰も悩む必要ないけど（マヨネーズつけるかつけないかぐらい？青のりは？ってぐらいなのかな？）ぱらっと見ただけで、いろんな種類の写真が貼ってあったから、初めての人はなおさら悩むかもね。< /Text>< gmapID>
