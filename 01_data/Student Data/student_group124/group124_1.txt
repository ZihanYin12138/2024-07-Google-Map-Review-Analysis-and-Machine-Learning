<name>Anthony Chicoine</name>< review>
THE absolute WORST!  I went in to mail a package that falls under the category of being a “FLAT.”. Not a flat rate, a FLAT that is priced less expensively that a parcel.  “Miss Attitude” insisted it was a package and refused to acknowledge the PRINT OUT from the USPS website I showed her that proved my package was a flat.  I even showed her a package I received that was labeled “FLAT” and when I pointed this out the manager yelled at me from the top of her lungs that the sender had “Gotten away with murder!”. Seriously?  I took it to another post office, used the self service kiosk and mailed it with the correct “FLAT” postage rate and it arrived no problem.  Avoid this location at all costs.  Just a lot of mouthy, rude and disgruntled employees.</review>

<text>I came here at exactly 4pm on Sept 23rd, 2020. I waited in line for more than 5 minutes but less than 10. I finally left as I realized it would take another 10+ min in line. No biggie. However... one of the four USPS people working the windows was NOT wearing a mask the entire time. Not even a mask hanging down her chin or neck. NOTHING! She was dealing with a customer who was wearing a mask as was everyone else at the branch - except for this employee. This is unacceptable.<//text><user_id>112737951767955283099</user_id>< rate>

I would not recommend dropping off your packages at this location. I used the drop box and was informed that it could “take a while” to scan the packages. Mine have not been scanned after dropping them off a week ago.</text>

< Review>
Please educate your employees on the specific parameters of your flat rate packages. For the first time in years, this clueless woman decided to try and tell me that flat rate envelopes must be flat. That is not not the case, as verified by your website and corporate representatives. The package cannot  e reconstructed, though can be reinforced at seams with tape,  but there are no thickness limitations as long as the vessel still seals at the same spot that was intended.

She's returned a bunch of orders to me that had guarenteed delivery dates, as well as a $30 priority Express shipment she KNEW was for my mothers birthday the next day. She also knew that I had paid more for a padded express envelope, but you were out of them. She agreed to accept it, scanned it, then returned it to me anyway, knowing its importance as i sat there waiting to receive her confirmation it would arrive as planned. Now, she's robbed me of that $30 since the parcel was scanned, and therefore cannot be voided. Not to mention the nighmare shes caused in damage control and making this right with my customers.

EDUCATE. PLEASE.</Review>

This is a great post office.
Cherokee is the black hole where parcels disappear and never see the light if day again not this office.

Be patient be kind to the staff.

I was there the other day and only one person on staff! That's hardly fair.<//text>

I was ini here last Saturday, June 22 at 11:15AM and this girl Tia who I guess is new acted like a total animal. Practically threw my package at me. Extremely rude. Clearly hates her job. Didn't give me any label to fill out. Clearly making more work for her co-workers because after her emotional episode, she retreated to the back. I guess she was embarassed, as she should have been. Not sure how she carries herself through the world with such a low vibe but. It made my soul cringe. Her colleague Maria was very helpful though.<//review>

<Text>If you go early, it's a good experience. Parking can be a hassle, sometimes I have to circle around the block for 5-10 minutes before finding a space. But the tellers are friendly if you go prepared with your shipment already packaged up, and labeled correctly. If you go early, you're in and out in 5 minutes.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Incredibly rude, the amount of attitude is staggering! One employee doesn't know anything (to any of my questions she replies "oh I dont know why"), the other young girl rolls her eyes when I ask her for a form that is not on the table where all the labels & forms are suppose to be, she could have given it to me since it is withing her hand reach, but no, with hand wave "off you go" and condescending tone she tells me to talk to the superviser. Worst post office I've ever been to.< /Review>

<time>1491065838405< /time><rate>1<//rate><text>This is the ONLY post office I have ever been to in my life that actually was out of stamps! Pretty much the only thing they do really...sort of like a restaurant being open but once you wait in line for an hour for a table the waiter tells you they have no food to sell you!

You know this is a government post office because all the employees are black women checking their phones or talking to each other while the line grows longer.

They have also been out of money orders on 3 separate occasions. Sure they will tell you where you can get them...another post office but pretty much not the point.

Terrible customer service...in fact, there is no customer service.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I saw two black ladies assaulting elderly white woman who was complaining about not receiving her mail for over two months. She had a very heavy yet understandable accent.
It appears that both employees were joking about her broken English constantly implying that she did not understand what they were telling her. Actually none of the people waiting to get service seemed not understanding why one could not get his mail for such prolonged period of time either.
If you can use other location, do not go to this one. It is not the first time I see them not doing their gob properly.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2bec5b0bb4def:0x944a7d015e3f07c6</gmapID>< user>

I have honest to God never seen such bad customer service. I've been coming here for several years now, in that time I've seen the clerks act like they are not there to serve. I've seen them yell at customers, rudely ignore their counter to talk to each other and ignore customers while clearly still on duty but not working, and even threaten to call police (for genuinely easy situations that could have been defused with the slightest amount of customer service skill). It should be filmed it's so bad. I've also see them open up as late as 9:20 (20 min late) and have the nerve to yell at upset customers who had to wait, with no explanation given.</review>

It's unfortunate but this is a terrible post office but they don't care because they don't get paid enough so I understand. If you're super lazy and you need a job this is the place to go. I know someone that works here they told me they pretend the mail drum is broken and they just put this mail cart out for people to put their packages in, and many packages have been stolen because of this but again they don't care. If you really want to make a difference in this place take a few minutes to write the postmaster.</review>

The incident occurred near 5pm on 4/19/16. We were about 5 people waiting in line for at least 20 minutes and only 2 employees working at the time. Right before 5pm a new costumer arrives and this employee that was in the lobby about to close the door decides to help this new costumer before everyone else in line. At first, I thought she was just answering a question but then I see this employee bring a wireless credit card machine and doing a transaction with this new costumer. I looked at the guy behind me and he had witnessed the same thing.
He approaches this employee to ask her why is she helping this costumer when she had people waiting in line for over 20 minutes? The employee starts yelling at him "if you don't like it you can go home" "get back in line or go home" "get back in line or go home" I could not believe what I was witnessing.

She proceeds to lock up the post office since it was 5pm and goes back inside. Before going back to her desk she made sure to change the radio station to find something she liked as we were all still waiting for her.

When I come in to her window I asked for her name to which she responds "why do you want my name for" I said "I need your name to report your behavior" to which she says "I won't give you my name, I won't give you my name" The guy behind me asked to speak to a manager. There was no manager on site, she started yelling again that she won't give me her name. I took her picture since she would not give me her name and she went crazy closing the window on me and telling me to "get the hell out of here or I will call the police" She kept yelling at me "get out of here, get out of here". After almost 30 min waiting in line I could not send my mail because she returned my mail to me.

She followed me to unlock the door and says "you are lucky I did not call the police on your ass".

I am beyond alarmed and disappointed that the USPS will hire people like her. Her behavior is unacceptable and she is definitely not qualified to for this job. She should be fired.< /Text>

<Date>1487889250179<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I've been doing logistics for a small  vintage film poster business as well as personal assistant postal runs for seven years now since moving to Hollywood. I'm only writing to rebuke all these reviews about "nasty attitudes" and "poor customer service". First of all, this location is in the middle of Hollywood; primadonas and wannabes abound. I've seen such impatience and hostility from customers that I understand why the ladies here don't take any mistreatment! And rightfully so because most people who end up making a scene are NOT PREPARED, have no clue what they need, and really are inconsiderate when they are addressed as people and not special snowflakes or aspiring models/actors/artists/whatever. The amount of egotistical and ignorant customers this location sees daily is staggering. I've never been disrespected, and only once was there a mistake with a mailing and it was partially my fault. I don't know what the point of writing reviews for a post office is, but I've never had a problem that could not be resolved by communicating with RESPECT. You can only push people so far before they build up a resistance to such negativity. I love coming here, they know me by name and make me feel welcome.</Review>< pics>

That's NOT an USPS requirement, she just made it up! She refused to provide the service, refused to introduce herself, refused to call for a manager and kicked out my package out of the window. Just imagine, she is getting paid for that!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< review>
If I could use a less than zero I would. The Post office I am complaining about it at 458 N DOHENY DR
WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA 90048-9997--but the web site (ALSO BROKEN) directed me here. I sent a first class letter to a P.O. Box in the VERY SAME POST OFFICE meaning the letter had to travel presumably about 20 feet. It took 15 days for my landlord to get the letter--with my rent check--threatening my lease agreement. He made me make out another check with money I did not have and PERSONALLY deliver it to him. Then canceling the first check. I COULD HAVE GOT THIS LETTER TO HIM FASTER IF I HAD TIED IT TO THE WING OF A WOUNDED CARRIER PIGEON!!! If this is "First Class Mail" I wonder how long 2nd or 3rd class would take? Two or three years maybe? The United States has not become a Third World country--its become a Tenth World Country.< /review>

<Review>If I could give this post office less than one star, I would. I went in to give them business, and they were rude and disrespectful. When I told them about the good customer service I received from the South Pasadena Post Office, I was told to go back to South Pasadena by the supervisor. Another employee chimed in, yeah, go back to South Pasadena. What a bunch of jerks.</Review>< Pics>

Worst post office ever! One never walks into a post office expecting any form of customer service anyway, but I'm pretty sure this branch makes it a priority to leave your day worse off than when you walked in! Also, don't bother trying to call them directly because you will never get through, ever. (Called 26 times, 26! Between 9-5 never got through)<//Text>

I have been a customer of H&R block for over 30 yrs. I am completely thrilled with the service. The only flaw is the price.  A single tax return has increased since the year before.</Text>

<review>Raj was extremely helpful during free consultation,  really went above and beyond to explain our deductions and w4 mistakes. Prepared me and my wife for 2021. Great experience strongly recommended for novice tax filers who are unsure of certain tax stuff..lol..<//review>< pictures>

Last week, I called in and made an appointment with Carmen. I told her about my situation and asked for pricing up front. She told me it would be 180 cause my tax is a little complicated. I go in there, and I tried to reconfirm what we discussed. She said it would now be 300. When I asked how it went up, she said it's more complicated and there are things she would need to do to make sure I get the most of my return....horrible</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1551301958138, 'text': 'Rahim - thank you for your feedback!

I was extremely overcharged for a Minsk service and feel completely taken advantage of. I’m not sure how $169 turns into $363 with just 1 w-2 and no other forms that need to be input. I will never be back.</review>

I love Sally's I shop there so much I'll have like 5 reviews stack up at one time. I can find any thing I need for my hair in one place. I'm a natural 4c girl if that helps.< /Review>

<text>Fine place, fine people, well organized. The stock is rotated regularly, so you don't wind up with old expired product. They have loyalty cards, specials, good online service, great selection AND are prompt at getting special orders in stock. Their pricesare competitive with even the big-box stores. I find that if you need specific knowledge about product and technique it's best to go weekdays during business hours and to find one of the more experienced employees....there are one or two in particular at my locale who are VERY knowledgeable. They respect the customer's needs and their pocketbook. I have NEVER had anything less than a good experience, and they've never sent me away with more than I need.< /text>< Name>

<Text>This place is awesome Generally speaking. There are better locations as far as Attitude goes. I love how they exchange anything if you're not happy with it, like shampoo. The saying is true, Attitude is EVERYTHING! So to all Managers who are in charge of training should firmly stress to all employees the importance of friendliness first and foremost for the success of each establishment!< /Text>< pictures>

It must be a requirement to have a nasty attitude to work at Sally's.
Here's some free advise find a job that doesn't require you to provide customer service.</Text>

I love this Sally's store, the manager here is always so helpful. Today I went in to make an exchange, but I couldn't find my receipt, so this manager went into her computer and found it for me. She made the exchange for with no problem.<//review>

< Review>
HORRIBLE customer service. They claimed I could not use my 15% off coupon that expires today at midnight because it was expired or redeemed. Their clerk informed me that if I eas a Sally member there was posdibly a coupon and waited for me to open me email. She WATCHED me open up my email!!! When her register did not want to accept the coupon snd she asked her co-worker to help her over ride, the co worker called the manager and stated I probably already used my coupon. Seriously, the clerk is the one that prompted me to search my email. I clearly had not used it. I walked out of the store snd told her I would be contacting their corporate office for such ridiculous service!!</Review>

My childhood disdain for dental visits were completely eliminated because of how personable and competent professionals all working together very cohesively so ensure I experienced ZERO PAIN and discomfort during the entire procedure. The end product is a beautiful smile that has me meeting people with confidence and gratitude for Dr. Jeremy Chau and everyone at Platinum Braces! Thank you.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
I didn't have a single staff member that wasn't friendly and helpful. Over the years of going there, they got to know me and my growing family. Jeremy Chau, the orthodontist, was very professional yet personable and funny. He was very attentive to my needs and any complaints and didn't judge me when I kept breaking things he just installed. Absolutely great experience and glad I picked them.</Review>

Dr. Chau was professional, kind, and answered all the questions my husband and I had. He went above and beyond for us and we love that about him! We had a great experience being a patient at the office and can’t recommend it enough!! The staff is also very accommodating and friendly. Overall, we love Dr. Chau, the staff, and the whole vibe of the office.</Review>

<review>Having braces during covid probably would have been a challenge but Dr. Jeremy was so attentive and provided quality care. He was quick to respond to all questions and concerns and my teeth are better than perfect. My smile is full of confidence and care because of Dr. Jeremy and his dedication to braces. I recommend him and his team to everyone who needs braces! Best care during and after!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I wouldn’t think I’d be posting a review about an orthodontist, but that’s how blown away I was by Dr. Ven Dange. I came in for a consultant and to begin Invisalign treatment. Dr. Ven Dange was incredibly amiable, patient, kind, and answered all of my questions (and I had a ton of questions!). She is clearly a very competent and knowledgeable practitioner. Can’t wait to keep coming back to her, and seeing the improvement in my smile. I highly recommend her to all of my family and friends who are interested in fixing their teeth.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dcb75e4f9c221b:0x4761e3dc94ec563e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We were referred to this orthodontic place  by a very good friend. Dr. Melissa Ven Dange is truly amazing! My daughter has acute anxiety around dentists and Dr. Ven Dange and her staff have been incredibly patient, kind and helpful throughout our braces experience. My daughter is not an easy patient and Dr. Ven Dange has taken every bit of her resistance and fear with the highest level of respect, professionalism and expertise in working with children. She also is very detailed oriented and thorough with her work.

We’ve had nothing but great experiences with every staff member as well. Their patients and understanding have helped my daughter become more confident and less fearful with each dental visit. As a parent, I really appreciate the extra effort that Dr. Ven Dange and her staff put into making our braces experience positive and productive.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My experience with Jeremy Chau was nothing short of amazing, I looked forward to every visit I had with him for almost 2 years due to his optimism and dedication to work. Compared to my previous orthodontist, Mr. Chau was a breath of fresh air, making a more comfortable and friendly environment with his lively presence. I'm extremely grateful to have gone through the process with him and definitely would recommend him to anyone looking forward to braces! :)<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Platinum Braces is FANTASTIC!  My experience as a 56 year old woman getting braces was a bit uncomfortable, but Dr. Chau made me feel so comfortable!  He is always ready for my appointments, I appreciate how he respects my time as valuable.  He is so friendly and so gentle.  He e plains things well and always makes my follow up appts himself.  My teeth are straight as can be and beautiful!  I highly recommend Dr. Chau and Platinum Braces!</review><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcb75e4f9c221b:0x4761e3dc94ec563e</GmapID>< user_id>

<review>Dr. Jeremy Chau is the best in his field. The care and attention he gives to each patient is superb. I am thankful that during the difficult time of the Pandemic Dr. Chau was there to provide me with my orthodontic needs. He is personal and outcoming all while maintaining professionalism.  I am excited to have my braces removed to reveal my new perfect smile.
Thanks Dr. Chau you are the amazing.</review>< Pics>

Dentistry requires patience, skill, and a unique type of artistry that I believe Dr. Jeremy Chau possesses. He takes the time to truly educate his patients and explain in detail what is going on with their teeth.

Most importantly, he passes my 3 tests: 1) He appears very down to earth and someone I can easily converse with 2) I would send family members to him for dental care 3) His pursuit of excellence in his craft and patient care is unrivaled.

<Review>Dr. Chau, Patricia, and the team are my favorite Ortho group thus far! They care about the needs of the patient and all have warm, welcoming personalities. At each appt I always know exactly what to expect and they respect my time. And, with their affordable treatment cost I’d recommend them to everyone.</Review>< Pics>

<Time>1597242214176</Time><rating>5<//rating><Text>I absolutely love this office, the Doctors truly care about their patients. I waited so many years to get braces because (1): I didnt have the time for it and (2) I was afraid of how they would look and feel. The staff made me feel comfortable. Dr. Chau is very knowledgeable and knows exactly what to do to have your smile "flexing". I am glad to say that my braces are actually beautiful and the experience has been great so far, mostly because of the care I receive here. I usually walk straight to the back and the couple of times I've had to wait, has been less than 5 minutes. As a person that works 60+ hours a week and only one day off, this is huge! I highly recommend this office.< /Text>< Pictures>

Highly recommend this place, specifically Dr. Jeremy Chau!

My son previously had retainers from another place and unfortunately lost it. We didn't like their customer service, never did, so we decided now would be a good time to try another place. We took our son to Dr. Jeremy Chau and I'm so happy we did. My 11-year-old son even said "everyone's so much nicer here". We felt comfortable with dr. Jeremy and felt like we could trust him with our kids immediately, which is rare. My son said his new retainers are A LOT more comfortable than the ones he had before.

We drove all the way from Orange County to Corona Hills just to see Dr. Jeremy and definitely do not regret it. Totally worth the drive. Recommend 10000%.<//text>

I am so thankful for my experience with Dr. Jeremy Chau. My experience has been nothing short of amazing. I felt everything handled with professionalism & hospitality from the start up process with billing to getting them on & even now that I go to my check ups with him & his assistant Patricia. They’re my go to’s & have always taken great care of me. For being 9AM appointments before work  or days where I get lucky and it’s my day off it’s always so pleasant to see them. Dr. Chau has walked me through my entire process with great understanding and my results have been better than I expected. Thank you guys! You guys will always have my referral to anyone I know in need of a great Dr & staff.< /Review>

I had the pleasure of work with Jeremy. He was my daughters orthodontist while he was here in NY at NYU Dental. My daughter had very crowded teeth when she first began 3 years ago. Jeremy was very friendly and patient with her and was excellent in every step of the process. I would definitely recommend him to anyone. He truly is one of the best. My daughter recently got her braces removed and we are beyond happy with the result.< /text>

<text>I met Jeremy when he just started at the NYU College of Dentistry. Over the 4 years that I have been going to him, he has been professional and adept in his work. I have always felt that I was working with a knowledgeable practitioner and he was communicative during every visit, assuring me that each step we were taking was the right one. I had a serious crossbite and overcrowding issue which he meticulously studied and devised an optimal treatment plan which I am continually pleased with. His careful work gave me the confidence to smile again. 😁<//text>< date>

I recently completed my Invisalign treatment with Dr. Chau and I am beyond happy with the results! He is extremely thorough, transparent, and caring. He did a great job explaining every step of the process and ensured I was comfortable and happy with the treatment plan. He was transparent about cost, and defined in detail each of the fees included on the bill so there were no surprises! Most importantly, he was such a pleasure to work with. He genuinely cared about my treatment progress and regularly checked in to see if I was happy with how my teeth were turning out. 10/10; would recommend! Thank you for my beautiful smile, Dr. Chau!< /review>

My 11 years old son is a patient at NYU school of dentistry. We had the pleasure of having Jeremy as his orthodontist until he graduated. He’s very patient, great customer care service. He explains every procedure in details and make sure you understand. He also answered all my questions. We had nothing but great experience at all of our visits. Jeremy is exceptional. I would recommend his service to everyone who’s in search of a dentist.< /review>

<text>Would highly recommend. I was a little nervous to have my teeth done as I felt I only needed minor adjustments, but Dr. Jeremy was always very easy to reach and took ample time on the phone to explain everything out to me each time I called. In addition, after shopping around his prices were by far the most reasonable.</text>< username>

If I could give Dr. Jeremy Chau 10 stars I would. Thank you Jeremy for making me feel so comfortable with my smile and for always being so honest at every visit. I used to dread going to the dentist (don’t lie, you do too) but because of him I feel so beautiful again.

10/5 would recommend!</text>

Jeremy is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING at his job. I went from looking like a 2 with some crooked bottom teeth to a solid 7.5 with his assistance. 10/10 would recommend if you are in need of an enthusiastic & diligent orthodontist. I can finally FLEX my new smile on the gram!<//Review>

Sometimes when I get a haircut here it’s pretty good. Other times it comes out terrible. I asked for a quarter of an inch on top and the lady cut off like an inch and a half! The lady also cut my side burns uneven and pushed my hairline back when I didn’t even ask for it. I don’t want to play Russian Roulette with my hair each time I come here. Prepare yourself, the cut may come out good or bad.< /text>

Do NOT come here for your haircut!!! Should have left when the first stylist kept stalling,  because he didn’t want to cut my hair. He kept going to the bathroom until the second stylist finished the client she had and finally said it was my turn. When I said I would like my hair texturized with a razor, she replied that she didn’t have a razor and pointed to her very basic tool set. I have never known a stylist not to have a razor as part of their styling arsenal. This is when I should have ran out the door! But, I stayed...thinking it would be ok, because the stylist was nice.  She just wasn’t very good.  One inch became 3-4 inches and my hair is uneven in a few spots.  There’s a Fantastic Sam’s on Imperial and that’s where I should have gone. They had far better reviews and hopefully aren’t discriminatory.<//Text>

Horrible service👎🏼. I arrived at 9am for a possible ear infection. I was there till 1:30 and i still had not been attended. Do NOT come to this clinic if you value your time and money! they were gonna take longer so i had to ask for my money back and they rudely gave it back. Never AGAIN !! 👎🏼👎🏼<//Review>

<review>don’t give them attitude back or they might drop you as a patient, if you really think it’s worth going there just bite your tounge even if they’re treating you sarcastically and making faces and almost degrading you. Just know there are better services out there. Not worth the time. I’ve been coming here since I had my child because it’s where they sent me and I wish I changed sooner. They are there for a reason and they should be able to relay information politely with the patient if that’s what they want in return. bless them.</review>< Pics>

This is the best clinic that I've ever been to! The doctor and nurses are super friendly, and they offer free transportation! They also express that they really care and make you feel at home. I would recommend this place to anyone! :)))<//review>

<Review>I am 29 weeks pregnant and 2 days. I stopped coming to this clinic because the assisted transportation provided by San Juda’s made me late to my scheduled appointment at the clinic. The nurses and doctor made me wait 3 and a half hours even though I had a scheduled appointment for the day. I brought it up to EVERYONE’S attention (nurses and doctor) yet EVERYONE said they couldn’t do anything but allow EVERYONE who was ahead of me to be seen. My appointment was scheduled for 10AM and I was seen until 12:30PM. Disgusting and rude! Not to mention anyone hardly speaks English so if you aren’t bilingual or speak fluent Spanish-you will be finding this clinic very difficult to get by. When I finally got to see the doctor she needed me to update her upon my file. She didn’t remember my ultrasound date, updates doctor visits I’ve provided, and my updated due date. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and ridiculous! ANY doctor should know about their own clients file and paperwork. Since then I’ve never returned and have been in between OBGYN’s due to their poor customer service. Sad ANYONE has to feel this way about a doctors office/clinic- especially while pregnant! I DON’T RECOMMEND YOU WASTE YOUR TIME HERE ALL DAY AND BOTHER BEING JUDGED. After not being able to pick up my breast pump due to poor communication skills AGAIN by a nurse here at this location, she updated me that every other nurse on-site spoke about my situation about me no longer wanting services due to wait time. What type of clinic, nurses, and doctors GOSSIP about their clients they’re receiving their pay from? Seriously, don’t come here please! You’d be doing yourself, family, friends, and most importantly your baby a favor! They only care about your money and insurance<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I tried to get my appointments at 8am (the time they open). I end up getting help like about 30-40 minutes later. I've notice the staff is always late. I think they need to fix this and learn how to multitask.  Staff are not well qualified to do this. They are always talking when they open in the morning when they should be worrying about getting things done.</text><time>1520010300890<//time><user_name>Galaxy_ 503< /user_name>< gmap_id>

Doctors,nurses are great . My PROBLEM is always with the transportaion department. The lady jessica has made me miss 3 appointments, almost 4,but no i made sure i was not goimg to miss anymlre because this lady wants to do what ever she wants. It would of been ok if those are clinic rules but no she just has attitude. Then you want to complain to someone else and either she says manager is not atound, or when the manager is around they both are the same. Jessica lies everytime making patients beleive we didnt amswer phones to miss appoimments saying they were outside and left. No never true , i always wait outside noone ever shows up. Talks to tranportation drivers veeeery rude . Clinic is great they do take a while but honestly transportation is baaaad<//review>

Terrible. My 3rd time today coming in this year to try to get my birth control. Rude front desk would rather gossip then welcome patients and designate to correct sign in sheet. They refuse to service me without a doctors permission although the doctor who helped me before mentioned there should be no problem. OPEN on fridays with NO DOCTOR..Never coming back.</text>

< Review>
Es una clínica que tiene empleados solo por tenerlos porque no son nada profesionales quisiera saber si al lugar donde fueron a estudiar les enseñan hacer arrogantes con los pacientes en esta semana les llame porque les dije que me iba a cambiar de clínica y que necesitaba mi expediente clínico cuando fui a la clínica a recogerlos la enfermera NORMA mientras le habla ella simplemente me ignoro y se puso hablar con otras enfermera y lo único que me dijo fue “wherever “ y que según tiene una “consejera” que durante los 8 meses que tengo de estar con ellos una tan sola vez me hicieron pasar con ella para que también me ignorara porque no sabía si estaba hablando conmigo o con alguien más ya que tenía el celular en las manos y mientras “me hablaba “ nunca me dio la mirada. Soy mamá primeriza y según que te deberían mucha información charlas cosas que nunca paso en esa clínica la verdad MUY MAL SERVICIO bueno creo que sería PÉSIMO SERVICIO que dan en esa clínica</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very bad but bad service I do not recommend it at all, nurses from the children's area heavy and bitter, I arrived for my appointment at 840 and they attended me at 2:30 because I was pressuring them because not even the children called me one of 3 and 5 years without eating, just because of all those people, I arrived 10 minutes late and that's why the reception nurses grabbed her with me because I told them why they didn't call me and she said that it was going to happen without an appointment and they never called me the nurse thought it affected me but it was not the children who waited until 3 to have lunch, terrible service

(Original)
Muy mal pero mal servicio no la recomiendo para nada, enfermeras del área de niños pesadas y amargadas, llegué a mi cita a las 8 40 y me han atendido a las 2 y media porque las estuve presionando porque ni tansiquiera me llamaron los niños uno de 3y 5 años sin comer, solo por culpa de todo ese personas, llegué 10 minutos tardes y por eso las enfermeras de recepción la agarraron conmigo porque les dije que porque no me llamaban y dijo que ya hiba a pasar como sin cita y nunca me llamaron la enfermera pensó que me afectaba a mi pero no eran a los niños que esperaron hasta las 3 para poder almorzar, pésimo servicio</text><rating>1</rating>< user_name>

I am worried about my health, and it only says that the results are normal and that they only have 10 minutes per patient !!! That shows that they are more interested in money, than the health of their patients! The attitude of the receptionists is the worst! Do not go here!

He saw me as nothing and left the office and I was crying because it hurt a lot. Three days after I went with him, I went to the general hospital emergency room and they found a strange tissue that was hurting me and I already had a severe infection that the doctor told me was an emergency. She told me that she did not understand how that doctor did not perform the biopsy if everything seemed to be ready. He told me to go back to demand the biopsy because it didn't look good. But I told him that I was afraid to return because it hurt me so much. And she referred me to specialists in the general hospital. They tried to communicate with him many times and they did not get it, they did all the exams again but they told me to go to the San Judas clinic, where they initially found me the abnormal exam, and when I went to get help they became the underserved, They treated me badly and did not want to give me my medical records, which by law correspond to me. I went three times and they only spoke to me with words of intimidation so that I would not continue asking for my files. In the end I told them that I would complain and just like that, just like that! They handed them to me. Two women locked me in a room and did not let my companion in and made me sign a paper as they were not responsible in case of a lawsuit !!! I had a concern for my health and they didn't help me but made me feel bad! In the end I tell them and I hope they see this. In the general hospital I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and had it not been because I went to the emergency room at this time the cancer would have advanced further! If I had stayed with the "come back in a year from the biopsy doctor" maybe they could not have done anything for me. Now I am still in recovery at the general hospital LAC + USC where they provided all the help very professionally. Many people tell me why not demand them? But right now my health comes first, and it would be very tedious to walk in these procedures. This place is not recommended.

No vayan a este lugar, por experiencia propia. Hace 10 meses fui a mi papanicolao, regrese por mis resultados y salieron a normales, a lo que ellas “las enfermeras” me refirieron con un “doctor” en otro lugar para una biopsia, ese doctor no hizo bien su trabajo, salí lastimada de ese lugar y solamente me dijo: “estás muy sensible, no puedo hacerte biopsia, regresa en un año a otro papanicolao.”! Me vio como nada y se salió del consultorio y yo me quede llorando porque me dolía mucho. A los 3 días de haber ido con el, fui a emergencias en el hospital general y encontraron un tejido extraño que me estaba lastimando y tenía ya una infección severa que la doctora se emergencias me dijo que era peligrosa. Ella misma me dijo que no entendía como ese doctor no me realizó la biopsia si todo se veía que ya estaba listo. Me dijo que regresara allá a exigir la biopsia porque no se veía bien. Pero le dije que tenía miedo de regresar porque me lastimó mucho. Y ella me refirió con especialistas en el hospital general. Ellos intentaron comunicarse con el muchas veces y no lo consiguieron, me hicieron de nuevo todos los exámenes pero me dijeron que fuera a la clínica San Judas, donde inicialmente me encontraron el examen anormal, y cuando fui a buscar ayuda ellos se hicieron los desentendidos, me trataron mal y no querian entregarme mis archivos médicos, que por ley me corresponden. Fui en tres ocasiones y ellos sólo me hablaban con palabras de intimidación para que yo no siguiera pidiendo mis archivos. Al final les dije que iría a quejarme y sólo asi, solo así! Me los entregaron. Me encerraron dos mujeres en un cuarto y no dejaron entrar a mi acompañante y me hicieron firmar un papel según que ellos no eran responsables en caso de una demanda!!! Yo tenía una preocupación por mi salud y ellas no me ayudaron sino que me hicieron sentir mal! Al final les digo y espero que ellos vean esto. En el hospital general fui diagnosticada con cancer cervical y de no haber sido porque fui a emergencias a esta hora el cancer ya hubiera avanzado más!!! Si yo me hubiera quedado con el “regresa en un año del doctor de la biopsia” quizás no hubieran podido hacer nada por mi. Ahora sigo en recuperación en el hospital general LAC+USC donde si me brindaron toda la ayuda muy profesionalmente. Mucha gente me dice que porque no los demande? Pero en estos momentos mi salud es lo primero,  y sería muy tedioso andar en esos trámites. Este lugar no es recomendable.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b8ad093836a3:0xb6fed1e02e5b7cf0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service they want to have exams that you are not asking for. I only went for a blood test, they robbed me $ 35 practically charged me for sitting and when the supposed doctor saw me it was not more than 5 minutes I was sent to the breath and I got the resepcionista with exam prices that I was not asking for. The resepcionista was very bad and nothing nice is believed to be the owner. Typical Latina is only a resepcionista and is already believed to be a DOCTOR

Muy mal servicio quieren haserte exámenes que no estás  pidiendo. Solo fui por un examen de sangre me robaron 35 dólares prácticamente me cobraron por estar sentado y cuando el supuesto doctor me vio no fueron más de 5 minutos me mando ala respcion y me sale la resepcionista con unos precios de exámenes que no estava pidiendo. La resepcionista fue muy pésima y nada de amable se cree que es la dueña. Típica latina solo es resepcionista y ya se cree que es DOCTORA< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service, if I continue to go to this clinic it is because my children are already older and it is because they have always been there, but the service provided by the nurses before was much better than the nurses in front are now lazy and inept.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio, si sigo iendo a esta clínica es porque mis hijos ya están mas grandes y es porque ahí han estado siempre, pero el servicio que daban las enfermeras de antes era mucho mejor que las enfermeras que están en frente ahora son unas flojas e ineptas.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Bad service. I don't know if they exploit them but they are angry. They are not organized. And doctors lsv. And between them, their mistakes are justified.
If you want to ask for proof for your worker. Here they will give it to you very late but they will give it and reluctantly. And parking is limited. And not everyone speaks Spanish. and let's confirm pregnancy. And we left at 4 o'clock and not even people

(Original)
Mal servicio. No se si las explotan pero andan enojadas. No estan organizados. Y doctoras lsv. Y entre ellas se justifican.sus errores disiendo ES RUTINA.
Si quieren pedir comprobante para su trabajador. Aqui se lo daran tardisimo pero se lo daran y de mala gana. Y el parqueo es limitado. Y no todos hablan español. e ivamos a confirmar embarazo. Y salimos a las 4 horas y ni personas abian<//text>

(Translated by Google) It is incredible that when it comes to children or babies, I can assist you with an apprentice, who does not know what to tell you. To my 1-month-old baby, I prescribe a cream that burns my face ... After two days I had to take it to the Hospital Emergency ... Be careful ... !!!

Es increible q cuando de niños o bebes se trata, te pueda atender con una aprendiz, q no sabe q decirte. A mi bb de 1 mes le receto una crema q le quemo la cara... A los dos dias tuve q llevarlo de Emergencia al Hospital...  Tengan cuidado....!!!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>A perfect spot to spend 30 or 40 min, either throwing your pet a ball or watching them play with other dogs. Large enough for running, yet small enough that you'll never lose site of your companion. Trees for shade, a bench and picnic table for seating.
And TWO shovels! What more could you want?<//review>< Pictures>

A nice but small dog park. An area for both small dogs and one for large dogs. No grass just dirt.</review>

<Date>1574732368939< /Date><rating>4< /rating><Text>Nice, long park (good for dogs that love to RUN), clean, nice people! Everyone was pretty responsible with their dogs, cleaning up after them and making sure they weren't getting too pushy or aggressive.

The ground is dirt (no grass or mulch) which means your dog might get dusty - nothing a little bath can't fix - and there's a picnic table to sit on. There's also a little water dispenser and bowl.

Also there's a pretty substantial slope on one side so it can be a bit of a challenge to get to (say, if you need to clean up after your dog) if you have mobility issues.

Just what we needed to run off some of his energy. It's not huge, but not bad for a neighborhood dog park!<//Text>< Pics>

Still mostly dirt, but noticed that there's a lot of tall trees providing good shade in the summer days.  Large enough for dogs that like to run.</review>< Pics>

Small dog side not very big and concrete instead of dirt. Double gated pass thru entry to both sides. Shovel and garbage can available for clean up.

Though smaller than other dog parks, this one is mostly on top of a burm, so it remains usable in rainy conditions. There is plenty of room to throw a ball but have good aim or it might go over the fence. The gravel surface keeps my dog free of mud. I like this park mostly for winter/wet occasions.< /review>

I'll start with the good things i like that they have two play areas for small and large dogs i have a puppy so it was nice for her to be able to play with other puppy/puppy sized dogs. what i didnt like is that the terrain is very rocky no grass and there's a steep slope one side that your dog could get hurt on.</review>

I like this dog park because it's not crowded.  It's like a hidden gem.  I used to take my dogs to Earl Warren, but there are just too many dogs.  Gets way too crowded....and too crazy.< /review>

Very clean. There are not many dogs there usually, if any. My dog does a lot of running at this park because it's long and narrow so he can do laps back and forth.< /Text>

Amazing food. Amazing tacos. Would love to see more hot sauce options but that's probably because I do take out and they have the bottles of a hot sauce for dine in<//Text>

My delivery would take 45 minutes (which is long already) turned into an hour and a half at that point I just canceled the order because that’s simply ridiculous...was not offered a discount or anything to help the situation either. (and they don’t know fluent English) meaning your order can get messed up very easily.< /Text>

This place has changed a lot. They put sliced imitation cheese on my omelette and the butter didn’t even melt on my toast and it was not hot.  The waiter seemed to have a problem with serving certain ethnic backgrounds. I am done with this place for good. 0 stars.</text>

I came in and I felt at home.
I've have the Barbacoa tacos and they were tasty.
The flavor of the meat was perfect!
I highly recommend this "hole in the wall"< /review>

Huge portions and very reasonable in price. I ordered the liver and onions to go, they got my order fairly quickly. Sadly my liver was very dry and the majority of it was burnt. I might be back to try something else, but not the liver and onions.</Text>

Great neighborhood restaurant. Good vegetarian options for lunch & dinner, and surprisingly they serve breakfast. Booth or counter seating. Good beer selection.</Review>

Overall:  good value for the price.  Plenty of parking.  Atmosphere was a small diner.  Bathrooms are tiny.  Quantity of food was pretty large and the taste was pretty good.  Had the green chili pork and a side taco.  The side taco could have been a meal in itself.</Review>

Hands down one of the best Mexican places I've been to in a while.  The staff is always awesome, and provide great service. The food is amazing, I go here just about once a week and try something new, and I still haven't found anything that was just great.<//review>

<Review>The food is good, I just have an issue with the older waitress that works in the morning. Very rude.  Every time I go in there, she just seems to be mad at someone and it reflects on her customer service.  She has a very bad attitude.  Very rude person!  I've also been there in the evening, waitress working that shift very friendly.  Very good customer service!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dd330a351063db:0xfc1d7cc3d90afd6e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a cozy, simple, no frills neighborhood spot for some comfort food. I stop here on occasion at the end of a work day,grab a beer and a few lengua tacos and it's tasty  served with excellent and friendly customer service. It's a low key place, so don't expect a fancy interior, but do expect some tasty food, a TV or two playing whatever game May be on, and the friendly staff that will take care of you. Reasonable in price and everything from the street tacos to the ceviche is worth a try.<//review>

< Review>
It was just OK. I expect Mexican food to be authentic and all home made when I go to a real Mexican restaurant. The chips came from a bag and were not very good. I got the works burrito with chicken and it was fine. I cant say it was good or bad, it did its job of filling my hunger. My husband got the works burrito with carne asada and he said it was really grisly. It's dated on the inside and needs a really good cleaning. The woman that served us said about 3 words to us, the service was slow. I would only come here again if it was the last Mexican place in Long Beach.< /Review>

8:10 am on a friday morning they are close when they're supposed to be open and there is a sign that says open. Its frustrating being hungry as hell.</review>

<Text>I have been dining here for over a year now.  The food is delicious and the service is always on-point.  The shrimp "street-style" tacos are amazing and very big with lots of ingredients.  The Shrimp enchiladas are also incredible - they will serve them with green sauce by request (recommended).  Carne Asada burritos (both wet & dry) are super tasty.  Molcajete was also very good with a TON of food in there.

In the evening, ask for Lupita & Lorena - extremely friendly and the best servers ever!!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Asada tacos are the best here :) Chips and salsa are free as much as you want. Must try the Carne Asada plate, yummylicious! Parking is limited so must park on street. Food is great but bathroom facilities could improve.<//Text>

I came to check out their breakfast. I ordered a glass of OJ and the waitress said that is going to be $3.75. It took me off guard and I blurted out - I can afford that. Their breakfast was okay - nothing special.<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The food is very good, the attention of Lupita the waitress is EXCELLENT ... but when she is not there the service is not good ... She is attentive to details ... Deplorable situation ... tables outside and inside with all the service dirty ... And close to the coffee makers and in full view of all ... Sorry for the observation ...

(Original)
La comida muy buena, la atención de Lupita la mesera es EXELENTE .. pero cuando ella no esta el servicio no esta bien ... Ella esta atenta a  los detalles ... Deplorable situación ... mesas afuera y adentro con todo el servicio sucio ... Y cerca a la cafeteras y a la vista de todos... Perdón por la observacion ...</Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The food is fine, but in postmates they mark the food as if it were ready and not yet, I recently asked for a molcajete order and canceled it in less than 5 seconds, they charged me 25.29 because it was already done !! Please that takes almost half an hour when I eat there. I will claim it to my bank as a fraud to receive my money back.

La comida bien ,pero en postmates marcan la comida como si estuviera lista y aún no está, hace poco pedí una orden de un molcajete y lo cancele en menos de 5 segundos ,me cobraron 25.29 porque ya estaba hecho!!

Most of the time the food is great there are a few items I won't eat but the original chicken and the whoppers are great the staff is nice most of the time but I guess everyone has a bad day. Good place to take kids and the prices aren't bad.</Review>

I waited in line for 45 minutes. I was stuck there. By the time I got my food I didn't want it anymore. Whoever the hiring manager is here please get them some help. It's just not right to leave one person running the place when the line is backed up almost out of the parking lot. They were very nice though. Just damn, almost an hour for some fries and I couldn't leave.<//text>

<Review>If your drive through is going to trap cars in line, train your employees to handle a rush. I have been in line for 30 mins and still there's 3 people in front of me. I could eat faster at a sit down restaurant. The car at the window hasnt gotten their order in at least 10 mins. Do you wait til we are at the window to start anything? What in the hell? Also, this is the 2nd time in a row i've wasted almost an hour in line.....for fast food.</Review></record>

Burger king on 2nd and Nord has horrible service and treats little kids very poorly. I would never suggest eating there. The food was burnt, bread and buns was old. No work ethics or integrity with the employees at this particular burger king. We visited 04/23/2021.<//Review>

<text>Best service experience I’ve had in a long time, noticed the service gets kinda slow tho when inside starts having to take orders along with doordash coming on their system at a constant. Makes it seem like the other bad reviews are just because people are spiteful and haven’t worked a day of fast food in their lives</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Ordered through the app. Got to the location, short line but was asked to wait at the speaker. After a long wait, told them in that I had mobile order and confirmed the name. Unusually long wait in line, get to window and they were out of the drinks we had ordered and one of the items. They offered alternatives, but it got to be too many changes. Wanted to just cancel. They had already charged me for the order and had no way to refund there order. If they could not figure the order and needed to substitute, they should have said so at the speaker where there was still a chance for me to leave rather than make me waste my time in that line. Not the first time I've had trouble, so I rarely try. The Chico locations seem to be understaffed and very poorly managed.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< rating>

If I could have put zero stars i would have. The staff is immature and disrespectful. Also can't do their job correctly, I got uncooked food once the second time my good was wrong, the third was wrong as well. So I went inside the establishment and went to get my money back and the people there took their time. The manager didn't even try taking care of the problem or show her face. And when I did get my money back the girl that was working the drive through had the audacity to say "I hope it was worth it" like the reason they messed up was my fault. When she couldn't take my order correctly the first time.< /Text>

Ah this place isn't half bad I like how close it is and I've suprisingly haven't had too much trouble as far as wait times at the drive through are and since this year's been rough on business I can understand why the drive through is slower. Staff weren't always the friendliest but no biggie. I remember watching tv their a few times that was nice.< /text>

<text>Cheap, vegan fast food! More than just fries, there's the impossible Whopper which is decent burger and French toast sticks. That's all I've tried so far, but it's nice to have a cheap fast food option for vegans. You can look up online to see all of Burger King's vegan options. There's a lot of good vegan options downtown and around Chico State campus, but if you're really short on time and money, I recommend Burger King, it gets the job done.<//text>< Pictures>

This Burger King on Second St. In Chico is the slowest store I have ever been to. There where 3 cars ahead of me and it took 20 minutes to finally order. Then I pulled up to the pick up window and it took an additional 8 minutes to get my whopper and fries. When I checked my order my fries where half empty. There where 7-8 two inch fries 🍟 in the medium cardboard container they come in. I will never go back to this Burger King again. I should have went to Carl’s Juniors . In fact they will get my business from now on.</review>

I’d fire whoever caused this. Saw at least 7 separate cars drive away. The guy in front of us ordered 4 tacos. He was there for at least 30 of those minutes. For 4 tacos... embarrassing BK.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

It took 15 minutes before anyone asked to take my order through drive thru, then it took another 25 minutes to get our food. Then I checked our food before leaving and they missed the fries for our meals, forgot to put the bacon on two burgers which took another 10 minutes for them to fix. It was absolutely ridiculous, this was my first and last time going to this burger king location. I recommend everyone not to go this Burger King; unless you have all the time in the world to wait, like bad service and missed items and incorrectly made.</Review>

I had to get a refund after waiting a half hour and there was still a half dozen orders to go out before mine. It was not a rush, they only had one cashier who was running front counter and drive through and one gal who was on grill and complaining about being confused and wanting to close early and the manager was in the office until his friend showed up and he went outside for a break while there were the same 5 or so orders waiting from the time I got there to when I finally got a refund and left 30 mins later.</Text>

< Review>
Today the BK was suppose to be open at 6am, I arrived at 7am and was not open. The lady was rude and told me that I had to wait til 7:30am. This was very inconvenient. Sorry to say I will not be coming here any more.< /Review>

I placed an order online for pickup. When I went to go pick it up, the lobby doors were locked. So I called asking if someone could bring my order out to me if I couldn't go in. Mind you this was around 3pm on a sunday. The lady on the phone told me they were closed due to being understaffed. But I had already paid for my orde . She then told me to call back in about half an hour and hopefully they'll have enough staff to make my orde . I called back about 45 minutes later and no answer. An hour later, no answer. Very disappointed and haven't received a refund.<//Text>

I only went here because i have no food (literally, college life) and because i got a coupon in the mail. They didn’t acknowledge the line starting to form with what four or five people working no one ever talked to us until 5-8 mins of already being in line. It seemed like one guy in front was working hard to get out orders and was very respectful so you couldn't really be too mad. Also gave us free sauces and the order was out fairly quickly. Hot food and everything i ordered was what i would expect from burger king quality.</text>

God I hate this place. The drive thru takes forever, most of the staff seem like they hate life and hate working there, they have messed up my order so many times, and the food is mediocre at best. The only reason I keep going is because my husband loves their burgers.<//text>

Had an Impossible Whopper.
Am a recovering meat eater/ vegetarian. Burger King was my favorite fast food burger when I ate less mindfully.
Impossible doesn't taste like the real thing and there's lots of gas the next day.</Review>

Both employees at the window had huge attitudes before we even had a chance to say anything, super rude and unprofessional. on top of it they gave me the wrong drink I asked for sprite and was given a coke, the fries were gross tasted like they weren’t cooked all the way through. My whopper was also wrapped in an “impossible burger”wrapper which made me think they had given me a plant based burger instead of a normal beef one like I asked for.</Review>

<review>Just about every morning for the past two weeks I have came here for a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit and a small order of hash browns, and with the exception of one time (this was with a manager making the order after complaining) the sausage is always old and dry and the hash browns are always cold, greasy and super salty.. even when requesting a fresh order I still get cold and old.. I think from now on I'll go to jack in the box down the street.<//review><time>1565711534912<//time>< Resp>

I like their variety more than McDonald's and their prices aren't bad.

They drastically need to improve wait time. I've only been to one Burger King that didn't make me wait, even when I'm the only customer.  They only ever have a skeleton crew: one cook, one cashier, one manager.  And one of them always seems like they're new.

I would prefer them over McDonald's if they could improve this one thing, but it's been this way for years now.<//review>

<review>Wait in drive thru was 17 minutes, quickest its ever been. Garbage visibly on floor from pull up window. Quiet comparable to Burger King on skyway across town.  Only rated 1 star because none is not an option.< /review><gmapID>0x808327af2586c4bd:0x7d52d6ec742ab0e</gmapID>< resp>

Friendly, colorful staff. Generally quick and accurate, occasionally bogged down during the evening rush. I appreciate their choice of TV programming in the dining area- documentaries, Nat Geo, ect.<//text>

No one to get my order for awhile. Told me the wrong number for my order. Gave my order to go when I asked for dine in. Didn't have bbq sauce. Order ended up being correct after the wait.< /Review>

It's really not great. Very slow, even with only two cars in the drive thru. They'll get your food for you, but often is cold or something is missing. They'll fulfill your order correctly sometimes though, so, 2 stars.</review>

My experience,  I thought I would stop at Burger King and get some lunch. But needed to use the restroom right away. ( if you catch my drift). When asked for access to restroom I was told to get into a long line and order food first . I explained that I really needed to use the restroom right away that I couldn’t wait to stand in line and order my food but I would do so afterwards. I was then rudely denied access to restroom . So after some hopping skipping and jumping around in that line ordering some food. I was still told to wait to use the restroom. Show some compassion Burger King.<//review>

<Text>I have tried time and time again to eat at BK and it has never been good. When did they hit rock bottom? BK, no one wants mayo to gush into their mouth, like a cream filled donut, when eating one of your burgers. That was the worse experience I have ever had ever. I opened my burger to find a mountain of mayo. Why? That said, the service members seemed annoyed having to be there at work and your landscaping is awful. That is all on top of your restaurants always looking beat down. I'm not sure I will ever go back to a BK again.</Text>< date>

<Text>Worst BK in Chico. I am forced to come here because of the location. There has not been one time where they did not mess up my order or the food was cold or you wait 20 minutes in the drive thru. The manager screamed at me in front of my child when asking for a remake.<//Text></record>

Went to drive thru, was told on the speaker that they couldn't take orders in the drive through, but I was welcome to come inside....however, also be aware that we are not selling any burgers or grilled items. Wow.</review>

Horrible customer service, flirting with my girlfriend in front of me. Employees talking loudly as guests were in dining room, about hooking up with female counterparts. Wait time was laggish and distracted. Chicken patties were raw in the midles oil tasted old. Got seriously sick. Would not recommend< /Text>

You know... i don't normally ever give this low a rating... but i have been a little disappointed with this place. Once had raw chicken nuggets, which were thankfully replaced, and on multiple other occasions there have been expenses that i was not made aware of before hand. Also, for the quality, some of it seems overprice, so for the time being i do not plan on going back there.< /review>

Service was bad. Took to damn long, and the lobby was empty along side of the drive through so I don't know what took so long, And worst of all....they messed up on my meal twice and gave me an attitude like I'm giving them a hard time.... Need a new manager or crew or something.... Very disappointing.</Text>

This is the 1st time in over 2 decades that I finally am happy with having to go to the dentist, I love Dr Chopra, he was so good at making sure I felt no pain and I appreciated that he also was focused on saving my teeth instead of pulling them, like so many of my ‘past dentists’..
I am very grateful! I also want to say he has a Great Assistant Angie!
And as a matter of fact the whole office staff is Great!
Thanks Liz, Mayra and Sandra
I love my Western Dental @ 5200 Stockton Blvd. Sacramento CA!< /Review>

<text>Thank you so much to Hilda and Leslie! Hilda was amazing at explaining everything as she did the cleaning and made me feel super comfortable as she explained what she was doing with the tools as she was cleaning. They both were very kind and super quick! The staff was very friendly and provided me with A LOT of information. If you do stop by at this dentistry ask for Hilda she will take good care of you!< /text>< pictures>

<review>Absolutely love the service at  Dental.  They have the best staff!   Ms. Ebony took care of all my questions and concerns from the minute I walked in.  I was super nervous because I hate having dental work done.  But after meeting with Ms. Ebony, I felt more at ease and comfortable with taking the next steps.  Ms. Ebony is great at what she does, it’s a tough job to get me to sit still in a dentist office.  If you have any questions or fears, ask for Ebony!!!  I appreciate the great hospitality.  Overall, customer experience was excellent!   Not to mention, the prices and payment plans are super reasonable.   Thank you so much Brident team!  You are appreciated!!!< /review>< pics>

I came to Western Dental today for a dental emergency in a lot of pain. I'm a single mom of 5 so I haven't made time to take care of my own teeth for several years....Jeremiah took care of my X-rays. He was very friendly and made sure I was comfortable. Leslie was awesome helping me with finance options so I was able to get the treatment I needed. Dr. Marshall was amazing! She made the experience comfortable & had a fun sense of humor. Thea the dental assistant was so kind and professional. No one likes going to the dentist, but these wonderful people made my experience a very good one!!!! Thank you all!!!! 😊💗< /Review>

I've had two visits so far for dental work and it's the first time in my life that I had such a pain-free experience like this. Dr. Arora is a very skilled professional. I feel that I am in good hands being treated by her. And she explains everything she is doing and puts it in simple terms. I really appreciate being able to get her as my new dentist.<//Review>

I was at Western Dental in Poway today with my husband and son. My visit was professional and enjoyable especially since going to the dentist is not a favorite thing.  I would like to give a special thank you for Erica G. for her great work with me. She made sure I was never nervous. Overall the appointments went very well.

Thank you.

<text>I came in today for a quick oral exam and Jeremiah was the dental assistant that helped me out today. He was so friendly and calm during the whole process which made me feel at ease with everything. He conducted X-rays today and he made sure I wasn’t experiencing any discomfort during the process which I appreciate. He explained what he was doing as he was doing it and made this appointment very smooth and easy for me.<//text>< Pics>

I'm not a fan of the dentist but Shiva and the good doctor at the Corona office took good care of me today. Made me feel comfortable,  and with minimal pain. I can't wait to get back to get the rest of this work done. If I had folks like this from the beginning I would have never felt embarrassed and ashamed to go see them resulting in less work and less money needed.  All my fault, but with these people and the comfortable setting they provided ill be back when I'm supposed to. Never felt this comfortable with any dental provider!< /Text>

I am glad to report my Western Dental experience at 2901 E. Broadway in Tucson, Az.was a good one.  All the staff and people at Western Dental were courteous, professional and helpful.  I want to particularly acknowledge my dentist, Dr. Sloan.  He pulled two teeth and made a lower denture for me and also relined my upper denture and lower denture.  Dr. Sloan was considerate and very good in all his work.  So I am very appreciative and thankful for Western Dental and their people.  BY Gerald Erikson on March 17,2021.</review>

<Text>First of all, kudos to Tech Chris Wilson who took my X RAYS. I'm not a great patient when it comes to that, but Chris was very patient with me and made it a tolerable experience.  Chris also assisted with my tooth extraction (I believe his first one ) and did a wonderful job. The staff is very friendly. The only thing I had a problem with was scheduling me for a 9 o'clock appointment when they open at nine. I had to wait awhile to get on to see anyone. Seems to me they should open earlier to get patients in near the time of their appointment. Other than that, no concerns.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1615833883337, 'text': "This is great news!

They are very nice here ! My first time in I was nervous and embarrassed but the lady made me feel very comfortable. She assured me that I had nothing to worry about or to be embarrassed about and that made me feel better! The receptionist is also very helpful, she worked with me to find the right payment plan which helped a lot.
They also follow all procedures that the pandemic has brought, that also makes me feel safe!</text>

The place is super clean and staff are very organized.
Dc.Shinali is super professional and caring.
I have been into other clinics and received care from other doctors. Dr.Shinali REALLY knows what she is doing! she is good at explaining things to her patients and she fixed my teeth problems! I am super glad with the service at Western Dental /Chicago Ave branch and I absolutely recommend it .</text>

I had a visit with Brident Dental where there appeared to be a misunderstanding on my services to  be rendered...the situation  at the time became very frustrating and upsetting but after calmly speaking with Josephine and listening to her explain the situation things became  clearer .. Dr T. Patel (female) also interacted in the situation at hand  it was confusing  at first but she went high and beyond on getting the situation solved...she had patience...she did not try to blow you off and her explanation was through as well as her assistant Josephine...just wanted to say to Brident Dental that you have to GREAT members on your dental team 😉 Hats off to Dr Patel and Josephine...We need more Dr like Dr T Patel !!</Text>

There are real people who work at Western Dental and as such people have good days and bad days.  That said, my experiences with Western Dental have been mostly positive with only one negative attitude from an employee whom I dont have any more interactions with. I am very satisfied with the care my local Western Dental professionals have given me. I will go back in two weeks to pick up my upper and lower partials. It's been a long road but worth it.</Review>

My grandchild was being bullied because of her smile. Although, she lives in Chicago, I got her braces at WD in downtown Oakland.  I was laid off but got her bill current to resume treatment. Without a text, phone call etc., her appointment was cancelled-after flight and hotel accomodations were made! When she did come in I was scolded and told she would be kicked out of their system if she ever missed an appointment. (Even though I keep her bills paid). Due to a possible Covid exposure I had to reschedule her upcoming appointment. The staff member was so nasty on the phone just because she could be. There has never been any black customer service reps at the front desk even though there waiting room is always filled with black people. To have contempt for the people who pay your bills requires management to reconsider who represents the company.<//review>

<name>PT Curtiss<//name><Text>Keith, my 69 year old hygienist today, delivered the most thorough and efficient cleaning I've had in years!

I'm aware I accumulate plaque between cleanings, but I'll bet the past 6 cleanings were not as "thorough" nor as informative.

I admit I do not brush my teeth daily and especially not twice per day! I do Floss, but only when I brush and usually after I brush; which Keith told me to do before brushing.

Keith's instructions for using my Oral-B was the best I've heard (I probably didn't read the instructions).

I hope that my next cleaning is with this professional.

Go Dr Jillian and Catherine. Best doctor ever, made me feel so comfortable and she explained to me a detailed step by step so I would know what was happening. They follow COVID safety well too!
Corporate on the other hand is overbooking and making the wait times be 2 hours from your appointment time.</Text>

Horrible corporate office customer service. Not helpful at all. I have not received a bill in the mail since January. Can't even get a statement emailed. Calling doesn't help or resolve the issue. All they keep saying is we can put in a request. They don't let you speak to a supervisor or give you contact information. Do not use this company. Sucks for the office cause they are great.< /Review>

abusive and lying staff. not only did the commit insurance fraud and purposefully mess up my teeth for more money, the lady i spoke to DUG HER NAILS into my skin when i asked got a refund. i don’t even understand how this place still operates but they clearly only hire terrible and disgusting people who seek to abuse patients. this place has so many lawsuits for fraud and lying to patients yet they’re still standing. evil place. go elsewhere!!</Text>

I have had  total extraction of my teeth and am extremely disappointed in the service I have received from WD. The staff give you a cherry hello,  but contrary to the service. I had problems getting pain meds and insisted to immediately wear denials 24 hrs. seven days before gums heal right after extractions that are extremely painful.
The pharmacist even called and was transferred to 5 different offices to get help for me and still could not get help for me in getting pain meds.
The front desk clerk was playing doctor and the dental assistant. They refused to help me get med.
In addition, we keep being asked to get apply for credit check for $30,000 to get work done.  We, my daughter and I understand the packing of cells to help support our gums, but we just don't have the money.
I was given a prescription for medication I'm allergic to and will run up my blood pressure, and heart attack patient. I am a diabetic with several other health issues.
Even when the girl decided to charge us $15, 000 +.
My insurance has a limited income for me to have.
The teeth are horrible and rough.  To they don't fit. They didn't fit the day of extraction.  They hurt.
This is such a disaster and somebody needs to stop this craziness.
We have been going to Western Dental for a bit, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Rating>4</Rating><name>J AA< /name><review>I have gone to several otrho places for consults for braces for my son. My friend referred me to this dental office and I am very pleased with the service. The office staff is so friendly and the ortho doctor is very knowledgeable and was so kind to my son. So glad we're at Western Dental Corona office.

The only reason for the 4 stars is I'm going to wait to see what our visits will be like in terms of wait time for the ortho. Hoping they are on schedule with appointments as many in the Eastvale area, the wait is usually 30 to 40 mins after you check in for your appt at a certain time.< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>Wonderful professional people that take their time and make you feel Important. Wonder dr. B, she takes her time and very gentle and make sure she does the best work she could do for you. And Jeff was as wonderful making sure sure all of your paperwork was sent out professionally. I feel I had the best consultation and thorough examination.

The worst company to every  handle business. The customer service representatives are very rude and will not allow you to speak with a supervisor. I have requested numerous times a paid in full letter and I have gotten several excuses and lies. I had the same issues getting monthly statements. Mr. Daniel the CEO should have his staff retrained on etiquette, professionalism, and accuracy. I will make sure to informed my family and friends to never use this service.<//review>

< review>
The absolute WORST run organization I have EVER encountered. I went to this business because I was in pain and I could get an appt. quickly, now I know why. I needed a root canal ,per Western Dental, they told me they will have someone there that can do in A MONTH, and also he is not board certified, or I could get a referral to a specialist so I could get it taken care of sooner. I went that option. Well, the joke is on me. They did not send the referral. I waited 2 weeks then finally called. The office either doesn't answer the phone, or puts you on hold for 30min or more , then says (this happened a few times) you need to wait for corporate to respond. I have called corporate and emailed corporate several times this week. Corporate routes me back to this horrible office and the office offers no help.
THIS IS MADNESS!
AVOID THIS BUSINESS AT ALL COST!</review>

Worst customer service ever. Paid my contract balance in full and they were still charging me monthly, called numerous of times to explain to them and ask them why am I still being charged when I paid my contract balance in full and all I got was attitude and one of them hanging up on me. Instead of wanting to help, all of the employees I’ve spoke to over the phone seemed very annoyed and not understanding at all. I even emailed customer service 2 weeks ago and yet I have not received a single reply back. Last employee I spoke to over the phone gave me an attitude and told me to ignore my billing payments that came in the mail and that everything was good now and that my contract balance should show $0 now and just hung up on me. They should be able to send me my receipt showing my contract balance paid in full, but yet the only thing I have been receiving in the mail is more western dental billing payment that I shouldn’t be getting because I paid my contract in full already. Seems like this issue is not being resolved or taken seriously at all.

update: 8/3/20 called the billing office and spoke to a lady and she was kind and understanding and said my issue has been resolved and that my discount has been applied to my account and that my contract has been closed because it was paid in full and that my contract balance is now showing $0, finally, all this stress, lets just hope I will be getting my paid in full letter and the statement showing my contract balance of $0 in the mail soon because I did not get it in my email when she said she emailed it to me as well.</Text>

<Review>I started my dental cleanings after I moved to California . I chose western dental primarily because they were close to my home.
Since I began i have seen 4 different dentists no explanation given. In January I needed a tooth removed and was given a contract for a implant. I paid the uninsured balance on the spot. Thinking that was it. After my wait period for the graft to heal I scheduled an appointment to have the rest of the procedure done. When I arrived no one seemed to know what was i there for they had my scheduled appointment as an emergency check in. Oh and another new dentist. After I was seen by the new dentist.  I was presented with a new contract for impression and crown. My original contract apparently did not include this hum
So I compare this to a contractor installing a set of cabinets then coming back a saying oh my estimate did not include doors or drawers .
When I first asked about my contract before I signed it I was told it was for the entire treatment for this one tooth.
Iam absolutely disgusted with the lack of concern for patients and ther inability to know what is going on with each individual.
The wait times are 1hr to 1.5 hrs after scheduled appointment just to see the dentist not very efficient.
I don't usually post bad comments but felt compelled to do so.
I don't have anything bad to say about the staff as they do there best. I believe that corporate policy is to blame . A contract should include all items necessary from start to finish.
Very disappointed client<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Western Dental Palmdale CA office is a new nightmare.
First they ask you to sign about things never discussed or papers never given
Second Had some teeth pulled, had pieces of teeth coming out for months, so my gums weren’t healing. Dentist didn’t extract teeth correctly
Was fitting for partial dentures, which were of such poor quality, after months of readjustments, was told they couldn’t adjust anymore because they would break. Every time they tried to put in upper ones I nearly cried with pain. They just weren’t right. I refused to pay for something I couldn’t use.
Only option was implants, which are costing me a fortune to pay for
I’ve been without teeth for over a year and this office could care less about me as a patient
Do Not Use Western Dental. Seriously Do Not
I have given three complaints to corporate and nit one single follow up , not one.

<username>Monica Hernandez</username><text>western dental has been the worst experience I have ever had. They are not organized, no one knows what they are doing and are not friendly to help you.  I set up auto pay with one rep and the next month all of a sudden I was not set up, when I called the rep he was quick to tell me how I plan to make this payment. Instead of asking me how he can help me! My kid was at the ortho for the appointment and was not going to be seen until this was done.
Previously, when switching offices because we moved counties, they made it completely impossible to transition smoothly. It was phone call after phone call, I think it took about 3 months to finally get settled, but the whole time they were taking payments on auto-pay, but yet they were sending us PAST DUE notices and trying to charge us late fees. I can't and will never recommend western dental!!< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

Apparently they get money for upsell rather then doing what is best for a patient ..let alone one in severe pain.  I'd suggest you NOT go here.  Dentist tells you one story.. oral surgeon another story.  Finance gal another.  This is NOT A DENTAL OFFICE LOOKING AFTER THE BEST INTERESTS OF A PATIENT.</Review>

Even when i asked twice to speak with the Office Manager in a different room, instead of standing in front of other customers while we disagreed, she said nothing but, "I am trying to help you". Never the less, we were not seen for my grandsons braces adjustment. This was on a Saturday. I called after we returnd home, left a message for a Office Manger to call me to talk about this and here it is Monday almost noon and no phone call. Very disapointing.<//review>< pics>

I am updating my experience this was not a fun experience in the office. Somone asked me to do a comment here so I could get a free whitening kit. This is how they get you to comment.
Then I received no kit and was waiting on a call from office staff for 3 days.
Never received a call and ended up going to my old dentist office and had treatment done there instead.
I won't be  recommending this place in the future.
The doctor at western dental was nice but my treatment was way different than what was recommended by this doctor.<//review>

< Review>
Worst place ever. No contact for leadership team. Corp office cust serv cant give you balance of bill and or send you one bcuz they claim they virus is keeping them from sending bills. Craziest thing I have ever heard. Finance dept claims they are not western dental so they dont have business license# for you to report their ethics to state board or Calif dental board but the phone was answered  as western dental. Cant see patients due to virus, understandable, but can call everyday about your bill. These people put braces on my grandaughter in Feb and contracted to see her every month. It's been 4 months and eventhough they are closed due to virus, no one has called to even check to see if her teeth have shifted, if wires were broke or loose or anything. Noticeably the virus is not keeping them from calling about the monthly pmt..I feel her bill should be adjusted every month she is unable to get treatment. These ppl are money hungry. They allowed my grandaughter to sign a 4000 bill, 3 weeks after she turned 18, still in high school, with a 6-10  hour a week part time job. Now that's what you call taking advantage of a high schooler. Instead of checking first to see if she had a qualified income to pay this bill, they just ran her credit and  yes her credit was clear  she just turned 18. Western dental is now her first creditor and going to be her first lesson on what it's like to be 18..thanks Western dental! Now that she is off work bcuz of the virus and cant pay the bill they dont understand but we are suppose to understand they have not treated her in four months due to the virus. I feel there is something really shaky here as you cannot speak to anyone above the lowest employee there, customer service. They even have them filling out your complaints. I see all these ppl joining the leadership team but why are they not accessible to people who are paying 4000 bills that need to file complaints. The bad reviews are outrageous for a dental office. I read they are not bbb accredited so maybe they feel complaints wont go anywhere but I know how I'm getting ready to handle my virus time off. Wish me good luck! Also noticed here, they only answer to positive post and I'm just wondering what city these positive post came from because there are over 500 bad complaints on a different site in los angeles< /Review>

My last 4 appointments involve Dr. Jhala along with her assistant, Victor. Both are friendly, comforting and reassuring regarding the final adjustments and placement of my dentures.

When ever I have any problem or question, they bend over backwards to correct the issue and answers my questions in detail.<//Text>

<Text>Hello My name:
Andrea Herrera,
I had a really good experience with Dr. Wu, at 1407 W. March Lane Stockton Ca. 95207.

My experience I got my X-ray, done also my two fillings, done in the front...Dr. Wu, was very professional he was patient, gentle, but most importantly...

Dr. Wu, made time also for my deep cleaning, with his helpful assistance.

Dr. Wu, assistant Ingria, was very nice and professional I felt comfortable.

Sincerely,

Patient: Andrea Herrera</Text>< rating>

Have Medical, called and scheduled a simple teeth cleaning. Again, low income. I was told that the Dr. may or may not clean my teeth, and that I needed an examination.  When they finished with the examination, they said I needed beyond a cleaning, and they handed me a bill for 4,700.  what the hell happened to me just getting what I could afford? I simply asked for a regular teeth cleaning.< /text>

<Text>Western Dental is an overbooked, understaffed, poorly ran company from the dentist to the corporate offices. They will screw up your payments and attempt to pressure you into paying exorbitant fantasy late fees while with holding services. No one will return your phone calls and half the people are unqualified to work in the dental office. Secretaries prepping for dentist without washing their hands or wearing gloves. This is my 7th or 8th call to correct their screw ups!</Text><GmapID>0x80dcd9cf94ada39d:0xf3893975db941c22<//GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>104724794545314743178</userid>< Rating>

<review>Absolutely unprofessional, went in to have my wisdom teeth extracted, they over charged me $1100, had a meeting with my insurance brokers from work last week, spoke about what Western Dental charged me. My brokers reviewed my medical documents and found that they did indeed owe me, they used back office tactics to get me to agree to a 24 month plan, after my insurance reps contacted them, they informed the reps  they callwould call me immediately and credit me, but still have not called..
Wish I could give them no stars.< /review>< rate>

<time>1559195204533</time><rating>1</rating><Review>I'm only giving a one-star review because it's the lowest Google's got!

Currently, I have braces on that were applied by Western Dental. They'd sent me a letter in the mail informing me that they are choosing to no longer do business with me and they were terminating my contract with them. In the letter, it also stated that they were willing to take my braces off and would give me a retainer all for free, because if I kept them on, there was a high possibility that I would get cavities that would not be able to be taken care of until the braces are off.

Well, here is where my issue comes in. I'd called to schedule an appointment with them to have this taken care of. They'd informed me that I would need to pay $200 out of pocket to take them off. I'd mentioned the letter they sent me, but even with the letter, they'd refused to do the service for free as stated. I didn't end up making the appointment, because I didn't have $200 to just give away. So, by that point I was just willing to let it go. Unfortunately, now I've got several cavities beneath my braces that need to be taken care of.

I'd called an attorney, because I knew that them not taking me in initially, unless I agreed to pay that fee, was wrong. When I contacted my attorney, she told me to get a copy of the letter (I've yet to find my original). So, I called the corporate office and a woman named Sylvia was very snooty with me when speaking to her. I'd informed her that I would like a copy of the letter that was sent to me. She told me, "We are not obligated to resend the letter to you. Those letters are just a courtesy from us." I'd then asked to speak with a manager, but she refused and told me that she was the only one that was going to help me, and that if I wanted to have my lawyer contact them, she would have them transferred over to the legal department. She then hung up on me. I called back immediately (very angry at this point for what I'd experienced thus far) and a man answered this time. Once he heard who I was, he then hung up on me also. I called back a third time and Sylvia answered my call. I'd asked why she hung up on me, and she apologized and continued to yell and talk over me. I told her that she was being very unprofessional and giving me terrible customer service. She responded with, "This isn't the customer service department."

By that time I'd reminded her that my calls are recorded.

Now that I'm thinking about it, this is actually the same woman who gave me complications while I was pregnant with my son.

I knew that I wasn't going to get anywhere with her, and she wasn't going to let me speak with anyone else.

I submitted a complaint with the Dental Board for client negligence.

I'll need to call back to report Sylvia for the way she treated me as well as the other gentleman who hung up on me.<//Review>< pics>

>>EXTRA Zero star<< this place is totally scam, I will definitely sue this company. Hopefully we get ride of Western dental near soon because no one there is professional at all, they don't  care about your situation, they nicely respond to your reviews asking you to call them ! But, whenever you call customer service there is a rude lady who called Silvia doesn't care about your complain, she doesn't have any manners or sense of humor. Don't make a mistake and trust those scammers. All they care is to charge you as high as they possibly can.< /text>

Nothing is transparent, they rush you into braces/ any type of work, extremely unprofessional and if you're not on top of your finances/mouth they will do whatever to get you to stay in the contract even longer.

The corporate office gives you the run around, promises to call and will not return your calls and several time I have had employees in the corporate office hang up on me and laugh while I am explaining my issue.</Text>< pictures>

Just have to say many kudos to Shairoz who assisted Dr Gao with my son's root canal today 9/18/19 she is the most helpful and I was so impressed how she could work to help us and lots of other patients while it was a very busy day. I was well impressed by how she can handle such a busy environment and I am thankful for her because I knew she was to be off soon but she stayed to help out and put the customers first which is awesome of her Thank You< /Review>

The excuse was that one out of 2 x-ray machines was broken, the specialist who visits once a month was there and those patients had priority over a new elderly patient. Although we arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled, specialty patients took priority even 2 hours after our arrival. Lousy, unprofessional service.

<text>Dentist are not well enough trained . Looked at compliance element's.  Out of date signage posted indicating Dentist credentials.  Qualified dentist could not even give me the name of the metal they use for braces. Which I knew it is stainless steal.  On the form a parent fills out , there is no information regarding to the materials the use in the child's mouth while conducting the oral operations. Dr did not look over health history of patient. And still wanted to proceed moving forward with an operation that could of been very harmful to the patient or even fatal.
Classics and factorial case of malpractice.

I would like a response on what material this company uses when applying  braces in a patient's mouth.  What brand of metal this company supplies for braces and the origin from where it is made.

Even if this company choses not to give out this information,  a well composed discovery  team will deep dive and dig up any documents rrequires.
Dr did not even know about dental compliance required by the state along with federal guidelines.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I’ve been a customer since a little girl, (for 8 years). I put in a grievance with them because they were making me travel two hours just to get my retainers, and wouldn’t let me transfer to the one 3mins from my home, they made my retainers wrong, so when I came back to get them, they didn’t fit. My teeth were spacing out even more because I had to wait another two weeks. They basically said it was my fault and they wouldn’t provide the service to fix this problem without me basically paying for braces a 3rd time with them. I’m disgusted and am done with this company, I’m 24 but I’m going to get veneers instead. They don’t care about the customers and their corporate office is just as horrible as the service in the office. Save yourself the money and headache, after 8 years and about $10,000 of my own money, my teeth are reverting back once again. Absolutely horrible.</review>< name>

< review>
I went to Western Dental for braces because I thought it would be cheaper but it wasn't even worth it. They told me at my consultation that I wouldn't have to pay any kind of interest with a $0 down payment and they also told me I didn't have to pull any additional teeth out to receive braces. Well I ended up paying a $250 down payment. After they placed the brackets in (without wire or spacers) the lady said I had to pull 4 of my teeth in addition to the wisdom teeth I already had taken out. I told them I didn't want to get extra teeth taken out so I told them to cancel my contract. Then they told he I owed $1700 just for placing brackets on. They didn't even place a wire or spacers yet just little metal brackets. So now I'm looking into a lawyer because I shouldn't have to pay $1700 for that little bit of metal. Now I'm looking into getting a lawyer. They were so unprofessional. They should have told me before they placed bracket on my teeth or I wouldn't have gotten the braces in the first place.<//review>

I did my invisalign here and after couple years and getting 3 sets in their irvine office I received an awful result with lots of headache each time I go there!!
This location used to be smile wide when I initially bought my package and they keep changing my dr and later they change the name to Western Dental and again keep changing my doctor.
Their doctors are unprofessional and careless, the only thing they care is money with poor service!
I paid approximately $6k for invisalign. After 3sets with this awful result they are saying oh you shouldn’t do invisalign and since you are not happy you can pay more and do orthodontic (its because their office is stop doing invisalign and they dont want to get responsibility of my result) which is absolutely rude.

I called them several times and they have never called me back. I also called to their cooperation office and talked with Cidney three weeks ago. She was super rude and hangs up phone on me, so I called back and their supervisor told me she will follow up with irvine office and asked their manager to call me which Ive never get a called back!!!

This is not the first time that I am being treated badly and keep giving letter to sign in case they dont get sue. After they got the total payment they started treating me a badly...

If I could them 0 I would definitely give them 0.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>UPDATE TO MY REVIEW> WESTERN DENTAL IS BEING SUED and has "settled" out of court. YOU LOST, YOU ARE CRIMINALS. I have contacted the attorney general regarding Western Dental's criminal actions including harrassment, fraud (personal financial and insurance) and violation of the telephone consumers protection act.  I have involved the california dental board and the attorney generals office. Please contact me if you have been criminally violated by western dental within the past 2 years.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Then I was told the dentist that was working on me no longer worked there. I was also rescheduled 7 separate times. Finally I called to stop payment and cancel contract. I was told I would be contacted in 30 days. The office that worked on me didn’t even have their records right about what to charge me. The whole job was suppose to be 1800 and they only completed half. The girl in charge of accounts had the nerve to say I still owed money after paying 1100 dollars. Now I just received a statement for plastic due on something that hasn’t happened. I hat this company. Everyone on the phones are a joke. They are a big rip off!!!

<text>My husband has had 3 appointment that the office has cancelled. All 3 times they called the old phone number although they have been told at least 5 times what number to call.
I paid for all of his work before they started anything and now he has temperate crowns in for 3 months. He had an appointment for  tomorrow but now again the Dr is not going to be there. So what is this they take my money but won't do the work. Are they going to pay for the 3 days my husband  has missed  work.<//text>< Name>

I've never had such a bad experience worth my time posting.  But I have to say, Western Dental really just did it for me.  Never mind the bad experience with my braces treatment.  The reason I stopped going to my braces treatment was due to poor communication between staff and doctors that made it difficult to get anything done with my treatment.  As soon as I got those suckers off, I didn't even go to a follow up appointment.  As soon as I could I paid off my contract balance in September.  After many many phone calls and back in forth with customer service, billing, finance, collections. I found out the person who took my last payment failed to cancel auto pay.  In October, they took an unauthorized payment from my account.  When I called them, they said, they would credit my account with in 30 days(why it takes soo long, when it's not even my fault) who knows,  and cancel officially auto pay.  November comes along, they do refund my money, but guess what, they take it right back out with another unauthorized auto payment.  When I call, they say they will "cancel auto payment this time" and credit my account until December.  It's now Dec. 21 "over a month now" and no refund.  Thank goodness, someone manged to cancel autopay, but still I can't get anyone to refund my money for the Nov payment.  Customer service is horrible, it seems like no one knows how the system runs in their own corporate office.  I've never felt so much frustration.  It almost seems like they will never refund my money back.  By the way, I just saw just now, that they have 1.4 stars.  How do they even have almost 2 stars.< /Text>< Pictures>

This company has been owing me a refund for over 8 months and I have yet to receive it. I have called the corporate office over ten times and no one has the sense to finally get this issue resolved. Don't trust western dental because they will definitely rip you off.<//Text>

<text>I am an ortho patient at the Alta Loma  Office. I'm totally disappointed with the services. I believe there a rip off scam . I only need my braces n for a year and was charge as if  was keeping them on for 3 years or more over $3100. No only  did they placed the fluoride on my teeth and turn them Yellow and there still yellow after being placed on there over 5 month ago after I was told it will only last 2 weeks. When I mentioned it to them they wanted me to pay over $100 to get them cleaned after it was there fought. I reach out to the corporate office and when they finally got back to me. all they said was there's nothing they could do. well there is something I can do. Then they have a doctor that does not have a clue what she doing my teeth only shifted a little that why I placed them back on . I had no gaps. now I have gaps my teeth and there crocked. I'm very upset I want the agreement cancel and a refund of the payment I provided. if not I filing a small claims in the small claim court. or I will get a lawyer it will be worth it.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1533333151104<//date><username>Traci Swanson<//username>< Response>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>THIS IS THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL DENTAL COMPANY I HAVE EVER SEEN.  STAY AWAY!  My name is, Patrick Alexander, and I am a Life & Health Agent for Twin Insurance Services in Southern California.  I accompanied one of my clients to Western Dental to have some work done.  They wrote her a contract for the work to be done and she started making payments in excess of $2000.  When she went back to have the work done the contract they had was different than the contract I had.  We have been trying for over 2 months now to get her a refund with no assistance WHAT SO EVER!  I have never seen a medical practice like this one, it is truly heartbreaking to watch my client continue to suffer from much needed dental work yet the company won't refund her despite not having done any services.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>First, this is not a complaint against the dentist or the clinical staff who I found to be very competent.  As for Western Dental's practices, this place is a SCAM!!!  I went to their Gilroy office for cleaning and a cavity and was told that I could not refuse the Gingival Irrigation which increased my cost from $187 to $585.  $49 per quad, twice...$392.00.
This is not true, nor ethical and per my insurance company not necessary.  Following up with complaint to the California Dental Board, although based on the nonchalant attitude when I called corporate to complain, this is not new to this company.  They were eager to cancel my follow up appointment without even asking why at the local office.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

My son is receiving care at the branch in Compton on Long Beach blvd and the front office staff is horrendous . He has braces and it is so hard to get an appointment with the Orthodontist. His last appointment which was last week we waited 2 hours and 15 min  to be scene. I work in a doctors office so I understand that the staff can't control the doctors time but the staff was so rude when I asked " How much longer would it be ?" I mean I felt HORRIBLE after leaving the office that day. They were rude, standoffish,  and so unprofessional. Honestly, I've experienced this since my first appointment there. I feel like I made a bad choice while handling my son's healthcare. Also, at his last appointment I was notified he'll be under the care of a different Orthodontist who has a total different approach then the previous one. Which means more time on his current contract !!!!! I am so bothered by this office</Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< gmapID>

Okay I went to my local Western Dental and was treated horribly!!!  First of all the receptionist in the ortho department  yelled across the room because my kids wanted to help fill out the paperwork they give you. I’m 40 years old with 6 kids. I’m blind as a bat..  I’ve always had help filing out them packets. Never had any problems. This 18/19 year old girl yells excuse me you need to fill that out yourself.. They can’t help you. When I look back at her, and asked why? She smart mouthed back because YOURRRR the PARENT!!

KEEP IN MIND THE LOBY WAS PACKED.  Embarrassed doesn’t begin to describe how I felt. So after about 10 mins or so I got one packed done, and she called up one child’s name... I got happy. She asked me if I’m done?  I replied, Ya with one, not both... She said. “ Well you can either hurry up and finish or  reschedule because the ortho stuff is getting ready to go home... I said what?? Then she continued to tell me to just come back in the following week because it give me time to finish the paperwork. Here my problem the time she’s saying staff is going home was the same time that my second child’s appointment was  schedule .. 4:30! Ummm how you figure that. Why are they sending me away when I have another appointment slot. Trying to act like I’m taking long to fill out paperwork. Sooo rude.

So I leave, then go home and call to get the gals name so I can talk with manager about this situation.. Wouldn’t you know the person who answered the phone acted stupid soon as they realized why I was calling and refused to give me anyone’s names.. oh, talk about playing games!! A bunch of adults going to a training school for a year and half and no one can teach then a little class.

As a local business owner I can tell you that that no way to treat people. I had to call corporate. I don’t know if it helped, however the reviews speak for themself. It’s to bad that they are about the only option many people have who need to make payments. I can tell you have six kids this is the only reason I am forced to keep going back. Maybe the bad reviews will help them improve things. Train their workers or start to let go staff who mistreat and act disrespectful toward patient..< /review>

This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at any type of medical/dental facility....
I was seen fairly quickly, the dentist and assistant were decent, but while I was lying in the exam chair (in excruciating pain from an exposed nerve in my tooth)
This receptionist kept coming back to get my credit card to pay for my tooth extraction.
 The first time she made a mistake and overcharged  me for unwanted products I explained I didn't want. She again took my card to void out the first charge of $84.70
 She Charged my card a second time for the corrected amount of $59.70.
 She returned a third time to inform me I still owed the office approximately $10.
I instructed her to use my card. She replied to me that my card was declined for insufficient funds.(I'm starting to panic)
 I asked why the voided sale amount from the first charge wasn't on my card?( By now I'm numb but really confused )  She told me a voided sale amount wasn't going to be back on my card for 24 hours.
 I explained to her the funds on my card ( which was plenty to cover my $59.70 copay) was all the money I had until my payday. She suggested I set up an autopay contract to deduct the money from my card the following day when she informed me that the voided sale amount would be back on my card. I am hurting, my numbing medicine is wearing off, and she brings me 3-4 receipts to sign.
This receptionist comes to me again shortly after my tooth was extracted to tell me the office wasn't going to charge me the $10 balance I owed (for her damn mistake) and gave me a copy of the voided sale receipt and the final sale receipt along with a copy of the service I received. AGAIN SHE INFORMED ME MY VOIDED SALE AMOUNT WOULD BE BACK ON MY CARD 24 HOURS FROM THEN!
Needless to say, the voided sale amount WAS NOT ON MY CARD 24 HOURS LATER!!! It took me 4 days of calling to Western Dental Corporate Office, being transferred to countless phone operators who claim they only know how to make appointments!  (Beyond Madening)
I finally found out from a supervisor I demanded to speak to that there will be an audit report done and a refund process began that will take 15-40 business days to know where my money went and when it will be returned to me. (Seriously )
Very unprofessional and the receptionist should NOT be allowed to ask  people for credit cards while they are incapacitated and in excruciating pain.

My advice to you is :
TAKE CASH WITH YOU TO PAY FOR SERVICES RENDERED!!
NEVER GIVE YOUR CARD TO A RECEPTIONIST TO SWIPE FOR PAYMENT IF YOU AREN'T DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM!
A $60 dentist bill ended up costing me $140 that day
I still haven't heard back from the corporate office about my refund.

I know I will NEVER make that mistake again, sadly you don't expect something like this to happen from your dentist.</Text>

Crawn look like crack when they made add top porcelain. I ask why is that? They said it is teeth shape?????. I never saw that tipe teeth shape. 3-4 times they chance crown, bridge. Look like unprofessional made in lab.  All bridge and crown worse. I am very sad.  I go end of the January Santa Ana office I wait one hour.  After one doctor come she  tell me I am not you doctor. You doctor she is not in the office until middle the March. I ask I have a pain and bleeding. crown very sensitive, each side bridge sit  to much inside gum and bleeding, hard cleaning. She said wait until she  come back after 1.5 months. I don't want put either one star. Western dental service. But computer not posted if you not click star. I called many times customer service. No one take care problem. They hang up or transfer many deportment and end of they hang up. When they know  I have issue they disconnect phone. Don't waist you time and money.

<text>I can truthfully say I regret all business I ever did with this company. Especially the staff at the clinics, my god, what a nightmare. HOW DO YOU ALLOW SOMEONE TO SIGN UP FOR AUTO-PAY AND NOT EVER SEND THEM A RECIEPT OR A STATEMENT?! Everything about this company is garbage. Its my own fault for not listening to the reviews.
When I reached out to ask for a statement, they said they would send me a "courtesy" one. Like they're doing me a favor for paying them . Ugh!!!</text>< Pics>

Greedy, liars, thieves, employees who can not even speak without grammatical errors. This is truly an out rage. Taking money, making up new contracts once one is already in place, changing prices along the way, loosing payments, claiming not to have received payments, tacking on more to pay at the end. Taking one to collection because your contract was finished PAID off 100% and then they decide to add on another $900 more to an additional contract that was never even drawn up till the end of the service. This is corrupt beyond corrupt. I would take down each one of those mo fo's if even given a chance.<//text><name>Kristen Hill</name><time>1404422524221< /time><user>117824775136151945237< /user>< Rate>

My 8 yr old was referred from tr Vista office to see a specialist at the Venice & Western office. First of all it looks horrible and dirty from the outside , even my son had a comment about way the building looks. Then when we got inside and checked in, the staff could not find his paperwork from the other office, then we waited for an hour , when we finally got called in, they had the wrong X-ray and then they displayed someone else X-ray on the screen. finally after all that was figured out the Dentist Dr Knapp was extremely rude and did not want to discuss anything with me , she tried to kick me out of the room. Then she walked my son to another room and wanted to strap him down and did not want me anywhere in sight, after fussing at her she refused to see him. VERY Rude and she has a short temper as if she is on the verge of a break down  when a parent has questions for her.</Review>

THERE SHOULD BE CRIMINAL CHARGES BROUGHT UP TO THIS COMPANY'S BILLING DEPARTMENT. MY ACCOUNT WAS PAID OFF, SEVERAL MONTH LATER I STARTED RECEIVING COLLECTION LETTERS FOR 2 DIFFERENT AMOUNTS. AFTER PRESENTING COPIES OF CONTRACT AND PAID AMOUNTS TO THE PASADENA OFFICE , MANAGER WHO'S  NAME IS ANA AGREED TO SUBMIT AN ADJUSTMENT. SEVERAL MONTH LATER NO ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN DONE AND COLLECTION  IS POSTED ON  MY CREDIT REPORT.  AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORST, WHEN I ASKED FOR AN ITEMIZED BILL, THEY EMAILED ME MY BILL ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER PATIENT FILES. THEY DON'T EVEN PAY ATTENTION WHEN THEY MAKE HIPPA VIOLATIONS. I ALSO FILED A COMPLAINT WITH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.HOPE THEY CAN HELP. IT'S DISTURBING THAT WESTERN DENTAL  CAN GET AWAY WITH WITH SUCH A WRONGFUL ACCUSATIONS , POST A NEGATIVE INFORMATION ON CREDIT REPORTS, AND HARASS THEIR CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY GOT PAID THE AMOUNT THAT WAS ON THEIR CONTRACT.STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.< /Text>

<review>WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  TIMELINE:
1st visit 1989 and many visits since
1989- had major work in Western Dental Hawthorne Blvd, Lawndale, CA
1992 to 1999 numerous minor visits
2001-2002- visits for after assault work
March 2012- spent $6,000 over what my insurance crowns, root canals
May-June 2015- had more work done approx. $2k. Left being told paid up
October/November 2016- pain from non cavity hole in tooth. before they
just puts drops said nothing can be done
November/December 2016 made appointment. Went in told cannot see
me I was in collections-would not tell me what for or how much. Made
me look like a fool in front of at least 10-15 customers.Later I
contacted support says cannot tell me what collection was for-I said I
am the patient. After 5 people I ended up with Argon collection agency
who would not tell me anything, just said give me a credit card or I will
ruin your credit, which they had already done . My FICA went from 805
to 699. I contested with all Credit agencies and won. Come to find out
they  filed incorrectly to insurance company, so $700.00 not paid. they
were sending bill to wrong Address. I have statement from person
who received my bills and returned. I had to pay almost 900.00 on
December 11, 2016 to clear.
March 22, 2017- I called to make appointment as the pain has become
unbearable, 4 people told me I was in collections even though I paid
back in December. Person #5 at Western Dental corporate offices- "Oh
I see you already paid. Someone forgot to un-flag you". I said sho do I
complain to  about all this mess. It is all you guy's fault. Oh let me
transfer you- after 30 minutes i hung up
March 17, 2017- later that day. I called and was on a phone with operator
at Western Dental for about 20 minutes. She called the Office I was to
go to to see if they  would see me with no problem now. She came back
and said yes they will see you, no problem. So I go at 3PM. Again in
front of no less than 10 people they embarrass me by telling me loudly
you cannot be seen you are in collections.
that is it I am done, I will make sure I post this same complaint on Twitter,
Linkedin, facebook(numerous pages) as well as any other site that will let me post. I am also going to send our local news stations with watchdog reporting this story as well as a letter to the editor in the local newspaper.

it may not be much, but if I can save a few people the agony Western Dental gave me- the better I will feel!!
IT WAS MARCH 22 NOT MARCH 17TH LATER THAT DAY WHEN I WAS TOLD I COULD GO IN, SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1490454602935, 'text': 'Hello Charles,\n\nWe are sorry to hear that we are not meeting up to your expectations.\n\nI have attempted to reach out to you regarding this matter.

(((ZERO STARS))) I came to western dental  6 months pregnant with a broken molar. they charged me so much to fix it and i was not in the mood to wait around until the baby was born. when i went to get my replacement crown they could not find it.... i had to go back and have a new model of my teeth re done sooooo annoying... so finally went back and had it done. once it was done i noticed that they tooth was not along the gum line there was too much space between the tooth and the gum line. i asked and they said that i needed to give it time so my gums will get used to the false tooth being there... anyhow time passed and 3 yrs later i wake up and my face was the size of a beach ball the tooth was infected. bacteria and food had gotten into the tooth because of the space between the tooth and gum line. (((WORST PAIN EVER!!!)))  I had to miss work and have a retreatment on the tooth and pay another 3 grand AT THAT POINT I WENT TO ANOTHER DENTIST WAS NOT GOING TO RISK DEALING WITH THE BS... now im stuck with WD on my credit for a shotty job... DO NOT GO HERE.!!!!

THEN HERES THE ICING ON THE CAKE I HAVE 2 DIFFERENT BALANCES ONE FROM WD AND ONE FROM A COLLECTION COMPANY ON MY CREDIT REPORT AND NEITHER SAY THAT THEY CAN TAKE ONE OFF... WTH IS UP WITH THAT??<//Review>

This company is just the worst. 3 times I've called in to make an appt, only to find that when I went to my local office that corporate screwed things up, and didn't schedule my appt right. Very, very poor.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Every time someone speaks to make an appointment they take more than 20 minutes reviewing your entire history. If you are already a patient, I don't see why you have to give all your information and ask for only the basics. They could be more direct and just schedule the appointment!

(Original)
Cada vez que habla uno para hacer una cita se tardan mas de 20min repasando todo tu historial.  Si ya eres paciente no veo por que tener que dar toda tu información y pedir solo lo básico. Podrían ser más  directos y solo programar la cita!<//review>

(Translated by Google) I really liked the treatment they have given me. At the reception they are very friendly. And the lady who made me the XRAY treated me very well. Her name is Juanita.
The doctor is very kind.
I recommend this place. Everything is perfect there. They recently opened this location, because not all of them treat you well.
1575 N. Grand Avenue Santa Ana, CA 92705
Asa is the address.

La doctora es muy amable.
Recomiendo este lugar. Todo es perfecto ahi. Hace poco que abrieron esta locacion, por que no en todas tratan a uno bien.

(Translated by Google) I had an appointment, they gave me a credit card and they gave me the bill, they took out two teeth in a few days, they gave me the tooth, everything was alive until I got the tooth, they gave me an appointment, I went at 8am when the dentist saw the tooth, he said that it was not permanent, in addition to his very dirty robes, the Dr had a nail full of fungus, it gave me disgust and if I want a permanent tooth, it is the same total 5,000 dollars for a tooth because I have never heard two bad bones and faces here in pittsburg and That is not all, they injected me with an anesthetic that gave me a cold and it was hot time until my contract form, I have to see how I jumped from cold and lasted until 11 at night that intense cold in the heat of the that day
and they say that they planted me 2 little bones of 400.00 dlrs each, I think they are lies, nor did the wound hurt me.

(Original)
tuve una cita me dieron crédito Card y lla que firme me dieron la cuenta me sacaron dos dientes en unos días me dieron el diente todo viva bien hasta que se kebro el diente me dieron una cita fui a las 8am cuando vio el dentista el diente dijo que no era permanente además sus batas bien sucias el Dr tenía una uña llena de fungus me dio asco y si quiero diente permanente es otro tanto total 5.000 dlrs por un diente porque eso que dos huesitos nunca lo e oído malos y caretos aquí en pittsburg y eso no es todo me inyectaron una anestesia que me dio un frío y era tiempo de calor asta en mi forma de contrato se a de ver como brincaba yo de frío y me duró asta las 11 de la noche ese frío intenso enmedio del calor que había ese dia
y disen que me plantaron 2 huesitos de 400.00 dlrs cada uno creo que son mentiras ni morado se me puso la herida.</review>
