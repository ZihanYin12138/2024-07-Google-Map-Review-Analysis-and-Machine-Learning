< review>
I am not sure I have ever had such an artistic and precise hairstylist. I have short hair which I wish to have heavily textured. Rose walked up to  me and immediately not only understood my desire, she read my hair, face shape, and cowlicks. She went to work, instinctively clipping the way my hair needed to be clipped. I am so grateful for the exceptional experience.<//review>

Rabih is an amazing hairdresser and human being.  He took his time and was very detailed with the style that he had in mind for me.  I completely left it in his hands and the end result was amazing!</Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<Review>Wonderful salon.  Extreme talent.  Large salon with comfortable leather couches.  Owner and hairdressers are very friendly.  I have been going for many years. Try it once and I guarantee you won't go anywhere else.  I drive an hour not just for my perfect hair but the lovely staff.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80d95523c9077195:0xa15e7175f10bc152</Gmap_id></record>

Mariana always does an amazing job with my eyelash extensions! I’m new to getting eyelash extensions so I was unsure of what kind of volume/length i wanted at first, but mariana let me know what would look good with my eye shape, and they came out so good, and i get so many compliments. Will definitely keep coming back to her because now I’m obsessed with getting them done.<//text>

< Review>
Definitely hard finding a great salon. My first time at Frederick Michael Salon and it was amazing. Jessica was my stylist. She made sure I was comfortable the whole time during my appointment. She was easy to talk to. I showed her a picture of the hair style I wanted and she made it happen. She also gave me a great blow out. She really exceeded my expectations.

Salon is also clean and well kept. Price is great. I will definitely be coming back for all my haircuts at mure. Appointments are super easy to set up online.<//Review>

<review>Great salon, even greater staff. Frederick Michael Salon is a one-stop shop for everything. Cosmetics, nails, hair, spa treatments, etc. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for the highest quality of care.

When I think of a great salon, I believe it must have:
1. An exceptional location, Check.
2. A warm and inviting atmosphere, Check.
3. Professionals intent on making you comfortable, Check.
4. Time-oriented to my schedule, well... Check. haha
5. They make you look freaking good!!!! Check.

Just remember that these people have an extremely high rent bill based on location convenience for their clients. I generally tip 20% to my barber, and will continue to go to him for as long as he's still kicking!

Try this spot out. You won't regret it.</review>< resp>

However, parking is a nightmare. Arrive early and be prepared to hunt for a space. The spaces are also extremely small.

Inside the salon is bustling with people. There are so many stylists that it can be overwhelming for first time clients. Just wait in the little seating area and wait till someone helps you.< /review><rating>4< /rating><name>Aurianna Bonanno<//name>< Date>

I have never had such a horrible experience in a salon.  I went to Kim Brown, who rents a booth there, and only learned of the name she bills under by the receipt sent to me via e-mail.  I then looked up reviews on her and they were horrible.  But the reviews for Frederick Michael Salon are not but they are not about her.  My hair was longer on one side than the other and I asked her to fix it.  She agreed and when I got there I said that I had never paid so much for a color and cut ($225.00) and thought I should love my hair.  She immediately started to defend herself and proceeded to start screaming at me.  By that time I didn't want her to do anything to my hair and told her I had read bad reviews about her but did not have the information to check them before coming in.  She told me I was creepy and not to come back.  I was shocked at the manner in which she behaved.  There was a man working in the attic above the room she rents in the salon and he met me out in the hallway after she slammed the door in my face.  He looked for the owner but he was not there.  I wanted to dispute the charges for the first time in my life (and I am 62 years old) but I will go to someone else and eat the charges.  I would be afraid of physical violence from a person like that.  If you call and they send you to her, STAY AWAY.</text>

This last time I was there, I actually went in the salon to use the restroom then waited on a lounge chair 'til he was done. There wasn't anyone at the reception desk and another person had been standing there waiting to be greeted, so I ended up asking a hair dresser where the bathroom was. And what I noticed was how filthy this place was! For a public restroom, I could tell that the toilet and sink hadn't been cleaned in awhile. The couch and lounge chairs were stained and dirty. There were magazines strewn around on the coffee tables. And when I was browsing their jewerly table, there were broken earrings and torn price tag on table and they could've been straightened up to look a little more presentable for display. My son and I really do like his hair dresser so we'll be coming back, but this place needs to be cleaner.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>This place is the best storage facility I’ve ever rented at. I own 3 local coffee shops in the Riverside County area, so I really have to make sure I am choosing a safe, secure, and quiet location when I rent a unit. This place checks all of those boxed, and then some! Daisy and Tommy (the managers) really run an awesome facility! When I bring my belongings and other essential equipment necessary for running my business, I need to be 100% sure they are safe and secure, and this place really goes above and beyond to put my mind at ease. They even have an on site manager who lives there to make sure our stuff is extra safe! Now that is dedication lol Thanks again Daisy! Keep up the good work!< /Review><user_name>Jeremy Gaunt<//user_name><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_id>

This location always has the best customer service. So far Denise has been the one to help me out and she had been always professional and friendly. She’s funny too and make the process easy and comfortable to me. She explained everything to me so I could understand about the spaces and policy. Strongly recommended to friends and family!</text>

3 robberies this week at this location. I came to my unit on Black Friday to find It broken in to along with approx 10 other units. Our items were all over the hallway. I called the police and they took a statement. PS District Manager Fernando showed up & said He was aware that our units were broken in to on Thanksgiving but because it was a holiday he didn’t go to the facility,  no explanation on why I wasn’t called and told my unit was broken in to. I just randomly showed up to drop off some things and walked in to find boxes thrown all over and torn open.

PLEASE do NOT rent from them!!  NO cameras at their location. They put ALL the responsibility on the insurance company to cover losses. and they took NO steps to protect our things once the items were all over the hallway.

Norco Police have assigned a case number for all victims. Call them to file a report if you were robbed</text>

Daisy is Awesome!  I needed to get a storage unit, reserved it online, I had a call back from Daisy to schedule the appointment to come and decide what size unit was going to work best for me.  Daisy was very friendly and helpful... once I got there I was greeted with a smile and I noticed how clean the office looked and smelled, you can tell she takes pride in her job.  Daisy was able to work with Fernando the district manager to get me a great deal and together we figured out what size would work for me  and was able to start moving in about an hour later...The whole process was fast and easy.  Thank You Daisy for all your help, its much appreciated!<//text>

She has a great understanding of her job. More employees should be as accommodating as she is. Daisy is awesome! 🤗 However, they work on lowering unit prices that will be great.
I have been at public storage for over 1 year and the service is awesome .

<Text>Highly recommended this place. I’ve dealt with both Daisy and Tommy over here at Public Storage in Norco and every time I’m happy with their professionalism and great attitude. It always seems like they genuinely care about my needs when I come in. Whether it’s finding me the best deal possible or something as small as opening the bathroom lol they always treat me great. Oh and the place is always clean when I come by, that says a lot about how much a person cares in my opinion lol<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcc9daf45725e1:0x535d222217aef834< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Like pretty much everyone else, I had Daisy assisting me. I reserved a spot online, I don't know if it made a difference or not but it was all ready to go when I got there. Walked to the unit, inspected it, and handed me the keys. Paperwork was relatively quick signing on an iPad. I hope the check out process is just as easy!< /Review>

<Review>Daisy Flores & Aaron Freire were amazing and great they went above and beyond and mentioned to me about a one time fee waiver. For a late fee. There customer service was 5star. I would highly recommend this property. They mentioned the fee waiver might work but no guarantee. Just the nice part of mentioning.<//Review>< response>

I stopped by my storage unit and completely forgot to grab a tape measure on my way out. Michelle was there and improvised for me by taping a few sheets of 8.5 x 11 white paper together. It worked out fine. Thanks!< /review>

Between Martika's help over the phone and Daisy's assistance this past weekend getting my storage unit dialed in, I can't say enough about how awesome these two ladies are. Extremely professional, incredibly helpful and just overall pleasant to work with. Moving is never fun and having this part of the experience go as smoothly as it did, made the process so much easier.
Thanks so much! You gals are awesome. :)</Text>

<text>We have been using the Public Storage Facility in Hamner Ave, Norco for over a year and we would like to commend Jess the Property Manager for his  great customer service and professionalism. Jess is managing the facility with great care and ensuring tight security. Although we are aware of the frequency of Santa Ana winds constantly posing a challenge and dust issue on the area, we had observed that during the times we had visited our storage unit, the pathways always look clean. Thus far, thank God we have not had any problem. We would like to keep using the Public Storage and hope that we can  keep the monthly rent low and not be subject for any increases in the near future.< /text>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Everyone, ESPECIALLY Michelle, has been so helpful!!!  We've had to change units twice.  The last time, my 84 year old Aunt's moving truck was here and she realized her unit would be too small.  It was dark, pouring rain and cold.  It was 2 minutes after 6pm when I ran into the office to ask if we can move into a bigger unit so we wouldn't have to move all the stuff again.  She called her boss and they gave her permission to help us.
She is a wonderful and considerate person and it's nice to see customer service is alive.  Public Storage should be proud to have her as an employee.  She is always cheerful.  Once, when I couldn't find my cellphone after rearranging things, she walked out with me to the unit and called my phone until we found it under a box!!  Can not really say enough of how nice she and the others have been.

<review>Initial experience was satisfactory with good customer service (Katie).  Went back a month later to transfer the unit to someone else and that's when everything went down hill.  The rep who claimed to be the manager (Martika), was rude and condescending when I simply asked her for proof of the cancellation of my unit.  She kept arguing with me showing me on her computer screen, however I wanted a hard copy as proof of the cancellation.  Will not go back, or recommend to anyone.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I have only been in the area for 6 or so months, moving into an unfamiliar place and in need of storing my belongings.  I found Public Storage, and Martika.... This facility is amazing,  and clean... The Staff (Martika) is one of the first that I met here in Norco and she is a blessing. She is very friendly and professional at same time.  PUBLIC STORAGE this employee is a Major Asset to your company.  She made me feel right at home here.

I would recommend this Public Storage Location (and do) to everyone.
Needs to have more Stars on this one...< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have been storing with public storage for over a year and have no complaints. The facility is great, good prices i've stored at other storages and they were cheap bad service. With public storage I feel safe storing there. Customer service is always great with the girls there daisy and martika< /review>

This is an older structured (compound looking establishment with a very high price rating and you are required to pay unessary insurance (for what).. convient location and okay kept. The restrooms are locked (unless requested)..if no one's in the office it's your fault for drinking too much water (hehe)..besides everything else all the staff(s) are pretty cool and informative..Public Storage..LOWER YOUR PRICE, cut the unessary insurance rates and allow access to the restrooms..Thanks guys!!</Review>

Ingrid was amazing today. Great customer service. They checked my vehicle and are super honest. I brought my other vehicle here and left satisfied. I highly recommend them.
12/21/20: came back again and Farris and Felix were wonderful and full of helpful information.
Very helpful. I went to Toyota and they told me I had an oil pan leak and Felix showed me I don’t have an oil pan leak that everything is perfectly dry. I appreciate honesty 💯!!!!!</review>

Fair price, quick service. Informed me of manufacturer recommendations and gave me options, but I did not feel pressured. Let me know of low fluids and other maintenance issues before they addressed them. Very professional. Wiping windows and vacuuming the car a little is a nice touch.

The driveway off of the street has a large bump where the sidewalk is. It scraped the bottom of my car. If your car has low clearance, go in the back way.< /Review>

We were visiting from San Jose when the first oil light came on my F150. I didn’t want to try to wait until we got back not San Jose to have the oil changed so I started looking. Found this gem, they got me in quick, very professional and super nice. They even cleaned my windows and the price was very fair. Wish all Jiffy  lube was like this one.< /Text>

<text>I think the new system of staying in your car is great!

It’s fun to help out and see what they’re doing, and to know it’s going as fast as possible.

My vote is for it to remain an optional service!

Thanks again PB Jiffy Lube<//text>< Pics>

These people were amazing. They were so friendly and accommodating. They were helpful with using the coupons and promotions that were posted online. I came in for an oil change and a tire rotation. I got a call from them saying the tire rotation was not needed. I really appreciate them not doing it any way and charging me for a pointless service. Especially being a woman, its common for men in the auto service industry to use their title and expertise against the naive. I will definitely be coming back again!< /Text>

I was getting an oil change on a high-end sports car and it only took about 20 minutes for my car to be finished, even though there were several people in front of me in line.  The price was similar to, say, a Valvoline at about $100 or an oil change. The workers were helpful and courteous, and there's several places to sit down so that one is not left standing around waiting. Overall, a good experience.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The workers here not only care about you, but the community around us. A car accident happened out front of their shop and 2 workers came out and assessed the situation while I called for help. They made sure not the move the lady complaining of neck pain, and got the drunk lady to the side of the road. They have a good crew, affordable prices, and a light hearted atmosphere.</review>

<Review>First visit they offered some things I declined (way lower than other similar shops). Second visit on they never offered more than I asked for.. maybe they keep good notes.

I feel they did the job right every time. I feel that I can trust them (that is hard with any automotive services in my experience... I do know a few honest mechanics in San Diego).

Very quick and affordable. Try the same service at a dealership.. This is far more affordable.<//Review>< Date>

Fast professional service. Came in for oil change, coolant flush and transmission flush. No push for things that were not needed, ie air filter didn't need to be replaced they only recommended it be changed at the next oil change. Guys were all very polite, wish I had tried this place sooner. Thanks guys!<//review>

I went there and they took care of my car in 10 min (it wasn't busy but still). Everyone was extremely nice and they were honest and didn't try to up sell me on anything. The guy I worked with told me there was a coupon when I asked and he walked me through everything about my car. I am definitely going there again!</review>

My husband took my car in to get the AC fixed. D. Lopez filled it up with freon and said it was good to go. Cost of the "Quality Inspection" was $153. A week goes by and my AC is blowing somewhat cool air but is still not working as it should be and is not sufficiently cooling the car. My husband takes it in again. Explains to Christopher A. what's going on. He checks everything he can check and says that everything looks fine, but it might be something that they are unqualified to repair. He says they will issue a full refund and recommends going to a mechanic who can investigate the problem further. As my husband pulls out, he notices immediately that the air is now coming out very hot, much worse than it was before he brought it back the second time. So, he goes back to ask Christopher why that is happening now, asked whether or not he had removed all of the freon. Christopher said that he had had in fact refilled the freon entirely, and that it was likely that the AC had just coincidentally died.. just then. My husband then took the car to a mechanic who informed him that there was ZERO freon in there! I don't know if Christopher was lying, or just incompetent. A freon refill with the mechanic was only $80 also. So, don't waste your time coming to Jiffy Lube for AC problems. Go to a mechanic that can properly diagnose the problem, and won't just refund your money after making the problem worse.<//Review>

<text>Took my car in over the weekend for an oil change and left missing my prescription medication that I had left on my door panel.  I called the Store Manager (Jesus) when I realized it was missing and he made it seem like it was my fault.   They have no cameras so they have nothing to review so I was told.  He said he was “going to ask around”.   No one other than my self enters my car.   Both the tire lug and the old Jiffy Lube oil change notification window sticker where placed in the drivers side door panel where my medication was last seen by coincidence.  I’m hoping my medication “pops up” at the shop since it is expensive for prescriptions and it has no street value.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Best customer service here, the service was extremely quick & the technician who serviced my oil change suggested I seek new tires immediately as they had some hazardous gashes that I had not seen prior to that. They were truly concerned- and were extremely helpful. Did not try to 'up sell' me or make me purchase anything aside from oil change.<//review>

GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! I just got my oil changed here and that will be the last time I go here. When I got home, I noticed a dent on my hood. How do you do that during an oil change?! I know it wasn't there when I brought it in because I showed the guy go to pop open the hood. My car is dirty and you can see the spot where the dent is and someone wiped the dirt away. Never go here!! It's always dead anyways.<//text>

The level of incompetence that has been shown from this facility is pure ignorance. Came in with my boyfriend to have his oil changed as well as a transmission flush... ever since doing so, the engine has been making sounds it never used to make, and it idles very rough. I would NOT suggest bringing your vehicle here unless you'd like to purchase a new one shortly after. A monkey with a wrench could've done a better job! Very displeased.</Review>

My wife took her car in to have her oil changed. The employee told her she Needed to pay $100 for oil and that the normal $40 oil wasn't allowed for her car. He called her condescending names after she declined his up-selling techniques and treated her even worse. He continued to pressure her the whole time into buying pointless upgrades and would murmur rude remarks after she said no. I will not send an email to your corporate office, so please don't try to fix this Mr. Manager. You should be ashamed to say that you care about giving good service.</Review>

<Text>Poor service. I wrote an email to Jiffy lube opinion . com

A guy named "Wagner" failed to give me a reasonable price on an oil change.  He also said "thats what my manager would say also".  Jiffy Lube wouldnt match an earlier quoted price that I received over the phone.  I was told three different prices 24.99, 34.99, and finally after I showed up 39.99.  I couldn't spend any money at this location because of the poor service.  If and when I receive a coupon from Jiffy Lube for an oil change I will go back to this location with a grin on my face.

Also be aware there isn't enough clearance to enter from the street into the property, you will scrape the underside of your car.< /Text>< Rating>

One of the best places to get a healthy snack or lunch. Always fresh and you can choose from a great variety of fillings for your sub. Would much rather eat from here than any of the other fast food outlets. You know exactly what you are getting and I've never had anything less than a delicious meal every time I've visited any Subway outlet. A genuine 5* place.</Text>

<Text>I love going to Subway. There the food is really fresh because you get to watch it being maded.

The selection is crazy, and very affordable. They always have specials going on, just ask.

They used to do only cold sandwiches, but now they have hot sandwiches, sliders, wraps, and salads.

If you haven't had a Subway sandwich before, or if it's been awhile.  Go get one!< /Text>< rating>

< Review>
I asked to buy a couple cookies with my sandwich and lady working the counter refused to ring me up. I don’t understand why. I’ve seen cockroaches in here too. Don’t go to this subway. Poor service and bad attitude.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I really like subway, but they do not have a bathroom, you have to go to another restaurant to use the bathroom, it's a bad thing for me

(Original)
Me gusta mucho subway,pero No tienen baño hay que ir  a otro restaurante para usar el baño,es algo malo para mi< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>My friend bought us a box of chocolate, 6-piece Bonbon Collection, from Casa De Chocolates as a birthday gift.

We were impressed with its wrapping, classy and elegant. Each chocolate looked delicate and too beautiful to eat. It also tasted delicious, smooth and is perfectly matched with the filling.<//text>< response>

< Review>
This is a small store in the Elmwood neighborhood with some amazing chocolate bars!  If your a fan of a little spice, some of their chocolate has a wonderful little bit of heat to it.  The Chili mango bars have candied mange along with a bit of chili in them.   The Mole bars have a few spices giving it the flavor of mole and a hint of heat!  These are wonderful.   They also have non spicy chocolate with wondeful accents and flavors.    If you like hot chocolate, be sure to try the hot chocolate with a bit of cinnamon and I believe vanilla, thick and creamy!!

<time>1594574163652</time><rate>5< /rate><review>I’ve had this place three times. The first time my neighbors treated me to the frozen Mexican hot chocolate, and the second time they did the same thing. Yesterday, the third time, I treated their daughters to a bunch of small chocolates (bc the frozen hot chocolate was sold out :/) and I got their salted caramel candy for myself which was absolutely delicious!

This place offers delightful treats on hot summer days, you’d be crazy not to try it. :)

The people at the counter are always so friendly too!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOKHhudVgNW0IdKKFsCkNy3w0q6302qH52OY29=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2K4p9JPN4jZ-GdfE_ZrIe1ToZvOh9wDVe0wyI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

Exquisite. Intense flavors. One-of-a-kind chocolates!! Bought a box of bonbons for Día de Los Muertos: tequila, mole, tamarind truffles = adult trick-or-treats.< /text>

<text>Found the tres leches cake here when I was on my period, on a hunt for chocolate, about 7 years ago. I come back weekly. It's the cake of all cakes. It's my sister's birthday cake. It's a gift for friends. It's everything you need it to be unless it's sold out. Then, it's just sad.</text>< pictures>

Their chocolate is alright. Store experience: when we asked to try their mango chili chocolate, they told us they ran out. (Why couldn’t they open a new pack since there are plenty on the shelf?) When we decided to purchase three small packs, we unwittingly broke one (we didn’t notice we broke it), their sales boy came to us and told us that it’s their store policy for the customer to purchase any broken by them.<//text>

Phenomenal, authentic chocolates. The hot chocolate drinks are just the right kind of spiced and surprisingly cheap compared to the artisan chocolates that they also sell. I would go just to soak up the smells.</Text>

<text>An excellent Chocolatier for high-cocoa chocolates.  They have bars, bonbons, truffles, and seasonally shaped chocolates, as well as one of the best chocolate cakes in the SF Bay Area (the aptly named "El Rey.")  They also serve magnificent chocolate milks, both frosted and heated!

It is not inexpensive, but neither is it likely to break your wallet at around $5 per large chocolate bar and $1-3 per truffle/bonbon.</text></record>

<Review>‎Despite all of the glorious chocolate that can be found all around the shop (I have tried everything in the shop and love everything), my absolute favorite thing to get is the Frozen Mexican Hot Chocolate. YUM. Anytime I am in Berkeley, I try to stop by for both chocolate and my favorite drink. It is truly a gift to the world.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It was a wonderful experience for me.  The aroma made me forget about my pilgrimage from San Mateo this visit and onto the delight of having some delicious chocolates. The staff was busy preparing orders but, not to busy to check on me.  Estefania was well, Sweet as can be as she patiently assisted me with my indecision to choose.  Mmmm.  What fantastic flavors.  Freshly made.  Heaven.  Oh!  Don't forget to order their Chocolate Caliente.  I had mine with Chile de Arbol.  Just the choclety goodness with just the right kick.  Ok.  Yes. I'd recommend Casa de Chocolate to you reading this as I am to my personal Family & Friends!

<review>Casa has the *best* hot chocolate and frozen/blended chocolate drinks ever!!!! There should be lines down Ashby for this treat. They also have a rockin' Tres Leches cake and truffles.  Their chocolate bars and truffle boxes make great gifts too. High quality and beautifully made, this place is truly a gem in the Elmwood.<//review>< pics>

My favorite chocolate shop in the east bay! I love that it's a female-owned business, but that is not the reason for my 5 star rating. The chocolate truffles are! OMG - the liquor-infused truffles are my addiction. SO. DARN. GOOD. Tequila butterflies, Mezcal, Kahlua, Mojito and more. The caramels are delicious also. The other thing that I love here are there small-sized chocolate bars. They break off nicely into just a tiny rectangle of yummy goodness. Perfect for a little sweet treat without feeling like you need to exercise it off right away. Indulge without the guilt! My favorite flavors are mole (a zing of spiciness!) and hibiscus (a great slightly tart twang to it!). I stop by whenever I am in the area. I keep the boxes in my car for refills. :)<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Really good chocolate bars & cupcakes (4/5 green stars).
Casa de Chocolates is becoming my favorite place to pick up gifts for people. Their chocolate boxes are beautiful, and the best thing is that you can bring back the box and they’ll refill it at a significantly reduced rate ($1.50 per piece) so it’s the gift that keeps giving! Their chocolate bars are very inventive, combining great chocolate with South American flavors – I highly recommend their recent addition, the Fuerte bar. It’s topped with roasted quinoa, pepitas (pumpkin seeds), almonds, chili flakes and sea salt. The straight quinoa bar (Inca Crunch) is also wonderful, for those who are chili-averse (not that the Fuerte bar is that spicy). I also crave their luscious chocolate cupcakes regularly – they also have a deal with these: you get a discount if you bring back their little cupcake box for a refill. They can point you towards their vegan offerings, almost everything is gluten free, and they don’t use gelatin. Very friendly staff and chocolate bar samples always available!

I’m giving them 4/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact. They are a Latina-owned business that aims to make delicious chocolates using sustainable ingredients. From their website: “we aim to purchase the chocolate from chocolate purveyors who have a direct relationship with cocoa farmers.  We believe that direct trade with cocoa farmers results in farmers making far more than Fair Trade standards.” But when they opened in 2012, they purchased pre-made chocolate from Guittard, which is somewhat confusing since Guittard do use the official Fair Trade certification system. Most of their chocolate is a South American blend and in some cases they use single origin chocolate (the Quechua bar is Ecuadorian chocolate). In an interview, chocolatier Arcelia Gallardo says that “eventually we want to work with smaller cacao farmers and chocolate makers” but it has been 4 years since they opened, so it’s time they provided an update on their chocolate sourcing – are they still mainly buying from Guittard or are they starting to trade directly with smaller farmers? Not that Guittard is a bad company – most of their cacao is Fair Trade and shade grown; some is organic. Casa de Chocolates don’t mention if any of their cacao is organically grown but the staff member I talked to said she’d find out, so I’ll update that when I go back.

Most of their other ingredients are organic: milk, cream, eggs, butter, flour, confectioners’ sugar, espresso beans, berries and herbs. As mentioned above, they provide good incentives for re-use of packaging used for chocolates and cupcakes, which is really great. But considering that many people won’t be re-using or recycling the packaging it would be better to pack items like flan in small cardboard boxes rather than plastic clamshells.</review>< pictures>

< review>
This is one if my favorite businesses in Berkeley. Excellent quality chocolates, handmade, right there. Delicious. And their chilled and hot chocolate beverages are to die for. Great service and limited people inside the shop for Your Health and Safety during this new time of pandemic. I have also ordered chocolates delivered and those were Fantastic.</review>

<user_id>105699115223360666004</user_id><text>(Translated by Google) I definitely love this place and it brings back good memories. Almost every Friday there they had me buying a cold chocolate drink for myself or my family, I have tried without success in Mexico to find a drink like this.
It is delicious and I highly recommend it.
There is a wide variety of chocolates on offer, as well as seasonal combinations.

Top Tattoo Place in SoCal.  Been going to this place for years. Always clean. Has incredible Service from some of the kooliest Artist.
I feel at home when I'm here and that's important in a shop.

<review>My experience was really nice. I was a walk in & they treated me as a friend. We got tattooed by Nolan & he was easily able to draw what we wanted & both peices came out very nice. I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone who appreciates quality tattoo work.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1562018254827< /date><rating>5</rating><review>Got my first tattoo from Andrea at Third Street on a Friday afternoon and couldn’t have asked for a better first experience. Everyone was pleasant, mostly on the quiet side, a very professional but friendly environment. The shop itself is clean, lots of plastic coverings and looks organized. Each artist has decor in their area, so that was fun to look at as I tried not to flinch my hip off the table. The shop itself looks like everything you want in a tattoo shop- tattoo sketches and art on the walls.

Andrea worked very quickly in both sketching and tattooing, occasionally checking to see if I was okay. I was very nervous beforehand as I had no idea what to expect but I felt comfortable in this environment and Andrea explained the process and typical experience, which helped a lot. I’d recommend her but she’s booked through the rest of the year, so her work speaks for itself :)<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrBnBvvjcpdm8xWo1_Addt_MiTUuud3ZIg-uUa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-UUStyNJQFIRtn3NbInL8dIHaDKFb9rxlBuUC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b482c437656b:0xb73c301b96b7d3c0</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<date>1578242299954</date><resp>None<//resp><review>What this place DOESN'T have is what makes it stand out from the 9 million other shops in Southern California... The attitude.

I've been getting tattooed for 20 years, and it's really rare to walk into a shop and not get an ounce of that 'too cool tough guy' attitude. Very refreshing.

Beyond that the roster is packed with top-notch talent and real experience. Great shop all around.</review>< rate>

I got my first tattoo during a flash event by Sean. He made the experience great! I felt no discomfort and my tattoo turned out so much better that I could have expected! I would absolutely go back for a second tattoo! Also, everyone working there is extremely nice and helpful!<//Review>

<Review>Such an awesome experience!! Jacob at 3rd Street Tattoo is the best! He was very attentive to what I wanted and was able to customize my tattoo in the exact way I wanted it. He made sure I was 100% happy with the design and modified it a few times to get it exactly right. Super professional, patient and very talented. I highly recommend him. The shop is very clean and inviting. If I decide to get another tattoo, I'd definitely go back to him and this shop.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Jacob took me as walk in. Did exactly as I wanted.  The shop was clean and I liked the music they were playing. and this is totally subjective, the shop felt good.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2b482c437656b:0xb73c301b96b7d3c0< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<text>If I could give them more than five stars, I would! Let's start with the artists. Jacob (check out his instagram @jdanhi) did my tattoo and he is a phenomenal tattoo artist who's an expert when it comes to shading. But every artist at Third Street Tattoo is amazing. Each offers a distinctive style of tattooing and can tailor their style to fit your vision.

Their customer service also met and went beyond my expectations. I was there for seven hours getting my tattoo. During that time, I saw how they really did their best to accommodate every single walk in that came through. Plus, they really do try to take care of you. Because of how long my tattoo session was, there were definitely times where I needed to take a break, and Jacob was more than happy to give me all the time I needed. At a couple points, I started feeling really nauseous, which isn't surprising considering how long I was getting tattooed. When I mentioned it, everyone was super helpful. They offered snacks, water and allowed me to lie down for a while until it passed. I don't think I could have finished getting my tattoo if they weren't so understanding, helpful, and patient!

If you're looking to get a tattoo, check this place out! I could not be happier with how it looks and with their customer service.</text>< username>

Love 3rd Street! Super clean, super friendly, tons of great artists. Just a heads up, if you want cash, you'll have to get it before because they have no atm.</Review>

Had the raddest time @ this Tatoo shop. Drove by and stop by on a wim to get my septum pierced and had the most wonderful experience. Nolan took great care of me. I moved a little which totally made it hurt more but that was my fault. He was really fast and the entire staff was so supportive. Pete, another employee there graciously held my hand and let me squeeze the bajesus out him. I felt. Little disoriented after my piercing and they made sure I was okay. They gave me a needed snack and water and he made me wait until he could see I was okay. Nolan made the experience so great thanks to his sweet nature. He gave me his number so I could follow up as well. Ultimate customer service  Thanks guys!! Love my new piercing< /text>

<review>Right off the bat I will take some of the responsibility for not being happy with my tattoo. I have two existing half-sleeves as well as another tattoo, so I do have a little knowledge about having work done. About three weeks ago I went in based on a recommendation to have the initials of two family members who've passed tattooed on the inside of my wrist done in fine line. When I explained what I wanted to the gentleman behind the counter, he replied "no problem" but came back a few minutes later and asked if I would mind having a "guest artist" do the work (mistake number one). I agreed and spoke to the person who was going to do the work. We went back and forth over size and fonts but he kept drawing the initials too large. I asked him repeatedly to make them smaller but he simply replied "it can't be done" (mistake number two). We finally agreed on the size and font and he set to work. He certainly was polite enough, seemed competent, I paid for the tat ($100 for six letters) and left. Three weeks later I now seriously regret letting a "guest artist" work on me. The lines aren't sharp at all, I definitely wouldn't consider it to be fine line work and there's a halo effect around all the letters. Maybe he had too much caffeine that morning, who knows? The bottom line is that I am now looking at laser removal procedures in hopes that most (if not all) the damage can be rectified so I can have someone competent do the work. As mentioned earlier, I have two half-sleeves and both of them have very fine lines that still remain sharp almost 16 years later. Sorry guys but my guess is you let someone who's just starting out mess up the work on one of your customers. You may want to screen your "guess artists" a little more thoroughly in the future.</review>< Pictures>

I paid $160 for them to tattoo "you are my sunshine, my only sunshine" on four of my fingers. Less than a month later the words "are" and "my" are totally faded, as if they were never tattooed onto my skin. I understand that finger tattoos fade over time, but I'm very upset at the fact that i pretty much endured that pain for a partial invisible tattoo. (Pic uploaded)</text>

I got my nose pierced here and he did an amazing job. He and I both agreed on the spot and he doesn't rush you at all. I was very scared that it was going to hurt but he calmed me down and I didn't even feel the needle go throw but when he was putting the jewely in I thought that was the needle lol. When he was putting in the needle it was like a little pinch that lasted maybe 3 seconds. But over all great people and great vide the shop has<//Text>

Washed here many times. The place is great. I love the big washers could  get alot done at once. The new attendent was very helpful. He helped bring my stuff in cause I was struggling. He was friendly and the place was very clean.<//Review>

The man working decided to clean the lint traps on the big dryers which we go there to use which I assume they should be done in the morning or when they close. We go there to use the big washers and we go there to use the big dryers so we can use them. Very dissatisfied</text>

The owners were very appropriate concerning the issues of two or three of their machines. They did refund us promptly when they arrived. Please try to keep the washers clean if you do happen to read this review period and everything should work properly for you.< /Text>< Pics>

I appreciate that they moved their business outside and are wearing masks but it was uncomfortable to have my legs on a non-secured  piece of furniture. After the pedicure my knees hurt so bad from trying to keep my legs straight and to not push furniture too much. It definitely wasn't relaxing. My pedicurist also wasn't very friendly to me and even ignored me at times. My nails do look good but I have to remove some stars for the discomfort and customer service.<//review>

I've been here about 3 times now and enjoyed my experience each time. They were able to take in my best friend and I 30 minutes before closing. They did a really good job and I'm quite happy with my manicure and pedicure.< /Text>

I’m from out of town and I’ve never been to such an unprofessional nail salon in my life. Michael did my nails and was on his phone literally the ENTIRE TIME. He was running out to his truck to do god knows what. The gel polish I picked out was not the color I ended up with. I didn’t say anything at that point because I just wanted to get out of there. I would NEVER recommend this place to anybody.< /Review>

I am hesitant to even give this place one star. The only reason I am giving them one star is because I did used to this place. I have been coming here to get my gel nails done on my natural nails. Yesterday I went in to get the gel removed and have a regular manicure. I asked the lady to not drill my natural nail as it hurts and causes them to thin. She was very rude and told me "If no drill you go home and remove yourself" So unprofessional I am paying to get a service done and they have removed my gel without a drill there plenty of times!  I got up to leave then they started talking in their language one of the guys told me to sit down he didn't seem to happy about it. My manicure was awful I kept asking him to fix my nails as they weren't shaped correctly nor did they file them correctly. When he applied my polish it was so sloppy I could have done a better job at home! A waist of money and my time never going there again! They don't listen to what you want and were very rude!< /review>

I would have rather them told us to come back.  For one of our pedicures the person walked away before painting my sister's toenails and didn't come back for 10 minutes. They also no longer accept cards on Saturdays and Sundays and scoffed at the tip that we left which was more than generous.< /text>< pictures>

Every thing going well, but noticed my pedicure was rushed as soon as someone else walked in . I did not recieve leg massage or hot towel treatment. I also memtioned to her that my "heels were rough and scratcy", she became annoyed became loud in her language and rushed with a small electric file.
So, I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.< /text>

< review>
Was a relaxing experience at the beginning of my Pedicure.
Then the owner started walking back and forth in front of the customers. Rubbing his stomach under his shirt.
Then he started talking Very Loud about something on his Cellphone .
All the employees started laughing. Then yelling back and forth to each other, in their language.
I thought to myself this is a Spa, soft music, low voices, relaxing massage chairs.
Made me very nervous, was ready to get out of that place.
Employees stopped work on customers to read what was on his Cellphone.
That was the third time I have been to this establishment.
The first two visits, was very nice.
Don't know if I will return for the 4th time.<//review>

<Text>It wasn’t the worst place ever but the customer service is non existent. I went in for a full set and when I told him what shape , he barely listened to me. The whole experience was frustrating and painful. Acrylic glue on my fingers and it was so painful when he was taking it off. My nails are not even at all. And the nail polish was not on my entire nail. When I mentioned that something looked crooked , all he said was “ I’ve been doing this a long time”  I just need to find a place that acts like they want the business. Too bad. I was hopeful.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>i have been here several times and the owner does my acrylics, and I have pedicures done by a lovely woman.  I have been very happy with the work.  Not the least expensive place in town, but in my experience "you get what you pay for" applies here.  Treat yourself - you will be glad you did.<//Review>< Pics>

I had a horrible experience. I will never go back!!! The owner was rude and the lady who did my nails would not let me explain what I wanted. She charged me 50 dollars and I left there with a set of nails I have to go pay someone else to fix!!  Everyone I tried to look at them and try to tell her they were too long and not the shape I wanted she kept shushing me and telling me to relax. I walked out with nails that look like press on. Never again.</text>

< Review>
Terrible experience. Told them what I wanted and received the complete opposite. Then I got blamed for not getting dip powder and a full fresh new set . They talked about it the whole time. I would go there religiously every 2 weeks and once a month for a pedi and my daughter would get the same  . My favorite nail person has been gone for 2 months ..... maybe she quit due to the owner being rude . I’ve never been degraded while paying someone my hard earned money. Well my $300+ will go elsewhere.</Review>

<Text>Never go here! Made an appointment for myself and my Mom and asked on the phone about a gift certificate which was 2 months "expired" and was told by the man on the phone to come in. We showed up for the appointment and sat there for over 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. When I asked about the gift certificate the girl took it to Michael then she came back and told me he said, "No." This place is a scam and gift certificates which someone pays money for should not expire! I will never go there or refer it to my friends ever! This is terrible customer service!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Awesomeness! This is the best place in town where I have gotten a pedicure.  I have tried other places, bur they were not done as neatly as at Michaels or have lasted as long. I have only made an appointment once, but didn't need to.  All the other times I have just walked on and got taken in immediately.< /Review>

Really frustrated with the service and pricing. My mother and I came in for my birthday for a mani pedi with full set and got charged $160 before tip. I called around after I left and got priced $52 a piece for the same thing. I got over charged an extra $50 and asked her 3 times about being over charged. I left being over charged because she wasn't understanding what I was saying. Any ways Over priced and unreasonable.
Ps also had to ask 3 times to please fix my pinky because there was a hair in the acrylic. And she said "it was probably in my nail" 🐒funny my nails never grow hair before🤣😂< /Text>

My pedi is horible..cuts on my foot nails still dirty!! Didn't notice til I got home. Gel fill..even worse..not done with gel..done with acrylic then gel polish. They are sloppy looking and just bad ALL THEY WAY AROUND! Nice looking shop..uneducated employees. They should take some lessons from Serenity Nails in Mira Mesa CA. I should have just waited until the end of the month when I am in San Diego again. They'll fix it. Very disappointed.</Text>

<username>Koree Rush</username><text>I was not pleased with my experience here. Michael, the owner did my acrylic nails, I started off by showing him a picture of the nail shape that I wanted (which was very basic, just rectangle shape) he responded with “that will be extra pay, its more work” which I thought was ridiculous. He was looking on his phone all throughout the appt, and my nails didnt even come out close to what I showed him, he got the acrylic all over my hands and my nails are very scratchy and uneven. Will not be going there again.</text>< Rating>

<review>Worse manicure ever.  Pulled and tore cuticle skin.  Nails uneven.  Charged full price even though I did not have nail polish done (I had no confidence she could do a decentry french manicure).  I am now at another nail salon having nails redone.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>if I could give negative star I would. So many better places than this. The lady who did my nails was not paying attention at all. She kept leaving to talk to her coworkers in thr middle of the shellac removal. The shellac removal took almost 30 minutes and that was actually fast for her because the other lady saw how frustrated I was and came over to help withthr removal. She didn't even apologize. When I went to pay. I had change with my payment. The lady kept my change and was saying "tip for her" "tip for her" it was $5 dollars. I just walked out so a scene wasnt caused. I was very upset bc they purposely shafted me with the tip.<//text>< response>

The lady who did my pedicure yesterday was a complete jerk and somehow went through the motions of a pedicure without actually doing it. I’m guessing I upset her somehow but we only spoke a few words. It was my first and last visit as a local.< /text>

Review of an online purchase:

Editing to add: this purchase finally arrived at our house over a month later. Adding back a star.

Made an $80+ purchase back on 8/20 and never received it...reached out to the live chat about why it hadn't arrived...shocked to find out that they just weren't going to ship my order ever due to a glitch from Hurricane Laura. I understand that happens, but they also stated this happened to a lot of orders (too many to reach out to)...seems wrong! If you haven't received an order, I would definitely reach out as to why!!</text>

<review>Great experience every time I’m there!  One specific associate by the name of Jean/Gene solidified my thoughts about this Westfield location.  She introduced the customized patch option I never knew existed till the day we met.  This last visit she offered the $5 bag promotion that I gladly added to my sale.  Great customer service comes from individuals who care about the experience and the positive perception behind the brand.  You can find her in the Men’s department!!  -Core< /review>< rate>

I love the jeans AEO makes they fit me perfect no matter what the cut.

Cons:
Customer service here can be a mixed bag depending on who helps you.  They don't have all sizes, and many items are "Online Exclusives" so many times the store doesn't feel like it has much in terms of selection.<//Review></record>
</dataset><record>
<pics>None</pics><text>I had an amazing experience shopping at the AEO store in Westfield, all the employees were more than willing to help me out and made my shopping experience very pleasant and personal. While I was there I'd say I had about five people help me whether to find my size product in the back, climb a ladder to get my size from the top shelf, show me the clearance section to maximize my shopping, and so much more. I was also surprised when the people helping me, or employees I passed by asked for my name for reference later, all in all amazing service and knowledgable staff.< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

Super friendly staff members who will seriously bend over backwards to help you find what you're looking for.  The only thing about this store is there's a very small clearance selection. Sometimes it's hard to find a shirt that you saw last week. When I asked a staff member where the shirt went, they told me it had to elave the store until they could put that specific set out on display. They just need more space< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Good and varied selection, not only for young people. We as parents also found what we were looking for and are also very satisfied with the quality of the clothing. The staff was very attentive, friendly but not pushy. Would buy there again!

I highly recommend Buddy's Towing. A great experience from start to finish. We were in a bit of a pickle with our 40' 5th wheel, 200+ miles from home in an area with no cell service and they went above and beyond. Ivy in the office was wonderful in assuring they would be able to help us, Josh was fantastic in coordinating the tow, and the owner, Rick, who actually showed up to do the tow, was awesome and one of the nicest people I've ever met. If you are in the Eureka area and need a tow service, I definitely suggest you call Buddy's towing!< /Review>

<text>Highway robbery. Thats all I can say. The worker totally lied outright and tried to say it took them a while before they found a truck that could tow my car. Not true. The very first truck that showed up towed it. And again he tried to say that my car had to be lifted up and lifted off the flat bed. Not true. I watched him drive it onto the flatbed. Then he charged us over 500$ even tho it was only towed about 6 miles and he had it less than 24hrs. These guys are professional con artists. Steer clear if possible.</text>< Pictures>

They were so very responsive, kind, caring, professional and above-and-beyond in providing towing service, when we were very at-risk, by the side of Highway 101, during rush time by Eureka.  We cannot thank them enough.</text>

Called AAA to get my car towed today and within 5 minutes Ty from buddy’s was calling me to let me know he was only about 10 minutes away. And 5 minutes later he was at my house! He was very professional, nice and fast. He got my car taken to the dealership in no time. I would recommend these guys anytime. Definitely will be a returning customer.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Text>In an accident and told CHP officer I have AAA, they called Buddy's and when they showed up I produced my AAA card, but the driver said he didn't need it.  They towed my car .5 miles to their "yard."  I called about an hour later and learned they were charging me $55 per day to "store" my car at their yard.  I immediately called AAA to have my car towed to an auto body shop that wouldn't charge me $55 per day.  Guess who got the call?  Yep, Buddy's.  I then got a ride to Buddy's where they told me the .5 mile was going to cost me $335 plus the $55 for an hour at the yard, so total bill was $390.  I complained and these predators offered to take tittle to my car (it was probably totalled) and they would waive the $55 for an hour of storage.  I was a little off after the accident and they and the CHP took advantage of it.  Never trust the CHP officer to call a real towing company with reasonable charges.  They will instead call someone like Buddy's, who will prey on your misfortune.  Buddy's is the worst!!!!!  Never ever use them for anything.  I am filing a complaint with the CHP and AAA to encourage them to stop using Buddy's!</Text>< gmapID>

My service already gave me an ETA, but Joshua from Buddy's called me immediately to verify the location, ensure that I was safely off the highway shoulder I'd parked my car on, and asked if I could meet him to get the keys.  I live 10 minutes away from where my car is and Joshua offered to come by my house to get the keys so I could go home.  He assured me that he knew where it was getting towed and that it was taken care of, and went out of his way to make me feel safe and comfortable.  He texted me once he retrieved my vehicle and was available for any questions or concerns.  Extremely professional, excellent service.< /Review><user_name>Rebecca Lawrence</user_name><GmapID>0x54d15700d6d49a27:0xef211ab749236af7< /GmapID>< user_id>

Moving a very heavy classic car required expertise.  This a 5000 lb. very long car which necessitated special anchoring of the under carriage.  Jim did a masterful job.  Could not have asked for a better experience.</Text>

However, TY the tech immediately had an attitude. I explained I had cash in car but also wanted to call my roadside assistance. I am homeless and pregnant, but was not trying to get anything for free. He could of let me call the insurance. As soon as my car was unlocked he took off to his truck with my keys without saying anything. Obviously worried I would take off which was impossible as he blocoed me in upon arriving to help. He also could barely read vin and was impatient when I was trying to read the information to him.<//Text><GmapID>0x54d15700d6d49a27:0xef211ab749236af7</GmapID>< Response>

I am still waiting on Buddy's for a tow. My insurance company called and informed them I had locked my keys in vehicle. After waiting 45 minutes my insurance company called me to inform me that Buddy's had come to my son's house and called me too. LIARS!!! I will be talking to them in person.  We are having a chat. They never showed. Why did they have to lie? My insurance company called another company.< /Review>

<review>Horrible horrible horrible company. Our RV broke down on the side of the road. This company didn’t get there for 7 hours. Once they got there they said they didn’t want to tow our vehicle north, only south because north was out of the way for them. Total waste of time.

I can only assume that this is why the driver didn't care if I complained about his behavior. The buddy system.< /Text><Time>1557238873963</Time><gmapID>0x54d15700d6d49a27:0xef211ab749236af7<//gmapID>< user_name>

Great experience. We locked our keys in our vehicle on vacation. Roadside assistance sent a different company to assist us at first. The guy was unable to help us. After almost an hour of no success...he cancelled the job. He called and requested someone else be sent. Buddy towing was sent out. We were told 45 minutes. They arrived in 20. The guy who helped us had us in our vehicle and good to go in about ten minutes. The best part was that he didn't make me feel like I was inconveniencing him. He was professional and pleasant. Thank you for turning a stressful situation into a job well done.< /review>

Wonderful service! I had my car die in the Mill Creek cinema parking lot and AAA told me it would be about 55 min but Jim showed up about 8 min later ! He was able to jump my car, make me laugh with a joke and recommend I get it tested soon. So I called AAA the next day and asked if someone could come out to my work and test it. Funny enough there was a misunderstanding on what was needed so they sent out Jim again for a jump. Even though he was basically called out for no reason he was so nice about it and even called the dispatcher for me to get the correct  services I needed. 10/10 will use again !<//Review>

<Text>I really don't care for this place right now. My kids car was towed here and they won't let her have her things out of it. I have called and called and called, and no one will help me. I asked today what the price of the lien is on her car and was told they had to figure out the fees, and what they wanted to charge on it. So they are going to make money off my daughters towed car. Lovely.
My kids a veteran and they are not giving her her cards, computer, and other personal belongings. So upsetting as a mother. What has the world come too.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

My RV broke down on April 1, 2016on Hwy 101 near Scotia, Ca. and I was stranded on the side of the road. Buddy's sent their guy, Shawn, out to rescue me. He was quite professional and skilled at preparing my Winnebago for towing. He was also very cordial able to lift my spirits in a time  of helplessness. I would personally like to thank Shawn for going the extra mile!</text>

I have used Buddy's Auto Center for several of my tows (unfortunately). Each time, I was given a follow up call by the sweetest woman in their office letting me know their ETA. They are timely, and ALWAYS friendly and helpful. I always get treated nicely, and with a full explanation of what they are doing and why. They don't even make me feel dumb if it is a silly/stupid mistake. I really appreciate their service and all that they do for the Arcata area! If you need a tow or any similar car service - make them your FIRST call! You won't regret it :)</review>

Whoever is in charge of this listing, make sure you are searchable when somebody enters "towing" in Google Maps!  I only found these guys as a referral from someones else that popped up here and they were busy.  I called Buddy's and the connection was all messed up and got dropped, luckily the tow truck was right in front of my face - no, really I got stuck at a gas station and he was helping somebody else out right next to me. He dropped me off at the closest mechanic in a couple of minutes.< /text>

<review>The facility was well maintained. My instructor was very professional. Purchased the pro package, totally worth it. The video and pictures were great quality and great shots! Love my whole experience. Definitely recommend. There was a weather delay but I don't mind any delay if it's due to safety.</review><resp>{'time': 1620697820788, 'text': 'Hi Monserratee, thank you for your 5-star review.

<Text>It was an AWESOME experience! I love it. We did have to wait a while, but that was due to weather conditions. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Overall loved the staff especially Jennifer she’s awesome! My instructor David Minnis is awesome  and Sarah behind the camera is awesome . Amazing footage! Would definitely do it again.</Text>< user>

Had my very first jump ever today! Overall was an amazing experience! Brian was my tandem expert, he made jokes and helped me ease out my nerves. He was incredibly knowledgeable and made me feel safe. He set the bar incredibly high for my future tandems.
I was not particularly fond of one of the staff, I believe her name was Kelsey or something similar. She was the one setting up the jumps. She came off with an unfriendly and stressful demeanor and kind of gave me anxiety, didn't seem welcoming. I also noticed how she yelled at people and seemed to get easily irritable. But maybe she was just having a bad day. Other than her, everyone was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and personable- from staff to instructors, to the entire community of regulars.
Definitely want to jump again.< /text>

I was debating between this and the one in Perris but just from the phone convo with customer service I knew this  would be my ideal place for first time. So booking was very easy over the website. We were running late due to traffic and they were super understanding. Yes the wait was about 3 hours but honestly they tell you the wait will be 2-4. So just come prepared! It’s worth it. They were so nice and talked me through the whole thing. Best experience ever! I plan to go again and again!</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Really great experience, and amazing vibes all around. The on site food truck that was there today I believe is always there. And the burrito I ordered was not only massive but was amazing.
I might would go back just for the burrito but I can rarely pass up on a good jumping experience with a very welcoming community of jumpers.</text>

I will never forget right before I jumped, I looked back at the guy behind me and eyes had rolled up into his head. They had a contest for whoever yelled the loudest would win a case of beer. My roommate and I were on his motorcycle and he won the beer and it was interesting traveling with the case of beer<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1617065116506, 'text': "Hi Adam, yes, we do have a crazy bunch of skydivers who work here :).\nI'm so glad you had a memorable experience.

If it's your first time bring cash if you'd like to tip your instructor and cameraman.
Eat a little bit of something before you jump to help keep you energized.
Bring Gatorade or something similar for after.
Most important.  Have fun! It's a great experience!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

So I was driving home with my family and we saw a beam of light...we followed it to Skydive Elsinore and ended up seeing a low-key, really cool skydive show which I think was sponsored by Red Bull.  The sky divers were dropped by a plane and then had some rockets to launch themselves around in the sky for a bit, before squirreling down with a small chute.  Um whoa!</Text>

All I can say is AWESOME!! The instructors are the greatest. Plus all the fellow jumpers were so very cordial and supportive. Also I want to mention I made this one jump to honor all veterans and current military members, especially my old outfit the 82nd Airborne Division.</Review>

Shout out and much love to G for capturing these memories and my instructor Christian Bicker for an amazing experience, flawlessly backflipping us off the plane & the most graceful landing! 🤩🪂 Even tho I’ve skydived before, Christian still went over proper skydiving form with me- which I appreciated! Christian made me feel safe by constantly making sure my harness was secure while we were on the ground and while he was attaching/tightening our harnesses together in the plane. Glad I was partnered with an awesome team to talk to during my Skydive Elsinore experience!

Skydive Elsinore made the booking & paperwork easy and efficient online, with only a few more papers to sign when you get there- thanks to Shauna for giving my friends and I all the information we needed!

My friends and I booked for the 12:30pm slot, but next time we’ll book for an earlier slot to be mindful of the heat. I wore shorts just barely long enough for the harness to not rub against my skin thankfully.

Thanks again Skydive Elsinore, we’ll be back!<//text>

I was sceptical at first. Took a couple hours from check in to take off. Even after the check in process. Got a little stir crazy but as soon as my buddy and I were met by our tandem instructors it was worth it. My buddy was strapped to Dillain (sorry if i mispelt your name) and i was with Luis. He appeared to be about my age if not a year or two younger. Both dudes went above and beyond in terms of making sure we were comfortable but also giving us a 100% experience. I wanted to to flip at least once and luis basically read my mind and asked if I was ok with doing a flip. After that he was extremely accommodating to making sure i was having fun. After we landed he even said to me "thanks for the skydive" like I was the one pulling his chute. Overall amazing time. Even considering doing my first solo dive at this place to get certified. They're not lying. Its addicting</Text>

For my first tandem I asked Adrian (the guy I was strapped to) to do something crazy. He gave me such a wonderful experience, I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about giving this a try. The jumpers are very experienced, knowledgeable, and willing to work with your needs (such as do something crazy). Adrian, thank you for an amazing jump.</Review>

<review>My only con - that I can't give more than 5 stars.
Sarah ad Seth were AMAZING tandem instructors.  My wife and i went for our anniversary and we're SO GLAD we did.
Communication was clear, the instructors were safe, professional, fun, and reassuring.    My wife and I are already talking about jumping again.
We questioned the photo/video hand-cam package and it was 100% worth it.  The photos are incredible, the video is incredible - and the video is nicely produced, not just rough shots.< /review><GmapID>0x80dc9b0de03f4dc3:0x5ffe018cfc0e8559<//GmapID>< date>

What an amazing experience from start to finish. The entire place has a really great vibe. Lots of space to bring friends and family. It’s a whole experience. Parking is easy and the facilities are very clean. If it’s your first time jumping, choose Elsinore skydiving. You won’t regret it.</Review>

Skydive Elsinore gave me a great experience on my first skydive. Andy was super cool instructor who made it easy the whole way through from getting strapped in to landing. The office staff was friendly and informative, I did have a lot of questions and they were patient with me. Everyone was accommodating and I had a great time. I will definitely be back, and I think I will try a solo jump! I can't wait!</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Girls in the front are not really friendly . I was over charged and I’ve called twice asking about my refund. They claim the manager has to do it. I don’t think I’m getting the refund, so make sure you check your total. Now the experience, it was my first time jumping and I was so excited. I know they have jumped hundreds of times but they can at least pretend to be excited for the sake of customer service. They were just super quiet which made me even more nervous. Needless to say I won’t be going back.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

< Review>
Absolutely enjoyed my tandem skydive here, very reasonable price with excellent support of the tandem trainer (Bee) . The place is pretty neat n you can spend an entire day just watching colourful chutes coming down in style. Parking is available but again limited space, but you can always park a little farther. They give a certificate as well. Also the photos were sent to your email on the same day itself, very prompt indeed. I would revisit very soon. Keep up the good work guys!</Review>

<Text>I signed up for Skydive Elsinore's "Accelerated Freefall Level 1" in part because I'm terrified of heights, and in part because my friend was and I didn't want him to go alone.  (AFF means you jump with an instructor on either side, but you are jumping yourself, controlling yourself, and land your own parachute, vs a tandem jump where the instructor is strapped to you and can handle any aspects of the jump you don't want to)

The campus is cool.  There's definitely a "bro" vibe, but it's not overpowering. Everyone is super friendly and excited.  Everyone is willing to answer questions and wants to help, from instructors to random jumpers.

Once you get into classroom, the facility gets very professional and it reminded me of a more intimate, more friendly Army classroom.

The instructors were patient and detail oriented.  We drilled a LOT on the ground, including how to handle every conceivable type of emergency, with a lot of visual aids and exercises which left me confident I could get safely to ground no matter what happened. We even practiced exit procedures from what I think may have been the real tail sections of decommissioned planes.

The aircraft I went up in felt very new (and even had modern avionics, which I was not expecting at all)

In the air, even though I had poor body position the instructors kept me on track and were re-assuring, friendly, supportive and professional.

The landing pattern which seemed scary and narrow when I was on the ground looking at maps was super easy to navigate from the air and landing, just like all the in-air exercises were very easy because the instructors had taken their time to drill the process over and over on the ground.

I can not think of a single complaint. I am over the moon happy with Skydive Elsinore and give them an unqualified recommendation.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnxzBEk5dnvZc3U7m7YK2BSA_K22b01ucVQXca=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>I had a good experience at this facility, better than others I’ve visited. I would say on weekends like anywhere it’s more crowded and the staff felt more overwhelmed and short fused. Staff on the floor were great. My personal jumpers were fantastic. A big thank you to Tony and Luis.<//Review>< pics>

I did the AFF Level 1 jump for my 60th birthday and everyone I came in contact with from the initial set up to the final jump were extremely helpful and professional. I came in contact with 4 different instructors between my class and my jump and they all gave me a level of confidence and comfort. There were 4 other jumpers in my group who did tandem and everyone we came in contact with from check in staff, instructors, photographers, pilots were all very friendly and made you feel part of their family. Awesome experience. Thank you Skydive Elsinore!<//review><rate>5< /rate><time>1601414935153< /time><gmap_id>0x80dc9b0de03f4dc3:0x5ffe018cfc0e8559<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Overall I had a nice experience here with my husband. The wait time was 2.5 hours after check in for us which I understood cause we did show up 30 minutes late. I believe we were the last jumpers, so am pretty sure our trainers weren't as enthused as they first started out. If your a first time jumper ofcourse your nerves are gonna be through the roof 😳 but I tried to act calm as possible. My camera girl was awesome. She kept the same energy throughout even tho I was nervous. My husband jumped with Bee if I'm not mistaken...He said she was awesome and made him feel comfortable which is very important. Now for some tips... cause they don't seem to give much of that. Take earbuds, I came down with an earache. For my girls with weaves, wrap it up, braid it, or get you a special hair band hun. Take your earings out, I lost my 500 bucks gold earring for being dumb...so take it all off sis. Wear a sweater, comfortable bra and some tights. Expect for your groin to be sore after lol. Take a snack and your headphones just in case you gotta wait hours...and that's about it. The rest of advice they give is on point. Remember you'll be fine. 🤘🏾< /Text><rating>4</rating>< UserId.>

Elsinore is a great place visually and I thought the pricing was just right too. When I got there, the staff and the friendly instructors there made me feel extremely comfortable. For anyone who's thinking of doing a Tandem jump here, I can assure you that it's worth it. The instructors here jump like 15-20 times a day, and are alive n fit! So you can be sure that they know what they are doing, their equipment doesn't fail, and they will try their best to ensure that it goes well for you. I bought the Pro package which ensured that a recording instructor flies with me. The recording instructors also do a fantastic job. They cover the whole thing as a story. So you have a full story at the end, and can re-live the moments later. I had a problem loading my video later, but they sorted me out in no time. My friend who jumped with me also had a great experience. All in all, this is a fantastic place for any experience - be it your first jump or the 200th! Well done team!</Text>< user_name>

I celebrated my 30th birthday with a tandem jump at Skydive Elsinore! Kyle was my instructor and Dalten took the outside video/pictures. They are incredible people with the coolest jobs. I love the pictures and video and was surprised with a certificate and t-shirt. The dropzone is huge with a welcoming environment. Also loved that my husband and kids were able to hangout to watch me take off and land. Now I'm hooked and can't wait to return for the AFF course!< /Review>

Just did a jump yesterday and it was scary at first but dont be scarred, the best things in life are things thay come after fear and that is what I did. Let me tell you when I was on that plane about to fall I was terrified. But once those 5 seconds of fear was over It was a blissful experience. I loved doing it and I will 100 percent do it again.< /Review>

<review>Skydiving was probably one of the BEST things i've ever done in my entire life! I came here to celebrate my friends 21st birthday and after two weeks of contemplating this once in a lifetime opportunity to skydive I probably would have never thought of actually going haha!!. It was a group of us and our appointment was set at 11 A.M. however, the sky was very cloudy that day so therefore we had to wait a couple of hours to see if the clouds would clear up. I was very optimistic that we were gonna skydive that day ! Shout out to the guy we met there named Stake! He gave us a tour around the grounds (only because it was very cloudy and it was a high chance that we weren't going to be able to skydive due to weather). He showed us the airplanes and just told us what to expect when we were going to jump hahaha! After a couple hours of waiting the sun began to come out and the clouds started to clear up and it was showtime !! Justin (super funny dude) was my skydive instructor and I cannot thank him enough for making my first skydive experience so much fun! He kept ensuring me that everything was gonna go smooth and he was very knowledgeable about skydiving and he told me everything I have to do to make this go well. Honestly I wasn't as nervous as I was days before but I was just so ready to experience this thrill! Justin made sure that I was secure and as soon as we were getting ready to get on the plane, he told me that we were going first haha. Skydiving is not as scary as people might think it is, however the experience is probably different for every person but thanks to all the friendly and professional staff for making this experience memorable I will definitely come back with my family !!  Thank you so much Beth (I think that is her name), Justin, the camera guy (I forgot his name lol)  and Stake for making this experience so AMAZING!!< /review>< date>

Great experience! I went with a friend for our first tandem skydive experience. I was surprised by how easy the whole process was. The reception staff are indeed (as other reviewers posted) very friendly and welcoming while also being very professional in making sure you understand everything. Then it was all easy. We got to meet our skydiving pros. They didn't do much explaining, I guess because there wasn't much needed. Both very friendly and talkative. The place has an interesting hippie vibe.<//review>

I decided to do this because my mental state has been on a steady decline in the last year. So when I was asked, I jumped at the chance to face my fear of heights and maybe do something exciting to hopefully bring my mood up. Had a complete blast. The experience was pure adrenaline and Bliss. 100% recommend</Review>

<date>1581918296042<//date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I was jumping at Skydive Elsinore in November/December..
It's an increíble cozy DZ with a huge landing area and a fantastic view. The bunk beds are comfy and the staff is just fantastic..

I ended up forgetting my altimeter, went back home (Germany) thinking I will never see it ever again.. I got in touch with the DZ and Daniella (manifest) was going so much out of her way to get that alti back to me.. Shes arranged the drop of at the manifest, the packaging, went to the post office and constantly informed me about her next steps.. This is literally pure selflessness. We don't even know each other in person and I am more than grateful to have had her taken all my fear and can now say l that I've finally got it back..! She has even put some goodies into the package. Skydive Elsinore has in general very special vibes around and these amazing staffs are just the cherry on top. Please hold onto these kind people working at your manifest. They really make the differences to other DZs around. I will for sure recommend this DZ to anybody and we will see each other in one year again!! Thank you with all my heart!!!!! ❤️< /Text>< Pics>

It's quite a popular place for jumpers, alot of solo jumpers. If your trying to do a tandem jump, go early morning the wait time is close to 2hrs, towards the end of the day the wait time exceeds 4 hrs. Overall you will have a wonderful experience.</Review>

My friend Annie gave me this tandem jump experience with Skydive Elsinore as a birthday gift. My jump was on Saturday, July 7,2018. It was my first time. I had a blast!!! One of the best experiences. My instructor, Matt (AKA Fred) was excellent. He made this first jump both instructional and relaxing. The whole crew at Skydive Elsinore was very friendly and encouraging to newbies to the experience. I would recommend this outfit to anyone and everyone that is planning their first skydive adventure. Thanks again Skydive Elsinore. Jackie W.<//Review>

I used to skydive in the 80s & 90s, we took my son for a tandem jump for his 18th birthday and we had a blast.  The instructors are awesome, all top notch professionals with many years of experience.

I think everyone should jump once, maybe 2 times because you only get 50-60 seconds of free fall time.  Skydiving is one of the safest sports out there with 1 death per 1,000,000 jumps.  There aren't many sports with that safety record except maybe checkers.

Do it once, you'll never regret it.</Text>

Best drop zone I've ever jumped at!  It has the friendly, home-style feel of a small drop zone, but with the experience and equipment of a larger drop zone.  I've been to a number of drop zones in the Southern California area and I recommend Skydive Elsinore hands down. Highly recommend for tandem jumps.  Part of the experience is the friendly atmosphere, so its a great place to bring a first time tandem jumper.  Got my A license at this drop zone. Best experience ever!< /text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>This is a great fun jumper DZ. There is a welcoming, helpful atmosphere and the DZ turns plenty of loads. My only complaint is the desert landing area for those with less than 200 jumps. It's full of gravel and other small plants, and is on very uneven ground. It would be awesome if there was more grass for those with less than 200 jumps, or if that landing area was opened up to those with 100+ jumps like Eloy, Perris, etc.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>My good friend ( melissa ) and I went sky diving yesterday (07/20/19) for the first time ever! The experience  was amaze the staff was so personable and full of personality which made for an even better experience.  My instructor  Fred Macarter rocked! I was so anxious , nervous and excited at the same time he helped ease that anxiety.  My friend and I both purchased the upgraded package for pictures and video  ( which I highly recommend)to capture the moment  up high. Christopher Arnold was my friend photographer  and he did great he captured great photos and every angle that you would want as diver. Lots of photos and group photos of us on the plane and pictures and video of her landing and short recap of how she felt once landing. Unfortunately my didnt capture as many photos  nor did he capture my landing  with picture or video. bummer.  But fortunately. I could see a little glimpse of my landing from my friends video since I landed right after her.

Skydive Elsinore is the place to do it. If you're going to do it ... do it! It's well worth it</Review>< Pics>

Great first time everyone was friendly yet professional. I really appreciated tandem jumper Joe, made the experience comfortable and fun. I wasn't scared or second guessing at all but i got the feeling if i was joe woulda been the dude to get me to go through with it. 2 things they dont tell you worth noting, first a minor pounding pain in your head till your ears are able to pop and even then it takes about 15 mins to hear normally. Second the immense pressure on the upper thigh area once the shoot deploys, homie his best to help adjust but it would have needed to be done differently from the get go. Overall those little things are minor inconveniences when you realize you just jumped out of a plane. I would absolutely go again with the main goal of being able to jump without being attached to someone.</review>

The best skydiving school in the inland empire several planes give them the lift to handle a good size group. Experienced professionals thato you can have confidence. Nice private field with minimal traffic, large flat landing zone. The offer a complete line of skydiving products and services. This is the best place to start your parachute adventure.</Text>

This was my first time skydiving. I'd heard before that skydiving is a "hurry up and wait" kind of experience, so I was prepared for it. I made my appointment for 11/2 at 9 am, but I showed up at 8:30. (It's just always better to have the extra cushion of time.) What you need to understand first off is that your safety is in their hands, and they have a lot of factors to contend with - wind/weather conditions, properly securing the equipment, seeing to every jumper, and yes, the paperwork, because if you haven't heard, Americans are kind of litigious, and they have to cover their bases. So you likely won't be going up right on time. I, myself didn't get geared up until closer to 10, but hey, if that's the cost of me safely landing from a 12,500 foot drop, then that's fine by me!
I was lucky to get Marcelo as my instructor - he immediately made me feel right at ease with everything. He was very friendly, personable, and positive. Even with the plane at the full altitude, I wasn't anxious like I thought I would be. And the jump? Well, you'd just have to try it for yourself to know what it's really like! In Elsinore, you see it all - the desert, the mountains, and the sea. It was an incredible experience, and I will definitely be doing it again. I am so glad I came here for my first jump!<//Review>

This was my first skydiving experience and it was at 13000 Feet. This place is awesome and the instructors are very friendly. I took the tandem and the pro video options. The guys who took the pictures he was below me, so i got the pictures of the whole sky and me, which seems to me the best angle. Absolutely 5 start experience except the wait time was a bit way too long.<//Text>

<Review>If you ever wanted to skydive, learn to skydive, hang out with skydivers, or watch people fall from the sky, this is the place for you. Also note has the friendliest instructors and guests.

The first time I went I had a wonderful time but my DVD that I purchased was scratched. Fast forward 7 years and I go to skydive again. The experience is 5 stars, but the quality of the video I got was so incredibly poor. I was incredibly disappointed because there is no way they can redo it unless I jump again, which, physically, I can't. The guy doing the photography and videotaping had the sun in the background the duration of my jump so you can't even see anything except a speck against the sun. He never got close enough so one would never know who or what even jumped out of the plane, let alone knowing that it's me. I paid extra for the DVD and photos and regardless that the cameraman isn't a professional, he could at least have the knowledge to know that you should be able to SEE the person you are filming. My friend who jumped with me also paid extra and while their video game it great, it took Skydive Elsinore over a week to send it. Claiming that they had sent it when in reality they never did. It's supposed to be received within 48 hours. All in all, at least the most important part, the jump, was perfect.<//text>

It was my Dads 60th so we got him a skydiving trip, my wife and a close family friend all went with him.  The original day we went was too cloudy we had to reschedule , which was a breeze to do with the very friendly and helpful staff. Today we went and the staff was great very social and really pumped it up to make it fun, I have to say that Jared was a shining star and just his energy made me want to sign up, but then I realized I was a chicken. we did the video package everything was great, our good friend had a rough landing where she didn't get her feet up and it looks like she broke her ankle. Again the staff were very good professional and caring but I think they need to improve the communication with the family on when an incident happens, however seldom it may be. The instructors did a great job getting her the care she needed , I hope that the instructor H. doesn't blame himself. the video and pictures are well worth the money because it is such a whirlwind of a trip, its good to look back on.  all in all I would recommend going skydiving her and strongly recommend you practice lifting your legs up before you go!</review>

When I lived in Southern Cal, my primary DZ was Elsinore.I was forced to give up jumping in 1969.
In the near future,it is a good possibility that I will be in your area.It is my number one priority to visit your facility and get back in the swing of things.
Question does my previous experience have any influence or is it a ground zero situation?

Wow!!! A brilliant experience, relaxed but extremely well organised. I did a tandem jump and will do it again when we come back to the States. The video is a must, my family have had hours of fun wondering where all the "flappy" skin came from</text>

Staff is friendly and planes were fast. Lots of fun jumpers (mostly freefly), so finding someone to jump with if you're visiting is pretty easy. Large packing area. Only drawback is the area isn't very scenic, it can be super hot in the summer and the dust devils that spring up in the afternoons whenever it's warm.< /Review>

<Text>Skydive Elsinore provides a very unique experience for those willing to be hurled out of an aircraft and into a freefall. Their staff are well qualified, and know what they are doing.

From a critical perspective, it appears that scheduling could be managed a little better. Our early morning schedule which was purchased in advance was delayed and we, along with other tandem jumpers waited approximately 5 hours before the jump. The wait was not due to weather, or mechanical delays, as group after group went ahead. When inquiring about the status of the assigned jump the typical answer given was "about thirty more minutes" which degraded into uncertainty.

It could be that this situation was rare.

Overall, you'll enjoy the experience, but be prepared to wait just in case it turns into an unexpectedly long day.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Skydive Elsinore is always full of fun and awesome people! Everyone is so inviting and genuinely excited to be there. The drive from to Elsinore is the shortest way to get from DTLA to airplane, and the view from the top has both mountains and ocean, with Catalina in sight on a clear day. Don't miss this 5 star dropzone!<//Review>

<Text>I completed my very first tandem jump today and it was a great experience! It’s been on my bucket list for quite some time, so I decided to take the plunge on my 57th birthday. As a private pilot, I’ve been in and around planes for years, but have never jumped out of one. The staff was a pleasure to work with during the entire process. The atmosphere around the DZ was awesome! My instructor; Rob, was fantastic! He was very thorough and professional. His canopy handling skills were impressive. My videographer and jump camera man; Matt, was also fun, professional, and skillful. I’m hooked! I will definitely return to Skydive Elsinore for another jump in the future. I might even sign up for my AFF course!
Kudos to the Skydive Elsinore team! 😎</Text>< rating>

I love Skydive Elsinore! It's such a friendly dz, helpful staff, good amenities, and great jumping for both experienced and new jumpers.  The views while skydiving are brilliant and good to capture on video.  Lots of coaching available for all levels to build or refine their skills. Kit store, bar, snack bar, bunks and showers on site, think there's rv hook-up available too. We've been coming here since 2001 and this place never disappoints. The staff can cater for solo jumpers or teams and various British teams regularly hold expeds here.</text>

Easy process. Nice people. Lots of fun. I took my son for his 18th birthday. He was not feeling well and we got through the whole process waiting to get on the plane. He wanted to jump do badly I could not convince him to come back another day until his headache was so bad he decided to reschedule. Lake Elsinore Skydiving made it super easy to reschedule.  I just called them up when we were ready a few weeks later and we showed up. The instructors were nice. Only issue is waiting around not knowing how long is going to take to get to from start to finish. They tell you it would be a two to four hour process. That kind of kills your day and any plans. Lots of fun nonetheless. My son had an awesome time. My ears started hurting super bad with the altitude change on the freefall. They're still plugged up. Another young man in the plane said the same thing when we were finishing up. Not sure how to change that or what to recommend for someone else, just know there's a possibility this may occur.</Text>

I made a reservation for 11:00 AM and was told, upon arriving, that this was just an estimate. The paperwork and safety video takes about 20 minutes maybe. I'm okay with all of this, but then we were told to sign in at another desk where we were told we would have to wait about two hours. So, we went for lunch and came back only to learn that our wait had been extended by another hour and a half. I've been skydiving before and never had to wait this long.<//text>

I took my daughter here for her 19th Birthday. Best decision ever. I want to thank the entire office staff, especially "Ashley" for being so welcoming, informative, patient and helpful. My instructor "Itai" was extremely competent, professional, knowledgable and cared about making my experience the BEST! The entire staff, instructors and pilot were of the highest quality. They make the atmosphere so uplifting, positive, and fun. Their amazing playlist of songs was relevant to the whole experience. This experience is priceless. I left there with a profound memory to share with my daughter for the rest of our life. We are definitely going back and I definetely recommend this place to family and friends. Thank you Skydive Elsinore!!!< /Text>

<review>I'm an AFF student and had my first jumps yesterday.

Ground coach: Lindsay
AFF Level 1: Luca & Brodie
AFF Level 2: Luca & Cory

First off the staff are all AMAZING people. Fun, enjoyable, and super professional when it comes to "safety" and training.

I trust my life with these individuals and have complete confidence in their skills and abilities simply because of the fact that they know what the hell they are doing and have the jumps to prove it.

The facility is pretty nice and I really liked the metal work throughout the entire place. There's a stainless steel logo in the office and the welds blew my mind. Clean bathrooms and showers. Nice shaded area to chill.

***ADVICE FOR AFF LEVEL 1 STUDENTS***
PLAN AHEAD ON STAYING 2 DAYS just in case.

Personally, as a student, I think it's better to make a weekend out of it whenever you visit Skydive Elsinore. There's a lot to learn and trying learn anything after a 2 hour commute is daunting.

This isn't like getting a Bachelor's Degree. There's no "pass and forget" so make sure you are fresh and ready soak in the important info and be ready to drill it in! 100% commitment.

In retrospect, I thought it was a more beneficial to the learning process to have the ground class, sleep on it, study, and be rested and alert for the next day.

Lastly, after everything is checked and rechecked, the wind still determines who jumps. The entire facility can be grounded if the weather is bad.

Levels 2-8 do not take that long and neither do the solos. You can easily get multiple jumps completed in 1 day; however, staying that extra day and keeping a track of the weather before you go will maximize your chances of getting your jumps in.

Do not schedule things too far in advance because the weather can change. You have to be flexible.

One thing not listed on their website is that they offer wind tunnel training with a coach. If you are between Levels 3 and 4 it is a great option to explore<//review>< pictures>

<review>The WHOLE staff excluding my instructor was HORRIBLE! Horrendous customer service, very unwelcoming people, extremely unorganized, and very unhelpful in every way.  For one we had an appointment at 1 o clock and I was thinking okay we have an appointment we should be in and out in about 2 hours. Wrong! Appointments literally mean nothing here! It all depends what time you show up and sign in. We as in my sister and I got there before two girls  that were also tandem skydiving for the first time. We had met them in the video room and we checked in BEFORE THEM we were already sitting on the picnic benches as we watched them check in. We talked to them for the entire wait which was 4 and a half hours just to get called up! And they along with a few others who also got there after us took off BEFORE us after bringing this up to the staff multiple times they said there is no way that can possibly happene. They kept repeating that same information. Well guess what man? It happened and we are not happy. We had plans for later in the day. The wait time would have been no big deal if they would have been straight up and said oh it's gonna be 4 hours we have a lot of challenges today. Instead they told us it would be an hour and a half. As we sat there for over four hours there was NO COMMUNICATION about why it was taking so long. It's understandable that skydiving is complicated and a lot can go wrong causing major delays but at least communicate that to us so we can plan accordingly instead of wiltering in 95 degree weather.  So we FINALLY get to skydive which I can say was definitely a huge thrill. I paid the whole 90$ for the video and I'm super excited to watch it and share it with all my friends who are waiting to see it as soon as I get home. Only to find out that it is not on the USB drive  they gave me! Just the pictures and a short 28 second long interview but no video of my actual jump. It was all because my video person decided to go back up for another jump without turning my video in and now I think my video is gone forever. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Ruined my first ever skydive. I just want to give a special shoutout to my instructor Mike who made me feel better about the whole thing and made my actual jump something I won't forget despite all the misfortunes that took place.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1443337794240</Time><username>Bryan Zuniga<//username><Resp>None<//Resp>< UserId.>

My first time i was speechless! The first minute you drop is so intense it feels like your underwater then after they release the parachute, its just so awesome from there. Youve got to experience it yourself!!!</Review>

The manager said my nephew injured just because of the wind issue even if there was a suspicious of the instructior’s tiresome , no motivations , nervousness as I watched the video .
He signed up on the waiver
Which meant he could not claim about it
Other foreigner injured at this place a year ago
The reason was the wind .
My assumption is whoever gets injured there while they are landing
Others will get injured in the future
The reason will be the wind
Specially for the foreigners</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Wow should not be the word at all. the service sucks, the staff so so, the manager don't know what the hell he is doing, runing back and and forth, the important thing to him is how to make an extra buck. Instructors very stuck up, I paid for the AFF which is more expensive than the tandem. I was charged for two camera men, each at $90. they pretended it was an honest mistake. (fine)
It was my 50th birthday, and wanted to celebrated with a big event. went to lake Elsinore sky diving school, I wanted to jump AFF not tandem, spent 6 hours that day on the ground training, untill the instructor said I am ready, and he went to check on the flight, he came back telling me that the they do not send a plane up with just one person. it is not cost effective.
I had to contact over thirty people who wanted to come and see my first jump on my B.day to cancel and ask them if they could come the next morning. Anyway, the next morning we caravaned four cars with about 20 people to lake Elsinore.
I met with a different instructor his name was nick who wanted to give a refresher before my jump, he said thet he is not impressed and he need to talk to the manager about the jump, and they offered me a tandum jump, I refused and asked them to refund me my money. still insisting on doing the tandem jump they sent this instructor nick to ask me as to why I don't want to be jump Tandem, and if being strapped to another person would me feel comfortable then this is not a good frame of mind or reason. Imagine this is coming from a guy who is as old as my son giving me an advice a 50 year old man.
I got my refund without looking at the reciept, later on I found that they took $25.00 deposit out. will see about that!!!! I did not break the contract they did, and they will pay the deposit back anyway. As I was leaving the manager his name I believe is libo I guess, said something stupid " at the end of the day we make the call" hmmmm.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very, very good dz. The prices are reasonable, friendly staff, incredibly beautiful, everything you need is in place)
There is only no arrow for the preselection, which is not usual, since the wind changes me regularly.

Very, very nice drop zone) really nice personal, not so expensive. Very beautiful, especially on a sun set. Very comfortable to skydive)

(Original)
Очень, очень хорошая дз. Цены вменяемые, приветливый персонал, безумно красиво, есть все необходимое на месте)
Нету только стрелки для преземлегия, что не привычно, так как ветер меняет я регулярно.

<review>(Translated by Google) Very fine place. Really fine staff. After a short-term cancellation of a neighboring place, it would help very well. We were able to complete our training.

Thanks to the chief instructor for your kindness.

Mega brilliant dropzone. 😂😂🥰

(Original)
Sehr feiner Platz. Mal richtig feiner Staff. Nach  einer kurzfristigen Absage eines Nachbarplatzes, würde sehr gut geholfen. Wir konnten unsere Ausbildung doch durchführen.

Danke an an den Chef Instruktor, für das Entgegenkommen.

Mega geniale Dropzone. 😂😂🥰< /review>< Date>

(Translated by Google) You can enjoy the beautiful scenery. The pack area is outdoors, so it is sunny. The landing area is divided by license. The adjacent inn is beautiful for the low price. The fan jump is $ 35.
