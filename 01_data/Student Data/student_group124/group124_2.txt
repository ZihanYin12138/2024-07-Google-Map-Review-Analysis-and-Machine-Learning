The Manager Martin was very nice and went out of his way to give me a good price on my storage. I was very pleased how he made me comfortable just not over the phone but in person. I would let others know if they are looking for storage to go to A-American Self-Storage I was pleased. I believe it depends on the Manager who works there .Thank you Martin</Review>< pictures>

This is a welcoming place for those needing a storage. It’s our first time to get a storage and we felt that our stuff will be safe in this place. Robert is a awesome, nice guy, knowledgeable. He toured us around and gave us the storage we want. Did a very good job for us and granted our request.. Thank you Robert. 🙏🏾♥️😇<//text>

I’d like to thank Rob and Martin for all their help. My daughter needed a storage unit as she needed to store some of her stuff from her college dorm room. The facility was clean, and convenient. They were very professional and helped us with whatever we needed. Thanks again guys.<//Text>

<Review>Please be very cautious when you store your belongings and valuables here. My families storage was broken into and they have Zero surveillance footage of the incident, they don't even have footage of the day that we brought our belongings in. Apparently the cameras are just for show. You definitely get what you pay for here. Also if you do please have your own personal insurance because their insurance will not respond and the management will also not return calls. A nightmare I wish we could wake up from.<//Review>< Time>

This was by far the easiest self storage experience I’ve had.  Their level of hospitality was next level. Food, coffee, a tour, and a rate that was so low I actually didn’t think they would stick to it. 10/10 will do again.< /Review>

I don't know how I originally posted a 2 star review on this place. I literally have no idea how that happened. My daughter had to help me figure out how to change it. In no way did I have anything but an exceptional experience. JoAnn is amazing. She goes out of her way to help people, and I absolutely love her. This is the best place to go for storage, HANDS DOWN. Don't go anywhere else!!!!</Review>

I have been a customer of a-american self storage for a few years now and every time I go there Chris is such a wonderful and helpful person and is always upbeat with a positive attitude. I even got locked out of my unit one time and Chris and Martin helped to open it. This place is great I wouldn't choose another place to store my things. Prices are great as well and it was an easy move in. Friendly environment. Thanks again Chris for your great service!!!<//text>

The best customer service I've had in a long time . Martin and the manager was super nice very approachable and very caring ! They have been helpful In everything I needed and currently need . Due to my situation of having to leave my storage so quick without even moving was a concern of mine because i thought they would give me less customer service but instead made me feel at ease with my process thank you for being so professional and quick to answer all my questions and concerns . I will highly recommend going here and getting your belongings stored . I know where I'm going next time I need a place . I will be recommending this place to anyone I know ! Thank you guys for everything I seriously appreciate it!!<//Text>

<resp>{'time': 1487792529786, 'text': 'Hi Tal,\n\nWe take every complaint seriously as we do pride ourselves on our outstanding customer service.  We were able to track down the recording of the phone call you made to the office before you rented.  After carefully reviewing the call we have found that the office staff did offer you the special you currently have.  They did not offer you 3 months for $230.  You were offered a discount of $255 per month for the next 6 months, which is a discount from the normal price of $317 per month.  Perhaps you misunderstood or misremember the phone call.  As we stated previously we take the time to investigate every complaint made.  If you have any additional questions you can call our corporate office at (310) 914-4022 and leave a message.  A supervisor will get back to you as soon as possible.  We do apologize for the misunderstanding.\n\nThank you, Management.'}< /resp>< Rating>

<Text>Never go there again, called and ask for rates the sale person told me"first 3 month $230" when I got there he made the contract and charged me $230 a month.  I have  Ask why he charged me $230 a month and over the phone he said 230 for 3 month? he did not denied what he says but says this is our rates . I already drove all the way here unload into storage and came to pickup documents. I will stay for 1 month and will never come again.....I'm sorry to use this word this is my first time and I hope last to say it But they are liers and has very bad business ethics.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We absolutely love Adobe Animal Hospital for our furry family member's vet care.  Every vet we have seen has been kind and compassionate and took their time explaining things to us.  The staff have always been responsive and kind regarding getting testing, filling rx, and answering any simple questions we may have.</text>

<text>The doctors I have dealt with have been great. The problem I have is miscommunication. With curbside, I had driven off one day planning to call in and pay later, but got busy and totally forgot. This part I fully take responsibility for. However, they never called or emailed me about the bill, but claim that they did. I did receive voicemails about picking up a prescription, however no one EVER mentioned this bill to me. They say they sent me letters, but at the time i was moving and not receiving some of my mail. I never got one email or phone call about my bill and then, they sent me to collections a couple of months later! No warning other than snail mail. The manager had nothing to say, no apology or explanation. I had a history with them of being very reliable with both my animals, always paid on time, and they did not even give me a chance, just assumed I wouldn't pay and sent me to collections. I know for a fact I did not receive an email or a message about it, I always check my messages and emails every day. It makes me feel that their priorities are not my animals. If they had taken my history as a client into consideration, they would have realized that I would absolutely have taken care of this if I had known about it.</text>< GmapID>

<review>Very friendly staff at a very clean facility. You can tell they are all animal people here! Pretty easy to get last minute appointments as needed, I was able to make one for Saturday the day before which I was shocked by. They treat my dog really well and he seems to not mind going there, even when they have to poke him with needles! Probably because they give him all sorts of treats while he’s there too.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo7Ljx6CCuA7575SD5dj_oMxYytYOQSbthhPXh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

They are not helpful when your animal needs help the most. I understand that everyone is busy bc of the current environment we are in, but if your animal needs help this Vet can not be relied on. Maybe they're short staffed bc it seems like someone always isn't in the office working.<//text>

<Text>What a great facility!! Everyone from the front desk person, nurse and vet were all so kind and caring. My cat Jackson needed his teeth checked and he is a nervous boy. They took wonderful care of him, communicated very well with me and sent me home with a comprehensive care plan for the future. Their covid19 policies were simple to follow and made me feel very safe, which I appreciate. Highly recommend!!!! 💜💜💜💜 Extra thanks to nurse Emily for the great care!!!<//Text>< pictures>

My dog and I have tried quite a few different vets in the area looking for the right one. Adobe is by far the winner! They are so good with your fur-baby, responsive, & truly know what they're doing. I found Adobe because my dog needed to have a CCL surgery & they were able to get him in much sooner than the vet we were seeing would be able to & much more affordable without sacrificing any quality in treatment. In fact Adobe has better service than any of the other vets I've been to including Banfield, Petcare East & West, Animal Hospital of Sebastopol & VCA North Park. They have indoor/outdoor (completely fenced in & beautiful) exam areas for dogs that may have a preference. Who does that, who has that much care for the dog's experience at the vet? I've never seen exam rooms like theirs, it's really cool. They have fear free & low stress certified techs & it SHOWS. My dog no longer hates going to the vet. When I take my dog to the vet now, when we pull up to Adobe he gets so excited knowing he's going to the fun place. That to me speaks volumes to my dog's treatment when he's there with them. Adobe truly is the standard of what pet care should be. I cannot rave about Adobe Animal Hospital enough, as long as those doors are open, this is where my dog will go.< /text>

<Text>YES! Bring your loved ones here! They are so friendly and so honest about what kind of treatment is right! They also make appointments so fast! I needed my cat checked up soon and they were able to fit me in within a week! Back at my hometown (Im a college student) getting an appointment would have taken a month in advance. They are very caring, straightforward, and understanding. I will definitely be coming back!<//Text>< pics>

Awesome place. I highly recommend. My 2 dogs and I have been pretty high-maintenance patients lately and Adobe has been so good to us. I never feel like they are rushing through anything even when we were there on an emergency basis, meaning they were squeezing us in so I'm sure we were getting them behind for the rest of the day. We had high expectations for Adobe because we loved our last vet so much but we have not been disappointed! Havent met the owner/veterinarian yet but the other two have been fantastic.  All the support staff are great too. Molly and Dr Kidwell were especially helpful and kind today.< /Review>

< Review>
I  have waited to review Adobe Animal Hospital to see how they handled a couple of problems I have had. I probably started out with a 4 star rating after the first visit, and there are reasons why it has gone down to 2 by the time I write this. On the positive side, the 2 veterinarians I have met are very personable, give good information, and follow up with calls very promptly.
On the negative side, the amount of time waiting for appointments seems excessive, the charges for services are definitely higher than the clinic we came here from, but those still wouldn't have dropped their rating to a 2. What did that was the staff and how they mishandled the charges for part of a procedure. They failed to put a biopsy on the bill I paid, then called me to tell me that we still owed them; still not a problem, I would have paid it when we came in if they had asked when I was in the office. What happened is that as I was driving out of the parking lot an employee came out with the statement. It was raining and I had a dog I could not secure in the car, so I said "Mail it to me and I will send a check." A week went by and nothing came from them, instead I get another phone call saying that "I need to pay this... So today I called before I went in for the appointment to remove sutures and told the person who answered to have that bill ready when I got there so I could take care of it. When I got there, no one knew anything about it, so I finally took the dog in to get the sutures out. This person had the bill, so now I need to take more time on the way out to pay it. When I tried to do that, their credit card machine was not working and the person there said "Give me the card information and we will charge it when we get it working". NOT A SECURE WAY TO DO TRANSACTION!! If there is a manager there, you need to get your act together.<//Review>

Very kind team. Dr was very through and informative. Gave me a treatment plan before any work was done so I knew the cost up front. Very clean and organized office. Great experience for myself, children and most important my senior cat.<//Review>

I’m going to sue  them.they told me all these tests I needed and because I couldn’t afford the I gave her up hopefully for a better life. When I gave her to the shelter they said I didn’t need all those tests so I took her back.
All they care about is money and I’m done with them</Text>

This is a newer veterinary hospital in Petaluma. It serves cats and dogs and has separate areas for them, so cats are less scared.

Dr. Stemwedel is nice and easy to work with in solving your pets problems and needs. My daughter took her cats to a male veterinarian here and said he was very good also.

I've only gone a few times so far, but each time I haven't had to wait long the front desk employees as well as the assistance have been polite and friendly and most importantly good with my pets.
Another credit I would give this veterinarian is that I have never felt rushed. Each time she has given me the time I needed to ask all of my questions and consider all the information she's provided.

They have Royal Canin prescription pet food here as well as a few other supplies, such as vitamins and flea medications.

They are not inexpensive, but I have never found a good vet who was. I always wish it was more affordable to get the care for our pets that they need without breaking the bank, but if they get better when they're sick and healed when they're hurt in a nice facility that is clean and well-kept and well-staffed, I guess it's the best we can do.

They have a private parking lot with easy access to the front door and the hospital is very conveniently located off of a main thoroughfare.<//review>

<Text>We love Dr. Stemwedel and her team! They're caring, knowledgable and professional. They listen, go over all treatment options, and go out of their way to check-in with our dog's recovery after treatments. We've got an athletic, yet accident-prone golden retriever that has spent quite a bit of time in the vet's office. We're so thankful for Adobe Animal Hospital! Excellent care. Poppy thanks you!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Dr. Yvonne Stemwedel is the best veterinarian that I've ever met. I have been bringing my dog to Adobe Animal Hospital since we adopted him 2 years ago. Dr. Stemwedel and her team truly care and it's very apparent.  Their prices are very reasonable and they don't push unnecessary services. I would highly recommend Adobe Animal Hospital if you're looking for a veterinarian in Petaluma.<//text>< Response>

<review>Both of my dogs have been going here for about two years now . My dog was hit by a car and taken to the vca pet hospital in Santa Rosa, she had both hind paws degloved from the accedent. I brought her to Adobe for her bandages to be changed witch are going to be done daily. They tried to charge me for an examination witch is a chumped up charge!!!  Not to mention over 200 .oo dollars just to change the bandages . Over priced and not good with my dogs . I took my other dog in on Halloween and I. Was Charged over 300
For maybe a 30 second examination of my dog .  this place will take your money and don't care about your dog it's obvious cash is King at this vet. By the way I got her bandages changed  at a different place for a fraction of the cost of Adobe! This place doesn't deserve 1 star.< /review>< name>

<Review>I was on the 60 fwy at 6:49, your bus #813 almost created a horrific accident. The driver cut off a white car in the farthest left lane into the carpool lane. If there was cars in that lane or the driver did not notice the bus there would have been a collision of several cars.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) I usually don't post bad reviews! But here we go !!! We got ticket for my mom to go to Mexico, bus supuse to leave at 7:45 pm we got there 40 min early as they ask us to be on time ... I asked to change the ticket for next day she said I had to pay a penalty if 30% to change it, so ok we decide she will still leave the lady told us the bus was delay an 1:30 min ok nothing we can do .. we documented her 2 luggage and we left we got back at 9.

We waited until 10:15 the driver saw 6 people there an announce they over sell the bus and he only had 2 seats ... my mom seat was empty so we proceed to try to put the luggage and this jackass said we need to pair 80 bucks for one backpack what was already documented soooo what ?? (! ?? Wth .... I told him ok give me a receipt and he said he can't gig us nothing lol I said ok you want 80 bucks for a bag we already documented and weight with nothing to tell we pay you ??? Lol yeah no obviously the office was close since 8 nothing to talk to,.,

Don't travel with this company worst service ever! Hope you lose your license this is not the way to treat passengers bud 234 10/8/17

Usually never posted reviews but this time it's outrageous. Today I bought a ticket for my mom, we arrived at 7pm to board the truck at 7:45 the manager said that he had been portrayed and asked to change it until tomorrow he told me that he had to pay 30% to cancel as if it was my fault that they they were late !!!

Anyway 9:15 we talked and nothing truck arrived until 10:15 and went so far as to say that the truck had been over sold and that only two people were leaving there were 10 people, my mom was one of those two and when they were going to upload their suitcases, the guy wanted to charge me 80 extra dlls for suitcases that had already been documented and I asked him for a receipt and that he could not give me anything he threatened that he would not get on until he realized that he was recording it and changed that in phoenix They were going to charge 1 extra per pound !!! Obvious no one to talk to

I hope they take away their licenses to operate, it is a shame this kind of service

Usualmente nunca posted reviews pero está vez es indignante. Hoy compre boleto para mi mamá, llegamos 7pm para abordar el camión de las 7:45  la encargada dijo que venía retratado y pregunte por cambiarlo hasta el día de mañana me dijo que tenía que pagar 30% por cancelar como si fuera mi culpa que ellos venían tarde!!!

En fin 9:15 hablamos y nada camión llego hasta 10:15 y llego a decir que habían sobre vendido el camión y que solo dos personas se ibas estaban 10 persona.., mi mamá fue una de esas dos y cuando iban a subir sus maletas, el tipo me quería cobrar 80 dlls extras por maletas que ya habían sido documentadas y le pedí recibo y que no podía darme nada me amenazó que no se iba a subir hasta que se dio cuenta que lo estaba grabando y cambió de que en phoenix le iban a cobrar 1 extra por libra!!! Obvio nadie con quien hablar

Ojalá les quiten las licencias para operar es una vergüenza este clase de servicio

(Translated by Google) It is a very small place, there are almost no waiting chairs and sometimes they do not give you information about the trucks, they are quite challenging.

Awful service. I scheduled an appointment to recalibrate for 8:30am I drive out 45 min to arrive at 830 and apparently they didn't know and I waited until 9:15 for someone to arrive. Their mailbox is always full. My bestie needed to get her interlock device and I told her whatever you do. Don't use draegers nor use 1st interllock to install anything.... so unprofessional...so disappointed 😞  in general draegers installations will forget about their appointments.... 3 different people I dealt with.. all had me waiting for over 30 min< /Text>

<review>Honestly getting my dui was scary and the thought of having a breathalyzer was even scarier. I was super nervous and didn't know anything about where to get it installed. When I found this place I was so relieved. He is super chill and very informative and doesn't judge. Anytime I had questions or needed to come in, he was always so nice and understanding. Definitely recommend to anyone that needs to install the breathalyzer. Never getting a dui again BUT I know where to come if i ever did and can assure myself I'd be in good hands!! Thank you so much!!</review>< name>

Hands down one of the best interlock locations around! Helps out the best they can! And beyond! Good people. Mike is one terrific human being.  Highly recommend this place here! I never have any issues and if I have trouble with getting there they work with me every time. Don't look around just go here for your ignition interlock! The best!</text>

By far the best company to deal with. They worked with me to try to find the best solution for my situation. I had an out of state DUI and they worked with me and even filed my paperwork which was for out of state. I have to have it for 4 years and I have no regrets. Always recommend them if I ever hear anyone say they got a DUI. Thanks 1st Interlock. You guys are the best!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Unsure about where to go for the service and what device to choose among the many out there, I took some time to read reviews and found consistency with the Drager product, and with this company. And I'm glad I did. I had no unwanted issues with the device and had a very positive experience with 1st Interlock employees in terms of customer service and technical questions. In short, they were professional, knowledgeable, helpful throughout my five months of having used the device. Thanks!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1535644887048, 'text': 'Anthony, your kind words are very much appreciated sir.'}<//resp>< GmapID>

<Review>As unfortunate as it is to have an ignition interlock, 1st Interlock made the entire process much easier and less demeaning.  Mike is great and super helpful.  The device is simple and user-friendly and the message screen is great! It notifies you of any issues and gives you 5 days to take it in to the service center to verify what is going on.  I definitely recommend this provider to anyone needing to take care of an interlock requirement in the area.  You WON'T be disappointed!</Review><user_name>ABQ</user_name>< userid>

I've been a customer with this company (location) for over 6 months ....Mike the owner is all around super awesome...prices are great .I always leave my appointments very satisfied....he goes over and beyond to work with whatever situation your in ...and he's always quick to respond when messaged or called with any concerns...just as the review before mine said Mike treats you as a normal person not like a criminal which is exactly how I was treated at intoxalock. I would highly recommend using this company(location) if your needing to full fill your DMV requirements stress free!!!!</Text>

<Text>My trip to 1st interlock today was a good experience.  Mike gave excellent and very helpful information on how to use the interlock.  He had patience to practice with me and how to use it properly. I had forgot and left something behind and he called me to inform me and was a totally good person to return it to me himself.  Now a days it's rare to find a company that really gives the service and attention I received today.  Thank you Mike.

<Review>I called so many companies trying to find an interlock company to use, and when Mike answered the phone, I knew I'd found the person with whom I would do business. Mike was the first person I'd talked to that day (after about 12 calls) that sounded human and that cared. He was kind and calm and helpful and answered my "many" questions with patience and intelligence, and can I say again, kind and calm.

I have been using his service for almost two months and have had not one single issue. When I had question first using the device, Mike was there! Mike answered the phone on a Saturday, when he wasn't feeling well to answer my call and answer a question! That's the kind of service you get with this company! Mike is ALWAYS there and helpful and kind and calming.

It means so much to find good people doing business who have personal standards that permeate all they do and how they conduct themselves when doing business. Mike is a real find, especially when you have to deal with issues like Interlock devices and the DMV, etc. He and his company are the bright spot in the whole experience!

Thank you, Mike!!!</Review><date>1485651620074<//date><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1535646716858, 'text': 'Hello Lisa, thank you for taking the time to leave a lengthy review about your positive with us.'}</resp></record>

Mike is the man! Awesome prices, and I'm always in and out of here super quick. If you're one of the unfortunate people who have to have an IID installed in your car, I recommend this place 100%< /text>

1st Interlock made the whole process really convenient. It is affordable (monthly) and they are flexible and accommodating. It only takes a few minutes out of the month to update. I would highly recommend to family and friends.</Text>

Both Mike and Margarita at 1st Interlock are really friendly! The interlock device itself is very easy to use. I also had the option to re-calibrate every month or 2 months. I would definitely recommend 1st Interlock for anyone who's facing similar situation!< /Review>

After my first interlock place went out of business they helped me go through the rest of my 5 months. They are fast and very friendly! I would recommend them to everyone. They accept cash or card which really worked out for me since I never carry cash on me! Great service and worked flexible with the times I needed around work. 😊<//text>

First interlock has always treated me right. They take my payments online and I just show up to the nearest location I have near me here in North Hollywood. There was an issue once when my direct deposit didn't go through the night before and first interlock still helped me calibrate my vehicle a day after without any extra late fee charge.. Thank you 1st interlock for your great and helpful assistance</text>

I have nothing but great things to say about this company. I was traveling across the country when my interlock quit working and Mike took amazing care of me even though I wasn't even one of his customers.  This IS the right interlock company for you I assure you of that!!!<//Text>

So unprofessional.. This message I received from him. After him stealing from us an extra month. The dmv said you are aware of the dates that each of your clients require.

Hello Shirley, the interlock is for your boyfriend and he was not double charged. His monthly rate that we even came to a deal with at the time of install is the same rate of the pro-rate for the amount of days he has had the device after his original install date. The only attitude came from your boyfriend when he threatened me over the phone. Also we do not appreciate you stealing our Mouthpieces from our North Hollywood location from the drawer and denying it when you were caught in the act.<//Text>

This company does not value customer service and believes it has captive customers. The company is only open from 8-5 m-f, so if you have a job you'll have to miss work to get your monthly service. My mechanic locked me out while working on my car overnight and I was told to pay 140$ to get unlock codes. They suggested I bill Honda for the charges! Please choose another company, you do have a choice of interlock provider!</Text>

Hidden fees they charge you for the entire month even thou you only need it for half the month. And my traction control light and engine light on my Lexuz has bin on Ever since they installed the interlock, I’m hoping it goes away once its removed.. which it never did now I can’t pass the smog test !!. The interlock device ruined the computer on my Lexuz and they did not want to do anything about it!! The ltraction control and and chenck engine light came on after I drove off from the interlock shop  I took it back and mike didn’t want to do anything about it.. I messed up in not staying there untill they fixed it!!.  Here’s the code to what  comes up in the scanner and your telling me  that has nothing to do with the interlock IGNITION.?  C1201 Engine control system malfunction ??!  Oh yeah and Fail test for eating bread or drinking cranberry juice or eating a  Green Apple or smoking mint cigarette 10 min before blowing in the Device smh .. another thing everything in the my engine is connected to the brain (computer)of my car so you had to connected something to my car in order for the interlock to work in my car .< /Text>

If we pro-rated your month of service it would have equaled $90 plus tax for the month rather than the $78.03 with tax that you pay. All of our fees are clearly printed on the first page of our contract. The 7 failed tests you had on your device are the only additional fees you paid with us. As for your vehicle, you were with us for just over a year and not once did you mention anything about a check engine light on your car, also our device does not connect to your vehicles computer nor does it have anything to do with your vehicle failing SMOG sir.'}<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2ce261cf7f217:0x9bfa7d6954abf1e< /GmapID></record>

< review>
I use to love it there till we got new management we .my mom dad lived in the biggest one in there it was beautiful with 4 car garage we kept the place really nice I was on a 25 year lease and they still kicked me out my mother did that for a reason so I  would never have to worry about finding something  else I have been down a very rough road since then and I  blame it on poor management for not going by the guide we lines of the contract  but  other then that the park is beautiful</review>

Great place! The food was unique and tasted amazing. I had the Fried Chicken and Egg Biscuit and it was full of flavor. The vibes are great and there's always good music playing. I love how the restaurant gives you a feel of both the indoors and outdoors, it's a beautiful set up. The owner is so nice and makes you feel welcome. I'll definitely be back for more!< /text>

One of the coolest restaurant designs in all of Fullerton. You totally feel like you are back in time in the 1800s, hanging out at the local pub...except underground. The walls, the decor, all fantastic. Not to mention the food is ridiculously tasty. If you don't mind spending a little more for an excellent dining experience, this is the place to go.<//Text>

<text>I love this place, I wish there was a place like this near me.   I love that they have all of these great vegan options - I'm not a vegan but the dishes they offer are kind of like those in the Thug Kitchen website and cookbook - they're just flat-out delicious, you don't need to be a vegan to enjoy them.</text></record>

Calivino Wine Pub is an amazing place to visit. Located just a few blocks from both the Honda Center and Angel Stadium, I love visiting prior to games and to try their newest Wine selection. The Food is simply amazing. Even better, the staff know exactly what beer and wine works best for all of their food pairings. Would highly recommend this place to anyone!<//Review>

Friendly staff, delicious food, and good drinks. I highly recommend the spinach dip. I would upload photos, but ate it all before I thought of doing so! Would recommend. 5/5<//Text>

Came here on a busy Friday night just in time to order off the happy hour menu. Be forewarned that they are located next to Angel Stadium & close to Honda Center so plan ahead for traffic on Katella. Tell the parking lot attendants that you have reservations here & they won't charge you to park. They take reservations luckily.

On to the food & wine both of which were very good. We ordered each food item on the happy hour menu. Our favorites were the bacon wrapped dates drizzled with honey & both types of sliders which were hearty and so amazing. The wedge fries were good and bone out wings just typical. The Leaping Horse cab wine was quite good. Service was very attentive initially but after initial orders & food was delivered we needed to ask for water refill & then find our server for the check. It's a very small restaurant but very busy on a Friday night especially with games going at each stadium. On the up side we were able to hang out for 2 hours & never felt them breathing down our backs to leave. I will definitely be back.</Text>

Such a charming place with an excellent menu and wine offering.  We had delicious appetizers, wine, and an excellent piece of cheesecake!  I'd definitely come back & recommend it to others.< /text>

Wine was good and our server was nice. Sadly I don't know her name. I recommend getting the flight with three wines of your choice. It's 15 dollars, but cheaper compared to two full on glasses.</review>

<text>Nice little place with reasonable prices and friendly staff. There was a random drunk person being a little disruptive prior to our whole party arriving so that was uncomfortable for the first person who got to our table alone, but otherwise she and all of us enjoyed our time drinking and eating.< /text>< pictures>

I went with my best buddy to see Star Girls Burlesque; it was AMAZING!!! The place was made up like the Mos Eisley Cantina ( or Jabba's palace?) Drinks were Star Wars galaxy themed and the show was positively outstanding!< /Review>

We made our first visit on a Tuesday night, which apparently was "trivia night"... Having a person on a loud microphone wasn't my idea of a cool wine bar. Service was "eh" and the food was pretty good. I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, to try something new in the area. I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet evening in a typical wine bar (at least in trivia night). The vibe was more of a sports pub with nicer food.< /text>

<Text>This was a surprisingly good little unassuming location tucked into an inline center near Anaheim Stadium. Tables made of reclaimed wood are the staple, but there is also plenty of seating at the bar and a couple of comfortable couches with lower tables. Decor is minimalist. I had a burger made of Albacore that was unique and delicious. My wife enjoyed a more traditional burger she thought was well executed. Service was very attentive. Plenty to choose from for wine or beer enthusiasts too.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Poorly managed!! Need better servers!!

Friday night with an event at the Honda center....

The server seemed to be panicked in major distress hahahah

I understand being busy but this place is tiny. It is a small place approx 10 tables and a bar. However, three tables were reserved with nobody sitting there yet.  She walked by us four times didnt acknowledge our presence.

After standing there for awhile, she opens her mouth and rudely says she is to busy to clean tables or the bar so we have to wait.  The other server never turned around from the register to help out.

They had dirty glasses and plates stacked behind the bar.

We left!!</Text>

“Good Place”
Stopped in here for dinner this evening. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door by Amande who was also our waitress. I was immediately impressed by the upscale ambiance of the place. We ordered the marinated olives as an appetizer. They were delicious.< /review>

<Review>WOW -- I came by purely by accident -- great food -- I had the classic burger and it was juicy and cooked to perfection.  Unfortunately I came in the middle of the day before a work meeting so I could not enjoy one of the local beer or wines that they have --- will be back next time I am in Anaheim... after work!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This is located in the same center as Hooters (for lack of a better POI).  A little hard to locate since there's no signage pointing to this restaurant from the street.   But alas we found it.   We got here at opening and we were warmly greeted by the only staff member that we actually saw the whole time we were there.   Very friendly and attentive service.   Ordered the boneless wings (it tasted like teriyaki chicken), the blue burger (it was good) and the lamb burger (it was also good).   Wished the burger patty itself was a little bigger or was the bread too big.  But would rather have a bigger patty of course.   Overall it was good.</text>

We did the flights of red and whites. Excellent choices offered. A few outside of our comfort zone but plesently surprised! We liked them all. We ended with the Salted Carmel Brownie, very sinful. Overall, it was a quiet, nice, relaxing evening of great wine and dessert.<//text>

<username>Scott Dailey< /username><Time>1554383373419</Time><rate>5</rate><Text>What a lovely dining alternative to the boring and utterly forgettable spots like Season's 52 and other pretend tasteful bistros. Darcy served me and my dinner companion from the bar moments before the place became absolutely packed (more on that in a moment).

I order a burger - bleu I believe - along with their roasted/grilled brussel sprouts. We let Darcy decide the wines and she did an incredible job matching our characteristic descriptions with delightfully big, tannic and red wines.

This is a tiny place, which for me, gives it instant credibility - or at least that's been my experience. In my personal travels, there seems to be a positive correlation between the size of a restaurant and how good it turns out to be. The smaller, the better. Ha! Who knew with all the hype about size mattering?!

As I mentioned, this place got super busy within 10 minutes of my arrival. It was empty when I got there. So at first, Darcy was all ours. She was engaged, attentive and wildly informed. But when the place got busy and the entire restaurant was hers alone to handle, she got a bit more scarce. But as much running as she was doing, she managed to repeatedly check-up on us, our wine, food and general satisfaction. She never changed her mood and never let on that she was as busy as she was. I was impressed, given how often we all dine out only to encounter an angry, over-stressed server, with no time for our needs.

The food is rustic, its presentation inviting, colorful and thoughtfully plated. He wines were delightful pairings and Darcy extremely capable of discussing and advising on them.

I was her eon business and am from NJ - right outside NYC. I cannot find a place like this here in NJ. This was a gem. I'd recommend it and be sure Darcy is there to help you. She was, combined with the love on a plate and in a glass that she served us,  what you want out of a dining experience.<//Text>< Pics>

I was very disappointed at the chicken pesto sandwich. Chicken was hard and bland. Couldn't taste the pesto. It was tasteless! What a letdown. I requested an aioli dipping sauce for the fries . It tasted better than plain ketchup. Short rib poutine was filling and meat was a bit burned.</Review></record>

The food is good and I forget which night of the week it is, but they have happy hour specials on appetizers and wine.  The down-side is, it is so close to the baseball stadium that it's a hassle to go here if there is a home game.< /Review>

< Review>
Came here with my GF to have some quality girl time to catch up & wanted to check out this place to see what everyone's raving about.

I'm sorry to say that the food was just A-okay so I don't know if we ordered the wrong things or what.. =(

Food:
Bacon Dates (w/goat cheese & honey): 3 stars
The honey made this a bit too sweet & the goat cheese didn't really compliment the dates very well.

Crab cakes (jumbo lump crab, house remoulade lemon zest): 3 stars (just ok)
This was a bit on the burnt side & too greasy for my taste. The sauce that was on the side was too light & didn't go well with the crab cakes. There were only 2 on this plate which I was surprised when most other places give you at least 3 on a plate & this plate was a bit pricey too.

Ahi Salad (seared Ahi, soy citrus dressing, avocado): 1 star
This plate was a huge disappointment to me, the salad was ok but the dressing was way too sweet & the Ahi was very dry & very plain tasting & wasn't seasoned/ seared very well.

Decor & ambiance: B
Smaller than I thought it'd be, but it has the simple American decor w/ warm lighting which makes it a cozy place to hangout with friends & chill.

Overall, I 'd come rather to this place for their HH & drinks because they have a good wine selection & craft beers that they have here.

Tip: HH: Sunday - Friday | 3pm to 7pm
$5 Draft Craft Beers &           $5 Select Wines
$2 Off Select Menu Items

Wine Wednesday  Every Wednesday | 7pm to Close      1/2 Off Select Bottles

Thirsty Thursday   Every Thursday | 7pm to Close
1/2 Off Select Glasses of Wine<//Review>

Would give more stars but no one is wearing a mask and they aren't enforcing it. Right now they have Mikey's kilted kitchen making food and no one cooking wearing masks. No bartenders wearing masks either. It's a good way to get shut down<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Our bartenders do wear masks, but obviously not during your visit.  I'm wondering if it was during the power outage chaos - although no excuse.  We'll talk to our bartenders and our caterers.  We hope we can earn that 5 star review on your next visit."}</resp>

<review>I read the reviews and thought I would enjoy trying a new place .. WRONG.
Went into the place  and felt I was in the wrong place right away .. no masks. no distancing ... ordered a beer ... 6 ounces for $$$$7 and did not like it at all. Will Not be back.</review>< rating>

Went with the family (including 2 kids) after a snowboarding trip. Great unpretentious, dog friendly brewery. Great beer, music and food from a food truck! Would love to come back next time we are near by.<//Text>

<review>Best beer in Placerville. Actually they brew the best beer from Lake Tahoe to Sacramento. We have had it a few times during brew fest and other activities around town. They have a great selection and brew some very, very good beers. The best beers. They are beer magicians.< /review>< gmap_id>

Outbreak Brewing hosted this year's Mountain Vibe Music Festival pre show so of course we had to make the trek out from the Bay Area. They blocked off the parking lot and pulled in a a food truck that had the best burgers I've ever had! I'm not a huge beer fan but was pleasantly surprised to see a cherry beer on the menu! Everyone working the event we're super nice and personable. It was a great night and definitely worth the drive from the Bay! My only regret is not getting a growler of the cherry beer to bring home. Guess we will have to go back!<//Review>

Went mostly to see the band that was playing. Nice place, decent crowd. I am not a fan of IPA's, which seem to be all the rage. I like lagers or some ales. The choices were IPA's or porters. The first beer was good. Porter in the 'ville. The second beer was terrible...Porter Patrol. I could barely drink half of it...had a very peppery taste to me...felt nauseous after about 1/2 of it. Sorry that it just wasn't for me. Will probably go back when the band I went to see plays again but hope for a better beer experience.

Sounds like the Rye It would be a great beer for you to try and we should be getting that back on tap shortly. We are also looking at doing a Kolsh Ale which might fit the style you're looking for. I hope you give us another chance once we have these style on tap. Cheers."}<//response>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Love this place, glad we discovered it during Our short time in Hangtown.  Bartenders are very friendly, and the brewer/ owner I met was very down to earth as well.  It's a new place;  and strikes me as an as-yet  undiscovered gem.  It's on the main drag, but on one end / not the middle so it's a great place to begin or end your night in Placerville-  depending on which way you're going/ coming from.  I spent two weeks in California from North to South, and I'm still finding myself thinking about this place.  It'll be the first place I go if I ever find myself in Placerville again. The Jalapeño Porter was the hottest beer I've ever had.  I like the Fermu.</review><pics>None<//pics><Time>1510542746001<//Time>< GmapID>

So this is my review based on my last semester here the summer they got their preliminary accreditation back. I had a teacher from the first day told me I didn't look like I wanted to be there and that my tone of voice was not enthusiastic for being there to learn. To which I responded I worked graveyard at my new job last night after leaving a 60 hour a week job, I'm in the process of recuperating and at this moment don't have the energy to oblige you. Eventually I was singled out and several students went to the dean for his biased insensitive behavior. The dean had left in vacation and his secretary advised us of the process but gave us the understanding in situations such as these escalation was unlikely. We can continue the process, I continued so I ended up having a meeting with the deans representative, I gave him a well documented list of days and what was said during the interaction. I used specific language from the guide on reporting and honestly I cried from the repeating everything and the stress. Only to have the department tell the teacher he had various complaints and that he needed to change, that's it. Next day he came in and announced that if students had a problem they should come directly to him (as if anyone would feel comfortable leaving anonymity to say the things to his face) then proceeded to explain how he was right in his methods and how we were just just trying to get our way and then proceeded to allow students that came to him and apologized for not being good the chance to turn in late work. This was my experience dealing with the new administration and I will never go back to this school prior while an El Camino satellite school for several years had great experiences and teacher. And to boot they supposedly has summer financial aid for which I never received, so I needlessly suffered, was mistreated and put money into a class that was 4 units. Please follow your gut about teachers don't stay just bc you need the class it's really not worth the mental stress</text>

Some people really love to make exaggerations and degrade it's reputation due to it's name. Anyway, the classes are quite accessible since it's relatively small campus. The student success center has a sizeable library, computer lab, and tutoring services. Cafeteria food is reasonably priced and there's events hosted by students, faculty and guest speakers alike. It also has a partnership with Cal State Dominguez and other universities that enables students to secure their options when transfered. Many buses pass here, hence public transit is accessible and the Metro Blue Line Artesia station isn't too far. It has most general ed courses available. Personally, I've met some amazing and down to Earth people here, from all walks of life. They have interesting stories to share, but they get lost in the crowd and are dismissed. It's a blessing to follow their advice to pursue goals that are beyond academic. I've been a student here for a few semesters and cannot recall a bad experience.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>el Camino Compton is really convenient which is why I go here, classes do not fill up as often as Torrence, and it is close to my house. although convenient the staff at this school are unorganized, clueless and so rude. I went to the library to make a copy and they switched from having print cards to paying cash, i asked what happens to the money on my old print card and no one had an answer, then I pay to make copies and a couple of my copies the toner appeared to be low on, i asked if they could reprint because i didn't have anymore money and the library staff claimed to not know how to help me bc the system was new and they didn't have access to the printers so i had to just deal with it. I then go to financial aid to ask a question and they were beyond rude in there. the lady went to answer my questions stopped in the middle of her sentence to talk to someone else and never got back to me then said "I'm busy". i ask the guy in the office for a paper and he told me he couldn't help me either so i went to the computer lab to print the paper out myself, (bc they suggested i do that and then they would answer all my questions) i go to the computer lab to print and the gentleman in there was kind but the lady was soo rude it made me wish i didn't have to use the services. i spent 10 mins waiting on someone to help me just log onto the computer bc i didn't know the log in info and they kept telling me to hold on while they gossip a student finally helped me and the internet was so slow i waited 15 minutes (no joke) for page to load so i could print the bog fee waiver. i spent 50 cent to print the paper filled it out and took it back to financial aid only for them to tell me 1. i had to re sign up to ask a question bc they called my name while i was gone, and then 5 mins later tell me the system was down and they couldn't help anymore. lastly they told me that i couldn't even turn in the paper bc of my income last year (which i asked about 5 times and they kept not helping me) then when he seen i was frustrated he laughed. the staff at this school is garbage. your there to help students and you act like its a problem to do it... go find another job if you are miserable and rude about helping. ive had awesome professors and teachers this is more directed towards the financial aid office and computer lab staff< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I don't recommend this campus at all, some of the staff should learn to do the job they were hired to do, some of them such as Mrs Johnson, go so far being rude as to simply ignore you when you ask normal questions.<//Text>< username>

<text>The records department is absolutely horrible. I called for 1 week straight at various times and no one ever answered or returned any of my messages. I had to call a different department for someone to hand the phone to Rosa in records and when I spoke to her she said she'd call me back and haven't heard from her since. They have no sense of urgency there.</text><user_id>112790249797198931265</user_id><Rating>1< /Rating><Time>1496401609541< /Time><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

With an intriguing name like Dickey’s for a Barbecue joint, I honestly didn’t know what to expect! I found later that it was a chain, but as I began to see more and more of this establishment popping up, I decided to give it a go!

Upon visiting, I happened to see a sign that was promoting a special for their 2 meat plates! It sounded like a lot of food, and because I had a massive appetite that day, I decided this was perfect!

When I received my plate, honestly I was a bit disappointed at the size of it. I thought I would be so hungry afterwards, that I have even began thinking about where I should eat next! Boy, was I wrong! I was stuffed half way through the meal!

The ribs were mediocre at best. Quite tough and not as tender as I’d have liked them to be. The brisket was good, but also dry. The chicken breast was actually done right. Not at all dry, and seasoned well! If anything, I think if you were to douse everything in barbecue sauce, it would have been delicious! My favorite sides of the night were the barbecue beans!

Great place to get barbecue at a bargain! Just remember that it is what it is!<//Text>

Spotlessly clean.  Fresh meat. Delish sides. Decent portions. Nice BBQ coming from a chain. Skip the lil cornbread...not worth the carb count.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Food was pretty good and pretty decent price! It's pretty small on the inside probably like 80 people max. We ordered Family Pack (6 people serving) of Brisket and Ribs and when they brought the trays out we were surprised it looked pretty small but don't let that fool you. We all got full after digging in! The service was pretty quick we got served probably 5 minutes after we ordered. They have 3 options of BBQ (Original, sweet, spicy) that are self serve. Their beverage cups double as reuseable souvenir cups, super cute! They also have a complimentary icecream machine! You can get a free drink if you check in on Yelp.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9LuocJRdZPmSyQBsTlQcahwGXRWnZdL_L3qI8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

Food has improved since it first opened in Alhambra.  So so on service.  Entered through back entrance, no visible menu, none offered.  Had to ask for options for family meals, still none offered.  Ordered by asking for two meats with sides, clerk said they did have that as an option.  Would have been nice to compare with other menu items.< /Review>

We ordered from here for the 1st time.  Dickeys used to be in Ventura county.  They left before I could try them.  Well I didn't miss much.  In Ventura County there is a BBQ place named Red's BBQ.  Dickey's can't match their flavor not price.  The Texas toast was great Red's doesn't sell them.  The Mac N Cheese was creamy.  Overall I don't think it's worth the price.< /Text>

This was absolutely terrible. We ordered brisket and spare ribs. Both items were more fat than anything else. The ribs were so salty you can't taste anything elae. They need to taste their food before they serve it. We will NEVER eat there again.<//Review>

< Review>
Honestly I had high expectations of this place the price is not bad at all for the portions.  ordered the 2 for $25 which is really good . Ordered both brisket and pulled pork but were very tough and not at all tender. This ruined my wife’s bbq experience although I thought it was okay at best< /Review>

< Review>
This place is absolutely the worst place in all of California! The service is abhorrent & every single employee is beyond incompetent! I’ve given this place multiple chances & each time they manage to mess up even worse than the previous time. I’m starting to wonder if the qualifications to work here are 1. Does not know how to read/no comprehension skills 2. Has a bad attitude 3. No customer service experience. If a customer comes back to say “I’m missing __” then logically you’d think the employee would apologize and make it right, not argue & make excuses. How can you actually mess up so bad that you “forget” to pack 8 sides. But don’t worry, you didn’t “forget” to up-charge me $5. I’m done with this place & so should everyone else! Can’t believe you let your employees look and act like this.</Review>

I was initially excited for this place but it did bot deliver on my expectation and my experience will keep me from giving them another chance. The barbecue meats were all dry, they contained excessive seasoning, and the food was served cold. I would not serve this food to anyone and I would definitely not recommend this business.</text>

This spot obviously knows how to take care of their clients. Always with a super nice approach. The food is reasonably priced, regularly tasty and clean.<//Review>

This place is horrible it was about 830pm and they pretty much told us that we couldn't sit down and eat our food and we had to take it to go. We didn't even get to see the menu. The attitude was horrible and it was just overall unpleasant.will never be going here again .< /Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>The best place to eat BBQ at for a good price you dont need to break the bank with this place. The meat here is tender and cooked to perfection where it comes off the bone easily. The portions here are pretty big and the deals they have are a cant beat price anywhere else. I also like how there BBQ sauce here is self served so you cant put as much as you want which is more convient. Also the staff here cares alot about there customers here and it shows.<//text>< rate>

There aren't a lot of American style BBQ places in Alhambra so this place hit the spot. Ordered the 2 item combo which included ribs and jalapeno sausage. Ribs were tender and sausage was flavorful. Spicy BBQ sauce on the side was good. Free soft serve at the end is always a plus! Free WiFi and free parking in the back.<//review>

My wife and I thought to try this new location. We got a variety of meats. They were all dry and barely edible. Staff was very friendly but meats were meh. This location can learn some things from the other sites. Pasadena is closest and most visited by us and is fantastic. Hasn't let us down yet.< /Review>

<text>Having a Dickey's Barbecue Pit close to my residents is a comforting thought for knowing that a bit of Texas is not that far away. Yeehaw! I'll be your Huckleberry.
So my thoughts for this location so close again to Home I think, 🤔 Awesome!! Much obliged 🤠<//text>< Pics>

<review>honestly, no dickeys lemonade. No original dickeys sweet tea. Unacceptable!!! Also, staff was more worried about her cell phone than my order. Also, how about mentioning the specials for the day? Terrible, terrible customer service..not the standard dickeys experience I've come to expect. I'll drive the extra 5 miles to Pasadena next time.</review><Rating>1< /Rating><user>114471274421533443144< /user>< Gmap_id>

This place sucks balls. The meat has no flavor. No ribs in stock. Small portions for ridiculous prices. Avoid this place at all cost.< /Text>

< Review>
Kayak Horizons was wonderful! We decided to make a quick day trip to beat the heat, and couldn't have been happier. The owners are lovely and incredible helpful. You're free to kayak around the cove and return at your leisure, since you're charged a very reasonable price by the hour. We loved exploring, and found and shallow area with thousands of sand dollars!</Review>

Chose this place because I prefer sit-in, closed-style kayaks rather than the sit-on-top ocean kayaks I see around. Would come again.</review><gmap_id>0x80ece19d293cc681:0x6ade552bcafc3e26<//gmap_id>< pics>

Great way to go from the mainland to the sandbar/other side of the bay..... Take shorts because the sand is soggy and the kayak will not move any more..... Also there's jellyfish in the water so make sure to watch out. And last you will find a lot of sea dollars<//Review>

Great price and no fuss. We only had to fill out one form and were on the water in less than ten minutes. Saw plenty of otters and sea lions. Staff was kind and helpful.</Review>

Kayaks were great - service was terrible . The owner was incredibly rude to me when I dropped one of the passengers off early telling me he was “trying to run a business “ gave a feeble apology when I returned at end of hour. Staff is at best unfriendly and at worst rude<//text>

1st rate.  We went on a mid-morning in mid-week.   Everyone had a great time.  They got us in the water very efficiently and gave us much needed pointers about the currents in the area where we'd be.</Text>

Dennis is the best patient helpful and tell s funny  jokes. You want a good experience goto Kayak Horizons. They also give you great tips and instruction. I did it my first time at 62 and was surprised at how safe and level the Kayaks stay</review>

This guy is a joke.  It says open 9 to 5  7 days a week on his shop door but I went by the store and called multiple times on a monday, called again multiple times on tuesday and and again on Wednesday.  No Answer!!! Answering machine has this goofball saying were open 9 to 5  7 days a week.  So I leave a message and never heard back.  Listen, just be honest and post when you feel like working you sellout, and have the damn calls routed to your cell phone for christ sake!  I was willing to by 2 kayak life vests and 2 paddles to contribute to local business but not from this clown.  Doesn't even deserve 1 star.</Text>

<Review>Great place to shop if you need any Asian grocery food items and a good selection of frozen and fresh seafood items. They also have a pretty good selection of fresh produce and specialty bread. I prefer grocery shopping here over many of the other places in this area.</Review>< Pictures>

KP International Market has almost anything you could imagine available for sale. The shelves are decked from top to bottom with interesting goodies. This place is huge but still manages to stay organized and clean. You'll never know what you'll find unless you head on in.</text>

< Review>
Face masks required. Protective food prep type gloves and hand sanitizer also required but furnished by merchant. Entire store sanitized every Sunday night. The amount and selection of food stuff is incredible. This was my first visit to this market place and I would say it is the size of a Costco but all food stuff. The fish market has just about everything, alive and dead. Although I went there looking for alive lobsters but they were sold out.< /Review>

<name>Mitzi Garnett</name><review>This store has the single most extensive collection of products from around the world and it's all useful, not just the junk food. The veggies are amazing, the dry goods are mind blowing and the meats are very accommodating. I love Asian markets but this is SO much more and as a Chef really helps cover my specialty needs. Worth the drive.< /review>< rate>

Health focused policy is appreciated... But it seems management is asking for some negative attention with inappropriate dealings with customers like making customers wear gloves that do not fit my size or no service to you. Causing stress, and anxiety on customers when we are NOT in height of pandemic is not smart.

I won't be back. Nobody cares about that fact... But many people in line pointed they will not be back either.<//text><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

<text>Huge Store with lots of variety of items . They do have halal meat here such as chicken, beef, and lamb. There is sandwhich meat, sausage, and steaks for a great price. For about 24-26 pieces of drumsticks it varies by pound , so I paid about $5 to $6 each pack. It's good quality halal meat and clean. Pricing is good here compared to other smaller businesses halal shops.< /text>< pictures>

<text>These people advertised specials in the meat department and then when you show up they don't have what the ad is advertising and then when you ask for some help they laugh at you and keep talking between themselves. They spend a lot of time blocking the meat aisle with their cards without doing any work. I will never come back to this place. They are rude and insensitive to others around them.

<text>Keeping this virus on lockdown! Seriously though, I do applaud their precautionary measures.
Amazing produce section and wonderful grocery selection.  I want to get lost for hours.
The food court was a disappointment.</text>< GmapID>

< Review>
There is a large variety of produce which was the first surprise. I was very impressed with the selection of fish and sea food.  At first site I thought it was fairly small but then I discovered the other sections. There are two main sections for the groceries and a third section after the check stands that is a food court. Tucked away next to the check stands is a small room with additional alcohol. Some of the bottle there are super cool shapes.</Review>

A bit overkill with the covid precautions in my opinion. Of course you have to wear a mask but you also have to put on gloves they supply and sanitize said gloves before going in the store. Anyways the store is usually quite crowded but that's for good reason, this place has all kinds of food you really can't find anywhere else. All the weird Japanese/Korean candy you could dream of, samyang fire noodles in bulk, unique alcohol I've never even heard of, 6 and 12 packs of soju, the biggest seafood selection I've ever seen, and that's just scratching the surface. You could really spend all day looking around this store if you can handle the crowds. Buying unique food and trying it out makes for a fun date too! Check this place out if you haven't already, you won't regret it.< /review>

<Review>I visited this food store for the first time a week ago, and was very impressed with both the selections of produce, beef and seafood.  Their prices are also very reasonable as are items from abroad.  The quality of the food available for purchase surpassed my expections.< /Review><Date>1615951530248< /Date><user_id>100321119333175628713<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

This place has a lot to offer. Fresh produce, dairy, canned goods and fresh meats.
There us quite a choosing of products in cookware, eating utensils and other kitchen items.
I love the tea section where you can find strains that most stores don't carry. My favorite ginseng comes in many varieties.
Lots of sweets from all around the world.
Spices, yes they have them.
Also they have a variety of beers from different countries.
Many more items as well as at the checkout there is a bakery with lots of treats. Also in that area is a food court with international meals.
You may need a transaction reader to buy some items as some international items are void of English wording.
One visit and you will be hooked.<//Review>

<Review>This is a fun place to shop. You never know what kind of imported and domestic foods you're going to find. They also have an amazing fruit and vegetable selection. I enjoy coming here any chance I get l. I tend to load up on sweets, but its good to look at the meat because the beef that they carry has an amazing marbling to it<//Review><GmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff< /GmapID>< Rate>

Not only are they the only store going above and beyond in sanitation but you can get everything and I do mean everything! Their produce is absolutely unmatched by ANY store! Fish selection is incredible! Prices are cheap! Staff is amazing! Wish I worked there!<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>Displace has a variety of culture ingredients that you can't find very many places around the Sacramento area. During this covid situation they have handled it extremely well with the highest safety. You're given gloves, hand sanitizer, and wearing face masks. Since I'm from the Bay area the staff in here are much more friendlier.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><user_name>Son Lee</user_name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaQNHiCpzVZQLJHb_N9vEXl9H4H4OCInC-ZFBD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMA_cvjcuEhab7bwwvbgIgdbePsFIX3h6Lv08X2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response><userid>113231228657077119157< /userid>< date>

<date>1526273627653< /date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>There is a large variety of produce which was the first surprise. I was very impressed with the selection of fish and sea food.  At first site I thought it was fairly small but then I discovered the other sections. There are two main sections for the groceries and a third section after the check stands that is a food court. Tucked away next to the check stands is a small room with additional alcohol. Some of the bottle there are super cool shapes.< /review>< Pictures>

If you buy the bread from their bakery then
Do not lose your receipt!!
There might be bugs in your bread.

I found bugs in the bread from their bakery. Twice in a row!!!!!
First one was from their soboro bread
And second one was from mommos? Bread.

I know but this is my first fault.
First one was even a live fruit fly. I didn't complain about first one because i was too tired to go back to KP.
But after i found bugs from second one (not even one) i had to.

After that i went to their customer service and customer service lady asked me if i have a receipt. Which i didn't have.
I know it's my fault that i lost the reciept but i don't usually expect bugs from the bread and keep the reciept for that reason.

But if the receipt were really matter, they could've checked their camera. It's everywhere.
Customer service lady said without receipt she won't do anything about my problem. Didn't even check up my bread.
It was really disappointing.
I go to KP at least twice a week. And can't be more disappointed.

I don't need that couple dollars refund. The point is they didn't even check my bread and kept saying we get bread every morning and there's no way there can be bugs in there.

If you want to be working in the customer service you need to listen to customer. It's not just for return. Literally it's damn "Customer Service." Not refund service.

I'll never ever buy their bakery and will report this for other customers.

It's not clear photos but it has legs smh.<//review>

They have their covid act together with social distancing, hand sanitizer and plastic gloves available. The seletion is incredible. If you can't find what you want, it may not exist! The prices are lower than other places so I like to stock up on those items. KP International Market is a great asset to the Sacramento region and I look for excuses to go. The downside is that it's a bit far from my home so not exactly convenient.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Couldn't find some of the groceries I needed, it's more of an Asian store. Prices are high.<//Review>

KP International Market / Koreana Plaza is adjoining. This place is like an adventure of discovery! Foods from all over the globe essentially.  Prices are comparable, and many specials throughout. The day I visited, the "Pocky" cookie vendor had a booth setup in the store, and if you bought 3 cookie packages you get a free insulated zippered grocery bag.  There is a food court on the Plaza entrance,  and in the grocery entrance there is also a small booth to buy freshly made Korean street food fare. Happy shopping!<//Review>

KP is great for just about everything and particularly for hard to asian items. They have my favorite Lao Gan Ma chili sauce, a billion different gochujangs, tons of different ramen, and their produce section is always fresh and stocked with stuff you may not see elsewhere like those long skinny eggplants (the only kind I like). They also have Indian, Mexican, and Eastern European stuff, and a small selection of American groceries. The store is massive and often busy but the staff are super helpful, even when I'm horribly mispronouncing a random item I'm trying to locate amongst the maze of aisles.<//text>

<Text>Variety and number of fresh produce and all other items is impressive. The sushi grade tuna and salmon are worth the drive alone. The lavash bread, imported nectar, isles and isles of speciality items at very reasonable prices, all things considered. Well worth a look.< /Text>< Name>

Great selection of asian packaged dessert snacks like Swiss rolls, mochi, buns, pancakes in the refrigerated section. An extensive variety of produce too ! They are being extra cautious w/ covid making you wear gloves, mask and then sanitizing the gloves before entering, which is a big thumbs up on safety 👌🏼<//review>

Very mindful of the virus, more so than most big name stores, which I like.  Very clean and well stocked on almost everything.  Very impressive especially during a time like this.  Prices are higher than what i'm used to but they do have things that you can't really get anywhere else.  Line to get into the store is surprisingly brief.  This review will mostly only be valid for Corona.  Ive visited when life was normal and i have no complaints other than certain prices being higher which is understandable.<//review>

<text>This has been my go to Korean/Asian Market since the beginning of Covid19 and I’m unhappy to have to write to this review but I think people are obligated to know. Workers do not take wearing masks seriously anymore. This is especially concerning with the cashiers who are at the closest proximity to you, who don’t take precaution by simply wearing a mask for the protection of others. Today there were a lot of these workers, last time I did a grocery run it was just a few.

What I was most shocked to see were all the women working at checkout chatting away with their masks completely down, nose and mouth exposed, while handling customers with no consideration. Not sure why this is happening, perhaps an act of rebellion or a statement of some sort. I honestly don’t understand why they’re not taking precautions/customer safety seriously.

I was very disheartened to see they weren’t even phased to put up their masks over their nose and mouth at least with the customers with children and babies at check out. This was very weird, especially considering the spike in cases, but also because other stores, workers are very diligent with taking safety precautions for customers with at least wearing a mask over their mouth and nose.

I started coming here because someone in my family suggested this place since my go to Bay Area Korean/Asian markets were having Covid19 cases with workers, but now, I wouldn’t be surprised if this place has workers with it too.<//text>< Pictures>

So many great options at really reasonable prices. Some of my favorite things include the banh mi, fried cuttlefish, and spiral potatoes. They have tons more options though, like hot dogs, tacos, piroshkis, and much more. The bakery in the food court is also full of tasty treats!</text>

<Text>Store smells like fish dept.all the way on other end of building.( This is a HUGE store )Ok with me but was not ready for that in vegetable dept. No frog legs. Bought 60$ of oysters. Luckily I know pre opened oysters are dead. They had 1 bag that half were open & would not close no matter how much I shook them.
They have MANY products that you would never see in an Non K.P. store !!!
I mean this as a positive but honest review . 4 stars 👍.
I will drive from Roseville to Rancho again .  Allegedly There was one ? In Roseville at one time but Yelp or Google maps does not recognize it or can produce an address .< /Text><user>105155165881228087952< /user><GmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff</GmapID><Response>None< /Response><Name>Scott Mason</Name><Date>1600563251827</Date>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>If you buy the bread from their bakery then
Do not lose your receipt!!
There might be bugs in your bread.

I found bugs in the bread from their bakery. Twice in a row!!!!!
First one was from their soboro bread
And second one was from mommos? Bread.

I know but this is my first fault.
First one was even a live fruit fly. I didn't complain about first one because i was too tired to go back to KP.
But after i found bugs from second one (not even one) i had to.

After that i went to their customer service and customer service lady asked me if i have a receipt. Which i didn't have.
I know it's my fault that i lost the reciept but i don't usually expect bugs from the bread and keep the reciept for that reason.

But if the receipt were really matter, they could've checked their camera. It's everywhere.
Customer service lady said without receipt she won't do anything about my problem. Didn't even check up my bread.
It was really disappointing.
I go to KP at least twice a week. And can't be more disappointed.

I don't need that couple dollars refund. The point is they didn't even check my bread and kept saying we get bread every morning and there's no way there can be bugs in there.

If you want to be working in the customer service you need to listen to customer. It's not just for return. Literally it's damn "Customer Service." Not refund service.

I'll never ever buy their bakery and will report this for other customers.

It's not clear photos but it has legs smh.</Text>< Pics>

Very mindful of the virus, more so than most big name stores, which I like.  Very clean and well stocked on almost everything.  Very impressive especially during a time like this.  Prices are higher than what i'm used to but they do have things that you can't really get anywhere else.  Line to get into the store is surprisingly brief.  This review will mostly only be valid for Corona.  Ive visited when life was normal and i have no complaints other than certain prices being higher which is understandable.</text>

This is an excellent store! So much variety!  One of my favorite places to come to when I stay in Sacramento!  They go above and beyond with their covid-19 protective measures.  They are awesome!!<//Text>

Super clean...I love that gloves were mandatory and KP provided the hand sanitizers and the gloves. Did not appreciate the Mexican workers stocking who did not know where products were stocked...acted like they didn't speak English?? People working there need to be helpful.</Text>

This is the absolute BEST international foods store in the entire Sacramento County. It is in Rancho Cordova California. I go here to get everything I need when making Pho but they have an extremely expansive supply for pretty much any type of international foods you may be looking for and very economical pricing too.<//Text>

Store smells like fish dept.all the way on other end of building.( This is a HUGE store )Ok with me but was not ready for that in vegetable dept. No frog legs. Bought 60$ of oysters. Luckily I know pre opened oysters are dead. They had 1 bag that half were open & would not close no matter how much I shook them.
They have MANY products that you would never see in an Non K.P. store !!!
I mean this as a positive but honest review . 4 stars 👍.
I will drive from Roseville to Rancho again .  Allegedly There was one ? In Roseville at one time but Yelp or Google maps does not recognize it or can produce an address .< /Review>

This store is number one in my books for its the first store I believe that went above and beyond in providing safety items before you shop here. They provide with various sizes of gloves, mask and hand sanitizer for free at the entrance so you can shop safely. They care and other supermarkets should learn from them.  Thank you.<//Review>

<Review>No complaints about products or price, especially their strict protection policy during this virus season. But some of the cashiers are horrible, they treated customers like someone who owed them million dollars. Some cashier ladies made me nervous and I had to observe for a while before I pick a line to check out. Personally try avoid shopping here since KP is not the only affordable market in the city.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp><user>110105331110359789731</user>< Name>

Great fun to shop at and a huge, wonderful selection of Hispanic, Russian, Korean, Japanese, and many other types of food. The produce selection is diverse and inexpensive. The meat selection is also large and diverse. The entire overall atmosphere of the store is friendly, although good luck if you need to find something specific. The selection is so huge that finding one individual thing cam be a challenge. Even the staff don't always know.<//text>

This place is pretty big compared to others. It's clean and has a variety of food choices spanning the globe. From Asian foods, Middle Eastern, Russian and places in between. It is clean with friendly staff members that frequently sweep the aisles. The meat and seafood selections are great along with their fruits and vegetables. The grocery sections are well stocked with a plethora of options. Did I mention KP International food court? That's next door but that's for another time. Kimchi anyone?</Text>

Honestly one of the best stores ive been to, it has so many foods that you wouldnt get in America, hence being called an international market. But just there is such a big variety and if you want to make something such as, Lotus Root and Pork Rib soup, it has the ingredients for it there, or if you just wanna try something you havent had before, its a great place to go.</review>

Great place to get all your international and local foodstuff.
During this pandemic they have instituted policies that are awesome and you feel they have taken things seriously.
Kudos to the management team for looking out for everyone.<//Review>

KP Market is flipping amazing. Any type of Asian food you want it's here. Lambs, chickens, live crabs. Stores gigantic. They have an amazing hot food area with at least nine different types of Asian Foods, soups and noodles and chicken. Sarriette Oriental food imagined, amazing, go check it out for sure.< /Review>

But just there is such a big variety and if you want to make something such as, Lotus Root and Pork Rib soup, it has the ingredients for it there, or if you just wanna try something you havent had before, its a great place to go.</text>< Pics>

Probably the worst grocery store experience in Sacramento. The security is pretty hostile. They don’t allow any bags or bottles. The only good thing is the selection of goods and prices are decent. 99 Ranch is a little more expensive, but at least you don’t have to deal with TSA.</Text>

I've always enjoyed this store because of it's produce, meat, and wide variety of spices and seasoning. Since Covid-19 they have taken great precautions by enforcing safety measures and social distancing. I definitely respect the store and it's management even more.<//Review>

I cant express how much better of a market this is than any other... i would venture to say it's the number 1 market in Sacramento.  They have the best safety procedures for this pandemic and always have great deals.</Text>

<review>The produce is extravagant.  So much selection. Chinese eggplant, Japanese  eggplant,  Italian eggplant,  Indian eggplant,  Thai eggplant,  baby  eggplant...the only one that I didn't see was the "normal" Globe eggplant. Fresh Thai basil, Italian basil,  mint, coriander  and  tons of  other greens  that I only read about in cookbooks.  Only two types of tomatoes Roma and on-the-vine though.  Ok section of fruit lower prices than Raley's however they  varied in size and color, so only got grapes and bananas. The other sections were ok because the products were  in its own  language and I wearied over  picking  them up to read the U.S. labeling.  It's  definitely for people  who already know about the food.  There's one entrance where there's a table for one to put on protective gloves,  then another table to put on the hand sanitizer and a guard  at the entry point  to ensure compliance with mask, gloves and sanitizer.  I stayed  too long  in there looking at  everything because my hands  were  sweaty and my mask was making it hard to  breathe. The  only way out is through check out. Once  through check out, you are in the food  court  area.  Don't  make  a mistake like me and  try to  enter the market from the check out area  because  the guards will stop you  from  going  in. Also, the bathroom is  outside of the market and  you will have to leave your cart inside  the  market,  make sure you let the guard know that you are just  going  to  the bathroom.   They will give you instructions how to use the temporary lockers. There's no  bread or cereal aisle however there's a  bakery in the food court that sells milk toast and buns.<//review>< pics>

<review>What an incredible place. As soon as we turned in the parking lot my 6 year old said Gosh Dad I've never seen a bigger store. This is truly an international market. We are in the food court which was better than most asian food restaurants.

Best Asian and European grocery shop in the entire greater Sacramento area. If you are an immigrant came from Asia or Eastern Europe, you will love this place. Spacious parking space and Easy access to the light rail as well.</Text>

<review>One of my favorite places for a grocery haul, especially for ethnic foods. As a meat and seafood lover, I'd go there to pick up speciality cuts not available at a conventional grocery stores, farmer's markets, butcher's shops, or meat delivery services. Also has a great food court (although I do not usually eat there). Also conveniently located next to the light rail station.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Date>1577500527015</Date></record></dataset><record>

Arrived at about 8:30am on Saturday so not many people. Gloves and hand sanitizer at entrance , customers and employees all wearing masks and trying as best they can to not get up close. Good experience in these times. Had everything we were looking for but could see that stocks are a little lower than usual but still lots. Actually better experience than Raley's.</review>

<text>I really love coming here and the trip is definitely worth the drive there. There are various things here like fresh produce to even different kinds of instant noodles. Yes other Asian supermarkets are like that too but the biggest difference is that when you are done shopping, you are now where all the restaurants are. The restaurants have many different kinds of food that are served such as Vietnamese, American, Japanese, Mexican and the original Korean food. They also have a korean BBQ inside, you can buy some boba or tea and there is also a small cosmetic store. Would very highly recommend if you love a good meal after shopping!<//text>< Pictures>

I enjoy how many cultures this market has to offer. There is a huge food court/bakery/karaoke next to the grocery store. It does get a tad crowded at times. (not meant for the antisocial person).</review>

This place is great! My bro and I went in to stock up on rice and found several other tantalizing items at amazing prizes (like ice coffee drinks for a buck each). KP is immense, big enough to house a karaoke spot as well as a food court, both of which I look forward to checking out next time I roll through. In short immense size, superb selection, and good prices to boot.</text>

We like trying out various grocery stores. (This is our kind of date.😅) KP is so far the best we've tried. We've been getting all our produce here. Aside from being cheaper from other supermarkets, they have a big variety of products to choose from. They also have weekly special discounts like ribeye steak only for $3.29 per lbs. Isn't that a steal?!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This is a place you have to see to believe. It's more than an international market. If you need foods from anywhere but here this place probably has it. Wanna make your own home made sushi? This place has everything including sashimi grade tuna.</Review>

< review>
We were so hopeful for this grocery store. We arrived about thirty minutes after it opened, grabbed a basket and made our way in and out of every aisle the huge grocery store has (starting in the frozen food/produce working our way to the exit) The selection of lots of different frozen items was great, pricey, but they offer lots of different things. The produce selection seemed to have a huge variety as well and was also pricey. Making our way through the aisles of rice,noodles,asian sweets, teas etc it we definitely felt rushed, it wasn’t very crowded at all, but being in an aisle with 3 people and 3 baskets felt cramped so I can only image what its like when its busy. Checking out all the different drinks and breads towards the exit was great. So many options! The seafood, desserts and sweets all looked delicious, but we would never buy the seafood there everything in that back area looked FILTHY!! This store absolutely needs a deep cleaning. There were lots of rude shoppers and unhappy looking employees during our visit, no hellos, no greetings or smiles. Its not hard to be kind to be people. The only clean areas in the store was right after you checked out in the food court, bakery, lobby area. We wanted to love this place, so it could be our new market to get all of our asian food groceries, sadly this will bot be our place.<//review>

We get the 40 pound box of chicken when they go on sale for 20 bucks... And this week we ate a porterhouse for less than 6 bucks! 😁 Their organic produce is good also and have a"real" fish market, like Seattle's Pike's market.... But they don't yell and throw the fish...lol<//Review>

This store has something for everyone. Rice, noodles, meats, Couque D'Asse.  What's Couque D'Asse? It's the thing when you get a fingerling cookie and put something inside of it. Usually a cream filling. Sometimes it's sweet, sometimes it's salty. Normally it depends on what the package handler has eaten recently.
Srsly though, this place is great. About half of it is an Asian supermarket that can fly with the best of them. The remaining other half-ish is comprised of worldly foods. The former Soviet Bloc food section and selections  are surprisingly nice.  Not like a surprise Couque D'Asse. One is never prepared for a surprise Couque D'Asse.
7/7, would recommend to anybody!</Review>

<name>Smitten Kitten< /name><text>I have a love-hate relationship with this market.  You can't beat the selection and variety of ethnic foods (watch your prices) and the meat and seafood prices are competitive and product great quality...until you have to ask for help at the butcher counter.  :-( The checkout lines are more like a free-for-all with customers pushing in and being rude.  The design I am sure, is to prevent thieves from running out, but it's a bottle neck when they are busy, which seems to be always.<//text><gmap_id>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff< /gmap_id>< Response>

<Name>Cordellia Nguyen</Name><Text>I’m writing to put in a complaint about how one of your employees handle your “no outside food or drink rules.” I had a drink in my hand going to the store at the grocery end of the mart as I’m not familiar with the area and this is my first time at the store. One of the security guard, an African American man grabbed me, separated me from my family, and led me back to the entrance. He refused to let me talk to my family who was unaware of what was going on. He pointed to the sign at the lower left corner of the door and accused me saying that I didn’t know how to read. He then refused to let me in so I could get the car key from my family to put my drink back in my car. He basically argued that I need to finish my drink outside before I could go in or leave my drink on the ledge. He then went on a ramble and started to accuse me of not knowing how to read  and that the mart has the right to refuse service, in front of everyone. I’m displeased as to how he handled the situation and basically insulted me with his words and attitude treating me like I’m some thief.  I totally agree and respect the store rules. However, as an educated person, I find that he  has offended me based on his conduct and attitude. I hope that you address this situation so that no other customer would suffer from this insult.</Text><user_id>115812201827187807943<//user_id><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Won't let you in without both a mask AND gloves, gloves have been proven to do more bad than good with how people are leaving them on and touching everything or just littering them all over the ground. Company isn't actually worried about their employees, just following stupid guidelines made by stupid people. Won't be returning during or after the quarantine<//Text>

<Review>Easily one of the most impressive and diverse International Markets that I've ever been.

Also, top notch food court at the far end, with just about anything you could want.</Review><user>101982210872255006506</user><Rating>5< /Rating><time>1583164389399< /time><gmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff<//gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<text>So this place has everything...  random spice from India... sure, Canned goods from  Poland..yes indeed, Russian candy, meats and string cheese .. yep! Belgian chocolate or Fruits I have only seen on TV ... they have that too. The grains from any Asian region... just ask! A frozen foods section that is bigger than average grocery store,  a seafood counter with more sea products than anywhere in the area.... So many Knickknacks I am afraid to ask the purpose of...   fresh produce that is really good and cheaper than anywhere else...  Oh and booze!!!! ... So much booze from around the world!<//text>< pictures>

<review>This has been my childhood store since I was 15. I love this store. It has many different international ingredients that you wouldn't naturally get in some common grocery stores. They have a lot of Korean foods, Japanese foods, and etc. They have a food court and Korean BBQ place in the store. As well as a cosmetics store and a boba place. It has a lot more stuff that you are able to get other than regular stores.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff< /GmapID></record>

BEWARE before you go to this store. They are requiring customers to wear gloves, which is Not required the the Sacramento County Health Department Nor The CDC...Gloves if not used properly is actually Re-contamination of everything you touch !!! Do Your Research People !!< /Text>

There was a door Nazi who yelled at me and my kids for exiting through the wrong door.  Apparently it was just an entrance, not an exit.  The exit was far away from where I parked, and my child was in crutches, but did that matter?  Nope!  He just kept yelling.  What customer service!  The place was crowded, noisy, and most of the produce was rotten.  I wouldn’t go here again.  I don’t even think this place deserves a star.<//text>< user_name>

This place truly does care about the Covid-19 situation.this is the only place that I have been to that has many layers of protection for their customers.

Yes, it is kind of a pain in the butt trying to enter the store but it is for everyone's protection.<//review>

I love KP International Market! This is your one stop grocery store if you need ethnic ingredients to make ethnic foods at a reasonably low price! The checkout lines can be long especially during the dinner rush, but the variety of items in stock make the rush worth it!<//text>

just went there today as of May 22 around 5pm
.
there was a line to get in but it was quick, like no wait. as your in line, you have to put on disposable gloves which is provided and a mask is required which u need to have on and mask is not supplied. after gloves are on they provide hand sanitzer which needs to be used with gloves on.
.
as your inside the place recommend you to social distance and don't get to close to customers or workers.
.
overall experience I feel safe to go inside and shop. and the food court is still opened but oy togo only.<//review>

The best store in the world there are snacks and ingredients from every country. You can literally find everything from fresh produce to Japanese soda to food court pastries.oh yeah and there's a good court. They also have cooking utensils and containers and skin care and toiletries from many countries so there is anything you want<//Review>

Market was pretty busy but we really appreciated how it was required that EVERYONE wear gloves and masks. Even a glove and sanitatizing stand were provided before entering.

Great grocery and food selection. Love the euro snacks and groceries. Food court food was to go only, and the Korean fast food is super good, especially the Yukaejang. But the Bibim Naengmyun is not great, just meh.</Review>

Honestly the Disneyland of international food. We come here just to walk around some times, and we always leave with something new and interesting. It is the guaranteed spot for hard to find international ingredients.< /text>

just went there today as of May 22 around 5pm
.
there was a line to get in but it was quick, like no wait. as your in line, you have to put on disposable gloves which is provided and a mask is required which u need to have on and mask is not supplied. after gloves are on they provide hand sanitzer which needs to be used with gloves on.
.
as your inside the place recommend you to social distance and don't get to close to customers or workers.
.
overall experience I feel safe to go inside and shop. and the food court is still opened but oy togo only.<//Review>

<Review>This market has the widest selection of international goods I've ever seen. Easily the size of two groceries, and half of that is entirely Korean and Japanese goods. The other side of the store has a vast selection of fresh meats, fish, and cheeses, as well as other import goods from other countries. They also have an international food court with tons of different things to choose from!< /Review>< pictures>

This is a double-sized super market with groceries from all over the world but especially from Asia.  This is an excellent market to get hard-to-find items from Korea,   China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.  KP Market is especially strong in produce and seafood.</review>

Extraordinary unique business in Rancho Cordova. KP International has foods from around the world with a delicious food court. Not only do they have a food court but they also have a Karaoke spot that you can order drinks and food at and Billards as well. Definitely a unique place and a wonderful addition to Rancho.<//Text>

They've got all kinds of food stuff here. Korean, Hispanic, Arabic, Russian. Fresh produce, tons of frozen stuff from all over the world, rows and rows of shelves. Kimchi, fresh bread,  all kinds of noodles from Japan, Korea, Thailand, etcAnd customers from everywhere speaking all kinds of languages. This is truly an amazing place to wander around and try something new.
Did I mention the food court? They have that too, and my family likes the fresh OJ< /text>

Such a great place with so many options like groceries from Russia, Mexico, Philippines, China, etc. With a food court, bakery, hot food, karaoke, bar, and billiards. They thought of everything. Decent prices on meat too.<//text>

My family and I shop here every one and awhile since KP is roughly about a 40 minutes drive for us. Of all the times that we’ve been here we usually have a pleasant experience. (The cashiers and workers don’t greet or anything though which is fine.) Never question their meat department until a couple weeks ago when a LIVE crawfish fell on the ground - on the customer’s end - and we inform the meat workers and he just causally picks it up and threw it over back in the pile. And mind you, they were cleaning and mopping that day too. Not sure how the meat process works if it comes prepackage or if it’s butchered there but I question my meat purchases now.

Other than that I do enjoy their bakery selection and the variety’s of culture food they offer.< /Text>

Great place to shop for specialty foods/ingredients. Very wide range of international foods. Great place to find any hard to find spice or ingredient that you cant find in your local grocery store. Also huge selection of produce. They also make thier own fresh tortillas/chips daily. I go for a great selection of honey.</Text>

They have employees at a sanitizing station outside the entrance. The employees have no clue that they are spreading germs, bacteria, and viruses with their handling of sanitized materials. Saw the sanitizer employee, touch the uncovered table 8 times, his pants twice, the sanitizer solution bottle 4 times, his mask twice, then without switching gloves or anything else reach in and touch all the different sized gloves,  and then the masks. Again, without ever changing his own ppe after exposing them to the stuff they are trying to prevent. Wouldn't let me in the store, when I asked him to change his own ppe, before touching the ones he wanted me to wear.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

They've got all kinds of food stuff here. Korean, Hispanic, Arabic, Russian. Fresh produce, tons of frozen stuff from all over the world, rows and rows of shelves. Kimchi, fresh bread,  all kinds of noodles from Japan, Korea, Thailand, etcAnd customers from everywhere speaking all kinds of languages. This is truly an amazing place to wander around and try something new.
Did I mention the food court? They have that too, and my family likes the fresh OJ</text>

<text>Great place to score deals and harder to find international items. Know your prices though, some things aren't competitively priced. Also definitely be picky and plan on using it quickly when buying their produce. It is always such a good price for a reason. It never lasts long.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

They have everything! Careful with meat purchases. Specifically beef. In order to keep their costs down they buy a cheaper cut of beef than most grocery stores.  Instead of prime you get "choice". Therefore you really have to ensure enough marbling is in meat or slow cook in a liquid base. I HAVE been able to get good cuts but ya have to really look or go somewhere else.< /review>

Love this place. The baklava is affordable, authentic and delicious, and if you need damn near ANYTHING, they have it. Russian, Polish, Ukrainian Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, if grandma had a receipe, or if you had one before moving to the states, this store has it. Fresh baked breads, pitas, etc. Even good affordable kitchenware. Go here, it's worth the drive. Happy cooking everyone!<//review>

I was unable to find what i came here for.  Staff unfamiliar with product locations. After one employee was semi kind enough to walk me over to what he said was the correct isle, another customer called me a foreigner, laughed and walk way.  FOREIGNER!! I was the one born here.  To be called a foreigner on AMERICAN SOIL, so rude and disrespectful.  Will not shop here again.</text>< pics>

Their food court and bakery are pretty awesome, as is their selection of meat and fish. It might seem a little intimidating at first, but I've had nothing but positive experiences with the staff answering any questions I may have.<//Text>< Name>

Large, with good selection. The produce isn't very fresh, but it's very cheap. It's perfect if you plan on cooking them within a day or two. Also, there's about 30 aisles of packaged foods and condiments, so if you need anything Asian, you'll most likely find it. Also, it's grouped by country, which makes shopping for a specific recipe much easier than some other places that just group like with like.<//Review>

The staff leave much to be desired in the way of common courtesy and equality. I've come here frequently, as much of my cooking requires what are considered hard to find ingredients in Sacramento. One thing I noticed is that there seems to be a subtle undercurrent of racism amongst certain employees. My best guess is that the gap is due to a difference in linguistic familiarity....if you speak the same dialect, you'll probably get a friendly reception aiming to build rapport. On the other hand, failure to do so seems to elicit coldness and a dismissive attitude. I love the multicultural groceries they offer, but this feeling I get is really awkward. It's like I'm an unwanted pet or guest. I consider myself a gentleman, and always do my best to conduct my behavior as such, but these trivialities don't have any bearing on how I'm treated. Additionally, the food court has markedly declined. One of their best restraunts closed, and the other 3 don't offer anything worth what they charge. For these reasons, and much mote, 2 stars is being generous.</Review>

<review>I want to preface my review by saying that I love the actual grocery store/market. However, the KP International food court is a joke. The food is all bland and tastes like they reheat it all in the back.

The MOST AGGRIVATING ASPECT of the food court is the HORRIBLE costumer service. I mean I've eaten here less then 5 times and have heard agruments with the costumers with the staff half the time. I never believed it would happen to me until today where the Korean place gave us the wrong order but absolutely would not take it back to give us what we actually ordered because we had already taken it from the counter. We literally didn't touch the food  and took it back 30 seconds after we got it from the counter! I wouldn't really care about this because mistakes happen but the way the cashier rudely talked down to me as if I did something wrong is absolutely not the way to treat a costumer.

If you're hungry and considering the KP International food court, do yourself a favor and go to any of the better restaurants down the street. The food will taste way more and flavorful and authentic. The price will  be similar but other restaurants will have wayyy better costumer service.</review></record></dataset><record>

I love this place. It has everything to Korean food to different cuts of meat for Korean Barbecue. The building looks small from the outside but once you go inside, its big. I've been buying meats and ingredients for Korean Barbecue. Also, bread as well. I bought Gold N Fresh for the past year or so and I tried a new bakery bread. Called Pampangas Bakery. Their bread is way better than Gold N Fresh and other filipino bakery that is in Sacramento.<//Review>

This supermarket is by far the best in the Sacramento area to find Asian ingredients. On top of that, they have other select stuff from all over the world. I spend hours in this place every time I visit. After you're done shopping, there are some restaurants inside that serve a variety of foods. It's really an experience outside of regular supermarket shopping.</review>

<review>Crazy amazing selection in foreign foods. From Asian, Middle Eastern, European, Hispanic and more. Fruit and veg section is awesome in selection. Regular good deals on meat prices and you can ask the butchers for specific cuts at times (had them cut me 2+ in. Porterhouses on more than one occasion). Fish section again has large variety of both filleted and live stock tanked fish. Deli has numerous exotic fares. Drink section is extensive. Also has a bakery, food court, liquor section and Korean BBQ. Great place, but expect to spend waaaay more than intended due to splurging. You've been warned lol.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I truly appreciate this place! “The place” to get all your seafood needs and more! They carry all kinds of things from different Asian culture, their noodle selection is unbelievable! I also love how fresh their sea foods and meat are. Great place to eat and relax, it’s all in one location. Also staff are friendly. Definitely my favorite market ❤️< /Review>

Best place for international foods and goods. The store itself has tripled in size from the first time I came for Asian food, looks really nice and has some nice additions from back then. Wish they still played Korean pop in the store, also it was nice having Korean dramas being played in the dinning area. The video section in the front was also welcoming which all of the above is missing now, maybe it can be brought back? ( ;D wink wink) besides those things that are missing from before, this is a really nice place to find some good stuff, and the dinning area also has a variety of choices depending on what your hungry for. They are still expanding to make the store even better, I can’t wait to see what is next!< /text>

I was so excited when I found this store, they have everything!!! I have a few favorite dishes that are from other countries kinds of food that I am always on the lookout for, well search no more!!! They had every single thing that I have been looking for for a number of years as well as some other beautiful items that I had to get that weren't food items. There were so many things that I was  there for a couple of hours and still had only seen portions of the store. I will definitely be returning there and with a shopping list this time. Definitely recommend checking it !</review>

After shopping the market, you have to visit the FOOD court. FOOD was tasty, but the best part was watching the international prank show while enjoying an inexpensive quick bite.<//text>

Great place to buy international groceries from primarily Asian countries. They also have food from Russia, Eastern and Western Europe and more.  Fantastic produce and meat/seafood areas.  Also have a bakery, food court, liquor store, jewelery store, and restaurants.  Staff is helpful.  Also can find the small kitchen appliances, accessories, and other helpful and useful items that are often found in Asian grocery stores.</Text>

So many options on foods around the world. Some items are a great price. Foods around the world are higher in the specific countries but you don't have to travel to get regional foods.

<Review>Love this plaza! Its becoming its own little center with a mulitcultural food market, karaoke bar, Asian restaurant, Nature Republic (skincare store),  food court, and coming soon a spa treatment center. The service is always great, never a problem that wasn't quickly rectified. It's always busy during the day but the lines move fast.</Review>< pics>

< review>
This was my first time to the international market and I was really excited to see so many new and different foods and grocery items available for such reasonable prices... Also I'm excited about the seafood and butcher selections... Bought two nice big halibut steaks for only $20 last week which would normally be closer to 50 and it was absolutely amazing... highly recommend

July 2018 update.... the seafood several times since my last review however I have to disclose that the last two times I had halibut in the salmon it had numerous worms in it... The hell of it had red worms the same and has white worms it really freaked me out... The last time I saw worms in Market Fish was about 12 years ago when I had red snapper to Safeway... I realize bottom feeders will tend to have worms but I believe that a proper fishmonger or store will do candling and remove most of the worms when possible these worms are on the surface and obviously had not been candled or physically checked.... I took out the worms as best I could from the halibut and cooked it extra long two temperature that would kill them however I only ate a little bit and me and my son both had stomach aches later although I never told him about the worms my stomach hasn't seemed right for about a week after eating it so I don't think I'll eat the fish there again... I did call them and brought it to their attention in the fish department said they had never seen worms ever ever on their fish which to me sounds not accurate cuz we all know fish has worms in it from time to time I left a message for the manager to call me back and he never called me back... I contacted health department and they indicated that worms will have fish on them and it's not a health violation but rather a customer service issue... I found that strange as I saw many news articles about Costco fish having worms in the health department shutting them down so not really clear about this but I'm not comfortable buying Seafood there any longer... Although I did read you can soak it in cold water and when I did that with the salmon the worms did come out but again I think I prefer to buy wild-caught frozen fish from now on so I don't have to deal with worms.... if anyone has any other feedback I love to hear it because I was so excited about the great tasting seafood at great prices< /review>

I do have some concerns about the Blue Corner (they make drinks) though, the taste is inconsistent, sometimes it's good sometimes it isn't. I thought they'd have the proportions down by now.</Review>< Pictures>

I went to the store 5 min before closed and just had to get one item. When I arrived the security was at the door and did not want to let me in I showed him the time  And told him I just needed to get one item. he closed the door on my face extremely rude and didn’t say anything. I won’t ever be going to this place again! I was also a regular shopper ! Fire that security guard horrible lazy customer service I also drove almost 45 min to go to the store for them to just close the door on my face is so not right especially if it wasn’t even 10!!!< /review>

<Review>This supermarket is great I like it a lot but it has a very big flaw 1 of the employees that work outside the shopping mall go several times that we have seen it myself and my family that is in a gray car having sex with another guy, the bad Apart from the fact that it is a very bad image for the supermarket, he realizes that people pass by and do nothing about it. It is a thick brown gentleman with a mustache. Thank you, I hope you change it or at least it catches your attention.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Great place to shop for imported food.  Mostly Oriental, but a good assortment of eastern Euopean as well.  The produce isle includes locally grown yet unusual fruits and vegetables.

The food court has two food bars.  One with sushi & Korean selections and the other has "Americanized" oriental & Mexican.  Plus a Korean restaurant.

Other related shopping includes oriental kitchen pots & gadgets.< /review>< Pictures>

When I arrived the security was at the door and did not want to let me in I showed him the time  And told him I just needed to get one item. he closed the door on my face extremely rude and didn’t say anything. I won’t ever be going to this place again! I was also a regular shopper ! Fire that security guard horrible lazy customer service I also drove almost 45 min to go to the store for them to just close the door on my face is so not right especially if it wasn’t even 10!!!<//Text><name>Ivan Tsurkan</name><rating>1<//rating><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

This grocery store is the best!  If you're looking for ethnic foods that you cannot find elsewhere, this is the place to go.  Their food court options are plentiful as well.</text>

Too large to cover in short time.  Need to go back few more times to get familiar with the store. The Cara-cara orange molded after two days, the rest tasted like they been in a rotten storage (over ripe and in box too long). Some vegetables were ok,.  Went to get Korean hot pepper powder, have not use that yet.  Overall a good market.</review>

<review>I come for their Russian piroshki at 2.50 a pop. They are huge, tasty, and well filled. But I also come for the great deals on other shopping as well. It's a great place to find things that you didn't know about or find things at a discounted price.</review>< response>

<review>The produce selection is enormous. And the prices are moderate. Lots of exotic (to most Americans) fruits and vegetables. The first visit is likely to be overwhelming. Once you get familiar with the store, it's fun to shop there. I recommend that you wear comfortable shoes because you will be walking a lot.< /review>< user_name>

Honestly the best international store around for many miles. They have some of the best prices for fruits and veggies. Not always quality but when your cooking with it, it doesn't need to look perfect.

The clearance bin is a hit or miss depending on day but always interesting to look through. They have a pretty good selection of products for a wide variety of nations. Japanese, Korean, Indian, philipino, Russian, European etc....

They have a rewards system that you can sign up for. A dollar earns you a point that is worth about a penny towards their food court.

Speaking of which, they also have a nice variety when it comes to their food court. Burgers, hotdogs, Vietnamese pho and Bahn mi, Mexican food, Japanese sushi and bentos, Korean dishes, etc..... There are lots of tables to eat as well as a large screen with a projector that plays some funny prank show.

During the holiday season they have free picture taking with an Easter Bunny or santa. Not sure about other holidays.  Very well done for a free photo. Lastly the staff is always friendly and tries to be helpful. I say try because they don't always communicate well. Overall, one of my favorite places to shop.< /text>

<user_name>Billy Saetern</user_name><text>Honestly the best international store around for many miles. They have some of the best prices for fruits and veggies. Not always quality but when your cooking with it, it doesn't need to look perfect.

The clearance bin is a hit or miss depending on day but always interesting to look through. They have a pretty good selection of products for a wide variety of nations. Japanese, Korean, Indian, philipino, Russian, European etc....

They have a rewards system that you can sign up for. A dollar earns you a point that is worth about a penny towards their food court.

Speaking of which, they also have a nice variety when it comes to their food court. Burgers, hotdogs, Vietnamese pho and Bahn mi, Mexican food, Japanese sushi and bentos, Korean dishes, etc..... There are lots of tables to eat as well as a large screen with a projector that plays some funny prank show.

During the holiday season they have free picture taking with an Easter Bunny or santa. Not sure about other holidays.  Very well done for a free photo. Lastly the staff is always friendly and tries to be helpful. I say try because they don't always communicate well. Overall, one of my favorite places to shop.</text><Date>1578211436619< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Fun store. Like a visit to a foreign country. Lots of interesting food. There's a fish monger with lots of choices and good prices. I like looking at the teas, candies, cheezes. For meat eaters there are lots of sausages to choose from. Good selection of produce with good prices.<//Text>

A lot of good items. Best asian grocery store. A little hight on regular items. But good in items that you can't find anywhere else. Also the food pavillion is good. We order mexican food. Carnitas fries and a carnitas plate. The plates were big. I should had take a picture but I was hungry. 🤣🤣🤣 next time.< /text>

Masks are still required, and gloves too. It takes a lot of freaking time. Not to mention the check out lines.</review>

This food court does have an international selection of meals.
We always opt for the seafood and veggie ones as we do not eat meat.
The food is always hot and well seasoned. We go to the Korean section. There is something for everyone's palate and judging from the international customers that always eat here, they must be doing something right.
Whether you eat here before or after doing your groceries or just come to eat like we do sometimes, you will always leave with a satisfied craving.<//review>

I wish I live closer to KP plaza.  The food court is amazing with great variety of selections.  I love getting my bento box with grilled salmon and the seafood noodle bowl.   I was surprised to fine a vegetarian plate for my mom.  I am glad they have hot dogs and fries for my son.< /Review>

Hope that there would be more organic options are available.
Pros:  it is pretty clean and no fishy odor.
Cons:  not much fresh organic options.<//Text>

<text>There is the most comprehensive selection for any home cook to be found. My only reason for four out of five stars is price. Across the board there are few areas they are competitive in pricing. Retail costs similar to Raley's and sometimes as high as Whole Foods. Produce and fish quality are well worth that price however packaged goods with high preservatives levels and long shelf life are priced much higher than market. However the selection all Under One Roof does mollify the most visceral argument for the high cost.</text>< Resp>

Some of the food in there is what you could find in any grocery store, however there's a ton of stuff from International purveyors that hasn't even changed the labeling, so much so that in some cases you can't even tell what it is. But that's the fun of it. They also have a pretty good-sized food court, yes it feels grimy and depressing, but the Price Is Right In Like I said it's a funky joint. They even have an old school Lounge alla 1970s in there. Karaoke and cheesy pick up lines anyone?</Review><Rating>4< /Rating>< Pictures>

There is a tremendous diversity of food from different continents and different countries, but primarily from Asia. Fruits and vegetables are cheaper than at Walmart, but some are worse by the quality. They suggest Reward Points Card for free to accrue points. You can redeem them at their Food Court.< /Review>

It’s a good place to get watermelon with seeds during the watermelon season. Other than buying the hard-to-find seeded watermelon I wouldn’t go to the place. I really hate the layout of the store. The aisles are narrow, congestion happens often. And the check out is far from the entry.<//Text>

I really like this place, huge selection of veggies and Asian goods, fish can be questionable at times but overall is decent! Just make sure you check the gills and the eyes for freshness. We go twice a month to replenish our fridge.

HOWEVER, The food court is absolute garbage, it is difficult to understand how a human being can create such a tasteless pile of food, worst Chinese food in Sacramento, the Korean seafood bowl had nothing to do with the picture and for your safety I would not recommend to eat.

One more thing, do not buy fish with the sale label. Guaranteed food poisoning.

Go tell your moms.< /Text>

Good deals on meat and produce (although some produce should be used quickly) . . . Lots of international brands.  I shop there myself because it is less expensive than shopping at the big brand supermarkets :)<//Text>

Great store, I could spend hours in there just looking at all the different sauces, drinks,  and noodles. If you're looking for something specific or hard to find they probably have it. Staff are also friendly and welcoming.<//Text>

Place is heavily patrol by security guard. Food selection is ok. Seating is abundant but tight. Utinsil are readily available for grab. Self serve, prices are too high especially for this type of atmosphere.. lines are all over the place, don't know who's in line or not. Only recommend is if you're really hungry or just need to grab something to eat then this will suffice.</text>

Love the atmosphere and the food at  BBQ place has a variety of yummy dishes. However, I don't recommend La Fonda or Delicatessen! The food is old & bland not freshly made. I didn't even eat what I bought I was very disappointed.< /review>

< Review>
Overall, I love this place. Excellent produce selection as well as a wide variety of ethnic products that aren't commonly stocked at other stores. Can't beat the price on the produce and many of the everyday items are reasonably priced as well. Meat and deli department also have a terrific selection and extremely competitive pricing. The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because some of their items are horribly overpriced. Items like salad dressing, detergent, etc. are almost twice what you would pay in other stores. However, they are also very conveniently located next to Target, Walmart, and many other stores so it's easy to pop into another place for the items that are overpriced at KP.<//Review>

< Review>
The market gets 5 stars, the hot food section gets -3...

The market has an incredible selection of foods you would have difficulties find anywhere else. Their selection of slavic foods is good. Their mainland asian and pacific island selection even better. The produce is mostly fresh and prices are reasonable. Their frozen choices are great.

The hot food section has interesting choices, most of which are priced a little too high. Not much, just enough to be annoying. Here is where the service is lacking. You cannot simply get a small cup of water to go with your meal. When I asked, I was directed to a vending machine to buy a bottle of water.

What the...

The price wasn't bad, but the bottle was room temperature. Look, a family who has small children doesn't necessarily want to buy soda for them. The cost of the food should cover a small cup of water.

Not having water is not good customer service.

I am going to use the market. I'll be dammed if I ever use the food court again...<//Review>

I'm from Hawaii and this place reminded me of home. They had thing from Hawaii that I couldn't find anywhere in California and the price was reasonable. From fresh fish to freash vegetable this store has everything and more. The best part about it all is after you are done shopping the food court has a wide selection of food. There's some Korean, Chinese, Japanese Vietnamese, Thai and American food every one can get what they want.</Text>

Best place to buy affordable Asian noodles! I love the spicy noodles and this is the only place that sells it at an affordable price! I also love the dumplings they sell which are so cheap and don’t get me started on the seaweed lavers! There’s no place like KP Market!<//text>

Best place to get oriental goods, european deli,Hispanic goodies, seafoods-live fish and crabs. Personally i like the Wide variety of fruits and vegetables. I always check their mushroom section, they got different kinds. They got frozen good from different countries.
They also have a bakery and several restaurants inside the building. If you are into karaoke stop by during their happy hours.<//Text>

I have never seen so much cultural diversity in a market. From Russian food to any and all Asian foods, along with a tortillaria. Fresh fish market. They have food court style restaurants as well as a quiet and cozy sit down restaurant.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

<Review>Always have enjoyed shopping here. KP market carries a very wide of choices -- Japanese and Korean noodles, spices and sauces. All sorts of Frozen and fresh sea food.

The bakery section has regular bread, Mexican tortia, middle eastern pita bread and everything conceivable.

The spices section same, spices from around the world.

Our favorite, beet juice from Georgia and Slavania, pickled and fermented foods from all over Europe.

The produce section has vegetables for Asian -- Chinese brocallie, Okinawan potatoes,... Korean reddish,... Including all regular items such as tomato, bell peppers, lemon,..

Just a delight to see wonderful selection from all over the world.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Kp is a great store for finding all those weird ingredients you need. It has pretty much everything! I have been shopping here for a long time and have never had any issues, except for today, and I won't be shopping here any longer.

I bought a boba smoothie from the food court and then proceeded to the other side of the store to get a cart and do my shopping. When I went outside to get a cart I was told I cannot bring food in the store.

The sign on the door says no OUTSIDE food or drink, and I had bought the smoothie literally a couple minutes prior inside the store. I pointed this out to the security guy and he said "too bad, it doesn't matter." I pointed out to him again that the sign says outside food and drink and he again said too bad and pointed to the sign that says "we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone"

Honestly it wouldn't have even bothered me that much if he had cared to be even somewhat polite. I asked a cashier inside if I could speak to a manager and she acted like I had just asked the hardest thing in the world. I told her what I wanted to talk to the manager about and she told me to go talk to security.

Thanks a lot lol. This store has never had good customer service and it has never bothered me, but these two employees are the reason I won't be returning.

If you don't mind being treated badly, it's a great store.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I always love coming here! I like to explore new foods and cultures and what other great way to do it, other than diving in and doing it yourself? (There is always the options of having a guide, but I don't have one.)

It doesn't mattering you're just looking for the broth your mother used to use or if you are trying new flavors, KP has you covered. Not all the prices are competitive, so if you know where to get your deals, do so. Seeing as how I've not fou mbv d a more comprehensive, multicultural grocery store, I don't mind getting everything from here.

Weather it's a random adventure, or you are a regular, come in and look around. Try to find something you've never th tried before.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This is one of my favorite grocers for the variety of food, both Asian and American, and for their amazing food court, bakery, and other restaurant/eatery option. Their meat department is also very diversive, ranging from chicken thighs to cow tongues, to fresh fish/crab that were just swimming in their tanks.</Review>

First time here.  It was fun walking through all the aisles.  We had some trouble finding something specific.  Asking for help didn't work since the few gentlemen I asked didn't know what I was asking for.  They tried though, and I found what I was looking for!  The food court items looked delicious so we'll be back again.<//Text>

<review>Large store with a wide variety of food. They have fresh seafood and produce, as well as food from many different countries around the world. The food court also has a great selection of dishes from around the world. My favorite are the pho dishes, potato twists, and boba milk tea. Would recommend to anyone looking for a neat experience.< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>The beef bibimbop, japchae and tteokbokki  is delicious, but low key people are asleep on their Mexican food offerings. The pork in green chili sauce ( puerco en salsa verde) is delicious! If you shop in the grocery department, you can earn points too towards the food court purchases.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Not a fan. These places freak me out as they literally smell inside I think from old rotting meat. I want to buy my meat from a place that is cleaner and does not stink.  Overall if you look closely the entire store is filthy< /Text>

Pro:  Clean and well stocked.  Has a food court and adjoining Korean restaurant.

Con:  hard to find things.  Not organized well and isle signs don't help much.  Entrance is on only one side of building and exit on the opposite end. (Pretty big building too).  Best to park near the exit and not the entrance.  Most staff are in-personal and seem irritated, especially if you ask any questions.<//review>

Rudeness from the security at the door. Don't bring a drink in the store unless you want to treated like a criminal. Was told by a very rude security guard to either put drink in car or take it to the  security desk. They take this drink thing seriously. I opted to take it to the security desk. (Curiosity and it was hot outside) those security people were very nice. So I checked my drink in. Lol. This experience was not very good this time. Been coming here for years and today was a bit much</review>

Lots of foreign food that you definitely won't find in Walmart. Also got a food court where you can eat and lounge for a minute. Prices on the higher side of the spectrum.<//review>

I really like KP but can only give 3 stars for the lack of customer service skills and mediocre produce. Customer service means a lot to me. I really like KP for the wide variety they maintain and shop there occasionally  to stock up as needed. Usually I know what I'm looking for. However today I wanted to try a recipe with special ingredients I went to KP for. Couldn't find what I needed and didn't get help despite the seriously confused look on my face and asking for help that directed me to an isle #. I came in grabbing a cart but promised myself if I couldn't find what I mainly needed, I'd by nothing and try somewhere else. I left with nothing.
Maybe employees should be trained to not only be ready to assist customers but also look out for those looking confused. It goes a long way to help someone unexpectedly and actually take them to their area of need - especially when the customer's native tongue is English and the items available are mostly in different languages.<//Text>

The Korean stall at the KP international food court is a very good place have tasty food. I had beef bone cabbage soup and it was very delicious. Probably it was much better than Yukkaejang. They provide only 2 banchans, but it's fine as I'm more interested in the main dish. BTW, this review is not for the Red Alcove restaurant that's just next to it.< /Review>

The food is not really authentic korean food but okay overall. The customer service suck. Online food court is supposed to open at 1030am but the lady opened it at 11. Then when i went to ask what i want, she say for the jajamyeon it wont be available until 1130am like brooo we waited since 1030 and you guys ate not even all ready yet???< /Review>

Has almost all of the Asian stuff that you would ever need, even had a ktv and food court attached.

Would not recommend their "fresh seafood" over ice, they're never really fresh, the live ones on the tank are okay.< /text>

It's so much fun to just be in the store. There are so many things you can get from this store. The main products you can get are, of course Korean foods. We always get a big bin of Kimchee. Their price for Kimchee cannot be beat.
We also get prepared Korean foods like seaweed salad, radish Kimchee, etc.
They have Japanese foods as well. We get Japanese seasonings such as Dashi (Bonito soup base, ) hot pot soup base, and hurikake (rice seasoning flakes.)
They have sample stations and their sample foods are always so delicious that it is guaranteed to make me want to purchase the foods. The sample ladies are always nice and friendly.
I wish this place was closer to where I live.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I wish I can give them negative 5 stars. These guys are not honest and they just scan your most expensive items TWICE!

That's correct, they did this many times, a lot of my friends and neighbors got this. Some of them found out immediately and most of them noticed after they got home. They did this systematically! About 2 weeks ago, my friend went to this market to buy a few times less than $10, they still add an non-existing time to mark up by $2.

Avoid these guys!</Review>< pics>

I'd stick to their groceries, their kimba is pretty good. Slightly over priced groceries but the venue and less ghetto location then alternatives like 99 ranch and other asian stores. Edit: paid 8 dollars for stale rich and over sauced meat, waited longer because we ate here instead of to go. If you want your food at any reasonable time say your not eating there.</Review>< gmap_id>

Great Korean food supplies, looking for Asian food items, Russian food, Ukrainian food, plus fresh tortillas in the Hispanic section. This is an international food store, it's HUGE!!!! This is not a quick visit place , way way too much to see!!! Seafood is fresh and still alive. Food courts are delish, Korean food court is authentic! Bakery is crazy full of goodies, along with giant fresh pretzels, and all kinds of piroshki's European breads, cookies. Boboa drink bar, giant snowcones! Korean cosmetic store and Korean sit down restraunt.< /review>

Last week I went with my entire family to shop at this place. I was setting in the   Accessible car . My husband told me to hold the kid let me go get milk. I was waiting for my husband to come.  Security guard came and told me to move out of the car and move your kid.  I apologize him I said I waiting for my husband so he could take the kid then I will go and check out.  Meanly came to my face and told me Look man you need to move out of the car.  I said my back is hurting I have to sit in this car.  While he was so rude to me my son was crying so much so I gave my son to hold on to the candy bar,  while waiting for my husband.  Security guard came again close to my face said do not open the candy.  And I said sir what’s your problem why you been so route we are customer you shouldn’t treat us like garbage.  He came to and jump to my face, then I start crying front of everyone I feel embarrassed.  We called the manager He didn’t even apologize just keep quiet and shake his head.  I know this place has everything you need fresh produce  fresh food but the management and the people that work there it’s horrible and have no personality specially the security guard.  I would never go to this place again in my life.  And I would never recommend this place to anyone and I will stop my entire family to go there too.<//review>

< Review>
They have a covered lady at the cashier by the name of Maryum. She was an unfriendly from the minute we saw her. Seems this nut job could not smile. Absolute moron who even mumbled something to me which I asked her what she said her reply was "Nothing" when I asked her what she mumbled. We usually shop at this location but will never shop again. The Asian cashiers at this store are much friendlier.

Also the meat we bought from this store made the whole family get the runs. Avoid buying meat from this place. If you plan on buying bread also make sure its not expired.<//Review>

I love KPI! This place is a cook's dream! If you're looking for a huge variety of inexpensive produce this is the place.They also have 1.5 aisles of greens (pea shoots, asian chives++), fresh peas & garbanzos, banana flowers, bok choy (& its ten cousins). Add to that a wall+ of spices & herbs (a couple fresh, the rest dried). Frozen fish & seafood, 6 kinds of tofu, frozen shao mae, fresh & frozen noodles. They just started carrying high quality frozen Indian foods & breads (including 25 packs of frozen paratha. There's tons of frozen foods, like gyoza (chicken, pork, veggies, & combos), AND lumpia...

Let's make this easier: This place is FULL of all kinds of:
• Asian food supplies (like an aisle of soy sauce. Plus prefab tamarind sauce & other Asian sauces;
• Some basic American staples (milk, juices, cheeses, deli meats);
• Some Eastern European (desserts, sausages, pastas & cheeses);
• Hispanic food supplies (canned & dry ingredients and a Tortilleria);
• Fresh meats (all kinds) & seafood.

● EXCEPT for fresh East Indian paneer ●
I haven't found that...ONE...thing. Seriously.

There's also cookware & kitchen tools; sake sets; ramen bowls; an aisle of sauces & soups; tea; alcohol (beer & wine); soda, basic & household items (paper towels++).

OOPS I forgot that there's ALSO an Eastern European bakery; 3-4 cafeteria style restaurants; a jewelry store and a Bubble tea place. I hear they've got the best pho you can find. There's a lot of indoor seating for you to eat at & a gorgeous, waterfall-type fountain you can sit at & listen to it's hypnotic sound.

There's also the most aware, helpful & friendly Security team to keep an eye on you in the parking lot (ladies check out the Security guards cause some of them are HOT). The lot has video cameras too & beautiful lights in all the trees at the holidays. KP Billiards is next door with Manny at the cocktail bar.

Set aside 1-2 hours just to figure out that's in this MASSIVE store. It's open until 10:00PM on some nights.<//Text>

Huge plaza around the large central location of a large Pacific Asian/East Asian supermarket. I say Asian because it has more than just Korean specialties, but Japanese, Indian, and Hawaiian to name a few. The produce includes ingrediants you won't find at your local market, and the meat and fish from the butcher include cuts you won't find even at Seafood City.

The prices were.. understandable, but not cheap. Nothing to complain about when you can't get some items within litterally 100 miles of this place (or out of country).

As a bonus, there is a food court including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and American. Plenty of seating available and attached Korean karaoke, Korean BBQ, and bubble tea restaurants.

Truely a place worthy of 5 stars reviews and your patronage if you are in need of an Asian food fix.</Text>

KP Plaza is a wonderful place to find international food staples and specialty grocery items. Inside you will find fresh seafood, specialty cuts of meat, freshly made kimbap and they also have a section making fresh tortillas to take home.

The food court has Mexican, Chinese, Korean food and even has a pastry booth where you can buy a variety of sweets or savory pies to go.  If you would rather eat a little more upscale, you can chose to dine at the Red Alcove an excellant Korean BBQ place or sing karaoke at KP Karaoke both connected to the plaza.

Parking is easy and the Gold line light rail station is right outside making it a convenient stop.< /Review>

You can literally get anything here.  We love Koreans Plaza.  Traffic on the inside can be congested and confusing, I prefer shopping in the evening.  We made the mistake of shopping midday Saturday with one of the car carts this weekend and got stuck by the food samples for a while.  The tortillarilla seems to have been removed, which is unfortunate hopefully it will be back.  We have been shopping here since before the addition and I believe Koreana is better than ever.</text>

They have a great assortment of Asian foods and goods with a food court and a restaurant. The meats are not of great quality, but they do provide cuts that other supermarkets do not like LA Kalbi and bulgogi. Even if the prices were more expensive but the quality of meats were better, then I'd be happy pay it. But it's just better to go to Costco, Nugget or Coop to get better quality meats and fish.

The gallery is decent, but if you're offering Korean food, then maybe it should taste a little more authentic and less fast food-like. Also, maybe having Korean ajummas make the food rather than non-Asian cooks would imropve the quality and authenticity of the Korean food, considering it is a Korean market.</Text>

I had the worst experience. Ever in here. They were disrespectful and treated us rudely.  We paid our money to eat and get drinks and one of the security. Guards ( with no name tag) started telling us to leave because I made a mistake.  We pay money in here every day to be treated badly.  I hope the man who treated us like that gets put on leave cause no one deserves to be treated like that definitely a customer who comes in all the time. They treated us horribly because of soda. I will never ever come here again and I honestly don't recommend eating at there food court.</Text>

I love KPI! This place is a cook's dream! If you're looking for a huge variety of inexpensive produce this is the place.They also have 1.5 aisles of greens (pea shoots, asian chives++), fresh peas & garbanzos, banana flowers, bok choy (& its ten cousins). Add to that a wall+ of spices & herbs (a couple fresh, the rest dried). Frozen fish & seafood, 6 kinds of tofu, frozen shao mae, fresh & frozen noodles. They just started carrying high quality frozen Indian foods & breads (including 25 packs of frozen paratha. There's tons of frozen foods, like gyoza (chicken, pork, veggies, & combos), AND lumpia...

Let's make this easier: This place is FULL of all kinds of:
• Asian food supplies (like an aisle of soy sauce. Plus prefab tamarind sauce & other Asian sauces;
• Some basic American staples (milk, juices, cheeses, deli meats);
• Some Eastern European (desserts, sausages, pastas & cheeses);
• Hispanic food supplies (canned & dry ingredients and a Tortilleria);
• Fresh meats (all kinds) & seafood.

● EXCEPT for fresh East Indian paneer ●
I haven't found that...ONE...thing. Seriously.

There's also cookware & kitchen tools; sake sets; ramen bowls; an aisle of sauces & soups; tea; alcohol (beer & wine); soda, basic & household items (paper towels++).

OOPS I forgot that there's ALSO an Eastern European bakery; 3-4 cafeteria style restaurants; a jewelry store and a Bubble tea place. I hear they've got the best pho you can find. There's a lot of indoor seating for you to eat at & a gorgeous, waterfall-type fountain you can sit at & listen to it's hypnotic sound.

There's also the most aware, helpful & friendly Security team to keep an eye on you in the parking lot (ladies check out the Security guards cause some of them are HOT). The lot has video cameras too & beautiful lights in all the trees at the holidays. KP Billiards is next door with Manny at the cocktail bar.

Set aside 1-2 hours just to figure out that's in this MASSIVE store. It's open until 10:00PM on some nights.<//Text>

Never seen a super market not allowing customers to bring drinks in. I had to bring a child to the bathroom and return inside to meet their parents. The security would not allow me back in because I had a drink in my hand. Security was rude and told you like you were stupid. There is no sign at the door. This is the dumbest supermarket. Don't even let your kids walk to the bathroom if you have a drink in your hand. You will not be allowed to go back in.<//Text>

This food court has a good variety of foods to choose from (cheap sushi, bento, korean food, etc.). The prices aren't unreasonable, and the food portions are good. That being said, the quality of the food itself leaves something to be desired. The cooks here are mediocre at best. A lot of the food is just bland. But it's food court food, so we don't expect much in the first place. Decent place to grab a bite if you're craving fast korean food.</text>

You can find ingredients for virtually every ethnic cuisine here--Korean, Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, Malaysian, Russian, Indian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, Mexican, etc. Good prices on meat and produce as well. There's a bakery and food court on the other side of the grocery store.</Review>

I made the mistake of parking, which I thought was the end of the store!  Wrong...  This store runs almost a block long!

This store is like a grocery store, fish market, bakery, etc.  They carry a lot of stuff in bulk which saves money had you made the same purchase in another store.

Their foodcourt has a variety of different meals but leans more towards the Asian cuisine.

I particularly gravitated towards their Korean B-B-Q where every table has a grill right at your table to cook your order.

Overall this is definitely a good place to shop or to grab a bite.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

This place used to serve V9 Xtra large Pho bowl woth enough garnishing and reasonable quantity of rice noodle. But today I was shocked to see a super small noodles flooded with broth. I talked and showed them that this is way too microscopic and told me that they reduced now. But the reduction was cut by 70 %. I normally would not argue something that I eat. So I asked for additional Thai basil and cilantro because you can count the leaves with 1 hand. They told me that they charge extra. I will never return to KPI Food Court and if I crave Vietnamese food, I would go to Pho Fresh. Today is the last. Never again.<//Text>

Good mix of Japanese, korean and filipino stuff. The produce can be a bit sketchy, the organic section isnt too bad, i would never touch any of the clearance stuff...ever, it should be trashed. Parking lot is humongous, a plus for me.<//text>

Very nice stuff they have over there, however, be prepere to spend some extra money because of the price. Fruits and vegetables are pretty much cheap for a good Quality, while everything else a little pricy. The original name of the place called Korean Plaza, but I was surprised to find some Slavic food over there.</Text>

A good selection of asian food. They've got bento boxes, ramen soup, pho, Japanese rolls, skewers, aandwiches, chow mein, roasted duck, twisted potatoes, fried rice and lots more. There's a bakery on the far left as you get inside.  Affordable meals that'll surely fill your appetite. Tables are cleaned regularly and thy have enough seats for the couples, families and for the ones riding solo. There's multiscreen tv for you to watchon while eating or waiting for your folks who are at the grocery.</Text>

<review>They run this place like a mom and pop back in Korea. I bought Cham Kimchi  because they were out of my usual Manna brand and it turned out to be 2 weeks old. They told me over the phone to bring it back, and then  when I got there they said that they couldn't refund citing the store policy.  Selling 2 week old Kimchi is a fraud to begin with, and they lied  claiming they never sell 2 weeks old kimchi. What a fraud. I left $18 jar on the counter and left. They wasted not only my $18, but also an hour on 20 mile drive.

I've never had this kind of problem in the South Bay where they have several Korean stores. In Sacramento, this is the only major store and they run it as such.  I can't wait for H-Mart to come  in and give them some competition. Till then, stay away from this place and Cham Kimchi. I'll try Smile Market the next time.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Probably the best all around grocery store in Rancho Cordova. Very good deals on fish, meat, vegetables, and ethnic foods like Indian, Chinese, Korean (of course, in the name!), Russian, and Mexican. Lots of stuff here that you can't typically find at traditional stores, like bittermelons, opo squash, sing qua squash, bok choy. Being Korean in origin, the selection in Korean food is unparalleled for the Sacramento region. The selection of other ethnic foods, especially Asian food, is also impressive. The food court is similarly very large and quite good. For major sporting events and occasions - like the Olympics, World Cup, and Superbowl - this is a nice place to hang out and eat some pretty good food that is fast casual and multiethnic.</Review>

< Review>
Not the best Korean market I've been to, but better than nothing. Disappointing produce, almost all shrinkwrapped, limited variety, if you are looking for Korean veg. Many of the people working here know nothing about Korean food. In the fish department, no one knew how to filet a fish! (I do, but I was feeling lazy.) they have removed the live tanks and the fish selection is small unless you are looking for salmon. OTOH, you can get Filipino, Russian, Mexican and more here. Decent selection of Korean basics, including Kimchi from Korea and a local non-MSG variety, but also cheap Kimchi from China.  Overall, I  found this market grimy and unpleasant to shop in. The international variety is interesting, but if you are looking for Korean supplies, you'll do better at Smile. The meat and prepared Banchan are overpriced. I'm always sorry when I decide to shop here, they don't even carry my favorite soju. If you'rr looking for a lot of different stuff you might like it here, but it's not for me. Watch out for the pastry shop. The things I bought were stale, with soggy pastry and dried out fillings.< /Review>

Unprofessional staff. They are racist against white peoples,  I literally saw a asian manager hand a white employee a box and when she asked what it was she said "sugar duh" in the most ugliest annoyed voice ever ! As if that poor girl was supposed to be able to see through the brown box and already know that it is sugar. Then the girl turned around and the Asain manager literally made a mocking face at the girl behind her back like a child would! Anyways it's needless to say that the white girl looked stressed out and scared but she was trying her best.<//text>

I wish there was a way to make a negative star rating to this place it is horrible it is not even if you feel dirty when you walk through it and the grocery store there has security guards who are severely overbearing highly entitled and very much I don't even know how to put it but they literally think there's something wrong or not they abused Authority that they don't even have and they are iss entirely not to mention the fact that they're all a bunch of overbearing bullies who like to pick on older people and disabled people such as my brother who had an encounter with one  they shouldn't even have their jobs because they don't know how to treat people sorry I don't make post like this normally but these people really rubbed me the wrong way.< /text>

<Review>This place is big. Very good produce section, prices are also low on produce, huge variety of asian goods, they also have hispanic, indian section etc where you can find essential things. Good international selection too. Meat, seafood and poultry section also has veriety of stuff. They have food court, bakery section, bar and restaurant too. I suggest you dont park close to entry gate as this place is big and exit gate if on other side of store, so park somewhere in between. What I did not like is customwr service is not very good and the gaurds or security seems like more of goons. Not very friendly.<//Review>< Pictures>

You have to walk all the way from Produce to the food court to exit the store when you first entered through the produce department.  There is a rude uneducated Security Officer standing at the entrance door stopping shoppers from exiting through the double doors. Also when you call and speak to the store manager,  your hung on up,  or told to call back.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
The grocery store visit was great. My daughter and we're hungry so went to the food court to get something to eat.  I order the spicy seafood soup, tampura and potstickers.  We got tampura and potstickers right away. The soup I had to wait for.  10 minutes later I went to ask for it. Only for them to give me the wrong soup. Instead of hot soup I got a cold one and beef NOT seafood like I order. When I took it back the staff didn't say a word.  I asked for my money back and instead of making feel inportant they just gave me the look like I was the one making the mistake.
Never again will i set foot at this court</Review>

Awful place to shop. They have security hounding and berating their customers constantly over no shopping carts in food court and no food in grocery side or whatever else. Highly offensive and embarrassing.</text>

(Translated by Google) The cashier's distraction (Yonsei de Shin) is distracted like taking several calculations, so I'm anxious to check the receipt. He asked me, and then I'd bring it with me because I wasn't really going to take it with him.

<Time>1501866269930</Time><review>(Translated by Google) Although there are mainly Korean ingredients, local ingredients such as China, Laos and Vietnam are also well prepared. There is only one in Sacramento and the price is much cheaper than the regular Asian Mart.
