It’s always great to get my examination done with Dr. Temkin. He is a very personable doctor. Love the communication and going over all reports.

He cares and has time for you. Thank You! So much to the lovely and professional staff at his office.<//Review>

Just in the last month, they’ve hired a very toxic employee that quadrupled my bill, charged me for not coming in weekly, made me come into the office when they use to do service outside. They even asked me, why don’t you just come into the office- I said bc there’s a pandemic! All this would have been fine if they just communicated it to a long standing customer in a way other than “that’s just the way it is now”

This practice is as close as you can come to having your own personal doctor. They get you in front the Dr. quickly when needed and are always responsive and efficient in the front and back office.  Easiest 5 star review ever.< /Text>

Dr Temkins & Staff are AMAZING! I have had some back issues & they made it possible to get the care I needed immediately. As we all know dealing with insurance is not easy but they made it happen. I called several times to the office & there always so nice & super helpful. Dr Temkins cares about his clients & followed up with the referral he gave me. It was nice that he shared his insight about the procedure I am needing. I couldn’t be happier with Dr Temkins & Staff.</review>

Wonderful office staff and I've been seeing Dr. Tempkin since my early 40's!

Dr. Temkin spends time with you.  I never feel rushed.  He is inteterested.  His team is the best.  The office manager manages his appointments extremely well and when there is a need to fit someone in, she seems to always find room for you.  Also recommends good specialists when the need arrises and tells you a little about them.  Very nice office experience.< /text>

<text>This clinic is complete daylight robbery.

1. They want you to book your appts on the phone but nobody picks up the phone. So unless you remember to call them several times a week you are not getting in for your check in. If you miss your check in it doesnt rollover and they have this "zero tolerance" policy for these checkins. I basically paid 270 for 1 15 min checkin because i couldnt get in and schedule my appts

2. The checkins are 15 mins or so and unless you want to pay $270 just so that someone can tell you your current weight, fat %, bmi etc--and for which you need to make the time to call them every week and drive to their location--if that's worth your time go for it.

3. The dr is invisible after the first visit. I was explicitly denied to even see the doctor after i repeatedly requested them to see him and describe my experiences. They wouldnt even allow me to wait to see the doctor.

4. I never even figured out how they count your visits. I got in the first week, missed my second and third weeks because of appt scheduling "difficulties" and they wanted to me pay $270 for the fourth time for the checkin.</text><GmapID>0x808ff28187ff5fb7:0xca987bab69969a13</GmapID>< user_id>

Came into the store and was greeted warmly. I came in with my family to get our phones all upgraded and/or a trade in. By far one of the best experiences I had with an AT&T store and my family has been with AT&T since 2009.  We decided to get the iPhone 12 and 12 mini. The two ladies who helped us. We’re very informative, professional, nice, and took the time to help us despite being very busy. The workers who helped us was the manager named Elizabeth, who mainly helped us, and her associate Reejta. (I am sorry I mostly likely misspelled her name). They answered all our questions. I recommend coming in this store and not the Meadowview AT&T store.< /review>

Store was quiet and clean but it's a limited location. They didn't have what I need, when most other stores do. Also, when I walked in, it was deserted - not even any employees. I understand it's lunch time, but it seems to me that at least one person should be put front. Someone did eventually come from the back to help me.</review>

This store doesn't deserve any stars. Horrible customer service. The employees will do anything to sell the product and services, and once you walk out, boom, they add additional charges to the account and the promised rate at the time of purchase is also changed. Esti - has no clue what she is doing and Alvin being a supervisor, no clue what customer service is. Hung up the phone twice on me. If you contact the store to correct the account, they will not assist you. . I regretted going to this store. I will NEVER deal with this store. My conversation was recorded, so hopefully who is resolving this, may want to go back and listen to the conversations. I will also reached out to the customer care unit regarding this. Worst customer service.< /text>

We went into AT&T at Delta shores just see what kind of a deal we could get because we were no longer happy with Sprint. We already have internet and TV with AT&T so we gave it a shot. Julio is amazing and so helpful. It took some time but we were able to port our phone numbers and get 2 new phones for a great price.  If I could give more stars, I would.</text>

<Text>I have been with AT&T for over 20 years and this is the worst experience I have ever had with AT&T. I ordered a iPhone 12 Pro from Tyler and he promised me that I could come in and he would transfer all the data over for me and take my trade-in.

After the phone was delivered to me, I went to the store to get all my data transferred over and do my trade-in. When I got there, there was 3 guys just standing around with no customers. After a few minutes one of them asks me what I need and tells me they can't do the transfer and another guy just hands me a sheet on how to do it. I understand it is COVID and there are restrictions, but don't promise me things when you are trying to sell me and then not follow through afterwards.

I go home and do the the transfer/activation myself. I then go back into the store a few days later to trade-in my phone and they ask me for all this personal information and tell me they can't do it. I have never been asked so many personal questions from AT&T in my life! I decide to go to another AT&T store near by and they do the transaction in less than 2 minutes.

I don't really write reviews anymore, but these experiences were so horrible that I decided to come out of retirement. On top of the personal information that they ask, I have never seen such this poor of customer service. I mean this is a sales job, right? Anyways, good luck with this store.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I paid my internet bill but somehow AT&T said they didn't receive it. The only time I went to a store to pay my bill and with cash.
There wasn't proof and I didn't keep my receipt (3 weeks). I even asked if they could look back on their camera but was told they can't go back that far.
If I could rate them a zero, I definitely would.</Review>

Please do yourself a favor and go to any other store but here. The apathetic attitude of the employees completely turned me off. I don't expect much when I go to a store, you don't even need to greet me or look at me. But when I ask a simple question about a product I'd like an answer or direct me to where I can get the answer myself.

I'm in agreement with all complaints regarding a man with a ponytail named Julio. He looked up from his phone when another customer and I walked in, then proceeded to browse his phone hoping we'd go away. When others asked him for help he appeared bothered and continued to sigh with annoyance after every word he muttered.

I don't understand how this place continues to run with their incompetent employees.</Review>< Date>

We went in today to discuss our current cell phone plan.  As soon as we walked Xavier greeted us.  He was very helpful in reviewing our plan and making the changes I needed made to our current plan.  We also ended up upgrading my sons phone.  He showed us the different colors.  We picked out a cell phone screen protector and he put it on for us and took care of transferring all of the information off the old phone onto the new one.
Xavier took great care of us today and I will be going back when I am ready to upgrade my phone.</text>

We went to this AT&T store last year and were immediately turned off because of the service.  So much so that we just walked out.  We went back last week and the experience was entirely different.  Melissa and Myasha were so helpful.  The customer service was off the charts.  They were knowledgeable and patiently answered all of my husband's many questions.    They almost made me consider switching from my cell phone company.  This is how customers should be treated anytime they interact with customers.< /Review>

I had a bad customer service experience  with a Mexican chubby woman. So I went online to upgrade phone which I got   approved. So I went to store for curd side pickup for new device simple as that but for some reason she checked my account & find out I'm not eligible for upgrade. So I'm like what was I'm doing in the store if I  didn't get approved for upgrade. She told me that I don't know what I was doing so I end up canceling my order because she don't know what she was doing.</text>

SCAM ARTISTS. STAY AWAY. Nyasha was the one doing everything for me. Either she doesn't know what she's talking about or she's just spouting out bs to get people to sign up. I switched services to AT&T at this store and she gave me false information about plan prices and promotions. Not only her but another employee (short chubby mexican/indian female) was backing her up on the information Nyasha was giving me. I was told that if i traded my phones through them, i would get free iphones paid off, but it was only 50% discounted on my bill. Also, Nyaha and the other female told me that my plan would be $200 a month since the phones would be free. The plan is actually $225 with the NOT FREE phones on top. Not sure if the entire store is like this but stay away from those two or you'll lose money.<//Text>

Listen here! Go in and talk to Isaac!
Isaac the assistant manager here at AT&T was fantastic! I had no clue what would be the best option for me and my family. He asked me a few questions about how I used my phone and what my desires for my family were. After a short conversation, he picked out an excellent plan for my family! I know this because I’ve now had my plan for 5 months! I’m grateful for Isaac’s knowledge and helpfulness.</review>

Best AT&T Store. Cameron, the manager, was very knowledgeable. He helped me choose the right phone and plan that works with my budget. He made sure he understood my situation before telling me which plan will better suit my needs. Something you don’t see anymore. Highly recommend this place.< /text>

< Review>
If you are looking to get a new prepaid cell phone from At&t I recommend that you DON’T go to Delta Shores. What an incredible BAD experience I had at the weekend, the staff are nice but I got convinced that they are unable to sell you a iPhone 11 on prepaid even though it is clearly advertised in the shop.

I have been paying prepaid for over four years, I was told they are unable to take full payment for a phone, so my husband offered to open a new account in his name and I keep my cell number, I  was offered to pay everything on the cell other than $30 which I could pay over either 14 days or 30 months, so we thought ok we can pay it over 14 days. Said I wanted the $65 starter, we wasn’t told how much we would really be paying a month.

When I set my cell phone up on my new account someone else’s email was on the account, customer services didn’t help nor Delta Shores, so we went to Elk Grove, they helped to sort it, I thought that was it and again i would pay $65 a month plus taxes, to my horror my monthly bill would really be $175, if someone at Delta Shores originally told me how much it would really cost I wouldn’t have done any business with them and gone straight to Elk Grove, as I had to go back after I could see the real amount I would be paying, so the Elk Grove branch changed me back to prepaid. Again if you are looking for a new iPhone on prepaid DON’T go to Delta Shores.<//Review>

<text>We have been AT&T customers for many years and have had both good and bad experiences at other AT&T locations. We went to the Delta Shores store today for help with my new iphone. We were acknowledged when we walked in and only had to wait a few minutes before Isaac was available to help us. He was very knowledgeable, helpful and honest. He even wrote down instructions for us to use at home. When you visit this store ask for Isaac if he's available. Great Service!<//text>< user_id>

<username>Omid E<//username><review>Went to this att store for the first time on 9/23/19 around 6 pm. There was a gentleman who was too busy with 2 customers who did not have a time to acknowledge me and my wife for all the time we were there walking around waiting for someone to help us (he tried his best to avoid any eye contacts : )). There was another young lady who was TOO busy with another customer and she also did not get a chance to acknowledge us as well! So we did not know what we should do!...wait or leave!  After walking around for about  20 minutes, we just left the store.  I did not  mind to wait until they finish with other customers but the behavior of the employees (no greeting, ignoring us intentionally to make us to leave) was so unwelcoming. May be it was bad day for them! May be they were tired!<//review>< gmapID>

There was a promo in the window advertising $40 per month for 16gb of data. I came back later the same day to start service. Paid for 2 lines of service. Come to find out the next morning, both lines only had 8 gb of data. I called customer service and was told that promo I was sold expired the week before. They refuse to do anything. I went to the store this morning let the employee know what happened she couldn't do anything. Even after she admitted it had expired after researching, the sign with the expired promo was still in the window and in store. I have pictures of the signage still hanging. I am considering suing for false advertisement. I expected better from this company. DO not get service here! I was sold a plan that was expired this is poor management and reflects poorly on AT&T as a company. I will being filing complaints and letting friends and family to go elsewhere. The district manager needs to fix this!<//Review>< Date>

Initial staff was expedient with selling me a new phone. However, I had to return to get the old one unlocked to kick it down to my partner. What a pain since I told them what I was planning to do.</Review>

<Text>Beware of this place !!! Always ask for any documents and contracts before you sign. They told me they do not to run credit check, but they did anyways. They told me that the activation fees were waived, but they did charged me $25 two lines
When you call to ask for Manager, they say that there are none available to speak with you. Phones were activated for 2 days but received a bill for the whole month.
You are better off going to an AT&T corporate office then to an Authorize stores.</Text>< pics>

Is there  a zero star option? I went in to buy a screen protector. I bought it. The guy couldn't read directions to put it on.  Had me read it and wanted me to explain how to do it to him.  I did. He messed it up and ripped it off, gave me a different one and told me good luck and to try it at home.< /review>

<review>Came in to get the I phone XS, but they didn’t have the 256 gb in stock.  They had to place an order and we would have to pick it up later in the week.  When we came in to pick it up, we noticed they had ordered one 64 gb xs and 64 gb xs max.  Willy was the one that help us and said we would have to go to a real AT&T store to do the exchange since they’re the only ones that carry most phones in stock.  When they called the other store to let them know we were coming he didn’t even fess up to his mistake, instead he said that the customer changed their mind or he mistyped the order or something.  He should’ve just turned us away at the beginning saying that he was incapable of helping us to begin with.< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>Beware of Samuel Z.  This guy added a line to my account on a different number instead of just upgrading my daughters phone.  It took me 3 months and a trip into the ATT store in Elk Grove to clear up all of the charges.  I was shocked to get a bill for over $500 and a monthly bill of $300.

<Text>I love thai boom and the food was phenomenal. The staff was very attentive and quick to deliver! Food had great flavor. The mild yellow curry was still pretty spicy, but I didn’t mind. Also had some orange chicken which was perfectly flavored. It has a sweetness but was very savory at the same time.

There was no wait, and parking was plentiful on the street. They had a TV inside as well to help with those awkward silences in the conversation.<//Text><user_name>Mike Mackintosh<//user_name><userid>114992569224973025757< /userid>< time>

Came in to order food to go. I ordered the Pad-Sew with chicken. Very good food for the price. Restaurant was clean and tidy. Liked the decor, warm and cozy. Customer service was excellent and delivery of food once I placed the order was quick. I highly recommend this place. Definitely will come back.</Text>

I’m so happy I discovered this little gem.  It’s been so long since I’ve had authentic and delicious thai food. I ordered the shrimp curry and shrimp pad Thai.  Amazing!  I highly recommend. Total for two orders of shrimp pad Thai and shrimp curry with a glass of wine was $60.  If you’re in the neighborhood definitely worth checking out.<//text>

<text>We had a late lunch here about 3 pm. We knew exactly what we wanted so the waiter took our order right away.

We ordered the Tom Yum soup and Mango with sticky rice.

The soup was very delicious, it was sour and spicy. Nice compliment with sweetness of the dessert.< /text>< date>

The chef is unable to make the food to meet the tastes of the customer. Hot spicy scale is just plain too hot. I asked to cool it down to medium spicy to start, even after they attempted to fix it, it was not edible. Then I gave 20 dollars cash, and my card for the balance and discovered they took the cash, add charged me the full amount on my card.
I couldn't establish that to them, so I couldn't get it back.
Not pleased.</Text>

Just ordered a red curry with beef and glass noodles with chicken, a very basic order that should not be too complicated to achieve for a so called "Thai Restaurant".  Beef in the red curry was super chewy almost like eating beef jerky or the belt holding up my pants.  The glass noodles were tasteless with the chicken overcooked making it also very tough and hard to chew.  Nothing worse than spending $40 and getting a crappy meal.  I would never order from this joint again.  The cook needs to taste his own food first.  I love Thai food but this place ranks in last place of all Thai joints that I have explored so far and I have been to many.  As a previous reviewer remarked, "this place should not exist".<//text>

<Text>Totally disgusting and totally disappointing. The drunk man noodles are just spaghetti in flavorless sauce with large chunks of inedible jalapeños. The fried rice is just Mexican style red rice. So bizarre. This restaurant should not exist.</Text>< user>

<review>INCONSISTENT QUALITY:   Been there three times in a week because the first time was so amazing (we had pad thai, curry and gyoza), although the curry was extremely soupy and the gyoza was a little too crispy. But everything was delicious...the first time. The second time I had the orange chicken (horrible - not orangy and the pieces were small, so they were over done during the frying process) and my husband had the pad thai again (not nearly as good as the 1st time). We went again tonight with some clients and we all had the pad thai, which was dry and bland. This was a real disappointment because it was so dang good the first time!<//review>< gmap_id>

Called this afternoon on 11/28 at 12:06pm to confirm their hours, bc with Covid hours are not always accurate or updated. I showed up at 5:05pm and there was one person in the chair finishing up and one person waiting. The barber said they close at 6pm and no longer accepting walk-ins. I told him I called earlier, confirmed the phone number, and who ever answered said they close at 7pm. He didn’t seem to care or offer a resolution w/ a future discount or anything. I would understand if I came in 30 minutes prior to closing but an hour? You would think during a pandemic AND being a small business they would have been more understanding. Thanks guy< /review>

On the day that you went to the shop, Saturday, the new guy answered the phone and made a mistake on the closing time he told you. We also had an unusually bad day in terms of staffing. A lot of our barbers took the day off after the holiday  and some of the barbers we had left early. The new guy was left by himself. He’s still in training as far as how to tend to the business goes. He should have been able to offer you options and an apology right there and then. We hope you accept our apology and allow us to make things right.'}</resp>

<Review>A great cut every time at this barber shop - I rarely don't get complements after my visits. There's very hometown feel to this place, with lots of classy touches. The barbers always have a good attitude. All the guys here seem to be really great with kids. They really know how to cut a man's hair. I've been going here over 7 years now.< /Review>< pics>

Very clean and professional looking. The barbers take their time to make their customers look fresh.

If you’re military who gets a “medium fade” every week it would behove of you to ask for a low fade. Some of their barbers (at least mine) may go too high for a medium fade.

I would rate this place higher if my barber didn’t give me a high fade after asking for a medium, “bite” too much into the top sides of my head, or bring the fade up higher after realizing my left side was not faded as well faded as my right. Had my barber mentioned he messed up the fade on one side and asked me for input to work out a solution this review would be rated at least four stars.< /review>

He lives far away and only has weekends with me, and I'm the one who prompts him to get a haircut.   His haircuts are great 90% of the time.  He says the guys are great.  This issue is (and good for them) they are too busy.  My BF went down this morning and was 4th in line with 6 barbers cutting.  One-by-one, appointments trickled in, so he ended up waiting for more than an hour.  No one ever said, "Hey guys, we have a lot of appointments, so you might be here a while."  Senor Barbers should either not take appointments before 11 o'clock, or not take walk-ins before 11 o'clock.  At least if someone made it clear beyond, "Sorry for the wait." after the fact, he and other walk-ins could have made an informed decision about how to use their precious weekend time.  He won't be going back because he feels his time has some value and that it wasn't really considered as he sat for well over an hour.<//review><userid>108308832571783446644<//userid>< username>

Gotta come here every week to get my haircut, never have had a bad experience. The general vibe of the place is super chill yet traditional, and most importantly all the barbers are masters of their craft and friendly as can be.

Actually my first time here I just planned on using the in-house ATM because that what I normally did at my old barber shop, but the ATM was broken. The barber (sorry dude forgot your name) was super chill about it and was fine with me leaving to go to an ATM near by to pull some cash. No freak outs or anything. Thanks guys.<//text>

This barber shop is great. Its the same staff from the SC shop. Ivhave gone to almost all of the barbers in the beach cities and senor barber just seems to get my hair right. Every place i tried made me look like i just got drafted. This place has the old school feel to it and you will find the barber that understands what your after. PS make sure to ask to get your neck straight blade shaved.< /Text>

On occasion, the result of a cut differs from what was requested due to misinterpretation, and even that is unacceptable to us.   We encourage you to contact us via email at ken@thesenorbarber.com as we would like to correct our mistake. We will also make sure to address our crew with your comment above and reiterate the importance of following customers' requests."}< /Response>< gmapID>

I get a cut every 2 weeks. That being said my standard for a proper cut is through the roof. Typically when I go to a new shop I dont get the results I want or expect. However Kevin really did an excellent and thorough job on the first cut! I havnt gone to another barber since.... every cut gets better and better. But I see the cuts the other barbers give and they are all great as well, I highly reccomend this place and for sure reccomend Kevin, as hes honestly probably the best barber I've ever had.<//Text>

<review>I drove there from Laguna hills and I got there 35 min before closing and they told me to go back tomorrow because they close at 7:00. At the door says They  take the last person 20 min before 7:00 and I got there 35 min and they wouldn’t cut my son’s  hair, very upsetting and time wasted<//review>< pics>

I was so happy to finally come back to this one since the rude chola manager left. Just to find out the new manager is just as bad. Mariam is so ill prepared to have the title she does. Why do you put new management with no experience in charge? Her attitude is disgusting and the way she speaks to people is vile .</Review>

My replacement battery died before I had it even 1 yrs. I already had to replace it once. The lady, she's the store manager said the 3 yrs was up on the 1st battery so they would not honor the warranty if the 2nd battery ended before its three year life expectancy. Battery was not good, did not hold a charge. I'll buy from the factory from now on.</Review>

I called to this place and Raymond Cerragosa was very helpful great customer service  . I had been having a difficult time calling other autozones and trying to get information about a part for my vehicle and none of them seemed to know what I was talking about . But when I called to this place Raymond right away knew what part I was looking for . It’s always nice to call to these type of places knowing that the employees have knowledge of auto parts .<//review>

<text>I went into autozone this evening to return something I didn’t have use for. There was a gentleman who was working by the name of Will. (From my observation, the store manager) the store was pretty busy and not only was Will patient, he was answering everyone’s questions  thoroughly in a timely manner. Not just that but he was also training another gentleman. 5 stars goes out to this particular autozone for Wills great customer service.< /text><UserId.>110618774259891618528<//UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1513741875542< /date><rating>5</rating><gmapID>0x80dcaccb9499d447:0xf6bd4b1058156be7< /gmapID><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

<review>Very rude employee, saying that I don't know what I'm talking about, as I already got the MSD part number, and it was right behind them, and saying that's not what you need, and insisting asking what my car is. Go to O'riley across the street, cheaper anyway, and got what I need with friendly service.< /review>< Pics>

<review>I get clear understanding of my relationship with God.  B.K. Sister Kusum Bahen has very immense depth of Baba”s knowledge. Baba”s Murali definitely changes attitudes and outlook. Meditation conducted by instrument soul sister Kusum bahen washes soul”s impurity. As a soul I always get renewed with positive vibrations.< /review>< pictures>

I would like to express my deep gratitude to Brahma kumaris center for teaching me RAJA YOGA MEDITATION!! Thank you for sharing step by step The life secret in a practical way: Nurture the seed then the branches, leaves...will be automatically nurtured.

When I take care to make "me" - "the inner being" powerful,  I feel peaceful, happy, strong, courageous, humble, full,....
With these as my strength, my mood, work, relationships, responsibilities are taken care with ease and beautifully.

I save So much TIME this way. I understand this as to sharpen the saw and also to put First things first. The habits of highly effective people!!!!

I have started to experiment and implement in my life, the life teachings shared here and I just love and enjoy my life and experience life is full of miracles!

I wake up every morning with so much joy, thankfulness and excitement!!<//Text>

<Text>I have been going to this meditation place for last 7 years and it has brought a great positive change in myself at how I look at things now. Earlier I would be bothered easily with little things not going my way but now I have faced even bigger adverse situations in life with such an ease only because of the things I learnt from this place.
Also during these difficult pandemic times it has been a great help to keep up the spirits by listening to online classes offered by the Center.
Forever grateful to have known this place.<//Text>< Date>

Center has very powerful vibration. In the beginning when I came to the center, I felt everyone so peaceful, loving, and living as one family. I feel very grateful to be part of this family, God’s family :).</Text>

<Text>All the sessions of the online Rajyoga Meditation have been very special for me, and am sure this course will help me proceed in the journey towards ‘Soul Consciousness’ with ease and confidence. I was apprehensive earlier since I was doing this online course seated here in Mumbai, but that never was a problem in the entire eight session course.

Om Shanti,
The Brahma Kumaris Meditation Center in the heart of Silicon Valley is a blessing for anybody who is wishing to be a creator of peace and not just a seeker of peace. The whole BK family exhibits love and peace only found in a perfect world. Silicon Valley is very fortunate to be bathed in such pure vibrations day in day out. It truly brings science and spirituality together - no pun intended.
To me, it feels like a new birth stepping into a new era with a possibility of life filled with eternal peace has become a reality. Challenging situations still come only for me to master the art of mastering the inner world. Coming to a realization it is my inner world that creates my outer reality. And filled with gratitude to the Supreme Being for bringing light into the dark corners of our lives, helping me offer the best of me.< /text>

I never even in my dreams think that it was possible for me to stay peaceful for an extended period of time, even during crisis and extremely busy times. I learnt the art of experiencing inner peace at the Brahma Kumaris Center. The center has such pure and positive vibrations. I feel empowered by the environment, people, knowledge, and meditation that is offered here. My life has changed completely and I see positive impact in every sphere of life. I highly recommend this center.<//Text>

<review>Very peaceful and amazing place to take a break out of this machine made world and connect with self. The volunteers are very friendly and the management is 5 star. The sister is extremely loving and caring. Very clean meditation room with peaceful vibrations. I have a great experience every time I go. This is a very easy way to meditate even for beginners. Found that they are non profit approved by United Nations and also, all their services are free.< /review>< pics>

<Review>SV Brahmakumari center is a place full of peace, love and powerful positive energy. It has filled the vacuum in my life which I always felt in and around me. It has given a new direction to my thoughts, words and action and introduced me to who am I and who is mine. The noble teachings of world transformation through self transformation has helped me handle my work and relations with a positive attitude. Sister kusum and whole BK family is extremely loving. I feelblessed!</Review>< Time>

This is God( Baba) ‘s home.BK sister Kusumdidi is excellent teacher, I learn from her everyday.
I took Rajyoga meditation course 8 years ago and the spiritual knowledge we get, it changes our way of thinking. We see everyone as our brothers and sisters- children of one supreme father. ( Shiv Baba)
It teaches us how to stay calm in all situations and increases our inner strength to face any difficulties.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1590860152065, 'text': 'Thank you'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I want to share my experience after coming into Knowledge (Gyan.I started my spiritual journey almost 1and half year back before that I was under lot of stress and overwhelmed by having twin boys.I used to have a lot of expectations from my family members but after getting divine knowledge I was able to Become a detached observer and started analyzing my weakness and overcome them one by one and was also able to understand and accept others. ( their sanskaars)and situations.I have experienced Divine power and peace within me during meditation.This divine knowledge and Rajayoga meditation really helps me stabilize my mind In difficult situations and focus My mind towards solutions.I have experienced divine help in each and every step while following ( practicing) RajYogi life style. This practice has changed my life 360 degree. I am able to take care of my mind and body. When my mind became stable and strong I started taking care of my body and lost 20 pounds and overcome health issues. We all are souls and must know And experience our real identity and powers and should definitely experience the connection with God .So we can become the master of our own life.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Its my fortune to express my experience of being associated to the BK center for almost 1.5 years now. I could rediscover myself,  meet with better version of myself and hence could attract only positives in my life, by regular meditation practice. I could instill the right values in me as well as recognize and then erase completely the negative sanskar in me, through all the guidance given by daily words of wisdom read by Sister Kusum, the center head. Being part of the divine BK family is such a big fortune.  Jo paana tha so pa liya - Mera wonderful Baba !!</review><user_id>107697647495987597623</user_id><Rating>5</Rating>< Resp>

It is a great place to rejuvenate your true self. BK teachings and classes here helped me understand the deep philosophy of life, karma and together with Raja yoga Meditation taught here I feel that I have gained inner strength and stability to face various situations in life. The education of living values and tips on practical application act as a guide for me to imbibe those values in my life and help me enjoy life to the fullest. I would strongly encourage people of all streams of life to explore it for themselves to discover their inner treasures.< /review>

Brahma Kumaris is a great place to not only transform your life with Rajyoga meditation, but also it teaches you how to live peacefully in this stressful world. I have been following them for 19 years and it always feels great to attend live classes from the sister every week. The meditation room has a very powerful positive environment. All the volunteers are very cooperative and always eager to help with every activity. Moreover, it is FREE :-)< /review>

This is an experience in which you get to learn about yourself and others. I have been going to  Brahma Kumari organization for 10 years and my view on life has been totally changed after receiving the wonderful knowledge this organization has provided.
I recommend everyone to go and experience the real meaning about life. They offer a variety of classes based on age groups, kids classes, adults Hindi and English classes, webinars, silent retreats, etc.
I am a very fortunate soul who recognize Brahma Kumaris teachings 😊</text>

<review>It changed my life when I joined after joining Bhrama Kumaris, things are same as before but the way I am seeing those rough situations is completely different . If I have to convey in single word, its like we came out of BK organization  with pair of different set of glasses which makes to see situation   and accept each and every person as is and giving the space to yourself and relieve from all sorrows.</review><gmap_id>0x808fcf2853b8b439:0x7b5108bf55d3287a</gmap_id><user_name>Venkata ravi ramesh వేంకట రవి రమేష్ ముక్కవిల్లి</user_name></record></dataset><record>

It is so grossly visible that they don't do what they aspire for.. Maybe they need some trained professionals but we can't expect this from volunteer organizations like this</review>< rating>

Through out my life i was searching for spirituality and i have reached my destination, I started loving myself more and more each time i received supreme wisdom from sisters there, they are free of charge and donations are welcome, really it was a long time i felt the total acceptance until i went to this center, i can be like a child and attend any of the course or be there without an awareness that some body is judging, i could only see pure beings , pure thoughts, powerful vibration, the experience i felt there i cannot limit within this review, the experience is a sea, vast , unlimited knowledge, i would call it as Amirth and to reach there , each of us must have already put some effort to receive such a pure godly wisdom, this silicon valley is blessed and i am sure all people in this world will be always blessed and for anyone who is reading this, only success and love come into your life, a lot of blessings to you.

Being a part of Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual Organization has been a life transforming experience. I have been coming to the Silicon Valley center for the last 10years and the journey has been magical. I want to continue the practice of Rajyoga Meditation for the rest of my life.

I don’t have enough words to thank our spiritual teacher Sister Kusum. She has been instrumental in bringing out all the positive qualities in me. She is a kind, loving and nurturing human being who genuinely cares about the wellbeing of all the people who come to the center. I am eternally grateful for her love, support and guidance for helping me grow in my spiritual life.

I recommend all individuals to visit our center and experience the peace and divinity by practicing Rajyoga meditation.</Review>

Highly recommended place. Sometimes we forget why we are just running and chasing around in life. Then the realization comes that Life has to be more than just eating, sleeping and chasing dreams. I was fortunate to find Brahmakumaris Silicon Valley Milpitas Center and I made it a point to go and commit to the Raja Yoga Courses they offer for FREE. Life has changed 360 degrees since then, so happy. I make it a point to go here and meditate minimum 2 times a week.<//Text>

< Review>
The greatest organization I came across.

spirituality is really my interest and came across many organizations, but most are commercialized; even the well known "Art of Living" really put bad taste in my mouth. Other places seem to be following their route.

Came across other spiritual gurus too; but they were at too high level. This organization and their teaching, we can understand; very relatable and practical.

Where as this is a total selfless organization. Everyone is striving to be better. Sister Shivani's talks changed my life and I am recommending my kids to listen to her talk. Who will recommend their kids to listen anything unless it is good for them?

Their goal is to bring Satyug and that will happen for sure. You want your life to be in Satyug, come and check out the organization and especially Sister Shivani's event coming up on June 2nd and 3rd in the Bay area.<//Review>

<Review>Decent food at an expected price. Beans and rice are great. Rest of food is very good. Red and green sauce are quite hot. Location is nice, easy to get to, lots of dedicated parking. Staff are friendly. Parking, entrance and counter are accessible. Will return in the future.<//Review>< user>

<Text>There super fries were amazing! Probably the biggest serving I've ever gotten from any fast food restaurant. Almost perfect but unfortunately they need to let the fries cook a little more longer other then that amazing definitely will return if ever in the area:)<//Text>< Pictures>

Got their carnitas small tacos. They were SUPER SALTY! I couldn't finish all the tacos bc they were just way too salty. Like the meat was cooked with a cup of salt! Never had such salty meat from a Mexican place 😖. I got some guacamole with my order but it was all watery. So yeah if you get carnitas- beware. Not sure about the other meat bc I haven't tried it. And their guacamole isn't good.</Review>

Still haven't tried everything but I can say that, being a fan of carnitas, they have great tacos, burritos, and nachos. Super fries are great as is their burrito version. Sure it's artery clogging but might as well go with a smile.< /text>

<Review>Quality of the food is lowered since they opened.
Customer service varies depending on the day the cashier has for the day, I been at least 4 times in 3 weeks and sometimes they're nice, other days are just flat.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

Come here often. Love it. Always recommend it to people and honestly I think it's better than Casa del Rey's lol way better. Was wondering about the taco Tuesday deal here though.</text>

< review>
We were just passing by when we saw an elliptical that looked interesting. Billy the owner answered our questions, including those regarding the warranty and possible repairs.  Billy was enthusiastic, but certainly not overbearing. It was a brand with which we were unfamiliar and we wanted to do a little research before committing and Billy was happy to put the machine on hold. We returned the next day after we did some searching and recognized that Billy's price was very fair. Within an hour, Billy made arrangements, the machine was courteously and efficiently delivered by Steven, and we were ellipticing (if there be such a word) away. We couldn't be happier with the elliptical and with our experience with Billy and his establishment.  In the future it will be the first place we shop for our sporting good needs.</review>

<text>Needed a set of second-hand gold clubs.

The gentleman working here (Manny) was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He was refreshingly transparent about the prices and quality of the equipment. In the end we were able to pick out a near-full custom set of clubs (and accessories) that suited my experience level.

I would recommend this place for anybody who wants some advice with your equipment and game. With affordable prices!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Honest, knowledgeable,  and friendly staff are three words to describe this store. I've sold items, bought items, and just browsed. I never feel rushed. I really appreciate their customer service.< /Text>

<text>Great prices, good selection of new and used equipment. The sales people are friendly and helpful and happy to answer questions. I was looking for free weights, but, like every where else, they had mostly sold out. There were  a few mismatched  weights left and being desperate I decided to buy them. Manny surprised me when I got to the counter and gave them to me for free!!! Super nice guy. Would shop there again. Highly recommend.< /text>< Pics>

I purchased a weight set and realized that I bit off a bit more than I could chew. It was very easy to return and get something more reasonable. No questions asked.</text>

I was going to buy an elyptical off facebook. I tried it out but decided to go to Play it Again Sports to find out more about the brand. The staff was so knowledgeable, friendly and honest. Great pricing as well. The model I chose was not the most expensive but the best bang for the buck. I purchased new because I really liked the machine, price and warranty. They price match too even online pricing! I highly recommend this store if you're searching for honest, knowledgable and friendly staff. I'm very happy with my purchase!<//Review>

I did not have my receipt and had gotten it over 6 months ago.  They did not hesitate to not only fix the problem, they gave me a new receipt and registered the warranty for me!!!!  Who gives that kind of service anymore.  The owner Billy is as straight up a guy as you will find.  I cannot say enough about how impressed i am with their knowledge, service and honesty.

I feel like the person on the floor was helpful and even got on the equipment to show me how it was used and explained to me the difference in which type of athletes would prefer each type of equipment.

Billy, the owner, honored the discount his manager granted me the day before, helped me load the 2 kayaks into my car with a great deal of effort. The staff was most helpful and instructive on the use of the kayaks. After using the kayak the next day, I was so pleased with it and with the service at Play it Again Sports, that I ordered another kayak from them today and will make the one-hour drive tomorrow to pick it up (and again, expect them to load it and tie it down to my car).</Review>< pictures>

Billy Briscoe is a true professional who cares first and foremost about customer service. When I purchased a faulty elliptical machine he offered to replace it or refund it --no questions asked. Billy is old school all the way. He sells equipment at affordable prices and will make sure every customer is properly taken care of.

YOU WILL NOT GET THIS KIND OF SERVICE ANYWHERE ELSE. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE HIGHLY ENOUGH!<//Review>

What a great shopping experience!  I was not expecting such great service and professionalism in this day and age when service and knowledge is tough to come by.  i was blown away when i went in to shop for a home gym at not only what they carry, but also their ability to match any online price on new equipment.  These guys also do warranty and repair work, deliveries and installs and they stand by what they sell.  They even warranty used equipment!  I had been told by many friends and associates about how great this local business is, but now i truely know for myself.  I will be giving them my highest recommendation!< /text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><date>1382645966052</date><Review>I visited recently and was introduced to Manny Vivero.  I had lots of questions about golf clubs and courses which he answered patiently and professionally.  He took the time (even though there were other customers coming in) to work with me personally and answer all of my questions.  He even took the time to give me a number of tips about my golf stance, grip and posture.  The tips he provided produced immediate results.  I've been to the range a couple of times since then, and my striking of the ball has improved significantly.  In addition, the cost of used clubs is very reasonable and an excellent bargain for those of us who are getting back into playing or are just starting out.  If you have any questions about clubs or anything else to do about golf, Manny will be able to help you out.< /Review>< user_id>

Stopped in there looking for a wooden softball bat for an upcoming tournament, something that every other store in Santa Rosa DOESN'T have. Not only did they have one, but they had a few to choose from. The associate Manny was very helpful with my questions and sold me the bat for a good price, as well as other accessories.  Later that day, I went to the park and used the bat for just 5 minutes and wouldn't you know, that same day the bat broke! Very disappointed, I came back the next day and let them know the situation about the bat, they understood, apologized and they were so willing to fix it, they gave me a new replacement bat with no hassle. I am a very satisfied customer and will be back, these guys have alot of great prices on new and used sports equipment and have the good service to go with that! I recommend them to everyone!<//review>< GmapID>

<text>If it was possible to give a zero review that's what they would get.   I spent over $1000 on a machine then paid them another 80 to set up and deliver. called a week ago to make an appointment. Was advised by Steve to call back within a week when it got closer. I called today and spoke w a gentleman who claimed to be the owner. I advised him off my situation , he then told me he would have some else call me back. Then he proceeded to drop an f bomb like he's taking to his pals. Clearly they only care about the $.< /text>< pictures>

They had nothing for my sport, cycling. So I am not impressed. They had a lot of stuff seemed like for mostly organized sports like softball and pee wee football. Once again no cycling equipment at all!!
Totally useless store to me!!< /Text>

My sister and I visited Play it Again Sports on Oct. 29, 2012.
While looking at a bicycle an employee came up and waited on us.
It was about noon and he introduced himself as the owner, Billy Briscoe.
I was told the bicycle could be held for me for 72 hours, with my credit card #,  while I made up my mind.
On Thursday, Nov. 1 at 10:00 I found that the store charged my bank account for the bike!
I spoke to the owner and he changed his story and said I must have misunderstood; his word against mine.

Not so, my sister was my witness.

I should have read the previous Google reviews and  would have been aware of this type of business practice!</text>

I have been in the service industry for over 30 years and i was totally impressed with the customer service experience i recently had with the play it again sports store in santa rosa   i think it may have been the best retail service i have ever experienced and it was totally unnecessary because i only spent $50.00 but these guys went waaaaaaay above and beyond to make sure i was satsfied.  i was buying some weights and mentioned that i was looking for a treadmill belt for an older treadmill i had purchased years ago.  the owner got online for me (after i had allready purchased the weights) and went to 3 different online sources to hunt down the belt.  when he came out of his office with all the info after about 15 minutes, i didn't understand why he would take time away to help someone with a treadmill that was not even purchased through them!  he said that he simply wanted to help me solve my problem.  he also gave me a phone number for someone who would install it.  i was paying attention to his employees as well and they were extremely knowledgeable and as helpful as i have ever seen in retail.  this store will floor you with their service, knowledge, and professionalism.  shop these guys and you will be happy you did.< /text>

<review>I have given Marian hospital five stars based only on the visual appeal of the hospitals grounds.  Luckily I have not had an  opportunity to receive care for myself since the new facility came online a few years ago.  Sadly, many of my friends and loved ones
have needed care here.  During those times when I am visiting people who are receiving care I often take the time to wander around the beautiful grounds and find that the well maintained trees and plants along with the sculpture of St. Francis and others brings peace and comfort in times of sadness or concern.  Thanks to those who work to keep all of us all healthy and to those who maintain the hospital grounds.  May you and your families  enjoy good health and a long prosperous life.</review><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

Had a bad experience... unfortunately the staff seemed like nothing is happening! I took my mother cause a horrible pain and we got there at 1145pm and 140am still no chance to be taken inside... it was not as busy... staff seemed cold towards all incoming patients!! For I don't expect them to be in tears but at least be more compassionate!! Good attitude goes long ways!!<//Text>

<text>My Physical Therapist, Mary is the Best! She listens and made me feel very comfortable. I’ve had some issues with Doctors that just go through the motions but didn’t really help so I was leery at first but Mary quickly proved she wasn’t like that at all.I would recommend Her to anyone! Everyone there was very nice and genuinely care.</text>< Pictures>

Horrible service this day, it was full house. if could give no stars I would but the app won't let me. Waited minimum two hours if not more to get them to see my mom took her there for stroke symptoms, there excuse was no rooms with monitors available. Back in the 80s they saved my life there, god bless them those were other times.</Review>

Was very please how organize the whole process of getting vaccination on January 23, 2021 at 1 p.m. It took 1 hour and 17 minutes from the start of line to end after vaccination waiting for 15-20 minutes at the very last tent making sure there was no reaction. My only regret was I wasn’t able to be on a wheelchair when I hardly couldn’t walk, it wasn’t till a nice staff helper saw me almost falling down that she helped me and luckily grabbed a wheelchair nearby to put me on it. I only wished that I could have had my husband with me when I started on the line because my husband is my caretaker, but the lineman said I’m using a cane my husband can wait for me when done. So my husband went back to our Van till I was done. My thanks to the fireman who helped me push the wheelchair to my waiting van and all of a sudden surprised heavy down of rain came down on us! Thankful my husband was able to move the van closer to the last tent and both the guard and my husband helped put me back in the van! My husband John Michael Gagarin is 70 years old and I wished he could had been with me the whole time. I beg you please to let him have his vaccine, I’ve called multiple times and left messages but still never ever got a call back. Thank you for listening and thank you for a very well organize vaccine process. 👍👏👏👏👏👏<//Review>

Marian had the most organized event I have ever been to.  Efficient, smooth, no noticeable glitches.  It obviously was ran by a nurse!
I was there 2 days with 2 different people.  But both days it ran smooth as silk.
Your set up plans should be shared all over the nation .</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I wanted to give a shout out to the nurses Stephanie and Jazmin (also to all the other nurses) who helped me in room 490 (old part of Marian). I had a 5 day stay for my gallbladder surgery and they were extremely helpful and courteous to my needs. I wish I could give them a personal thanks but I wouldn't know how to go about that.
Thank you much again as I'm still on my road to recovery.<//review>< name>

Warning: Billing Department will attempt to scam you!

Wanted to give two stars because Dr. Paluay deserves better, but I am unfortunately forced to seek medical care elsewhere & I don't want anyone else financially burned the way I have been by this low class hospital. It is morally reprehensible, not to mention unprofessional, to intentionally obfuscate where billing is concerned & then site "privacy" as if a courtesy service is being provided. We live in a capitalist society, grow up people..  I am entitled to receipts prior to payment, medical or not. In this country an exchange of money is a transaction of services & nothing more - you cannot proclaim to care for your patients & yet inconvenience them at the same time - you do not exist in both worlds in this country & we are not ignorant of this fact.

Their billing department doesn't even send notice of whether or not they've made a claim, but even worse, we should not be required to request itemized receipts. If you're going to play that game where you pretend I'm getting SUCH a deal by paying "early" (you know, prior to you even attempting to collect with my insurance), there is no reason I should have to jump through hoops to receive the confirmations I deserve. You aren't protecting me, you're scamming me. Protecting me would be caring about my best interest, you are a business that just charged me 3 times what a normal lab would & then tried to get the money from me first without even mentioning or attempting an insurance claim! Lesson learned a guess though; all companies that do everything, "in-house" always seem to charge more & yet have poor quality staff, don't they? Thanks for the lesson though.

Update: They didn't even attempt to submit a claim for my husband's bill & when I received word from our insurance about MY claim, I only owed the co-pay because Well Woman's visits are covered almost entirely under my insurance (obviously, considering it's preventative).

I don't care if I'm dying, I will NOT use this medical center & I will avoid all other Dignity Health facilities as best as I possibly can (shouldn't be too hard when we move back to LA County in a few months). You people are the absolute worst & I'm not giving you anymore of my energy.</Review>

< Review>
At the height of a pandemic (December 2020) the care I received was professional, compassionate and exceeded expectations. Each area of my care from the surgical team, food service, janitorial, PT/OT, and the top notch nursing staff was exceptional. Having a major surgery with no personal visitors or family support on hand could have been very stressful; and I will be forever grateful to each person involved in my care and comfort.</Review>

I recieved my first vaccination at Marian Regional Medical Center.  The process was so smooth that although I was excited to get the vaccine the experience was uneventful.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the whole process including 15 minutes of sit time after my injection took 30 minutes or less.<//Text>

Well Marian has showed there true colors again... They had a ECMO device bought by
one of the affluent family trusts that have been
gracious enough to donate iPads for families to keep in contact during COVID.
With all the billboards up and down Highway 101 and patting themselves on the back for having specialty services while being on hold and in the local papers of supposed advanced care, Marian obviously wasn’t interested in buying ECMO devices to save the  lives of the local community citizens, but as soon as someone else was willing to pay for the device they decided it would except the free offer and then publicize like they were all interested in the device use. So when you see the fancy billboards up and doen the highway that they spend thousands upon thousands of dollars per month and paying rent on the old Valley hospital that is not  in use ( the rent is appox. $100,000.00 per month ) .
Possibly so no other hospitals can easily come into the area. Thank goodness Santa Barbara Cottage hospital has opened an Urgent Care on North Broadway and soon to open in Orcutt on Clark Ave. near the 101 highway.
There is quite a large number of people that believe the big donors should donate elsewhere as Marian is just a corporate so-called nonprofit establishment and if you look at the salaries paid you’d have to wonder if there right.
If donating helps purchase equipment to save lives because Marian isn’t willing too then its a good thing that theres some rich uneducated
families.
But remember how many local residents have
passed away and per the newspaper article the ECMO device will save lives then why was Marian unwilling to spend the money ? The ECMO device reimbursement rate will be very high and corporate will love the revenue that the device brings in ( probably will get bonuses )
So when you see the religious statues and tower please remember the lives that was lost and the Sisters that started the hospital would be furious as to how the funds are misappropriated.
If you see hospitals indicating they are award
winners from companies like Leapfrog and Healthgrades, if you look into how they come about receiving awards they are basically bought as they don’t go into the facilities.
One staff member shared that they go on and give high reviews just to up the ratings.
If you ask around you’ll see most residents of the area will go to Santa Barbara for their procedures as the quality is far superior. Luckily
for Marian the staff have to use the hospital for
procedures.<//review>

Then while waiting, when someone did arrive, they would sign an electronic pad with attached peb and put hands on the counter and not one employee attempted to sanitize anything. Is this normal policy or lazy employees? Just want to warn everyone to be careful.< /review></record>

My experience in receiving my first covid-19 vaccine shot was a uneventful. Everything went smoothly, maybe to many close distancing in the 15min. Tent! And around the heaters.</Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I had a miscarriage in June 2020 & went to the hospital at the advise of my doctor. I was repeatedly promised my baby was fine & healthy, that my pregnancy would proceed normally & I would get to hold my baby at the end, despite the ultrasound clearly showing a blighted ovum (gestational sac but no baby), heavy bleeding, painful cramps, & generally the miscarriage exactly mimicking the first miscarriage I had a few months prior. I had my symptoms brushed off, told I couldn't receive help for the miscarriage since I was definitely not having one. I was told I was confused about when I had conceived, despite keeping track of it very closely & I actually conceived 2 weeks later than I thought, despite not having intercourse anywhere near that time. I was promised I would only pay my copay & then was asked to pay more than that in order to be allowed to leave - with the promise I would be reimbursed for any amount over the copay. In the last 7 months, I've received many bills far above my copay & no reimbursement. I never received an itemized bill as requested. I cannot get a call back. I have been in the process of disputing the bills for 7 months. After asking for a dispute form repeatedly & told that things would be on hold for a month & then we can reassess & nothing would go to a collection agency, they sent everything off to a collection agency. The form clearly shows they sent everything to the collection agency within 24 hours of this promise to not send to the collection agency & to finally send me the form to formally dispute. I hadn't even received the form to fill out when they sent everything to a collection agency. I've continued to be lied to, my health disregarded, my symptoms not listened to or taken seriously & I received no actual care when I sought care. I find this to be the most unprofessional of any hospital I have ever worked with on a professional level or visited for personal reasons. I would recommend not seeking help or driving over an hour to a different hospital over ever going to this ER for anything. They are not doing the public any type of good service & they are definitely doing the public a huge disservice. (Jan.)

Edit: I see they have responded, same response I have gotten for over 7 months. (Feb.)

Edit 2: Luckily I took a photo scan of the dispute form before I sent it in so I sent that form to the collection agency, same day as original review. The collection agency promised to take it up with the hospital because they said they never never had this type of issue before - I finally got someone's attention. They called me. They told me that 2 other people would need to call me about this issue - all 3 of them would need me to go over every detail (which is not easy to do but I said I would be willing to do so). I had 1 other person call me, not 2. I had to go over every detail & answer many questions for each person. I was promised that they would take the bill back from the collection agency, combine the many different bills & that the hospital would cover it all....FINALLY. They said they cannot provide any type of confirmation but said I would get a letter in 4-6 weeks letting me know I didn't owe anything to anyone anymore & I would likely continue to receive things between now & then saying I did owe & to ignore those. (February)

Edit 3: I have still not received anything from Marian in the mail. I did receive a refund of my payment from when I was in the ER that I had to pay in order to be allowed to leave. BUT I also received a notice that 3 bills were once again set off to a collection agency. I called the collection agency & they are once again setting up an investigation. I called Marian yesterday & they promised me someone would call me back. No one has called me back. (March)

Edit 4: I've been leaving messages & getting the run around for the past month. It has now been 10 months since I went to the ER and still I'm dealing with this. No letter confirmation, no one calling me back, 3 bills still on hold at collections. Wish I could give negative stars. (April)< /Review>< user_name>

One problem, no one was very definite about when I would be able to receive the 2nd shot.  This business about being able to wait up to 6 months is not reasuring. It does not coinside with all the info put out there by the medical experts. I'm afraid it will be too long in between shots and I'll have to start all over again. I called the hospital but their explanation was certainly not helpful. I hope I get some answers soon.

Most of the staff has been excellent. (Only reason I gave two stars.) However, maintenance and security ARE issues. Wife had a baby during Covid. They won't let the spouse back in after they leave. So sleeping at the hospital, they provided a junk pull out chair couch. Completely tweaked my back because it is absolute junk, not flat, not put together correctly and missing screws. After several days of complaining they brought in another hospital bed.

Another issue is they have no where to store personal items, except in an open hallway, while your baby is born. The thermostat in the room after delivery was going hot/cold/hot/cold. It was falling off the wall. After 3 days of them promising to have someone fix it, I had enough. I pulled it, rewired it correctly and then left it hanging as it was, as it is broken. I can't believe that those types of temperature changes are conducive for patient healing, or the health of a new born.

I have food allergies, they did make an attempt to accommodate that. Only problem was they would only bring me about 600 calories of food each supposed meal. All they could offer above that was cheese sticks. Or to have someone deliver food.

I know it is Covid but seriously... This hospital is very lacking in personal security, can't seem to maintenance their rooms, or provide sleeping arrangements that are acceptable for the spouses. If you have food allergies, do not count on them being able to adequately feed you.

Definitely never coming back! French hospital is far superior to this facility.

EDIT: Seems they do monitor the Google ratings. Not 30 minutes after I posted this, they at least sent someone to fix the thermostat. It is now on the wall correctly, but still not working correctly.< /text>

I would reccomend going ANYWHERE but here if you can. I went in with left side pain. And was sent out with the very simple diagnosis of back pain and a scrip for ibuprofen. The doctor talked to me as if all I wanted was pain meds. I was,  and still am a week later in pretty major pain. He suggested I might have kidney stones and I had a CT scan. He popped his head in the room and Said the CT was clear we will send you home with a prescription of naproxin (ibuprofen). I said I'm in a lot of pain...thats the only thing you think it could be? He seemed frustrated that I would challenge his diagnosis...he says ok we will try something else and walks out of the room. He had ordered an ultrasound. I'm not really sure why but a nurse came in after the ultrasound and said he was standing in for the doctor to give me the results from the ultrasound...he said something to the nature of... since you aren't in agreement with the doctor, he sent me. I was told ultrasound was clear and this time given exit paperwork stating I had a lumbar sprain. I've continued to be in pain since I left. Just yesterday I logged into my account to look for myself at the imaging reports. I HAVE DIVERTICULITIS!! It's clearly stated on the CT report in the conclusion section. After a quick Google because I obviously have no idea what that means...all my complaints/symptoms match, which makes perfect sense...oh and it clearly states DO NOT take naproxin/ibuprofen which is the med he offered for my pain. If the doctor would have spent a little more time...I could have been on my way to feeling better already. If untreated this could have turned into a need for surgery. Please I urge you don't go here! And if you must...please advocate for yourself and double check your doctors work.  I can't imagine how many patients like me, left in pain with no answers... to only get worse after leaving and needing to spend more money and time with another doctor to get answers.< /text>

My personal experience at Marian Regional emergency room has not always been Pleasant. I suffer from a very damaged cervical region of my back and I had not gotten any kind of pain relief can any doctor anywhere due to pre-existing conditions. So, that means if I go to the emergency room I am really really hurting! Take all that and couple it with the trauma of losing my mother and having PTSD from it all and flashbacks of the emergency room, it takes an act of God for me even want to go there. This last time I was at Marion I was in tears entertain and my blood pressure was through the roof and I was stop. At the kindness of the doctor that treated me that that day, he treated me like a human being. This is not always been the case at Marion so I want to give kudos to dr. Schwartz for helping me< /review>

My husband and I were fortunate to recieve our 1st Vaccine at the Marian Civid Vacvine Tent on Cypress 22 January 2021. We were very impressed with how well organized the Vaccination was. It began with help getting parked. It was raining and parking personnel used a large umbrella to get us to the Registration table. The Helpers there answered all questions and assisted with the paperwork. We were then moved on to the Vaccination tent. The shots were painless and quick ... the PAs, RNs, INterns, and Doctors were so caring and helpful in explaining every step in the vaccination process. We were the moved on to the Waiting area to ensure we had no reactions. There was coffee, watesnacks small snacks. The entire process took about about 35 minutes. Looking forward to receiving our 2nd vaccine next week.. THANK YOU DIGNITY ... JOB WELL DONE!!!<//Review>

Was not going to rate this place but after my last visit I was shocked with the treatment my mother and I received. Went in around midnight because my mother was experiencing symptoms of a heart attack. First off the nurses at the ER are extremely rude. As we were waiting they were just on their phones and chitchatting with the security guards, which leads me to my second point. I witness a security guard tackling down a  harmless teenager with extreme and excessive force while the nurses just watchEd and one even smiled. That is not acceptable and I wouldn’t be surprised if a law suit happens against the maltreatment from the workers to the patients. Lastly I over heard nurses talk about “ looking up” on the internet the symptoms of a patient. If you are a nurse at an ER you must know your job and how to do it. I don’t trust this place with non of my family member’s health. If other people are considering to go to this hospital save your self the maltreatment and attitude from the staff and go somewhere else.<//Review>

The emergency staff was great. Was attended to immediately.
I was hesitant about being admitted because of the current Covid situation, but the doctors highly recommended I stayed so I could get further tests done the following day. If I left, those important tests would not be available to me at the hospital as an outpatient.
I was moved into the okd section of the hospital.
My room was quite,. I was very surprised that the Covid patients were throughout the hospital, thinking they probably had been isolated to one area of the  hospital.
Because of that information, I tried to keep my door to my room closed as much as possible.
The care I received was wonderful.
The day nurses were exceptional and I observed very generous act of kindness by the nurses fir a dementia patient in the next room that was distraught. She went and watched a tv show with him, talked with him, and gave him some personal time to help settle his anxiety. It was so kind and it did not go unnoticed.
The evening nurse , Taylor, was also gentle and kind as she entered the room in the middle of the night to do the needed vital checks.
I have no hesitation about recommending or if needed  to return to the hospital in the future.< /text>

<review>I came in thru the ER on 10/26/20 , I was horrified and thought I was having a heart attack . Scared, anxious and in pain , the compassion and quick care I was given was excellent! Sam. Rosa, Ken, Peter , Dahlia I believe were the names of my ER nurses. I came in at about 6:50 am right as shift change was about to happen. These nurses worked amazingly as a team to see that I was taken care of ! ( I think Ken, nightshift started my IV before be left , very nice and gentle technique! Dr. Novan?? Was my admitted Dr, over the next couple days she was working to find out what
was going . Excellent Care, Dr Mcloskey took over and eventually there was a diagnosis! She is amazing as well!! Here are names I scribbled down to thank at a laltet date . Julissa, Aman, Marianna. Esme - telemetry,. Jerica, Vanessa- Medsurg. Jon-US, Eric-  nuclear medicine, Mary- Food Service, Nikki-staffing, All phlebotomists, EVS , Case Manager - Tele .

My 90 yr old, sight impaired, fragile Mother was sent to ER for some bowel issues and was ultimately admitted for 2 overnight stays. She was given excellent attention from the 4th floor staff including Alexa, Matthew, Lori and Vanessa. I want to thank everyone who assisted her with bathroom habits, nutrition and general comfort. It matters. Good on you, Marian Regional Center!!</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I was in Emergency Saturday night to take my son to get a narcotic drug prescription. The doctor couldn't believe all the issues he had gone through because of a hospital negligence he had experienced in another state. Well Monday morning he was on his way back to ND and he had blood in his urine, he called his doctor in ND and told him to have emergency check him out before he leaves. Well after the doctor cleared him to go ahead and travel back my wife told me she upset with a male nurse. What my wife did was dropped off my son at the door while she went to find a parking space. As she walked in she found my son walking to the room where he he gets his blood pressure checked and as she passed the male nurse she overheard him complain to another nurse that my son was a drug abuser that was there the night before getting a fix and back again getting more drugs. I asked my wife why didn't she say anything to me before and she said she knew I would confront them on it, which would of been true. I have had bad experiences here and don't like making bad reviews but this finally warranted a bad review. This hospital needs to talk with their people. If they have issues with customers or feel they want to denigrate customers then they need to go into a closed room where no one is able to listen. Marian hospital has good people, but for one or 2 people to ruin a batch of good personal, well is it worth it.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I was in the E.R. On July 5th. I went in for vomiting nausea. The nurse that I had did not wear gloves or a mask and Physically assaulted me. I have wounds from her nails digging into my skin. I'm a diabetic and hope I don't get an infection. The young short chubby security guard I think his name was Matthew also assaulted me by Grabbing my beard and slamming my head repeatedly and broke one of my teeth. I tried calling to report them to a director and left a message. The discharge Pharmacist called me back. I started to go off on him then realized he wasn't who I needed to talk to. Still waiting to hear back. I'm wanting to press charges for the assault. I will never return to this hospital and do not recommend anyone to go here unless you want to be hurt more than when you went in . I give MINUS 5 Stars... UPDATE I was told nothing and promised the medical report so I could have said nurses name along with the security guard that were involved with the assault. Still waiting for an email or phone call but nothing going to the D.A. office Monday morning also seeking a lawyer</text>

I don't appreciate being hung up on right after requesting a supervisor. I informed the hospital I wanted to be seen in ER room and want to confirm medi-cal from Kern county would be sufficient. I had medi-cal card number and rep on phone was saying I can't be seen without card and go to Kern county where its issued to receive new card (which is mailed out). What if my visit was life threatening. Last time I went to this hospital I was told "we don't help your kind." That was approx a year ago.< /review>

Still trying to get the billing to send the billing with proper coding to correct insurance.  The E.R. visit was in June 2019 & now February 2020.  The billing office was zero help!  The Doctors & lab all billed correctly, only the hospital can't seem to get it right.< /text>

Dr.Gidney was able to perform an ablation on my heart which was successful in restoring my heart to a regular heartbeat. I thank God , Marian hospital, Dr.Gidney, and his team for bringing healing to my heart. Praise God  ! If your heart is in afib(irregular heartbeat), I would encourage you to come to Marian hospital and make an appointment with Dr.Gidney and hopefully you will experience what I did. Again thanks so much for your medical excellence.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1593035052337, 'text': 'Thank you, Reginald!

I am shocked and dismayed at the behavior of  these "professional" doctors and nurses!!! I have NEVER EVER IN MY LIFE seen and experienced such disregard of the Hipocratic Oath...What is the first line??? First, DO NO HARM!!! APPARENTLY NOONE THAT WORKS THERE IS FAMILIAR WITH IT, AND WHAT IT MEANS!!! HOW SAD...<//Review>

Marian has sure gone down hill since the sisters quit running the place, now its just big business, but you
wealthy community members that like to show off
how much money you have ( trust fund fools ) keep
attending the fund raisers, the 30g concert tickets
really helped out ( bonus' for the big wigs ) but it
sure made some people look like fools, its an ongoing joke around the facility.
Radiology doctors have left,  the best OR director
is now gone, she'll be better off. The caring CEO was
replaced a couple years ago, shame cause she liked
the staff concerns on patient safety and welcomed
staff input.
Infectious disease is a major issue and there are
some serious issues going on at Marian. Keep an
eye out on social media as the law firms are
checking into the issues.
Will post more issues as they are getting reported
by staff, thank you caring staff for your concerns.

When you see an ad or freeway billboard just
laugh cause there a joke.

If possible head South to Santa Barbara to Cottage
hospital if you want great care and a focus on patient safety. They take staff concerns serious.

Oh and check out your favorite social media sites
for upcoming updates.

Take care and stay safe my friends,

Absolutely gorgeous facilities.  Archetechture superb.  Very well secured for safety of patients and staff.  A walking path.  Beautiful fountains and sculptures.  Very quiet and quaint like home.  Like a living room.  Not to mention the easily accessible electronic car charger ports.  Wonderful place. Can feel the love and spirituality.</review>

<Text>I wish that the induction process was smoother. You’re “on-call” once you’re placed on the list and your date can change based on priority. I went into labor on my own waiting for an induction...which I guess is a good thing however I waited in the list for several days before then. Triage in labor is slow. Mother baby rooms are great once you have the baby... nurses keep checking on you every 5 minutes. Was more tired there than at home bc Everytime I Close my eyes someone was showing up in the room. Wish that the state was more relaxing for moms. Labor is Tiring and sometimes we just want to sleep.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

My wife Kathy came into the ER Saturday night with chest pain.  Determination was made bypass surgery was needed.  Surgery was completed and now she is in recovery; we hope she can go home Monday.  EVERYONE ..... EVERYONE; from housekeeping too nurses, technicians and surgeons have been “GREAT”. Our experience has been WONDERFUL, yes there were a few small problems; but with the number of people receiving services; you have to expect some. But, staff consistently are asking how they can improve services.  Staff made sure my family and I were informed on my wife’s progress and convertible. “Thank You”</review>

This hospital is the worst! There are a few nice people but for the most part, they all suck. The people in the ER especially the doctors, don’t seem to care or want to help anyone. Just in it for money. They tell you to go see your regular doctors but then you can’t even get into to see your regular doctors. Our medical system needs a huge overhaul! They aren’t helping patients, they just want money and insurance money. They don’t actually want to do any kind of real work or help. It’s so sad. Every time I go there I get the run around. The staff when you first come in are pretty nice and helpful, but the doctors? Wow how pathetic. Inside the hospital, most of the areas aren’t that bad. Lab and other areas have been really nice. Honestly it’s just the Emergency room. I’ve heard so many terrible things about this place and it’s so true. I also know a lot of people who refuse to go to MARIAN. I am also one of those. Only the emergency room. I will drive to another hospital.< /Text>

<text>I was brought by ambulance into ER, my heart was beating 189 beats a min. I had 12 people working on me . The dr and nurses were kind and told me everything they were going to try and do to me. They got me stable I was sent up to critical care , I spent 6 days there and my only complaint was the food! It was cold and awful they ask me what I did and didn’t want but couldn’t get that right no matter what . They really need better food avail . The nurses station should have condiments ie salad dressing and etc. The Nurses were attentive and kind. I would definitely go back if need be.< /text>< pics>

Absolutely shocking and terrifying place. The staff is actively cruel to pretty much everyone. It’s a kafkaesque scene in the ER. Building is falling apart, security guards are dressed like they’re at a military base and nurses and clerks snicker at suffering patients openly. Waited 3 hours in the ER for a serious condition. Do not under any circumstances come here. This is the kind of place where people without empathy find jobs.< /text>

Okay. So we went in to get my dear friends shots and we were being forced to answering questions such as “ does your child play with guns” “ have your child some drugs such as cocaine “ we don’t find those needed and they were FORCING us to fill out this sheet of questions. They began to be rude to us and tell me what I can and cannot do! This is not professional and disrespectful. After refusing to do the things they wanted me to do, they treated me terribly without respect. I was in here for 2 hours just for my friends shots? Unbelieveable. And they have told me “ nicely “ to stop recording, when I was never recording. never will I come back. 1 star rating!<//text>

Wish I could give ZERO stars. Spent 4 hours in the er tonight. I waited 3 hours in the waiting room, while everyone else got called, only to find out they forgot about me. Then when I asked if they forgot me, I was told there was a room ready as they frantically dug to the bottom of the stack to find my lost paperwork. Then they put me in the supply closet with no bed, where I waited 45 more minutes to be seen. Finally they sent a physician's assistant, not even a real doctor, to diagnose me. She informed me she would put in my orders for treatment immediately since I'd been waiting so long, and was in a lot of pain. Then proceeded to the next three patients before ever turning in my orders. This place is a JOKE. Next time I'm just going to make the hour drive to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where they don't neglect and mistreat their patients.<//text>

I waited 3 hours to be treated like garbage by the doctor. Who told me that basically it wasn’t an emergency that my arm was going numb once a day. She talked to me like I was dumb and I had no right to be here. Super not thrilled with any of the experience. To add.... currently going on 17 minutes waiting on discharge papers. There’s like .. 3 people in here. Not understanding why any of this is taking so long. I would appreciate a “hey it’ll be a few more mins” etc. it’s 9 pm, I haven’t eaten because they instructed me not to, and I’m tired.<//Text>

<review>I will start by saying my next baby will born elsewhere! Went in after my water broke they sent me home saying I must have peed I knew that was not the case they wouldn’t listen wouldn’t give me an ultrasound to check my fluid levels. Went home contractions kicked in. Went back my Dr met me there and she made them admit me. After having mixed experiences with the nurses some were great some not so much. I eventually developed an infection .... why you ask from my water being broken too long..... (insert eye roll) so if they would have listened to me this could have been avoided?!? Cool! My sons heart rate shot up, which led to an emergency c-section. Thank god my son was perfectly healthy! I had to have an unnecessary surgery because they didn’t listen. My Dr’s were Dr Yin & Dr. Crisp Dr. Crisp performed my c-section he was amazing the whole time as well as my night nurse Ashley! We had her every night of our stay and because of them two and one other nurse who’s name I didn’t catch... I’m giving at least two stars. I reached out to the head of labor and delivery more than once and have not heard back. My son is now 5 months old haha so I repeat never returning to Marian. Save yourself the trouble and drive to Santa Barbara or San Luis ladies.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I've had multiple visits to loved ones (maternity, telemetry, CCU, ICU) at this hospital as I grew up in Santa Maria and it's the only game in town. The facility has undergone a major renovation and looks absolutely beautiful, they have a decent cafeteria, family waiting rooms are comfortable, all equipment is new and cutting edge. The staff and volunteers are overwhelming kind and professional though there are a few bad seeds and your experience will likely vary depending on who takes care of you during your stay. The best advice I can give you is to keep on top of your loved ones medications, needs, and plans for discharge/transfer. This is the most challenging part of being in a hospital and while they are supposed to coordinate all the different care being provided on your behalf I found a daily need to advocate for my loved one. Don't assume it is being taken care of, ask lots of questions and make sure you are getting the best care possible.</review>

Housekeepers at the E.R do a horrible job on cleaning. Floors are very sticky it's obviously that no one is mopping the floors. It's just gross one star thanks to the cleaning crew 😒..but the service here is great doct. N nurses are awesome. 👏😊👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️ I'd give only them a 5 star.<//review>

I received a survey for a time I was never seen by a doctor, lab, etc. When I tried calling to get it sorted out, no one answered then when I finally got Deanna Buelow on the phone, she said they would look into it. Now it's been over 6 months without any contact even though I've tried multiple times.... very unprofessional!<//Text>

This is my home town, and I am almost 80 years old now. My experiences at Marian stretch back to childhood tonsillectomy and other ills of youth through a hysterectomy/appendectomy, and a triple coronary bypass. My mother in her last years was hospitalized for blood clots in her lungs twice. In all cases we were cared for perfectly and with concern for our general well-being. I can't, in all good conscience. give Marian Hospital, in all its incarnations, less than five stars.</Text>

The Volunteer Service Director, Ami, is very intimidating, also very rude. Has a bad vibe when her presence is around. Should be switched to somebody more caring and kind.

<text>I sat in the billing office for 40 min waiting to be helped. Apparently their billing system was down. They knew why I was there since you need to sign in and circle the reason. There were staff members walking around behind the glass and sitting at their desks, not helping anyone, conversating etc. Not once did anyone come and say, "I'm sorry our billing system is down, would you like to wait, or would you like to return at another time?" I could've easily sat there for over an hour, and no one would have said anything. Very unprofessional. Very low customer service, and courtesy. The only reason I knew their system was down was because as I was leaving, I heard them say, "Our system is now back up and running." And the much more courteous staff member at the front desk let me know as well, as I was exiting the hospital, as she apologized for my experience. This is not my first experience in this same department with the same type of issue/treatment/lack of courtesy/ease of taking their time.</text><GmapID>0x80ec6c8cb133b971:0x28883595b2c44a23<//GmapID><response>None</response>< Name>

My daughter has been having cotractions every 2-5 minutes for 48 hrs. She was at 1.5 cm two days ago. She's at 2cm today with contractions but yet, they sent her home 3 times in 48 hrs. Even after her mucus plug out yesterday, they will not induce labor due to their polices. What purpose? All my kids were born in Fresno, and never have I seen this! Her suffering is heart breaking. Avoid by all means.< /review>

Excellent care!!!   From the E.R. to the 4th floor, every single person that attended us, treated us with dignity and respect.  We were never ignored or spoken illy to.  From R.N. Michael in the E.R., to Dr. Herrick, Dr.Reid, R.N.'s Katherine and Elda on the 4th floor, they all made sure my daughter was comfortable throughout her surgery.  I was even able to stay with her at the hospital throughout everything (Mon-Fri). Thank you Marian Hospital for providing the best health care ever!!😀</Text>

Run for your life. They refused to do heart procedure on me because i am elderly and live alone and have no one for a driver. They called security and i was assaulted by security for getting emotional and crying at their heartlessness. It occurred on 5-14-18< /review>

I am trying to register my son for an EKG. We had signed in at the registration desk at 305 pm with 2 employees working and 2 people waiting ahead of us. 30 minutes later,  I am still waiting to register. Horrible and inefficient customer service.< /Text>

This coffee shop serves the best coffee, and the desserts are to die for! I love the aromas, and the food was great. It doesn’t matter whether you have breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and you will enjoy it! The servings are enormous, and everything is always very fresh. The venue has a cool vibe with college kids working in study groups and tourists stopping in for a bite.< /review>

<Text>I had a great first time experience at Crave. I happened to go at a great time when it was quiet and not busy. I ordered the rainbow bagels which look really cool. My kids loved them!  They're cold brew with vanilla cream was 👌. I will definitely be going back!</Text>< Pics>

Considering the shop looks trendy AF I had to come and check it out. The vibes were good, was welcomed immediately after walking in and after asking a couple questions I decided to order a suggested drink. I got an Iced Dirty Chai with an added scoop of Vanilla Power which was soo good! Highly recommend it and will definitely be coming back soon.<//Review>

<Review>I came to pick up an order that was meant to be picked up by 9:45am, arrived at 9:36 there was 2 customers ahead they got charged and served then another customer comes in and orders gets her order and leaves then 2 more customers show up she starts to make their order an i ask when will mine be ready and she says its coming up then i say its already 5 minutes late and she says you arrived 5 minutes early even though its already 9:50am i ask 1 more question. Why have they bin taking orders and making me wait she replys customers are first doordash last and i ask isnt the order im picking up for a customer and she replys i dont have to explain myself those are owners orders and told her other employees not to talk to me very disrespectful i order from here through doordash 4 or 5 times a week never ever again will i order from here i always buy from small local shops but this one is not one i will keep delivering for or ordering from. Keep in mind those doordash orders come in few minutes before the driver gets it so they had atleast 35 minutes to make 2 coffees i understand if it was busy which it wasnt but also remember there is a customer waiting for there order even if its through us they are still paying for your food. Btw i have to update the customer if the order is going to be late and give a reason why he was not pleased.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I went in to order but needed to use their bathroom. They refused and would not make an exception for an emergency. I loved this place. So sad. Never going back again. Staff should have enough smarts to gauge exceptions plus this is an excessive feared-based policy, not science based.< /review>

First time here was early Saturday morning. It is a really nice set up. Love the style, group of guys having a meeting outside, a girl came in with books and got her "usual" so they seem to get to know customers which is nice. I only order a make your own bagel. It was really good, but a bit pricey. I have get to try the coffee, but I will be back.</text>

The only thing that was a bit disappointing was that there wasn't any snacks, muffins, pastries or sandwiches to go with the drinks. I was there mid day on a Sunday so maybe they were out, but I didn't see any cases set up where they would have been?< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Stopped in while in the area with my daughter. The coffee shop is so cute! Plenty of delicious food and drink items to choose from. We took advantage of some comfy chairs, ordered our drinks  and chatted away, while we charged our devices. One thing tho, I was taken back a bit by one of the workers who was wearing a crop top and super tight jeans( is there a dress code?)The vibe I'm thinking is to make one feel at home but that outfit she had on or lack there of one, made me cringe! Unexceptable! But everything else was fabulous. ☕< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>116594853693738864917<//UserId.>< pictures>

<user_name>Darth Neph<//user_name><Rate>3< /Rate><review>The place changed pretty much only the Sign when they purchased from Lift Coffee so let's be real when it comes to who to thank regarding  the decor. Went 2 weeks after it was opened and the beverages we purchased were below par with any of the Coffee places surrounding it, including the chains. Tried a couple breakfast sandwiches and Helen Keller could have made it better. Bland and even boring to stare at. The taste was a mix of couch cushion and Communion wafers that you obtain from Catholic Mass. Tried this week to go around 0630 and the place doesn't open tell 0700. A coffee shop that opens at 0700 is maybe good for a busy house wife wanting to get something after dropping the kiddies off.....If you can find the place ! 😉< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcb1880b9f4a3d:0x551d706b49167562< /gmap_id>< Resp>

Because then you would have known that the shop was gutted out and all replaced 100% with all new built ins cabinets, glass , all custom hand made tables . Brought in food equipment. You would have known lift did not sell food. We did not buy lift ... their lease was up.. nothing was left from lift .. since your a lift fan you would known that the only thing we kept was their open hours 0700 . 😎'}<//Resp>

<text>Trying out Crave. Always worries me when a coffee place has no idea what a cortado or Gibraltar is. Also bugs me that they only have to go cups.
The espresso isn't bad. Has a nutty and cereal finish to it. The milk is all wrong, poorly steamed and too much froth.
Better than Starbucks, not even close to Augies or Arcade.</text>< Pics>

Staff was super nice!! It's a perfect little coffee shop to grab a bite and go some homework or just relax. Bagel was delicious and so was the chai.</review>

I recommend the Funky Monkey blend if you are into peanut butter, chocolate and banana. Very rich taste!</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Coffee was great food was good too! So I work for starbucks but love trying smaller coffee shops whenever I travel really liked this place. I came in around open on a Friday morning and was surprised to only see one person working. That's tough on just one person and we rolled in with a full car. It took awhile but we weren't in a rush and it was worth the extra few mins for good quality!</Text>< user>

A little disappointing honestly. I was very excited to try this place, I love the environment. Unfortunately, I was not greeted when I entered the building, nor was I greeted at the register. It wasn't very clear if there was a specific way to form a line so I just walked to the register where there was one girl. The employee just stared at me until I spoke. The menu isn't too hard to read but it is hand written in chalk with some cursive so it gets a little sloppy but still visible. The bagel sandwich I ordered (plain bagel, egg, tomato, and avocado) was fresh and tasty. I also ordered a nitro cold brew and after ordering the girl just kind of made a noise and walked away, when she came back she informed me it isn't working at the moment and offered a regular cold brew. I declined and took a dirty chai latte hot instead. It came out after my sandwich but is very tasty. I will give this place another try at a different hour and hopefully I will see better result. Overall it seems to be another cozy coffee shop for college students to do some work or to meet with a friend. The lighting and overhead are all gorgeous, lots of wood and warm tones, with a strange splash of beach house. They're still figuring it out but only 3 stars for now.</review>

Very poor customer service. First time I went the barista was not friendly at all. They also got made my iced chai a hot beverage. Second time I had to wait 5 minutes while the 2 baristas talked and laughed in a corner about something amusing on their phones. Then when they finally came to take my order, they were out of all bagels except blueberry... Would not reccomend this place to anyone.<//Review>

The atmosphere was awesome! I got an iced charcoal mocha which was delicious! But my friend got a traditional macchiato and it was made incorrectly. The espresso was pulled for much too long and a huge dollop of over steamed milk was spooned on the top. Expecting a speciality drink from a labeled speciality coffee shop, baristas should be trained on traditional drinks. The barista was very friendly though and our service was quick. Just wish the coffee was better quality.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>My sister and I have been renting a home with Invitation Homes since July of 2020 and have have nothing but the best experiences with them. Their maintenance is always quick and all the maintenance employees are so kind and helpful. The main reason for me writing this review though, is to commend Melinda. She has gone above and beyond for us. I was laid off due to COVID, and it has been the most stressful time of my life. Melinda was there every step of the way to assist us and she has made this time 1,000 times easier. I can’t recommend Invitation Homes enough. 💓< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1620412392259, 'text': 'Thank you so much for sharing!'}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fair, honest, and responsible. Carrie took care of us right from the start and was wonderful to work with. Their policies are fair and easy to understand. Their repair and maintenance staff are responsive and knowledgeable. Carrie always replied to my (many) questions quickly and politely. I would not hesitate to rent from Invitation Homes again. :-)<//Review>

The tile in the kitchen popped up the weekend before Christmas, 12/19/20.  They sent someone to check it out and recommended it all be replaced.  They left and we haven't heard from Invitation Homes at all regarding what they plan to do. It is now 1/9/21 still no communication from them<//Text>

He was fabulous on the process of letting me know what takes place in having the entire fence replaced.  Very informative worker.  He also secured some points of the fence that were quite wobbly.  I appreciate all he did & helped me be at ease.  Continue the great work Rolando.  You ROCK!!< /review></record>

Dave, the technician from invitation Homes was very friendly and knows what he's doing. He very well explained everything what we need to know. On our walk through we saw some window screen  that are needing some attention and he made a work order and after 2 days someone from third party came and fix it though there is one left screen that they didnt fix yet. Dave remembers my mom from our previous place which also under invitation Homes property.  I would recommend his service.  5 stars for him.☺️<//review>

<username>Shawin Dubois</username><Pics>None< /Pics><text>Alex M. who has attended maintenance concerns to my home previously continues to be timely and informative. He not only arrives during the scheduled time, but use the system in place to alert estimate arrival. This has ensured my readily welcoming of his/their arrival to complete work order.

As Alex access the concern he shares what his discovery and offer suggestions on how the matter might have happened. This also helps to avoid service needs in the future for same or like issue. Even then Alex gives tips on how to self-repair should it be possible. This is help for a quick fix and avoid the wait; however, when need arrives the schedule is met. This yields the issue(s) resolved and the respect given while servicing my home.

Alex and others on the Invitation Homes (Northern Cali) maintenance crew are dependable and knowledgeable of their trade as they respond.<//text>< UserId.>

My husband and I are relocating to Northern California and had such a difficult time securing a rental. We found a great rental through Invitation Homes and received immediate contact from our Leasing Agent David. He was honest, helpful, and responsive. We received excellent service and have had nothing but a positive experience!</review>

I just recently moved in and my leasing agent, Shelby, was the best! She was so helpful with all of my questions, and very responsive. It was a stressful move all around personally, but she made the process so simple and was able to ease all of my worry. I could feel that right off the bat, I was in great hands with her. I don’t know what I would have done without Shelby! Then when it came time for the move in inspection, I met Dave. He was absolutely great as well! Very thorough and helpful during the pre-inspection and orientation. He was able to show me every important detail about the home and even what to do in emergencies (water leaks, etc.). This was the most detailed and helpful inspection I’ve personally ever gone through and I’m so grateful for that! This was definitely the best move in I’ve ever experienced and I’m so happy with everything so far. Thank you so much to everyone at Invitation Homes, for helping me through this process and welcoming me home!< /Text>

<Review>I am only a few days post move-in, but so far everything has been great! Rolando provided an excellent walkthrough where he went above and beyond in every possible way. He is an extremely nice person who does a very good job covering all the bases! Kathi also provided great service and helped make sure I had everything taken care of! So far, the smart home service is interesting, and having everything be online has been extremely convenient. I am hoping everything continues to go smoothly!</Review>< Pictures>

Personally I think invitation homes is a rip off..but! Their plumber team is the best! Mainly DAVE, since he has been the main plumber for us.. he’s really good, very understanding and easy to work with! He has fixed our sink issue, shower nob,& toilet. He will not leave you disappointed. Thank you Dave! My husband and I greatly appreciate you<//text>

I’ve had bumps along the road, like everyone, but overall if I need something they fix it. A/C, termites, pests, and minor details most don’t think of. Living in one of “invitation homes” properties has been an awesome experience where I’ve learned how to take care of a home!< /Text>

I refuse to rent from this company again.  They care more about money rather than their houses or tenants.  I moved into a house were more than half of the outlets didn't work, the faucets are so old and broken, the carpet is thin and cheap, half of the kitchen cabinets and drawers are old and broken. The exterior is as joke, it looks awful.  Basically it comes to down to they don't want to update their houses to make them look nice or make sure everything is working properly before tenants move in.  Yet, they want to hike up the rent every chance they get.  I highly recommend NOT RENTING from Invitation homes.< /review>

I would recommend anyone to rent from Invitation Homes. The staff is friendly, they are there when you need them, and they have homes all over the Bay Area. I would not want to rent from anywhere else. Thank you to all the staff at Invitation Homes for being so helpful and always looking our for their tenants. Thank You so very much!!<//Review>

Our garbage disposal broke and they sent someone to fix it within a week. Alex M came out to fix it. He was great. He wore his mask and booties in the house and didn’t take forever to replace it. I felt safe with him here. Not creeped out at all. 5 Stars for Alex.< /Review>

Lupe assisted me with a repair from Invitation Home. My kitchen sink was clogged where the garbage disposal is located. Lupe called me ahead of his arrival to let me know he was on his way. When he arrived he was straight to business but was friendly in the process. He wore a mask and shoe covers, which I thoroughly appreciated! He was professional, knowledgeable and understanding. I am completely satisfied with my repair service. Everything is now in working order. Thanks for such great service!

Alex M is hands-down the best tech that has been out to our house. He fixed problems that previous techs couldn’t (or wouldn’t). He was friendly, polite, informative, and listened to what we had to say. We really appreciate Alex M. Thank you!</Review>

<Text>Terrible customer service and complicated leasing procedure. Impersonal and ineffective communication. Multiple online portals with frustrating login and registration processes. House was dirty when we moved in and had broken blinds. Took weeks to have a maintenance technician come out just to look at the blinds and confirm that they were in fact broken. For some reason the tech thought there was a leaking window, even though I clearly explained the issue was only with the blinds, I even included pictures. Just one example of the terrible communication structure they have in place. Once the replacement blinds came it they scheduled installation for 3 weeks later, which then had to be cancelled and rescheduled because they over booked the original appointment day. All for a very simple repair that should have happened before we moved in. All the complications you can expect from a huge business that has a strong enough foothold in the market that they don't need to care about their customers any more. I wouldn't recommend to rent from them if you can avoid it. I'd be terrified to hire them as a PM if I was an owner.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Alex M really got the job done. Turns out the incinerator had a coin stuck in it, had it fixed in 20 mins. He also fixed my faucet, didn't even know it was broken.  Very helpful and gives maintenance advice. 10/10 commended.< /review>

The lack of communication that occurs between Invitation Homes, their tenants and the vendors they use for repairs/maintenance is frustrating and anxiety inducing. I am a small time landlord and I would describe the overall running of this company as a bunch of SLUM LORDS.

We had a pool vendor just disappear without scheduling a repair but Invitation Homes closed the work order as complete, now I have to start the process all over again. My entire tenancy I have not used the pool but pay maintenance fees for a pool filled with black mold. I have requested complete details related to fees, utilities and charges yet Invitation Homes refuses to produce such documentation. Invitation Homes signed me up for cheaper renters insurance without asking me first, now I am battling their accounting department for a complete refund.

For the love of all things morally and ethically correct in the world do not rent from this company.

As a tenant you will constantly be blamed by Invitation Homes and their vendors for being the problem. This company and the staff I have spoken with in other states, because your local office won't respond, lack the basic understanding of tenants rights within the state of California. I have taken legal advice against this company already and will continue.<//text>

Getting maintenance out with invitation homes is typically a giant pain. This time however it did go smoothly. Lupe came and replaced the carbon monoxide detectors (that never even had batteries in them in the 11 months we’ve been here). He was kind and courteous, in and out.</text>

Sherri and team are fantastic! I was a resident of an Invitation Home for 3 years and in that time they’ve been great to deal with, especially with resolving billing discrepancies without having to jump through 50 hoops of fire - always fair. I’d definitely rent from IH again</text>

Kendra Wheaton is amazing. As a Compliance Manager for a Homeowner Association, communication with homeowners is necessary, especially when the home is a rental property. Ms. Wheaton is always quick to respond with any requested made by the association.

We appreciate her efforts and look forward to continue to work with her in the future.<//Review>

<text>My wife and I rented a home in Fairfield CA.  When we moved in the representative told us no dogs nor cats had been in the house , even though evidence of a big dogs could be seen on the garage door.  The smell of dog/cat urine was evident. We had to have a professional come in and clean the flooring inside the house. I had the garage pressure washed. Neighbor to the right informed us that the previous occupants had three large dogs and one indoor cat.  Once in the house the staff was professional and the maintenance man came out to fix the issues. We had a odor that occasionally would hit us during the hot months, Turns out  they left items up in the attic. My wife and I upgraded the master bedroom closet doors with floor to celling mirror doors,  We upgraded the kitchen cabinets with new hardware that wasn't broken,  We upgraded window blinds. The landscaping was upgraded and well maintained. We added a TV connection to the backyard patio. When we moved, I hired a cleaning company to come in and clean the entire home.  The home was left in better shape than when we moved in.

We were blamed for damages that was already present, Such as the Dog marks on the garage door leading into the house,  A hole that was fixed on a bathroom door upstairs ,  After we moved someone placed wood or something on the side yard and filled the trash cans with debris we were told it was our responsibility to remove it.  We were told they would have to keep the deposit to clean the interior and carpets even though I had it professionally cleaned , but I wasn't surprised .
I later get a bill for another months rent. I disputed that rent and was told it was cleared by invitation homes.

Now 4 or more years later I am getting another notice from Rent Recovery Solutions LLC out of Georgia stating I owe even more. This time attached with a threat.  I am not sure If I am being scammed by this Rent Recovery or Invitation homes.  I will suggest to anyone renting a property to take pictures of every bit of the house before you move in and be present when the guy comes to do your final inspection. I was not because he was busy out of town.</text></record>

This review isn't for invitation hones per se but their plumbers. Had some work done by Alex M and he was prompt, professional, took care of the issues and gave assistance on 1 or 2 other recurring problems while he was working. Overall happy with this aspect of of rentals.</Review>

This review is for Rolando. Had a problem with our irrigation timer and he was able to remedy the problem with a smile on his face. Give this man a raise! He deserves it.< /Review>

<Text>Frederico A came to our house to service our garage. He called beforehand to let us know that he was on his way. I appreciated that he wore a mask and social distanced as best as he could while in our home (we did as well). He worked quickly, professionally, and explained to us what was wrong with our garage and how we could fix it in the future. He also asked if we had any other concerns he could address. Super professional maintenance man. Thanks Frederico!</Text>< Pics>

Very bad. They will increase their rent price every year, this is our 4th year. They are a huge ripoff. Our rent went up $150 in one year. They are inhumane.< /review>

Federico A. did a great job repairing our stove! He walked me through everything he was doing and show me the finished result. He was very professional and even offered to fix a mirror that wasn’t secured to the wall very well. 10/10 and would recommend him!<//text>

Ok this whole experience has been amazing and will always use their services from now on. Mike and Dave were very professional and thorough. They did a complete walk thru and explained everything top to bottom.  Honestly, every property management company should be learning from invitation homes, they have made this experience an absolute pleasure. Thank you.<//Text>

Website opens to blank pages that won't load. Will not accept my username and Password LITERALLY the moment I created my account. Won't allow me to upload the needed documents, like my I.D. or Paystub. I am unsure what the issue is, but I am personally finding these reviews hard to believe based on my IMMEDIATE experience trying to navigate this business' website. Even their "Contact Us" page opens blank and will not load, so I can not even contact them directly.< /Text>

I have no complaints with Invitation Homes. It is scary to read other reviews saying how horrible they are but I have yet to experience this. Yes the rent is usually higher and you are left to deal with spraying for bugs and minor things yourself, and also nothing is ever checked on and if something breaks or there are issues with the house you are responsible for putting in the maintenance request for it.  But I also appreciate the fact that we don't have property management breathing down our necks and let us actually live in and enjoy the home. I put in for our palm tree to be trimmed on 9/10 due to branches falling and hitting our vehicles in the driveway, and to my surprise the work order has already been put in and they will be out to trim it tomorrow 9/15. My emails and questions are always answered promptly. Our home is lovely and was clean for the most part when we moved in. Yes I went over everything and bleached regardless. We will see how the moving out process goes when that day comes. Until then, thank you Invitation Homes.<//Review>

This is truly one of the most caring property managements I have ever seen even though we went through a court dispute invitation homes never lost their humanity through it. Despite the circumstance and the situations they did do an amazing job anyone would be lucky to rent from them. Thank you Brittany Smith-Nelson & Kelly McCavitt for your compassion during these struggling times.<//Text>

I have been dealing with Kathi and she has been very kind and super easy to work with. She responds right away and made the move in process very easy (especially since we were on a time crunch to move out of our last home).
We are still new tenants, but so far we haven’t had any issues.</Text>

If i could leave 0 stars i would. Hands down the worst company i have ever rented from. I rented for 3 years from them, they never checked in. When i needed maintenance on a plumbing issue i was ignored then i paid out of pocket. The front door would not shut properly, also never fixed. Now as im moving out they are charging me for everything THEY did wrong. I wish someone had warned me of this company’s shady, money obsessed dealings before i got involved with them. Now im going to have to take them to small claims court, as if i have the time or money for any of this ):< /text>

Ms. Brackman continues to be of great, prompt and courteous assistance. All the staff at invitation homes, Sacramento County have gone above and beyond for me as a client including Kathi Gaston: real estate agent.

<review>Alex Mallque was very professional. Serviced the flapper on my two toilets. My dishwasher needs service and continuously runs. Alex found what the problem was and put an order in to get the motherboard replaced and also found that the heating element was not working as well. Looking forward to getting this repaired or replaced so we are not washing dishes by hand anymore.
Thank you Alex for your professionalism and during Covid-19 keeping social distancing and having a mask on during your visit.<//review><date>1606152050050< /date>< user>

Alex was very good. Took time to clean and dry the cabinet under the sink, really investigated where the leak came from, found three little holes and the backsplash from the dishwasher wasn’t tight. Glued the drawer that was installed with staples. Replaced the carbon monoxide. Took the hinges off the cabinet to repair later and will request a vendor for the chimney rack. Nice gentlemen. Explained everything to me. Will return and caulk the sink, repair the lazy Susan and to stain the cabinet under the sink. It is damaged.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>This is a review for Lester Estrada. First of all, Lester had a time window between 8 - 12 pm (which I personally dislike for obvious reasons), but to my surprise and delight, he arrived exactly at 8. Good start. He was there to fix the sprinkler system, but to both our surprise, a past worker had completely disconnected the system. Not only did Lester analyze the problem right away, he solved it in record time (meaning he fixed the sprinkler system). He also found another unrelated problem that had gone undetected for years and put in a work order for it. Needless to say, Lester went above and beyond the call and I believe he should be recognized for his excellent service. Thank you, Lester!  Stay safe and blessed.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Federico Alvarez has been to repair 2 maintenance problems I have had an everytime he comes he has been very consistent in get the job done. He is very friendly and answers questions honestly and make sure his work is done properly so the problem doesn't come back. My garage door opener malfunctioned and he did his own research and ordered a new one and installed it. Problem solved.</Review>

Dave was great. Very friendly and diagnosed the problem with our dishwasher(it is very old and the pump was no longer working)  He arranged for a replacement and told us how long we could expect for it to be here with the vendor.  If you get him as your maintenance tech, you will be happy.</review>

<review>Horrible place to rent from! All about their money no matter haw perfect of a tenant you are. They bought out two of my old management’s and it was like renting from the devil! They are slow to make repairs, charge you for lates when it’s their staffs fault, charge you exuberant fees to use their on-line rent pay portal, overcharge you for utilities and refuse to produce original utility bills, and ultimately take fees out of your deposit for fraud reasons like utilities! Please do not rent from invitation homes! I rented with them approximately 3 years of 4. It will be the worst decision of your life even if you are a MODEL tenant! They don’t even deserve a 1 Star.</review>< rating>

<review>Carrie Armanino in the home office Roseville, CA. Is a "BOSS." My family and I have lived in Oakland, Ca. for the past 6-years and every time I have reached out to Carrie she has responded immediately. She is an absolute joy to work with and Invitation Homes is lucky to have her. Can't say the same about them addressing other issues I've had like a sewer issue that took almost a month to take care of that problem. Thank you so much Carrie for your hard work, problem solving skills, and just having a pleasant friendly voice on the phone.<//review><Time>1597882034879< /Time><Response>{'time': 1598656624190, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words!'}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6< /Gmap_id>< pics>

Orland came by today and fixed our garbage disposal, our cabinet as well as our stove top. He was extremely knowledgeable and well mannered. I appreciate him coming and would like to request for him specifically to come back if any other services are needed.<//Review>

We are current residents with Invitation Homes. We are good, responsible renters but have been dealing with issues since before we moved in.
Invitation Homes has made it clear that we don't matter, the home doesn't matter and our safety isn't a concern. We moved into the house which had a yard that was previously incredibly overgrown, the company bush-wacked everything, left it on the ground which was covering up old garbage and broken bottles and told me that it was "as good as it's going to get". Granted I have 4 kids...that large yard was the ONLY reason we rented this house. They left a broken window telling me that "it's just like an outlet, you don't let your kids stick their fingers in it, you'll just need to watch them". I have been appalled and shocked just about every time I talk to someone from Invitation Homes. Granted, they did eventually rake the yard and replaced that window but I had to raise h*** before they would do anything more than give me excuses.
The only people that have been great have been the maintenance workers. Everyone else is an absolute joke.
We have an AC that doesn't cool the house, so I have money pouring out of my pockets in electricity to have the AC running constantly so that I can have a house at a wonderful  80 degrees or more on a daily basis, I have an ant and roach problem, the toilet runs constantly, doors don't align, screens and windows don't seal, among MANY other issues. I'm not picky but I do expect at least to have a house that seals so I don't have bugs and heat coming in.
My property management contact doesn't get back to me most of the time so we still haven't even gotten some of the more pressing items even acknowledged yet.
We were supposed to have gotten a phone call from a higher up and STILL haven't after a week and a half.
I'm just waiting to be here for a year, pay out the a** in utilities just to have them tell me that we need to pay X Y Z for whatever out of our deposits.
DON'T rent from them. It isn't worth it on any level.<//text>

I always have a great experience when Dave comes to any maintenance requests. My animals love him and that makes things so much easier to deal with. I actually prefer Dave over any other tech. Each time I didn't have Dave as a tech, things have to be done 2 or even 3 times to get it done and done right. I've NEVER had that problem when Dave does the repairs. I actually have requested him when I made work orders lately and I'm a little upset that he hasn't been sent out, and crazy enough this last one has had to come back 3 times to complete the job AND did a no show no call on this 3rd attempt just this week. Please send him next time.</Review>

I thought it was a great experience. He came in and asked what the problem was. Found the issue fixed it right away. Clean up his own mess. The guy was great. I would recommend anybody to Invitation homes. I've had Alex in my home before doing work is a great worker. I would recommend his work to anyone. Thanks, Alex M.</text>

Today's experience was a 4.5.  BSM of the Roseville office was very helpful with a situation.  She seems like one of the good ones.

As for their mainitiance team and services I am not a fan.  I was without air condition for 38 day. I put in a request on Aug 20, 2020 and did not have air until September 28th.  I date a total of 6 appointments with AC maintenance teams before the unit was replaced. (the unit was over 85 years old)  This was brutal, we had fires and temperatures over 110 degrees some days.  I have a medical condition that I have to ensure I have clean air and though I shared that information I still had to wait and things for me medically got pretty bad.

But I can say thank you to BSM who worked with me today (10/16/2020) She made me remember there are people out their who will help you support yourself.

Not bad place to rent from, they are a big business though.  Rent was raised from 1950.00 to 2450.00 over 7 years.
They had no problem sending out maintenance men to fix things, problem was they had a contract with an outside agency to staff the maintenance issues,  they guys were awful.< /review>

Today Alex Mallque came over right at 10 as I was told and replaced my light bulb that was over ten feet. He also explained to me how I can run a water line for my new fridge. Alex went above and beyond his job in assisting me when he didn’t have too. Thank you Alex!!</Text>

<Review>I lived in a rental for 3 years with Invitation Homes. I had very little contact with anyone other than Carrie Armanino who is the renewal coordinator.  She was fantastic!  No matter what I needed she always could assist and would provide the best service imaginable.  Always willing to promptly respond or reach out to anyone to resolve my issues.  Without Carrie I know that my experience with this company would have not been 5 stars. In my opinion, she is a top notch employee and deserves recognition for the amazing job she does everyday.<//Review>< resp>

I have no complaints! Every time something goes wrong, they come over and fix it. Easy. Rent is high, but where else in California is it not?  Great house, wouldn't want to leave...

UPDATE:  I had to break my lease, but the staff here were caring and understanding.  They helped me through the entire process.  Luckily, they managed to get another tenant in within 2 weeks, so the penalty to me was minimal.  Overall, my experience with Invitation Homes has been pleasant in almost every way.  I would definitely rent with them again.

P.S. Thank you for your help, Carrie!</Text>

<review>We rented a property owned by Invitation Homes. After we had a tragic death of our mother, we had to cut the contract short and move out because she was paying more than half of the total rent per month and we could no longer afford it on our own. After speaking with the representative multiple times over the phone and notifying them that we could no longer live there due to our financial state they went ahead and charged us for the remainder of the contract in the amount of $8K, instead of charging us an early termination fee plus damages. After receiving the “final bill” we called to ask why the amount was so much, they stated “because we have in the system that you were still living at the property and that we do NOT have any documentation of your phone calls notifying us of your move out or of the move out date.” My friends and family are appalled in this company and their decision to charges us for the 4 more months after we moved out. The most irresponsible thing is the rep. not taking any note of our phone calls stating that we were moving out because of our financial struggle and our mother passing away!!! This Company doesn’t even deserve one star!< /review>< Pictures>

Renting through a property management company can sometimes be challenging but Carrie at the Roseville office really helped us through some difficult lease situations. She always would reply to me emails very quickly with a positive attitude and willingness to help.< /review>

Our rental experience was a nightmare. From high water bills because of sprinkler systems we couldn’t shut off and a constant running toilet that I called a maintenance request in for. Spoke to a human being whom gave me a confirmation number for the ticket and asked that someone be home (A.k.a Miss work) to let the person into the property.
That time came and passed with no word from the company that no one was coming or to reschedule.
At the end of the lease we had to fight just to get half of our deposit back, even after the move out inspector told us we left the unit in immaculate condition compared to what he was used to seeing.
The home also had no refrigerator on site, we had to provide our own, which is pretty unheard of.

Positives: They didn’t charge and arm and a leg for us to have dogs.

Rent was not outrageous but it wasn’t cheap

Overall they were a terrible company to rent through if you like being respected as a renter.< /Text>

Great service and a very thorough inspection by Alex M. I would recommend to ask for him if you can for any work order placed. He explained everything very well how to turn on and off everything around the house in the event of an emergency! Great work Alex M highly impressed with his professionalism.< /Text>

We had a 1 YEAR LEASE. (We) being myself, my 2 adult daughters, & my older daughters bf along with my  2 grandsons. After moving in for ONLY 2 MONTHS we found out from the PREVIOUS RENTER THAT HIS FATHER-IN-LAW ACTUALLY "DIED IN THE HOME" in the bedroom that was my grandson's! His actually room was mine we found this out from a neighbor. 😠We contacted them about WHY THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO US...ONE WEEK went by & since WE DIDNT HEAR BACK FROM THEM we decided to contact them once again regarding the ISSUE... After the SECOND attempt we finally heard back the following day. They said it WAS an OVERSITE on their part, but ADMITTED they did have the DEATH CERTIFICATE in their file! Furthermore, not only are they the rental agency renting this property... it is actually OWNED by them as well!!!! Go figure right!!!! THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE OF A DEATH IN THE HOME IN CA if it has been LESS THAN 3 YEARS!!!! this man passed away in the home in Aug 2019 only 9 months prior to us signing a lease & moving in! How & why would this information be overlooked! My guess is so that they could Get the home RENTED! The house is also not worth the rent they are charging there is MICE & RATS and to top it off COCKROACHES too! Finally as a forewarning to the next person thinking of renting this property 1 week of moving in my younger daughter felt as tho there was a GHOST!!!! Weird VERY WEIRD & CREEPY things have happened after moving into this house too much to list!!!!  I believe it is haunted 100%...we haven't stayed in the home for almost 2 weeks & are in the process of getting all of our stuff moved out because of this BIG MESS & they have agreed to let us out of the lease because THEY FAILED TO DISCLOSE A DEATH IN THE HOME TO US!
What a HUGE inconvenience this has been for all of us involved in this NIGHTMARE!!!!
AS IF MOVING ISNT ALREADY A BIG HUGE JOB & TWO MONTHS LATER HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND MOVE AGAIN IS BS!!!!!! SHOULD BE ZERO STARS!!!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1596041387696, 'text': 'We are very sorry to hear this and have shared your review with the leadership team.

Alex is amazing.  He has been to the property 2x to fix various electrical problems and he always asks questions to make sure he understands the full problem.  Once he finds the problem, he explains it and then tells us what he's going to do to fix it.  I appreciate his professionalism and ability to represent the company well.  Please recognize Alex for a job well done!!!</review>

I have always struggled with the limited availability of rentals in the Northern California area. The way Invitation homes does the application process makes it easier to secure your home. On top of that I had a great experience having Sharon help me with the process of application and move in procedures. She did very well to communicate what I needed to do in an informative way, making it a simple process!<//text>

This was my first time searching for a home and it was a complete roller coaster. All of our applications were getting denied even for a home that I had applied for with invitation homes. But Lisa Ramsey has been magnificent and was definitely able to work with me and my family needs and we have finally moved into our home. There were a few bumps on the road but Lisa was great through the whole process and kept communication with me. Thank you so very much Lisa for helping my huge family officially get into a home. We absolutely appreciate you!</text>

Overpriced, and the rent has increased every year! We started out paying about $2100 per month, and are now, in our 3rd year of leasing, paying over $2500 per month for an old Vacaville home that is nothing special.
The maintenance received while living here has been great. Alex in particular has completed outstanding work. However, the high rent prevents my husband and I from saving money so we can buy a home of our own. We are currently being trapped by Invitation Homes.</Text>

<review>I don’t know where to start I have so many great things to say about this company and the three ladies that made my kids and I get in to our new home!  Thank you so much Kathi Gaston, Tonya Tretter and Alicia Saul! I became a single mom of 3 and sold my home a few months back! On top of three kids I have two cats and a large Doberman as well a a budget! I met these three ladies at a home I was approved for through invitation homes. I was so excited however, the neighborhood was not a good fit for my kids. Kathi, text me daily with other homes they had available. She was personable, sympathetic, compassionate and she really cared that we got the perfect home! She got a call from Alicia and Tonya they found a home that would be perfect for my kids and I as well as our pets we had been denied  several times before due to breed restrictions! Long story short! Within a hour I said yes I’ll take that home and a week later we have keys and are moving in! Every time I text Kathi she responds immediately! Thank you ladies so much! 2019 was rough You ladies gave us a new start for 2020 in an amazing house and beautiful neighborhood!!!< /review><gmap_id>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6<//gmap_id>< pics>

Note to the company: Please don’t respond and act like you’re sorry about my bad experience. I gave the company an opportunity to make things right and they chose not to.

Sadly, Invitation Homes is more preoccupied with getting the most money out of a tenant rather than making quality and honest service a priority. They will make as much money off of you as possible while at times disrespecting your time and efforts. Unfortunately for them, reviews provide honest feedback and a happy customer is worth more than a quick buck. I will not be recommending their business to my friends and family.

Here’s a few things to keep in mind from our experience if you are considering renting from them:
1. There are a lot of random fees and extra add ons. Read your lease carefully.
2. You will be required to schedule a “procare appointment” every six months. For this they only offer a  4 hour appointment window. I scheduled mine on my day off work and they never showed up. No courtesy call or anything. When I called to let them know they missed the appointment, they just said, “okay. When can you reschedule?” I told them I already waited for 4 hours waiting at home and would not be wasting any more of my time. They said okay but then had their manager call me and try to convince me to reschedule. What’s funny about this is if YOU miss an appointment they will charge you a $70 fee. Obviously their time is more valuable than yours.

3. Be aware that upon move out their policy is that the tenant pays to have the carpets professionally cleaned and provide a receipt. They may come through and remodel the home anyway after you pay to have this done. I hired a 5 star upper end company to ensure the carpets were cleaned well. Then a week after move out, I drove by and they were ripping out the carpet that I just paid nearly $300 to have professionally cleaned. When I requested they reimburse us for wasting our money on something they planned on remodeling, they spun the story to make it sound like my dog left too much dander. I’m not oblivious; It was clearly a remodel because the house was left in great condition, although extremely outdated and they wanted to raise their rent price yet again by adding hardwood flooring. They did not remove all of the carpet in the home so if the dander was the real reason, they would’ve needed to remove all of it, not just some.
4. I should also mention that Invitation Homes refused my request to have any kind of walk through prior to move out “due to COVID-19.” I found this interesting considering all the workers that came through after we left. A walk through is a California legal right for a tenant but not even a virtual FaceTime walk through was made available to us during this time.
I could go on explaining my frustrations with them but the fact of the matter was we were treated like nothing more than a fat pay check.<//Review>

Dave & Brooke have been amazing. They both have shown great customer service and have been so very helpful. Brooke has helped me every step of the way and has kept me updated with everything. Dave was very helpful during the walk through at orientation and showed me how to use a few things. I truly appreciate both of you and I am glad to be part of the Invitation Homes Family.<//Review>

<Text>Alex M stopped by to fix issues issues with my microwave, we weren't able to get the problem solved today as he is ordering a new microwave but he was very friendly explained everything to me and set the stage for what I can expect the timeline to be until we have a permanent fix. On his way out he noticed my door was getting stuck when opening it and he made sure to fix it before leaving, despite this not being an issue I mentioned, and him having another appointment to go to. It shows his commitment to doing his job right.<//Text>< rating>

Other than the quality customer service and maintenance care, my wife and I can’t wait to get out of this place. Not only are we paying far above what this house is worth, the auto deposit system continuously has issues taking our rent out automatically. Then the company tries to charge us late fees for their faulty system. Super shady slumlord tactic.</Text>

It was easy to use but I worried the technician wouldn’t come on time or some how not have me scheduled for today which has happened in the past resulting in me taking multiple days off of work which really sucks. This time was different. The technician Alex called me before he arrived and worked on fixing all of my sprinkler issues. He then showed me the ins and outs of using my timer which I only knew the basics on which I thought was super cool of him. He then tested all of my sprinklers to make sure they were working properly. He also sent the rental company pictures of things that could become future issues. For example, a few roof shingles are starting to come up. We haven’t had any issues and didn’t noticed ourselves but he wanted to make sure it was noted and taken care of for us before we had an actual issue. He cared about fixing any issues we had and making sure future issues were prevented for us. Alex was awesome and made this experience easy and convenient for me which I really appreciate!</review><rate>5< /rate><date>1558023914052</date></record>

<Text>I had a billing mistake (being charged for not having renter's insurance, but I did have it and I submitted the proof). They fixed it relatively quickly. It took a few calls, but I think that is more because of the Covid-19 pandemic that is going on than anything else. Thank you, Invitation Homes and thank you, Keandra Wheaton< /Text>< pics>

This is specifically for maintenance received on October 28, 2019 from Lupe. He had some free time earlier in the day so he called to ask if he could come earlier than scheduled, which actually worked out better than the original time scheduled. He also fixed the problem very quickly and as always, was very courteous.</Review>

<review>Everything seemed great at first but that soon changed. Company doesn't care about property or tenants seeing as I've never had success with maintenance or billing inquiries. Company will not respond to my calls or say they will do something and never follow through. Find another property management company.</review>< pictures>

Alex Mallque was very professional and pleasant to work with. He diligently worked to repair all of the work orders.  He problem solved and found ways to repair issues that otherwise would have cost money to be replaced. He was very apologetic for running late and made sure everything was repaired before he left the property. Thanks Alex< /Text>

I really enjoyed my experience with Invitation Homes as a rental company. They are hands off but when you need them, they are there in a jiffy. Very lenient as well. I haven’t moved out yet so I can’t say how willing they are with deposit reimbursement. Jon did my pre move out inspection and he was great. Professional, detailed, and very nice. The only complaint I could have is the maintenance men who have come. They were plenty nice but only come during your work hours so you have to take time off work and a few times had to come back again because they couldn’t fix it the first time so you again have to take time off work. In saying that, the customer service with all other departments is stellar.<//Text>

The most shady part of there whole business is that once I left I was told not come back and that is when I was charged with all of these things. Never do business with this company</text>< Response>

We've been in an invitation home for 4 years now. Every summer the ac breaks and every summer they just patch it. This year we're waiting on a part. Its been 20 days! Me and my kids have been stuck with a house that is 90° INSIDE! They keep calling with updates and state that the "part" will be in in 3 days. Ive gotten that call 3 times now. They act like updating me is suppose to take care of the problem, however im still in a hot house not getting any sleep cause it's too HOT! Once this lease is up, we're out!< /review>

<Review>I had placed a maintenance request to replace a failed light switch that wouldn’t stay on. Maintenance repair technician Federico Alvarez did a great job replacing the defective light switch that had stopped working. He mentioned that other light switches that were popped out were a safety hazard and he proactively replaced them all on the same visit. Great service.</Review><user>100658243904839465917<//user>< gmap_id>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Been waiting on repairs to be done for over 3 months. My roommates and I are college students working full time and going to school full time with very limited funds for repairs and time in our hands to do it ourselves. We have black mold formed in a few rooms that they failed to mention on move in. Upon seeing the mold and calling it in, they sent an apprentice out to look at it and he sprayed some stuff on it, told us it would “minimize the spread” then told us that yes it was Indeed black mold and then poked a hole in our Roof where the mold is and told us it needs to be repaired, then left. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, this seems to be how they handle every repair we’ve needed. It’s been 2 weeks on this case and still haven’t heard back and we’ve called 2 times since..... We had toilets that constantly backed up and basically we couldn’t use and were like this since we moved in and it’s been 3 months and after 4 phone calls and having 2 work orders for it did they FINALLY get it repaired last week.< /text>< user_name>

Whatever you do, DO NOT RENT FROM INVITATION HOMES. In the beginning stages of living with them, they are great and respond to you in a timely manner. However, when it comes to moving​ out time, they will ignore you and not answer you. I have called the corporate office, the local office, and sent numerous emails, and still have yet to hear anything back. Not to mention that they rob you of your money. You will barely get any of your deposit back. I have asked for evidence of the charges that I was charged at move out and have yet to have anything sent back, as well as, I was charged five different times for "utility service fees" even when I was not occupying the house. Please, do not fall into this hell hole of a leasing company. Stay as far away as possible. Terrible company.< /review>

I’ve been a renter for over 5 years. Carrie and Kelly have been very helpful to me and the property has met my needs.  Improvements in the rent payment process has been appreciated and the lease renewal process has been a breeze. My home is a little older than most of their properties and as maintenance issues have come up - which is to be expected in a house built in the early fifties, they have been dealt with in a timely manner.</text>

I can’t say enough wonderful things about Invitation Homes . The application process and getting ready to move-in was a breeze and Robin from the Roseville office was extremely responsive and patient with all my questions. The maintenance and orientation was also great. Steve came immediately to rekey my home and Mike was extremely friendly when he conducted my home orientation. I have had a few maintenance issues and Invitation Homes has been very quick to respond to my concerns. Everyone that I have come in contact with has been kind and courteous. I would absolutely recommend this company!< /text>

We left the house in about the same condition we received it in and were successful in getting out whole security and pet deposit back.  I would recommend!<//Review>

<review>Non-functional website and poorly trained staff. I've lived under several different landlords and never had an issue. Upon moving out of Invitation Homes, we were given just under $2,000 worth of frivolous damages to the home. These costs were all associated with dilapidated fixtures that existed in the home prior to us moving in.<//review>< gmapID>

I have been a renter through Invitation Homes for 3 years in Woodland CA and 4 years with Waypoint Homes which was bought by Invitation Homes.  I have been very pleased with both homes for the past 7 years and look forward to a rewarding experience in my new home.  The staff are very professional and courteous.  Maintenance issues are quickly handled.  My move out Coordinator Mike J. was really helpful, professional and had a great personality.  He was also my Coordinator for my new home and took the time to go over my check point list for my new home to allow my experience in the home to be great.  I love the fact the Invitation Homes have pet friendly homes where your love one can stay.  I love the Procare program which will come out to my new home and change out items like filters, batteries etc. on a quarterly basis.  Great service, and I would highly recommend Invitation Homes to my family and friends!<//Text>

<Text>I’ve been with the company for 5+ years and they are incredible.  The staff is so nice and understanding. Times are hard nowadays and rarely there are companies that have that sympathy for their tenants.   But I can assure you that invitation homes sympathizes with their tenants and are very considerate with any situation you may be in. I would also like to acknowledge this individual as well. Megan Haaby. I emailed her regarding my situation. Not only did she respond so very quickly (which I love btw) but she understood my situation and was able to accommodate me.  She was professional and yet also was very sympathetic. I admire her work ethics. That’s why I give this company a 5 star rating. And would recommend them to anyone that is looking to with.</Text>< pictures>

I have rented for the last 1 and a half years from this company 3 different locations, they have been beyond helpful, my deposit was almost completely refunded to me. They worked with us finding homes, didnt judge us because were roommates, i overall reccomend them, so much better than any prior rental company, repairs were made in a timely matter, questions are answered very quickly by email. I will continue to rent with them until i decide to purchase. 💖<//Text>

<review>John did a great job of doing my pre-move inspection today.

My most significant concern about Invitation Homes Nor Cal involves the outrageous rent increases in the past two years with no tangible improvements to the rental property.< /review></record>

Sadly I found out too late that this company is very shady. The application process is a complete hassle, the site wont work half the time or it tells you that you dont have an account even though you just created it. Mind you, you have 48 hours to complete it or fix anything wrong.

Even if the listing says it's available on the 15th, they dont guarantee that date and it may be much longer.
They want a 500 dollar non refundable deposit on some houses and wont allow you to see the home.

Lastly, we were told not to look at other websites because they are scams, and that we should only use their website.

DO NOT USE THIS BUSINESS!

<text>Invitation homes recently helped us with finding a rental in Northern California. The experience has been nothing but positive. Lisa Ramsey was our leasing agent and she was nothing but wonderful. She always returned emails, calls, and texts. And helped us every step of the way. Thank you Invitation homes!!<//text>< response>

<rate>4< /rate><review>Alex Armenta was awesome. Plain and simple. I admittedly came out if the gate pretty hot about some charges in my move out invoice and he was patient, understanding, and went above and beyond to answer ALL of my questions and even got us reimbursed for some charges we had previously paid. His customer service was outstanding and I couldn’t have asked for better follow through or communication. If we are ever looking to rent a home again, I will try to stick with Invitation Homes because of him.

Due to relocation, I didn’t live long at my residence but in the time I was there I enjoyed the location and property—I only had one issue with an appliance and I feel that maintence was pretty prompt in getting it fixed. The only thing I really hated about my experience was the application process, but the company had recently merged with another so this could have been the reason for that experience.< /review>< pictures>

<user>108197534773628492666<//user><Text>If you're planning to live in one of Invitation Homes house for renting and be aware of this: 1.) Invitation Homes are poor at fixing their homes they own when you move in. 2.) It cost so much to live in one of their houses and not worth the rent pricing. 3.) Their homes rent will go up rapidly too without any noticed. 4.) The company is such a rip off, and they don't care about its renters and just digging out as much money from its renters as they can. 5.) If you call them to do a maintenance, they'll charge you, extra charges too and do very bad job. For my rating, i will give them a 0 star because it is just too over pricing of everthing. As i believed there headqauters is located in Dallas in the state of Texas.</Text><gmapID>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6<//gmapID>< Date>

My ProCare appointment went well! The representative (Lupe) took his time. He showed a genuine concern for the items with which we were concerned. He was professional and focused. I would be delighted if we have for our next appointment. I’m so pleased to have rented through Invitation Homes (IH). From the beginning my experience with this company has been nothing but quality! IH sets the bar!<//Review>

DO NOT RENT THROUGH INVITATION HOMES!!!  We rented a property with them for 5 years, there was always surprise fees in our monthly rents.  Everytime we call to ask, the office would reply and say they'll reimburse our money back, but never happens.  They make you as the tenant, pay for service fees that they use to bill you your rent and sewer, garbage, etc.  Your lease will jump up almost 200 each year.  We finally moved out after our rent was so high, we rather buy.  When we moved out we cleaned the place up really good, mowed the lawns, took out all nails and sealed all the holes.  We were told by the inspector everything's good and to just replace all light bulbs and filters to which we did.  We got a 2600 bill 2 months later stating they had to replace light bulbs, clean the lawn, clean the gutters, take out nails from the wall etc...
we were at fault for not taking pictures!!   Invitation home will do anything and charge you for everything.  They dont care about their tenants.  DO NOT RENT FROM THEM.<//Text>

I guess I should not be so angry because dealing with this company is what lit the fire to buy our new house (BUT) they are all about money!  We rented our  house for over 4 years, we paid a deposit of $2175 and are only receiving back $610.  I asked for an upgrade on carpet because they put in the cheapest carpet you could buy, they refused but charged me $723.00  for carpet cleaning and fraying- I could not believe it.  I also put in wood floors  that cost me over $5000 because the carpet was so bad.  I also put in new blinds and floors in the sunroom, I was told if I left them I would receive my deposit back and still I was charged for everything.  I would have rather taken them and sold them then leave them if I knew I wasn't receiving deposit back.  When we first moved in we were paying $1850, they add the water and sewer  so on average I was paying about $1950 a month.  My final bill for the last month because I was not renewing my lease was over $2600!!!  In my last house I received back every penny of my deposit so this was just a slap in the face when we took such good care of this house and had regular cleaning service every two weeks the whole time we lived there.  I know that there are more renters now and this company makes it easy to get in....but you will be sorry!!!  Besides buying is so easy and its yours!!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>I am going through hardship right now, my wife passed away in February" r.i.p. sweetie I miss you" after that all stuff started going downhill, I needed to catch up on bills we were in a financial situation before all this happened. Just like going from two incomes into one. I got three daughters to race and it's not like I'm too much behind a rent. Just some people have heart nowadays. Almost forgot who I posted there's been to Paris in this house that need to be done since first month we moved in here. We still got a couple for barge that needs to be repaired all the fans in the bathrooms do not work. The power keeps turning off and on and the rooms power don't work.</text>< Pictures>

As he was wrapping up, he asked if there was anything else he should check out before he left. I took a chance and said the dishwasher and toilet, thinking nothing would get looked at but Alex Mallque surprised me and checked out both.

He was very professional, making sure I understood everything he was doing. He showed me how to stabilize the dishwasher, how to check for and clean the calcium buildup and checked the toilet. He's such a polite person, making sure we know how to manage things, on our own, from here on out. He was so kind to say, if anything goes wrong again, just let me know. I would definitely choose Alex Mallque, anytime there's a problem that my husband and I can't fix. Alex Mallque has outstanding customer service. He's not the first Invitation Homes Employee to come by to repair things but he was definitely the best. He deserves five stars for his visit. Thank you Alex Mallque.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1565709746127</Date></record>

It seems like they work in backwards accounting to get the most out of your deposit based on what you have left. They took my deposit all of it and out of the graciousness of their heart they just sent me a final bill of $10 how convenient I guess they didn't want to stick it all the way up my ass they are professional rip off artists company they raised their rent charge you a surcharge everything they do is for profit to keep their company afloat at the price of the common renter. Let me give you an example they charge me $75 for landscaping and 135 for landscaping charges no invoice and the day of the final inspection the inspector was there personally to oversee landscapers and clean up guys do the work and I was still charged.</text>< Pictures>

They are terrible, it's evident from all the low stars. The problem isn't a tenant issue but the company is awful. They have no urgency even on issues that can cause harm to you or your family. They are cheap and will not replace outdated and unsafe items. If you somehow get trapped into a contract.... first and foremost my dearest condolences. Second document and photograph everything and ensure you have a lawyer on standby cause they will attempt to rob you for every nick and cranny in the house even if it was there at move in. I had mold in my house and it's still there. You need to contact the city to inspect it to get them in violation and they will do the bare minimum work and leave it incomplete and attempt to charge you for it not being finished at move out. Just a god awful company they apologize like crazy but it has no meaning. I'd rather cram my family into an apartment then rent a house with this crooked, unethical, garbage company.</text>

<text>Do not rent from this company. They will fee you until you can't afford to live. They have lost mailed payments, payments made on line as well. Then you get a huge late fee and others tacked on. Every year, without fail, they WILL raise your monthly rate. I am not looking forward to the move out process, as I'm sure we won't see any deposit back from them.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< review>
In November, will be a year we have been with this company. The only reason we went with this company is because they allowed our dogs. Almost every month we call maintenance for something and when they come out to "fix" the issue, they basically just rig it so it's good temporarily. I'm 100% the foundation is messed up but don't worry the cracks are normal and I'll fill this huge uneven Crack with sealant. Really? We have the smallest AC unit you can think of that is supposed to be adequate enough for the whole 1100 sqft house. You can tell the AC unit before was 4 x the size of the 1 in it now, Way point informed my husband and I that we are SOL and there is nothing they can do for us. We went and bought portable AC units but unable to run them in the house because the breaker keeps blowing a fuse, don't worry way point isn't going to do anything for that either. It's an older home we aren't going to rewire the whole house or even come and check the breaker. Honestly, I could careless but I have an infant that only can wear a diaper in the house because of how hot it is. It's an as is rental agreement, you basically pay to live somewhere where you do all your own maintenance. Because you literally are RESPONSIBLE FOR  EVERYTHING! I would never rent again or even recommend this company that does nothing. You never get to talk someone at the office, always the call center, who then gives the message to someone else and so on and so on. Oh and as far as maintenance don't expect anything to be done within a few days. It takes a week and you don't get an appointment you get a phone call the day they are available and hopefully you don't have a life and can wait around all day for them to finally show up. Literally a waste of money. If you are willing to pay 1200+ for rent just buy a home. You might as well because you will be doing all the up keep yourself.</review>

<review>Maintenance: Called for them to fix fence that blew over 3 times, and they had a guy come out and look at it, put in a request to repair, and never return to fix it. Thankfully, the fence was repaired by neighbors that bought the house next door.

Had a leaking kitchen sink and they sent out a 3rd party handy man to "patch" it. He fixed superficial damage, but sink kept leaking.

Called to have leak fixed 2nd time, and handy man put faucet on sideways (on purpose), because we questioned his desire to do what the last guy did, "patch" it.

Utilities: Company decided to include utilities in rent and since they use a third party company to process that, there's an added administration fee to our monthly bills.

Rent: When we moved in January of 2017, our base rent was $2125. It went up to $2250 in 2018. Now our rent is jumping up to $2470 in 2019 with a 12 month lease. Over $2900 if we go month to month until our son graduates next summer!

Thankfully, they did negotiate a 6 month with us at $2650 per month. (That's why I gave them 2 stars instead of one). With that being said, still don't know how we're going to scrape by at this rate.

How do they expect people to live like this?<//review><Rate>2</Rate><gmapID>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6</gmapID><UserId.>111656069668761422549<//UserId.></record>

<text>HIDDEN COSTS!!!
If you decide to rent a house from them do your research first. I just wasted 90 dollars on app fees. to find out the house that i thought was gonna be 1,813 a month was gonna be close to 2000 a month since the expect the tenant to pay water sewer and garbage plus other plus other fees that were not listed in the ad. I didn't find out about the hidden costs until after i put in the app and was approved< /text><username>Vincent Maxfield< /username><Gmap_id>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6< /Gmap_id><Date>1557848860321</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>101750143084359429347< /userid><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>Terrible management and in 2 years they have switched property managers 5 times. We have reported rat problems and mold issues and they don't take that stuff very seriously.  I freaked out when a rat was in my living room and I called immediately to report the issue and it took 4 days for someone from pest control to come out. I'm a very clean person and we keep a very well kept home. The rats love the fruit trees in the yard. But, that is not my problem!! It takes a very long time to get anything accomplished through them. They go up $250 each year on the rent. We are definitely moving asap!</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place is so discriminatory and retaliatory. I filed numerous complaints to numerous agencies and they ended up evicting me and my kids. They wrongfully evicted me making it difficult for me to find housing. They really piss me off.
Terrible company, terrible representatives, unprofessional, period.< /text>

< Review>
This company is a joke!  I moved out of their rental property in February 2016.  Fast forward to today 20 months later I receive a phone call from a collections agency saying I owe an additional $319.  No one can explain to me what the charges are for and I never received a bill for it.  I find it crazy that a multi million dollar company can't find the time to send me a bill or call me to advise of the additional charges!  After contacting Jessie at invitation homes today they have all of my correct contact information (email, new address, phone number, and work number). But in 20 months no one could contact me!!!!! Rent from them at your own risk would be my advice to you.</Review>

<text>I was glancing at the reviews and I was really shocked.  I have been renting from Invitation Homes for three years.  I have never had a problem.  My account manager is always on top of things when I call.  Whenever there is a maintenance problem, they are there to fix it with no problem.  I will be renewing lease when it comes back around.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x809ad645fc8a7515:0x300f4596c8839af6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They deserve 0 stars. Every month they charge 200 to 300 dollars for water sewer garbage and when you ask for a city bill they give you an itemized bill they made. They refuse to fix the mold problem in our house and charge a service fee to come out and insect the problem. I have a 6 month old baby in this house but they couldn't care less he's starting to have respiratory problems but if I leave they threaten to sue us for the left over rent.< /Review>

<text>I would never suggest this company any friend or family of mine. I am almost done with my one year contract and the rent was raised extra $200 if I take another one year Lease. If I chose month- to-month, the rent as extra $450.00. The part I hated most about was the maintenance  component as they hire average Joe's to do the job who don't carry licenses/work orders to verify they are there for the job. I had a occurrence where a brother of the maintenance person assigned impersonated to be the "joe" for the order. Once questioned for paperwork and receiving lies after lies. The police came into action as I refused to let the person into my home as he says he doesn't carry his license on himself. The police didn't mind as they were willing to take him to the station to verify his identity. That answer changes quickly as he went back to his truck and for his license. Ended up being being the brother of the assigned worker as I called the agency contractor hired for the work order.

Beware that you have to pay water/sewer/trash, and your deposit will not be close to the amount you put down as they charge ridiculous amounts for "cleaning" , $10 light bulbs, lawn maintenance , and bogus fees.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Please do not make  The mistake I made by renting from this horrible company I have dead rats falling out of my ceiling because they chewed through the water lines. the house is infested with rats and was not disclosed to me I have  photos and video to prove all this. .  To top it off I have not been able to use the bathroom because they have not fixed yet and they want me to take off work to fix their problem.  And offered me nothing in return for missing work or for not be able to use all the property that I'm renting. .  This company is too big  They don't care about any of their renters what so ever and this shows.  .  They also have a policy to raise your rent every single year so please everybody stay away save yourself a headache and maybe some rat s***...   I so wish Google wold let you post photos.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

My family has gone through a tough year and our income unexpectedly changed due to a disability and working with the VA. We were honest with them and upfront, but we were late on some payments. We got caught up and paid all fees attached. 2 days after everything was paid we got a notice to move and xant find a place to go because of invitation homes not giving us good rental references.</text>

Each month expect hidden fees to be added on top of your rent. We were expecting to pay $1330 per month in rent but at the end of the day its closer to $1700 and has been higher then this. Our rent for the month of May was $2200. The worst part about it is I feel like they are double charging for utilities. They claimed we were behind even though they are the ones that bill us. ODD???!

<Text>I scheduled a tree trimming for them to come today between 8am-noon. I called 10 min till noon because no one had contacted me or showed up. I received an email Monday (today is Wed) confirming my appointment stating the the work would be addressed today between 8 and noon and if no one was home during the appointment there would be a $75 charge. I am a single mom who took a half day off work and missed other appointments to be here for the their appointment. When I called invitation homes, the woman I spoke to stated that they still haven't put the bid in for the work even though they sent someone out to my property on Monday to take pictures and said the bid was going to submitted that day so the appointment will still be standing for Wed. Now they told me I would receive another phone call later today for ANOTHER appointment and because it is outside work, I do not in fact have to be home even though their email stated otherwise. Completely wasted half a day of work and all they could say was "we do apologize" .  Not professional at all. It's no wonder they already have such a low rating. Not a coincidence, just poor management and customer service.< /Text>< user>

Absolutely horrible company!!..They raise your rent every year, maintenance is ridiculous and whoever they contracted to remodel my home before I rented it left holes in the exterior..renters beware they do not give a crap about you… All they care about is their money and making it seem like the home is beautiful on the outside but what looks good on the outside is not always good on the inside!<//Review>

<Review>Ya know, I really do understand that people can have a horrible experience with a person, business, company etc. It seems like quite a few people have had that. Thankfully, my experience hasnt been that way. We have been in our house for almost 18 months. Yes, at the end of the first year our rent was raised a little over $100, but we are still under market value for our 3bdrm 2 bath home. We opted to sign a 2 year lease,  fully knowing our rent will raise again slightly halfway through the lease. We have had a couple issues, but they were taken care of, and I received phone calls from our portfolio manager and the person who handles the contractors to make sure things were taken care of. We do pay water, sewer, and garbage ourselves,  and my only complaint is that they bill 2 or 3 months behind. But thankfully I know that so I know to expect that when we move out. In 2018 lol. The condition of the house amazed me when we moved in. We were very pleased with it, and still are. Invitation Homes has been great for us, and it saddens me to see that it hasn't been that way for everyone.</Review>< username>

Absolutely do not rent from these people that I believe are frauds. They went back on an agreement we had when I had a personal difficulty. They said I could catch up on payments then gave me an eviction notice, snuck payments and charges in that they don't tell you about before you move in. Then there's the constant inspections along with the people they send to take pictures on a regular basis. I was always catching these photographers. When cornered, all they would say is they are getting paid to do a job. This list goes on but just stay away from them at all costs.< /Text>

<name>Cassandra Morgan<//name><date>1425784816433</date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>The WORST property management to possibly rent from! Was a renter with Invitation homes for two years and it was the worst decision in 13 years of being a renter! First off, when I met with the lady showing the house I was very specific on how much I could afford a month. NOTHING was ever discussed when we were approved for the house about the garbage, water, and sewer being our responsibility until three months later when a bill from a third party arrived in the mail. I take responsibility for not looking closely at the contract but it added a little more than $100 to my rent a month that was not planned for. Secondly, when you go into the office off of Blue Oaks don't anticipate talking to anyone that matters. There is a receptionist who has no answers for you and when you ask to talk to your "portfolio manager" there is no one available and you cannot ever get a call back. Thirdly, the move out costs are a joke! They will nickel and dime you. Do not expect to get anything back. They will attempt to charge you for things that are not your responsibility as a renter. The inspector will do the walk through with you and make notes. He does not carry a copy of the original walk through and then after your walk through he has you sign it off and then he states he has a more "thorough" inspection to do by himself. Who knows what he adds to the paper after you leave because he does not give you a copy! Just got our itemized list back today. They charged us $60 for broken boards for missing fence boards to a already failing fence. Since when is it the renter's responsibility to replace a fence? Even so, it's two peoples fence. Plan on speaking to the neighbor about how long that fence has been leaning. I can bet money it's been longer than the two years we lived in the house. $30 to replace 6 (Supposedly) light bulbs, $5 to replace batteries in the smoke detector... really? Sounds like the landlords responsibility .... I may be wrong. $70 for blinds that are missing three slabs... when you can go to Home depot and get them for $20. The biggest problem is they charged $100 for touch up painting when my husband repainted everything! (He paints for a living guys). He also used the EXACT same color paint...how do I know??? Because the smart guys who painted it before we moved in (and did a TERRIBLE job) left the extra paint in our garage. So, what was needed to be painted since it was painted days before inspection?!? In regards to the garbage, sewer, and trash situation they too try to rip you off. I have been paying them every month (they tack it on to your rent every month) but for some reason my final bill is $345.47.... WHY??? I am highly upset and disappointed in this company. I would think twice before getting stuck into a contract with this company. We personally moved out because they decided to raise the rent over $100 after our two year lease was up and it was just too much for that house. I hope this has helped anyone from making the mistake that we did. Or at least you'll go in there with better knowledge of what you may come across.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

If I could give this property owner a 0 I would. I will never rent with this company again because they don't care. My property manager is never available and I have been without elecrucify in my kitchen and living room all weekend and when I call to see why the tech didn't come today they just said oh no one was ever scheduled a tech and now no one can come for another week! Piece of *! $@ company.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give zero stars I would if it's not one thing with this company it's another we finally received our utility bill that we should have received 2 months ago my wife called waypoint homes in Sacramento and they told her corporate messed up how is this acceptable  I know if we were late on a bill they would late charge the hell out of us all honesty you are better buying a house and if you want to move either rent or sell it. My wife and I read the reviews about the company before moving in to this house we rent from them and they were all negative but being we have a pit bull it was hard finding a home that would accept the breed and we didn't think it would be this bad but we were wrong so if you are looking for a house to rent avoid waypoint homes.< /Review>< Pics>

The worst property management company ever. I am a new Tennant in sacramento. Before I moved in on 6/23, before I signed my lease and paid my money they were very responsive. Since then, I can't get a live person in the Sacramento office to respond to my calls or emails. I have put in several work orders for mold, plumbing, and other things that were not fixed when I moved in and they keep giving me the run around..their technician was suppose to come out last friday, I sat here all day waiting. Only to learn that he said he was here and closed out the work order ! But he NEVER KNOCKED ON MY DOOR! They don't want to do their jobs, I can't even complete my unpacking because there are so many things  (such as mold removal in cabinets,broken toilets, no closet bars to hang clothes) broken/undone. Everyone I get the call center they try to schedule me for yet another week out and say someone will call..it never happens. I feel like it's time to consult and attorney,  I can't even live comfortably and enjoy my home! This is ridiculous!  I pay over 1700$ for a home where I can't even use the washing machine because the plumbing is so backed up.<//text>

I am a home owner behind an Invitation Homes property. This mgmt company is terrible. Very slow to foster a collaborative relationship. We have a shared fence that needs replacement. They chose to slap a bandaid instead of fixing it properly. Stay away from this company. They suck.<//Text>

Look elsewhere!!! This is a company that does not care. About you or their homes. They care about the money. That's it!

We have been renting from them for a year and eight months but don't think we'll make it to the end of our lease.

Because:
-we were told that's the house has AC. It doesn't. And in California summers, the house is a sauna in the summer. Sleeping at night is impossible!
- the carpet is DISGUSTING! When we asked what can be done, they thought I'd be a wonderful idea if we could replace it. Not happening.
- there is a crack in the ceiling that we have told them about. The roof could cave in at anytime. Being from a family with a construction background, that could be moldy water.
-the heating system is so out of date, it doesn't work. So right now in the winter, we are walking around in coats in the house. It's the same tempurature inside and out of the house . Plus the little heat it does produce (sometimes) doesn't even flow to the rooms. So we are freezing.
- there are squirrels in the attic
- we have had a mice problem for over a month, three calls to maintenance and doing everything we can and they are still running around and scratching in our walls. Disgusting!

There are many other problems with the house we are renting as well but maintenance doesn't fix the problem. They just adjust it.

When we called about ending our lease early, that was fine by them too because instead of fixing up their houses and making them livable, they would rather take our money and rent out the home to the next unsuspecting customer.

Please don't rent from IH.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>I agree with all of the utility bill issues. Before this company switched over to waypointe, I received A copy of the utility bills before they were due.  Now Ive been receiving No copy and I have no way of knowing that its the actual bill.  I started with Colony American Homes and didnt have any problems for the first year. Once they switched to Waypoint, Ive had nothing but issues from my rent going from 1250 monthly to 1465 in 3 years and that doesnt include the monthly service fee,water,sewage,and garbage bill.  I don't recommend renting from this company.  Its not worth the stress!!!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

HORRIBLE NO STARS

Greetings,

I just moved out of one of their homes in California. I received false charges from the PM of utilities bill and carpet cleaning. I pay my utilities in full with my rent every month which has never been late I received a bill from the PM stating I owe $456.78 How is that when I moved out Jan 5, 2016 my bill usually around $145 where do 456.78 coming from.  Secondly I being charge $525 for carpet cleaning when I has the entire home professionally cleaned. They called in there on carpet people and said they used a black light and found 3 spot of urine spot so they had to treat it for two days, prior to me move in inspection they DID NOT USE A BLACK LIGHT. Everyone who knows me my 1 child who’s eight and I who resided in the home is scared to death of all animals, pets etc. besides that she is Asthmatic on a Nebulizer machine and have Anxiety. I gave the move out inspector a copy of the cleaning bill they didn't not honor it.  The contract only stated you must have your carpet professionally cleaned which I did. I did a pre move out inspection the guy was so amaze how I kept my home so clean and stated it looks like know one lived here, I a very clean person slight touch of OCD I've owned homes had a rental property before and rented homes and NEVER had a problem with getting all my deposit back.  I tell all my family and friends do not ever rent from them.< /Review>

This company is the WORST! Not only do they make it incredibly hard to pay rent if you are using two different accounts, but just today when I went to pay a portion with a money order at the office (I'd emailed ahead of time making sure I could do this), I walked to the door, which I found to be locked. It was 3:45 pm on a Tuesday, there was a person (which I later found out to be the area manager) sitting at the desk closest to the door. She saw me try to open the door, then TURNED HER BACK TO ME! She was talking on the phone, and wouldn't even look at me. I called the number listed for Waypoint online just to confirm this particular offices hours for the day. Open 8- 5 I was told. As stated earlier, it was well before that when I arrived. The woman I was speaking to on the phone tried to call numerous people to get ahold of someone to see why the office was locked and the person (area manager) sitting inside on her cell phone was not answering the door, or even looking at me at all! I knocked on the door, she turns around and tells me "I'm not going to open the door!" I tell her (through the closed and locked door) I'm on the phone with waypoint right now and she tells me something I cannot make out. Clearly making it known she would not help me. I spend 16 minutes on the phone with a very helpful woman who could not help me any further. I thanked her for her time and waited, as I was told there would be another person returning from lunch soon. (Lunch an hour before closing time? Sounded off to me, but I didn't think too much into it.) I just wanted to pay MONEY to them and be on with me day. Finally, after another 10 minutes of me standing in front of the door, she  (area manager) gets a key and opens the door to let me in. I figured she was done with her phone call and can now help a paying customer. She instead tells me, "she is not the office manager and cannot help me with any questions." I told her that was fine as I was there to just pay rent. As I'm filling out my money order she is still on the phone with another waypoint associate (the associate I'd emailed earlier) . After I give her the money order she asks if that is all. I requested a receipt for the money I paid. I had to let her know how to make a copy of the money order and sign the copy for me as a receipt. I let her know she acted VERY unprofessional. I am so glad to be moving out, and away, from this company. If you value your time or want fair treatment STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!< /review>

<Text>Everything negative being said on here is true this company is absolutely horrible. I rented with them for 2 years and had nothing but constant maintenance and pest issues from cockroaches to termite infestation inside our home. They severly overcharge for utilities and will not show you an invoice from the utility company which makes me think they are adding some on the top for profit. And WAYPOINT save your breath don't respond to me I'm just here to warn people of the CROOKS you are. BEWARE DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SHADY COMPANY!!!< /Text>< username>

Absolute Sh*** avoid them like a hooker with aids.  They will bend you over and ask for more after.  Jessy Nannof (property manager) is sweet to start but changes into satan if you have any kind of problem.  Our rent was $1650 but on the move out was $1900 they were trying to charge for..... On top of it, I moved voluntarily but on my move out papers they labeled evicted; Plus they tack on little things, such as light bulbs; $60 for light bulbs that had never been touched since i moved in. This company is an absolute POS, do not ever rent from them.  Even better, they create a monopoly in the rental market by buying multiple properties in the same neighborhood and then raising the rent without a reason other than, it's our own system, which is based on their properties, not MLS or current market rates but their own system of valuation of which, they will not tell you how they come about their rates.  I was labeled as a Marijuana grower because I built a room in the garage and pulled 220v from the panel...... I weld for the company i work for and required that for my living, did not feel that was necessary.  Point being..DO NOT RENT FROM THESE MONEY HUNGRY, POS, mother f****<//text>

<Text>I won't ever recommend to rent from invitation homes no matter what they will take your deposit!! And they are so unorganized they will start billing you for utility charges from the past. It's too bad I have to give them one star because they don't deserve it. I incourage people that rent from them to report any issues to the BBB so they file an
investigation!<//Text><Date>1489950051558< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<text>Invitation Homes is a joke. They are a company that only cares about money. If you go to this property management they will take your money and lie to your face stating the house is in a great living condition. Is mold inside walls a "great living condition". Is it ok for a child to be taken to the emergency due to mold being inside the walls of the rental property? I don't think so. Not once did they even bothered to show up and look at the problem. A big corporation that states on their website " Invitation Homes’ rental homes are thoroughly renovated with quality and care. Before you move in each rental home passes through our rigorous 250-point quality assurance program. Along with professional management and customer service, this gives you the peace of mind you deserve." and once a serious and hazardous problem is known to the company. They turn their backs and make tenants live in such living condition. Disgusting and appalling!!! Please stay away from this company. For your sake and the sake your children. Don't forget if you do go to this property management ask to change the locks prior to moving in they do not do that. There have been tenants that have been burgularized to locks not being changed. And for false advertising their homes using old pictures. I'd give this company zero stars but that is Not an option to bad because they don't deserve one. Further more if you think that Mr.Butterworth and Nessa G' s is a truthful review that you must be insane. No other tenant that put reviews for this company types IH for Invitation homes. It's not ridiculous to think it's a member of the company to try save their review ranking. Ha! Just sad.< /text>< pics>

<UserId.>116679026672711390346< /UserId.><Rating>1</Rating><review>Worst property management company I have ever rented from.  They were like used car sales people.  Telling us everything we wanted to hear in the beginning.  Then when it came time to request maintenance the issue was not resolved.  A plumber showed up and fixed one (leaking kitchen sink) issue and said he fixed the other issue. (leaky toilet) Two days later a second plumber showed up without any knowledge that the first plumber had already been on site.  We were told we would get HVAC air filters as part of the move in and those were not there.  It took 2 weeks before a different maintenance man showed up with those.  I gave up on their maintenance department, and never once did I get a call from my PM asking how it went, were the issues fixed.  Then at the end of our first lease they raised the rent.  My PM stated it was policy to raise the rent at the end of every lease regardless of market conditions.  I then moved due to military service and was charged a prorated amount for the amount of days I stayed into my last month there and it was fair.  However I was informed that even with the military clause I had to pay up to the remainder of the rent for the month or until someone moved in.  Not sure that is a fair business practice.  Needless to say they took the rest of my deposit, I moved out on the 6th of May.  Finally they nickel and dimed me for "repairs" 5.00 a light bulb, 6.00 a light bulb, 25.00 per slat missing on the blinds, 5.00 to unclog 4 drains that were not clogged when we moved out.  442.65 for a final clean after I used one of IH's recommended cleaning companies to do a final clean for 600.00.  Do not use this company to rent a home.< /review></record></dataset><record>

We've been tenants for coming up on 3 years now.  This review may sound like an insider review, but it isn't.  Over the course of 3 years, IH has been exceptionally responsive to any maintenance or repair that was needed on our property, including items that could easily be defined as "cosmetic".  The staff in Roseville is always polite, will always work around your schedule, and I just can't say enough about them.

There are many horror stories about Property Management companies, most of which deal with them trying to scrimp every penny of profit out of their tenants while not caring about the conditions of their property.  My experience with IH could best be summed up with a philosophy that IH views the rentals as an investment, rather than an income source.  From the staff to their subcontractors, everyone has been very pleasant to work with.  I can't say enough about them.  Pay your rent on time, don't trash the place, and I'm sure they will be glad to work with you.<//review>

<Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Review>So far so good. I am a new renter with IH and one thing that stands out the most to me is the fact that when you apply for a home it is immediately removed from their website. Honestly in the past that is the worst feeling not knowing if someone else is apply or if there is some degree of  discrimination. With IH I didn't feel that way at all. One thing I do think they could do a little better is disclose more clearly on the website before applying are some of the extra fees you pay such as pet rent ect. Other then that I have had a great experience so far. There had been a few issues when moving in with the home but IH had someone at my house within a day to fix the issues. I am in love with the home and it is beautiful inside and out.< /Review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Time>

We recently had to move and did not find another home with invitation homes. I am very disappointed to say rhe least. I cleaned the house. We moved out of to look better than when we movwd in. We did not get most of our depost back. Rhey charged us from everything feom cleaning the w alls which were alreadu cleaned to cleaning rhe carpet which I had cleaned three times myself. They just ripped us off and had I known I would not get my deposit back I would have just moved and let the clean up. They are a bad company to. .<//text>

My hubby and I have been renting from IH for the last 3 yrs and have NEVER once run into any problems. in fact, since Nov 2015, my family has suffered a series of major deaths that has had us traveling to and from Indiana 4 times within a 4 month period. Never once did IH hesitate to allow us to pay "late" so that we had monies needed to go. All we had to do was BE HONEST with them and they took care of US!!  late fees included of course, but we got to go home and were able to bring the kids along!  My family will always be grateful to IH for that. now we have to move and sadly IH isnt where we're going to be. THANK YOU IH for everything!!! - MVG< /text>< date>

<Review>Less than one star!!!  Let me just say - I am not a resident.  It is for a friend, but I was a frequent visitor.   At first this place looked very nice!  But looks can be deceiving! I was appalled to find out when the outside sewers leaked and filled her house floors with sewage.  Of course what was above ground my friend cleaned up, but who knows what lurks below?  Ugggh!  Roaches were never eradicated.  They only sprayed and did not address the owner who shares a common garage wall.  Ick.  The roof leaked and the did not fix it properly.  It leaked again and warped the floor.  There was also black mold that someone else mentioned.  Some kitchen repairs needed that they never took care of.  Just be warned and know your tenants rights!</Review>< Time>

Horrible workers ESPECIALLY for plumbing and customer service, they give you an attitude when you call because they haven't given an update on any work orders, I've been living here for 6 years and still can't send a work order through their own website and have to call, it takes them an outrageous amount of time to fix anything, or they'll send someone Unqualified out to your house like they just recently did yesterday 02/21/19, also don't try to call when it's around 4pm it's apparently too close to closing for them to do anything or even be able to pick up the phones, and you can't contact them on the weekends for anything like rent, services, or maintenance.< /Review>

Federico Alvarez made a maintenance stop regarding our dishwasher. He was very polite and respectful. He explained the issue to me thoroughly and fixed part of the issue. Unfortunately, I think there may be a bigger issue with the dry heat feature so I will need to submit another maintenance request. But Federico mentioned this to me ahead of time.</Text>

Federico A. came to my house today for repairs.  He was on time and courteous.  He made all the repairs super fast that he was able to make and ordered a part for the microwave door for a later repair.  I really appreciate how much he cared about his work.  He was very professional, polite and did things right.
