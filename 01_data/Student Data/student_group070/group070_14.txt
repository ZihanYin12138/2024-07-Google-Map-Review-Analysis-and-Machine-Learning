<review>Yet another excellent, independent, local find thanks to Yelp!

This is a kiosk in a quiet Danville strip mall that serves super high-quality coffee. I opted for a hot Turkish coffee to go and it was as intensely bold and rich as I'd expected - and then some. A gentleman who I'm guessing is the husband of the owner was also super explanatory about the coffee and gave me a few sweets to help wash it down.

Look closely and you'll also see Russian and other European sweets and treats for sale along their left side wall. Can't wait to come back and try more of their offerings!</review>< Rate>

Great place. Superb mocha. Love it how they ask for the sweetness level. I usually don't order mochas but they make the best mocha I've ever had. They were so nice and pleasant which I greatly appreciate. Thank you! It's hard for me to eat in the morning so I finally got around to eat the cranberry scone. It is really good, what a scone should be in my opinion.< /Text>

<Review>Not only is this the best coffee I've had in my life, but the owners are truly the sweetest people you could ever ask to have running a coffee shop! They are working on the deck plates with their employees--hard work, dedication, and true passion poor into their business on a daily basis, yet they are always there to greet their costumers with a "smile" or "hello" every day. Igor and Ina are the best and two of the hardest working people I know! You can tell there is true vision behind what they're doing, to provide exceptional coffee to the community. You will not find better coffee in Danville or San Francisco!< /Review><gmapID>0x808f8cacf5ef6cc5:0xea8c5eb3b1856ac6<//gmapID>< Rate>

Tucked in a corner. Across from Burger King in Danville. Nice family owned and ran business. The take away is no indoor seating to enjoy the great drinks. Good selection of snacks. Several different coffee selections available. The will grind you purchase to order, say for a paper or metal filter.</review>

Good selection of coffee and snacks. Only seating is outside, that's a downer. Nice family owned business.
Great for coffee on the go or on a nice day. Location is good, just tucked in a corner where you might miss it.</Review>

< Review>
After searching across the state and internet for shops/delivery services to buy my beans, this place has absolutely met or exceeded all of my expectations.

As someone that prefers the bright acidity and fruitiness of East African coffees I was thrilled to see three Ethiopians (Harrar, Sidamo, and Yirgacheffe) plus a Kenyan AA ranging from $16-21/lb (compared to the $18-24/12oz that many third wave roasters charge for similar offerings) that had all been roasted within the previous week.

The owners were clearly very knowledgeable about their product and were happy to offer tastes and samples based on my preferred brewing method to help inform my future purchases of which I'm sure there will be many.

If you live in the East Bay and care at all about what your coffee tastes like, you owe it to yourself to check out Medleno because of the impeccable quality, value, service, freshness, and variety that they offer.</Review>

Cool little coffee shop (yes, little is accurate). Delicious drinks. Offered sweetener for the chai (warned it was strong), but to me it was perfect and I didn't even feel the need (I usually like things sweet, though)< /text>

When I had visited their website I had expected to visit a coffee shop/coffee roaster. Instead it is just a very small coffee shop with no tables outside. All the coffee is already bagged and the pricing was not that great. I went out my way to go to the shop and was disappointed in the experience. The coffee itself was okay but I had better coffee around town.<//review>

<Review>Tasty fried seafood, classic sides, plus desserts from a local bakery.  I had the catfish nuggets, macaroni salad, and a mini sweet potato pie.  I was pleasantly surprised by their dessert selection: they had a half-dozen types of cake plus sweet potato pies.  You get big portions for a reasonable price.  Friendly service.  Decor and seating are minimal, so this might be best as take-out.  (Note that they no longer serve burritos but still have signage advertising burritos.)< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy1w4d6C2i7Mv09Yv4k061f0k19t-cpW8bVms=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f80aa8e8741af:0xe4793e79f0d1d2c1<//gmapID></record>

For the price I paid the food wasn't up to par. The woman who served me was kind at first but didn't handle my food with care. But this sandwich though, super thin pieces of fish, might as well just gave me fish skins instead 😒<//review>

We ordered the snapper and shrimp combo. It comes with one side. We also got an additional of onion rings. Everything was super good! The fish is well seasoned. The staff is super nice as well. We got our order within 10 min.<//review>

Went here for my birthday and it was amazing! My birthday is in January, so it was a little cold but I sat at a window seat and looked out on the harbor. Pricing was pretty good and the service was excellent. The food was what you would expect, so overall very good.< /text>

Came here when I was getting my car fixed down the street. The food here was really good and the server was excellent. I didn't feel rushed to get in and out and appreciate that because I had to wait a few hours for my car to get done.< /review>

<Review>I love this place! The catfish is my favorite - but everything is good and the service is awesome. I used to go here every chance I got until I got a job too far away. Now searching for some place that matches their quality... haven't found one yet!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Haven't been here in a while. Was in Oakland for a doctor's appt and felt a hankering for some Catfish. Went to Louisiana Fish & Chips as I used to eat here all the time when I worked in Oakland.

Got the Regular Catfish platter with a side of Cole slaw. The regular platter is plenty enough. You get 4 big pieces of catfish. Got my fill on and went to the doctor's appointment.

Love this place. Glad they are still in business! Been coming here since early 2000's<//text>< pictures>

It's a small place, not much room to sit down and eat, it's mostly take out. But oh boy....the fish is BIG on flavor! And the portions are big too. The customer service is always great, ( yes I have been there quite a few times) and it has always been a pleasant experience.< /Text>

<Review>Ordered catfish and gumbo. First, I know catfish. I wasn’t given catfish! This establishment is giving people cheap, antibiotic infused Asian Swai fish and passing it off as catfish! Very deceptive! I also had gumbo. Instead of enjoying a nice bowl of soup with a spoon and staying clean, this gumbo had bone-in chicken, and shell crab that wasn’t even scored for easy opening! It was the most impractical and messy bowl of gumbo that I’ve ever had! My hands were a mess! I got roux on my clothes that popped from trying to open the hard crab shell! I did not expect a crab boil experience but I got one and I wasn’t happy about it! Also, they were very stingy with the amount of rice they gave with the gumbo (served in a little separate container) and rice is super cheap! $34 for a meal I didn’t enjoy! I won’t be coming back here!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Food is good, the young man that was serving at the counter although nice enough, almost give me the wrong order even though the was only myself and one other person in the restaurant at the time.  But good catfish.  Peach cobbler a little runny.< /review>

This place was so nasty. I went there because i read the reviews to only find out it was not pleasant. The fries were real soggy and the fish was overcooked and had no seasoning at all. i was very disappointed in this  place.< /review>

Man o man!!! If you LOVE SEAFOOD, this is the place for you!!! It is predominantly take out, but they have a couple tables. OK, THE BIGGEST FRIED OYSTERS I HAVE EVER SEEN!! Everything is fried in this great old fashioned fine corn meal mixture and the COLESLAW IS FREAKING DELISH!!! The combos are the best way to go...BUT, it is enough food for two people!! The young lady behind the counter is smart and quick to help you make sure you get your food hot and just the way you ordered it. If I lived in Oakland, I would be in here every week!!!< /text>

It allowed me to talk to the people inside as well as the server whom was very attentive and attractive. Needless to say the only thing my eyes wanted to see more tham her was my Gumbo I ordered. Now the Gumbo's Rue was not as grand as my Grandmother's (no one's is) yet the server's Grandmother's gumbo had it piping hot and tangy quite like tge cajun style it is. Tge crab were large and fully cookes to perfection, the sausage could be bigger yet the shrimp waa on point. All and all Great experience. I will be back!</review>< Pics>

I frequented this business at one time once a week but the poor customer service as well as the cheapness they show in providing condiments has me never returning after today. this brings me to reason of this post.  My order for today was very simple..Two too item combos (Prawns & oyster) & (Prawns & Sole) and a large Sole dinner. I was asked if I wanted bread included in the said dinner..I said yes..I was told 20 min it would ready. Upon my arrival 35 mins later my food was not prepared. I was asked to pay for the food which I did and then waited for an additional 15 min.  Th meals were poorly prepared as well as the portion were abnormally small. In addition because i was on lunch i didn't get a chance to look at the food. When my co-workers and I were able to eat the food we found only bread in one meal and even sadder two ketchup packages one tartar sauce for each meal and one tea spoon full of hot sauce in a container.... smh...The food is very pricey and the taste has never been above a 5 but its locations is ideal to my employer.  The Wonder bread they use cost a dollar a loaf. I was disappointed for the final time and will not be return...$74.18 for three meals and i got it to go and did get freak'n bread. Be advise< /Text>

It pains me to give a review that isn't 5 stars. If you look through my profile you can see that I am generally generous and lenient with my ratings, but I simply cannot in good conscience recommend this salon, and I will explain why.

Simply put, for the price, the quality just is not there. I was a walk-in, so I had to wait, which is to be expected. However, my nail tech left me so that my acrylic could "dry" (and those of you who get your nails done regularly know that acrylic dries very quickly, waiting is not necessary) just so that she could take care of another walk-in who wanted a wax. I get it, they saw money signs, but come on.

Attached are photos of the final outcome of my nails. You read that correctly, the photos are of the *final* outcome, yep, no, not halfway through, FINAL. And if you have any standards at all, you know this isn't good work. I'm sorry, but it just isn't. Honestly, it's a little embarrassing. View them from above and they look... okay, but view them from literally any other angle and they're just not great at all.

Not pictured: really goopy, lumpy topcoat on one nail because it got bumped and the nail tech haphazardly brushed it on, and a white smudge on my thumb nail after the nail tech did the french tip and didn't wait for it to dry before sealing with top coat. They also made my cuticles bleed from cutting them with their tools. I felt rushed, no time was taken at all. Clearly, they care about quantity more than quality.

I do want to take a second to note that my pedicure was a very different story, and I am happy with that result, at the very least. But I will still not return, because I am not in the business of gambling. IMO, coming to this salon is like a game of Russian roulette, maybe you'll get something good? But you might also not. I wouldn't risk it. Go somewhere you know will always take the time and give you your moneys worth.< /review>

I came here for the first time yesterday, and I paid $45 for a pedicure! And she cut the whole side of my nail ( my toe nail) all the way from the top to the bottom! Now my toe nail isn’t the same!

Very bad service with a young lady Kim she was very rude. Waist of money with the service & the work more her attitude! If you don’t ask how much a pedicure & manicure is they charge what they want! I don’t recommenced this place!!!</review>

<name>Jay F. Nelson<//name><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I own a housecleaning service, love camping and gardening, and regularly torture and kill XL t-shirts. At Salvation Army I can buy fancy name brands and fashionable golf accouterments for just a few bucks a pop. For the price of a single overpriced brand with a collar I can fill a drawer with quality manwear that you don't have to worry about keeping pretty. I buy 'em by the stack, enjoy the occasional compliment, and purchase a fresh bunch when my supply looks tired. The pandemic has really informed my spending choices. I now focus on supporting local businesses, especially San Diego breweries.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

<review>Employees have the best personalities. Very helpful and kind, and it is a medium sized store with a fairly large selection. Only one dressing room, so see if you can't try things on over your clothes. The furniture seems nice and I believe every day, they have a certain color tag 50% off. Idk about parking, as I usually get luck and park in front of the store, but other times, I park on the side of the bank and walk a half block or whatever it is, just to avoid the hassle. Lots of hidden gems here<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

We usually get great deals and spend lots and donate lots... Today I went in to the store to get "half off entire purchase". Only exclusion was printed "mattresses". I am standing in line to checking out and the checker was giving the lady in front of me this speak..."I can't give you half off the glasses because they are holidays items and this item is new so..." Get the picture? I said to him, "your coupon says 50 percentage of the entire purchase with only mattresses excluded."  The clerk then tried to point out that the sign says.... Whatever I have a coupon that says nothing about the"sign".   "I am sorry that's what management said. He shrugged. The lady was considering what to put back as the "policy" changed at the register. I said "If you are not giving her half off her entire purchase, this coupon is not valid."  Still no resolution. Without another word I walked out thinking about the bait and switch. Maybe management will be educated by post. This is false advertising and will not keep your customers coming in or donating at the Salvation Army.</Review>

<text>I enjoy shopping here! They have almost everything you need! The staff are wonderful 😊 The sales are out of this world. I buy a lot of name brand clothing and shoes here. I always check on the web , if I am not familiar with the brands. I bought a name brand purse here worth $400 dollars and I bought it for $16! I spend at least 3hrs here at times😊 So, go and check it out. Happy shopping to you😊🍷<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80d956ee9ef1eeaf:0xf8365bc9b0dbb969</Gmap_id></record>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>This store used to email out a calendar with their daily deals on it so that you could plan out your visits, but they stopped a few years ago. Now you have to call or drive by to find out what deal they are offering. They also recently stopped offering discounts higher than 50% off specific tags. There were a few times last year when they would mark all clothing for $2 a piece, but then they got a new store manager. Unfortunately, their pricing is too high in my opinion for lower end second hand items ($10 for a Forever21 dress with a tear? No thanks). Plenty of their goods are broken, stained, missing pieces, or just plain unwearable/unusable. If you're going to sell low quality used items, please make sure the price reflects that.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I have always supported the Salvation Army because I believe they really do help people and do good in the community.  I can't say anything good about this particular location though.  I know one important contribution to the community that they are involved in is allowing people to complete community service in lieu of jailtime there and they also hire a lot of people who are otherwise unemployable because of anger issues or insanity.  Although I support this, it is always disturbing when you have to encounter these slightly crazy "employees".  After cleaning out our garage, we had about a truck bed full of donations but when we got there, they guy said his truck was full for the day and to come back the next day.  We came back the next day with the same truck still full and the guy there started screaming and yelling at us stating that we dumped an old mattress there the night before.  He said he just knew we did it and said that he wouldn't take anything from us because we illegally dumped something there.  We calmly tried to explain that we were not getting rid of a mattress and tried to assure him that our same mattress was on ur bed at home.  He went into a rage and said we couldn't donate anything because he was sure we dumped a mattress there even though there was no proof.  We think he must have stopped taking his meds because his rage and accusations were outlandish and unreasonable for the given situation.  Another guy finally came out and we were able to donate our items, but they wouldn't give us any receipt for the donations because of the raving maniac they had to deal with.  Good luck to the Salvation Army but we will be finding a safer place to donate our items from now on.<//review>

<text>I thought the prices were high for being a thrift store. For example a coffee cup was $1.89. I also saw a sleeveless dress for $16.99 which had a ring around the collar and some snags. I can go on but I'll stop here.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This store is a complete joke! They price things from online without even testing them making things they sell here expensive and unreliable. Luckily I tested a stereo before I bought it and half the features didnt even work. EXPENSIVE-I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BOYCOTT THRIFT STORES WHEN THEY DO THAT KIND OF BUSINESS. ITS NOT A THRIFT DEAL IF ITS WAY OVERPRICED!!!!. I saw a table in there for $1000. seriously? And average bike prices are $150.....< /Text>

Store is too dark + worst attitude staffs resulting = constantly thought that customers there are for stealing instead buying or both. Many items are unorganized,covered with dust,black fingerpaints, yet stocker just put on the shelf just like throwing garbage.
Good to know that this store has been under new management after closed several months. Improve your service, the item’s displays and store needs lights more than before. For first timer, this store is located next to Bank of America.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<text>I can't say enough good things about Left Hand Black. Matt was lovely to work with. When I had questions, he answered them kindly so I could understand. I got exactly what I was hoping I would get and it was all short notice. Such a great shop, lovely people, and wonderful art work. Thank you!< /text>< Pics>

<text>My husband and I got our first tattoos yesterday with Matthew and we could not be happier. Everyone in the shop was super friendly and professional. Matthew was great and he clearly is an expert! We love our tattoos, Matthew is an exceptional artist. I would highly recommend Left Hand Black and Matthew to anyone interested!< /text>< user_name>

Artists of varying style, experience and attitude. When you choose Left Hand Black you gotta know you’re going to get a solid piece from a solid crew in an awesome setting. Turk is a skull and macabre master and he and his wife Crystal run a top notch shop.<//text>< Pics>

This is a great tattoo shop in Southpark San Diego. I stopped in last minute and worked with Matthew. I told him what I was thinking and he took some time to work up a design and did fabulous work for me. The place has fun decorating and all the guys were real fun to chat with as well.</Text>

Just look at the 5 star rating. The artists are very friendly. The shop is very clean and I like the whole grunge/heavy metal theme throughout the shop. Just moved out here to cali and was in the process of working on a cross cover up. I'm glad I stopped by. Ashley completed transformed this tattoo with his use of shading and color. Spot On and cant complain. Will definitely visit this shop in the future.</review>

Best place ever! This is the only place that we have ever had our ink done. The artwork on the walls is beautiful, one of a kind, and for sale! Turk was our artist before Ink Master. He's our favorite, though now in high demand. But that's ok because everyone in this shop are fantastic artists! I was just there, but I'm already thinking of my next tatoo.<//review>

Had an amazing new piece done by Jacob.  His sketch was on point and I would have been more than happy to have just the outline as a tattoo, and the final product was more than I could have ever hoped for.  These guys were friendly and funny, and I will definitely make them my go-to shop if I find myself in San Diego again, maybe even if I have to make it trip<//review>

It all started with the tattoo...

I got a tattoo at Left Hand Black by Turk. Really like what he did. Very fast which is good because he can get a lot of work done in a timely amount of pain. But I guess if it didn't hurt it wouldn't be worth it...

Then came the art shows. They have an art show going on right now that is all hand painted meat cleavers. How cool is that?!

Great place, people tattoos and art.<//review>

<resp>{'time': 1551829498555, 'text': "Hi Brody,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave us a review. While I'm a bit unhappy at the review that you left us, and find it a bit unfair since you have admittedly never visited our studio, I appreciate your opinion as an art lover. Left Hand Black strives to separate ourselves from other tattoo shops by our friendliness, cleanliness, and our dedication to the craft of tattooing. We also pride ourselves on our art-shows that house creative paintings, sculptures, and other oddities from artists all over the world. While we do our best to put into the industry as much as we take, we simply cannot make everyone happy. That's one of the best things about art, is that different art speaks to different people. Unfortunately, we weren't the studio for you and you decided to leave us a 1 star review as a result. I hope you find that 5 star shop and that you get the amazing work that you're looking for!\n\nAll the best!\n\nLHBLK"}<//resp>< gmapID>

While I never went in for a tattoo, one of Turk's staff helped me out with a few design tips as I was recommended by a friend of mine.  This place is really cool!  There's a fog of creativity that lurks within the walls of this place as folks from all over (not just San Diego) line up to tap into the spirits of the demiurgic tattoo artists.<//review>

Great shop to get some custom work. If you can think of it Turk can draw it and, more importantly, tattoo it. This guy is the tattoo getters tattoo artist. He knows how to make the experience a great one and walk out with some killer art. He know getting a tattoo is not the most comfy of experiences, so he gets some quality done in a timely manner.

I came to him with a concept and he came up with a few drawings. We hybrided 2 together went from there.  I even had him change a few things to get it perfect. He was more than willing to accommodate and make it truly a one of a kind piece of art on my canvas (me). Did the tattoo exactly as I wanted it.

Could not be happier!</Text>

It was a good price. The rooms  provided mini fridge, and microwave. That's why it got two stars.
Cons:  They closed the contiential breakfast 30 minutes early. There was no early check in. Pubic hair on the towels but room looked clean besides that. Kinda creepy people staying there. Asked for non smoking and still got put in a smoking with a baby. Asked us to check out early and knocked on the door four times, two times waking us up.< /text>

<review>Resounding "MEH" on so many fronts.

From the indifferent, borderline rude check-in experience, to the tired in-need-of-refurbishment rooms, and the "running out of everything" breakfast experience, this is not one of my favorite budget hotels.

Not recommended...< /review>< pics>

I would definitely say this hotel is under rated. The rooms were very clean and we'll appointed. The beds were comfy and the bathroom spacious. I was expecting much less for a 2.5 star hotel. Great price, would definitely recommend.< /review>

<resp>None<//resp><rate>4< /rate><Review>The rooms were nice and the breakfast was delicious. I enjoyed my stay until the women working the front office began to call my husband "dumb" saying "he should feel really dumb. Who would do something like that?" When he was conned out of his room key card by a drug addict and his girlfriend who took his key and then fled. These people really tricked him into believing they were good people who were having trouble with their own key. Which u need to get inside the building. I went to the front desk to get a new set of keys because according to the housekeeper, these con artists wait until you aren't in the room and go in and steal your stuff. So she told me to go get new set of keys. And then these young girls working the desk look at me like I'm stupid and insult me and my husband. Besides that it was a good stay overall. Just be careful who you interact with here</Review>< date>

<Text>Very mediocre. Pretty noisy all night long (road, water pipes, hospital next door, and lots of other sounds). The bed was acceptable but a bit scratchy and not very soft. Both sinks in the room were rusty. Breakfast was pretty minimal as well. It wasn't awful but certainly not fancy.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>Awful Experience. To start we were charged $30 more than the listed price online. The hotel stank of chemicals when we went into the main lobby and we almost passed out in the stairwell. Just gross. The toilet wouldn't flush in our room so I explained this to reception. He said he'd change the room for me and then told me to come down and get the new key cards. I work for a resort and if a guest isn't happy with their room or has a problem, you apologize and then bend over backwards to improve their experience. You don't tell them to come and fetch the replacement key cards, you run them up to the room and assist in moving the guest to their new digs while asking if there is anything else they need. Terrible experience. Avoid this place.<//Review>< gmapID>

It was a bit run down. Curtain was ripped and sink had a hole in it. We were in and out so it was not a big deal. Breakfast was good for a standard continental. Would stay at in a pinch, but not if I had other choices.< /Review>

<Review>Comfortable room, but mixed smoking and non-smoking rooms.  Hot tub was small with weak Jets, too far from the motel building and in a little awkward place with a large building next door overlooking the pool and hot tub area.  Breakfast was typical Econolodge with waffles but not eggs or bacon.</Review>< gmapID>

No wifi here. Confirmed at the desk. If that's important to you, you may want to look for another place. Also, cable signal is Standard Definition. Terrible picture in this very nice High Definition TV. Coffee was very  good. Breakfast very good. IHOP restaurant next door. Fantastic pool.</Text>

Historic means old, run down and dirty.  No elevator. I didn't  want to step in the shower worth my bare feet, and didn't want the shower curtain to touch me!  the shower is clogged up so my shower Bevan a bath,  very unpleasant.  I paid $184 a night after taxes to stay here.  That is waaaay too much for this "historic" dump. 👎</Text>

Stay Away. The manager lies. I had reserved a non-smoking room and was given a room that was obviously a smoking room. It was not marked as non-smoking (all the rooms on the other side of the hall had no smoking signs) and it had an ash tray with two books of matches in it. When I went back to the front desk, the clerk said that it was marked as a non-smoking room in their system and that the house keeper must have made a mistake with the ash tray. When I spoke with the manager in the morning, I got the same line about the room being marked as a non-smoking room in their system. That was complete nonsense.

One other thing, the sink in room 204 was so old that there was a 3 inch circle of rust spots coming through the porcelain.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We spent two nights at the Quality Inn & Suites in Santa Maria and enjoyed every minute.   We were not expecting any breakfast, continental or otherwise, but boy were we surprised.   Served from 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM, they have two waffle makers, sausages, every kind of pastry, cereal, coffee, orange juice, and milk.

Our room had a coffee maker, refrigerator, and microwave.  There was a separate sink outside the bathroom so I could brush my teeth while my wife was taking a shower.  There was even a balcony off the sliding glass door.   Very nice facilities for a reasonable price.

My only complaint is their free wifi service involves a proxy server.   I don't mind watching a commercial before getting connected, but on the second day I started getting proxy error messages and could not connect.   It would be nice if they had better wifi.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

WAIT A MINUTE! A friend got into a heated argument with his lady out in the parking lot.  After the yelling stopped he came in to my room.  That's when the POlice showed up.  He went away with them and I was not so politely asked to leave by some piece of work punk ass manager who seemed to get real personal special thrills when he tossed my ASS out.  Dudes lucky I didn't get upset or take it personally myself.  Screw this dive.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Never stay there.My fiance stayed there and said there was a baby mouse in the room.She said she tried contacting the manager for a refund but refused because the maid found potatoes there.I know a mouse from wherever isnt going to smell potatoes and in fact a baby,so you have to know there is a mommy mouse and a daddy somewhere else in the hotel.They treated her terrible and the manager needs to be dismissed and not treat the customers like nothing.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Simple but well structured hotel in a nice place in a small town. The rooms are spacious. The breakfast is very basic. The attendants are kind. Nearby are fast food restaurants. Ideal for overnight on the highway linking San Francisco with Los Angeles, it is very close to one of the highway exits. The wifi works well.

(Original)
Hotel simples, mas com boa estrutura em local agradável em uma cidade pequena. Os quartos são espaçosos. O café da manhã é muito básico. Os atendentes são gentis. Nas proximidades há restaurantes tipo fast-food. Ideal para pernoitar na rodovia que liga San Francisco à Los Angeles, fica bem perto de uma das saídas da rodovia. O wifi funciona bem.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Quality Inn is nowadays an economy lodge in Santa Maria California. Heavily outdated. Staff cannot and may not do anything. Manager does not appear. Booked for two days. Leave very early tomorrow morning. Water is switched off. We will be reimbursed for 1 dav. Furthermore, nothing can be arranged. So a quarter to 6 quickly to the toilet and away.

Dus om kwart voor 6 snel naar t toilet en wegwezen.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Front desk very friendly, therefore 2 stars - otherwise terrible. Old, neglected, stains and holes on the armchair, chair and bed - in need of renovation. Outer door to the outside (ground floor) wedged with an old wooden rod and thus secured against obviously frequent break-ins. Room (non-smoking) smells like cigarettes.

(Original)
Rezeption sehr freundlich, daher 2 Sterne - sonst fürchterlich. Alt, ungepflegt, Flecken und Löcher auf Sessel, Stuhl und Bett - renovierungsbedürftig. Außentür ins Freie (Erdgeschoss) mit einer alten Holzstange verkeilt und damit gegen offensichtlich häufige Aufbrüche gesichert. Zimmer (Nichtraucher) riecht nach Zigaretten.<//text>

< review>
I called the station when I was involved in a auto collision and i got hung up on. This is not the first time i have called the station.  Every time i have called someone extremely rude is at the other end of the line. Not to mention they will never come wen u need them. Every time its the same excuse.  They were busy on another call yet drive around the city all day long and count how many patrol units u will run into.  Chances is 00001.< /review>

My recent experience with this department was far from expected, My customer was victim in a massive  collision with 2 kids in her vehicle. Leaving everything behind, The police were called to help assess the situation and instead of just assisting, deputy Lew took the keys to my customers car when was asked multiple times to have them back the deputy refused to give it back to us and threatened to tow the vehicle to some other location when we clearly said that we will have our tow trucks pick it up. All we needed was my customers belongings and the kids backpack. After going back and forth (whole conversation was recorded on my phone) the deputy’s partner got involved and informed deputy that I was recording and then he finally changed his attitude<//Text>

Compelled to accord a 5 star here. Deputy Han and his colleagues were truly professional in their handling a sticky situation this evening. I am thankful  for these fine officers who are making efforts to bring equilibrium and take a neutral and just approach.</review>

The sheriff station in Norwalk always seems busy.  I see these hardworking men and women go up and down our streets every day.  I had a problem with my car being damaged while being parked a couple of streets from my home.  I called the Norwalk-La Mirada police department when I noticed the damage, and a police officer came to my home.  He helped me investigate what went on the previous night by going around and asking the community if they had witnessed anything.  I repaired the car and went back to my busy schedule.  I really like these hardworking people.  May god bless them, and I would love to see us all move Forward.</text>

Just saw a video from West Coast Digital that was doing a 1st amendment audit on some company in Norwalk and he was assaulted. He called the sheriff's department to file a report and press charges, AND he had the whole thing on video! The sheriff's that showed up was making a bunch of excuses and basically didn't want to file the report or allow him to press charges!! I don't always agree with what these guys do with these audits, but come on the guy was ducking assaulted man, how in the world do you make excuses when the guy has it all ON VIDEO!!!! Some things not right when their not doing what they were hired to do, protect and SERVE, how is that serving the community when you refuse to press charges on someone that assaulted someone. This is exactly what happens when these Scientologists call the cops on these guys that do these audits on them, they side with the suspect from this CULT called Scientology!!<//text>

I was there on Thursday July 9 at 5:45pm. And I waited for more than 50mnts. To get help, lobby was empty when I arrived then 2 people walked in and left after 15, then 2 guys came to, 1 follow sleep because the long wait. They need to be retrained and emphasized on them that they are here to serve .< /Text>

I don’t mind if you don’t do anything about it and have other stuff to do but please don’t harass tax payers for a favor. If there was any indication of an abuse of power these guys would be it. Now people go down my street 100-150 mph full throttle daily. I would not want to call in being afraid they might do something else.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I called because they stole a car right across the street from my house. They actually asked if I was sure that they were stealing the car. The operator was extremely rude and sounded like if she didn't want to listen to me. Change has to come.</Review>< Pics>

They are rude and talk down to everyone like they are ones who make the laws ... I went to get some answers and I left with a headache because they don't know how to talk without having a attitude... I understand their work is hard but they don't need to be rude and give one attitude when it's their job to help< /review>

Norwalk Sheriff's  department is a disgrace!! All they do is stay behind commercial building's to pass time and do nothing. Police are supposed to help the community and keep us safe. All they do is get paid for doing absolutely nothing. And when a complaint was made to the departmemt someone voices there opinion by saying "We do are best to help. But if you don't like what you see then you can leave and find a better neiborhood" now this is unfortunate.. quite unbelieveable to hear. And these are the people we look up to.. truth is you cannot trust anyone to help you not even the paid people to do so. It's a shame</Text>

<Review>Horrible they are a disgrace.  For covering up the lack of professionalism of their own kind.   I called the sherrifs because I was having issues with my daughter.  After a sheriff almost arrested my daughter and said that any time I had trouble with her to call and they will help. I had an argument with my daughter and she end up assaulting me.  Usually I just hold her down until she comes down.  But that time she ended up putting hands on me.  So I called them. A very condescending and immature cop dismissed me.   Saying that he wasn't going to raised my daughter.  I mention that she hit me and usually she destroys things around the house and had broken the doors.  He said that was her house and that she could break whatever she wanted.  So he said he wasn't going to do anything.  I ask him if he was going to check my daughter and me and he said there was no need.  2 days later they took my daughter and social workers came without a court order and search my house kidnapped my kids and made claims that my daughters had bruises and scratches.  When all she had was a busted lip.  I was arrested by that same lame and ignorant sherrif that came and fail to check on us on first place. I was 4 days in Lynwood jail sick and deprived of medicine and on top bleeding.  When I never been arrested in my life.    My daughter under custody of them and social services takes off and takes off in my car.  My mom call the cops to report my car stolen and they refused to write a report.  While Im in the hospital unaware of the situation and unaware of the fact I was being arrested because the idiot fail to read me my rights.  Because he was acting like a child laughing and flashing the lights on my face.  They broke into my house and search all my personal property and kidnapped my kids while my mom was here.   My previous experience with them was also horrible.  I just had moved in to where I live and I guess someone had call the cops saying someone had broken into the house.  They stormed in at gun point and put my 14 y/o son on the floor at gun point and my sick mom also.  My son was traumatized and my mom almost went into diabetic shock.   Now Im at the mercy of the corrupt CPS and so are my kids.  Where every kid is a meal ticket to maintain their pay.  Now my kids are suffering because they can't come home.  After they had said that I didn't hit them and now we are in the hell trap of CPS that's it's just as profitable as the jail system.   #thatschildabuse #cps #Norwalk #sheriffs #corrupt #disgrace</Review><username>Jasmin Lovett<//username><Pics>None<//Pics><date>1479632879805< /date></record></dataset><record>

They need some sensitivity training did not appreciate the way my situation was handled i was struck in my face and called 911 and the police officers that arrived bullied me into not filing a report they made me feel like i was a waste of time i would have been better off defending myself im just a normal person trying to live my life and there are people out there who are allowed to go around acting as they please and getting physical when things dont go there way its amazing and sad how things work here in Norwalk< /review>

<text>Over priced. Owner was rude and mean. He told a customer who was upset to come around to his side and he invited them to steal something​, even something just 1$, so he could call the cops and have his security guy tackle them.  The customer told security what's wrong with this man? No one said anything, the owner was having a bad day maybe and exerting control over customers. Bad vibes. I won't enter there again.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2b4ec75e11ff5:0x4a36a3daca34b67a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I been to a lots of truck store just Because my husband is a super truck lover. However, this is definitely my favorite place to go. These two gentlemen are always welcome and friendly. Very nice customer service and they are willing to help you as much as they can. Very good price also, trust me, we compare price all around in Sacramento, they will always give out the best price. Definitely will come back again and highly recommended this location! Also thank you for helping us with truck information!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP46vcVgYyHlDQ6lICh7K0m28xMVXWE7NtjjbQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlNPC_49e77syoCvR-aIjJng8s-LE8jMwjrrw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMtWFyous2FZtZbaL91Z5S5HoV_dUgoExZbLQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5ijiwUXIjBBZ00Lj4mLAnymDLLhzHWIwQtY8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSVc8mDoYksXKcffawTtgwr2A_rUtcpfOBo2w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN_86BhebYNfi1yWJeAS45duSZPcoxHo-nAFQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEiMhj2LDDSLgKLSCP230IHVclsiIUstr8-mg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqrThhGcm0OTli5MWmAtpENAuwNcq42uyagvg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqDe-Va6I6vTzAxKs-WT2V6wc1q-0BFkEd0PI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMF3hl5TNeZNgnNPygIZaoBIp6-9I9tdmyUTw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJOIATUfN3vALj-lDj2hRwBcQITp0ecxZ4cZY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj_EEweEq957gVF6klqBOUfe9y_f5TKFpodhg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl7arXBJGMmJSpJFFjX8Imz1WKw9opIT4WLwE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3cWaIigO0RhwaaaOTkVh_w9rfwdcPemuOT9s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm9WgZjLuI5V_SX9k-ubuQpaCtc8n6WQRYX08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk8NxzGtyvTDPqNvTLIFVJNZbPMb46EPWN3mw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7CSVcAPsF3twI1nDzBEVrNXKqYyhKhweIptQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIPwJAPEbIfDhC_rv7uIib7qUgLQKxMQs8LC0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwn3IIGZO198MtB6_Pi-jTXyHHDpPcYuTicTE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmzvY1kn90bcVygITQRc96qSY_FbJss8bVBPs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_Z8TUEv-dHdoFAQ0ZNsLvtKOnB5rOjOw_BFU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcuAJtm57OOLgAH9QnGZgG2tdFSktTi1Kv8f4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSlu1h1PP_x0BsdETXaP0tRELbLgzduV7m_gg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Jim was amazing to work with and they did a fantastic job!  The guy who installed the bed cover for my truck was honest and let us know there was a small dent on the inside of the bed cover.  Jim offered to put another on but I said it wasn’t necessary so he threw me in a hitch lock.  Awesome guys!< /review>< gmap_id>

Support this shop. Friendly people that go the extra mile in customer service. Even helped me with a truck bed extender install that they were not obligated to do.  Jim is a good guy. I will use this shop for all my truck accessories and you should too!</Text>

<review>Just bought my first truck at Enterprise. They referred me to One Stop to get my hitch installed. My appointment was for 9am. At 9am my truck was being worked on. It took approximately 45 minutes. As I waited I couldn't help but notice that the shop staff and mechanics were just a bunch of guys who loved trucks and understood that work can be fun. They were a team and their customer service was excellent. great experience!! I will definitely recommend my family and friends. I will be back for sure.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Had my 08 gmc Sierra Rhino lined there and it turned out great. Not only did it turn out great they had the lowest price in town and Jim working the front desk was a super nice guy. My first experience was a good one I will be returning for any of my future truck and 4x4 needs<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I just painted my 1997 Dodge Ram 3500 with a base coat clear coat and had One Stop Rhino line the bed and it was very affordable.   My concern was that the taping and heat from the product used may make my paint peel but the small spot that it did was in the bed so it was a great success.  The bed now looks brand new and prior to the rhino coating it was very ugly.  The owner there that looked at my truck took his time with me to understand exactly what I wanted and how I wanted the coating to look and where I wanted the edge lines to be.  He took great care of me and my truck.  I will definitely go back.  Great service, and great price, can't beat it.</review>< Pictures>

I went in looking for an adjustable ball mount and was pleasantly surprised by the great selection, friendly no-pressure help, and reasonable prices too. I got what I needed, and will definitely be back for future truck accessory needs.</Text>

I went in and ordered some running boards for my truck. After leaving the shop the day I had them installed I was little disappointed on the steps as they did not stick out far enough to get my foot on it. I called jim and he without hesitation said “ hoss bring them back we will get you something that makes you happy”
So they searched around for the steps and got them and and today I went in and they swapped them out with a smile on their face. The new steps look and work great very happy with them and also happy I’ve found my new go to shop.

<Text>Very pleased with the work done.  I needed a trailer brake controller for my Mercedes SUV.  Corey installed it for $100 less than the estimate.  Other RV trailer shops, that is Allied Trailer Supply and Camping World in the area afraid to do the job and refused to do the work.  Kudos to "One Stop Truck Shop."< /Text><user>116264360770521688269< /user></record></dataset><record>

Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious and affordable.  I came across this Mexican restaurant 6 months ago while working in Taft and I WILL NOT eat anywhere else while in this city.  Their 3 tacos , rice and beans for $5.99 is a deal. My favorite are their beef enchiladas.  The 2 gentlemen who work their whom I believe are brother's are very pleasant and welcoming. 5 Star A+ establishment in my opinion.</review>

The food here is amazing. I come in every week to get the California roll or California burrito. Each time the food tastes fresh and flavorful. Delivery is fast and reliable, and the staff is mostly friendly and welcoming.<//review>

Delicious, a friend of mine lives in Taft and we had a great lunch outsde, I had the mix fajitas and the flavor was the best i ever had in my life, .y wife is a chef and knows.
Howard had the Tuesday special of 3 taco of choice of meats with rice and beans. He though that could eat 1 or 2, but he cleaned the plate like i did, it was so delicious.
You have to go and see for yourself of how tasty it is, also the salsa they bring you with chips taste good, that means that they know how to prepare their menu. The owner is there and same location for many years.
I moved from Burbank to Bakersfield 14 months ago and my second time in Taft, I'll definitely wll return.</Text>

This is our favorite quick Mexican food. They literally have something for everyone including vegetarian meals. They are always very hospitable and always eager to please. The food is amazing and presented as such. The atmosphere is very take out, and the tables and chairs are nothing to gawk at, but the food will make you come back time after time.< /text>

Idk if I'm a big fan of their ceviche, we asked for a lil lime and they put like 13 limes in there, it was too sour, and for one I told them to not add onions and they did add it, so sorry it's a two stars probably not going to eat here again</Text>

<Text>Pretty good authentic Mexican food. I almost always get the al pastor California burrito, and it’s excellent. It’s a good size burrito, and you will leave full if you finish it. The house salsas are also tasty.</Text>< gmapID>

I have to say that this may be the best shshi place in town. I know that sounds strange because I normally come to Tacos Y Mariscos Casa for their Quesadilla Al Pastor, but their small sushi selection is so surprising. Today I had the California Roll and man, the seafood may have been the freshest I have had in a while. So yummy, also their guacamole is amazing.</review>

<Review>I used to be a regular, but the last two experiences have been terrible, I used to go often when they first opened and cared about the food they where serving. The owner use to make great food, but I think he lost his passion or something. There is a younger cook that has great food, but I've had the owner cook for me the the last two times and it was horrible. About six months ago I went in for a grilled chicken burrito and the chicken was burnt to a crisp and the burrito  was just horrible I came back the following week and ordered another burrito and the younger cook was there he made a great burrito and so I came up to the counter gave a tip and complimented the Chief and told the girl working the counter about the previous experience and she said the owner must have been cooking, the staff new of the problem about the owners cooking. I came back the following week and the owner was cooking so I figured maybe he had an off day and gave him the benefit of doubt. I received the same nasty burrito, I couldn't even stomach eating more than four bites, so I started going to la salsa as they have good food and don't burn the meat to a crisp. Six months later I decided to try again.  Just last week I ordered 4 tacos. The chicken and carne asada meat in my tacos was once again burnt to a crisp. I hope the owner reads this and just gets something out of it. When I go to work I take pride in everything that has my name on it, I hope you will in the future moving forward. As for me I won't be returning.</Review>< name>

The elevator is large and they have carts you can borrow to move boxes on.

Marion made our storage rental smooth and easy. We had to upgrade to a larger size at the last minute and she handed all the details for us. We ended up working at the unit going through boxes. Marion was always cheerful and helpful. We would definitely use Extra Space Storage again.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely fantastic service and storage facility. I worked with both Liz and Marion - they were both top notch. I had some tricky move-in and move-out dates, but they were able to help accommodate. They were always pleasant and responded to voicemails promptly. The facilities were clean and easily-accessible, as well. I couldn't recommend this place more highly!</Text>< UserId.>

Extra Space Storage saved us after our mother passed away unexpectedly.

We came a week before and reserved a storage unit to store some of Mom’s things in so she could move to Assisted Living. Although Covid restrictions were in place, Marion’s warm and friendly manner guided us through the rental.

Mom passed away a week later and my sister and a mover moved everything into the unit. My sister had to change to a larger unit and once again, Marion’s help was invaluable.

During our subsequent trips to the unit, we have found everything clean and Marion has helped us dispose of trash, and advise us any way that would help us. I would definitely come back here if I need a unit in the Monterey area again.

Helpful hints: Bi-Rite Market is just around the corner for amazing lunches when you are working all day. And the baseball park two blocks south is open during the day for restrooms. (None at facility for Covid).</Review>

Employees are very nice, sweet and understanding. The storages are pricey. I was very glad about it being gated. However I wish the hallways were bigger and the doors for the storage where bigger. I had a couch and had a hard time getting it in and getting it out when I left. Other then that. Great place.<//text>

They had the best price for the size of unit I needed among all the storage centers I checked. Taking possession of the unit was extremely simple and COVID-safe; everything was done online and I was able to put my own lock on the unit in completely contactless fashion. The unit itself (a 10x10) was very clean and easy to move into thanks to elevators, controlled gate access, and provided dollies. Highly recommend if you have any storage needs!<//text>

I’m a college student so home is 5hrs away for me. As some may know after every year when living on campus you have to pack everything up and move. Every time i pack up Extra Space is always there for me. Great customer service Marion even remembers me by name and face and that’s what makes me return. All the workers at Extra Space on Del Vina ave are absolutely wonderful and helpful! I’ve referred people here before and would do it again!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Awesome experience from start to finish!  Great selection, easy sign-up process with a few mouse clicks, and *no* hidden fees.

The facility is top notch, (clean, layout makes sense, units are in very good condition) operating hours are very flexible and convenient and we *love* the push carts that they provide for free.

Definitely a cut above the average storage facility!!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
My experience at Extra Space Storage in Monterey was really great! I had to move out of my apartment quickly and find a new place to live, but I couldn't take my whole apartment with me. So I drove over to Extra Space Storage in Monterey to rent a storage. I wasn't looking forward to all the paperwork  and the whole sign up process. I had too much on my mind !
Liz was like a breath of fresh air! She quickly identified my needs, and signed me up. It was a huge burden off my shoulders to know my property was in a safe place.
I moved the last of my property out today. I only had to rent a storage for a little over a month.
Marion and Liz are kind caring people, I appreciate that and all their help.</Review>

I have used multiple storage facilities over the years and this is the best one I have used to date - highly recommended for any military or non-military family that needs to store additional items.</Review>< Response>

As a military family, we recently found ourselves in a unique situation in Monterey area where housing is SCARCE. It was so stressful and when the need arose for storage, I found Extra Space. Marion and Liz made me not only feel at ease in the whole process of finding the right storage for my stuff, but they made me feel that I was not alone in all of this. They are beyond professional in a new realm of customer service that meets every need of the customer and makes them feel like a part of the community. When the day came that the huge moving truck pulled up outside and it turned out that I needed more storage space than I thought, they immediately helped me figure out exactly the space I'd need with the best possible price and again put me at ease. It gave me breathing room to figure things out and support moving forward with this messy, complicated military move. Thank you so much, Marion and Liz!  I highly recommend their services to all military needing storage and anyone else.< /Review>< user_name>

Extra Space Storage was very prompt and professional.  I signed up for a promotion online and received a call from Liz, who walked me through the contract and answered all my questions.  The facility is secure and clean, and priced competitively.  This is my second experience with Extra Space Storage and I'll gladly come back to them again!< /Text>

Outstanding assistance from manager Marion!
Before I even arrived, she texted a description of a space that met my dimension requirements, but she expressed her thought that it might NOT be the best choice. When I got there, she showed it to me, and I had to agree. The space I chose--with her assistance--is perfect. Easy, secure, well-lit access and a better deal than anywhere elsel locally around. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</review>

This has been the best storage rental experience that I have ever had. Not only are the facilities clean and well maintained, but also the staff is extremely sensible and respectful. My previous experiences with tobacco-scented offices, yappy chihuahuas, and unhappy managers pale in comparison to my current experience with Extra Space Storage. Would definitely recommend to friends and family in the area.< /text>

<review>I never thought I would need storage again and 7 yrs. later i need storage. Extra Space was the first place I thought of due to the great experience I had with them before. I have referred a number of people to the Monterey site. What makes them extra special besides their warm welcoming attitude and professionalism is that the remembered me after 7+ yrs.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< Gmap_id>

<text>Five stars handd down!

What an amazing facility and a great team. Very clean, very secure. Plenty of easy access to get your stuff in and out, from the first phone call after signing up on the web, you are treated like family. Yeah I know, cliché, but it’s true. Integrity from the start and all through the informative and simple contact process. Cindy let me inspect the last unit of the size I wanted on the first floor. Both ladies were knowledgeable, friendly, funny and helpful. You will not be disappointed when you choose Extra Space Storage. It was nice and cool walking the wide halls, there’ are carts available at the entry points, lights are automatically turned on & off as you move through the aisles.

It is by far the cleanest storage facility I’ve seen and I’ve been to more than a few. "A guy with a truck," is always the first person you call on moving day. Yep I’m that guy. Go see this friendly and very funny Team off professionals at Extra Space Storage, you won’t be sorry. Tell them Shane sent you and get a free joke with every rental. 😂< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

i originally had a 3x5 storage unit, but i came in yesterday because i needed a larger one immediately and very last minute. i am very greatful for Marion, who helped me get the best deal i could! i am now paying less for a larger unit, 4x10, then what i was paying for a 3x5. i was going through some emotional things and she was also there for me as a friend. she gave me extra time after the property closed to move my things in as she knew i was in an emergency and wanted to help as much as she could. being  part of extra space storage in monterey is something i am very thankful for, and every single employee there puts there customers best interests a priority.<//Text>

The associates were nice and helpful. They were kind to our daughter who was with us and showed us multiple units so we could determine the correct size. Unfortunately, the unit size we settled on was a smelly unit, like cigarette smoke. We will have to spray the unit ourselves to try to get the smell out as we are not smokers and don't want our things to smell of it. Even though these units are not environment controlled, we got a 2nd story, indoor unit, which should be sufficient. We are storing our entire house temporarily, due to a military situation. They had a good deal online, which they honored in store and will pro rate the final month. They supply everything you'll need for packing and the really nice locks. Just signed a lease today, so we'll see how it works out.</Review>

<text>The staff I encountered the day I initiated my space lease, two ladies, were very helpful and courteous.   I actually first attempted an online reservation, which was completed, and then got a phone call from the staff within one hour of my confirmation.   They are very on top of their flow of vacancy and spaces.

When I physically arrived, they gave me accurate and detailed descriptions regarding the spaces available, and were straight forward about pricing and the pricing fluxes that I may encounter throughout the year depending on the market.  Good to know so I won't be surprised about anything later.

I felt my belongings would be safe and they conveyed that impression very well.  They became aware I had just moved into the area and were extremely welcoming in their attitude towards me and my wife as newcomers.   They clearly explained the logistics of getting into and out of the facilities and efficiently handled the computer process of my leasing agreement.  They also answered plenty of my hypothetical situation issues and I definitely have peace of mind with my belongings here.   It is a good location with adequate parking and loading spaces.  If you're on the fence, stop hesitating before your ideal space gets taken.<//text>< Date>

Cindy at the Monterey location was awesome, she runs (i think) that location and does an awesome job. She was super helpful and helped me understand their offerings and how to best maximize their offerings. I definitely recommend, mostly because of how easy it was to work with Cindy.

<Text>My mom called from another state, ahead of her move, and talked to Cindy. Cindy was really friendly and concerned with how to help my mom out. Since I already live in the area I went over to check out the facility. Cindy was kind enough to help us through the process. She made sure we got the best storage space size for my mom’s needs and was very accommodating. It was one less worry off of my mom’s shoulders before her move here. The facility looks clean and cared for and I am comfortable with the neighborhood it is in as well.</Text>< pictures>

If I could I would make this review a 10+.
The best team ever.  Marion, the manager, is incredible.  She knows how to keep client's calm during most stressful times:  MOVING!
Incredibly clean spaces.

The most caring, commanding and upbeat service, i felt like i was completely being taken care of to feel comfortable and completely secure. The manager went way beyond what was necessary or expected, i felt like i was met by the mythological ferrywoman to guide me and my things across the river. I couldn't give a more glowing review.< /Text>

Best staff I have ever dealt with at any storage establishment. Very pleasant people who love their jobs and dislike faculty meetings. Even gave me a free cup of coffee. And I know what you're thinking 'it's just a free cup of coffee'. Wrong, it was the best of cup of free coffee that I've ever had. Strongly recommended to anyone who needs storage with an amazing staff.< /Review>

This storage facility was mentioned to me by a close friend. So of course I went, the customer service at extra space in Monterey is excellent. I was greeted with smiles and it wasn't just about getting money out of me. Marion was very professional, and kind. My overall experience was great and I would recommend this storage facility to everyone. Make it your first choice.<//Text>

I used this storage facility twice over the past 4 years & the biggest factor on why I keep returning is because Marion & Liz are the absolute best! It's because of kind, sweet, positive people like Marion & Liz that make customers like me excited to come back to a business. Liz helped me a couple years ago with getting me set up with a storage unit & it was a delightful breeze! Marion helped me this time around & her attention to detail, making sure I had the best unit for my needs & just being overall considerate of my feedback makes her a ROCKSTAR! They both are honestly! The facility is always clean & I love all the added security with multiple security camera's, large screens displayed in the office of all the surveillance cameras around the property, individual access codes to get in through the gate & gate access hours. I have never had an issues with bugs or anything harmful to my belongings in my entire time with this Extra Space Storage facility on Dela Vina Ave., Monterey. I highly recommend this location to anybody looking for a safe, clean and awesome place to store your belongings!< /text>

< Review>
Spent the last couple of days looking around the Monterey area for a good storage place. This facility works very well for me. Feels secure and weather resistant (cool and humid around here). But what really sold me are the folks that work there, especially Cindy. She met me the first time I was there and showed me around, graciously foregoing diving into her lunch at the time. When I came back a couple of days later to rent a unit she was just as gracious and thoughtful, along with Marion, who was also there this time. Customer service with a smile! Highly recommended.<//Review>

The women at this location are absolutely wonderful!  They were so helpful and positive.  The unit I had reserved online didn't meet my needs so they quickly jumped in and helped me find a unit that would work better, and gave me a discount too.  This location is clean, well cared for and easy to access. I'm happy I chose Extra Space in Monterey!< /Review>

The ladies at Extra Space Storage have gone the extra mile for me. They've been sweet every time I walk into the office and they have been more than accommodating when it comes to my storage needs. Their price is also the best in town! If you have a storage need, they are most definitely recommended by me!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been very satisfied storing here for the past 2 years. The facilities are kept in good, clean shape, and seem competitively priced, especially given their convenient location. But what really sets this place apart for me is the excellent service and friendly, professional staff. I really feel like the on site team is "in my corner" ... I often notice there's a little more cheer and mirth in my step when I leave the office, which I really appreciate as I set about tackling my storage tasks.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>After looking for a storage for a couple days I came across Extra Space Storage in Monterey I talked to Cindy on the phone first and she was very nice and helpful. When I came to the location to rent my storage not only was Cindy nice and helpful she was very pleasant. She explained everything to me in detail and was very professional . Being in retail I really like the service I received from Cindy. Cindy is a real strong asset to this location . Thank you and keep up the good work .

Thanks again,

I'm a student at CSUMB and I needed a place to store my things over the summer. I reserved a spot online and I came in and got a tour of the facility. It was extremely clean, organized, and safe. Cindy, the one that helped me was very friendly and had a genuine interest in helping me.

I came back to get my things and everything went smoothly. If I ever had a problem, Cindy was extremely kind and understanding. I stand by this storage facility!! Genuine customer service and a very safe community, what more can you ask for.<//text>

When I received a call from Marion after signing up on the website, I knew I had found the right place to store my belongings.  I had quite an attitude when Marion called and I rudely said "Well if I could get off the phone with you then maybe I can let you know what time I will make it".  I was having a bad day and rushing to pack and Marion's kind tone did not waver.  She did not respond to my rudeness but instead asked what she could do to help me and that I could talk to her whenever I got a chance.  I did call back and apologize and Marion never was rude (she had every right to be) and was totally professional and helpful.  When I arrived, she and the staff greeted me  and my son .like we were old friends.  Marion even explained some questions I had about the location of stores in the area and wished me the best in my move.  Marion then went on to explain everything about the rental agreement and sent me an email that included a copy of the contract.  Marion is a real gem to Extra Space Storage; I just hope the company knows how she made our day.<//text>< rating>

I have used Extra Space Storage for over 81/2 yrs as part of my work. The staff has been very friendly, extremely helpful in informing us when work related packages arrive and do everything possible to help us. Courteous does not fully describe their attitude towards our company.
I would recommend Extra Space Storage for anyone!!<//Review>

Liz was very helpful and professional. I signed up for a space from the internet and she followed up by calling me the next day. She showed me the space I requested along w other possible options. Most importantly she was quick and efficient while being very nice! The unit is easy to get to and so is the location. They have great hours and I'm glad I picked them !< /Text>

We only needed to rent a space for about 3wks for our wedding. They accommodated us at a fair price and even upgraded us  to a larger unit that had easier access from the outside for our truck. Would definetely use them again. Thanks again.<//text>< Pictures>

The Site Manager Cindy was very helpful in getting a perfect unit for a short term lease during the summer.  Her advisement on how to finish our registration by going to  a Extra Space Storage facility in Orange County made the process very easy and simple to rent this unit.< /Text>

The month I rented a unit from them, a clean, respectable- all walk-no talk unit, 5x8 maybe? Anyway, my experience was overall a great one and if I ever had to rent a unit again in the seaside area, I would see no reason for going any place else. The staff are extremely friendly and I found myself sticking around just to chat on a number of occasions. An all around friendly place.< /Text>

Saved me in a crunch! Best pricing in the area. Friendly customer service reps! Willing to work with military members! Wish I could give 10 stars! Don't go to public storage come here!</Review>

The Site Manager Cindy was very helpful in getting a perfect unit for a short term lease during the summer.  Her advisement on how to finish our registration by going to  a Extra Space Storage facility in Orange County made the process very easy and simple to rent this unit.</review>

Excellent customer service! Clean and secure facility . Lots of options in size. Indoor and outdoor with  carts for easy loading. We only needed to rent a space for about 3wks for our wedding. They accommodated us at a fair price and even upgraded us  to a larger unit that had easier access from the outside for our truck. Would definetely use them again. Thanks again.</review>

First, I received a great rate over the phone. Then, Marion in the office was extremely helpful in notifying me that I chose a move-in date when the office would be closed, so we changed that. When I showed up, she was extremely helpful, polite, and prompt.< /text>

This Extra Space storage location is your worst nightmare.  I went to help move my mother in-law who is 80 years old.  The elevator was broken so we had to wheel her boxes down 2 flights of stairs to get them out of the space.  In addition, the sensors for the one way direction gates were broken so you could not get out of the facility!  Customers were climbing over fences to go around to the front gate to get in and out.  How is an 80 year old woman supposed to do that?  In addition, the "managers" would not answer their phone so customers could report the hazard!  What if someone had a heart attack or serious health issue as a result of the moving?  Extra Space, was completely unresponsive when we shared our experience.  Thank God all their locations are not this disrespectful.  It was one of the worst "customer service" experiences of my life.</text>

This is THE place to store your stuff. The staff is friendly, understanding, and always there to help. I like the way the office is set up, right when you enter the building, then take the express elevator up and I'm right at my unit. One time I lost my key to my lock, the girls really know their power tools, brought in the big saw and cut that lock like a pro!! Really a humble kind of crowd, never a dull moment at this storage place. And a restroom for customer's that rivals most 5 star resorts!  Climate controlled units, totally secure and in beautiful down town Monterey. A great place to store your bike, Del Monte bike trail is right there!</Review>

<Review>Marion, the store manager, and her staff are absolutely amazing! They go above and beyond to help their customers. I ran into some tricky situations with a bad moving company and some furniture that I needed to give away when I moved out of my unit. The staff at Extra Space helped me out tremendously. I cannot say enough good things about this company!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I can't say enough great things about Liz, Marion and Danielle.  I have been a corporate tenant for nearly a year and they go out of their way to be accommodating.  Whenever I have had an issue, they are quick to resolve it.  If you are looking for a well managed and secure storage facility, then I enthusiastically would encourage you to go with ExtraSpace Storage in Monterey.  They have competitive rates and excellent service.  I know because I have been using facilities for more than 20 years, and there is none better in my opinion!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1494955165278, 'text': 'We are thrilled to hear about your awesome experience with Extra Space, Ron.

I have moved around quite a bit in the area and have always found a storage useful and necessary. I have certainly had a rollercoaster of emotions when it comes to the search of and the hospitality of the workers of a storage facility. it was not until very recently that i went to Extra Space in Monterey and met with Liz and Cindy. They are the sweetest and most down to earth women and they made this stressful experience, make me feel extremely welcomed and memorable, hence the review. I am not sure that i would have rented a space here if not for Liz and Cindy. They were kind, and they offered me compliments as well as compliments of my 4 year old daughter. Thank you Liz and Cindy for making my experience memorable and for making a difficult process, fun and easy. As long as they are there, ill be a customer of Extra Space Monterey.</text><UserId.>116232814897656268032</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I just have to give this facility a major %110 in customer service my experiece is alway amazing, you see I have rented here in the past and I wouldn't go anywhere else Ms. Marion & Liz are truly two awesome team players. Always professional and anticipated my needs as soon as I walked in the door. Safety is a very big issue for me, because of some personal set backs my family has been misplaced and its extremly important that our things are kept in a safe and secure facility . And just knowing  the caliber and integrity of your facility and "Marion & Liz" I can rest assured and not give it a second thought , as well as I'm able to sleep at night . Thank you so very much for all you do !!!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Obviously the customer service! I look forward to going to my storage unit and especially when i'm in a bad mood because the staff always cheers me up!  Their all great but Liz has the best sense of humor :). They are the best of any business with follow up calls and application procedures! No B.S. Or complications!  There also lenient with some protocol, for example i wanted a different storage locker, not only did they keep an eye out for the one that i was hoping for but they let me transfer at no cost!  I believe that is actual better for business in most circumstances in the long run! I've been there a year now and don't think i'll be leaving anytime soon.< /Text>

<Text>It's a little pricier than some given it's proximity to Monterey, but it's definitely worth it for the professionalism and hospitality of the staff. Any time I had a problem with anything, they went above and beyond to solve my problem. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for storage in the Monterey area.<//Text>< UserId.>

<review>Like the other reviewer, I called several places before renting from Extra Space Storage. I found the other places to be overpriced, and got the impression that they couldn't really care less if I rented from them or not. Marion at Extra Space made me feel welcome, and was extremely helpful. The fact that the unit price was literally almost half of what the other mainstream rental place wanted was a bonus.<//review><user_name>Jason Lombard< /user_name><response>None<//response><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

<Review>I would like everyone to know how great the folks were at Extra Space Storage in Monterey.  I was driving a loaded uhaul truck up from San Diego, got to Monterey exhausted and the staff at extra storage were so helpful and quick to finalize my access to my space.  I would not think about using anyone but Extra Space Storage.<//Review>< Pictures>
