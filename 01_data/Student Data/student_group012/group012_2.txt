Anytime Plumbing was called out to rooter a plugged bathroom drain.  I was grateful that they came.  The technician wanted to camera the line and gave me a quote but I decline because I had recently had that done and was aware of where the roots were.  It turned out that he ran the camera anyway and when I protested, he changed the name of the charge on my bill to “exam”, but my bill was the same as his original quote WITH CAMERA.   Now I’ve never before had a plumber charging a $125 or so for an “EXAM”, but Anytime Plumbing is defending this charge even though they performed work that I specifically asked them not to do.  To make it worse, the rooter job only lasted 24 hours and I had to call another company to rooter the drain again.  anytime Plumbing said that they would not warrantee their work.  The other company has a 90 day warrantee written right in their invoice.  Not Anytime.</text>

I was having a new refrigerator installed in my kitchen.  I did not have an up to date water line.  Mario responded to my residence in a timely manner.  Mario installed a water line and shut off valve that was code compliant.  I was able to install the water line for my ice maker and water dispenser without any problems.  Mario has assisted me in the past with other plumbing issues.  Mario is professional and performs the work that is requested.<//Review>

<Text>Our main line backed up at 3pm on a Saturday. We called Anytyme after quickly calling a few family members for a recommendation. They were quick to respond and arrived at our house within the hour- which was really lucky! They were communicative throughout the process and fix, and were extremely reasonably priced (especially for a Saturday!). I highly recommend them in an emergency or anytime, they do excellent work.

**Edited to add we’ve had Anytyme out twice more since those - once for a large job fixing our mail line and once for a small job. Both times they were efficient and did a great job for a reasonable price. I continue to recommend them to anyone I know who needs a plumber.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dc74fc1d433ac5:0x659655a956098f5d</GmapID>< Rating>

<text>I had noticed our water heater was leaking so we called our home warranty and they had 800 Anytyme Plumbing come out to take a look. Frank Moreno was sent out as our technician and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. It was a two day process because the inspection was done later in the evening the same day we called our home warranty claim. Frank came back the next day to replace it with a brand new water heater, work was done while my wife and I were at work and Frank and his other technician left the work done clean, professional and complete. Frank explained to us the whole process in detail, called me after he left with a follow up of instructions and thanked us for the business. What a great guy, 800 Anytyme Plumbing is lucky to have him as an employee!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLt_SytdU1f4drg-cpbPiX7qHJFq6lYYuf1UnA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhukNlor7QLjcrpftv6phIXpsG2GpL8idcntHA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_q54xbP_KAIdSZnwd7O6H09yQ3G2JhuTivZ65=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

Timely service, Work performed was very good, However, I felt it a little on the expensive side, and I didn't feel the pre inspection was done properly, a lot of time spent re-puchasing  parts originally ordered incorrectly.  Not the actual service technicians fault. All in all I would re-hire this company. JB<//Text>

I filled up on line REQUEST FOR SERVICE, then after a couple of minutes someone from the office called me for details. I am surprised to see Cesar O. in our doorsteps  after 30 minutes.
He installed new pipes replacing the old ones for three hours more or less with excellent workmanship. He did a great job, offer and give me a discount...very cool and professional.  I greatly advise homeowners like me if they got plumbing needs they should call 1-800-ANYTIME.  WITH THESE AWESOME JOB I RATE THEM 5 STARS.</Text>

The other companies  were unable to fix it and said we should just buy a new one.  1-800-Anytyme's technician Robert La Russa looked at our A/C and spent the time to truly diagnose what the issue was and fixed it. We are very grateful for his expertise especially  because there has been poor air quality due to the recent fires. Now we can close the windows and run the A/C again!

I am a restaurant owner.
I recently had a job done from this company.
Because I had  issue with my AC Unit which caused leakage which destroyed one of the lighting on the ceiling as well.
Anyways, It was first day we were open since the middle of March when we were closed due to covid-19. It was already bad enough, now I had this problem in My hand. I knew I had to fix this issue as quickly as possible because I couldn’t turn on the AC so It was scorching hot. The technician by name of David came and after He looked at it He said this was two man job and said it would be $2200. After he said that, I really wanted to call different company but this was Friday So timing wasn’t really on my side and I needed to fix this issue soon as possible. So Finally Including
His Diagnostic fee, $2000 was the final number and he told me the owner gave him the green light but later  on it magically changed to $2100 including his diagnostic fee.
So Right now i am doing some research on line and pretty much I feel like they jerked me meaning They overcharged the hell out of me.
I strongly feel that It shouldn’t have went over $1000.
But  I guess I really had no choice because this was pretty darn emergency and that extra $100 I ended up giving them definitely  even made me feel worse.
I mean they did decent job and but definitely not worth of $2100.
I do not recommend this company at all.
They are way too pricey.
Don’t make a mistake I made.< /text>

<text>I called late on a Saturday morning because my water heater was leaking. A technician came to my house by 3:30 pm to install a new water heater. He did a super job of removing the old leaking heater and installing a new one including adding some upgrades to bring my system in compliance with some new codes. I was very happy with the timeliness and quality of the work. I highly recommend 1-800-anytyme and crew.I called late on a Saturday morning because my water heater was leaking.

Great service, quality work and would definitely use again.

Called late at night, and George F. was out the next morning. George diagnosed the pipe leak issue quickly, replaced the pipe, and gave me a long term solution (water filtration system) as well. He and Mario F. were back at my place that afternoon to install a water filtration system (with a sweet discount) in my garage, and they did a great job. Clean, and very professional looking installation.

Thanks guys!< /review>

Update: Got another service on 4/30/2021 to replace the sewer pipe and install a clean out. Excellent work by Bryan and Russell.

We asked for service on a Sunday morning and Frank came to check out the plumbing issue a couple hours later. We were surprised how quick the were to respond! Frank clearly explained the issue and fixed it right away. Thanks for the great service!<//review>

Technician Frank Moreno did a fantastic job. Anytime sent out Frank within a couple of hours after I found a leak in my water heater.  Excellent customer service, very professional, efficient and friendly. It is refreshing to see you can still get fantastic service. Robert serviced my heating and cooling system and also did a great job. Kudos to both gentlemen!  Anytime installed my water heater, heating and cooling system, very satisfied would call them back ANYTYME!</Review>

I was desperate after my hot water heater gave up the ghost.  A co-worker suggested 1-800-anytyme.  They were able to come out the same day, and explained everything that was going on.  Mario was pleasant and professional and put my mind at ease.  He and Brent worked quickly to get my hot water up and running again at a fair price!<//Review>

We met with Ryan on one of the hottest days in San Diego.  After 20 years of service, our AC and furnace needed replacing.  It was a hard pill to swallow but Ryan was wonderful.  He explained everything completely and confirmed the replacement would begin the same day.  Ryan was courteous and professional.  He checked on the service technicians throughout the day and assisted with the cleanup.  Thank you Ryan.</Review>

I live in an apartment and had the mainline clogged impacting multiple units. The landlord sent a plumber out on a Saturday morning, cleared and camera'ed it. The lad was very professional. He chatted with my son, and even cleared our kitchen drain of grease. I would recommend 1-800-anytyme for your plumbing needs.<//review>

John the technician was a clear and respectful communicator about our work, and he was consistently careful with keeping the work area clean and returned our home to it’s original state. I was also alerted by text prior to arrival and call center people were thorough as well. A definite thumbs up 👍 for the good and detailed work completed and It tells me that when I have another need, I'll call 800-AnyTyme without hesitation - “Thank you!”</Review>

On a Sunday,  I was trying to take off a hose from a cheap rusted spigot in my backyard in preparation for my daughter's upcoming birthday party. (I new it was an issue and tried not to break the spigot while trying to loosen the hose with W-4O etc).  Despite my efforts, the spigot broke off and I got shot in the face with water. After I shut off the water, I called several "Open All The Time" plumbers.  They all said they were busy.   Finally, I called Anytime; they came on a Sunday. The Tech Frank was great.  A few hours later, I had a new copper spigot and my wife was glad to have the water back on.</Text>

Called because pilot light on wall furnace would not stay lit.  Service fee was $69.00 which after calling two other companies a great price.  Unfortunately my furnace is old and needs complete new unit.  Asked for a estimate and was shocked $3285 for unit and installation.  The young gentlemen was very nice, respectful, and tolerated my dogs. Offered me zero percent interest on financing for 12-18 months.  I respectfully decided to wait and seek out more information.  Upon doing this, I found out that the unit price at Home Depot is only $724.00 and asked a couple of people installation costs, totaling $1200-1400.  Needless to say, always get 3 estimates on everything you have replaced. Service was great, but in the end, extremely to high in price for me to have them replace the furnace.</text>

I  want give this company “ No Star”
Last Friday my main water pipe was broken, because insurance said no cover this case ask me call plumber, Ryan took a quick look charge me $6600.00 not include put back concrete, I don’t have this experience before and just want the water not leaking, so I put down my initial, ask him start as soon as possible, he said come on next Monday, I said I can’t wait, so at last one worker come on Sat half day, may be they charge me like emergency hour, but when I talk to my friend, neighbor, all said this is over charge, they helped me call to three different plumbing they gave me free estimate not like Ryan charged me $125.00 first, they said like this case around $3500.00 or leases, so I called in want talk to the owner, but next day is Celley called back, one of my friend is Adjudicator, he said the company should write down the description of the project, cost of materials, days for working, time start & time done, how many worker.....one thing the workers are nice, Frank & Charlie, but it is impossible charge $ 6600.00 for only 25 feet water main pipe and don’t put back the concrete, he encouraged me go to Supreme Court, beside this I told all my friends don’t use Anytyme, the owner should know what are employees he hired, if the owner is smart he should know how to handle this problem, otherwise we will see each other soon.< /text>

We keep the service fee low with zero profit and obviously the repair would be quoted after the issue is diagnosed.  Upon arrival at your home and with the new knowledge from the Mrs. that the clogged drain was a “systemic recurring issue,” our technician recommended a camera inspection to visually see the underlining cause.  And no doubt, we know from experience that the problem will recur if we ‘Band-Aid’ the job and thus, we would rather decline work than to offer an unviable solution. In addition, since it was a recurring issue, and therefore you must have had this drain cleared or “Band-Aided” before, did any licensed plumber do it for $39?  Without a camera inspection to understand the cause, and to fix it at its underlying cause, your drain issue will not get resolved.'}<//Resp>< pics>

We have always been happy with the service from Anytyme.  They are quick to respond and the technician they sent this time (Nat M) was very knowledgeable and quick to respond.  We will definitely use this company again.  We have had them for plumbing, air conditioning and furnace problems.  Very dependable, reliable service each time.<//text>

5-stars for this company.  We have used them over the years and find them to be professional and knowledgeable.  In the last home visit, we had them fix a small leaking pipe and the technician noticed that the water heater pan had water accumulation.  Turned out, the tank had a slow leak.  We were so thankful that the leak was identified early.< /Text>

This is the right plumber! I had a clogged kitchen sink and they were so helpful. First Tony came, he was timely and easy to talk to. He let me know the cost and what he was doing. The problem was bad enough that another plumber was called who had a longer snake. The cost went up some but the communication was always clear. Then Alex came and he arrived sooner then I had expected. It was great because every minute my kitchen is not a happy place. Alex was such a professional. He knocked out the problem very fast and gave me really good tips on how to care for my drain. I didn't know it is best to "care" for you drain, it's one of those things you ignore. Alex was great and I so appreciate his professionalism, well worth every penny!< /text>

Had an AC problem on Sunday . Called all over looking for someone to come to my home and check it out right away. I really needed the AC to work with the heat. Waited for several companies to call back , but they never did. A couple called hours later and said they couldn’t come over until Monday through Friday .
But Anytyme responded to my call right away.
They even sent me a text with the name and picture of the technician , Israel. He showed up soon after the text, and was able to figure what was wrong right away. He was friendly and professional, and after figuring out what was up with my AC, he had it working again. Thank you again Israel  and Anytyme for saving us on a hot weekend when so many other companies let us down.<//text>

First rate outfit.  Appointment between 12-3 PM; they called at 11:30 and were here right at Noon.  Cesar O. is very friendly and professional.  They gave an estimate right up front.  Had to snake out the kitchen drain and was done in 40 minutes.  I would recommend 1-800 Anytime.</Review>

Called late in the evening with a hot water heater issue. Answering service took the call and said someone would call back within the hour. Within 5 minutes they called and set an appointment for the next day. Technicians were courteous and professional, diagnosed the problem quickly and saved me money as well. Very happy with the service.<//Text>

<Review>I was surprised by this company.  Elbert gave us the best quote of 4 companies on a sewer main repair service.  He came out last night and gave us a quote and thought it would only run about 2 to 3 hours, but because it was late, he wasn't able to knock it out last night.  Another member, Frank, came out today to knock out the job.  The project ran a bit longer than the expected 3 hours, but Frank wanted to make sure it was done right.  And much to my surprise, the price I was quoted was the price I paid without even getting some sort of run around.  Great guys, great company.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dc74fc1d433ac5:0x659655a956098f5d<//gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1577463855338, 'text': 'Glad to hear that the repair to your sewer main was successful, Wesley!

Tony showed up at the exact moment I hit my driveway.  As it turns out, he did the same repair when I bought my house in 2012.  He recognized me, the house, and the kitchen!  He was thorough and professional and very friendly all at the same time.  He made sure it was 100% fixed and then we did the paperwork.  I highly recommend this company, and if you are lucky enough to get Tony on the job, you will most definitely be pleased!</Text>

He was done in no time and did a great job. Very reasonable cost too.  I recommend 1-800-Anytyme  for your plumbing needs.< /Review>

Jim Blaylock Was awesome. He was polite, listened to me explain exactly what I wanted to accomplish, and helped me come up with a perfect solution. He quoted me a price, and when we opened up the wall it was a mess! Even though it took longer than expected, he honored his original price and stood by his word. I highly recommend him, he gets my business next time I need some electrical work done.< /Text>

It was evident that he cared about the quality of his work and was thorough with his evaluation.  The most impressive thing about David was that he went the extra effort.  He came out of our attic with two boxes of trash that was left from the installation and took the time to gather it and take it out!  I would never had known if there was trash up there.  He also did minor repairs of resetting insulation and sealing of a gap in the duct.  Thank you Dave, would request you for any repairs or installation needs.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Name>

< Review>
Driving by a neighbor's home, I saw a 1-800-AnyTyme crew installing a water treatment system. Mario took the time to introduce me to the business and was most courteous and professional. I then called Celly at 1-800-AnyTyme and had Robert come to our home. They were most professional, patient, and knowledgeable. We decided to install an identical water system and, who came to install it, but their master plumber Mario! We were so pleased. Mario's skill and experience made a difficult install look so easy. He was most pleasant, courteous, respectful, efficient, and instructional. He was also a great tutor to Brett, the junior member of the crew. Mario, Robert, Celly, Skye, Brett, Catherine, and all the folks we worked with at 1-800-AnyTyme were courteous, rock-solid professionals who strove for perfection and high customer satisfaction. I had such a good experience with them that they have now become our homes plumber, and now we will use them to replace our complex AC system, and our hot water heater, too. Do not hesitate to use 1-800-AnyTyme...you will not be sorry.< /Review>

We woke up on a Saturday morning with water in our garage. We called 1-800-anytyme and in no time they sent a technician who showed us the leak on the water heater and had it replaced the same day. Their price was less than the water heater experts.< /Review>

<Review>Anytyme Plumbing was punctual, professional and affordable. In my case, they sent a licensed plumber within 30 minutes and fixed the problem very fast and professionally. Especially the plumber George F. was very helpful and knowledgeable.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc74fc1d433ac5:0x659655a956098f5d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Our request for service was answered promptly, the the technician, Alex, called before arrival and did an excellent job checking out our plumbing issue. He was able to remove the shower faucet which was too difficult for my husband to do, as he didn't have the proper tools. He was a complete professional and was very polite. We would certainly recommend your company to our family, friends and neighbors. We are happy to support our local businesses, and you can count on us to call again if additional work is required.

this testimony is regarding the warranty of services provided.  I experienced a problem after a work was finished.  Your company was quick to arrive and determine that the problem was covered under the warranty of services provided only a few months earlier.  Your honesty,  professionalism and responsibility speak volumes to me.<//text>

<text>George F. fixed my water heater without any issues.  Very personable, fast, and clean job.  Anytyme Plumbing emailed me a picture of George before he arrived so that I would know what he looked like.  I got 3 estimates for this job and Anytyme came out in the middle.  Customer service is what made me go with AnyTyme.  Hopefully I won't need a plumber any time soon, but if I do I'll go with them again.  I highly recommend them.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I have been using 1800AnyTyme services for several years. They are the first number I dial when I have a plumbing problem. David provided a very clear explanation of the issues, stated the cost in full at the outset and completed the project on time. His craftsmanship is excellent.< /Review>

Second use of this Company. This time service was quoted at $89. However Nate charged our house-sitter $129 and did not discount the promised 10% coupon (for the 2nd visit). When I called for an invoice correction I was promised action - but nothing happened. While Nate was cordial and professional, I can't afford to use this Company any more<//Text>

My 81 year old mother needed a plumber to come and fix a leaking outdoor spigot that she uses to water the whole yard. She lives on SS and has to be frugal, so we tried 1-800-Any-Tyme to see if they could come out. They sent someone within an hour and Tony the plumber fixed the problem with some effort on his part, using a torch and other tools. He was smiling, courteous, closed the gate going in and out and got the job done. We will call this business every time we need repairs, big or small. The even worked on the price a bit to accommodate my mothers fix income expenses she is able to pay without affecting her living expenses.< /Text>

First to Review
I can't express enough how exceptional the service I received from ALEX, MARIO, RUSSLE& STEVE from Anytime Plumbing. This was also the only company that would quote a basic service fee. What started as a simple drain stoppage, required replacement of drain pipes under slap as well redirect drain from laundry facilities in garage. This was not a simple task due to previous slap repair & obstacles left behind by previous service companies. I was so impressed with the extra steps they took that was above & beyond their task at hand. The work was done fast & efficient, area was left clean & neat as if they were never here. Alex thoroughly explained the work plan as well as arrange affordable financing. Job well done.<//Review>

I had a pretty difficult attic furnace install and they had no problems getting everything perfect. Cannot say enough good things about this experience!

A prior plumbing company, which shall remain unnamed, performed a less than acceptable installation of a new kitchen sink for me. Mr. Mario Frausto of 1800 Anytime came out and corrected the problem. Mr. Frausto was prompt, efficient and very pleasant. I wouldn't hesitate to and will use 1800 Anytime for my future plumbing needs.< /Review>

It was time to invest in a new Heater/AC and after obtaining a few bids, I went with 800Anytime. Travis came in with a reasonable estimate and was super knowledgable. Nate, Russ and Raul were the team who executed and were all very friendly, professional guys. I would use them again.< /Text>

Called AnyTyme as we had a serious problem with the drain stoppage. George was very punctual, and as we were not sure what the cause was, George made all effort to identify the problem, which he found out it was caused by a root of the tree cracking into the pipe and causing the stoppage. After finding the cause, George scheduled the construction the following day digging out the pipe and replacing it with a new one. At the end George was able to fix the problem in two days, which I believe was an amazing job  I was in the impression it will take a week to get it fixed and we had to stay at a hotel for a week.<//text>

<review>I told the guy on the phone that I probably had a leak.  He said that it would be ~$550 to fill up my 5lb AC with freon and another $520 for a leak detection kit.  So I said I'd call around.  Then I talked to another company and they said that freon is $28 per pound and that the leak kit is 80$.  So these guys are obvious crooks.  On the positive side they were willing to come out right away (to steal my money).  My advice is keep searching.< /review></record>

having once owned a kitchen and bath remodeling company, I know how important customer service is.  Whoever trained your workers did a good job.What a wonderful and carefree job they did.  I am not one of those customers who are in your back pocket;  I  figure that it was quite obvious they knew what they were doing, and I would leave it to the professionals.  When I heard t, Iwas astonished.he vacuum cleaner going I was quite astonished.  It looks as through they were never here.  Thank you soooo much.< /Text>

{'time': 1528303161478, 'text': 'Dear Mr. Bestmann, while most water heater manufacturers agree that an average water heater should last between 6-10 years.  And, some homeowners find their water heaters working beyond 10 years.\nAdversely, we have seen water heaters fail well before 6 years.  Additionally, CA has required Ultra low NOX Water Heaters (40 and 50 gal) in the recent few years.  Our company wants to provide customers with a long-term solution while meeting CA codes.  Depending on the make of your water heater, most reputable manufacturers have warranties up to 6 years - in which case, we would coordinate getting it replaced and installed for you only at our labor cost.  Do you know if this is the case with your water heater?'}< /Response>

I have a 1953 house with the main heat source a wall heater in the living room.  I noticed the pilot light had gone out so after reading reviews on line for several different companies I called AnyTyme since the reviews were the most impressive, and set up an appt. for the next day.  The technician (Ryan) was delayed because of a big plumbing job, and because of this the service call fee was waived.  Plus I received a $33 discount for booking the appt. on a Friday.  I was called a couple of times just to let me know Ryan's progress on the other job and when he would arrive.  The problem was a faulty thermocouple that needed to be ordered directly from the manufacturer of the heater.  Ryan was very professional, polite, had a good sense of humor (which for me counts a lot), and on his visit a few days later, part in hand, installed it quickly.  He never tried to talk me into buying a new heating system and made sure to subtract the discount and not charge me the service call fee.

I will recommend AnyTyme Plumbing to my friends and will definitely call them first if I have another problem (either heating OR plumbing.<//text>

HOWEVER, they left damage and mess behind...chipped bathroom sink (reported but not fixed) and dried-on patching material on floors and step-stool (after reporting, they returned and removed).  But, most importantly, in July 2013 my contractor was installing a bedroom ceiling fan and discovered in the attic space that Anytyme had crushed and broken the air duct in that area when installing the new pipes (Anytyme did not mention this to me nor did they attempt to fix it).  The consequences of this gross negligence would be that when heat is turned on, the warm air would flow into the attic instead of into the room below.  I had my electrical contractor go ahead and fix the air duct, at an additional cost to me, instead of having to deal with Anytyme anymore!  I will never use this company again.< /Review>< pics>

<review>I had been using a different plumbing company for several years, and I was
not happy with the way they always seemed to end up charging more than
the original quote. Cesar arrived on time, was very courteous, cleared the
problem drain, and charged exactly what they said it would be.
I will definitely continue to use Cesar and his company.

<review>Tony was curteous and quick to respond.  He did a good job snaking the tub.  The issue I have was two days later when the original backup in the tub wasnt the problem and finding out I have a main sewer blockage not a bathtub clog.  After running a load of laundry the toilet overflooded everywhere!!!  I shut the water off and cleaned up.  I called the local dispatch number who basically said he unclogged the tub so he did his job and they could send someone else out to see what else needs to be done.  Unfortunately, after having another plumber come out they stated it should of been noticed immediately that the tub was not the issue especially with the bubbles in the toilet when running the shower water.  The company had poor customer service and did not hold to their top rule which is “Treat our clients as we would treat a member of our own family.”  Geez I would sure hate to be their family.</review>< Pictures>

<name>David Bullock</name><Text>We recently had a jammed Badger 0.5HP In-sink-erator unit and called Any-Tyme out to assist.

The plumber arrived (Cesar) who promptly declared the unit "burned out" after only trying to turn it on at the wall, even though it hummed when you turned it on.  He then proceeded to quote my wife $440.00 to replace it.

He ignored the fact that it was still making a very audible humming noise, nor did he try loosening the stuck blade or using an Allen wrench to dislodge the blockage.

When my wife asked me if it was OK (I was in the other room working), I told her no.  Cesar immediately countered that Any-Tyme did not want to lose our business and asked "How much would you be willing to pay?" and when my wife was confused, he immediately dropped his quote to $300.00 to replace the unit and started waffling about whether the unit could be made to work again or needed replacing.  He kept pressing but I told my wife to stand firm.

Thinking it was an isolated case of a dishonest and predatory technician, I called the dispatcher at the company -- they proudly claim to be family owned so I thought they would want to know.  They quickly pulled up our file and confirmed the plumber's name.  I explained the problem to her and she said she understood why the situation would make us doubt their integrity.  I asked for another quote, and she indicated that she had no price book and took my number to have their head person call me back.

I was disappointed that they made no effort to call me back and remedy the situation.  I've told me wife that we're not to consider using them in the future, and let our neighbors know to beware if they should find themselves dealing with Any-Tyme.

After talking to some family about this, at their suggestion I went out and bought a $1.30 1/4" Allen Wrench at Ace Hardware and was able to free to blockage in the disposal in 2 minutes by inserting it into the bottom of the unit and turning it both directions.  It's now working fine again.  No burned out motor, no new unit, no ripoff.</Text>< rating>

<review>I went in today to get a propane tank and have it filled! When I got there , there was a young lady getting off work and was leaving. She let me know there was two other ladies that was going to help me! I walked around the building and there was two young women hard at work hooking up a trailer to a mans truck! After they finished one politely approach me and asked what I needed. I wanted a propane tank and have it filled! She grabbed the tank walked it out to the filling station and filled the tank up!  Very professional and courteous treatment by the young lady!<//review></record>

All I CAN SAY IS EXCELLENCE. The Customer Service is out of this world. I even had a truck that damaged some of my property because of a leak on the top and Uhaul handled this with such professionalism I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE...</review>

<Text>Was looking to fill 3 propane tanks. Their website says open til 10 pm
I arrived at 5:20 and rang bell for service, after unloading tanks and waiting 10 minutes I went to office and when asked "Can I help you" I said yes, need propane. The guy working said it will be just a few, the other person working is parking a couple trucks and will be right out. I waited another 10 minutes for someone to show up and was told they can't fill tanks after dark.
Waisted 20 minutes and got nothing. Be the last time I go there.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is horrible! They gave me a defective truck and took no responsibility for problems with the vehicle. Their inattention and poor service delayed my move by a day and ended up costing me a lot of money. Many of my items were damaged or destroyed and they just said to call their insurance company. Go elsewhere--avoid this place!< /review>

I went in yesterday with my mother had  a reservation and the worker were friendly and so jolly to the other Customer so when it got to me very low energy very little patience act like he didn’t know how to do his job he was an African-American but the other guy that they had in there from Bakersfield He was so professional so friendly and made the job so easy and made us feel very welcome but the younger guy that did it at first he needs to get his attitude together or not work there</Review>

** 24 July 2018 **
I just called for rates, I waiting 6-8 minutes before a female answered the phone. I was asked for detailed information on what I was doing and where. After mentioning that I only wanted prices and not a reservation, she explained that she needed all this information to generate prices. After I said to make it up, I'm only helping a friend, and that I could understand being denied a rental if my vehicle was determined unable to safely tow a car trailer,, I was placed on hold so she could get the price... another 6-8 minutes and someone else answered the phone. I explained that someone was working on a price for me, this girl went straight to the point and got me a price but explained that some days have different rates.
...
car dolly - $ 44 a day
car trailer - $ 54 a day
...
Since I was passing the area, 5-10 minutes later I stopped by to see how busy they were. 1 person on his cell at the corner of the showroom, no acknowledgement of my presence. 1 person in garage under a customer's vehicle, busy. 1 person in a rental truck, talking to customer somewhat unavailable ... no acknowledgement of my presence.
~~~~
if you have 20 minutes just to get a price, here's the place to call. Busy..? then don't waste your time..!!</text>

They extended it as many times as I needed no questions asked. When it came time to return it I had a family emergency and had to leave town before they opened. The Manager Mike was so helpful and understanding. He arranged to pick up the truck for me at no additional charge. He is amazing and goes above and beyond to accommodate their customers. That site is lucky to have him. Thank you Mike and the rest of the U-haul crew in Merced on MLK.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><text>The general manager, Mike is who helped us and he was awesome. The truck was ready and had all the stuff in it we needed, and he even quickly replaced a light on our tow dolly to keep us safe from paying for damage or tickets from cops. Great store, great employees, very clean and exceptionally well stocked with boxes and moving supplies. I've never seen a U-Haul store run this well in Kansas City where we're​ from. Thanks Mike!<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This is a very good company to rent from. We have used them twice now, and both times was easy, convienent, and a it was a fair price for the  mover we rented. They have many different size trucks and trailers available so I'm sure they will probably have one that will meet your needs as well. Let's face it moving is not fun, but using the moving truck makes it faster. Good luck with your move.</Review>

Easy to reserve a truck. However, we could not get the size we wanted for a local move. The $19 a day enclosed truck can not be rented locally, only for out of town rentals. We did not need a 15 foot truck and a pickup or van was not large enough. We did rent a 15 foot $29 a day truck because we did have to move some items and it seemed to be our only option. The trucks handle well. They have a dolly and packing blankets inside the back that you can choose to rent by cutting the plastic ties if you need those items. The dolly is very small though. The two items can be rented separate or you can get a discount by renting the dolly and six packing blankets while you have the truck.</Review>

<Text>I had a good opinion of this place but I have to say that the customer service associate was not pleasant to work with. I called this Uhaul to ask some questions about a rental and the lady there would not listen to what I to say. When I told her that she was not listening to me, that I some questions, she put me on hold for 20 minutes. Needless to say I called U-Haul Corporate this time and referred me to another location. Avoid this one!!! Bad Customer service.</Text>< username>

Poorly run on weekends..when you bring back your rental to return it takes someone 30 mins to come inspect it with 3 people working inside..if you don't have reservations and want to rent the uhaul truck for the day your out of luck the girl there won't rent you 1 they tell you they have nothing available when they have over 5 uhaul trucks there..< /text>

<Review>Yolanda Laurel is the best here. I’ve been coming here for the past four to five years and I will continue to come here because of the excellent services that she has provided not only for my but everyone I’ve recommended to come here. She is professional, and the rest of the staff here are abiding by COVID policies to ensure a trustworthy process. Definitely recommend coming here!< /Review>< pictures>

Had taxes done by Mrs. Pat Kinney I highly welcome her. She is very good, through, she explains everything to you so that you can understand. Which is awesome. She is also very personable and funny. She works hard to get you the most of your money as well as teach so you can be in a better position come next tax season. I recommend her to anyone and will continue to go to her. She is one of the best tax pros at Jackson Hewitt. You want your taxes done right and your money worth she is the one!!</Review>

He wasn’t paying attention to what I need help with and was laughing trying to joke around. He took his mask off while talking to me so he could “listen” better but he smelled like cigarettes which is very irresponsible and not right at all.

This is very poorly managed store. I came for my first shot of COVID vaccine.  After the checking I asked how long will be the wait? The lady at pharmacy keep telling few customers ahead of you. I keep asking how long is the wait and they can't even give an estimate. Also I see bad attitude in their face.  I have to wait for more than 1 hour for getting the shot. Amid tons of people waiting. (CoVid risk). If you can't honor the appointment don't give appointment.

This is a poorly managed store. Very poorly managed. Stay away.< /Text>

Sure, there's a line at the pharmacy sometimes, but if you look closer, the delays are caused by problems with prescriptions  and any number of things that are not the employee's fault.  I think the main problem with this location is low grade customers looking to bring the world down to the level of their own self-caused misery.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Came to pick up my daughters medication when the tech tells me there is nothing  I personally  dropped off the Rx. The tech just said get a new Rx (this can take days if not longer due to the holidays) meaning my daughter will be without her meds due their neglect. I spoke to the pharmacists "Abby" The pharmacists was rude and told me to come back tomorrow because she does not know and to have whatever pharmacists there help me. I ask what time and she responds any we are open 24hrs. I ask so then why can't she help me right there and then she just leaves to the back. So irresponsible and careless of the staff and especially from the pharmacists. What if these were life saving medications? What if this was you or your family member and you trust them with your prescs and medications?</Text>

<Text>I had to stop by 3 times to pickup a prescription for my baby that was supposed to be ready in 90 minutes
And each time I stop by they say it will be ready in the next 15 minutes.
I understand that it is a tough time and everyone is rushing to pickup his prescription that’s why I did give them extra time but still prescription not ready !
Very poor connection and customer service if there was less than one star I won’t hesitate</Text>< pictures>

Welcome to the corner of Happy and Healthy? Are you kidding me! More like I am at the corner of Sandpaper and Flagpole! I come in at 7:30pm to line 8 people deep. There are 7 people working. I was told to come back after 10pm. So I did to a line of 10  people deep! 2 people working. One guy working the drive thru and the pharmacist. Flu season is in full swing Walgreens! Schedule more staff! My suggestion is take your prescription elsewhere I have contacted there customer service numerous times and they still have not rectified the issue for the past 6 months.< /review>

<review>My dear friend Davis which is a new pharmacist. I fell in love with the energy that your heart has to offer for this business and organization. Everything that you do flourishes. You are very quick and very professional in your service to the people. But not only that what is special about you is that you are very important to this organization and I cannot believe that you are a new hire. Bless you and your family and generations after you my good friend. I am blessed to have you as a pharmacist at this Walgreens wife feel so comfortable going. Because your high impact and energy level is so high, of what you do to your customers as well as your co-workers and everything of what the company name represents. I am by far proud to put this review and bless the manager for hiring you. You are beyond amazing and I am lost of words because my heart is filled with joy and I hope that you stay there as long as I need you there thank you so much again mr. Davis< /review>< Pics>

My insurance insists that I use Walgreens- it is the worst for service and now they have actually lost a written prescription that I submitted myself.  The staff is ill trained and not helpful.  The waits are terribly long whether you call or stand in line.  I am so disappointed in this store<//text>

If I could give less I would.  They do nothing to help with patients.  They take at least 30 minutes to answer a call no matter what time of the day it is.  The lines are ridiculous and takes so long for drive thru or in store.  They have several employees but management needs to get it together< /Review>

<review>"Wait for 15-20min, we will call for you when it's ready". You wait in pain and fever for 50 min, get in the line again and it's suddenly ready! Why didn't you call me? And if I didn't get in the line again then what, I would wait for another hour? You try to be nice and not to disturb people with your question "Is it ready already?", but this timing is just too much especially for sick person.

<Review>If they don't have medicine in stock, they will LIE and tell you it will be in tomorrow, even if it been out of stock for a LONG time! Causing extended unnecessary pain and misery, where another pharmacy could have been used to get the medication sooner.

Also I have asked them REPEATEDLY for at least a decade to remove my home number from my account because I don't answer it anymore but they keep calling!

Many other things have upset me too, such as sometimes waiting over 20 minutes for each car I the drive thru. Sometimes I'm TRAPPED in the line for over an hour! They should change the drive-thru so people can leave if they want and not be TRAPPED!!!

I could go on and on about how much this pharmacy sucks, but you get the idea. :(</Review>< Pics>

<text>Honestly I just feel bad for the workers. The pharmacy department of this Walgreens is heavily understaffed.
I waited for at least 30 minutes to actually get started on getting a prescription. After that it took over 15 for the ONE staff member to complete the process.
The drive through medication pickup is backed up, and there are many people behind me in line.
Not the best way for me to spend my time on Christmas Eve.</text>< pics>

We were told that prescriptions would be ready in an hour and a half since we had five or six of them. That was when there were three people in the pharmacy. Apparently two left, ditching the last guy to do everything himself. It ended up taking an additional hour and a half to have them filled and it only got done that soon because I returned for them at the originally given hour and a half mark. If the pharmacist screws up because he feels rushed, guess who else gets screwed. The one who receives the incorrectly dosed meds. A pharmacist should never be stuck alone in a busy 24 hr pharmacy at 11pm when people need urgent meds that might save their life.< /Text>

< Review>
They have a 24 hour drive through. They are very good at adding checkout people when the lines are too long.

I am updating this review because I used to love this Walgreen but the pharmacy is not run well anymore. They now, too frequently run out of common medication and because of that, they turn off your autorefill so they don't keep getting notices. I continually had to remember to check for my meds which means I was out of meds A LOT. I moved to the CVS across the street and get 3months at a time. They have not been out of medication yet.<//Review>

If i could give it zero stars, i would. Or even a negative number. Dont ever go here. They make you wait, promising to call your name out, give you a specific time, afterwards they ignore you, forget about the time and not call you at all. To add insult to injury, when you approach them to ask about it, they make you queue once more. If you can, go to another pharmacy. The people here suck. We were late for our post op appointment because of this. People are in pain and they dont give a flying crap.</Review>

<Text>Called the pharmacy, waited on hold for 23 minutes. I was able to drive here before they answered. I waited 3min in the drive-thru before deciding to come in in person I stood at the counter and watch the phone ring and ring and ring. Then a woman by the name vi answered the phone. Here is the dialog: Me- hi, I am standing at the counter. Vi- what? Me-I am standing at the counter look to you right . Vi-im sry I don't understand. Me-im at the counter on your right. Vi- I'm sry there is no one here by that name. Me- miss I am standing at the counter I've been on hold so long I had time to drive here and walk in. I just wanted to see how long you would let the phone ring for. Vi- I'm sry there is no one here by that name....  vi was standing 10 feet from me. At this point I was talking to her over the counter. And watched here about to hang up the phone one me still completely unaware that I was 10 feet from her.  I don't know what to say. Not only did they let the phone ring for over 20 min with out answering....   I will update this if I see improvement and give current review again at that point.</Text></record>

I was calling the pharmacy and i was on hold for 15 minutes. Someone answered the phone and said they would be with me in a few minutes so I waited and tge phone started ringing and then hung up. I know I didn't press the button because I had my phone on speaker phone and I was putting dishes away. So I call back and the lady who answered it was extremely rude and gave me attitude. I am never coming back here again.</review>

I had one really bad experience, pharmacy clerk had stated I picked up medication, which I had not. So I ask to speak with supervisor and she showed me some paper with a date that I had picked up. I told them to contact authorities because I had not picked up medication.  what do you know they were so adamant about me picking up my meds and not giving them to me, that they hadn't notice it was a different year. So I hadn't nor anyone else picked up my meds. So next day after they reviewed there mistake I was given meds. No one even offered an apology. I no longer get that medication at Walgreens but CVS. You have to monitor stay on them calling falling up days before you need meds. Actually you are doing the pharmacy job all except filling the prescription this was last year and service has not changed. When does busy mean ok whatever I don't care wither you get your meds or not????

<review>1.) Waited on the phone for 20 mins for them to pick up and not answer.

2.) Decided to go to the actual store and they told me I didn't have a prescription for the medication I've been taking for years. They said they would have to send a request out, but they never followed up or called me to let me know if they had my prescription.

Basically they don't know how to do their job. Save yourself a headache and avoid going to this location by all means.<//review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service I was waiting for more than 2 weeks for my recipe and they never called me.
And when I called to ask or find me in the files.
That is, all the time I waited to register it was a waste of time 😡😡

(Original)
Muy mal servicio estuve esperando por más de 2 semanas por mi receta y nunca me llamaron .
Y cuando yo llamé para preguntar ni me encontran en los archivos.
O sea todo el tiempo que espere para registrarme fue perdida de tiempo 😡😡<//text>

John Gill is an expert repair person. He has worked on dozens of our university instruments: bass - alto - contra clarinets, basset horns, bassoon, contra bassoon, all the saxes, all the flutes, oboe / English horns - nothing phases him - even renaissance recorders. He's quick, professional, and his prices are a steal for the amount of expert knowledge and skill. I can't say enough good things about him and his store. If you care about your horn he's the technician to call.</review>

He said for me to get out of the store and it was so mean.
If you don’t want to be disappointed, don’t even come to this store.</Review><Date>1615427533284</Date><userid>117248551469957887405</userid></record></dataset><record>

I won't be back here. I was playing one of the guitars, and was told to stop playing because the owner was talking to a customer. I admit, it was a bit rude and did stop playing, but then it was like "if you're not going to buy" type of things, and it was a 5 minute limit on trying the guitars. So I tried another, but same thing happened within a minute so I left. This is why I go to my local Skips and Guitar Center where I do feel welcomed and there's no pressure in buying, play limit, have name brands, and have been around for decades.</text>

Took my clarinet in here to be completely overhauled.  John did a fantastic job with it.
I didn't realize that my instrument was as bad as it was until I  heard how beautifully it played after the repairs.

Will most deafinently  be bringing my Tenor Sax here for it's overhaul as well.  I also recommend him to others to get their instruments that need work call John.

I won't go anywhere else.< /Review>

The gentleman who runs this place is a terrific guy. Just really friendly and willing to help. It's a boutique shop, specializing in wood and wind mostly, I think. So I would call first to make sure they have the items or services you need (you won't find any Marshall Stacks in there). I needed help with some wiring on my active pups, and that's not really the kind of work he does here. But if he can't help you, he'll recommend someone who can. He recommended Arnie, over at Klines on Sutterville, and Arnie fixed the active EMG's on my electric guitar for $20.<//review>

<Time>1420086626279< /Time><review>I have had 2 saxophones totally restored by John and he keeps my other instruments in top working order as well.
With 45 years experience, he is by far the best instrument repair man I have found and probably the best woodwind and brass repairman in Northern California.  'If Branford Marsalis trust John to work on his instruments he must be doing something right.
It is hard for me to believe that he could have insulted some one. John is very laid back and is always in a cheerful mood.

Excellent service. I emailed them for a quote on a certain set of tires and within 5 minutes, Bart called with the quote and said the tires would be available by noon tomorrow. We had new tires on our truck by 3:00 the next day. It was a pleasure dealing with Bart. Highly recommended.</Review>

< Review>
HORRIBLE!! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. First, I take them a BRAND NEW car part (EGR valve) that my car needs immediately. They take it in that same day
and “fix” it. 2 days later MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES BACK ON!! I take it back and some man tells me “So it’s probably the car part that isn’t good” which is not true, they just don’t know how to do their job. They suggest that I buy a new part AGAIN and just take the other part back. So that’s exactly what I did today. I set an appointment for 2:00 PM just for me to come in and the man say “I’m too backed up today”!! BUT I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SO HOW DOES THAT WORK?! Not reliable whatsoever. I wouldn’t go. The only nice/cool people there are this blonde girl at the front desk and this man who checked my fuels. Other than that, everyone there looks at me like I’m crazy and don’t know what I’m talking about.</Review>

Wow!  What can I say. Picked up a bolt on 99 which resulted in a flat tire at 7am!!  Lucky for me, pulled in here and ran into Bret (who wasn’t supposed to be there, but lucky for me, was). I took off to work and he took care of my car.  He was quick to contact me and we ended up ordering 2 high performance tires, received and installed by 3 pm the same day!  Plus an alignment. The prices were more than fair, and the professionalism was top notch. They went above and beyond for me, and I’m pretty sure they would do it for anyone. Can’t recommend enough. Thank you!!</Text>

Nice to know there’s places out there that still give good customer service. Needed my spare put on, but didn’t have the lugs for it. They  found some and put it on ALL FREE of charge. The people working there all seamed happy. That’s also rare to see these days. Thank you so much for everything you did to help me.<//review>

Had the best experience there. I took my Honda Pilot today and had aliment done and it was great. They did a great job I got my tiers at Costco and they recommend to take my car there and also got a discount for being a Costco member there. Great customer service too.</Review>

I went everywhere in Turlock after I got a flat from being ran off the road, I was driving around on my donut with 4 kids. Balswicks was closing up shop when I hit there but Doug, helped my out and they mounted me a new tire!!!

They were so kind even though they were technically off for the night. I appreciated it so much and gestures like that are what make people become loyal customers!!< /Review>

I always go to this facility to get work done on my car. I am usually on a budget, so if I let them know my max spending, they ensure I get the work done for under my limit. I am so grateful for all they do for me.< /text>

Countryside Tire and 10 minute Lube have taken good care of my vehicles.  I have purchased several sets of tires through them and they have all lasted past the warranty.  I have had them perform service on my vehicles and have full confidence in them taking care of issues with my vehicles.<//text>

This is a TERRIBLE place. If you are a woman or an elderly person do NOT go here. They will rip you off. I took my car in for an oil change, and they are overpriced also used pliers to take off the drain plug during the oil change which screwed it up. My husband took it to the dealership and thats where he found out this had happened, we had to end up replacing the part so more money spent on our part. DO NOT GO HERE.< /text>

Asked for high milage oil before going on a 3,000 mile trip and when they put in regular oil and we asked for high milage the attendant told us they would not change it again and charged us for regular, saying that high milage makes no difference. Horrible costumer service.< /Review>

<Text>Let me start by saying that I work on cars and have extensive automotive knowledge. While on a two month road trip, we blew a brake caliper in Turlock, California. We stopped into Countryside and saw Bart... He started off very pleasant and was willing to patch our brake system for nearly $100 less than the "other guy", which happens to be his family member. Although his estimate turned out to be $50 less than the cost of the actual repairs, we said "go for it", because we needed to continue our journey. After sitting at a restaurant waiting for two and a half hours, he calls and says "I need to bleed your brakes, however we are probably going to break your two front calipers in the process and they will need to be replaced" (additional $760). We said "sure, but we want to be there to watch you do it". After watching his pretend mechanic "bleed" the brakes to no avail, Bart attempted to sell us nearly $1600 in parts. Thankfully, we knew what we were doing and drove to the nearest Walmart and bought a jack.... After driving 80miles with no brakes, we stopped at a friends house and proceeded to bled the brakes properly and everything works great. A message to Bart: the next time you try to screw someone out of thousands of dollars, you should take more time to consider the customers safety. If we would have been the average customer, we would have left there with $1300 in unnecessary parts. One more: go somewhere else.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Dirty milk tea simply tastes like...Vietnamese coffee since it has such a strong aroma and coffee taste that overpowered the milk tea taste.
Hokkaido milk tea is rather bland...
The popcorn chicken is quite unique and different from other places that offers it. Churros was cheap and great!< /Review>

<user_name>Sheryl D.< /user_name><Text>Stopped in to try their macarons & Their Pad Thai Noodles which was apparently a new menu item. They hadn't launched the Pad Thai Noodles yet.... So we tried the Garlic noodles which were good. Skipped the macarons because they were the size of a .50 cent piece and $2ea. I might go back to try some of their coffee options. I believe their teas and coffees are their signature items.<//Text>< Response>

<review>It took a little while, but it was definitely worth it. They use real matcha, not syrup, and the food was simple and delicious (and because of that, little sugar actually means little sugar since they’re not relying on a syrup for flavor *cough* tapex *cough*). Also as you can see, I got two keto items (the waffle and brown drink). Both were great and perfect for the daytime so that I don’t get any sugar crashes during work.</review></record></dataset><record>

We go here, especially for the Vietnamese coffee. However, their service is subpar. Got our pick up order wrong twice. First time, they forgot including an item. We noticed it missing after coming back home, called and asked for a refund for it. They want us to come pick up that one item. We placed an order today, specifically for coffee and then some popcorn chicken and others since we were picking up coffee anyway. When we reached the place on time, our order wasn't ready, and the girl working there said their machine broke and our coffee can not be made and to pick another cold tea instead. We didn't want that and asked to refund for the coffee. We're told she can't do that and to take something else. So, they can neither fulfill an order not refund the money. Did not want to argue much and ruin our day and got a matcha milk tea and pandan milk tea. Neither were any good. Everything else that we got are so salty, they're inedible. I'm almost about to quit going to this place ever again unless something changes.</text>

The service was good and friendly.  The Coco Taro slush and Avocado smoothie tasted good but didn't wow us.  The boba was slightly firm.  The macarons seem to have a buttercream filling.  Their baked goods near the cashier had no prices listed when I went.  I got the brown butter chocolate chip ($2.50) and it did taste good but seemed a little underdone.  I grabbed their ube blueberry scone ($3.00) and this just killed it for me.  This didn't taste good at all to me.  I tasted no ube or blueberry.  What I did taste was so overpowering.  It reminded me of the cooking spray smell when you spray it on to a pan, tray etc.  It was so overpowering and made the scone taste so far off to me.  The taste was hard to get out of my mouth and the coated feeling of oil lingered in my mouth.  I would not come back here after that incident.< /review>

Been twice now and the quality is spot on. The macarons are tasty and reasonably priced. If you sign up for their email list they send a ton of coupons. I even got a birthday freebie. I would recommend this little shop for a tasty treat.< /text>

Small shop with a variety of drinks and pastries. A friend took me her and I liked it. Next day I took my teenage son and he said it is whatever. It was my first time tasting macaroons and they were delicious.</review>

Ordered 2 drinks and popcorn chicken online. Got a response saying it would be 45 minutes! Drove there in <10 because i was near by and checked and the place was completely empty. I thought that time would be because they were busy, but they definitely weren't. Girl at the counter wasnt wearing a mask properly.<//text>

It's a cute small shop but most importantly the only boba place I know of that offers keto boba drinks! Everything tastes great as well. No complaints or issues! I'm a happy customer so far.< /Review>

Good selection of drinks. They even made us hot chocolate, even though it was not on the menu.  Macarons (both regular and ice cream) are delicious with lots of flavor options.  Their savory dishes make good snacks or light dinner.  The ambiance is bright & cheery with rainbow lighting, backlit walls. Perfect for date or game night or hanging out with friends.
I do wish they had more non-caffeinated drinks to choose from for their hot drink list.<//Review>

A boba place with ice cream, coffee, & some food options. I've gotten their "Churro Sunday" which is ice cream with a Churro & it's delicious. Their strawberry lavender milk tea is innovative and good! But their thai milk tea is one of the best I've ever tried! Recommend to get that one in your first visit. The boba is good. The ambience and store is nice! Have and will come here again.<//Review>

I discovered this place after relocating to the San Diego County area; even though I live in the North Costal region it's worth the trip. :) I drive specifically for the macarons. I have never found macarons that I like in SOCAL since I moved to the state years ago but I love these; wide variety of flavors, texture is great and nice size. I've tried cold tea here but nothing else yet but I plan to. Delicious place. 🤗💗👍< /text>

<Review>Definitely one of my favorite tea house. There’s never a line and it’s not too busy since it’s not in the main strip and plenty of parking. I like their milk tea options with the different milks. Their bobas are fresh and a good chewy, but not hard. Sign up for their email deals, you get free macaroons and a free drink on your birthday!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQPbnT-jM1Hv6xpAy8cfoRvUkdp782MqYCQ6hG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
It seems impossible to say but here it goes.... these are the best macarons ( NOT macaroons ) I have had in the states, PERIOD. perfectly chewy shell, a little salty a little sweet, theyre INCREDIBLE. I tried about 10 different flavors so far and I could never say enough amazing things about them to do them justice, TRY THEM! Better than "Honey and Butter", better than "Le Macaron" and slightly larger than Honey and Butter and way larger than Le Macaron! Pride and passion went into these perfect Macarons! Incredible selection of flavors as well!
Also the service was amazing. Above and beyond friendly and helpful. Hard to believe a place this 5 star still exists today! Thanks to the cute and sweet girls that helped us!
Their boba is very good, cooked properly, good flavor. Nice and chewy, not over cooked not undercooked. VERY GOOD! I ordered Honey Jasmin Green tea, it was not too sweet like so many other places.
Massive selection of teas, desserts, toppings, etc. They even have salted cheese foam which is super delicious!
I will drive to SD SPECIFICALLY to come to this place. Do yourself a favor and try this place!</Review>

If I could give a 10 star, I would. The selection of macarons was amazing. I had been on the search for Black sesame macarons for a long time and finally found someone who made them. I have been all over France and had some of the most amazing macarons and these definitely compare to those. I did a custom order for black sesame and taro for my wedding. The order process was super simple and I was able to pick it up on time. The bubble tea selection is also phenomenal.  I got the Pandan bubble tea and could not reccomend it more. The flavor is perfect and delicious. Thank you so much for making my order so flawlessly and tasty.</text>

I would look into this as I'm sure I'm not the only one getting ignored and due to the lack of service I was late to work.

Really love this place. I've been to maaany boba tea cafes, and Guiltea's are just the most tasty, sophisticated and least sugary.
My favorite are strawberry and matcha-cocoa teas (I think, that's the right name, matcha + coconut).
And their  (lavender macaroons!!) remind me of Europe. The staff is also the best.<//Review>

<text>Outside of Toulouse, France...this place has the best macaroons I've ever had.  The crust is always perfect, the buttercream filling is unique and flavorful without being overpowering.  The coffee selection however, could improve...machines aren't always working and they load too much ice, shorting you on drink volume.</text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Juliette Kelsey< /user_name><time>1606822884183< /time><rating>3< /rating><review>I came here around 2:30 today with my sister. It was pretty busy: there weren't enough seats for the people there. I got the strawberry hibiscus tea. It was good-- sour, which I like--, but they were a bit heavy on the ice. My sister got the berry mojito slush which I hated, but she liked. My sister and I got one of most of the macaroons there and most of the ones we got were very salty. The teen at the counter was kind of awkward and off-putting. Overall, it was okay. I was a little disappointed.

3 years later, even still this place is just okay. The macaroon ice cream sandwich wasn't bad, but the milk/powered teas were pretty awful. They had that soapy taste some teas get.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>This is one of the better boba places out there. There's a good menu with some food items. The service was good, and quick for the most part. I got a matcha frappe and it was made well...not too sweet but still had flavor. The boba was extremely soft and chewy, something that can be hard to find. I also got the crispy tofu, fried and lightly seasoned...pretty good for a snack.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Four of us went in. We all ordered different drinks. I was the only one who didn't throw my drink straight in the trash, and it was only because the tea was decent. The boba was weirdly bland and watery. Almost vomit-inducing. The dirty milk tea, fruity pebbles and almond matcha were all subpar. I like the Hokkaido but I wouldn't recommend it with boba. This was our second visit. The first time we came, they only had some sort of clear boba that was rock hard. So I would steer clear of this place.<//Text>

Great matcha coconut milk tea with white boba! The white boba is a little sweeter so we get 1/2 sweet on the drink. Best boba drink I've had so far in SD!

Service is excellent, macaroon ice cream sandwiches are amazing, and their fried tofu with all the different sauces is bomb!<//review>

The boba tastes great here! Other boba places need to step up. The macarons are the best though!</review>

<review>Good place to get your tea/milk tea cravings fulfilled. They have your standard drink "toppings", e.g., boba, small boba, pudding, etc...but they also have white boba which is a bit sweeter. They advertise their Thai tea as being "slow brewed", but I couldn't really taste a significant difference. They advertise that it's creamier, but to me it tasted smoother/silkier: as if they used milk as opposed to creamer. Not a bad thing - I liked it that way.

Also, one thing I enjoy about this place is their courtesy. All the times I have gotten a drink, upon receiving it they have told me, essentially, that if my drink isn't up to my standards to let them know and they will re-do my drink. Also their drinks are labeled like...I guess the best way to put it is like a Starbucks drink, i.e., you know and they know and any person will know what the drink is.

It's the little things that count.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

The owners appreciate their patrons, and everything was prepared very well. I ordered a Sashimi dish, and the fish was cut perfectly. The quality of the fish that they used was really fresh, and full of flavor. They also have imported beers from the Asian community that pack a really good punch. I ordered carry out twice, and dined in once. Each time that I ate what they produced, I was more than satisfied.</Review>

<text>Average sushi, fish looks like it's not very fresh. Slow time of day, yet the shrimp tempura was chilling already prepared. Cool and soggy, not a fan... The restauraunt flops on presentation, looks very unclean and the chef does not utilize sanitary practices. Food was overall okay, simple and not served with any sauces. Menu is very basic. Good for novice sushi consumers. No free edemame with dine-in.</text><GmapID>0x80dcac559e4a7d65:0xa90e3a494544331e< /GmapID>< Date>

Always friendly, they are a lovely couple. My friend and I have become regulars there pretty much and they have our orders memorized even if we call. Rolls are always fresh and I've never had an issue with their service dining in or taking out. Prices are really great too for the size of the rolls you get. Definitely reccommend</review>

Small Mom and Pop sushi joint, but they never disappoint. We tend to go for lunch. Never a wait for a table, rolls always come out quickly (yet properly and tasty). Not my go to for all-you-can-eat simply because they don't offer as many appetizers or the teriyaki chicken like other places.... but for Sushi by the roll I haven't found a better place yet.

I highly recommend the 38. Burrito Special Roll to anyone looking for something a little different. My go-to rolls also include the 29. B.S. II Roll, 50. Golden Tiger Roll, 47. Dragon Roll and 35. Crunch Roll. I've tried many others as well and all are great.

Also great for take out!!< /review>

<Text>By far the best sushi restaurant I’ve been to. I go very often and usually get the all you can eat buffet ($25 I think) or just the rainbow roll & crush roll. The crunch roll is better than anything I’ve ever tasted in my entire life. I do think they have some things they could improve on, however I am not complaining. When they give the drinks, they put the straws already in the drink which I think is illegal here now in California. Also, something I notice right away is while sitting at the sushi bar, the glass cover over the fish is very dirty. It looks like it hasn’t been wiped off in months with crumbs and oil all over it. This doesn’t bother me too much because I never sit at the bar, but if I did, it would gross me out. Anyway, 110% recommend this place and really feel like it’s underrated. Go!!!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

I am looking for a ramen place, Shoga is not it because there is only one type offered and that’s it. I did not eat the sushi. My soup was hot, spicy, and filled me up. Not much else to say. Service was one person and that was fine, it wasn’t busy at lunch hour on a Monday.<//Text>

Literally perfect sushi.  I had the tuna nigiri and had to order more when I was finished because it was so good. The rice was nice and sticky, not too sweet. The tuna was beautifully sliced and presented. A perfect ratio of fish to rice.  11/10 will be back!!<//review>

Only reason I’m giving this place 5 stars is because the food was good, price was decent and the older male employee was lovely. He greeted me as I came in and we conversed for a bit, the older lady however. Pretty rude, and rushed to take my order. Gave me a menu, and i kid you not, gave me 5 seconds to decide and even took my order wrong 😑 I was charged more than I was supposed to, but I didn’t mind. I work in hospitality, I understand if people have bad days but damn. Kinda got to me since I was being so nice to her, but oh well.</review>

Good food at a reasonable price. Not the best sushi I've had, but for what you get, the price is pretty good. If I want good sushi fast without paying a ton, I go here.<//Review>

The atmosphere is cozy, service was great and so where the rolls. We visited with my daughter and had several rolls from which some were baked. They were all delicious.  It's a great place to visit and enjoy great food.</Review>

The food was ok but not exceptional and the personnel was really rude and also racist!
The owner ran after our car in the parking lot, yelled at one on my friend because he forgot to sign the bill and called him "Chinese Boy". You can't behave that way with customer and can't even more call someone "Chinese Boy".

I'm not going to go there again. The behavior of the owner was simply unacceptable!</text>

Have tried a few sushi places in town but this is by far the best. Every thing is quality and their prices are reasonable.

I have really enjoyed the
Shrimp tempura hand roll
Crunch roll
Jessica roll
Crazy roll
For those shy of sushi they have great teriyaki!
Give them a try truly great and the owner is very nice also.< /review>

In addition to terrible service the sushi is bland and flavorless, rolls fall apart, avocado is aweful tasting and Thier crab is slimy and of poor quality... Up to par being a Colton business. The only redeeming quality of this place is that this place has is that you never have to wait, walk in and sit down.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Very average. Fish was ok. Lots of rice with the nigiri. Udon was too salty. Price was not quite worth the quality. But, hey, this is in Colton, so I suppose it is decent for the place.</Text>

I came in to a apply for the kitchen helper position that they'd posted on indeed. Then I'd seen they serve Ramen. I love Ramen. I can never get enough, just like my favorite Anime Naruto. So i had to try a bowl and it was delicious Thank you for the meal. Hope to see you soon.<//Text>

<Review>The food was badi ordered soft shell crab and it came burnt and greasy and then no way resembled a soft shell crab. We got a refill of iced tea and she charged me for two Iced Teas when I asked her to fix the bill and remove the shop sell crab and the other Ice-T she tried to give me 30% off for something I didn't even eat. And then proceeded to yell at me about wasting her money and when we were leaving threw an empty green tea can in our direction as we were walking out the door. I have never ever been treated like that this lady no wonder her freaking restaurant was empty<//Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Best in town for many years, always fresh and delicious. A light 'crust' with their cake and glazed varites that gives it that "Eller's" yummy texture.  The Cronuts are out of this world, and best Apple Fritters around.  Get a dozen donuts, crumb and jelly filled... they are old school, and Helm's DELICIOUS!!< /Review>< pictures>

Easily the best donuts in SB! Even though Eller’s is across town, I make my way there anytime I get a donut craving. Their donuts are the softest and freshest fried clouds of pure joy. I don’t know how they do it but their donuts the next day are still softer than other places’ fresh day of donuts.<//review>

Delicious donuts. Usually donut shops like this have the best glazed donuts and the other donuts are okay, but all of the donuts we bought were absolutely delicious.</Text>

<Text>Best spot forever. I get the box of day-olds for 5.50 and they are always amazing, soft and fresh.  I also save a few bucks. Ellers has made me into a donut snob, anything else tastes flat or dry in texture. The one on Milpas is better than the other location.  Recommend to anyone.. everyone...< /Text>< pictures>

Best doughnuts in this town or any place else. The other Ellers on upper State should not be allowed to use the same name. Seriously I'll probably have to get a couple stints cause I eat here pretty much daily.<//text>

< review>
this place is Amazing had great variety and the most delicious airy fluffy doughnuts. will definetly be our new go- to doughnut shop. the ladies behind the counter were so sweet and accomidating they special packaged my doughnuts so I'd be able to carry them easier with my 10 month old. Happy National Doughnut Day!< /review>

< review>
Terrible customer service. Short asian lady was rude when i picked a shirt i wanted to show her. She was like “put that back there i will get you one!” Without even saying please. After a while, she got me a medium size and then she started saying that there is no more large after i asked i want to try large as well when she came with the medium. I was pretty sure she did not want to go back there again searching for large, and it was there. Also, you cannot try shirts on. The asian dude and short girl did not help me at all in finding my right size. The taller asian dude who looked super high made me stand in line forever to check out when he could have easily checked me out on the second counter. They did that on purpose. The employees are not helpful at all and I saw them shouting at other customers to not take the clothes from the shelf! Would not recommend it at all; they also act as if they are a designer brand.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>These are amongst the best employees and staff members I have ever met. Not only did they helo me look for the bag I wanted but also assisted my 13 year old brother look for an expensive jacket that we ended up getting for his birthday. I never expected to quality of the customer service to be so good considering everything pretty much sells itself, but everyone was so helpful and recommended items I didn't even know about. This experience itself (my first time in LA) has made Aape one of my favorite brands in a split second.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>They treat their customers with no care, making them wait in long line outside of the store in the heat, when there are 4 people inside, to create false brand value and popularity.

Passed by on a Monday at 11:45 AM. Came from the supreme store next door. Looked inside the window and there were two people in the AAPE store. As I grab the door handle the "bouncer" stops me from entering and tells me to wait in line and points towards an empty spot next to the door. The doped up moron actually thinks I am going to start a line before lunch because there are two people in the store - hilarious! 💅✌️< /text>

<review>Had a great experience at Aape. The employees there were extremly friendly and actually had good attitudes unlike a lot of tithed stores on fairfax. Jordan was extremely helpful and walked me through the individual shirts and what was unique and different about each one. You can really tell Jordan not only helps customers, but he enjoys his job and likes making sure the customer is happy with what they’re buying.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I am visiting and my son and family member wanted to goto store Supreme next door and they were rude to us. We went next door to Aape after and it Very nice store lay out futuristic style, staff helping customers very funny and nice also. Register/manager was nice and recommended good food across the street. I also got free gift with my purchase so Thank you Aape By Bape staff!!!! 5 star. Good cute kid friendly graphics<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><text>I have always been a fan of Bape and Aape. I have been to their store worldwide: Hongkong, Singapore, Shanghai, Japan, and Thailand. Thus, my experience in this store is worse compared to other. I was going to buy approximately 8/9 pieces of their clothing, but then was disappointed because of their service. First, my sons were shouted at when they are goi ng to the fitting room to see how i fit in the clothes i tried. Second, my son was threatened to get out of the store when he was showing the employee the shirt he wanted. The employee sai that he must show him what he wanted, but isnt it what he did? The employee did not even give us enough attention. On top of all, my wife was not even allowed to use the restroom located near the fitting room by saying that it was employees only, but there was no sign that showed that the restroom was employees only. Instead, there was a sign of a man, woman, and disabled saying unisex. Its not like that we passby just to use the restroom. Service here is just the worse. I do not think that they are even worthy of a star. Nevertheless, I want to give a shout out to the employee waiting in front of the store for being a good sport.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I was very sad to leave my old Extra Space Storage facility on Meeker Ave in Richmond CA because Chris and Andre was so wonderful and kept the place immaculate.  When I need to return to renting storage space, they did not have a space the size I needed when I needed it so I went shopping.  I was able to stay with Extra Space Storage at a good price and was pleasantly surprised to find great service and a warm welcome from Monica.  The facility is also clean and feels safe.  As they say, all is well that ends well,.< /Review>

<Review>Went to several storage spaces today, I was blown back by how professional Lesea was. She had me in and out in a flash. She explained everything to me in detail and assured me that storing my things here would be the best option for my needs. So happy I came here and i would definitely recommend this place to any and everyone</Review>< userid>

I give 5 stars plus to her and this facility. I would definitely recommend this facility to people. The entire process is simple in office or online. Very satisfied with the service and experience here. Thanks Lisa.< /text>< Pics>

Lesea was so incredibly helpful and accommodating when it came to trying to get my trailer in the unit.  She went above and beyond and was extremely communicative throughout the entire process.  I was able to finally get my trailer in the unit and couldn't be more happy!  Thanks Lesea!!< /Text>

Let me tell you something dope about this spot. Not only are the staff super friendly and amazing ( Lisa ). The owner is absolutely wonderful and takes time to make you feel super at home so thank you Lisa.

Upon arrival we had the BLESSING of meeting ANDRE. He gave us an amazing tour of the extra CLEAN facility. We had an amazing time chatting about the Bay Area and if you are looking for a car lesson this guy is for you. Andre made this transaction 100 percent amazing and easy. Dudes got the illest personality. I’d work with this man any day of the week.

Definitely would love to recommend this place for sure. Easiest and most AFFORDABLE STORAGE spot for sure. Cheapest and best storage unit in the neighborhood for sure.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Unexpected circumstances forced us to find a storage unit quickly that was nice, clean, safe and affordable. Extra Space Storage was all that and more. I had read the  RAVE reviews about Lisa - who manages the place at 3500 San Pablo Dam - and chose based on that. And when we arrived, Lisa even exceeded those expectations. She helped us chose the right unit and executed everything quickly and competently. Most importantly, she was just so kind and nice. These things are important to me. We've been putting things in our new unit a few times now and the easy access by code is great. The freight elevator is a breeze and the place is carpeted, well lit, clean and just perfect. I cannot recommend this place enough.<//Text>< pictures>

My experience here was better then I expected.. I called other storage places close by and the customer service was below average👎🏽. When I spoke with Lisa she greeted me with a warm Pleasant voices, she listen to what I had to say .. was able to find the perfect unit for me much cheaper then any other company around🤑 .. I was excited and relieved how quick and helpful Lisa was in making this a over all pleasant experience.  I’m very grateful.👍🏽 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Service.<//review>

<username>Rachelle Germain<//username><text>If you need a storage unit I highly recommend Extra Space Storage. This is a very clean facility that provides excellent customer service. I was renting a storage unit yesterday evening and was having trouble with signing the lease electronically on my phone it was close to closing and traffic was bad getting to Elsobrante but Monica was kind enough to stay til I arrived. She had everything ready for me to sign showed me around the facility and my storage unit. It was quick and hassle free. Thank you Monica for all your help. I will definitely recommend Extra Space Storage to my family and friends.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Who knew renting a storage unit could be so unpleasant? Avoid at all costs. The management is awful. the only lift is often broken. The Rooms are all janky and not secure. Definitely found evidence of rats and saw some mold. The halls are constantly littered with trash.

oh yeah... it’s also heinously expensive</review>

Lesea was amazing! She took the time to walk me through the entire process: the online rental, gate codes, lock system, and the actual storage space use! She is friendly and knowledgeable, and takes pride in the property and keeping our belongings safe! I recommend this storage facility over other companies, for their personalized touch and commitment to customer service. Also, they have very good Covid safety precautions in place!!<//Text>

Great customer service! Monica was a joy to work with! I needed a storage unit for a few weeks and they were able to work with me and I got a unit for a great price! I'll definitely consider this place again if I ever need another storage unit.

Update: I closed my storage unit today and spoke with Lesea. She was so sweet and yet another pleasure to work with! This is still my go to place if I need a storage unit in the future!</text>

Both staff were really nice on the phone and on site. The process to have the storage, the key, the access, was fast and smooth. With a lot of explanation and walking together through the building. The building is sparkling clean, feels safe, and I have my mind at ease having my belongings stored over there.</review>

Lesea the store manager was super friendly and helpful when signing me up and the storage units are well maintained and clean.  If you compare prices with other storage places esp. as you get closer to Berkeley you will see this place has great deals per square foot. Close to I-80 so easy to get to.</review>

I needed a storage because I decided to move to a studio (went cheaper to pay all my deft off). When I got to Extra Space, I was in a stressed snappy mood. I snapped at the manager Lisa which was totally unwarranted. Lisa is so professional and nice. She talked me right out of my mood and took time with me to help me figure out what storage would work best for my belongings. Lisa is a great representation for ES. While I was there, a few people can in for various reasons and she treated everyone the same. ***On a side note, why was that crazy man on here talking trash about her. That sh*t is ridiculous. I bet he himself is an abuser***.< /text>

Update: After just a couple months, the dues for my monthly cost for my storage increased to the point of not saving me any money consolidating my other two storage units into this one.

ORIGINAL: Loved my experience here! Lesea(manager) was super friendly and helpful! Answered all my question and gave the perfect amount of information.

Loved her patience, witnessed new space tenant asking the most... *not so smart* question. She handled it perfectly!

I am relocating my belonging from other locations to this one which is a great deal and better price. Easy access and great space for moving, loading and unloading. The space is super clean and the location is perfect and easy access to the freeway! Thank you guys, give this woman a bonus. All that without a single sip of coffee yet.</review>

<Review>I met Lesea and she was wonderful very knowledgeable as we walked around she was always picking up anything on the ground which reflects how clean the property is. The units I saw were just as clean. The hours you can get in are the best around If you need storage this is the place for you.<//Review>< Date>

My experience with this company has been great! Brandon took great care of us and was fun to talk to. He made us feel welcome and answered all of our questions. I am very happy with the facilities. I really appreciate that Extra Space Storage allows you a free  truck to move all of your things into a storage unit. Public storage and other companies I visited didn't.<//review>

I have never in my life had such a easy fast and patient person help me in renting a storage unit. Juanita is so personable and genuinely pleasant no question was too much and after five of my calls I expected to wear on her nerves.. But no. She is wonderful to do business with.

<Review>Facility:  Clean, gate with code, no elevator for people but a lift for items going to 2nd floor, clean restroom available, access is from a busy street with a dip before driveway.  However there is a center turning lane so you won't be in traffic.  Low profile vehicles may and do scrape the street when exiting and entering the facility too quickly .  VERY CLEAN FACILITY.

Staff:  Friendly and very helpful. They take the time to answer your questions.  They do their best to meet your needs.<//Review>< Pictures>

Both the manager and the assistant manager were great! We called last minute, with a bunch of concerns, and a budget we had to stay under. Lesea helped us get a unit immediately. It was freshly painted but we couldn't come back later so she helped us deal with that issue as well. The facility is clean, gated, and the staff is great! Thanks for helping us last minute in the rain- you guys rock!<//Text>

Brandon and James were extremely kind and helpful, GREAT customer service. The unit is clean and I feel very  comfortable leaving my personal items here knowing they will be safe. It was also a quick and easy move, let alone the great price I got from the web special! I will definitely recommend other friends and Berkeley students to use this storage facility.</Text>

< Review>
I regret renting here! Lisa is the worst representative ever! I began renting early May with intention of only renting 2 months which I paid in advance.
I spoke with Lisa at the office twice informing her I would be arriving with a 20 foot U-Haul when I moved out instead of 15 trips with my truck when I moved in. Lisa agreed to move her car when I moved out as her vehicle blocks paying customers. Lisa informed me during our discussion that she is a physically abused woman with anger issues with history of being choked by someone and has recently been threatened by renting tenants at X-Tra Space Storage. On 6/12/19, I left voice mail at X-tra Storage office confirming I would be arriving to move out the next Saturday morning approximately 11 AM with a 20 foot U-Haul. I arrived approximately 11 AM as notified. Lisa was alone in the office and I went in to politely greet her. Lisa’s demeanor was cold and flippant,”May I help you.” After several previous face to face discussions, and that she was the live in property manager there for years,
I was shocked she played the ‘I have no idea who you are’ card. Courteously, I replied who i was and that arrived to move. “I didn’t know you were coming so soon,” Lisa snapped back a reply with hatred in her eyes and with tensed facial features. “Just go drive in!!!!”
After slowly driving the U-Haul truck through the front gate and around the building, I asked my wife to video our moving experience because we were moving away after living in the area since 1988. However, Lisa was driving out after my turn around the first building. My wife videoed Lisa in a fit of rage hollering at us from behind her car steering wheel and gesturing her hands violently at us. I am grateful I no longer will need to interact with property manager Lisa. My next negative experience will be recorded and police will be notified. Fair Warning. Lisa is the personification of unprofessionalism with a lack of common courtesy and self control. Whatever is bothering Lisa she needs professional help before she offends more customers. If needed, I will provide the video of Lisa in a fit of rage hollering at us while she was driving her vehicle which may be recorded on the premises camera as well. Don’t rent here. AVOID LISA. AVOID X-Tra Space Storage on San Pablo Dam Road in El Sobrante.
Or, she is a walking short fuse waiting to explode daily.< /Review>

<text>First thing is first. If you're in the area and need a place to store your stuff, come here first.

I lost my father and had very little time to move his belongs, including his classic car that didn't have an engine in it. I did really have time to plan anything and was super overwhelmed.

Lesea went above and beyond to help me not only get a spot for my dad's car but a spot that made the whole process so much easier. She set up a meeting with me to show me the spot, quickly get the paperwork done and recommended the best locks for my unit. She went over all the paperwork with me and made sure I understood everything and got me on my way.

I cannot thank her enough for all her help in this difficult time. And I cannot recommend her enough. Good customer service and willingness to help, what more could anyone ask for.

Lesea, if you're reading this, thank you.</text>< Date>

Lesea and Mathew who work in the office and run the facility were exceptionally welcoming, friendly, and very efficient at explaining everything thoroughly and answering all the questions I asked.
The moving process was quick and easy and they treated me as a family member. Lesea has a great sense of humor... she made me laugh so hard my stomach hurts :) and being moving is so stressful I really needed that laugh.
I am very happy with my new storage place (Extra Storage). They are quite spacious units and I'm very glad I didn't drive up the street to Public Storage. The Extra Storage facility in El Sobrante is extremely clean and the buildings look as if they're new or remodled.
You won't regret renting from Extra Space in El Sobrante. It was a great experience so far and I'm excited to start moving my things in.
Lastly, they gave me an unbeatable price which fits my budget and sealed the deal.</text>

Friendly, helpful and accommodating staff at this Extra Space Storage facility. Many units, excellent prices, secure and safe, but easily accessible for customers. Vehicle access makes it fast and easy to get in as a customer. Lift elevators for upper units.
This facility had everything I needed. You can't go wrong with choosing this facility! Thanks to Brandon for being incredibly helpful and accommodating with a situation that could have been stressful but was surprisingly easy.<//Review>

Leisa, the manager is phenomenal. She is very knowledgeable and has awesome customer service. You can tell she really cares about her customers as well as the property she manages. She always has a smile on her face. The property is always clean and I like the fact that I've never seen any garbage laying around.  The only bad thing I can say about this property is the code box to get out of the property on the lower half of the facility, is on the wrong side of the fence.<//Text>

<Review>I reserved the space online late night, came in the next day to see the space. I was met by Lesea, although she was having a rough day due to some technical problems with the computer she met me with a smile! She showed me the unit and the grounds is kept very clean! The unit space was perfect for my needs! She went through the leasing paper work with me and I can tell the really try to work with people! I got half off my first month and my monthly payment is reasonable for the space! I highly recommend< /Review>< Pics>

They have gone beyond my expectations by helping me with my personal storage unit but also my business need for a storage unit. Lesea (Manager)  has been very helpful and and has gone beyond her job duties to be there for me. I always feel welcome and would highly recommend anyone to use this storage facility even tough they have competition all around them. I now have 2 units and can not be any happier. Even during the epidemic they spoke to me and explain the issues we had. Great service Lesea goes beyond her duties to help.<//review>

She was very kind and shared all the information I needed to know,  with me that I needed and then when I brought my family member in to set up the storage agreement, she was not only kind but patient in explaining each step of the process. Great customer service.
Now a year later we need to downsize and again Lesea provided the same assistance and walked the property to show me what my options were available to make the right selection. Funny thing but important: as we walked she picked up trash that had blown in from the streets. It’s always clean here and she washes the units down before a move in. Whenever you visit you’re likely to see her walking around with a broom. She cares about keeping things clean. If you get to see this post I want to say thank you for your kindness, patience, help and I appreciate the consistency of service and cleanliness! Important attributes to have when dealing with people and their personal belongings.</Review>< Pictures>

If you are needing storage this is the place to go. Lesea the manager will help your with all your storage needs. I can't believe how clean it is here and Lesea let me know how safe it is here oh and I can't forget the great hours till 10. If you need storage go see Lesea. Thanks for the easy process in and out.< /review>

<review>I reserved a unit on line. Brandon called the very next day to verify and left a very professional message. When I finally made in to the office to finalize things Lesea greeted me with a smile and made me very comfortable. She remained professional and friendly the entire visit. I am glad I selected this facility.</review>< response>

I've had storage units in other locations and other businesses. By far the best one is in this location. Not only it's super super clean (which is a plus) but the the Manager Lesea Benitez is so nice. She's very professional and courteous. Such a lovely lady, always happy and smiling. Got my unit today and to be honest I've never had such a pleasant time getting a unit in other places. Lesea you're the best!< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Went to public storage for a price check, and she was horrible. Didn't want to give me any info on units. So I went down the street to extra space. And man ol man. The difference is day and night. Lesea ( Lisa just spelled differently) is amazing. She found Me the perfect unit and I got a great deal. First month half off. Great employee at a great company. Will definitely recommend in the future.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8085778566f36f53:0x7b59c070ba6d0527</gmap_id></record>

Being a self storage facility owner-operator past & present..., all I can say is "what an extraordinary facility, excellent operations detail & personable first-class site manager --- can't ask for more".< /Text>

<date>1499318146129< /date><Review>I was greatly impressed by the assistance I received from lesea benitez. I found her to be uncommonly professional and personable.  I left the facility satisfied and felt as though I had a potential new friend. We talked about things having nothing to do with business. She was bright, friendly and charming. I can't remember the last time I left a business with such a good feeling.   I hope that leseas superiors are aware of her rare and unique qualities and that she is desexedly rewarded.  She was the one bright spot in a day that had been fairly awful and I thank her for that.< /Review><name>Robert Vakulich</name><Gmap_id>0x8085778566f36f53:0x7b59c070ba6d0527< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Went in today to get a unit and the manager Lesea Benitez was amazing.
She went above and beyond.
Lesea showed me around and I was amazed on how clean the place was.
Don't think twice when you are looking for a storage. Come here!!!
Thank you Lesea :)<//Review>

Lesea at the storage in El Sobrante was so kind and helpful with setting up storage in Tacoma, WA.  She went out of her way to contact Sven at the Tacoma WA storage, who was also very helpful, to make sure my needs were met.  Thank both of you for going out of your way to help me.</review>

<text>Update to prior review:

To be fair I will say that this is my 2nd time using extra space storage at this location specifically, because the location is convenient, easy to manage, and has OnSite management. My first experience was good. Not many complaints except the office hours should be extended at least until 7pm for the people that work a 9-5 or 9-6pm shift.

This brings me to my current experience: Lesea the store manager was helpful and nice the first day I moved into storage 11/12/2016. So much so that she gave me some furniture coverings that she personally had with no charge. I gave her a review with 5 stars that day. Since then however her customer service has gone out the door! She is rude and short on the phone (opposite of face to face service). She doesn't practice "active listening" but rather argue back and forth until you let her have the last word. I've been behind on a few payments and simply called in to make an arrangement to bring things up to date. I explained I can make it in today  by closing at 6pm. Lesea yelled continuously that she has a surgery and will be going out of town, and that I need to be there by 5:45 in order to be helped. I explained that I'll be traveling from Antioch and will call by 5:45pm when I arrive nearby. Lesea argued for a good 3-5 minutes that I am not hearing her clearly and that she will not help me after 5:45 because she has to go out of town. (Sounds like a personal matter) If your store hours are until 6pm why would you refuse service 15minutes before. I'm out done with the way she has  handled things lately. It's always personal with her, as if she owns the company or location. I will be moving my things out sooner than later. All I want to do is make a payment and sign paperwork. This entire situation could have been avoided if she would've kept it Professional and about the customer, but she made it personal. Baffled! Will not recommend!< /text>< pics>

Lesea was amazing, I was moving my belongings from Southern California to El Sobrante and she did everything she could to accommodate us. She waited for us even after the office was closed and the company allowed us to do paperwork at another location before arriving to El Sobrante. I have never had such great customer service. I was originally going to rent from Public Storage but they were not flexible with us at all and we found Extra Space and we are happy we did. Thank you Lesea!</text>

Omg Lesea Benitez was so Amazing. We came in a total mess and she was patient and very very understanding off my family situation. She made it so much easier to deal with our sudden move. We was able to store all of our things and we feel safe that our thing our in Extra Space Storage. I always look forward to seeing her everytime I have to go to my storage unit. She make sure that every thing is clean and the storage doors are clean and free of spider webs and dust. Love her to pecies!</review>
