My pedicure is super easy I skip the massage I only want my toes clean and pretty..,, this was not the case today sadly perhaps because my guy was off. They didn’t even want to attempt to do my nails they told me to wait until he’s in after first telling me he was on his way....I spent an hour waiting for him to come but he never showed and then they said he had car trouble.., I’d give them less stars if it weren’t for my previous visits< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Worst nail salon I have ever been to! They were rude and pushy about trying to add other services that I didn’t want. Instead of using a colored acrylic powder, they used gel which I didn’t want and they came out so sloppy and I woke up the next morning with the gel already peeling off.<//Review>

<Review>I love them, they make me feel like family. I have been going there for the last 4 years and I have tried other shops and I always come back disappointed that I even attempted to go to someone else. Aaron is the best and I will never let anyone else do my nails besides Nail Design Studio! He can do any and every style you present to him and he always has all the new stuff so he keeps me up-to-date!<//Review>< pics>

One of the only 2 I go to

I'm usually very happy going here.
You do have to know which staff are good for what though. Some are intense, some very gentle...
My feet come out perfectly every time except once....
There's only one who I would avoid because she seems angry at me and it shows in her effort or lack thereof....
She's done a half hearted job every time, toes once, hands twice. She treated my friend so poorly for wanting an inexpensive gel color change instead of a gel manicure, that my friend left crying without getting the work done.
But the rest are the BEST< /review>

Experience was the worst I ever had, I call before I wanted in to make an appointment the owner told me he is not taking appointment today, they are only doing walks in and I should come know, I got there in 20 min. Sat down do get my feet done and a gel polish on my hands. Will getting my feet done the lady that doing my feet was hurting me , so I told her stop your hurting me that I will wait for someone else, she told me next time I should tell she I wait for someone else, I couldn’t believe this lady of what she was telling me . So I waited for a good 20 min. Before someone else came over to finish what the First Lady was doing . When she was done with my feet she said sorry but we can’t do your  finger nail because we are all booked, I said what you mean the own told me coming in because you all are only talking walk in and I am not going to have two Different nail polish on my hand on my toe I called when you guys said you just doing walkins. Worst experience I have ever had I had to leave that nail salon been trying to find another nail salon that will take me to get a pedicure in a manicure with the same nail polish I left that salon didn’t get my toes painted I paid $25 I had to go to another nail salon and end up paying an extra $40 to get boat nails done same color wise experience.</review>

So I've been going to nail studio design for seven years now and I've always loved their designs and how they did my nails but 3 weeks ago I went and I had the older gentleman do my nails. first off my nails were perfect when I went in and then I got the full set with gel colored and I left out of there with about four of my nails crooked and uneven then a week later I had to get my nails  redid but I was out of town so I went to a different nail shop and they took all my nails off well on my left hand my middle finger restarting turn white so the lady told me to keep an eye out on it well 2 days ago my entire nail came off it is completely fungal and it's disgusting and I called them and they wont do anything about it so for now on I am never going to this place again and be careful getting your nails done because you might get a fungal like I did.< /review>

Getting a pedicure is a must. I am not sure about having gel in the water for +$10. The manicurist tried on several occasions to upsell me.</text>

<Review>This is MY nail shop. Any time I get my nails done elsewhere I am disappointed. I've never been disappointed with the way they do my nails or pedicures here. They are very friendly and make clients feel at home. Most people who come here are long time regulars such as myself. Go to Erin for designs, go to vinn for quick fixes and fills. He is a perfectionist and does everything so quickly. Go to tom for pedicure. He is the truth!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Horrible customer service ! Not a place to go if you want to relax . They rushed my pedicure she had my whole pedicure in 5 minutes. Tried to get my nails done and let the lady know how I felt about my pedicure she told me to pay and leave. I'll never go there again. Let me not forget how rude they were, I was trying to have a mommy daughter time and they completely ruined it and told me to leave with my nails half way done.< /Review>

<review>Worse nail place ive ever been to! Ive been getting my nails done for over 20yrs never felt so ripped off! First time i went the older gentleman did an awesome job. 2nd time i went for a acrylic fill i was so annoyed. What kind of nail place only fills ur two toned acrylic nails half way??? I said i want to keep the same color jus fill in the pink AND THE GLITTER! What does this young kid do? Cuts half of my glitter tip off fills in the pink amd calls that a fill!?! Then when i call him on in he and this other guy argue with me about what i asked to b done. R u foreal? Ur arguing wit the customer instead of fixing the issue! What they did to my nails was no fill it was a cheap rip off. On top of that when i first got there these two ladies who were getting pedicures walked out cuz they were using dirty untensils n got caught. These place is dirty, unprofessional, need to learn English n not rip there customers off!!!!< /review><rating>2</rating><Gmap_id>0x8085731ba7c4e7ff:0x84800d06b606a187</Gmap_id>< resp>

<text>Great service.  Everyone was polite.  Came in April 5th. The barista Tristen was amazing. He was the only barista I've had in LA ask me if I wanted my shot shaken with my cold brew. This is where most baristas mess up because I need my drinks shaken!!
Way to go! Thanks for my coffee!< /text><user_name>Marissa Taylor< /user_name>< Date>

< Review>
Every time I come in here either they forget to start my breakfast sandwich or they give the person who ordered after me their drink before me.....

Today the customer who ordered after me got their drink before me. I asked the barista “is a drink for McKenzie was coming out?”

It was literally sitting right on the side ready.... there was also a really big block of ice so I feel like the care wasn’t placed into my beverage.

You know things happen, nothing personal against anyone working here. Everyone has a great attitude, Gabby is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Amazing. But this is my absolute least favorite starbucks to go to :/ I always have an issue like listed above.

Friendliness is awesome and I appreciate everyone’s good attitude but I really just go to Starbucks to get my drink quickly, in the order it was received. It seems there is an issue consistently with organization and communication.</Review>

This location finally allowed me to use the bathroom after I bought a 6.00 Frap! Sad. Customers come first. We eat as humans and use the restroom. Period. Where are we supposed to go to the restroom on a road trip!!! Covid cleaning may be a good idea by the staff!!! Gloves and Bleach!!! Karen rant!!!< /Text>

The sweetest team of baristas, it almost feels like they're a coffee shop from a movie or TV show because they are so friendly and remember their customers and no matter how busy they are will make a point of it to smile and give you their undivided attention!

< Review>
Good place for a Starbucks!  Jorge, Danny, Vikki, Monica, and some names I don't know..!  In the afternoon to closing it can be packed with a diverse crowd of people!  As with the new society, Starbucks have a high tolerance of what happens in the store.  Things as dogs, transients, unattended toddlers causes public health issues by touching items inappropriately.

This Starbucks is one of the best in the South Bay area.

It has become a haven for transients and rats!  customer service is bad, but public health and public safety is worse...  It is inevitable for something tragic to happen and it is unfortunate since the big Starbucks company doesn't care and hiring/training system is for a unique culture of kids!<//Review>

As with most Starbucks it was clean, service was fast, drinks were made right and thats about all you expect from Starbucks.   I have never used thier in store web so cant talk to that and normally dont get their overpriced pastry.<//Text>

One of my favorite restaurants of all times, I've been going for years. Our waitress, Marcella, was amazing yesterday. The food is so incredibly delicious and the atmosphere is fun and trendy. The owners are some of the nicest people I've ever met and the recipes are created in house and are absolutely fantastic- and I always check out the taco of the month!</text>

This Starbucks in the Rolling Hills plaza makes the community look like a dump!  Some workers don't have any idea of what they are doing!  Socializing comes before service! People bring pets and let it sit on the table... If you're their friends, you get free drinks and conversation while paying people wait.  Not one black person has ever work at this Starbucks on 25348 Crenshaw! And the behavior displays their #RACIST attitude.  Most of the staff are gay!  Smells like pee..
Terrible place....  They need to close it down.<//review>

Sometimes there is no place to sit, but easy to see why!  Good selection and stock on edibles.  Bathrooms clean the 2 times I have 'visited'.  Seating are is all tables, no bar style seating for individuals.  I hope corporate gives them a remodel that allows for more seating.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

If you order a berry berry hibiscus, try it with peach infusion, your mouth will be amazed. Try ordering a berry berry hibiscus with peach and fusion with no ice and no added water and leave it in your refrigerator till cold and youll have an even more wowed taste.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures><text>On the corner of Sepulveda and Crenshaw boulevards, and next door to one of the five high schools in Torrance and the Southern California Regional Occupational Center (SCROC - A public trade tech school), this it's a very busy store.

At times very busy with long lines and waits, while the staff pours on the efficiency to pump out orders in a timely manner.

There's not a lot of seating, all of it along one wall, but there are ample power sources for devices to charge.< /text>< Date>

Very tiny and crammed up. there is not much room to sit since there is always people on their computers. No outdoor seating area and not even much room to stand to wait for your drink. Service quality is average. Parking lot shared  with a lot of other shops</Review>

It's a Starbucks... There are only two tables with outlets, and a few others have wireless charging pads... You need a charging ring which are available to borrow (located at the tables that have the outlets)</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The staff came out to receive the order and we waited outside and thanked the female staff for being so nice and eagerly praying that everything returned to normal as soon as possible so that other staff could work too. Starbucks Fighting !!!!

(Original)
직원이 밖에나와서 주문을 받고 우리는 밖에서 기다렸다 여직원이 친절하게 잘해줘서 고마웠고 하루빨리 모든게 정상으로 돌아가 다른직원들도 일할수 있기를 간절히 기도드리련다 스타벅스 화이팅 !!!!< /Review>

They were helpful over the phone when I had questions. When it was time to pick up photos, my son had a pleasant experience with them. Photos and frame were packaged nicely. Photos all looked great! My son has some acne and retouching was well done. We are happy with the photos.<//Review>

Extremely overpriced, photo quality is poor. Save your money and go to an independent photographer for your child's senior photos. You'll be much happier with the outcome.</Review>

My sons pictures were terrible. I thought since he was going to be photograph by a professional, the professional will help him attain the most flattering poses. The back ground was too dark and the angle of the pictures were low. This were going to be his high school senior pictures, his year book pictures. Since I'm not going to purchase any of this photos my son will not be in the year book. 2020 will be a year we will all remember.</review>

My experience in the store was great. They had good attendance like any other photo studio would, except the prices are out of budget for many families. It's as if you get charged for breathing in there. This would be amazing if the prices were realistic. I cant get a variety without spending big money. Since when is a photo worth more than a family plan phone bill.</review>

First sitting for daughter was a disaster, the photographer didn't even notice her hair was askew and face shiny --any decent photographer would notice and ask the subject to fix the stray hairs and powder nose lightly!  At least studio is doing a redo.   Then there is the cost which is outlandish for what you get!  Get your yearbook photo done at minimal cost (THAT does cost, which is wrong), and check around and get cap and gown or other portraits done elsewhere more reasonably< /Text>

My experience here was great. I was attended right away, the photographer was very kind and charismatic, and the studio appeared clean and professional. However, albeit the great service, I resent this place for its ridiculous pricing. I understand that money needs to be made, but it is absolutely unfair and out right insane to charge the amount they do. If your student has the option of choosing a different studio (our school requires our photos are taken here AND PAY or else we won't be in the year book) then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you choose elsewhere that fits your budget because a low income family, such as mine, will not be able to enjoy this precious memento without feeling the costly burden.</Text>

<Review>The person taking the pictures was very nice but the prices are way to high. I would never have gone here if my school didn't require it. Getting the pictures taken is way over priced and printing them is even worse! It's the same thing as with the College Board, they know there is no way around using their services so they raise the price way up and take advantage of a bunch of high school kids. There's a reason they only have 3 stars</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

This place has good service, and kind photographers, but it is OVERPRICED! For my senior portraits and prom day it is impossible to get an array of beautiful pictures without spending more than 70$ for excessive amounts of the same pose. Their packages are overpriced for multiple copies of 1 pose. You're better off hiring someone for a cheaper price with many pictures to choose from< /Review>

It's almost impossible for families to get memorable pictures without spending a lot of money for a single pose. I was charges 80$ just for them to take pictures for me to be in the yearbook, ontop of that I had to pay at least 50 to get one pose multiple times majority being a small size.<//review>

The process of getting my daughter's senior portraits taken went from frustrating to infuriating.  First of all, they are drastically marking up the price for senior portraits.  The lowest package costs $120 and that only includes one 8x10, two 5x7s, and eight wallets.   Of course, there is also a sitting fee, which means with tax you are going to pay almost $200 for the lowest package, with no touch-ups or extras.  The most expensive package with the sitting fee with set you back over $400.  You would think for all that money you would get amazing service, but even when I made an appointment I had to wait 20 minutes just to check in with someone and then another 40 minutes in a really crowded room for her actual appointment.  The sitting itself, which included a $50 sitting fee, was less than thirty minutes.  It might not be so appalling if the studio was not serving children in public schools whose parents probably can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars on photographs.  I still haven't been able to bring myself to actually buy the photographs because the price hiking is so troubling I'm actually considering taking it up with the school district.</Text>

<Review>Extremely expensive, they don't take good shots...There are no cheap packages... Even the cheapest one is expensive. And just like another reviewer said, even professional photos can be cheaper now with the technology, but at this studios, they know you have NO option but to use them and they squeeze you out of every extra option... It's an American made rip-off!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>First they ask $43 to take pictures, then they want $53 more to actually print your pictures. This is insane. They don’t even allow you to print them yourself. All the pictures have water marks until you pay them for the package. This is FRAUD. I have to idea why schools are still working with them.</review>< pictures>

Horrible.  Rude on the phone, expensive (1)8x11 $50, forced to purchase unnecessary sizes in package just so they could price it high and we consumers have no choice bc it's a school photos.  Schools should choose better deals with these studios unless they're the ones pocketing the cut.</Text>

They charge you insane prices twice. First payment is just to take pictures that you can’t use if you won’t pay them even more. This is fraud. Scamming students just because for some reason schools still work with this awful studio.<//Review>

<Text>We Just want to say thank you to Jason & Briana, They were very helpful in selling our home in La Verne. They staged the house beautifully. They were very detailed about the little matters that helped to sell the home. Any time we had a question they were always available to answer our questions. They advertised the home on line which made it easier to sell. We would gladly recommend them to our friends or family whom might want to sell or buy a home.<//Text>< user>

I’ve been working with these people for some 20 years across various insurance policies.   Last night, I tried to get onto the Mercury website and download some needed docs.  Had some problems with the website.  Sent a message to CSIA, and by early this a.m. Greg Barber had already sent me the needed docs.  This is the A+ level of service that has kept me a customer for this long.< /Text>

I appreciate how they listen to a given situation and address it immediately and are compassionate about their customers.  We have been a loyal customer for over 20 years. They are also very competitive in the marketplace, and we have both Auto & Home policies with them as a result.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dce9d92e9ac281:0xf08db55f790d6e04</GmapID></record>

My agent Greg Barber is honest, very professional, quick to respond and very informative about which auto insurance company is best for me and my family.  He also recommended I make changes to other insurance I have to save me money without sacrificing much in out of pocket money should I have a claim.  I would highly recommend him or anyone else at this agency.  I am considering a Term Life Insurance policy and will only look to Greg Barber at California Southwestern Insurance Agency to provide me with sound advice and all the options available.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dce9d92e9ac281:0xf08db55f790d6e04<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

In the digital age, it's easy to lose sight of the importance of a customer relationship. I was pleasantly surprised when I first started using this agency because they would take the time to call me periodically with updates and information that is important to me. It made me feel like they really are looking out for me.</Review>

We have been working with Greg Barber for over 20 years, and now our grown children also use him for all of their insurance needs. Greg is always quick to return phone calls or follow up on any issues and is proactive in making sure our insurance needs are adequately met. He is also a very personable and honest agent and I would recommend him to anyone seeking insurance or other financial help.

<text>I have been a member of California Southwestern Insurance Agency for over five years now and my only regret is that I didn't switch my insurance over to them sooner.  In conversation I think we speak about our insurance agent much like our tax advisor, our mechanic, or even our doctor.  This is a relationship built on trust, and for good reason.  I have built a relationship with my representative,  Onya Patopoff, over the years as she has always delivered world class customer service and advised me with my insurance needs with the ebb and flow of my life,  whether I changed vehicles, or recently have gotten married and am now adding vehicles and our home owner's insurance.  I always know I don't have to call into some 800 number and get transferred several times before winding up in someone's voice mail.  But also, I can run my personal scenarios past Onya, and she gives me good honest feedback on what programs are going to be great for me, yet also mentions several other programs that might be better from a coverage perspective- I get great advice and don't have to worry about someone trying to sell me something I don't need.  At California Southwestern Insurance there is a personal touch that you just can't get with other big companies.</text>< gmap_id>

I went to this school from kindergarten through 4th grade. I don't know where to start. The amount of homework given at this school is ridiculous. The amount of time to eat compared to the amount of time to sit around and hangout on freetime is just sad. Give this a thumbs up if you don't like this school.< /Review>

<text>What an exquisite facility. I base my entire life off of the ten core values and everything I do revolves around them. My knowledge of the founding fathers of our beautiful and simply exquisite country has increased dramatically since arriving here. I've learned many useful skills that I am sure I can apply later in life like 2 years of Latin (a very useful language that is spoken often if you live in the 5th century) or knowledge of what Joan of Arc's middle name was or the number of acres George Washington owned. I also simply love being able to choose between three whole outfits to wear each day which consist of a very comfortable collared polo shirts and stylish slacks. Highly recommend this school to everyone if they also want to become a Latin speaking classical learner.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Don't listen to the hating kids' reviews, they couldn't even spell "torcher" right. John Adams isn't perfect, but it's a great school. The environment is friendly and respectful, bullying never happens and it's easy to make friends with the other scholars and teachers. The classical education is also a plus, and the scheduling is great for high school, makes the workload easier to manage. Not a bad school overall, though lacking in a place to play, like a real grass area, unlike the other JAA school in Lincoln and El Dorado. As a scholar here, I'd recommend it!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This school requires a 40 hour a year volunteer commitment per family, which really helps bring in strong families.  My children are receiving a great education.  We love the 10 core values they teach the students.  They are taught them everyday.  We appreciate the patriotism our children are learning.  And one thing we notice compared to our public school is the way they tackle problems and issues in a quick and well thought manner.

<Text>John Adams Academy is a fantastic school! The idea that a child can receive a high quality liberal arts classical education at a tuition free public charter is an educational game changer.

The school board is experienced, principled, and in touch with the day to day operations of the school. They, along with administration, are always seeking to improve the quality of education offered to the scholars.

Like any school, John Adams Academy has challenges unique to its location, demographics, institutional type, and educational philosophy. However, on the whole, everyone from the facilities crew to the school board are dedicated to providing the best education possible to as many scholars as possible. It is not uncommon for administration, teachers, and support staff to volunteer extra unpaid hours, supplies, or resources to improve the overall educational atmosphere of the school.

I highly recommend John Adams Academy.< /Text><Name>Tim Gervais</Name>< rating>

The classical education provided is ideal. However, their growth is making it difficult to maintain the values they hope to instill.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Overall my family has been happy with the education and experience our children have received as JAA scholars. We’ve been with the school since it opened and have witnessed many challenges and successes. I struggled at first making the move as I wasn’t sure how my kids would respond to the transition from a public school to a charter, but I am very happy with the results. The classical education experience has been challenging, but has rewarded my kids with a well rounded approach to learning and thinking. The foundation of servant leadership and ten core values have helped guide choices and actions and given the scholars a high ceiling to strive for.

We’ve loved the different instructors and mentors the kids have had spent time with. The teachers are extremely hard working and many of them highly qualified in their respective subjects. Overall we’ve enjoyed the open communication with the staff and administrators. We spend a good amount of time volunteering and taking an active role at the school, which has allowed us see first hand how much the folks we’ve been involved with love and enjoy our kids.<//Review>< pics>

Most of those who posted a bad review did so because of their lack of willingness to learn and to do their work. It is a tough school, and there is lots of reading and annotating of primary sources but the main reason that it is a good school is because the teachers and curriculum are there to get you to think. The books I have read and the discussions I have had in class are far more advanced then anything my friends at other public schools are reading. In order to get the best grades, you have to be able to show that you can think, not just that you can memorize. As with any school there are minor problems, but the drama level is surprisingly low, and the people are quite friendly. It is a good choice of school: the people who have the best experiences here are the ones who are willing to learn, and do their work.</review>< pictures>

The school feels like a boot camp to be honest, the teacher are great but the schedule was not thought through. They give you more time to play at recess then to eat. And let me tell you mostly all of the kids at the school are sexual and not well behaved. Weirdly it is most of the very religious kids. Which this school has a lot of.< /text>

Student since the first year here! I have attended the school since fourth grade. I am now a Senior. I can honestly say that I love this school. The teachers are amazing (with a few exceptions, as with any school). They are honestly great people and take the time to get to know you personally. They will stop and ask how you are doing in the halls, make sure you don't need help on homework, and genuinely want to learn from the scholars as well as teach. The staff is friendly and helpful, and most of the scholars are nice and studious (we don't have bullying problems or much swearing because the majority of scholars are religious [LDS and Catholic are the two big ones]) Sadly, the administration is not as good, having a tendency toward unpreparedness and inconsistency. This is probably not the school for you if you don't enjoy a rigorous education. There are often philosophical discussions, debates, and socratic discussions, even in classes such as math and science. We don't have a great sports program unfortunately. However,  we have great music and art program and plenty of things to do if you are interested in debate, philosophy and a classic education. I highly recommend checking out the library.</Review>

This year's administration is by far the worst it has ever been in the school's seven-year history. They show favoritism and bias among students. Inadequate communication with parents. They promote a culture of violence instead of greatness. They favor the bully than those that are bullied. Administration does not believe an actual punch in the face is a threat, but just saying you will is worthy of 2 days suspension  Careful about putting your kids in here< /review>

I'm disappointed in the amount of school work given on holidays. Instead of spending time with your family, the kids will be caught up in school work.  Caution! putting your kids in this school will take away from important family time. Time we can never get back. If your value you're time with family, DON'T PUT YOUR KIDS HERE<//Text>

This school literally sucks. It appears to be all good, to the adults(why its has high rating on facebook) but in reality...... To the students its almost like a boot camp.... It really sucks.

First of all it, it really depends on the teacher you get. JAA is not right for everyone. They have a unique teaching style that may not be right for everyone. And I saw a review that said there are to many Mormons, and from experience I can tell you that alot Mormons who go to public schools get bullied because they have different standards. Also the uniform, they have a uniform for 1:students don't get bullied because of their style 2:so students do not get categorized on the clothes they wear 3:so scholars learn to express themselves through the arts. This school is still young, I have been here from the start, so why not give it a try?< /text>

Teachers here are pretty excellent except that they always give the kids tardiness when it's not their fault.  Sometimes kids walk in the room and get a tardy and mabye detention for being late.... is this really fair or reasonable.  At least give the kids more time to get to school or find out where they live site people can understand the time it takes to get there... all in all it is pretty dumb and harsh.< /text>

< review>
​This being my first year at John Adams, I have learned more than any public school has ever offered me. I have learned to appreciate the gift of education more than before and I have learned beautiful life skills that will allow me success in the future. John Adams has encouraged me to reach for the stars, but not to even stop there. The staff works individually with each Scholar, taking personal time out of their day to invest in us and help us succeed. They have devoted an entire hour in our school day for scholars to seek help from our teachers.
The Staff's goal is always to ensure that their Scholars are excelling and being equipped with tools that allow us to assist ourselves when our time comes to face the real world. They take time to get to know us, so us Scholars don't feel like we're walking into a cold learning environment.
JAA Staff have politely pushed me and challenged me to excel and challenge myself, both academically and personally. ​I've grown academically, with raising test scores, and I have grown personally, developing a deeper respect for myself and those around me.
John Adams has been nothing but an inspiration and support to me, opening doors of new opportunity and advancement.
So thank you John Adams Academy, for providing such a beautiful learning environment that I can thrive and grow in.</review>

< Review>
My first visit was great, second.... Terrible. I was early for my appointment and wasn't helped out until after 36 min. They were not ready for me, didn't even bother to look at my medical record, Dr. And assistant calling me by another name, kept trying to make it seem like they new my medical history and Everytime were wrong. Then waited another 32 min (would have been more if I don't go asking for a manager) for the Dr to come in and make awkward small talk and once again assume I'm someone else and to tell me exactly what I knew and told them on my first visit. If you're going to have policies in regards to canceling or being late to appointments, I suggest you give the same treatment to your customers. It's only fair you respect our time as we do yours.<//Review>

WOW! What an amazing experience. I went in for dental whitening and was really unsure what to expect and a bit nervous, until I met May, she was so wonderful! She explained the process and was so patient, I didn’t feel like I was being rushed to get out of the door she took her time and made sure I got the best care. Also the results of the treatment were amazing! Dr. B was great, he came in and checked on me throughout the whitening process. I will be going in again in a few days to get more dental work done. Never thought I’d enjoy a dental visit this much!</text>

Absolutely recommend this place I come here for my regular dental check ups. Dr. B is the very best he’s always making sure that you’re good while he provides treatment. The staff is extremely nice and always welcoming. I also receive my braces treatment here and I would 10/10 recommend to others.</Text>

Today return with my son for his orthodontist appointment which supposed to be done on last Saturday at 4:00 pm if I didn't get the mishap txt message from the office indicated an appointment at 4:30pm. I showed the receptionists the two txt messages and wanted them to know that my son wasn't late to the last Saturday appt because we followed the time we received from their office. Instead of the receptionists apologizing for their mistake, they blamed it on the system made an error.  Also, one of the receptionist said my son showed up at 5:30pm when the office closed at 5 pm on Saturday. FYI, my son and my husband said they actually showed up at 4:25pm and was sent home with the 4pm appointment for today, Monday 24th.  These receptionists are very unprofessional.  I hope this review will help them improve better customer service.< /review>

Too bad I can’t cancel my ortho contract that im paying cash.  This will be the 3rd mishap with this office and only been with them since August.  Arrived to my appt this morning to find out it was rescheduled without my knowledge!  Poor work ethic and inconsiderate to say the least.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The worst place, the worst, I do not recommend them, they only care about your money, my sister continues to pay a permanent crown, which only lasted 3 months and continues to pay the cost is 1300 but she no longer has the crown, they had to keep it because the work did not It was done and in this place they do not want to return your money or put a new one. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE

(Original)
Malisimo lugar el peor no se los recomiendo solo les importa su dinero mi hermana sigue pagando una corona Permanente que solo le duro 3 meses y sigue pagando  el costo es de 1300 pero ya no tiene la corona se la tubieron que quietar por que el travajo no estuvo vien echo y en este lugar no le quieren regresar su dinero o poner una nueva NO RECOMIENDO ESTE LUGAR<//Text>

I will never ever go back there. I dont mind the wait. After sting listening to the worst music playing and super loud. Finally got to our turn I had my son sit down.i was asked what I wanted and I just said a trim. She refused to cut my sons har because he is mixed and has curly hair and it was too much combing.... you get paid to cut hair your just too lazy< /review>

WHAT A TERRIBLE PLACE TO GET A HAIRCUT AND MANICURE
THE PEOLE ARE RUDE AND THEY ARE DEMANDING CLIENTS TO GIVE THEM TIPS
TO THE OWNER OF THIS SALON
TIPS ARE OPTIONAL AND IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO TIP YOUR EMPLOYEES TRAIN THEM ON HOW TO HAVE QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE
THIS PLACE ITS A SHAME 👎👎</review>

<text>Everyone one was nice, but I think more learning is needed!! Went in for layers but ended up CHOPPED !!! Probably the worst cut I've ever had! I'm sorry, but I had to give this review the low rating I gave because I cried when I got home. Gotta buy hair clip ins to fix it until my hair grows back, and thank God my hair is a fast grower!!!!!!!<//text>< pics>

<review>This is the best Med shop in the state! Hands down!! Best price with the best customer service!</review></record>
</dataset><record>
<name>Jose Rubio</name><Review>I went a week a go and I liked this place because the prices are reasonable and, a great variety and good customer service. I went today and they ask me for a recommendation now because they just went medical only and no longer for recreational.
The recommendation would cost me $39 and would take 15 minutes to complete the process on site through my phone. It was a deal breaker until the manager Jenny handled this very professional and said that she would give me a discount towards my purchase that would help offset my expenses on the recommendation. Their customer service was so good and the offer was very reasonable that an 15 extra minutes was not to much to ask and I couldn't refuse . Just based on the  Courteous employees with great customer service and not to mention the offer by Jeny the manger you cant lose. I would definitely come back again.</Review>< Pics>

Since remodeling about end of 2018 they providing a shity and shady businesses, the lady in there took a picture of my driver license without my permission or asking with her tablet. When I asked her for the reason she changed the subject. Something is so wrong in there I feel it and it’s going to burst sooner or later</Text>

<text>Very poor customer service. When I called to get a few details about available products, the person who answered was very impatient with me and ended up pretty much hanging up on me when he suggested I  just come to see what they have and I told him I wanted to make sure they have what I need before driving over there. Anyway, JUST NO! I will spend my money somewhere that my business is appreciated and where I am treated with at least a small shred of respect.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Asked if I could return/ exchange a cartridge I had purchased and not only was I able to exchange it for a better/ newer one, the manager, Jenny, helped me with the exact one I wanted and on top of that, she threw in a free pre roll on the side. This place goes above and beyond to help out their customers.< /Text>

Been to this shop many times. The staff has always been courteous, helpful, and knowledgeable working with pain. They even helped me work on post surgical pain. Ambience reminiscent of a 70's head shop.< /review>

Got some super glue and it held me together. I liked that the prices displayed includes the tax. The amount for the tax is outrageous 😁. I hope the revenues collected are put to good use.<//text>

<Review>Picked out $45 worth of stuff but somehow was charged $84. Didn't  occur to me until I was driving home. Then was told that I can buy a vape battery for the cbd/thc cartridges at any gas station. That wasn't the case. Wasted $20 at two stations before I found what I needed at a smoke shop. Difficulty was due to the screw on portion of the cartridge. Doesn't seem to know their stuff. Especially after being told that their edibles are strong, yet I plowed through a brownie and cookie with no problem. Still gonna shop there since they're the closest shop, but I still don't like them.</Review><response>None<//response>< rate>

Been going here since I first had a scary emergency with my car making strange noises that nobody could figure out.

Not only did they figure it out and fix it for free, they have done reliable and absolutely amazing work for me over the years following. I wouldn’t go anywhere else even for an oil change, they’ve changed a timing belt, removed a nail and sealed my tire, and they always stand behind their work. Which they should because it’s definitely something to be proud of, the family is reliable and definitely people you’d want to get to know!! Funny, clever, and just so sweet they’ll rot your teeth!

I recommend them to anyone in passing conversations about car issues, I wish every car shop was held to the standard they’re at.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I flew out from Florida and purchases a used RV. It needed a good going over before I started back home and I received a good recommendation about FOX from a parts store. The RV needed about four days worth of work and I was treated extremely well while there. I felt great about not only their work and fair prices but also their sincere concern for getting the job done right so I could make the 3000 mile trip home. They were really great. I'm so glad I ended up there. They're really great!</Review>< pictures>

Randy, John, Carlos, and all the rest are by far the coolest most reasonable cats in the industry, hands down. Randy explains the process step by step and his knowledge and expertise go a long way in our community. I would never take my vehicle anywhere else unless they referred me. Outstanding work gentlemen! Thank you!!< /Text>

<Text>Several family members and friends also have gone here for years.  We recommend it for their honesty and good work. Like most repair shops, it doesn't have a lot of parking, but they are great about getting your car in when you need it. Randy is the store owner and works to give you a good price without suggesting unneeded work.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I came in for a smog. I thought it would be pretty straightforward but I had a check engine light so I guess I fail it automatically. They checked out the light and it was for a gas cap (seriously, the gas cap...) they had the parts on hand and took care of it right away. It was about an hour total and they charged very little for the gas cap. It was a great deal. I brought the guys some tacos from next door and they were really appreciative of them. Thanks Randy and Fox Tire!< /Review><response>None</response>< user_id>

< Review>
Took 4 weeks and didn't do a good job. Car left worse then when it came in Volkswagen fixed everything they couldn't. They also could never give me a straight answer and weren't listening to my problems. Only interested in money. Don't recommend this place. Car got engine light that they supposedly fixed 3 weeks after it left shop. Outcome of this whole experience was they did a bad job and had to replace engine.</Review>

I was treated like family!  Was able to get a great used car which has served me well over many months.  The car has been maintained well by Fox Tire & Auto and continues to be reliable.  Manager and employees have all been supportive.  I will continue to take my car there for maintenance.< /text>

< review>
I burnt out a relay in my fuse box and it turned out I had to open up the whole fuse box to replace it which I had no idea how to do, I was running out of time on a Monday and had to be at work the next day.  So against all my instincts I had it towed to Fox, which I just found randomly on an internet search.  The owner Randy, I think? He was awesome, he ended up getting me the part within minutes and his brother repaired it for me in about an hour I drove my truck to work the next morning.  They gave me a really great price which I wasn't expecting because I was in a bind.  They treated me really well and if I ever get stuck on another repair I will definitely go back.  I definitely recommend this place.  Thank you guys!</review>

*Edit: I didn’t realize dogs actually aren’t allowed at this park. I saw the sign after I went back. Very sad because it was perfect for him!*

Very cute hidden park. I was dog sitting a pup who doesn’t get along with other dogs so I needed to find a small secluded park. This one was perfect! We were the only ones there on a Sunday too! Everything was pretty clean, except for some food trash that people decided not to clean up after themselves. Please keep the parks clean! :)</Text>

Nice park in residential community. You do not see it from the main street.  In fact there is no sign showing park from main street. The park is completely fenced.  We entered thru the small gate in front.  Several slopes for walking up and down.  Also picnic tables located in different places.  Sandy playground with 2 swings for older kids and 2 for younger kids. No slides but a climbing area with bars and rope.  Stairs to walk across from side to side of the covered structure.  Have monkey bars in large circle formation and a very small zip line.  The zip line has no way for the kids to enter onto it.  You have to hold them up to reach the bar every time they want to use it.  (Only negative about the equipment). Great place to walk around and saw couple of older residences walking their dogs.  The residents can enter thru 2 other entrances from their streets and there is a water fountain. Grounds were very well maintained. No covered picnic area and no baseball field or basketball court. Nice park for the residential area and my 7 yr old great niece did enjoy playing there for about 2.5 hrs.</Review>

<username>gene silver<//username><text>Great neighbors.  Everyone wants into Cherry Cove...but not everyone has the money, although it's a steal of a price...still too high for a lot of folks.  But, like some areas, there are a few homes that owners refuse to improve.  These are the ones to find and buy if you are a first time buyer.  We've lived here since 1987 and still love our home.  Lakewood is a great community with many parks, including Cherry Cove Park.  Great place to raise a family.<//text>< gmap_id>

I love how this park is kind of hidden, but it's so big and so clean tucked away in a neighborhood. They have a fun playground, large picnic space, and huge running area.<//text>

<review>The kids really enjoyed it. There are a lot of different trampolines and trampoline games for kids and adults to enjoy. There is also a rock climbing wall that it somewhat challenging. Unlike other Skyzones, this one didn't enforce the rules in open trampolines and people were jumping in zones that were already occupied. It was really dangerous for younger lids. Beware!!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX9rj2F3K7CyrRG3qeLnBobG5DTwIz90syDkWl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJNJUK1l7o1VkwdtorBGUC3EirEDMxzMEf9wPo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c3280c3091bfbd:0x7f77c90379f26521<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fun place for the kiddos to burn off their never ending energy. About $30 per jumper but they had lots of fun.<//text>

The kids had a great time.  Right when they started to get tired and needed a break, it was time to move into the party room.  One day after the party and the kids are begging to go again.< /Review>

<Text>Usually a fun and safe place for kids. Some times they can do better on monitoring kids that are being unkind occasionally, especially when it’s super crowded. But overall, my kids have a great time when they go for parties or just for fun in the summer!< /Text><time>1575910442684<//time>< rate>

Kids love this place and it's great for athletic, semi-athletic, or couch potato adults.  Food, lockers, and game zone available.  Also available for parties.</Text>

I've been here. Any times with my kids and even had my son's  Birthday Celebration here. This last time I noticed they added some new attractions wich in all honesty they are not great at all. They shrunk the jumping significantly.  Now only about 10 kids can jump per time. The worse part was when I went to order 2 orders of nachos.  The kids they working there are so bad what they do. It took them 15min before they helped me at the register. I ordered 2 nachos and it took them 25 min to open a bag of chips and place the chips on the plate. Then, it took another 15 min for the girl that realize the nacho cheese machine needed cheese sauce replaced.  When she brought the cheese sauce bag she asked another employee how to install the cheese sauce. It took another 18 mins for them to install the bag. Keep in mind in between all this the teen employees kept going to the back and giggling and joking around.  I finally asked for a supervisor.  He came in. I asked for my refund. The supervisors name is Alex i think. Not helpful whatsoever.  They need to hire people with good skills not unsupervised teens.< /Text>

They will nickel and dime you though especially for their own socks. We went for "Toddler Time" cost per kid doesn't include socks >:O. On top of that we went with completely adequate trampoline jumping socks but from another trampoline park company. Kids were not able to jump in those socks, instead they required us to purchase their own branded socks which was half the cost of admission....

<review>Very standard trampoline park... the foam pit was to small... needs more arcade things to relax or do before or after jumping...they should let people know in advance when a section is closed for a private party... I went because of the dodgeball and the area was closed... had glow in the dark night so at least that was a plus.   They need to expand or add some kind of activity...</review><Gmap_id>0x80c3280c3091bfbd:0x7f77c90379f26521<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I liked this place, but on the weekend we had my daughter's birthday here and her friend got 28 dollars stolen from her purse. The staff told the kids to take their phones with them, but to leave their bags or other valuables in the box (giving them the impression that this was the safe thing to do). While it was our party's time to jump, the money was stolen. I really got a strong vibe from the staff that they were guilty. They acted really nervous when we were asking them questions about the situation. Just be careful and don't leave your valuables in that box. Only leave things like your shoes or a sweater. Nothing else.< /text>< username>

It was actually really fun.... But pracically everything we were doing was "against the rules". While we were just jumping and minding our buisness. The guy at front counter was super sweet though. He greeted us kindly.< /text>

Came here for a party. Fun place for kids (5+) and adults. Not a place for little ones because lots of kids running and being a bit rough. The foam blocks do have a very bad smell. Other wise good place to spend at least 2 hours at.</review>

I've always had a soft spot for trampolines but the older I get the less able I am to enjoy this sport for more than 10 minutes. Today is until I went to Sky Zone and played trampolines dodge ball. I suddenly got a second wind and jumped around for another 30 minutes as time stopped as I tried to physically destroy my opponents. More fun, or sweat, can not be had on under an hour for so cheap. You need to get here. Now.<//text>

When people are paying hourly to jump around and only where there was light better it start to be pretty tight for the kids<//review>< Response>

Lots of fun. If you arent physically fit don't expect this to be for you. Bring lots of energy and wear comfortable clothes and you'll be In for an entertaining night.  Execellent to keep kids healthy or get them into shape.  Good for anyone who wants to be healthier.
But take it slow if you arent sure about what your body can handle.   When you realize you are swweating buckets dont forget its supposed to be fun.  Smile and enjoy watching everyone improve their coordination and strengthen their muscles ligaments and tendons.< /Review>

Kids had a great time jumping. I was disappointed that I couldn't use the Groupon that I had purchased the same day, so ended up paying full price. Snack bar prices are comparable to movie theater snack prices.< /text>

To many rules. Your only allowed to jump in one square at a time,and the construction isn't helping.It gets overly crowded,and your stuck in the same spot, not good My kids hated it. They start yelling at you to stop jumping a certain way or if another kid jumps in your square they start yelling at you. I don't recommend this place at all. Try Rockin Jump. It's much better</Review>

What a dump. Dirty, dirty and just plain dirty.  In addition the staff closes the snack bar to have breaks. Understood staff needs a break yet to just close up with no coverage is unacceptable!!  Spoke with manager and she did not care. Sent an email to corporate and they did not care. So since non cared I’m caring enough to write the review<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><text>Overall my experience was great my kids loved the camp glow on Saturdays  from 6-11pm. Was a bit dissapointed that you had to purchase either a glow shirt for 6.50 or a white plain shirt for 5  in order to participate. The reason for my 4 star rating is party space. We were sitting in the cafe tables and a young lady arrives taking all the tables and chairs for her party. They kept bumping into my chair and almost dropped the food I had in my hands. I know this is not the facilities fault but they should look into building more rooms for parties to avoid situations like the one I went through. Not only for the parties guests but respect for other paying customers.</text><user_id>115323050332872464182< /user_id>< gmap_id>

It’s not organized at all. We were kept waiting for over an hour and nobody would help you...if you really want to come here, definitely avoid weekends cuz the staff is not able to accommodate big parties. Btw the manager Jason in the evening we were here wasn’t helpful  at all. He told us he was going to give us shirts and socks, and then just disappeared....horrible experience!<//Review>

The experience was definitely one that I'm glad I was able to have. A lot of things felt sticky from sweat, but with such a big facility and so little staff, I can forgive them for not being able to keep the entire place spotless. Overall, I'd recommend going at least once. But I probably won't be coming back.< /Text>

My son had a birthday party last Sunday
I don't believe I saw our party host smile once. I don't think she once addressed the birthday boy or even said anything fun to anyone. I felt on edge all the time. I felt the rush inside the party room....it was eat eat eat...finish finish finish....then quickly do the cake and goodbye. The party host turned the TV on inside the party room.......If I wanted to entertain my guests with  TV I could do that at home....
I paid $520 for the party and when my son and some of the boys were thirsty before we went to the party room we had to buy bottled water because no one would give us any kind of water, even tap water.
In my opinion the place was fun but the service sucked. I would recommend the place for fun but not for birthday parties. $500 was too much for the kind of service that we got, and I have done at least 15 birthday parties for my kids in various places.<//Text>

It was a lot of fun. There were a ton of kids everywhere so I would recommend going during school hours if you want to do more tricks, and to avoid little kid throw up... which happened.</Review>

Place was fun for kids. They make you buy socks then they don’t let you exchange size even though you did not put them on. They run small. It was crowded with a area closed that they could of opened. Also not enough seating for parents.<//Text>

I purchased through groupon and invited friends to join us. It was so hard to get in. They acted like i wanted to come in for free. They wanted to search my email for time and date purchase. They gave my friends a hard time and would not allow them to use there groupon either. It was a mess and super stressful. Never again the other sky zones are so much easier to work with.<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I just wanted to warn others who may make the same mistake we did!...We bought a Groupon for this place and showed up, but were informed you can't use a Groupon that you purchased the same day you plan to use it.  When you come with a group of kids ready for fun, and are turned away, it is very frustrating. I wasn't willing to pay double the amount to get the kids in for their asking price.  The teenagers working the counter said that it was Groupon's policy, but I have used same-day Groupons many times. So this is Sky Zone's policy. In fairness, it was listed in the fine print, which I read, but didn't catch this detail. There was a lot of fine print. Disappointing affair overall.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>OMG!!! This was a really cool place to have friends, family, kids, etc.!!! Me and my friends celebrated a birthday party this morning and it was awesome!!! The staff was nice, the trampolines, rock climbing stations, even dodge ball, and foam pits were all so much fun!!! :D

Also, I would recommend leaving your phone in one of the cubbies or party rooms because I had lost my phone that same day and I had to come back before they closed to find it. :(

Fortunately, the manager, Jason and all of his employees were so nice and even kind enough to help me successfully find my phone and I went home happy! :]

These guys surely aim to please and make the environment as comfortable, inviting, and entertaining as they can!!! I really have no reason to give these people a bad rating!!! ^-^</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
I made the grave error of going to Sky Zone Covina. When you go, they make you sign a waiver, and they email you a copy. And then they put you on the email marketing list. And then they spam you.
You may click on the unsubscribe button, which I did on seven separate occasions.
You may call them and talk to them asking them to stop, which I did on three separate occasions.
You may explain to them on Facebook and Twitter and on Sky Zone's corporate page that spam is ILLEGAL and please for the love of god make it stop.
But they will keep. spamming. you.
There is no end to it.
Do you want to receive emails for the rest of your natural life about GLOW NIGHT and how they're DIFFERENT AFTER DARK?
How about after you die - do you want your estate to receive emails then?
Then go to their place, and sign that waiver.<//review>

<Review>No capacity, and a lot of older kids jump. Coworkers talk a lot to each other a lot at times, and kids are left unattended.  Don't get me wrong, it's raining, and it's Sunday which makes it a great place to bring the kids.. You just have to pay close attention if you don't want them to get hurt.

BUT!! When you see dogs here, definitely caused me to grab my stuff and leave! Sensitive people can't leave their rodents at home where they belong.. Even some staff looked over at it bothered, yet didn't say anything....</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c3280c3091bfbd:0x7f77c90379f26521<//Gmap_id><username>Jimmy Deering< /username>< Date>

Worst place to celebrate a kids birthday party. My kids always like to come play at this location & wanted to give a try to the Glow VIP package to celebrate their birthday party with school friends & family.... well that was the worst experience for everyone. Starting from the manager everyone there is just there to do the minimum to get their pay check & they dont care about people (they dont even know what customer service means) all they want is collect your money & thats it.
We get there at 5pm since our Birthday jumping time supposed to start at 6 pm. Well as soon as i step into the counter, i was not even greet by their staff but sure thing the first action they wanted was for me to swipe my credit card to proceed with full payment (not even polite enough to ask if i have favor bags or cake to bring down into the park), they changed the final price emailed to me for $200 dollars more. The check in was a total mess because their staff was not even prepared to receive 40 "jumpers" as they call your guests, nothing explained to my guests & they just did what they wanted, My kids friends wanted different color shirts & they gave them one color to all of them & different color to the birthday kid, staff always very unpolite, rude & useless. On the different areas two of my guest were taken out because their time was over but since they gave us 4 different stickers for each 30 minutes of jumping of course the stickers were falling off the shirts & didnt care about asking they just wanted to have those kid stop jumping. Now the time to use the Birthday room guest what? You have 40 minutes, 20 for eating & 20 for the cake, they even have a timer & they are just checking the last second on the clock to kick you out. Btw in the middle of it the staff pulled me over because i needed to pay 18 dollars for an extra guest, instead of waiting for me to finish the celebration they went inside to grab me & pay the damn 18 dollars. In few words this was the worst experience & place we had celebrated a party for my kids. Ownership really needs to take care of their place & employees since no one there is mature or experienced enough to handle such place. In fact the place is getting ruined due to the lack of experienced staff, you can start seeing the poor maintenance to the location, how dirty the common tables & chairs are as well started smelling bad overall areas too. Really sad but true, this place doesnt look nothing close to when it was brand new opened. Please do a favor to yourself "Dont ever celebrate a birthday party there, not wort it".</Review>

<Text>Truthfully I wish I would have read some of the reviews before I booked my sons 16th Birthday here. I feel robbed. Upon arrival our party was not treated like VIP and the staff acted as if we weren't expected. When we got there I expected to be taken to a party room only to find out that we had to jump for an hour and then we'd get a room for 40 min. When I reserved the space I was led to believe we'd have a private room for 2 hours. When the time came to get the room we expected to eat FRESH pizza.  The pizza looked as if it were ordered the day before and it was stale and cold. Shortly after we messed over the pizza, the cake was given and before the cake was eaten we were told we had to leave. We were rushed out of the room.  I've contacted manager and have not received a call back. I will now call corporate.  Please note that party included 1hour of jump time, glow shirts, socks, 3pizzas, 3pitchers of drink, and 40 minutes in the room, cheesy decorations, cake plates and cups.  After totaling what it would have cost alacarte I realized I was robbed. I asked manager what I was paying for while I was at the venue and he said, "the skyzone experience."  In my opinion there was no experience at all because we were treated like walk ins with no reservation for a party and that's exactly what we should have done.  We should have just walked in and jumped and went out to eat afterwards. Also we did have an attendant assigned to our party however attendants should be a personal hype man for the Birthday person. No energy at all! Yes I did tip the attendant because the attendant did cut the cake.😁< /Text></record>

My child and i love this place. there are plenty of adults jumping with their children as well. Like the fact that there is a place designated for the very young children so they will not get hurt.< /review>

<text>It's a cool, awesome place...but it kinda gets boring sometimes. You guys need to to add more stuff like a foam pit. The drop zone is kinda like a foam pit but I don't really like it because there's few jump pad things. There's only three. Should add more jump pad things.  I just hate waiting in line.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c3280c3091bfbd:0x7f77c90379f26521<//gmap_id>< user_name>

Cool place. Safety is super important to these guys. Kids don't tire of trampoline fun. Food sub par and expensive. Not really worth the price but great fun if invited to birthday party.<//Review>

Weak safety protocols for players to follow. Only matter of time before needless serious injuries occur, especially in rock climb area. Kids will aren't climbing should not treat area as a playbox as climbers will fall on them resulting in injury. Not all players have common sense! A big thumbs up for Jay, the lone employee who took my concern seriously. Thanks Jay!!</text>

Super fun to go 2. U can get ur excerise and play with new people u never met. U get to meet the staff there and u get to become friends with the staff. The staff is really nice unless u do somerhing really dumb then they will tell u not to do that. Try it and see how u feel after u r done playing or even juar jumping over ans over<//Review>

<Review>Dangerous.. the teenage staff does not watch out for safety.. there are grown people jumping over little kids, people double jumping, people sitting on tramps.. bad place to take children. You have to buy special socks, which run small, and once you open them, your stuck with that size. Would not return here..< /Review></record></dataset><record>

If you want to let out your inner child, there's no better way then visiting Sky Zone indoor trampoline park!

I've heard so much about Sky Zone from friends and was thrilled when I saw that a Sky Zone was opening a couple miles way. This past weekend a group of my friends decided to take advantage of the $20 Saturday night deal for unlimited access from 9pm-12am (socks included, they usually charge $2 during regular hours).

The line was incredibly long when we arrived and to save time I highly suggest filling out the waiver beforehand. We waited about 20 minutes before we were able to pay admission and get our socks. Since we came during their Saturday night special, the place was extremely crowded and there were a bunch of kids everywhere. I definitely think I would have had a better experience if I came during off hours and were surrounded by people my own age.

Apparently the Covina Sky Zone is also smaller than some of the other locations. They have a dodgeball court, basketball area, foam pit, a general jumping area, and another area they closed off for private parties. When it got crowded, there were lines for everything and it took away from precious jumping time. I heard from my friends that the Anaheim location has two dodgeball courts so it could accommodate more people.

Overall I had an awesome time with my friends. Everyone should try Sky Zone at least once.  I also never thought jumping on trampolines could be so tiring. I definitely ran out of breath a couple times and had to rest quite a bit.

Tip* Leave valuables in your car. Lockers are available for 50 cents and there's a shoe rack  for you to place your belongings.< /Text>

My son absolutely loves this place. I would highly recommend getting your tickets on Groupon ahead of time because you will save at least 60%. I take my son at least once a week and only pay like $11 for both of us for one hour.< /text>

They did not accept out Groupon on our child’s birthday. I bought it that morning at 7am and drove from Temecula (2hr drive). He cried his eyes out so we had to pay for 4 people. They made us pay for socks that we had (jump socks) but were deemed unacceptable so we were charged again!!! They made me feel robbed! It feels scammy and a bit like “we gotcha”. Families want to go where they are treated well not taken advantage of! On top of it all the cashiers are so rude! AVOID THIS SCAM!!!< /Text>

I would give this specific location negative stars if possible. We booked a Glow event at this venue and had 2 hours of jump time. Unfortunately our guests couldn't even handle an hour due to the unbearable heat. The party room was no relief, we sat directly under the a/c vent and there was absolutely no air running through. I paid over $1,200 for my guests and I to sit there, baking for for 2 hours, drinking warm watered down soda because the ice would melt as soon as the pitchers were placed on the tables with how hot it was. Then to top it off, our food arrived an hour late and the managers did absolutely nothing to fix the problem. We left feeling terribly disappointed and frustrated because we looked forward to the celebration and it was all ruined due to the lack of proper ventilation and poor customer service. They've lost our business that's for sure, wouldn't return even for regular jump time, much less book another event with them.<//text>

Only thing negative about this place were the other sloppy guests that left a huge mess for the staff to clean up which went across 5 of the 10 tables available. Very rude and inconsiderate.
Other than that my kids had a blast! We'll visit again soon!!:)</review>

This place is awful. The place smells and it is so hot in there. They have no AC, just a bunch of fans. To top it off, they have terrible customer service. 👎👎👎<//Text>

Kids loved it of course it's lots of jumping but from an adults view, it needs to be cleaned and disinfected, the place smelled bad in the styrofoam pit area.< /Review>

Me and my 2yr old son enjoyed it it was both are first time they had a couple of things closed which was a let down also the place needs air condition and they only had one person working the snack bar as well but besides all of that i will go back just probably a different location.</Text>

This place is so unorganized, waited 40 min in line! They don't help people by line, they let people cut and then the manager  doesn't  out to help! They really need to get it together! Start off with more then one cashier to help us check in!</review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) It is the second time that I return with my 2-year-old girl, this time they charged me more, I did not understand why, in the end I had to ask for a refund since they charged me as an older girl $ 16 and she still belongs to the group of toddlers (1 to 5 years) which has a cost of $ 10.

The staff lacks a little more motivation :( maybe the routine makes them not be very warm.

For additional information on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 to 12 toddlers pay $ 8 and daddies free, I will return better during the week

(Original)
Es la segunda vez que vuelvo con mi niña de 2 años, en esta ocasión me cobraron más, no entendí por qué, al final tuve que pedir un reembolso ya que me cobraron como niña más grande $16 y ella aún pertenece al grupo de los toddlers (1 a 5 años) lo cual tiene un costo de $10.

Al personal le falta un poquito más de motivación :( quizás la rutina les hace no mostrarse muy cálidos.

Cómo información adicional los martes y jueves de 10 a 12 los toddlers pagan $8 y los papis gratis, regresaré mejor entre semana</review>
