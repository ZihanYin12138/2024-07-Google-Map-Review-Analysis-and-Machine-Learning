Love the subscription service. Ended up saving money per haircut. Usually I have no problem getting the stylist I want if I call early in the day to set up an appointment.< /Review>

I told her yes then she proceeded to tell it was ok come in still since your on ur way ill be able to take care of you so I get there 5 mins later only to be told by a differnt hair dresser that because I was late I wouldn't be able to receive service that made me very upset at the fact one person said come in and I waste my time and to only be turned away 😡 looks like I'm better spending my hard earned money at a much better place that would value  their Customers.

I went for a hair cut and the lady named Ally rushed through it and left my layers uneven and it's very noticeable I'm very upset about but what else can I do . She wasn't very professional I tried to ask her for some advice on what hair cut would look great on my curly hair and she dogded the question. She only did a trim and a few layers but it was very rushed like if she had to go somewhere after. I will not be going to this location again at all<//Review>

Tried to make an appointment online and their website said there was no waiting. When I showed up to get a haircut 15 minutes later,  they were booked for the rest of the night. Employee just shrugged and said the website is glinching. What a waste of my time.</text>

I got there on time and Sasha was finishing a color application. Great- she'll cut my hair while the color is being timed.  No way! She came to the register fiddled around, did not acknowledge me, and disappeared into the back. After 15 minutes, I asked one of the girls if my name  was on the list - yes it was. After another 10 minutes I left.  Terrible customer service! I wouldn't be so angry if Sasha had at least acknowledged me and given me an approximate additional wait time.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

They take to long, when I asked if my Daughters were next after being skipped 4x the worker insureds me my Daughters will be next, she just has to sweep up her chair and floor then turns to her coworkers and laughs I’m going home right now hahah. She continued to clean up her chair and floor area and then left without helping me or telling me someone will be with you shortly. They have no organization nor  consideration for other people’s time. Don’t come here if your looking for  Organization and time management skilled staff.<//Review>

Update - I finally got my turn at 4:45 (only one women was left at the shop) — she was very nice but I felt bad that she was forced to help everyone out while the others left.< /review>< pics>

I went in yesterday for only a trim from the lungs of my hair and on my bangs. I told the lady that I want to keep the style of my bangs I just need it to be trimmed. She then proceedshe to cut the left side straight across, not at all what the style was. And she didneeds just cut what were my bangs, on the left side she cut a large portion of what was part of the length of my hair, now extending my bangs. I'm a very insecure person and this haircut makes me feel embarrassed. This is worst haircut I've ever had.<//Review>

<Review>Horrible service. We didn't have an appointment but we didnt have to wait long. My daughter wanted her hair cut to her shoulders. Something very simple. I showed the lady a picture ans she seemed like she understood. Her mame was Ally. Like I said it was a simple haircut. My daughter sat in that chair for over two hours with her head bent down for most of the time. Another lady had to come to fix it because Ally wasnt cutting it the length we wanted. After walking out my daughted told me that Ally told my daughter she better stops moving her head up or she's going to cut her hair even shorter. I was so upset. I went back inside to speak to a manager and found out that they dont have one. And Ally wasnt there. She left on lunch. How long do they expect a child to sit in a chair? All because Ally didnt know what she was doing.</Review>< Pictures>

I'm pretty sure the larger woman with the purple hair purposely ruined my hair. I've never seen a cut so disgusting. I wish I could post a picture on here. I cry every time I look in the mirror. It was supposed to be a bob so now it's too short to even correct it. She smelled like weed at 10 am so maybe it was unintentional, but she had to have been really high to do this on accident.<//review>

Don't come here for a men's hair cut. Or maybe I just had a bad person. The lady cutting my hair I think name is Luciana? Anyways she nicked my neck during my haircut which left a spot of dry blood on my neck and she didn't even wipe it. and kept constantly spraying water in my hair which dripped down to my face and neck. A little water for styling is okay but she was over doing it felt like I was taking a shower. And I just wanted a simple casual clean cut for combover. She didn't even clean it good the sides were really uneven. Had to go back in and ask her to fix a little but after that she still couldn't make it look clean. I just wanted to leave at this point. For a $20 haircut I expect something that doesn't look terrible. It was just so uneven I had my girlfriend fix it with a pair of scissors to fix the uneven haircut. She's not even licensed and did a better job than this so called hair stylist.  Never coming back here again!</Review>

I can't even give one star to this location and this company, But since I have to choose one and there is no negative. This is by far the worst business plan I have ever heard of. We refuse service thirty minutes before closing.. The Location closes at 7:00 pm we arrived at 6:30 Pm  The stylist decided that they were too busy with other clients to service us . There were two stylists working, one cutting and one cleaning her area (I assume she had just finished with another customer) There was a man and a woman waiting in the lounge.  There could have been other customers on the wait list, but the minute I walk through the door I am a paying customer I should not be refused service or turned away because they don't want to work past closing or corporate does not want to pay them overtime. If those are the reasons then fine just close earlier, but don't blow off paying customers. If I go to any restaurant or even the CA DMV ten minutes before closing, They might not like it but I am serviced as a paying customer. Not that I make this a habit but it happens, just like employees have to work past there scheduled hours. If I was offered to wait I would have been ok with that. That would have been an acceptable solution rather than NO! I did call the other shaw location and that is what I was told if I get there before closing I can wait and I will be helped THAT'S FAIR. When I called customer service the lady that answered gave me same lame reason they were probably full on the wait list, I'm sure I know what they were full of (s***). She would not even put me in contact with the local district manager to tell her what's going on.That's horrible business skills and terrible practice for repeat customers but I guess when your a big chain it doesn't matter. Throw away the customer service and pump out clients. Boo Hoo to supercuts..< /Text>

Don't expect to be seen on time even if you scheduled in advance. The stylist don't follow the mobile app appointment check in. Had to wait even though I scheduled way in advance.</Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>This has been our home for the last 3 1/2 years. We have great neighbors. A couple of them have even become good trusted friends. The manager is very patient and understanding but also no pushover! This seems to be a decent little community.

Just made a quick pickup there. Seems like a well ordered modular home park with a very festive entrance. They really display their holiday spirit!</review>

< Review>
Wish I wouldve listened to the reviews. The managers are the worse! The houses are falling apart. The managers love to harass people, and love to threaten you about evicting you for everything. Ive lived at at least three other parks throughout my life, and none have ever had this bad of management. They take FOREVER to fix anything and just stucko and spray paint it. There are cats & skunks EVERYWHERE! Dont move here.< /Review>

The first thing to know is that everyone who works here has a true passion and huge knowledge base from personal detailing experience in the detailing business. I can’t imagine a better place to get your vehicle detailed then their onsite shop. They have a vast selection of supplies and equipment and cater to everyone from the home auto enthusiast who likes to detail their own vehicles to large detailing businesses. Their prices are always competitive even with the online giant retailers.  Detailing also offers detail training that is world class and I’ll write a second review regarding my experience after going through their training program later. Detailing.com can answer any of your questions and supply you with everything you need, why would you buy from an online giant?<//text>< pictures>

Used to love this store for all my supplies. But seeing as I cant even get will call option during these times and have to wait for a ceramic coat kit to be shipped to me 10 miles down the freeway, that cost me trust of a very high end customer and a very big job. I'll place on last order and take my business elsewhere.</review>

<Review>I made the 25 mile drive to Irvine so I can buy the Sonax Perfect Finish (small bottle) and to stock up on some Rupes yellow pads on a Saturday morning so I can put a weekend of paint correction work down. I talked to Rene, the owner, I hope I spelled your name right, about my project that should be left for professionals and not hardcore DIYers like me haha, a black F430. I explained the tools and products I own and that I’m using which consists of Rupes Mille, Rupes mini Bigfoot and Rupes ibrid with Menzerna Heavy Cut 400 and Menzerna 3000 polish. Just by telling Rene what I’ve been doing he diagnosed some technique errors on my part and gave me the proper advice that I needed to hear to be able to get outstanding paint correction. It was great to start a weekend in my garage being able to talk to a seasoned pro and to geek out about paint correction products and tools to get me motivated on taking on a difficult task. This store carries all kinds of high end companies that I didn’t know were sold at a brick and mortar store and I thought was online only and from here on out I’ll make the drive to buy these products here to support this business. I went home with a new Scangrip light, Sonax Perfect Finish, some nice microfiber towels for ceramic coating and most importantly, more confidence to be able to do my project at a very high level!!!< /Review>< Rate>

unfriendly place- great supplies- diverse stock but, I’ve been here a few times and it’s just not a friendly helpful place- I always felt like I’m on my own in this place - we all but things that don’t need explanation but, these products need people that know them and are willing to help you understand them and they don’t do  that here - perhaps that’s why every time I’m in there I seem to be the only person looking around< /Text>

The knowledgeable staff, convenient location, quality selection, and excellent pricing keep me coming back.  Their prices typically meet or beat the big online retailers (think Florida) without having to wait a week for shipping.

They obviously don't have every niche brand out there, but they will have something that will get the job done.  I have yet to ask about a specific problem and walk away with a solution that didn't work.  They usually nail it on the first try, too, saving me time and money.

It's so nice to have a professional level detail supply store so close to home.<//Text>

I can't say enough good things about this place.  They have a huge selection of the latest and greatest professional detailing products on the market.  Not only that- they have the staff and customer service to back it up.  If you have any detailing or paint correction concerns- come here and talk to these guys first.</text>

Our shipping department shipped out your order in less than 24 hours as guaranteed and unfortunately there appears to be a delay or interruption of service with USPS which is outside of our control. We will gladly issue a full credit back for the shipping fees paid and apologize for any inconvenience. If USPS has lost or damaged your shipment, we will issue a replacement order at no charge, but we cannot file a claim or tracer yet because today is still within their quoted 3-day delivery window.\n\nWe ask that you please consider updating your review of 1-star as today is still the 3rd business day from your order, and if it is not delivered by end of day today it was for circumstances outside of our control (USPS weather delay or service outages) - we shipped your order via 3-day Priority as indicated the first thing in the morning following your order the night before. We have answered all of your support requests by email and phone and have advised we would monitor the shipment and resolve promptly if not delivered by end of day today. If you have any additional questions regarding your order or if we can assist further please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

I've been on leave from work for 2 weeks now and they towed my car for abandonment. When I called to speak to a manager he asked me "What do you want?" And I when I explained the situation he told me "Just pay the fee" then hung up on me. They did place a warning sticker on my car on the back windshield even though I was reversed into a bush. There was no way I could see the warning sticker passing by regularly, they hid the sticker from plain sight.</Text>< Time>

The guy was rude not to mention my son got his window broken out after they took his car, they charged my son 500 hundred bucks to get his car out and they only had it less than an hour.. Be careful where you park your car cause they had a parking permit and still they got there car towed and the guy had to have already been at the spot where we were cause we had just barley got there when someone came and told us they took my sons car. This was a horrible experience and they will over charge you more than its worth
Now after paying 500 bucks to get the car out now he has to pay for a broken window that happened after Sierra Towing took his car and the guy said he wasnt paying for it cause he didnt do.< /Text>

Extremely rude! My moms car was towed and her mediation and purse were in the car. She just wanted the info on what she needed to do to be able to get the belongs out of the vehicle. The guy who answered the phone basically said he didn’t care her diabetes medication was in there, he’s not releasing anything. She wasn’t asking him to do anything to risk his job. She just wanted whatever information was necessary to start working on getting the car released or getting at least her belonging. She was even willing to pay whatever their fees were. (Which she did and paid $132) just to get her purse out the car! Both the guys she spoke to were rude! Both Matt and John!!<//Text>

I witness one of their driver slow down to about 25mph at a stop sign then just drove right through in Fresno County. When I called and talk to the manager, Mark, he was not professional about and did not seemed to care. Oh well, just trying to help them from a big accident. I sure won't ever trust that kind of tow company towing my car!< /review>

<user>106297014618442150005<//user><review>These guys towed my truck a day after the notice said it would be towed. So I thought I was in the clear....just filled up and was inside for 20 minutes...engine was warm. Windows down. Paperwork and coffee on the dash. So... Getting towed because it was abandoned is BS. However, I decided to let the lien take place. The cars they have for sale are cheaper than the tow and storage fees. They ended up be cool once I talked about the situation. Still wouldn't release my truck though. LoL.</review><date>1557420166522<//date><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

As i was getting my property he didnt hover or rush me as it was already after 5.  It was a truly amazing experience considering what was going on anyone in need of a friendly and courteous tow truck driver should call Sierra's Towing.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Towed my car from my apartments said the were stickers on there didn’t have no impressions of having a sticker on there blamed rain and tentants there aware that take off stickers should send a extra notice to your unit if they know that overall tho they were pretty cool took $120 off supposedly cause I really didn’t see it paid $229 was suppose to be $350 seem like they kinda make there own prices so just watch the way you talk to them cause they can overcharge you if they want</text>

The worst towing company in town. They will tell you something else on the phone and when it comes to charging, they will charge you double the amount. Please beware of this company. Also the employees working in this company are super rude. When you ask them that the price doesnot match of what they were telling you the previous day, Supervisor started telling some california laws that a person has not even heard in their lifetime. Also the tone that the supervisor and the person spoke was so unprofessional. Please beware of this towing company before you go to them.< /Text>

<Text>This is one of the lower class tow company's I have had to deal with. Their professionalism is seriously lacking. And seems they don't follow any of the laws or respect the people that keep them in business. Most of their business comes from hiring criminal auto thiefs. Or at least train their employees to become such. These drivers wait until hard working people are fast asleep, usually around 3am.and sneek around Fresno steeling cars knowing very well people have to get up and go to work the next day.... Then charge outrageous prices to get their cars back.< /Text>< Response>

Towed my car for parking in a red zone. That's fine. However they charged me $350 before they even had my car for 24 hrs. While speaking on the phone the guy was rude and condescending. I see these guys come into apartments every night. Their heads are swiveling looking for anything to tow and take advantage of.<//Review>

<Text>Customer service was great!! Driver did a quick job and got my vehicle to my destination in a timely matter. However, i called a day before to schedule a next day pick for an appointment at the dealer. And I had to reschedule my appointment from early morning to mid day because tow truck came almost an hour after the scheduled time.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is one of the most awful companies I’ve ever dealt with. The manager is horrendous to speak with and adds fees on at a whim without any notice. My car was in the lot for a day and I was charged $600<//Review>< Pictures>

James is the absolute best!! Courteous, kind, and very thorough. Trust that his work and Flood Brothers in general give you the highest quality. They aren’t looking to add to the damage or drama, just truly want to help solve what his happening.
We had a leak in a bathtub  and some water pressure issues with our pot filler. He took his time, checked to see if the parts on the tub were under warranty (they were!) and ordered and came back to install. James is a dream! Thank you Flood Brothers.</Text>

I've had Flood Brothers do a couple of jobs for my condo; and they were great both times. The first time was my kitchen sink overflowing with sewage backup. They had to replace some rickety old pipes under the house that were leaking all over before they could unclog the system, leaving a much more solid, functional setup afterward. They came back when I needed some pipes replaced that connect to the main sewer, which required digging under the foundation. They finished in one day, and replaced corroded old sub-standardly sized pipes with new 4" ABS. Mike, Jerry, Hector, and Mynor were all great on both jobs, and communicative throughout. The work was solid, and price fair.< /Text>

<Text>I'm so impressed with Giulio and the team at Flood Brothers. I can't stress enough how grateful I am to have found them. Giulio made multiple visits to assess the issues of our home, free of charge. He brought other professionals with him as well, who specialize in the various problems we had, to be able to give me a thorough evaluation and estimate. He and Anthony were always on time, communicative and direct. I also never felt pressured to use their services. He understood I may have had an opportunity to have my home warranty company do the repairs at no cost to me, and he never once asked me to pay for his time and efforts up to that point. He only stressed that I make sure the work was done correctly so that I avoid any problems in the future. I was treated like family, as if my own brother was watching out for me and our home. I will be using them for all my plumbing issues--especially after the horrific experience I had with the shady home warranty plumber. If it wasn't for Giulio, I would have a river flowing under my home. Do yourself a favor and call them for an estimate if you have any plumbing concerns, it will be WORTH your time.</Text>< pics>

I rarely leave reviews, but I just had such a positive experience and I’m so grateful to Flood Brothers and especially Junior the plumber.

My husband is very sick and I am struggling to keep up with the needs of his illness on top of everything else life is throwing at us.

Today my 2 year old water heater stopped working and my husband, who is normally quite handy, couldn’t deal with the emergency, so I called Flood Brothers out of the blue.

Junior arrived promptly, got it going quickly, and said it was “no charge”.

I was so beside myself, I almost cried. I have no relationship with this plumber or his company. They don’t know me at all, but Junior chose to do the kindest of things.

I am so grateful to him for his sweet gesture that I will from now on call Junior “my plumber” and will recommend Flood Brothers to everyone I know.

Thank you, Junior.<//Text>

I am a busy working mom and when my kitchen sink stopped draining the other night - late on a Saturday - I knew I couldn’t wait to get it fixed. Jeff from Flood Brothers was at my home in under an hour. He identified and fixed the issue right away and was communicative, informative and wonderful to work with. I’m so relieved to have found this company!< /text>

Having been a homeowner for decades and worked with countless plumbers in new construction, renovations, and repairs I feel I am qualified to provide an informed opinion and recommendation.  Not only was the work done efficiently, timely, and professionally it was done to the highest standards.  Flood Brothers stands behind their work and do not exaggerate or drag on their work.  Similar to going to a dentist or a doctor you need to be able to trust your professional.  I trust Flood Brothers they are professionals and straight shooters, their price may not be the lowest but the quality and their word is their bond.  I not only use Flood Brothers for all of my plumbing needs but would only use Flood Brothers.  They have installed new gas lines, installed fixtures, reconnected broken sewer connections- they do it all and all to precision.  Expect multiple eyes on their jobs from the Supervisor to the plumbers in the field.  Without reservation I whole heartedly recommend Flood Brothers!<//Text>

Incredible service. My toilet got backed up at 9PM and water started leaking through the sheet rock on the first floor. I found Flood Brothers and they answered the phone and sent Junior to my house within 30 minutes. He fixed the issue and also found other issues that needed to be addressed. He was knowledgeable, courteous, professional, and reasonable with pricing. 5 star service.</text>

First, let me just say that they just don't make service professionals and companies like this anymore!  As a onetime home remodeler and designer I have had a lot of experience hiring professionals over the years. There is ONE attribute above else I have found to be the most important when partnering with any service contractor on a job.  And that attribute is INTEGRITY.

Fortunately, that is exactly what I found with Jerry at Flood Brothers Plumbing.  Sometimes in the service business things don't always go as they should or you would like them to. When these things happen you want to partner with someone that is able to see things from your point of view, be your champion and see things thru to a positive conclusion.  Jerry went above and beyond my expectations of superb service in every way.

Thank you so much Jerry for all you did on my behalf, I won't forget it. And thanks to Chris and everyone else who participated.  Please do check out this company if you have any plumbing needs. I am sure you will not be disappointed.<//Text>

Had a clogged sink drain from peeling too many potatoes into the garbage disposal. It was 8pm and I found flood brothers plumbing on Yelp. They had good reviews and they provided 24 hour service. I called them and everyone was helpful. Brandon was awesome, professional and did a great job! Definitely gonna use them again.< /text>

I contacted Flood Brothers for help on faucet repair and hot water heater installation.  I had excellent service and wanted to recognize three members of the Flood Brothers team - Giulio, Chris, and Isaiah.  They were professional, got the job done quickly, and were a pleasure to communicate with.  All this during a global pandemic!  Very happy with the service I received and would use Flood Brothers in the future.</review>

Flood Bros plumbing were considerate, timely, economical, respectful, knowledgeable, and neat. I have them install a water heater in my home and they were in and out in a flash and left no trace of their presence other than the positive memories of them blessing me with hot water once again. I would recommend them to anybody in need of honest, high quality plumbing work performed in their home or business.<//Text>

This company is very well ran and extremely professional.  I had them come out to check my duct system.   Another company said I needed the whole thing replaced.   Not so, just need a deep cleaning.   Which I will be doing with, when I have the money as it's a bit pricey (for me) however I find their prices reasonable and their honesty refreshing!!

I was living in an old house where the toilet just kept overflowing at least twice a month. The super would come by and do NOTHING! Flood Brothers recommended a few parts (less than 30$) and installed them for literally nothing. Awesome service. They get down to the nittg gritty at an amazing value! Will never use an other plumber again.<//text>

Had these guys come out for a Pipe repair before my son's birthday party, I expected the last minute repair to be an arm and a leg. When they were done and handed me the bill I was shocked at the price. They resolved the problem, quickly and without any additional charges. They had the pipe back up and water flowing as the first guests arrived. Great service, came on time and made sure to leave no signs of repair. I hope I have no need, but if I do I will use them again!< /Review>

Giulio was great. I heard back from him within a few minutes of calling the office, and he explained possible options on the phone for my clogged toilet. We made an appointment for that same morning. He arrived on time, with mask and gloves for Covid safety. Giulio fixed the toilet in no time and left me with a functioning toilet and a clean bathroom. Great service. Thank you!</review>

<Review>I called at 8:40 pm on a Sunday evening and their technician, Giulio, was able to come by in less than 15 minutes! It was a plugged toilet. He used his magic wand LOL and in less than a minute the clog was no more! He was professional, clean (not only wore a mask, but gloves and booties too), quick, and very nice. I'm sooo happy and pleased with Flood Brothers Plumbing and especially Giulio! Will definitely recommend and use again!<//Review><username>Sheryl Klein<//username>< Rate>

<Review>Love Flood Brothers! Giovanni has always helped my roommates and I. As young female college students, we were scared to go to a random company to only get scammed or over quoted when our bathroom flooded. Giovanni was extremely fair with the price rather than other companies we had contacted. 10/10 recommend!</Review>< pictures>

I was wrong: they were here within 45 minutes and fixed my bathtub 10 minutes after that. Giulio our technician was polite sweet professional and a total gentleman.

Mike and his team are great! I wish every home service provider was as nice, honest, diligent, and responsive as Flood Brothers. Excellent customer service and communication. They do great work and take the time to explain things clearly and thoroughly. Love the constant updates via emails/text/phone. They've now done two jobs for me, and I wouldn't hesitate to hire them again.</text>

Had Flood Brothers install an earthquake valve on my gas line.  They were there when promised, took care of the problem, and at a fair price.  Very satisfied in every respect.</Text>

< Review>
Working with Flood Brothers from start to finish was a complete pleasure. After contacting several plumbers (all of which didn't respond or couldn't schedule someone until far out in the week), communicating with Flood Brothers on the other hand was quick & easy. On first reach out they answered immediately and scheduled someone to stop by the next day.

Giulio was prompt, efficient, and professional. He fixed our stopped up sink in minutes and communicated about the problem every step of the way. Thank you Giulio, we can't wait to call you for all our future plumbing needs!< /Review>

<review>It’s never a good thing to have a plumbing problem on a Sunday evening. I found Flood Brothers and spoke to Anthony, very responsive and he immediately called Brendan.

Brendan, the technician, immediately returned my call. We discussed the problem and he was on his way. He was able to successfully stop the water flow to get us stabilized for the night.

I was impressed with the responsiveness and professionalism from the first phone call to the actual service call. They show you who is coming with a photo and name, stayed in touch re ETA, and were there quickly.

I wouldn’t hesitate to call them again. Very nice, very professional. Many thanks!!< /review><userid>110003448738611475469</userid>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Flood Brothers responded to my request immediately, and scheduled an appointment the same day. I got advance notice that my technician was on the way, including the name and photo of the person who was coming. I got the drain service I needed plus a faucet repair that was an add on, with pricing that accounted for the combined job. I have used Flood Brothers for a year intensively, for every little problem and the big jobs, too. I'm so grateful I have them on my side to look after my building. Great Service!<//Review>

Flood Brothers Plumbing, and specifically Jerry, provided my husband and I with the best experience we could have ever asked for during our incredibly stressful situation. After our condo began to flood, we called another plumbing company's emergency hotline, and got no answer. We called Flood Brothers and they answered immediately. Within 2 hours, Jerry arrived at our home and spent the next 7 hours not only fixing our pipe, but flushing the pipes of the entire condo building. Jerry was calm, cool, collected, and was an EXCELLENT communicator. He thoroughly explained each part of his process, leaving no questions unanswered. It's so hard to find someone who genuinely cares about the safety and well-being of their customers these days, and we were blown away by how thorough Jerry was and how professional and clear he was. We can't recommend him enough.<//review>

When I bought my house, inspections revealed that the sewer line from the sidewalk to the city connection was old and cracked. Also, a section of sewer line in the crawlspace under the house was clay pipe, which is the wrong kind of pipe.

I called a few plumbers; Flood Brothers was by far the most professional in their response. Michael came out, looked things over and told me that I didn't have to pay to replace the cracked sewer line yet, as it still had some lifespan left in it. He recommended adding a cleanout for easy access in the future. Great idea!

He hydrojetted the sewer line, added the cleanout, and replaced the clay pipe under my house. I was out of town during the work, and his communication was excellent: he was conscientious in keeping me informed about the status of the job.

In a year, he will come back and send a camera down the line at no cost to me, to see if it's still holding up. Fantastic that Flood Brothers stand by their work!

I'd recommend Flood Brothers for sure. They're on my list for the next big job, installing a tankless water heater...< /Review>

<Review>I have never been more impressed with a plumbing company in my life. Michael came to my house right on time, answered any and all questions I had, and was completely friendly and patient with me. (I can be a little overbearing). He fixed the problem completely. I had called two separate plumbing companies previously, still the problem with my toilet continued. Now I dont have to worry about my bathroom flooding and causing damage to the downstairs units. He even cleaned up after himself thoroughly! (Something I never see other plumbing companies do.)I would like to give a big thanks to Michael and Flood Brothers Plumbing for being to helpful and kind!< /Review></record>

<review>As an area Realtor I can only recommend the best of the best because a referral is a reflection. When Flood brothers Plumbers come to the home, their vehicles are so nice you'd think this is going to cost extra. Then their plumbers are in uniforms and put booties on to enter people's homes, and you'll think I must have hired a high end plumbing company BUT this is a wonderful family owned business that just takes the time to be different from the run of the mill plumbing companies out there. The get that attention to detail matters. As for the plumbing itself, they review the situation, discuss the options in a non alarmist or fear mongering way, and give you solutions to your plumbing issues that are sound advice and fair on your budget. They're fabulous. You won't be disappointed.< /review>< Resp>

Average. To their credit, they were the only plumber after 5 calls who answered on a Saturday night. They cleared a root intrusion, replaced several feet of sewer pipe and installed a clean out. Problem was they didn't properly back-fill support the new pipe and it had a 1"-2" shift to the existing pipe. I asked one of the brothers to come back and fix it properly, citing that I had a camera inspection done from another company showing the poor workmanship. He got insulin and insisted the video footage didn't matter. Not only did he have to do HIS camera inspection, but it was imperative that I interrupt my busy day and come on site to see the result.  Fine. The day scheduled they went several hours early and then called saying "ok, yeah we'll fix it."

They eventually did the job properly, but not without some unprofessional behavior from one of the owners.

Update: Owner called me and apologized for his behavior. His PR guy called me again a week later. Ok, he did the right thing. Job was eventually done right. He took steps to make the communication experience better.</review>

<Review>I help caretake for a church in Pasadena area and have been using Flood Brothers for around 2 years. I personally feel it was a God given privilege to have been able to run into Geovanni and start a friendship that I believe will last forever. Flood Brothers has done a vast array of plumbing work in the church, and since the building is close to 100 years old it is not a typical everyday type of task to do service there. But his workers have very knowledgeable, treat people with huge respect, and work very hard at being dependable. Through tremendous efforts, working with 26 inch cement walls they have installed a new water main line from the street and repiped most of the church. We were so happy with the work they did that when it came time to install a complete new gas line we never had a second thought of who we want to do this. If your looking for a regular plumber, I highly recommend Flood Brothers for all your plumbing needs.< /Review><time>1448393533487<//time><Name>Paul Sarver</Name></record>

Omg, that's the best Mitaki Poke And Sushi spot so far. Super generous portions of fish, avocado at no extra charge!!! All ingredients are super fresh. Toppings are available at the self-service bar. Great experience.< /review>

Sushi is always high quality and delicious and when you visit, always welcomed with a hello and takes your order very quick.

I asked for eel sauce. The MANAGER she looked me straight in my face and said teriyaki is the same thing. Like Im some kind of dumbass. "Not we dont have any sorry: she just didnt want to get it. Not coming back here. I've been here before, eel sauce is kept in the back. If you dont want to deal with customers dont run a business. I NEVER come shop in this plaza but now I never will again. My entire lunch sucked. Sushi west is right down the street, which is where I went to get my eel sauce, dont waste your time eating here.</Review>

<review>I have been going to the Court for 6 years now and every time I leave im always satisfied 100%. I have had the pleasure of having Grandpa cut my hair first, then I was passed down to Steven when he retired! I am a customer for life here, thanks for all my hair cuts Steven!!

Went here for the first time in at least 12 years. Long time between visits not because of service but due to the fact that I shave my head. Went in to have my beard trimmed. The trim was good and my barber friendly. I will definitely be back for my next visit.</Text>

I came from ohio to see my maw out here and she said this place was good.
Well, I was doubtful because my Barber in my small town is pretty good but I gave it a shot and wasn't disappointed
I didn't catch her name but the woman furthest down by the tv did my straight shave.
I was a little doubtful on how good she would do but man did she prove me wrong! Honestly better then my Barber in ohio.
Anytime I come back this Barber Shop will be my first stop!
Thanks for making this experience so great and go blue !<//Text>

Okay, first off, do not waste your time here.

I went into the barbershop today, and it took an hour and 15 minutes to cut my hair. I would not mind that if the haircut looked nice, but there was no blending of the "fade" he gave me. I asked him to do some things for me, he said he "could not because my hair wasn't ready to be cut that short" so I accepted it, went to another barber and they did exactly what I asked for. Not only that, dude also used a straight razor on my head, that had to have been the dullest razor that's ever touched my head. My Gillette razor gets a closers shave than that garbage. The straw that broke the camels back, that made me write this review.. After everything I looked at my hair in the mirror, and the line up was so uneven, fade so unblended, I was so furious I just accepted the fact that I'm going to pay for another haircut today.

All in all, just go to a barber with well reviews, not this one.<//text>

<Review>I came here many times to buy veggie pizza . Price is reasonable, taste is very good . I like little Caesar cheese that’s why I recommend to buy pizza from here . Staff is super active and service is also good . We can order online and in store easily  and pizza ready with in 15-20 minutes. We can wait outside this shop inside car if order in store . There are many deals on pepperoni 🍕 pizza, and chicken pizza but I’m vegetarian so I buy veggie pizza only but it’s cheap not good expensive. We can enjoy eating every weekend . Thank you 😊👍<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This is my fav spot for a quick bite to eat at a reasonable price. So try not to over crowd this place because the wait can take up to 20mins!! I hope the employees get a good pay, they work very hard and are friendly despite some rude customers who come thru with nasty attitudes. If people make the time to order thru their online system, they wouldn't have time to complain otherwise you have no right but to just deal w. It.. Many Thanks to the young man who's always very polite and professional at the cashier ID: 2, just hearing his deep voice, I know I'm in good hands.< /Text>

<text>Horrible, The cashier was at the front of the store and i tried opening the door a couple minutes before they opened and then once it was 10:30 she didn’t open up but the second i left the parking lot she went and opened it and was being petty for no reason at all and trying to get someone to take your order takes forever< /text>< Rating>

I came here about 2 months ago. I ordered a hawaiian pizza and the crazy bread combo, which I always order. I ended up waiting for 1 hour. The cashier tried compensating me for the wait by giving me a larger container of crazy sauce, and the hawaiian pizza was good ... but the bread sticks were TERRIBLE. Felt like it was sitting in the heater for 3 hours. Out of everything, at least the bread sticks should've been good. But nope. Never coming back here again. Little Caesar's reputation has been destroyed for me.< /Review>

Good for cheap pizza. Though at 7 pm on a weeknight they didn't have any hot and ready pizza ready. But only about a 15 minute wait.<//review>

This place is so well run. The shop is clean & tidy. The staff are fast & friendly. It seems like no matter what time of day, this spot is dealing with a constant onslaught of hungry customers, and they handle it spectacularly. Like, it's seriously impressive.<//text>

Fast and friendly...good pizza for the price. I have always had quick service and they are usually very fast. Once in a while they will not have all of the hot n ready pizzas stoked and that is why the 4 stars. Don't forget the crazy bread and some wings...they are good as well.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been a customer of this Little Cesar’s for about 10 years now and I have never had such a horrible experience when it comes to ordering a pizza whether it’s over the phone, walking in, or through the app. Your employee Michael; little man with a deep voice, 3 times my pizza has been given away while I was right in front of the do-do. Did not even receive an apology, he’s arrogant, and no sense of customer service. He makes every employee there look bad, the company bad, and and most of all the management. There’s a lot of horse play and grab ass going on in the back. Seems like there isn’t any management. There’s been times that the line has been out the door with only one employee on the register and 5 or 6 employees goofing off in the back. My household orders a pizza at the minimum of 2 times a week. And every time I ask to speak with a manger, I’m am always handed extra food to make up for my order being incorrect, this has not happened once or twice, but many many many times. This is clearly a direct reflection of the management, if there is any.< /Review>

The current manager here is really friendly and has a great laid-back feel, but things are still done right. Customer service here is on-point. The location lacks parking spaces (it's been like this for years) so you may want to bring a friend to have them run in for you. If you order anything but a hot-and-ready, call before arriving otherwise the wait is ~15 minutes and they do not have waiting chairs.<//review>

Well...I shouldn't get asked questions about everywhere that I visit, it's kinda "eerryy". But I don't go to that location ever, just happened to be on that side of town. Someone from the establishment, recognized me from the nieghborhood,"the block". They hooked me up with crazy bread&thin crust 3 meat.< /review>

"Hot and ready" pizza was not ready. I was quoted 10-15 minutes. My order took almost 25. The cashier was not professional at all, joked inappropriately while handing me my order. This was my first visit to this location, definitely was also my last.</review>

I ordered 2 pizza and crazy bread and sauce before 7 min before closing they still took the order. so I drove over to pick it up thinking it was nice of them to take last min order. they were closing as expected so I called when I pulled up and Mariah pick up told me they three away the pizza's because I should know that they close at 10. So I said then why did you take the order and why waist food. She said she didn't take the order. As I see her messing around with a co worker I ask who took the order. She said everyone busy to ask. I said so you can ask a simple question it was a male.She said we 3 make. So I said ask. She was irritated and said Vince took your order. I told them next time don't pick up the phone or tell people your closing you can not take order anymore like the one on berryessa . So upset I drove over for a kid to tell me she threw it away. She could have said we didn't make it or give to the homeless outside. so I ordered from pizza hut.<//Text>

<Review>This store is very slow with orders. I don't think they know the concept of time. The original wait of 15 mins became 45 mins for a simple order. If you're trying to order their specialty pizzas, Goodluck.</Review>< Pictures>

This is the best location within the area hands down. The pizza and bread appears to be tastier maybe fresher , possibly cooked better..?? Not really sure what thier magic is but it is noticably different from the other local locations. When my 8 year old request pizza from this paticular location and both her and her 2yr old sibling leave no left overs I will make the drive regardless of the one located down the street from me.</text>

if you havent tried Babe Kombucha yet, you are seriously missing out on an excellent drink and time. They can give you a factory floor tour, just ask for Pavan (the owner). They have the best jard kombucha flavors in town. Ask for samples, or just fill up with growlers to go< /Review>

<Time>1603129379518<//Time><rate>4< /rate><text>I just end up going here a lot more often than I would think. It seems like the proximity to USD keeps the lineup of the eateries fresh.

It's close to my neighborhood but not really a place I can walk to easily and even a bit far for a quick bike ride.  If you live on the trolley line it's right next to the Morena station.  The parking is the only thing I have against this location.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I absolutely love this Dr. He delivered both of my boys, 13 and 10. He remembers every detail about you and that is a huge plus for me because it makes every appointment more comfortable. He takes the time to get to know you and answers any concerns you have. When I was in labor he went to check up on me a few times and I felt very safe and cared for. Because he is on call for delivery, there will be days where your wait time will be longer. I personally didn't mind the wait because I knew he was delivering with one of his patients. If I could give him 10 stars instead of 5 I definitely would. Great doctor❤<//Text>< user>

I have a total of two pregnancy and, unfortunately, Dr. Azizzadeh wasn’t able to preform on my first delivery, but he was able to on my second delivery. He was super patience with my delivery and I was very comfortable with him. He took his time and calm me down and he showed that he really cared. Because he was very patience and very caring, I did not tear with my second delivery. Comparing my two delivery was an eye opener for me. I wish I can turn back time and have Dr. Azizzadeh perform the delivery with my first child. There are different types of Doctors out there. Ones that are just trying to get the job done, and others who really care about their patients. Since this is a very important part in life, you should go with ones that really care and does it well also. And Dr. Azizzadeh is the best. Thank you so much for all that you do.</review>

<text>I choose Dr. Azzizzadeh for the 2nd time because I had a great experience with him treating me the 1st time. Wait time sometimes can be a little longer than expected but then again I understand every patient he treats is different & some patients may require more time than others. Staff was always helpful and will answer my questions without any issue.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My name Evelyn Castellanos. Dr. Jonathan Azizzadeh is the best. He has good service and the wait time is only 30 minutes. I had two pregnancies with him that was high risk with IUGR I had gone to previous doctors and they refused to take me. Hehas patience, and give us good prenatal care. He also good staff that cares about there patients.</text>

He is a very good doctor. He is my first pregnancy doctor.  I was in labor for 32 hours because I was induce and wanted it have it natural..although i had to have an emergency c seccion, he was very kind and gengle, and orDer a room jus for my self to comFort me. He is an amazing surgeon, my daughter is now 3 1/2 and there is no sign that i had a surgery. But, there is always a but.  To be honest the hospital nurses were not very good and friendly as his clinic nurses, but I won't change him.<//Review>

I always enjoy going to this doctors office. Dr. Azizzadeh is informative and really good at what he does. He comes off as really quiet, but he focuses on diagnosing any issues more than anything else. He has a process and really takes pride in doing a good job and answering your questions. At this doctors office, I've been through it all. I've had to be consoled by his staff (who are amazingly cheerful and good people), and have had long drawn out conversations about my health concerns with his technicians. Any concern I had would be addressed and the doctor was responsive to my concerns and would make them his concerns. He's picked up what other doctors have missed and really paid attention to the details. Because of him, I found out that I need to be on top of my papsmears because of the presence of cancer causing cells in my body. I never would have known without him and the colposcopy that he performed. I would highly recommend his staff to any of my friends and even to anyone who is looking for a really good OBG-YN. It's really really convenient that he's located right next to the hospital in case you have emergencies and he will drop everything to look after you when you go to that hospital to deliver your baby. From what I noticed, some patients aren't very happy that the doctor is not always at their beck and call---this is true. The doctor sometimes will step out if he has to deliver the baby of one of his patients, but as a caring doctor, you're never gonna make everyone happy. He's hard working and is really diligent in his work. I am grateful that someone referred me to him to begin with. Do NOT mistake his being quiet for him being rude. He likes to ask questions first, find out your concerns and then give you a diagnosis and answer your questions afterwards. He can't give you answers without an exam, check-up or using machines. He's highly skilled and has methods to his examinations that I have not seen from other doctors. This doctor is a good man, and an even better expert. Again, I would recommend him to any of my friends and anyone who is looking for a good doctor.< /text>

I like this clinic a lot, this is my fourth pregnancy with this doctor. The employees are super friendly and help you in everything, they answer all your questions however small. The doctor knows what he is doing, he is a perfectionist and professional, he does not speak Spanish but all the time he has an interpreter by his side, I speak English but this doctor has an accent that sometimes I do not understand one or two words of what he says. Follow up on all appointments. They have helped me solve coverage problems with my insurance, it has 2 clinics and in both they are equally friendly. In this pregnancy I thought about having the baby with a doctor just because my insurance already had that doctor, well, I said "it can go wrong if I'm going to give birth in the same hospital" I was wrong because nothing went well (you can see my review for Dr. Gandhi).
I have 29 weeks, yesterday I spoke to the clinic that they have in 1300 n vermont to see if they take my insurance, they said yes but the doctor works at the other clinic on Fridays, they gave me the address and when I arrived, they were already waiting for me, They have always had an attentive service, it makes you feel good when you are in a place with people you can trust. There are people who say "how they see you, they treat you" in this clinic no. I have seen women dressed very humble and also super well dressed and made up, they all treat the same, the saying that if I have seen that they put into practice is "the client is always right" jijiji. Because they are always very friendly, they do a good job, form a team and have always been professionals.

I am 29 weeks pregnant, yesterday I call to the clinic located on 1300 n vermont ave to see if they can take my insurance, they said yes but the doctor works in another clinic on Fridays, I got the address and when I got there they They were expecting me. They have attentive service and just makes me feel good when I'm in a place with people I can trust. This is truly a team.

Esta clinica me gusta mucho, este es mi cuarto embarazo con este doctor. Las empleadas son super amables y te ayudan en todo, contestan todas tus preguntas por pequeña que sea. El doctor sabe lo que esta haciendo, es perfeccionista y profesional, no habla español pero todo el tiempo tiene un interprete a su lado, yo hablo ingles pero este doctor tiene un acento que a veces no entiendo una o dos palabras de lo que dice. Da seguimiento en todas las citas. Me han ayudado a resolver problemas de cobertura con mi aseguranza, tiene 2 clinicas y en las dos son igual de amables. En este embarazo pense en tener al bebe con una doctora nada mas porque mi aseguranza ya tenia esa doctora, bueno, yo dije "que puede salir mal si voy a dar a luz en el mismo hospital" estaba equivocada porque nada salio bien (puedes ver mi review para la doctora Gandhi).
Tengo 29 semanas, ayer hable a la clinica que tienen en 1300 n vermont para ver si agarran mi aseguranza, me dijeron que si pero el doctor trabaja en la otra clinica los viernes, me dieron la direccion y cuando llegue, ya me estaban esperando, siempre han tenido un servicio atento, te hace sentir bien cuando estas en un lugar con personas con las que puedes confiar. Hay personas que dicen "como te ven, te tratan" en esta clinica no. He visto mujeres vestidas muy humildes y tambien super bien vestidas y maquilladas, a todas tratan igual, el dicho que si he visto que ponen en practica es "el cliente siempre tiene la razon" jijiji. Porque siempre son muy amables, hacen un buen trabajo, forman un equipo y siempre han sido profesionales.

Best chicken sandwich compaired to others. But the size of chicken legs are skimpy and family deals are expensive. KFC has better offers and bigger legs. Also my opinion. Burger King original Chicken sandwich with cheese and tomatoes which used to be called the American chicken Sandwich is the best. My opinion.</review>

Some days/nights are good, others are problematic. Incorrect orders, overcooked food, overcharged & rude employees. If you ever come across a problem, don't call them... They won't answer regardless of how many times you call. And after waiting in a long line again, they lie to you about why they didn't answer & why your order was incorrect. I've come to the conclusion things have gone downhill here & it starts with Management.<//review>

Arrived to the drive through at 9 pm.  They had no chicken and the fryers were broken.  At this point there are other cars behind me so I ordered the fish sandwich, two chicken sandwiches and a tenders meal because "all they had was sandwiches".  Get to the window and told there are no chicken sandwiches! I asked for three chocolate beignets, no go, they only had ONE apple pie.  So, I was left with half an order.  I was so frustrated I left without realizing they didn't give us the drink for the meal!  I highly suggest in the future they send someone out to the drive through to advise customers they have NO Food prior to us piling up in the drive through with no way out.</Review>

The food was good. However, the chicken sandwiches are premade, which made the mayo hot and in the process of getting crudely. The service wasn't great; they kept cutting me off and not letting me finish my order. They had a rude tone when I asked for a chicken sandwich without mayo. They're just not respectful to the customer.< /text>

After waiting 5 minutes to order I was informed they are once again out of the chicken sandwich. So I order the 5 piece chicken strip combo. Then waited another 5-10 minutes to get to the window (one car in front of us) to pay- almost $15 for one meal. So I get home (literally all the way across town) and sit down to eat to find out they have given me the wrong meal. Something I cannot eat because I don't eat meat on the bone. I ended up having to go to McDonald's (another bummer) to get my dinner. I am so disappointed and dissatisfied in this Popeyes. I have yet to have a decent meal from there, between them always being out of what I want, to them only taking cash (for whatever reason), and now them messing up my meal. I never want to go back.<//review>

<Text>Went through the drive thru and went to order Shrimp and 1 wing.

We were told they had no bone in chicken and it would be atleast an hour..... an hour? They are a chicken place?

Pulled up to the window and saw 5 employees standing around talking, including the manager.

When we asked why it would take an hour the manager said because they were slammed. When we asked how long it took to fry some chicken she told us to “have a great night”

We then asked for her name and she covered her badge and walked away..... wow obviously they don’t care about providing customer service nor do they know how to manage a rush hour shift.

Your employees are only as great as your manager.

This Popeyes definitely needs to look into who they have managing their rush hour shift!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Absolutely awful service. Ordered 20-25 minutes ahead of time with the mobile app for drive-thru pickup. After speaking to the order box, I went to the window and was told to pull up to the front of the building because the order wasn't ready yet. Waited 15 minutes there and nobody brought the food out. Went to the door (locked since the lobby is closed) and knocked several times but nobody responded or even looked up even though one employee was sitting at a table presumably on a break. Had to wait through an additional 30 minutes in the drive thru line again to get my food. Was told by another employee that I should have pulled up to the window instead of the front of the building?! Oh, and once I got my food, my receipt clearly had the description of my vehicle written at the top but nobody could've brought out my food after telling me to wait at the front? Never coming back again.</Text>

<Review>This Popeyes has very bad customer service. Please please throw the whole Popeyes away. They need to go through and just pick out half of the staff who works here because any body that stays in Vacaville knows that this Popeyes is the worst. Customer service is at a all time low here. Every time I go they are disrespectful and rude. The whole establishment is just really bad all around honestly.<//Review>< Name>

Do not even bother with their delivery services.  Ordered a family meal around 5:15pm and it says it'll take about 31 minutes. Checked the status of order around 6:30pm, app says it's being picked up by driver (John R.) with a telephone number (that is not in service).  6:50pm, order says it's in route (but without any estimates given).  6:55pm, the order on the App disappears without a trace or evidence of the order. Tried calling the establishment and nobody picks up. It's my first time ordering using their app.  It will also be the last time using their app or their business with this kind of service.  Very disappointed in them.  They have minors running the facility or something.<//Text>

I was waiting on my order and I heard the manager(blue shirt) say "5 minutes for chicken sandwich no pickles, unless your just going to take the pickles off, do you want to just take the pickles off?" My problem with that is allergies.  If someone is allergic and the pickle juice is still on the chicken sandwich that causes for an allergic reaction.  This is terrible management! Then I see an employee with gloves on go take a meal to a car come back inside then head right back into the kitchen while never changing gloves. It is a crucial time in America where covid is real. Be safe out there everyone. Popeyes, get it together. The pre-cooked pre made pre wrapped chicken sandwiches aren't good either. They get soggy in that bag!<//Review><rating>1<//rating>< username>

<text>Waited in line for 20 minutes. Finally got to the box to order and we were told they were out of chicken sandwiches and it would be 30 minutes. Bad enough to happen once but unfortunately the only consistent thing about this restaurant is their terrible customer service and inability to accurately and timely provide food.<//text><user_id>102416798629157232654< /user_id>< username>

I came here back in March and the food was normal as it always is but one of the employees made my experience top notch. She told me I looked really cool and that I was beautiful. Wish I caught her name. She was young like a teen and I think she had blonde hair. She was also really cool and beautiful. Hopefully she sees this one day <3<//review>

First moving to Vacaville i had a few issues with this place 1st time we waited forever to get our order but im sure that's what happens when you hire kids and a manager that let his crew tell him what to do.. Alot of orders were being deleted from the board because rhe young crew was overwhelmed and moving in slow motion.

2nd did a online order got there and was told they never got the order but the money had already been took from my account and i would have to call corporate to get the refund.
3rd time is similar to the 2nd time was told i can pull in front amd they would curbside got there was confronted by some lady claiming to be the manager saying they don't offer curbside pick up amd i have to go through the drive thru amd i refused because the line was all the way to the busy street again had to get a refund from corporate and come to find out the 3rd time i was charged twice.
But now i believe it's under new management ( i hope ) because it flows smooth and fast now without a screwup.< /Text>

<review>The only way that you can purchase an item is to go through the drive-through this establishment. But mind you please enter this drive through with a lot of time to spare. I guarantee you you will not be out of that drive-thru line in under 30 minutes. Yes I am sad to admit that every time I visit this establishment the wait to get to the window is over 30 minutes. Customer service is not something that you will find at this establishment so please do not go there looking for some. This place has a lot of work to do at least the food comes out correctly that's the best thing I can say< /review>< pics>

Awful service! If I could rate this zero stars I would! Lady at the drive thru tried telling me they didn’t have blackened chicken even though my husband who was in the vehicle in front of me just made that exact order!? Completely disrespectful and unnecessarily rude to me. I will not be going to this establishment again.<//text>

<Review>This location was very busy at the dinner rush. It took close to 30-45 minutes for us to get our dinner here. We just ordered 3 single serve combos. There was also no ice in the soda machine. There wasn't that many utensils left & we couldn't find ketchup for my fries. The food was good & cashier was nice though.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The manager on duty was incredibly rude. Didn't even give me a chance to ask for sauces. Cut me off several times. No napkins. No cutlery for the sides. The chicken, if you want to call it that, seemed like it was 2 days old and seemed like they fryed pure batter. Won't ever return to this location again.< /review>

<review>I dont know how a place that MAINLY sells chicken...can tell a customer there will be a 30 minute wait for chicken...not sure they know how to do their jobs at that point. Although I know it wont matter and nobody will get in trouble so this is more for anyone who goes there. Be prepared to be told they dont have the only things on their menu.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20</gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Pics>None<//Pics><review>At least 4 of the workers behind the counter were wearing masks below their noses, which really defeats the whole purpose of mask wearing. In addition, we had to wait 30 minutes for our order, which judging by other reviews seems to be a regular occurrence here.<//review>< name>

<review>I’ve been here twice and both times I’ve sat in line for 30 minutes or more . I ordered chicken sandwiches and they said I was a 20 minute wait for it I said ok that’s fine. Butttt I didn’t know they would have people wait in the line for the 20 minutes. I think it’s better if the customers pull around and park and the staff bring the food out when it’s done. Also there’s a lot of standing around of them doing nothing.< /review>< Pictures>

Worst ever service they started laughing at my name
And her name Is Lily and they should teach them to not laugh about people’s names, they were super mean when we were ordering our food and it was our first time going there and I’m disappointed, and the manager should teach them what respect is</review>

<Review>The customer service was awful. I expected a long wait, but I wish I would've never visited and don't plan to ever return. It would have been nice if the place was adequately staffed. Also would be nice for the staff to acknowledge the long wait and to inform all customers they made a decision to stop taking orders for 20 minutes so staff could "catch up". The food was good, but you can't treat customers that way. Staff needs customer service training.</Review>< response>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Had the spicy chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. Fries were so so. Wait was understandable because it was the beginning of the lunch rush and the drive thru line was long. The kitchen looked decent but the huge  problem was the dining room. It was a pig sty. Literally disgusting. The tables were filthy and regardless of where you walked the floor was sticky. There was no ice in the machine. No lids for the drinks. No napkins. Nobody made an effort to clean anything in the dining room and for that reason alone I won't be going back.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went through the drive through...ordered and paid for my food then I was directed to wait out front for 3 to 5 minutes so they could cook me fresh chicken tenders but after waiting 15 minutes I had to walk inside just to see employee's playing around as I hear them talking about my order but still not making it!! I had to get loud with the employee's after waiting another 15 minutes inside just so they would make my order!! An to top it off it was 14$ for a 5 piece chicken strip meal that only came with s handful of COLD fries!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Ordered a 3 piece and a 4piece,  on the 3 piece I got 2 wings and on the 4 piece I got 3 wings. I dropped my cellphone in the store  and when I got home called them and they said no one turned one in but I got pings from the tracker in the store till past 9 PM. The next day I got another ping and then the next ping I  got was across the street. I never found the phone.< /Review>

This is normally my go to Popeye's in Solano County but this time we were told we'd have to wait for chicken strips and for apple pie. They told us 7mins. After sitting out front for 20mins I went in to find out what was the hold up. They all acted like they had no clue then 1 girl says nobody told her the pie was done. ALL the food was cold<//review>

Usually really good but my visit tonight, we got cold hard fries 1/8 pound of shrimp when we ordered 1/4 pound (we weighed it because it looked small) And got the wrong drink given to us. The employee watched me take a sip and asked for it back and put it on the counter like she was gonna give it to the next car. And my dads "chicken strips" are more nugget sized. (Picture attached) All this after waiting for like 20 minutes after paying for the food. Sending this review to the restaurant as well.<//text>

<Text>First their system doesn't want to process a perfectly good card. I return with cash letting them know before hand that I will get cash and to have my order ready please. I have to wait in line twice and when it's my time again turns out the order wasn't made. Why not help out the situation by at least keeping the order ready. They didn't get my money today don't know when they will again</Text>< Pics>

<review>Service was Ok! Food was cold and
Dry. They are now charging 20 cents for condiments. They have went up in price recently. $24 for a #6 and a #7... Manager was trying her best to be on top of things, but I saw a few people walk out.  I feel maybe new management has taken over and have no idea on how to run a business. I will not come back. Sorry!< /review><Rating>2< /Rating>< date>

Food was delicious and friendly staff made it enjoyable. I'd give 5 stars, but the temperature inside was pretty warm in the hot weather. Manager said she'd try to fix it.</Review>

<Review>So the customer service here is horrible. I waited over 30 minutes to buy a gift card for someone but after waiting found out they dont do giftcards. I would never have waited normally but it was a special gift. The place was vastly understaffed but seem to have the volume during the pandemic to support more staff. I cant comment on the food quality as I never ordered any and based upon my visit I never will.< /Review>< Pics>

Food was good, place looked clean. I just didn't like that I ordered a 2 piece meal, and luckily I checked before I left, because the heavy set girl, think she was the manager...had put just two tiny wings in the box. I brought it to her attention and she did add a breast. Had I wanted two wings I would have bought two at like $1.78 each. But I was paying over $8.00... I am unsure as to if it was done on purpose or if it was a genuine mistake. The rice and beans I took as my side dish, I had to dump it because it smelled funky, like it was left over from the day before and was not refrigerated properly, it even looked funky.  The biscuits were nice and warm and tasty.</Text>

<date>1578070155968</date><Review>Tried the sandwich everyone's been talking about and it was very good. The line inside and outside was outrageous so I do believe they could work on being  efficient with their service in that regard. We opted to eat inside thinking it may be quicker but it did take about 30 mins to finally order. Chicken tenders didnt have taste and the shrimp was delicious as usual. Family tried mac and cheese for first time and enjoyed it. Overall decent experience due to most food ordered but the waste of time and other meals purchased gives them an okay rating overall.<//Review>< user>

We arrived at 7:32 (according to my timeline) and we stood in line inside for no less than 21 minutes before an order (which was massive) even left the kitchen. I’m assuming most people waiting inside were delivery drivers for DoorDash or GrubHub (based on the conversations I overheard) and these people would’ve had to wait to fulfill their orders anyway, but I was appalled that none of the employees acknowledged the wait at all for anyone in the lobby. A simple “sorry, for the wait everyone, it’ll be a few minutes,” or even “we have a few large orders, sorry it’s taking us a bit to get everything ready,” but there was nothing! Employees who walked past us to clean the floor and the restrooms avoided eye contact. The other customers and I kept looking at each other in disbelief of the situation. I finally followed suit of some other customers and abandoned ship. I don’t think I’ll be back this location ever again. The so-called best chicken sandwiches in the world aren’t worth experiencing that again.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Poor service, cold food, served with a big side attitude. Manager in charge when I visited had one of those kind of attitudes where u order and she is all teeth clenched "yes ma'am", super tension induced interaction mixed with negative vibes all the way. She got half my food ready, and stopped, (assuming the busy team would handle the rest, I guess) and then went on talking ish about customers wanting dipping sauce. Which she ended up just GIVING THEM after all of her drama. Yet, easily charged me 2 seconds after... Not that I mind paying for it. Its just the principle of the matter.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

They try. It's new, and crowded, but they try their best. Chicken is good and nicely made. The people that come in are skeptical but hey they love chicken lol. No drive through. Would have given 4 stars if there was a drive through<//text>

Well, it's no Roscoe's. But it's better then KFC.
Really tho, it was pretty tasty fried chicken, so I can't criticize much.

What do Popeyes and me have in common?

Read online that Popeyes had the best chicken sandwich of all chains. I went yesterday and was told they were out of pickles. That can happen, so I left. Today I ordered a chicken sandwich with extra pickles. After 30mins... received chicken sandwich...no extra pickles? Not 'Impressed'!< /text>

Took 20-30 minutes to go through the drive thru. Said meal only comes with one sauce and you have to pay for another one, but on my receipt it says qty 2 no sauce... and I asked for butter and honey and only got honey. Employees are rude also. Won't be back.</review>

Waited 15 minutes, behind two men who had been waiting even longer and none of us were greeted or got service.  I think they were going through some personal drama. 12 minutes in, the manager apologized, but gave no explanation and no one (including her) stepped up to serve us.  After several more minutes, I bailed and so did several others in line.  Bad, bad, bad.< /review>

Waited in the drive thru today for a chicken sandwich meal with a Medium diet coke. The cashier repeated my order and mistakenly said regular coke. I corrected her twice that is needs to be a diet coke. I get to the window expecting what I ordered, and ended up with a regular coke with cold fries and a chicken sandwich that was poorly put together. This place really needs to step up their customer service big time.</text>

That had to be the worst experience ever in a fast food restaurant. 3 people working behind the counter,  at least 8 people in line.  Waited 15 min to have my order taken.  Then almost 30 min later, they never drop the fish in the fryer.  Finally get my food and I'm told the didn't have any tartar sauce.  Told the lady, if it wasn't so busy I would demand my money back.  Everyone in the restaurant was complaining  to each other.   I should know better, this location has always had really slow service.  Always under manned. Probably be quite a while until I return!<//review>

Horrible. Waited 25 minutes in front of Popeyes. Went inside another 5 minutes. Finally got to the front and asked for my money back. Manager never tried to offer a remorseful apology. Never offered a discount or comp part of the launch. Bratty girl from drive thru then had the nerve to say our order just came out. Regular chicken while countless others were served. Sorry. Had to go to chic filet. Never any drama there. Vacaville Popeyes is off limits.<//Text>

I just stood in line for 30 minutes so my family to try this chicken sandwich. Then I was rudely told but I'm only allowed 2 sandwiches.. I got 6 to feed. Both as a cashier and manager were extremely rude. I asked why they didn't notify everybody in line that there is a limit. I realized there's a lot of people wanting these sandwiches. But this has been going on for WEEKS there's no reason that people are standing in line for that long and not being notified  that there's NEW RULES a as to ensure that you're not wasting customer time. There should be a big sign out front that says only two sandwiches per order. Both the cashier and the manager were extremely rude about the situation. Not to mention the staff behind the counter were extremely slow. Putting around and had absolutely no concern that there was a huge line. Not to mention they have the drive-thru closed. And just closed it by putting a car in the drive thru so everybody's pulling in thinking it's a line. The manager clearly has no business managing anything to do with customer service..< /Review>

Got there at opening to try the chicken sandwich that has been in news all week bcuz it's so popular. Waited at drivethru for 15+ minutes and only 3 cars ordered and moved forward and there was still 5 cars between myself and order speaker. I decided I would go inside and stand in line instead. There were 8 people in line ahead of me and 4 people off to side that were waiting for their order. There were a number of employees working behind counter, including a manager. After 15 minutes in this line, only 3 people had placed their order and they all were for 1 to 3 chicken sandwiches, so I left after deciding that I could not afford to waste as much time in line as it seemed it was going to take. My question is this: if you know that you have a sandwich that is so popular that you are getting nationwide media attention over it, wouldnt you make at least a small batch of them before you open and have them ready? I dont understand how you need 5+ minutes per customer to take each order. Incidentally, each person's order that I saw filled, inside and in drivethru (which i could see through window while i was inside) was only one bag.</Review>

This place surprised the heck outta me!  It was chosen by my date, who lives in San Jose.  They have everything you need for a good night out all in one spot!  Good drinks, good food, good ppl and good music!  Must go again.  They also have an outdoor space and you can watch the games there as well.< /text>

LOVE their food! And their $5 daily specials are just the right size to fill you up. This location was severely understaffed to the point that it looked like the employees were having to choose between filling orders quickly (which they weren't, even though the employees were clearly scrambling to fill them) and cleaning tables/maintaining the place. Because of this, they were out of lids at the drink area (which wasn't filled even after we told them within the 45 minutes or so we were there) and there was a huge package of napkins on the front counter that guests were expected to help themselves to. No tables were cleaned during our visit, even though they were used many times.

Despite all this, over all the appearance of the restaurant was good compared to many fast food places in the area.<//Text>

I always get the week special on the bucket chicken. There really good with me. Most of them don't know about it. They always take the time to find out what I'm talking about. So I get a great deal.< /Review>

I ordered my food, staff prepared it, and the person who appeared to look like the shift manager brought my food to the window and turned around to do something else. As I waited for another 5 mins, the person who appeared to be the shift mgr told the person who took my order to give me my food.
I don't understand why she couldn't have just open the dang window and gave it to me?!?!
Other then that, we still enjoyed our meal.

I rarely review, if ever. While the employees were pleasant and cordial, the service was very slow, but this was not the real issue at hand. The real issue was the food. It was not good. Actually quite awful. I don't plan to ever eat at a Popeyes again.< /text>

< review>
I'm very disappointed in this particular Popeyes. The service at this place is terrible. They are very slow and the chicken is not being served to the standards that I know Popeyes to be. I was born and raised in NOLA and am very familiar with the brand. You take your chances going through the drive thru. I don't know if it's because they're understaffed or not. I was in there the other day and the only one waiting to order. The staff (and someone who appeared to be the mgr) just looked at me as they put other orders together for drive thru and perhaps others. I didn't get a, "We'll be right with you sir," or nothing. One who seemed to be a cashier just looked at me and didn't say a word. After approx 10 min I just left. Maybe because they don't have a financial stake in the business they don't care about customer service. If I buy the place, I'll start off with a whole new crew.< /review>

<Review>They are far and in between where I live. I always enjoy the food but service sometimes suffers. Last time I was there I was waited on and was the only customer. After 20 minutes of no food I went up to the counter, and they forgot my order. It was annoying because the food is already made.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80853d2cd922e9eb:0xedb51cdaffb74e20</GmapID></record>

Chicken was floppy not crunchy.. Shrimp had to much breading.. Normally love this place but this location was a flop... Bummed no freestyle coke machine as other locations have. Biscuit was good and mashed potatos were good.</Review>

I was really disappointed with my experience. I waited 17 minutes for my meal and got nipped on chicken size. My boyfriend waited even longer and after 19 mins they told us they ran out of fries. And his favorite dipping sauces. It would have been nice to know earlier. But the chicken is still great!</Text>

<text>OK, I've got a Jones for Popeye's spicy chicken. I used to like their catfish, but they took it off the menu years ago. Biscuits and fries are very good too. But don't tell my cardiologist.  I stop here for lunch when I'm driving by, which is once or twice a year. I'd be dead if I did it more often.</text><user_name>Jim Brown<//user_name>< time>

< Review>
I love Popeye's, but the service at this place was terrible. All the employees looked like they didn't want to be there. I tried to order a special they were supposed to be having, but the cashier said it didn't exist anymore (even though it was posted on the window), and she didn't even apologize for the inconvenience or anything. None of the employees smiled and when I asked for condiments, they threw them at me across the counter. The tables weren't even clean and they even messed up my friend's order. It was just a flat out disappointing experience.<//Review>

What kind of primary chicken fast food place. Runs out or chicken sandwiches at 530pm. After waiting in the drive through I was told they would have chicken sandwiches for several hours.  Bad management and planning.  Ended up driving down the street to Chick-fil-A,  they never run out of sandwiches.<//review>

I left without food after 20 minutes in drive thru with only 2 people ahead of me. Why, the spicy chicken strips me and car #1 ordered not ready. 1) you should have said that (I only found out by honking and finally someone came out) and I would've just ordered plain!!! 2) how fricking long does it take to make chicken tenders? After 20 minutes when I left no one had received their food! 3) I would expect Popeyes - A CHICKEN FAST FOOD PLACE would have their most popular menu item attainable at 2:30pm on a Saturday. *SERIOUS INCOMPETENCE*<//Text>

<review>They have a worker named “Maddy” and she was an absolute pleasure! She let me take my time to order without any attitude and catered to my needs (i always have a hard time to ordering food for some odd reason its like every thought slips my mind). Nicest worker ive ever met anywhere i swear. I’ll definitely go back. Plus my food was hot not old at all. If i could give 10 stars i would. Thank you Maddy!< /review>< time>

I used to love Popeyes in Vacaville until about six months ago,  it seems like they had a complete staff change.  The chicken is a little different and the customer service is horrible. This is just my opinion over the last 6-8 months<//review>

Chicken was always good when dined in.  They would give stale chicken the few times that I ordered for to-go even during lunch and dinner hours.  And dining area wasn't always clean.<//text>

<user>111650246775984930591</user>< review>
Went through the drive thru last night and got piss poor service. I ordered the $10 meal they told me they only had spicy chicken and I would have to wait ten minutes. I pulled around and waited. The girl that took the order was high as a kite was the same young lady that brought my order it to me. The order was wrong and she brought out three thighs three drumsticks and a wing (Spicy). I ordered a 5 piece meal  (mild) not 7 piece spicy. Ask for the manager to come out and talk with me, she came out with a wing and biscuit and said she gave you more than what you ask for and put her hands all over the chicken!!! Then went back in and got me a breast. Not knowing that the chicken in the first box was Spicy till I got home after waiting ten minutes for them to cook the mild ones, very disappointed. Called the manager there next day and all she said was what's your address and I'll send you a card to use the next time I come in. I want my 💰 back and I won't ever eat at this establishment again</review>

<Review>My order was wrong and as I was out of town when I got home correcting it was not an option. Check your order. Chicken and seafood we're all overcooked. Really not happy and won't return. It was not a standard order either which would lend to more attention and paid more for certain pieces... And none of it was correct.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< date>

< Review>
Got to drive thru at 10:20pm 7/9/17 and was not served. Even though I saw customers inside and employees standing around. If you guys close earlier then change your hours. It saids you close at 10:30pm All I wanted was a side of fries. Not like that would have taken long to make if not already made.  Extremely dissatisfied. Drove across town for nothing.<//Review>

Every time we go through the drive thru my order is wrong. It's pointless to try. We ordered12 pc tenders and came home wirh legs, thighs and breast last time. Very annoying and a waste of time.< /review>

<review>I like their food, but service can take awhile, at least at this location. I usually leave if there's more than a couple of people ahead of me because of it, but even when it's not busy, it can be a wait. Waited 12 minutes (looked at order time on receipt) today for chicken tenders.<//review>< Pics>

Worst customer service I've experienced on drive through, she told me to wait I waited literally 8 minutes with other customers behind me waiting I pulled ahead I no longer wanted their service the car behind me did the same thing, it was only one car in front of us it was all bad still waited 8 extra minutes, that drive through service is bad and don't recommend it..< /Text>

Went through drive thru. Ordered 4 things but was asked to pull around because the biscuits weren't ready. After waiting, food was brought out. No drink that was ordered. No butter for the biscuits. No plastic spoons or forks. No receipt. I don't see even one star's worth of review.<//text>
