I had a $25 gift certificate from this place so I decided to use it. My masseuse and the manager followed me to my car demanding a tip. They said from the beginning that it was fine to use the certificate. I won’t go back. Don’t bother coming here unless you want more stress from them chasing you to your car demanding a tip and cussing in their language at you. 0 stars< /review>

This is one of the best places to come if you want a really well priced massage for an hour!! Only $25!! I highly recommend it! I never leave unsatisfied! They have mints and water in the waiting area as well!< /text>

First time and I will be back. I was pleasantly surprised with just how good this massage was. I paid a little extra to get a private room as I am 9 months pregnant and it was worth evey penny. I've been in pain not be able to sleep for 2 nights and I feel so much better. I'm sure I will get a good night sleep tonight!</review>

This review is more directed at the person doing the massage than at Super Relax. I had LuLu and she not only didn't know anything about where and what to do but she left me laying there for more than 5 minutes in the middle of the massage.  She literally rubbed oil over and in my eyes causing them to burn.  She was ask to do a firm massage and the only time she was firm was when she was stabbing her elbows into my bones....not my muscle but my bones which is not super relaxing but super painful.
I felt like it is such an inexpensive massage that I shouldn't expect much and I kept laying there hoping it would just get a little better.
It got worse and you couldn't pay me to let her touch me again.
I've been to this place and have had good massages in the past but I would recommend staying away from Lulu.<//text>

<Date>1547594333821</Date><text>My daughter told me about Super Relax after she found it online while here visiting me in the valley. She booked 1.5 hour massage with " Leo", who she said reallly knows his stuff. Apparently he is the main guy who books the more private sessions (which is  basically a small space seperated from rest of area by a curtain). It costs ten dollars more i believe.
When we went together, we walked in and, although they were fully scheduled for that (Saturday) evening, the kind man in the front didnt turn us away but instead, asked us to see what he could do a d after their 8 oclock didnt show up, he allowed us to stay for an hour massage.
My first massage here was pretty "intense"; I was alloted a male masseuse who was a bit too rough in technique, to the point where i had to interupt the flow and ask that he go a bit easier. I tell this because I am one to enjoy deep tissue massage and therefore dont mind a little pain w my therapeutic massages; in fact I prefer a bit of digging and manipulating. But this particular time I found it not on point- more like poking into my spine w sharp elbows way too hard.
Anyway, the second time I mysef went w my sister, we phoned in for an appt on a Sunday afternoon and requested we both have female masseuses.
And I had a lady named Linda who was absolutely terrific! She knew right where my sore and tight muscles were without a word and I walked out of there feeling like a million bucks.
I have sciatica so when I get flare ups, it requires rapid relief and Linda fit the bill.
And the bill??
Well, you certainly cannot beat $25 for an entire hour!
Well worth every penny.
Just be sure to tip generously as these masseuses work very hard and thus benefit from xtra tippage for jobs well done!
Oh, and one more thing, be sure you wear comfortable and baggy pants or leggings and for the ladies, skip the underwire bras and or high maintenance undergarments.
(They have you keep your pants on and shirts off).
I highly recommend this place!</text></record>

Massage place should be relaxing but this place is far away from it. There was a guy snoring n farting right next to me,u can hear all the convo,phn calls from the receptionist. And the receptionist was not polite either. I'll say he just didn't know how to behave. Wanted to try that place,tried it...and NEVER going back. Specially won't recommend if u r looking for some relaxaing,refreshing time.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

But as i entered the massage area it was overpacked, was not feel clean and the towles i was laying on was wet!! So most probably they do reuse their towels! The lady who massaged me was also rushing thru the process and most of the time she kept going back and forth wasting time..i would not recommend this place. Been to many more foot massages by far i would say this was the worst experience. Oh and they charge you right when you walk in so you dont run away haha.<//Review>< pictures>

First time visitors here and this is my experience,  right off the bat the guy in the front (owner)? Asked to pay before service was provided. After entering, a stink of sweat and god knows what threw my mood off, come on insents are so cheap, even a cheap 20$ vaporizer can change the smell of this small place, my wife was given a male therapist and she asked for female so when we asked to switch these two starting going off in thier language, (rude).  Now the towels 30 different colors and worn out and some with cartoon prints, COME ON!  towls are so cheap at ikea and china town etc.. Invest a lil and get better tips and more returning clients.  Now for the massage it self u get 20 bucks worth im not gona complain about that with these kind of places its always a hit and miss.</Review>

Usually get good service but today I went in there after checking in online, wasn't greeted when I walked in so I sat down and waited for them to finish up the cuts they were working on. When they finished they took two people up and then finally greeted me for the first time and asked if I had checked in. I had, but it didn't show up on the system. If they would've greeted me when I walked in I would've known that they were wasting my time, and that I was sitting in there for no reason, but they didn't. When I checked in there wasn't anyone in front of me so I wasn't about to wait for four people for no reason and I left. That's not customer service and this is the kind of stuff that turns people away for good when there are so many other options in town. Thanks for nothing.< /text>

If anyone wants a butchered up hair job, please feel free to come here. I have curly hair so it was kind of expected, but I really was desperate enough to get my hair short. The lady who did my hair cut too much off for one thing and thankfully she insisted on not giving me a shorter haircut that would classify as "a boy's hair cut," after politely pointing out that it was a bit (quite a lot)  uneven to begin with.  She clearly didn't know what she was doing, since any person with experience should know that every curly hair is different.. especially black hair. I had my hair up all day in a bun and when I take it down, it appears straighter than it's natural curly state since I am mixed and my mom's straight hair gene makes my hair easier to manipulate..She even decided to put some "curly hair" in-store products in my hair to "style" my hair... Only thing it did was make my hair flaky. She was nice enough to wash my hair, but cut then cut more while it was wet. -_- I got a refund for the haircut, but couldn't get the $6 tip (for my mom and my haircut) back since the manager wasn't there. I'm so glad I found somebody better, a bit pricey, but worth my humiliation I had to put up with. I like the great clips on MacArthur for my husband, but never again will I go cheap on my hair again!! Guess they give just about anybody a certificate no matter how crappy the job was.< /text>

Last weekend, I checked in online before driving a half hour from where I currently live, to get a hair cut for my son.   When I arrived, the staff scurried to the back of the shop like a bunch of rats and when I got close enough to the door to read the sign, I saw they were closing early.  No phone call letting me know after I checked in online.   No acknowledgement when I was standing outside the shop.  No gratification that I had passed no fewer than 4 Great Clips locations driving across town to be a loyal customer.</Text>< Pictures>

There might be 1 or 2 good people here, but the rest are mediocre at best. Their idea of giving a haircut to a male is to just give your head a few very quick passes with a clipper, no scissors or anything. The result is going home and finding that the clipper missed hair so you've got a bunch of stray long hairs and getting someone else to fix it....</Review>

<review>Worst. I told the girl Amy I needed my hair thinned out as much as possible. She said okay and thinned out some but when I had asked for more she said that's all she can do. I explained to her that I know that I'll have little ends sticking out but I wanted more because I knew what felt good to me when I as going to curl my hair. Well I left it at that and regret giving her a tip.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I’m regular customer here. I bring my 4 year old son for a haircut every other week. My last visit was horrible!! I got Sarai and from the beginning she was being so rude and had a miserable look on her face. My son hardly moves he just finds it ticklish when using the machine. But still stays still and moves very little. She has no patience and told my son that if he dindt stay till that “she was going to cut a whole piece of his hair off”. After I had asked her to make a line on side of my son hair and she kept sayimg she couldn’t because her machine wasn’t cutting it. I had told her that I come here all the time and get the same haircut. Her response was “ everyone has different machines here”. She asked the other hairstylist I believe her name is Alexandra. She told her that she has the same machine that she was using. She still said her machine couldn’t cut his hair. To top it off she did a horrible job cutting his hair. Very very disappointed and will not be going ask back. If you don’t like your job look for a new one as well new equipment!<//Review>

First time being here and there was 4 of us. My nails turned out to look amazing, however my sisters nails which was done by someone else,  mine were done by the owner, looked awful there are air bubbles and the acrylic is uneven. They look horrible but then both my nieces look good. So I still give them 5 stars<//review>

Phillip, his wife Teresa and their staff are awesome. Recently celebrated their third anniversary after he branched off from another salon. He knows every returning customer by name. Knows what you like and knows how to takes care of you. Highly recommended.<//review>

< Review>
I've never really gotten my nails done before but I decided to get mine and my sister's done before school started back up. Dreamy Nails was a perfect choice for me, over the phone they were amazing at helping me understand my different options, and quick and easy to make an appointment with. Got there maybe 10 minutes early for our appointment and was immediately sat down for my gel manicure. Lots of color choices and the people were friendly. My nails looked amazing in the end, the only thing I would maybe take like half a star for would be that when she was filing the edges of my nails when she finished, she filed at the edges of my skin and they hurt some later in the day. Overall great, and Benny the salon dog is so cute!</Review>

Extremely rude, extremely unprofessional. Poor work, very unclean, this place will give you a infection. Do not go here. As a matter of fact I didn't even see a license posted anywhere. Every nail tech should have a license posted. The health department needs to shut this place down.< /review>

Phillip and Theresa, a wonderful husband and wife team, and their little dog Benny made me feel like part of their family. It was my first time there and my nails were destroyed by the last place I went. They both took their time with me, repairing my nails and giving me a new set. Phillip is an artist! He created a design and gave me exactly what I was looking for. The other patrons were seemingly happy with their service and said they would be back. I highly recommended this wonderful place!</Text>

Probably one of the cleanest nail salons I've been too. Always smells good everything is very nice. They have all the same colors for gel and normal nail polish which is great variety for both! It's my new "Nail place" for sure.</Review>

New salon for me that I've used 3x with the same wonderful lady. Today I had someone else who completely destroyed my nails!! I told her what I wanted (which is super simple) and she contined to shape them unevenly & taper the hell out of them! I'm so angry with the horrible service I received today!! She didn't even listen to what I wanted.</Review>

<text>I'm very disappointed with my experience at this nail salon. I went in today, fully expecting a wait as I did not have an appointment. I was told to pick a color and asked to wait. They took the two women who were waiting before me and a woman who came in who said she had an appointment. I continued to wait.
Then a couple walked in, the staff apologized for the wait and asked them to come back in 1/2 an hour. Then a young blonde came in and she too was told that they didn't want her to have to wait and asked her to come back in 1/2 hour. After waiting (alone) in the waiting area for nearly 30 minutes and watching customers told to come back I asked would I be seen soon. I was shocked when I was asked to come back in a FULL hour.
I'm not sure how the staff made sense of asking me to wait, not giving me the same courtesy they gave to the other patrons and THEN ask me to come after they finished those who came in after me. Again, I'm disappointed that the staff felt comfortable dismissing me.
I hope they don't continue to pick and chose their customers. Please respect the time and money of ALL customers.</text>< Pictures>

Hit and miss, depending on who you get or if you're treated as a VIP? Had my mani/pedi done here as a bride Nov '17 and had fine service and a nice set of nails with a very personable staff member. Would have given 5 stars if not for my recent visit which deserves a 1 star rating. =( I came back in as a regular customer now and ended up with a poorly done pedicure, and way less time spent on it than the other ladies I came in with who had the same Classic pedicure who were started on at the same time.  The person working on me just seemed to be focused on getting it done a quickly as possible and moving on to the next client. The nail clipping job left jagged edges and wasn't properly filed down. The following day after a shower the gel polish is already coming off. She also painted over the cuticles and now it's chipping at the cuticle line. Really disappointed, especially since it cost $50 bucks. I'll try a different salon next time.< /Text>

Larry did my full set of nails today. Im a licensed nail tech. So naturally I can be picky but he did a fantastic job. Shape was great, very gentle. He paid close attention to detail. I haven't had anyone else do my nails since I got licensed over 3 years ago but I was very pleased. The service was great, salon very clean and well kept, I will definately be back!<//Review>

<review>My best friend was in town, so we decided to get pedicures. The lady that did mine was terrible!!! My best friend and I both picked a glitter polish.. Her guy helped her pick a base color.. My lady said nothing and Just painted on the glitter.. Ok.. So I look down at my toes(she's already moved on to the next client) and only half of my nails were painted.. The guy doing my friends nails heard me.. And told her to come back and fix them.. Ok great.  It's all said and done we pay and leave.. Were back at our rental house and I notice that 4of the 10 nails have completely chipped off.. Were taking like 4hrs after .. They really shouldn't be chipping off. So I go back when they open the next morning.. The lady who had done them the previous day was there.. So I showed her the problem.. Ok she agrees to fix it. . she starts talking about how she used three coats of paint.. And it should have been ok.. So I mention that the guy who did my friends used an under coat then the glitter and finished with a clear coat.. She then says "ok I'll do better" so she actually picked a base color and re did them correctly.. But then I felt like the enitre time I was there.. They were bad mouthing me in their language.. So if you want a crappy pedicure.. And to be talked about. Then go here... If not .. Go ANYWHERE else!!! I'll never go back. Rude!!! Although Benny was cute and the man that works there is hilarious!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

No one there seemed to understand any of my questions or requests, and do to the language barrier and communication issues I was grossly over charged and the gel polish they used peeled off my toe nails after my first hot shower, very disappointing considering the $45 they charged me. The gel was put on overly thick on both mine and my moms toes. All in all it was a bad experience and we will never be going back.</Review>

I was in and out in 30 minutes with 4 brand new tires with a great great price of 480.00 which is an amazingly good deal for me and my truck.. I have 20 inch rims so for me to find 4 brand new tires for that price. I had to jump on it. It was a steal<//Text>

Called at 6:30 day before closing confirmed size, price and time to come in first thing in the morning. When I get there stated that the tires I need were sold at 7 night before and if I want to order going to be $100 more than advertised price a few hours earlier. Beware of bait and switch pricing<//text>

Got me a brand new tire for a great price. Wasn't greedy but honest and before I bought he filled all my tires just to be helpful. Places like this you make your only source.<//review>

Truly experienced comfort when it came to letting them work on my car (my baby) not overly tightening my lugnuts, I rather see the cross pattern applied when torquing the wheels but ita ok it wasn't a gorilla installing them.  And that matters when you spend 2500 on rims and tires.</Review>

<Text>Girl got a flat. Other tires were still ok. Went to buy a used tire and installation. Super fast was in and out within 15 minutes. Good price too. Only one car ahead of me.

<Text>This place is ok. The guys are really friendly. They have both new and used tires, but I haven't really seen if they carry the big 5 brands, mostly the economy brands in new tires. They do have tons of very good quality used tires though! I've been going to them for quite a few years now. They are good for tires only though. No wheels or lug nut service.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>If i can give them negative stars i would, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM, they are unprofessional, no custoner service, and liars. i ordered my tires monday morning they told me it was going to be there after 4pm,  called them up they said it wasn't there,  told me to come back tuesday after 1, same thing happened, they told me come back Wednesday after 1230, same thing still no tires. Plus everytime i called they said let me check my delivery and i will call you back in 10mins, not once did they call me back. i had to call them atleast 3 times a day. felt like they were tryong to avoid me, and no on wanted to take responsibility. PLEASE DO NOT SHOP FOR TIRES HERE. YOU WILL REGRET IT.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Perfect location right off of the freeway! The storage unit is well maintained and secured, I always felt safe coming by myself at any time to drop things off to storage or pick things up. They have good pricing and the office is very helpful and always pleasant to talk to. I’ve used quite a few different storage units in town and I would definitely recommend these guys.</Review>

I highly recommend this storage facility. Not only is Chico U-Lock-It one of the only storage facilities in the area who actually bothers answering their phone, they quickly helped me out when I needed a storage unit last minute. Lisette got me set up without any hassles and I was loading my stuff into my new storage unit an hour after I called them. Thank you Lisette for being so efficient, professional, and accommodating! I will be sure to use your facility again in the future when needed.<//text>

<review>While waiting for an apartment to open up, I had to put my stuff in storage and needed to get access to my spot frequently for important items. Because mine was indoors I would have to get the key to access it and that process was quick and easy to do. The lady at the front desk is always kind and courteous.

They are also well priced compared to other storage companies in the area.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><user>117128128162575467829< /user><Time>1582920217887</Time></record>

I have nothing but problems. office closes at 5pm so why at 4pm am I being told I only have 10 minutes. I have an inside hallway locker so gate time doesn’t matter when you have to go into the office to get the key so you can get to the locker. But the office closes whenever they feel like. Office is closed Sundays so can’t get to your locker if you have an inside one.They always have gate problems.< /Review>

I never had nor heard of anything being stolen from the facility. The price that they gave me for outside storage was fantastic (55$) compared to other options in Chico. I would recommend their facility to anyone with a RV, boat, trailer, 5th wheel, or even just a storage locker. Someone is always on sight in the office to answer phone calls or if you have question while on the property.< /Text><Time>1583377974217<//Time><userid>117016484315225822744< /userid></record>

Staff is super helpful and easy to work with. Units are very well maintained and super clean. Easy to find location and fully secured. Prices are great and gate hours are great. Would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a storage unit.< /Text>

I have been a customer of Chico U Lock It Self Storage for over a year now and have always been incredibly pleased by the cleanliness and convenience of the facility and, more importantly to me, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. They are always very kind and helpful and I very much appreciate them. I would absolutely recommend using this facility for your storage needs.< /Text>

< Review>
I unfortunately found myself in a storage crisis at the beginning of December & U-Lock-It self storage was able to accommodate my immediate need for storage.  Based off the items I described, the manager was able to give me a size that would fit all my items.  She sure knows her storage lockers as all my stuff fit perfectly!

She thoroughly explained everything to me, helped me find a lock for my unit & even walked me over to where my unit was located.  One night, while I was stopping by to pick up a few things, I couldn't get the gate to open ( turns out there's a trick to the darn thing.) The manager stopped what she was doing to come to the door after hours & explain the trick is to head straight at it.

If I ever find myself in a storage crisis again, I know exactly where I'm going.</Review>

<Review>Absolutely the best storage unit experience I’ve had. The front desk was so kind and friendly. She was able to answer all my questions. Explained everything in detailed and was able to assure me what would be charge and how much. I was looking for a storage the day of and called everywhere in town. It was difficult to find one at a good price since all college students took over but Chico-U-lock it was there for me. I greatly appreciate them and all the customer service they provided for me.</Review>< pics>

We searched other storage facilities in Chico and this is the best we found!  The lanes are wide enough to get a truck through with no problem and the entire place is as clean as a whistle! When I opened my new storage space I was impressed by the cleanliness of the locker. Everyone that works there is polite and kind. I had an issue trying to get into my locker the first day and they were there immediately to help me out!<//text>

The Management is not Clear on their Policy. They didn’t ever indicate there is a 30 Day Notice you have to give. I cleaned and took my lock before payment was due. I had let her know it was cleaned she had me sign a paper saying I was moved out said nothing about paying for the 30 days. Now I receive a bill for late fees and god only knows what else. When I rented I indicated that I would only need it for the month, for stuff being stored from my sisters burned house. Be careful people they are very sneaky.<//text>

<Text>If I could give it negative stars, Iwould have. I don't know if the very rude, and unkind lady that works and lives in the apartment is the owner, but if she isnt i hope you see this, i i hope she sees this too. Not only are you holding my stuff hostage, but also threatened us with calking cops. We haven't brokbr any laws, callincalli out for being a rude and unkind person, all for what you did the paper work wrong. Its not our fault you cant do your job correctly, also diddid stop us from coming a few dozen times with also help.  If I have to I  will call the sheriff's office for a civil stand by, if you do not give us access to our stuff within 24 hours, after that ill sue you. Great way to treat us camp fire survivors. If the owner sees this please contact me id be really interested in knowing why you hired such a repulsive person</Text><user_name>shardae wood</user_name><Time>1552522554576</Time><user_id>115832130055963837647</user_id><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808327d538da1da7:0x97964db3f41c05a2</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The management is so bad and they have no regard for anyone whether or not you rent a storage space there.  and it certainly is in one of the worst locations ever because it takes so long to get through the 20th street intersection.  We have been renting two units from them for 11 months now and we have had one thing after another come up causing us grief and wishing we never rented from them at all.  the so called manager decided to 'restrict' our gate access because she had accused us of "smoking excessively and leaving cigarette butts everywhere" except we DO NOT SMOKE.  When the gate restriction really began to negatively effect us we tried to get her to change it back and she claimed it was now beyond her control and when we said we hadn't even done what she said, she changed 'smoking' to 'eating'...so apparently we were eating cigarettes excessively and leaving the butts everywhere?? she changed our gate code without telling us on three separate occasions for no apparent reason, and she harrasses us constantly when ever we are there.  Whenever we have tried to talk to her about anything she threatens us with a 30 day notice.  THIS PLACE IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST REGRETS, and i would recommend someone to sell all their belongings before renting here.<//review><time>1546047413470<//time><user>107500570959101824343<//user>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I have read the one previous review and feel it must have been written by a family member of the owner.
I have been with Chico U Lock It for about 8 months and it has been a hell ridden nightmare.  The management from top to bottom is the most incompetent I have ever encountered in any realm or level of business.  The gate sign reads that during the summer  the gate closes at 8 PM.  After several visits to my storage unit the gate was chronically closed before 8 PM.  I complained to the management and they said that summer didn't begin until June 21, the summer equinox...OK!  With this in mind I tried to access my unit after 21 June before 8 PM and the gate would still be closed early.  They said that the gate closed by computer and the time set to close the gate could be wrong.  They never corrected it as I had multiple incidents thereafter where the gate was again closed early.  My latest incident was about 3 weeks ago when I was at the gate at 7:50 and it was closed.  I needed 5 minutes access to my unit get get something that a person was driving 8 hours to pick up.  I was able to rouse the site manager and she refused me access even though the gate was closed early and a person was wasting an 8 hour drive.  She told me that "they" were now closing the gate at 7 PM, even though it is still summer; the spring equinox is 21 September and summer ends.  I was then told that all renters were notified by e-mail, but they didn't have my e-mail so I wasn't notified.  They had my mailing address and my telephone number, plus I filled out their application and gave all information requested.  If the e-mail wasn't requested on the application it was heir fault.  I complained to who the site manager said was the owner.  "The owner"  became enraged at me complaining and said I was there after 7 PM.  My reply was that I had a telephone record, where a call to the resident manager was made, which showed 6:50.  At this he went into a screaming tirade and issued me an immediate 30 day eviction notice, whic arrived at my house, hand delivered w/i 12 hours. (note he couldn't find a means to notify me of the new gate hours)  When I threatened a lawsuit to review he matter the "owner" told me to join the long line of others suing him and that his storage area was private property and I had absolutely no rights there.  He said the contract says so.  Thereafter I read the contract, which was too log to read when I filled out the application.  To my dismay he was right; the contract is written so tightly that renters have zero rights no matter what the incident is.  All applicants sign away all common rights.  I tried to get into my unit yesterday and my gate combination wouldn't work.  I walked into the office and the resident manager said I hadn't paid my monthly rent.  I told her that I was in during the first weekend of the month to pay and the weekend manager told me it was paid.  I described the weekend manager, someone I'd never seen there before, but my pleas went onto deaf ears.  I was charged a late fee abd a $15.00 fee for the delivery of the eviction letter described above.  The site of the facility is handy, the security good, but all else beyond horrible and an "owner" that came across to me as demonic in nature with absolutely zero customer relations experience.<//text>< Pictures>

Gate times were the worse I've ever seen, the people working there are rude and you need a headlamp to see anything if your unit is in the corridors. I moved out to go to a different storage facility and they tried to charge me for a cleaning fee even though I left my unit spotless. I gave them a 30 day notice and they sent me a bill for an additional month because my 30 day notice ended a few days into the next month. So they wanted me to pay for a unit that was vacant for almost 60 days. They take advantage of people in a hurry who are stressed out because they are moving. Horrible< /text>

This is the only storage place in Chico with staff service on SUNDAY. When I moved to Chico, staff reserved a large space for me to rent over the phone and were open on Sunday with paperwork for me to move in. The office has to be open for me to access my unit, but the staff are always kind and courteous.</review>

<Review>Chico U-LOCK IT has the worst customer service now. Ever since the bike riding bimbo has started there has been nothing but problems. She is very rude, arrogant, and disrespectful. She falsely accuses customers of being an annoyance and irritant. My family has rented from this same place for over 30 years. NOT ANYMORE< /Review>< rate>

They won't let you store anything unless you have a pg&e bill for proof of  residency . Sucks if you are looking for a place to live and don't want to travel around driving with your luggage . They don't care if you are staying with someone,  if you don't have proof of residency you are screwed at this place. Not nice:(  I would give them no stars!😡< /Text>

<Text>I just wanted to reach out and relay my sincere gratitude for gobusinessplans.com and their awesome job putting together our business plan. I received my final approval for our SBA 7a loan last week and we are finally moving forward to open our first business, The Grape & Grain - Fine Wines and Craft Beer.

The final business plan was very attractive and informative but the financial portion really showed that we had properly planned for any and every outcome and it easily allowed me to expand on portions quickly and make adjustments seamlessly. I even had questions months after our agreement finalized and the team at gobusinessplans.com didn’t hesitate to help.

We are now on track to open “The Grape & Grain - Purveyor of Fine Wines and Craft Beer” by Christmas 2020!

Thanks again!

Very professional. Committed to excellence, going above and beyond to make their clients happy. Very passionate, you can tell that they love what they do. Which is helping their clients realize their dream. I was very impressed with Deirdre's attention to detail, uncanny ability to think outside the box, and willingness to accept even greater challenge, and still remains committed to deliver nothing but excellence. And she did all that calmly and gracefully. I am very thankfull for the hard work and commitment they showed from start to end to complete the work successfully. Great job guys! Keep up the good work.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I am very happy with my decision to hire Go Business Plans (Business Plan Writers) to help me finish my startup Business Plan.

From start to finish, the process happened as planned and on time. After submitting my initial inquiry online, I was contacted by Sean and I gave him a brief description of what I was looking for. He reviewed the plan I had been working on and in short order, called me back and outlined his proposal. He was very clear about what services he recommended, the cost, and how the process would work. After I signed the agreement, his team went to work right away.

It was a real honor to work with Franco, who took on the job of writing my Plan. He was able to assess my needs quickly, understand my vision, and help me put that vision into a professional Business Plan. Every deadline was met and the quality of his work was exceptional.

All aspects of the Plan turned out better than expected, but one feature that I found especially valuable is their access to market research and data that was not available to me. When drafting my plan, I really struggled with finding all of the industry data that I needed. Market Research companies charge thousands of dollars to access their information. Not to worry! Don’t spend hours (like I did), looking for hard-to-find information. Go Business Plans has access to that information! And they were able to apply it to writing my Plan at a cost far, far less than it would have cost me to subscribe to a research service.

If you are trying to decide whether to hire a pro to help you with your plan, I encourage you to do it. And I highly recommend you give Go Business Plans a chance to look at your project. You won’t be disappointed! It is a small investment considering the potential benefit it will be to the success of your business or project.

Many thanks to the entire team at Go Business Plans!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>For this, my 6th business plan effort, I decided to go with gobusinessplans.com, and it was the best decision I could have made. Sam Park and his team exceeded all expectations.  Go Business Plans is an extremely capable, talented, experienced, and caring company- and they certainly deliver the goods.  Sam was my primary contact and demonstrated exceptional skill (and patience!) while providing very clear and responsive communication throughout the entire process. Industry professionals are continually commenting on the excellent quality of my business plan and pitch deck. Thank you Go Business Plans- full marks and my highest recommendation!< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< pictures>

I had the pleasure of working with Michelle and Franco on my business plan. It has been one of the best experiences I've ever had with any company. They do fantastic work, they have a fantastic and friendly attitude, and will make sure you are happy with everything. They are an example of how all companies should be. Definitely would recommend to anyone.</Review>

These guys came through for me on a big project. They created a business plan, pitch and financial forecast that is spot on and visually beautiful. Its everything I needed and more to approach my investors for my project. In the future if I need any business plan help, I will only work exclusively through Go Business Plans. Franco was the one over seeing my project and he was patient and very helpful. Answered all my questions and made changes and suggestions to make sure everything came out perfect. Thank you guys for everything. I am sure this plan will help me get funding.</review>

Franco and his team are truly amazing and have been a pleasure to work with. Franco asked all the right questions and was truly able to understand my business inside and out. His plan provided my company with great value and laid out a detailed strategy for long term success. They provided me with detailed market research witch was used to produce accurate projections for the growth of my company. I would highly recommend using go business plans and look forward to working with them again ! Thank you again Franco and team !< /review>

I learned a lot about myself in the process that exposed areas of strength and improvement. This will help me to market myself more effectively when applying for grants and additional funding from investors. They are so understanding and captured all my considerations and true passion right over the phone. They are great and the best decision I made!

The experience that we had with Deirdre was exceptional. Recently, we needed some help in coming up with a well documented and professional business plan. Her attention to detail while we had our first initiation call, during the process and after the first draft submission had been fantastic. Research was done in timely manner and she used resources available to formulate a well planned out business plan. Would recommend this company to anyone. Amazing experience!< /review>

<review>Our company has had the pleasure of working with Franco for the last year. Our social media platform is in the process of raising $7M in capital. The business plan and projections Franco and his team provided have been an immense help to our efforts. Franco has always been readily available and willing to help. We have referred clients over to Go Business Plans and will continue to do so. We would highly recommend the company to anyone!

<Rate>5</Rate><text>This is by far the best group of business plan experts I have ever worked with. After being so overwhelmed and discouraged by other business plan writers/companies who claimed to be the best and tried to rob me to write a church business plan, I prayed deeply about it and the Lord blessed me to find Go Business Plans. They listened to the vision, and worked WITH me. After a very short period of time, I had a dream come true on paper!! The Bible says “write the vision, and make it plain, that he who reads it may run with it(Habakkuk 2:2-3),” and this is exactly what they helped me to do!! Before the plan was even done, the DRAFT was so good that I had reviewed it with a potential partner, and after presenting it to her, she thought it was an amazing plan to help people in need and decided to immediately set up a meeting for the following week to work with me!! I cannot say enough about Go Business Plans and I am forever grateful. If I ever need to update/advance the plan as the church advances, I will ALWAYS and ONLY go back to them and If you are looking for an EXCEPTIONAL, HIGH QUALITY, COST AFFORDABLE business plan, that will speak to every area of your vision, that will allow you to be comfortable and confident presenting in front of ANYONE to get the help and support you need, this is the company you want to go with!! It’s one of the best investments I’ve ever made, thus far.  God bless you Go Business Plans!!- Minister Catherine Jones<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

After doing my research on a few similar companies, I went with Go Business Plans and I could not be happier. They were as fast as promised with getting the business plan ready and the final result was spectacular. They have a great team and are very easy to work with! Would definitely work with them again and recommend to others!< /Review>

The team at Go Business Plans has been nothing short of outstanding.  They were willing to work closely with us to develop a professional, thorough, customized plan that fully met our goals and expectations. Furthermore, they have continued to be responsive and answer questions for us well beyond the finally delivery of the product.  We consider our decision to work with Go Business Plans to be one of the best decisions we have made as a startup. I highly recommend anyone seeking 3rd party support for constructing their business plan to consider these guys as a top contender.< /text>

<Review>Angelique and her team produced an incredible business plan for my startup company.  I had high expectations for the end product and what I received was way beyond what I hoped for. I provided a plethora of information for Angelique to sort through and she did it perfectly, it's as if she was reading my mind! She expertly conveyed our company concept and goal. The research that she had access to totally solidified and supported our position in our industry. I could go on about her professionalism and ever-readiness to help, but you'll just have to hire her  to have a true understanding. I highly recommend Angelique and Go Business Plans!</Review></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I reached out to Go Business Plans back in 2016 at first and spoke with Phil Chau. He was very nice and very informative but I wasn’t quite ready to pull the trigger yet. All I did know at that time was that when I was actually ready, I would be reaching back out to them because my experience was great although brief. Fast forward to last year, I was finally ready to move forward with starting my own business so I reached back out and Phil called me again!! He actually remembered me which made me feel great! I thought that was pretty cool. So we moved forward with getting my business plan in tact and this is when he handed off the project to one of his consultants, Deirdre Hainey. What a great matchup that was! Not only are our names similar lol but our personalities meshed well. The business plan she created was wonderful! I couldn’t have been any happier. That is until I decided to move forward with the company creating my website! I absolutely love my website and that’s due to her listening to what I was trying to achieve. I’ve gotten many compliments on it as well. Not only that, but whenever I asked her to make minor edits or changes to the website after it was already completed, she would oblige with no questions asked and was always responsive!

I want to thank everyone who worked on my project at Go Business Plans and if there is ever a service I need in the future that you all provide, I will be taking my business to you.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2c64adb9f26d1:0x171a8a48c00108f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I interviewed three firms to write my business plan. I needed funding for my start up and some help with market research. Sean sold me right away with his straight forward approach and intellect. Sean and his team agreed to attempt to meet my short deadline of a one week turnaround time. They were able to put together a 31 page rough draft of the business plan then make changes in time for my meeting. I was able to secure over $100,000 in funding.< /text>

As a startup with very low budget, we were looking for a firm with competitive pricing as well as high reviews. After conducting multiple interviews, we opted to work with Go Business Plans. Phil and Kyle were amazing to work with. Not only did Kyle and his team take the time to understand the nature of our business and the constant changes in rules and regulations governing our business, they also provided guidance and support that helped us make better decisions. The end result, was an amazing business plan and a financial model that exceeded our expectations. We’re very happy with our decision to work with them, and will enjoy working with them again in the future as we grow. We definitely recommend Go Business Plans!< /Text>

Go Business Plans is a highly professional company who was able to expertly help us write  our complex biotech business plan.  This company is comprised of very many very educated and intelligent people who knew all the complexities we were facing and delivered to us exactly what we needed.  (The competition did not even understand our needs).  I  highly recommend Go Business Plans for your most complex business plan writing needs!

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>This company is amazing!!!!! If I could give them more than a five star rating, I would. If you are looking for a company to help make your business proposal as professional as possible, make sure you go with GoBusinessPlans. They do a fantastic job of communicating and are a very reasonable company to work with. In my first phone call, I was blown away by how clear and in-depth they were about what would transpire in the time we would be working together. I had talked with four other companies and none of them seemed to show attentiveness or an interest in their work quite like GoBusinessPlans did. I now have a finished business proposal and everything I was promised was delivered on time and exactly how I wanted it to be.

Franco alone was the reason why I gave this company a 5-star rating. This guy is on the ball, helping to create the best business proposal well above my expectations. He is extremely professional and is always very easy to get in touch with. Franco shows an interest and is very enthusiastic about what he does, always trying to make sure that I was satisfied with the work he helped create. I could not be more pleased with how everything came out. You would be making a huge mistake if you didn’t work with this company.

A special thanks to Franco and the GoBusinessPlans team!< /review></record>

It is my pleasure to recommend Phil Sinh Chau and the Go Business Plan team for anyone's business plan needs. Phil has now successfully completed two business plans for me, in entirely different fields. Phil researches each field diligently, and has a special skill of taking this information along with the team's data and drafting an excellent document incorporating the major points required for a top notch business plan. Great work.</text>

i had to prepare bp for eb5 (immigration)
sam , seaun , and kristin were part of my project and let me be honest
i loved the way they finish the project at short notice and spent maximum time checking details of my restaurant to prepare a successful bp
they are very good at financial projections also
they all are very experience and knows what they are doing and very good in co-ordinations
wish the company very good luck and very nice to work with you<//text>

< Review>
This new UNO dental office makes patients pay up front and promises insurance will reimburse customers directly even when they know it’s not true.  I was a patient of Dr. Rodriguez and Dr. Larson, and when the practice changed to Dr. Kandar I was never informed the patient cost would change.  Completely misleading practice and would not recommend.  (The only procedure I had since the transition did not go well either.)<//Review>

<Review>Everyone in this practice is attentive, willing to answer all questions, and able to help even those who have unpleasant memories of dentists past (for example: my roommate is HIGHLY phobic and they take every step they can to help her). They're very thorough and use a number of methods to plan out what you need to keep your teeth healthy. The products recommended to me for home care were available on Amazon and affordable. There weren't any pushy up-sales or scare tactics, just straightforward information about what's going on in your mouth.

It's a refreshing attitude anywhere in the medical field, especially one most people consider a "vanity" rather than a necessity. But you only get one mouth, and the longer you wait, the more it will cost you in the end. Especially since 2020 more or less turned everyone into a jaw clenching and/or teeth-grinding sleeper.

The best thing you can do for your teeth is to call and set up that appointment you've been putting off. Even if you break out in a cold sweat at the thought, you can be certain they'll take great care of you.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I had been going to Dr. Rodriguez for a couple years before he sold his practice to Dr. Kandar. Coming into my appointment I was under the impression that I’d be seeing my previous Dr. Rodriguez. However after my cleaning at the hygienist quickly let me know that I would not be seeing Dr. Rodriguez & that Dr. Kandar was now owner of the practice. This just felt a bit unprofessional to me. Once Dr. Kandar came over to take a look at my teeth I was told I had 4 cavities that needed immediate attention, this would cost me 1200 before my deductible which you are expected to pay upfront at your next visit. I had an uneasy feeling so I went to another dentist recommended by my friend for a second opinion who was shocked when I said I was told I had 4 cavities. It turned out I had NONE. All to say, I would have been out 1200 dollars until I got my deductible back and with the current times & being unemployed that would have made my struggle even harder. I feel as though this practice is unethical and not okay by any means. I trusted this place & feel as though they could have cared less. I hope this helps anyone who might be able to relate.</review>< pics>

Our office prides itself on being fully transparent about our financial policy and relationship with dental insurance. Before we see any patient in the office they are required to read and sign our financial policy, which very explicitly lays out how our payment and billing system works. This includes clearly stating (it is in bold on the form so that it can’t be easily overlooked) that payment is due at the time services are rendered, and that we will process insurance claims so that payment is sent directly to the patient.\n\nWe have a billing team that sends out and follows up on every claim until it is closed as a courtesy to our patients. It is true that sometimes mistakes are made in this process, both on our end and by the insurance company. When this happens, misprocessed claims are promptly sent back to be reprocessed correctly. Sometimes this process takes a while because many insurance carriers will only reprocess claims sent via mail and because everything moves more slowly these days due to the pandemic.\n\nAs for us running a “scam” with dental insurance, I am saddened that any patient would have such a cynical take when an issue has arisen with their dental insurance, and also confused about how exactly this “scam” would work. Do we double collect and then…skip town? Or stick around and hope nobody realizes that we have been paid twice? That does not sound like a very sustainable scam to me.\n\nBest regards,\nRobyn Webster\nOffice Manager\nUno Dental'}</Resp><user>102848167424831448427<//user>< Rate>

<Review>This dentist tried to scam me. They told me to pay up front right after my appointment even though I had checked beforehand that my insurance would cover it. They then said they'd have the insurance claim be sent to me within 2-4 weeks, but after 5 weeks I received nothing. Did they hope I'd forget about it?

So I called the dentist back and they kept saying to wait, over and over again. After about 5 different calls to this dentist, they somehow realized that they had "accidentally" sent the insurance claim TO THEMSELVES. Talk about scamming.
I still haven't gotten my money back and it's been about 2 months since I paid them.

Suffice to say that I won't be returning to this dentist and advise everyone who wants an honest dentist to look somewhere else.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love going to this dental office. Even though I have serious periodontal issues,  my cleanings are effective and amazingly gentle. They communicate well with my periodontist so that I have less to worry about and track. I highly recommend checking them out. Their covid protocols and are also very well considered and implemented.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Dr. Rodriguez and his staff provide excellent dentistry and professionalism.
I'm  always made to feel comfortable and Dr. Rodriguez listens and answers any questions/concerns you may have. He is caring and has great follow up skills.   The dental hygienists do a great job of maintaining good oral health in a gentle, timely fashion and you can listen to your favorite music (headset) while going through your procedure, if you'd like.  I highly recommend (and have) Dr. Rodriguez.<//review>

Excellent experience with Christopher and his entire practice. He is friendly, knowledgeable, explains thoroughly and spent a good amount of time with me. His team is fantastic as well, I was always comfortable while having x-rays and scans taken, as well as through my cleaning. Office is clean and comfortable, all are super friendly and quick to help. Highly recommend!<//Text>

My experience with Chris, Stella, and the whole staff was terrific. From the get-go, the communication and willingness to help was superb. When I finally arrived, I was impressed with the professionalism and comfort they provided. Finally when it came time to the actual work, I was very impressed with their ability to address my questions in a positive and professional way. I had not been to the dentist in 18 months and as a result had 4 cavities. Dr. Rodriguez and his team did a great job answering my concerns but I was even more impressed with how pleasant the actual procedure was! Hopefully I don't have cavities again, but if I do, I know I'm in great hands. Finally, their follow-up and genuine caring attitude solidified my belief that they run a great practice.</Text>

Absolutely the best dental exam I’ve ever had! Dr. Rodriguez and his team are thorough, have excellent bedside manner and take the time to listen to your whole dental history and any other facets of your life that could impact your teeth! Still cannot believe what a fantastic first time visit I had. I don’t even mind that I have to go back for a filling!< /Text>

The experience was top notch! I've never had such a comprehensive exam coupled with a high touch experience throughout; such as a detailed walk through and explanation from Dr. Rodriguez and creature comforts available (e.g., neck pillow, blanket, headphones, and sunglasses). The team has been thoughtful about the entire experience and is intentional about making sure you feel comfortable, relaxed, and well informed.</Text>

Dr. Rodriguez and his staff are incredibly accommodating, kind and professional.  I had somewhat of an emergency dental situation, and Dr. Rodriguez was able to get me in on an expedited basis, assess the problem and provide a temporary quick fix and propose a long term solution.  The offices were clean and the staff made ever effort to be sure
I was comfortable.  I highly recommend this dentist practice.< /Text>

Everyone was on point and very professional. Chris was very comprehensive when describing the process and what/why things needed attention. Over all I am very grateful that the stars aligned.

Excellent service and care.  In addition to Dr Rodriguez, the staff and Dental Hygienist's are top notch.  For the record, I'm not super fond of going to the dentist myself but this office makes as good as it can be in my opinion.< /text>

Awesome attention to detail. They outline all of the options and work with you to come up with a plan that is best for you. So glad I found them and they will be my dentist for as long as I live in the Bay Area.</review>

I am really impressed with this office. I've been a patient since the fall so I have been twice for cleanings and also had my initial new patient consult with Dr. Rodriguez. He was so thorough during my consult and I can tell he truly cares about his patients. The whole team is very friendly, professional and they all do a wonderful job explaining the procedures, going out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Carol is my hygienist and she's amazing! She always offers me a neck pillow, headphones and will even dab on chapstick when my lips get dry during my cleaning! I like that they have text and email reminders too.<//Text>

Excellent, easy to work with, and caring staff. Dr. Rodruiguez is wonderful! Cares about what's best for you and will give you options, and his honest opinion about what he feels is best. Would highly recommend any day!< /Review>

< Review>
I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Chris Rodriguez. I've experienced his supreme knowledge of general dentistry and endodontic therapy first hand. I've been witness to his gentle and able care, his excellent chair side manner and his superior patient follow up. I cracked a tooth, received a perfect crown but when my tooth began to die he gave me an emergency root canal and I'm officially pain free now! All within three weeks!  He took the time to explain my options, configured me in the schedule and performed the endodontic procedure himself so I didn't have to switch dentists. I'm 100% comfortable and confident in his skills, care, staff and pricing. Thank you, Dr. Rodriguez!</Review>

< Review>
I have been attending this dental location for 30+ years and have had the practice switch hands a number of times after my original, highly skilled dentist sold his practice 15+ years ago. I was skeptical when the practice changed hands once again within two years.

I must report that I am delighted. What is very exciting to me, is that Dr. Kandar is a young dentist, though has plenty of experience, so he is up on the latest technology. Also, in this time of Covid, the office was over and above sanitary and I felt completely safe with how my dental treatment was handled.

The diagnostics were superior and I could actually see why I needed the treatment. When the treatment was executed, it was done without an ounce of pain, even the next day my teeth were not sore which really surprised me.

I also appreciate their membership which is very helpful since dental procedures are expensive and insurance is still in the dark ages. What I also loved, was the focus being on prevention, which is where it is at in my opinion. This leads me to Anna, the dental hygienist, who completely enlightened me on better ways to take care of my gums and my teeth and I thought I knew it all!

Everyone in the office is professional, kind, supportive, and knowledgeable in their area of expertise. I am especially impressed with Dr. Kandar, he takes a lot of pride in his work. I felt like he was an artist, careful and accurate. And I must say that I am very, very happy with the two new crowns that I received. They look like real teeth!

Though skeptical at first, I was delighted with my treatment. If you are looking for a dentist or are becoming discouraged with your current dentist, I highly recommend you give this dental office and their staff a try. I am sure you will be delighted you did.< /Review>

<Review>The exceptional dentist attracts exceptional staff. All personnel are highly motivated to assist your needs. Dr. Rodriguez is  very professional and he has positive personality.

Below is my new comment from 09/19/20. My old comment above is three years old. It had five stars. The new comment has one star only.

I had been going to Dr. Chris Rodriguez, and Dr. Greg Larson previous owner,  for over ten years before he sold his practice to Dr. Mohammad Kandar . Few days ago, I had my hygienist appointment. The first thing I noticed that all old  employees were gone except one hygienist.  After my appointment, I was seen by Dr. Kandar. He is a knowledgeable, neat and eloquent guy. I was told hat I would need a new filling. However, I saw Dr. Rodriguez few weeks ago when he assured me that I was just fine. It does not mean anything but I read a previous comment where a patient expressed the same concern.

On my way out, I was seen by a new treatment coordinator whose name was Andy. He looks, speaks, jokes and acts like he is a parolee form one of the SRO hotels from the Tenderloin. I was informed that Dr. Kandar stop processing PPO and switched for 100% fee for service MOU and I need to pay full price for my appointment. I was told that I would need to deal with my PPO insurance on my own and they would mail me a reimbursement check in 24 days!?

I was told to pay $410 for my visit. I refused and asked to see their fee schedule. It was none. Mr. Andy informed that he would clarify my fee with the doctor and would call me back later. It took several phone calls with used car dealership tactic trying to persuade me to pay inflated price. It was $410 after few phone calls it became $ 325 and finally we stopped at $ 155 for my cleaning. Again, I paid the full price and now I have to somehow receive a reimbursement check from my PPO in 24 days.  It took couple of hours and few phone calls to finalize my fee. I asked Mr. Andy to email me their fee schedule, my bill and credit card recite. I have received none.

Dr. Kandar is foreign dental graduate from Syria where he learned how to operate dental practice. This MOU does not work here.< /Review>< Rating>

I first met Dr. Christopher Rodriguez at Mission Dental in ~2015, when he had a brief stent there. I was immediately impressed with his complete confidence and knowledge. I felt his approach and care for his patients was outstanding and earnest.  When I found out he was no longer at Mission Dental and I was in need of an evaluation, I Immediately sought him out. I found out where he was practicing on Google! Thank goodness he was still accepting new patients.
Having been a Mission Dental patient for over 10 years and after being assigned to over 6 different dentists, this decision was easy. My last dental visit this year was when I had a filling filled by a Mission Dental dentist. When it never fully healed I called the Mission Dental/Bernal Smile and informed the dentist that I was in pain. He told me he could not help me because they didn’t have an Endodontist staffed at Mission Dental now Bernal Smile. I was told that I would have to seek an outside person, so instead of using their referral I looked for Dr. Rodriguez. His office was able to fit me in the same week and give me the reassurance I needed and the comprehensive care required.
Never looking back, Rebecca</Text>

I have had several problems with this UPS facility. My packages have not been delivered purposely for an unknown reason. The driver on a number of occasions has come directly into my apartment complex, park his vehicle and not deliver my packages to my door. The last incident happened in May 19th 2021. This lazy, irresponsible delivery driver did not want to deliver my packages I guess, so he decided that he would take my packages to an access point without me knowing. He lied and put into his scanner that I wasn’t home, I was watching him the entire time. He picks and chooses who’s packages he will deliver and who’s he won’t deliver. I made a number of calls to customer service and finally some woman called and left a voicemail message while I was on the line with another customer service rep, her easy way out of dealing with the situation. LAZY! I was at home recovering from a major surgery and was unable to go to an access point to retrieve my packages and I told them this and they did not care. UPS really need to change their habits and the things that they are allowing to take place. People in my situation are not able to go pick up a package and drivers should not have the ability to decide where someone’s property get dropped off at. You don’t know what the circumstances are for people. I contacted the seller to inform them of what is happening to their customers and that maybe they should reconsider using this delivery company for their customers. UPS you suck!!!!!!</review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>It's too bad UPS uses the lowest common denominator (ups ground) to pull profit from a terrible service. Shipping from my town to West Sacramento = 3 days. Shipping FROM West Sacramento to Kansas = 5 days. This means West Sacramento UPS are taking nearly an extra +50% the transit time of their UPS counterparts. UPS corporate knows this and have adjusted their map to take this INADIQUICY into account.  I purchased a 1200$ American Stratocaster and, of course, the seller used the crappiest shipping service available in the US. The 1200$ guitar sat at UPS for the first 72 hours (GOD I hope it wasn't in the TRUCK/SUN that whole time). If more than half of your transit time is spent sitting on the floor at UPS not moving; Maybe it's time to make "customers" and "packages" a priority again. If, instead of going for the lowest common denominator, UPS would actually strive to provide EXCELLENT service; Then maybe people would actually CHOOSE UPS ground as opposed to being forced to use it because individuals aren't a big companies and don't get big company discounts/rates. How quick COULD UPS ground be if they didn't automatically treat all ground packages like South American immigrants at a  Donald Trump rally?<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1617733998795, 'text': 'We apologize your experience at this location did not meet your expectations.

Horrible service multiple times. Staff says the package is ready for pickup and the. When I get there it’s not. So I waste money trying to get all the across town to get a package. That for some reason they can’t deliver it to my place. They always have a problem. And won’t even let me pickup a package to a closer location. Like there website states they offer. And if it does u have to pay for it. I shouldn’t have to pay if there the ones that can’t deliver my package any ways. They should be convenient but there totally not. So just remember when u order a package and they ship ups. Beware you might have to spend extra gas money to pick up package at there warehouse. That’s not even why the horrible. That’s just part of it. They have horrible customer service.</Text>

Many many many times they say a package will be delivered and then I receive a notification on the delivery day of some issue like wrong address, etc. Its happened again today, I waited all day for my delivery, and they said I have the wrong address on the package, but I don't. This always happens when delivery runs long on a Friday so they can delay the package until a Monday. When I lived in southern California, I never had issues with UPS. Back in Sac, it SUCKS, at least the West Sac locations.< /text>

<Review>This place keeps marking my packages as "customer requested pick up" when literally no one comes to my house and I've never requested anything. When you eventually get through to customer support it's some generic customer service company in India that introduces themselves as one thing but when you ask for there name at the end they give you some other name like "mike". All their solution is is to "pick it up". If this was a one time occurrence then it would be whatever, but this literally keeps happening and no one will help me with this. If I had an option to never use ups I would gladly take it even if it meant I had to pay more.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Gmap_id>

I drove to the center to attempt to pick it up! The line was down the street, very little social distancing, and some people did not wear masks! Waited 35 minutes and the line had not moved except for upset people leaving without getting their packages! Due to the heat, I left too! Will try again in the morning!

My package was delayed for one day. No big deal right? I called customer service and the helpful lady suggested I request to hold the package at the facility since it was at the facility at the time and never made it in a truck. This was 10am on a Monday. Fast forward till Thursday afternoon and the package is still not ready to pick up, still being processed. Not way to contact any one at the facility. Customer service line had told me that it was ready to pick up and to pick it up within five days otherwise it will be sent back. When I showed up they said still processing.<//review>

I am currently waiting for 2 packages. One is 12 days late, the other is 8 days late. Both packages have been sitting at this location marked as "out for delivery" each day, but never go anywhere! Today I was able to track one of them on a map. It's sitting on a truck parked at the warehouse!< /Review>

1 star is far to generous of a rating.

UPS has failed to deliver every single package shipped through them. All the packages made it to West Sac then I never heard from them again.

This is no one to contact as UPS has removed their customer service. I have filed claims, but nothing has happened.

DO NOT USE UPS! They have one job, to deliver packages and they are too incompetent to do so. This is NOT a COVID-19 issue. Prime Deliver, FedEx, USPS ALL DELIVER JUST FINE. UPS is the ONLY shipping company that is “struggling”<//text>

This place has amazing staff that really care. That's rare today. They are also practicing very strict rules regarding the pandemic and I felt safe coming here. Great job UPS thanks for continuing to get us packages during tough times</review>

<Text>My express overnight shipping took 5 days to deliver. This place is a hot mess. Every time I have a package going through the West Sac location I just know it will be delayed several days. I live less than 5 miles away from this place and yet they still manage to delay my packages 5-7 days on express overnight shipping. I hope they close this place down. If I ever buy anything online and realize it will have to go through this place I’m honestly just gonna start cancelling my orders.

P.S., a 1 star rating is too high for this plate, I wish 0 stars was an option.< /Text>< Time>

<text>THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST COMPANY ON THE PLANET HANDS DOWN! TOO CHEAP TO HIRE THE NEEDED HELP TO GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC SO THE CUSTOMER CAN GET HIS OR HER PACKAGE. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS FOR DECADES ON EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA SITE ABOUT THE INCOMPETENCE OF THIS COMPANY AND DON'T EVEN OPEN THE TOPIC OF THE FOLKS ANSWERING THE PHONES. WOW!! I'M UTTERLY SHOCKED THEY MANAGED TO GET OUT OF BED ON THEIR OWN  WITHOUT DIRECTIONS AND ASSISTANCE.

I wish I could give 0 stars for this place. My package was supposed to be delivered last Friday. It's now Monday and they said they lost my package. I saw the UPS driver drive down my street on Friday!! But never stopped to drop my package off. This is the second time UPS has lost my package. I'm furious</text>

Had 3 deliveries from the same place, same day that had to be shipped in separate boxes. They gave me all 3 tracking numbers. I was able to track all of them. I had the items sent to a ups pick up location because I’ve been having issues with my deliveries taking forever saying they’re on the truck but them being delayed for a week because of “issues”. Now I go to pick up and only 2 are there and both were open. I had to go through the boxes to make sure nothing was missing. NOW, my other box is missing, supposedly out for delivery, but the UPS store gets there deliveries before noon and they don’t have it. Contact UPS and they say in their system it shows there’s an issue. I don’t know who’s in charge over in The west Sacramento center, but this is horrible. I have filed a complaint and will not use their services at my stores anymore.<//text>

I keep calling the office and they just keep making up excuses for the delay. I tried picking it up myself on a Friday and besides the workers being rude, they did not get my package because it was under a bunch of other packages so they did not want to dig it out. They said to come back on Monday and check again. This place is a horrible delivery place, I only used it because the place where I ordered something only use ups.

Now the next day it is not showing a delivery date but just that it is being scanned for delivery at the West Sacramento facility.. Ridiculous. I will never send it UPS again.... Also no one to talk to!!!!!! i could care less if Amazon has dropped FedX and now UPS is slammed.

<review>Horrible. My package has been "out for delivery" for over a week. Finally have them hold it here, at the West Sac UPS hub, for me to pick up. Was told its ready and now of they cant find it. This place is so unorganized and not helpful at all. While I was here, 2 other customers came in with the exact same problem. Everyone left empty handed. Their reason for the packages being delivered even though it says it was..."they're swamped".

**Update** it's been over a month since I should have received this package and I still dont have it.</review>< Pictures>

They falsified it and now nobody can tell me if my package is going to be delivered by today? After speaking to 5 different representatives !! But their incompetent driver or system still hasn’t updated in my UPS choice so their truck hasn’t showed movement all day.

I think that the system they use tracking should be reworked. because you really never know when the drivers are going to show up. this isn't the driver's fault of course but just an issue with their system.<//Review>

My experience was extremely horrible both times. First complaint is the long wait in line on both visits.  On the first visit we waited in line for 45 mins only to be told that they are so behind,  they just leave trailers full of packages and it takes days to get them sorted.  The gentleman said they were running a week to a week and a half behind.  When I  told them my package was perishable, they only replied with a blank stare and apparently nothing in their system flagged it as being perishable and needing to be refrigerated.  I told them I had ordered some special items for my daughter's birthday, still no concern from them.   They said they couldn't get to the package as it was sitting in a trailer outside the building. Since the item was supposed to be 2-3 days Express shipping, I asked them what are they going to do if it takes a week and a half to get to? Do they have it in a refrigerated trailer?  Still a blank stare.  I was not given any advice of what I should do.  7 days later at 10pm the package was dropped off on my porch.  When we opened the foam box the putrid smell of rotting meat erupted causing us to gag.  The internal temperature of the box was 75 degrees. The cold packs were completely melted and meat was spoiled and filled the box with blood.  Despite my warnings the box was still delivered.   I cannot understand that.  How much common sense is needed to know that someone is not going to want rotting meat.  I returned to the UPS center the next day with the package.  This time a 1hr wait.  I told them I wanted to make a formal complaint but was told I couldn't do it there,  and there wasn't any manager or supervisor available to talk to.  The lady I talked to could care less.  I made them keep the box as they should have kept and disposed of it in the first place.  The wait is long because everyday your package is sitting in an inaccessible trailer,  you get an email/update saying that your package has been scanned and is in transit.  Misleading us customers.  When it not delivered for days we go and stand in line only to learn individually that our packages are sitting in trailers waiting to be sorted.  UPS hasn't figured out that if they had a sign explaining or speaking to the line of folks all at once to explain there packages won't be sorted for a week, 75% of the line would leave and go online to put there packages on hold to be picked up once sorted.  This would save most folks from waiting hours and only leaving with the same explanation and a green print out that says their package is there but in a trailer and cannot be sorted yet.  While waiting in line we also witnessed a truck being loaded.  We saw a box of wine being thrown in the back of a truck, as well as computer monitors being knocked over and tumbling to the ground.   Looked like random people walking into the sorting area, they weren't wearing uniforms or had any type of identification they worked for UPS.  One of them was somebody that was waiting previously in line.  A white pickup truck pulled into the building and started loading packages. It did not stop at the security booth nor was stopped by anyone.  Again, person was not wearing any type of uniform. The 1 star rating is beyond being generous.< /review>

Have been waiting for a package for 2 weeks. I could see the delivery truck delivering around my area but never showed up to my house. I kept getting different emails for time deliveries. I tried picking up the package myself, but I can't even do that. They are even rude when it comes down to the customers saving them time and labor. This has been a terrible service experience<//text>

Local pickup says opens at 10 Monday through Wednesday but that's not true they open when they feel like it. Employees were wearing sweatpants and smoking marijuana in the parking lot. I literally thought it was a group of homeless people until I seen them head inside through security with employee badges I'll never use UPS again. Professionalism is non existent there and it's very sad the security guard was extremely rude when I asked why they weren't open it was 10:15 and the sign says 10 he said they have to wait for the drivers to leave and I told him that's not my problem the sign says 10 am but he gave me attitude and wouldn't let in to sit down and I'm a disabled veteran and I stand there for 48 minutes<//Text>

Stay away from this place if you can. They can't do basic tasks, line is 1 hour any time of the day, so called managers (instead of helping) can be seen walking around with faces of "permanent" confusion. Front line workers have no say, can't do anything proactive that would require even very basic logic. That was my experience here and I'm sure this review is just one of many similar ones.< /Text>

<Text>Today is 6/18/20.  My package arrived at the West Sac distribution center on 6/12/20. I received emails from UPS advising it would be delivered on 6/16 before 9 pm. It wasn't.  Another email that night said it would arrive on 6/17 in the morning.  An update said before 9 pm that night.  No package.  On 6/18 I received an email advising it was in transit, no delivery date and time available.  Then their site said it would be delivered by 4:45 pm.  When it didn't come, I queried the tracking number and it said, In Transit, but delivery Date and time was unavailable.  UPS has a voice recording advising they are not staffing their Customer Service/Support due to COVID19.  UPS has made numerous trips into my cul-de-sac over the last four days but no stops at my house. It is frustrating that my package has been in town for six days, scheduled for delivery on three different days and now it seems to be missing.

Update:  6/24/20  Still nothing from UPS.  No updates to the tracking # or delivery status!!<//Text><Rate>1</Rate><Name>Marion Davis<//Name>< pics>

<text>My package was delayed for two days. On the second day it was delayed I called customer service and told them I’d rather pick it up. The rep on the phone told me it would be ready for pickup within 2 hours. I came 3 hours later and said it wasn’t ready for pickup🙄🤦🏻‍♂️.  The clerk said if I could wait a lil longer he would go look for it himself. Waited another 45 min aaaannnd nothing! This was on a Friday and the clerk told me to come back Monday. So here I am waiting for my package for 2 1/2 weeks. I swear they better have it by the end of Monday😊

FYI YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NICE BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY ALL TELL YOU THE SAME SCRIPT.🤯🤬< /text>< Rate>

One of the worst delivering serve ever. I know it is one week for Christmas I wait 11 hrs to get my package. I think next time they should public that you have to wait 11 hrs for a bloody package. Never again, I know for a fact Amazon is better than UPS any time of the day.. I will make it clear I do not have a problem the the drivers at all.<//Review>

I wait around all day until evening when I get a message saying it's been delayed. Now I have to wait all weekend as well as go through the hassle of getting a refund for a service i didn't get.

I went and a man got my tracking number;said i wasnt in the list, went to "locate" my package and I never saw him again.i waited 40 minutes to leave empty handed and basically was told to try calling someone tomorrow.< /review><user_id>114987627597606278637<//user_id>< gmapID>

Do not trust their tracking service. Went from out for delivery to in transit then processing... they will manipulate the tracking in order to make it seem like they’re on time, but you will not get your package on time.<//Review>

If you are in town this location is quick and easy to get to with regards to United Parcel Service customer service needs. It is never busy and literally I am in and out in less than a few minutes. Very convenient and centrally located in town. Would recommend if you are using UPS to ship and receive.< /Review>

I have absolutely NEVER had a good experience when a package has to go to the West Sac location before delivering to me. Pick any excuse you want, and they've used it. Delayed, rescheduled, saying nobody was home when they never knocked, packages lost or sending it back before I even know they "tried" to deliver. When I check the tracking info on a pkg I DREAD the drama of it coming from this place.<//text>

A place to go when you simply have given in to being too dang busy to be home when UPS tries to deliver your wine shipment. A place that isnt close to anywhere with people working at it that are biding their time until a better job comes along. A warehouse with some kind of cage you walk through to get in just to wait in a line while employees search for stuff that couldnt be delivered. Really depressing!<//review>

<review>This ups is more like a gambling, its a chance that you might get your package.I got my iPhone 11 Pro delivered to another house. My other package was in their transit for two weeks and when I went there the guy working in the front said that It will takes two more days to be ready for pick up. And now I’m there and he is saying that my item is lost. And let me tell you that when I got there there was a huge lane where people complaining for their lost item. Lost or stolen. @ups this is a shame I’m paying for my delivery won’t you want to hire more trusted and more professional employees.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>The employees seem nice, which makes you wonder why they would want to work here.

They claim they cannot scan a QR code from Amazon to print a UPS return label. Therefore, they make you use one of their 10-year-old public computers to log on with your private information to print it yourself to then hand to them. They also force you to pay for that “service”.  Come on.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Only giving one star because there is no 0 star. Package has been "Out for Delivery" for 5 days now and nothing. Many other people are experiencing the same thing right now so I'm guessing that facility is a hell hole right now. I'm curious when they'll actually deliver though...</Text>

<text>I ordered from Target and opted to have the package delivered to my place since it wasn't available for in-store pickup. I get an email from UPS saying driver was unable to deliver my package because there was no apartment number listed. I checked my order confirmation and my apartment number IS listed. I contact Target and they confirm as well that the apartment number IS listed. I contact UPS and they gave me the option to pick it up at their warehouse to avoid the package being returned, but I would have to wait until 9pm to pick it up. I'm 8 months pregnant with swollen ankles so I have my husband go inside to get the package. A couple minutes later he comes out to say that they need me to come in. I go in and the first thing the guy says is that I didn't need to come in and they would have brought the package out to me. By this point my husband is upset because all we want is our package and to go home and they didn't tell him they would bring the package to me. After we receive the package my husband asks for a supervisor, but they don't have one. He asks if they can write down the number to file a complaint and that he wants their names and they rattle off a phone number and refuse to give their name. This whole experience has been a big headache and on top of that as the lady was scanning my package it gave the comment "No apt number listed" and she says "I'm glad it wasn't our fault"...but it was their fault they didn't print out the label to include my apt number.  Very unprofessional and I wish I never have to do business with UPS especially since I've had issues in the past with them.< /text>< Pics>

<review>The worst of the worst Shipping service I’ve ever had before. They always emphasize the importance of the package security without concerning the convenience of shipment. I bought an AirPod Pro on Apple, and it was shipped by UPS. The product was supposed to be delivered by today, but the driver brought the package back to the pickup center without even calling me for the permission to leave the package on the front door! From now on, I will never use UPS again!! Never!<//review>< pics>

UPS has to be the slowest shipping service available. Not only have I been waiting over a week for my package, I cant even get ahold of anyone to ask what's going on. The only tracking service says my package is in a facility that is 10 minutes away from me and has been there for over a week. I have not been given any information on why.</text>

<Text>I go here often to pickup a package or drop off one that's an amazon return more often than some other kind. The entrance is a little place compared to the monstrosity that is this building. But I've only had good experiences. Friendly and fast service unless it's really busy.

I appreciate the location since it's away from traffic. Always easy to get here!</Text>< Pics>

UPS corporate says my package is ready. Go to the place where it is physically at, they say they can’t find it and to come back later when they look for it. UPS at this location is the absolute worst. Refrain from coming here if you can!!!!!< /Text>

Horrible customer service.  Online tracking said package was available for pickup.  I drove to West Sac to find out that package was delayed and won't be available until the next day (Saturday).  The agent at the counter and a supervisor said that that can happen some times.  I asked them when it would be available and they said tomorrow.  I asked the agent if they were open tomorrow and they said yes, and confirmed they open at 10:00am.  They both assured me that I can pick up the package despite the sign and online information that says they are closed.  I drove to the facility again to find that they are indeed closed.  I called customer service and they sent a message to the facility to have someone call me.  They called and confirmed that they were closed and that the package can't be picked up until Monday.  In the future I will go out of my way to use another carrier.</review>

The tracking sucks. I had to put a package on hold for pick up. They said I could pick it up in West Sac between 9-10pm. I was told this by 3 different people. 815 pm someone calls and says it was not there yet even though the tracking said it was. UGH..200 camera rental for the weekend wasted!<//Review>

They Made Me Drive From North Sac/Roseville To The West Sacramento Service Center To Pick Up A Package That They Said Had Been Mislabeled By The Shipper And Could Not Be Delivered, The Manager, A Stout Woman With Salt And Pepper Hair, Swore That The Address Numbers Were Wrong On The Shipping Label And That Was Why It Had Not Been Delivered To My Home, Yet When The Package Was Given To Me, You Could Plainly See That The Address Was Spot On! And Not The Wrong Address. The Manager Knew This, So did The Guy Who Carried It Out, But They Never Said Anything About It, Which Means They Did Not Wish To Call Attention To Their Earlier Erroneous Statements That The Street Numbers Had Been Wrong. My Correct Address Was Clearly Marked In Two Places On The Top Of The Package, The Shipping Label, And The Packing Slip, ALONG WITH MY PHONE NUMBER! I Had $1200 Worth Of Motorcycle Parts In That Package, Believe Me! I KNEW THE ADDRESS WAS CORRECT BEFORE I SAW THE PACKAGE! No Big Deal, I'm Contacting My Lawyer Next Week Anyway, So I'm Just Adding UPS To The Subject Matter To Be Discussed While There.<//review>

<review>I made a delivery for an arrangement of flowers to be sent to my mothers work for Valentine's Day. (I actually ordered online and sent through the floral company, which I did not know would be an issue later)  I made a mistake and didn't specify suite number but I did apply for phone notifications and not once received a notice of delay and a need for more information. I corrected the information over phone in the evening and was told package would be delivered the next day (15th). I'm constantly refreshing the tracking page and it goes from "in transit" to "delay" again without it giving me a text notification. I call customer service and they said the correct address wasn't received in time so delivery will be for the next day. Flowers 2 days later!! Yes first was my fault second is totally on them. I asked if I can pick up and they said my photo ID and address had to match the delivery address and no other exceptions! Obviously the senders address doesn't match someones work address. Now we await until they can finally communicate properly to deliver the package hopefully with still beautiful looking flowers. If not, thanks for not making this delivery special! I understand it's a busy time for deliveries but come on, at least have alternatives when customers are trying to make the best out of the situation or keep the updates we requested accurate on time and not hour later.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad4063367db73:0x5d06f3224a314aa6< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Riddle me this ¿How can a pkg make it from Missoula MT 1056 miles in 3 days, but not 7.4 miles in 3 days???
8/3 6:57pm destination scan.    New futon arrives in W Sac B-Day present for 8/5.
8/4 5:09 destination scan, 11:29am = WE LEFT THE PACKAGE IN OUR FACILITY. THIS MAY CAUSE          A DELAY. WE WILL DELIVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
8/5 3:28am destination scan, 12:51pm = WE LEFT THE PACKAGE IN OUR FACILITY. THIS MAY CAUSE A DELAY. WE WILL DELIVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
8/5 9:42pm The receiver arranged to pick up the package at a UPS facility.
8/6 11:00am Husband drives the 7.4 miles to W Sac and picks up the day late pkg... takes 17 min...<//Text>

2nd day air due for delivery on Wednesday. Package was not delivered, not delivered Thursday, Friday says attempted delivery. I was home all day and no one came, even security cameras  proves they lie. They get lazy and lie!! Now we have to wait till Monday and pickup at hub in West Sacramento. Worst delivery company ever, continues to go downhill. This has happened multiple times with UPS!! Yet, we still get charged for 2nd day delivery charges that never happen because of lazy employees! I can’t wait to see UPS out of business with all the new delivery companies that have customer service!< /text>

<username>Marco Shen< /username><rate>1<//rate><Review>The worst shipping experience that I've ever had in my life. If I may, No stars for this kind of service.

Long story in a short, here it is.

I ordered a vacuum machine from Amazon prime, which was supposed to be delivered on Sep/08. I had a friend waiting at apartment for whole day, however, I swear, there were no any their so-called "attempts" of delivery, nor any delivery notice being left. I personally contacted the service center and had the package to be held on site, the same-day pick-up. The service agent reassured me that I would receive another phone call to confirm whether or not I could come over to pick it up.

Again, there were no calls at all. I drove to this center on 10:10pm, guess what, It's closed. I just got a face from the security guard like this " You deserve this, and I can't do nothing for you, We left, we closed, CANT YOU READ THE SIGN out there!!"

This package, around 15lbs, a vacuum machine, with a decent size

I do believe this 2 day delivery from UPS charges more on Amazon for this express shipping, however, UPS is totally not responsible at all, not even close to being responsible.

I believe this is the way how UPS manage a heavier weighted package because this is my second time to experience this kind of irresponsible treatment.

I could totally tell that this delivery guy didn't even try to deliver this item, because as I said, my friend and I, we didn't have any forms of notifications of attempts from UPS. ZERO, ZERO, ZERO !!!!!!!

UPS, they don't care if this is a express delivery. They don't care if the customer needs to run back and forth because of their inattentive and rude attitude. They don't care how much they've charged on the third party or shipper to have this express delivery done.

They only care about one thing. They earn the money and they deliver easy items.

Why?

I could receive smaller, lighter item of a running shoes exactly on the "same date" when the heavier package should have been also delivered.

I will also appeal this situation to Amazon, because I think they should seriously reconsider UPS as a good/responsible carrier for this kind of express delivery of heavy item. For the amount of money spent on UPS, I believe Amazon Prime could find a better carrier.

I would never and even choose UPS. No service at all.<//Review><Time>1504937286692</Time>< user_id>

UPS is the worst shipping company ever. Everytime UPS is the chosen delivery company, I do not get my packages and I have to drive all over to different access points to pick up my packages. I get the run around from everyone when I call and complain about their drivers. Their drivers are horrible. I had to go down the street to the truck to get my package because the driver is dumb and doesn’t know how to open a door to walk into the complex to deliver the package. Non of the gated doors were locked, so there is no excuse why he could not deliver my package and submit attempted delivery but no one home. Total BS when I was home all day. This happens every time and has been happening for the past 3 years. FedEx and USPS have no problem delivering to my address. UPS sucks and I can not stand their delivery service.< /review>

Was supposed to obtain my package two days before attempted delivery. I've been home all day studying in the living room before my class. When I check the tracking it says that they attempted to deliver but no one was available. Not a signal notification from the UPS worker that someone was waiting for me to answer the door. Because of this I didn't receive my books for the class I was supposed to attend, ruining my education.
If you plan on doing this crap, you better start paying for my books and tuition.<//review>

<Text>Don’t use UPS if you live in Sacramento. They lost a package of mine and in order to make a claim I had to sign a form.  They told me they would deliver the form and then after a few days I called the ups help desk and they said that the investigation was closed due to me not responding. I’ve been on the phone 4 separate times, each time for over an hour and no one wants to take any responsibility.  If you don’t want to go through a similar situation use USPS or FedEx.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

They said they attempted to deliver my package but I was home. No one had shown up and they didn't leave it. So I called and they said they would deliver it the following day. Then all of the sudden they didn't have my unit number. I called ups again and the nice lady was going to have this service center call me. They called and left a voice mail which told me I get two more attempts to deliver or they would send the package back. They hadn't attempted.. So I called UPS again, and the man was rude and saying nothing he could do to get me my package today. I would have to wait for another attempt. I spoke to his supervisor who set it up for them to deliver today (Thursday) instead of Wednesday as my husband was home all day. Once again they didn't deliver because they said there wasn't an apartment number. I called corporate, spoke to another supervisor who contacted west Sacramento. she said I could pick it up at the hub between 8-9. So I drove 15 miles, in the rain to get it.. To be told that its 9-10. So I sat in my car until 10 minutes till, then went to the security hut. Whom left me outside to wait in the rain while they got ready, which I had to walk through the Hut back outside and into the next building. I feel they should pay me back for the stress and gas I needed because their driver couldn't read the number 8 on a box. You have 1 JOB! I would like to state.. Even the guy I picked it up from.. Saw the apartment number ON THE BOX!!<//review>

Ordered a package, its overnight delivery, so I can watch my driver on the app. I watched him not deliver my package and go right back to the warehouse at 6pm, customer service says they deliver till 9pm. so to the driver that decided to clock off early, youre awful at your job. this ups has no reguard for its customers, there has been no attempt to deliver my package for two days.<//Review>

<Text>First off they didn't even try to accommodate my request at any point! It is very important for me to receive packages for my four year old birthday party. All week, I had been going back and forth between shipper and UPS whom both are disappointing at this point! I'm looking at my packages being held at this facility and there is nothing they can do about because guess what their closed which means no packages to present for my angels birthday party🙁...all free shipping is not worth it as they select to go with cheaper options that delay the packages from being delivered on time!! Corporate will hear of this!< /Text>< Pics>

I have been waiting for my package all day and when 7:30 rolled around I decided to track it to see what the hold up was. It said they attempted to deliver it. Which DID NOT happen. I've been watching this door like a hawk since 11:00am. So of course they are closed all weekend and won't even attempt to deliver until Monday. The delivery guy must have just scanned the packages in his truck and went back to the warehouse because he sure didn't show up here. Can I do anything about it? Do they care? Is anyone going to hold you accountable? Of course not. I guess I'm just going to sit here with my thumb buried where the sun don't shine until I get my equipment. Oh but I'm sure they will show up Monday at 7:30 and claim I wasn't here again. Why does anyone even use you? Next time I'll drive to Kansas City and pick it up myself. Thanks for nothing UPS! I'll go F*** myself now!<//review>

UPS lost the package and was supposed to contact the driver and call me back within an hour. That never happened. I contacted UPS the next day and they said the phone call was never documented. I had to file a missing package report and it could take anywhere from 1-8 business days for someone to get back to me. Since I was charged for the "next day" shipping, i asked UPS if they were going to credit my account. They said i had to call back in 10-15 business days and file another report. I should have just delivered the package myself.</review>< pics>

<text>This is as cheap and efficient as you're going to get from UPS! Listen very closely because I'm about to give Sacramentians some knowledge on how to save some bucks! Ready? COME HERE TO SAVE ON SHIPPING COSTS - DO NOT GO TO YOUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD UPS STORES!!!!! This UPS is the main hub and when you go to your neighborly UPS, their prices are high because it's a franchise and they get a percentage so they mark their prices up! :) The lady that served me was quite efficient and was very calm (love it)! Don't think she needs help to lift your heavy boxes either fellas - this is what women like us strive to be; independent and only asks for help when it is seriously needed! I had to admire this woman plus she was just a doll! :)<//text>< pics>

You would think they could find a customer service representative with better English skills. After several failed attempts to to speak out my tracking number over the phone, because the automated answering service misunderstood me every time, I finally got put through to a person. But when I gave them my tracking number again, all they could tell me was exactly what I was looking at online, 2 day old information. When I asked about the status of my package, they said it was probably still somewhere in a truck. My package arrived in West Sac at 12 noon on Saturday, so why is it still stuck on a loading truck? The rep told me they don't work on Saturdays and so my package wouldn't be unloaded until sometime today, Monday. Which means that I won't be able to pick it up early like I wanted. I could barely understand the rep throughout our entire conversation and I think the person I was talking to was having the same difficulty. It was clear that English was not their first language and as a result it was very difficult to get any explanations or answers. Based off all the other bad reviews and experiences others have had with West Sac UPS, I guess this is just par for the course. I wish corporate UPS would step in and save their reputation in Sacramento, rather than letting it continue to go down the drain.<//text>

The driver here is a thief. He drove by my house and never stoped to drop off the package, then marked it as delivered. UPS is "investing" the issue but it sounds like they are just going to brush it under the rug. WORST COMPANY EVER, they will hire anyone.<//review>

I only gave this store one star because zero wasn't an option. It arrived in the west sac facility on the expected delivery date. I live in Davis, package shipped out from west sac the same day for final delivery, on schedule but it was sent to San Pablo, Ca. 5 days later it's back in west sac, and the delivery date keeps being rescheduled a day later. I tried to call the customer center but nobody answers. I've missed the deadline by when I needed the package by. I would advise people in the Sacramento area to use another shipping company.< /Text>

On top of that, the customer care line told me that it was most likely my fault and that UPS is allowed to kill animals in shipping.

Packaging was checked by the employees at this location and they said it was good. Their incompetence resulted in the death on my pet, and then they blamed it on me.

I can't say the customer service is rude, but the people that you get on the phone are like robots. they are not helpful. It's like they are required to read off a script no matter if it helps your situation or not. no extra information or tips pertaining to your matter; just the basic info that you can get online. multiple times I have gotten misinformation that ends up putting me out or inconveniencing me due to someone telling me something that ends up not being true/not happening. Everyone's so mixed up in the bureaucracy of it all that nobody can actually just be a helpful person. SO much room for improvement. UPS rarely delivers<//Review>

Worst experience ever. I'll stick to the alternatives. They leave my package on the sidewalk, never knock and I've had quite a few packages stolen this way. NEVER GO UPS!

Also, boxes come damaged when they finally make it. Are they growing it around like a football or something? Almost like they dropped it and ran it over. Worst company ever! Stick to USPS or even DHL.</review>

<review>Like the previous post my package was left in the West Sac facility and I also am leaving day after tomorrow early AM and need it. They're tracking info posted. "We left the package in our facility. This may cause a delay. We will deliver as quickly as possible. Delivery will be rescheduled." Called was on hold for over 15 min. Was no help, they can't guarantee delivery tomorrow or when it will arrive. Was told to check status tomorrow.  If not out for dilivery call back, and be on hold for knows how long again. So much for "This may cause a delay" it has caused a delay.</review><user_name>John Luther</user_name>< user_id>

I called just to ask about pick-up location and time in case my friend could pick it up. But the location was too far, so I did not want to consider that option and said it pretty clearly to the UPS assistant. But what's happened was the UPS put the package on the pick-up option. So........

...the package did not arrive for the gift to a friend who was moving away. It's still stuck at the UPS center with no one to pick it up.
And......I cannot even change it to other delivery options since it's already been changed once (from deliver to address  to pick-up). The change that I did not do.</text>

I have to send some positive marks their way.  I don't like UPS, I have not had good encounters with UPS, but I was highly satisfied with my transaction at this location.  My "undeliverable" package was quickly and efficiently located and I was on my way without the usual confision, hassle, and lack of urgency I have come to expect from UPS.< /Text>

<Text>If I could I would give them negative five stars!!! When I checked the website to track the my package. It said they tried to make a delivery. Yesterday and today total B.S. as I have been here both days. And today they said they were here at 10:57am. What a lie I was outside my front door because the mail lady was here. I would know if someone was here do to the fact that I'm the manager here. And we have only 20 units, and when I called I ended up talking with someone in the Philippines.  WTH!!!!!! I'm so sick and tired of calling places only to be calling across the world. I will never us ups ever.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

UPS in a joke. They never deliver on time they just keep your packages in the truck on your delivery day. Then scan it the following day as though it was just received by them. At least I know better and print out the delivery schedule online. Also last year on of the delivery drivers threatened not to give me my package when he tried to bypass my house and I had to chase him down in my car to get my package. I dislike when companies us UPS I prefer FEDEX and day of the week.</Text>

<Review>I would give it a zero star if it was possible. They steal items. Saw on camera ups staff delivering item and signing it himself. Mind you this happened at a hotel. Didn’t even have a staff by that name that worked here. They are thief’s. Whole day ruined because of this. Conference gone to waste with item delivery. Pathetic customer service to. Was on hold for 30mins before someone answered.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

I had no problems.  I was actually worried this was going to be a problem picking packages here since they weren't sent to me and I had to represent my company.  After Waiting in line for a few minutes, the person behind the counter helped me, was nice and took maybe 3 min to get my packages from their massive warehouse. I guess other people just had bad days.< /review>

< Review>
Monday: package was scheduled to be delivered. I stayed home all day and nothing showed up.

Tuesday: package rescheduled to be delivered. I stayed home all day, but nothing again.

Wednesday: fracked the package all day and was no where to be found. I called the customer support number, which has zero power and do absolutely nothing to help, and they said my package was still in Poland. Even though the tracking system said it was I. West sac. When I got home I heard a loud bang at my door. Long story short, the delivery refused to give me my package and left.

Thursday: I have already put in a complaint with the customer support, who are useless, and was told someone from west sac will call me in the morning. No one called. I call the customer support again, who are useless, and they told me someone will call within the hour. No one called. I then drive down to west sac to get my own package because UPS as a company is totally incompetent. When I got there, they told me the package is on the truck still and I'll have to wait till 10pm for the truck driver to get back. I said I'll stay. 10:15pm the truck arrived. A lady went into the back then came out and said that package is not in the truck. She said they have no idea where it was at. The best thing I can do is put it on hold and hope it shows up on Friday. That's what I did.

Friday: got a call from UPS saying they have found my package is ready for pick up from 9-10pm. I drove back to west sac at 9 and, I don't know why I was suprised at their lack of ability to do their job, they told me that the information I got in the afternoon was wrong. My package was not ready for pick up, and they have no idea where it's at. The lady there told me to come back Saturday. I was told by another employee that the center at west sac is closed on Saturday.

Saturday: frustrated and disappointed, I decided to rant about UPS and my experience, although not the first time, of how horrible the west sac branch is at delivering packages.<//Review>

Was not home so package was sent to a "UPS ACCESS POINT" where I had to go pick it up.  This "Access Point" was a liquor store in a bad part of town.  Once inside witnessed an altercation take place with two drunk/drug persons.  Having paid to have the item shipped this is not my idea of good customer service by UPS.  Thank goodness I did not ask my teenage daughter to pick up the package.</Text>

Very bad service and ignorant staff and manager! Not only is talking to them less reason then talking to the wall, they are rude! UPS extremely delayed important package even though it was signed allowing to leave it by door they still didn't leave it, then messed up the label and then I called told them to leave it and they still didn't. The "manager" there is also clueless and ignorant and keeps talking about access point and cannot understand simple thing that the package notice was signed to leave at customer's door. Talking to them is useless. The female working there is also ridiculous, in a rude way she grabs packages and I wish I didn't come close to her because she smelled very bad, no joke! The guys there are very awful. And I thought USPS was bad, this is ridiculously unprofessional and ugly company. I'll try to avoid it as much as possible and recommend all do same.<//text>

<review>Service is so bad i can't even give them one star.I sent a package ,via UPS on 4/4/16 and now it's the 14th and the package hasn't arrived yet, but wait it gets worst. I was tracking the package and notice that they had an issue with the address. I called them to try to help them get the the address right. I was told that they would intercept the package and send it to the right address. that i would receive a call when that happen. my package was delivered to an address 300 miles away. they've been trying to retrieve the package for two days now.

No phone number to access customer care center directly; Poor updates on package;
Package sat in warehouse for a whole day before moving. 4 hour estimate, FedEx and usps serve the community to a higher and more efficient standard when serving local sacramento communities.< /Review>

I ordered two packages on Friday for overnight delivery from Amazon. Amazon got the packages from Kentucky to UPS West Sacramento by 8:06 AM Saturday. UPS opens at 10 but just let the packages sit there all day. They delivered on Monday, but too late for my needs as I was holding a training for which the materials were needed that day. This is the second time in a year that the UPS center in West Sacramento has failed a delivery causing me and the sending companies a lot of grief and significant financial loss. This office is completely unreliable and incompetent!< /review>

I have had plenty of problems with UPS, from very late delivers, tossing my packages and not knocking or ringing the doorbell to notify us of the delivery. I would rate them at a zero stars but thats not an option. We have been waiting a week for a purchase to arrive, and finally today we received our severely damaged item. Now we have to go through the inconvenience of delivering the item to the UPS store and waiting another two weeks.</Review>

It's hard for me to even put into words how frustrating my experiences with UPS have been. The area that this center services, is so poorly managed it's very nearly impossible to receive anything using UPS. I have never had an issue with GSO or FEDEX, even USPS outperforms UPS in this part of town. Very very very frustrating. I cannot stress enough, if you live anyplace near this UPS including downtown ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE UPS, go with another currier!</text>

<text>The Sacramento branch is terrible!! I paid extra for 2 day shipping because I am going out of the county tomorrow for several weeks on vacation. I ordered something specifically for my vacation. Now I find out 2 days in a row they forgot my package at the warehouse. Now my package may show up sometime while I am gone. And their customer service was no help at all. Just kept saying it will be delivered. So far my 2 day shipping has become 5 and counting!  I'm so pissed!!!!<//text>< Pictures>

They left a notice with box checked saying you can sign the back and we will leave your package here tomorrow. I signed the back and left the notice on the door. The next day there was a new notice saying we can't leave it because it has alcohol in it. I get why they have that policy in place but how did they not know it was alcohol the first day but they did the second...Then I drive to the facility and they tell me the item is still with the truck and will attempt a 3rd delivery. Was home most of the day. Didn't hear anyone come to the door. No notice saying we missed you and we'll be back again or pick up your items at our warehouse. Not the first time this has happened and I'm sure not the last.</Text>

( thats my fault i know) but on the slips they left they said they would leave it at a ups for me to pick it up buy didnt leave an address? Then they tried to deliever it again! And i missed it. So i called so i can just pick it up myself. They called me to say the pick up time would be 9-10. I thought they told me at night which i thought was strange but i went and its all closed off and no place for customers to go. So i tried calling and no answer. I look online and it says they are closed. Then i thought maybe 9a but they dont open until 10!? I cant get ahold of anyone and the universal number just tells me its at that location. So annoyed.

I GIVE NEGATIVE------- STARS ! THEY DON'T DESERVE 1%
This place is veryyy terrible ups center, they are full of BS, very RUDE , BAD , CRAPPY customer service, and drivers never show up to your house, they lie that they did but they actually don't even bother to get to your house to deliver. I ordered my package and they keep delaying it, i call the ups customer service all they say is i will email to the ups center so they could give you a call, i get the call i asked why is my packaged delayed 1 week, they keep saying i am not sure why and that we will get your package sent next day, next day COMES & still don't receive MY package again and again day by day, i call every single day they just keep leing and never showing up , while i wait at home for it.  It had been 1 MONTH and i still haven't got it :( they just sent back to the sender! so i placed another order after, and it was the same story over and over. 1-800 ups is no help as well they don't even want to listen to you all they say is i will send them an email.. .and the people that work here are all full of BS, they don't respond, don't want to talk to you , they would call and when i start mentioning where is my package they just hang up!!! THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB, ALL THEY DO IS SIT AND DO NOTHING. THEY NEED TO  GET FIRED, BECAUSE THEY ARE STUPID HERE, LITTLE KIDS IN 1ST GRADE ARE SMARTER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE. I am not the only one that is having this issue, all the other people are in the same page as me. comment and ratings are horrible

after about 2 months of stressing not receiving my packages i finally got it, ridiculous< /review>

UPS is very different in sacramento than the rest of the country. In Michigan, They ROCK! I order stuff from Chicago on ground (The cheapest) and get it next day and no issues for over 20 years. Anything Order that goes into this west sac office has immendendant one week hold put on it. It comes in but never leaves (or leave many weeks later) I have called the corp offices and they say with california's insane employment laws, there is nothing they can do and they are very sorry. If you go down here, watch how fat the people are that work there and how slow they move but when it is quitting time, The indy 500 does not move that fast. If your package goes in to here, best wishes and just pray some day you may see it.</text>

The drivers say they attempt delivery but they don't, many times it has happened that they say they attempted but 1) we were outside or near the door specifically waiting especially after this started happening and 2) there is no slip saying delivery attempted so even if we somehow didn't hear while hanging out 3 feet from the door the entire day they clearly didn't actually try when an attempt is actually made we get a slip<//text>

<Review>I took off work to wait for a mattress delivery and these bozos claimed to have attempted delivery because I was “unavailable.”  I was right by the front door most of the day.  If they had actually tried to deliver, my dog would’ve barked nonstop!   The driver just plain lied!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Had worries after reading reviews so I got there early and was first in line.  Man at entrance and desk clerk were both friendly and the clerk offered the use of the hand cart without asking for a deposit or any other assurance.  (Of course, he had just checked my ID and had my name and address).  Could not have asked for better service.<//text>

<review>Beautiful mosaic steps in Sunset area of San Frsncisco. Both sides of the steps have very beautiful a d delightful garden. You can see the view of San Francisco bay and Marina district clearly on the clear day. Upon coming on top of the steps, you can climb up a zigzag stairs up to the top of the hill where the Grand View Park is located. From the Grand View Park you can see everywhere of San Francisco, down town sky line, the Golden Gate park with De Young Museum poking through, the Twin Peaks near by, the Land End etc. It is a very good experience. Best of all, it is usually not very crowded and there are plenty of roadside parking nearby with need to pay for parking.<//review>< Pictures>

It is a fabulous spot for pictures with the mosaic steps on the stairway.  Walking up and down the steps would be a good exercise for the day.  View from the top let you see the Pacific Ocean.  You will enjoy the great view during sunset.  So get your camera ready.

By the way, bring a jacket since it could be chilly and windy...<//Text>

Beware of thieves working in groups. There was a lady out there carrying a fake baby, zipped in her coat, trying to entice people to find more stairs at the top of the staircase. There is another staircase but I'd advise you to get in the car and drive it up to the next level. Also, lock valuables in your trunk.<//review>

The staircase is beautiful and the view from it is also exceptional from wherever you stand, whether you’re on the stairs, on top of them or at the base. Neighborhood parking is available, although depending on the time of the day, there might be a lot of people on the stairs.<//review>

Really cool mosaic art on the steps.  There is parking on the street all around which was easy to find for us.  You can get some fun photos here.</Text>

I've been here twice. The stairs are pretty. There aren't very many of them, but interesting to see and I wish more stairs were like this elsewhere in cities. There is a spectacular view from the top, almost 360 degrees and see a lot of the city at once. Great for a sunset too. There's another small stair with mosaic nearby too. There's also a bus stop at the bottom, so you can go even if you don't have a car.</text>

Cannot say enough good things but for everyone to go and experience these steps. Feels like you're going up the escalators to ParK Guell in Barcelona, Spain, except there is nothing here at the top except beautiful views.< /review>

<review>The hidden steps start on 16th and Kirkham so don’t miss that part!! There are a LOT more steps than i thought and i think it’s worth it to do all of it. Great view. bring water though. And don’t plan anything to be right after because you might not see it all or you’ll be late for your next thing.< /review>< Rate>

Beautiful mosaic art.  It's worth the visit.  If you go there, don't miss the Grand View Park with nice view just above this location.</review>

<Text>Fine Place For A Sunny A.M Vista View Scape. Lots Of Stairs.  Once you get up the first set Mosaic  stairs continue on your far right will be a mid staircase once up those stairs to your far right we'll be another staircase lead you up to the top To Grandview Park where the view will be A Sweeping 360 Scape View . It it is a wonderful way to get some exercise  . To get there take the N Judah To  19th Avenue walk  to Moraga Avenue or take the 28 19th avenue. Walk East On  Moraga and you will find the steps.😁👍<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzvDa3ItetawNCtRtFgJ8eRRvyyKDviMn2_uYm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

(Translated by Google) The design of the stair mosaics is very nice, perfect for taking pictures. In addition, these stands lead to a park that has a very good view of San Francisco. It is worth visiting if one has time to spare in the city, especially to go see the sunset from this place.

(Original)
El diseño de los mosaicos de la escalera es muy bonito, perfecto para tomar fotos. Además, estas gradas llevan a un parque que tiene muy buena vista de San Francisco. Vale la pena visitarlo si uno tiene tiempo de sobra en la ciudad, especialmente para ir a ver el atardecer desde este lugar.< /text>

<review>This place is the best for all of your smoke shop needs! They have their own juice they can mix up for you. They also carry other pre-bottled brands (I prefer their own in-house stuff) they carry glass, hookah, loose tobacco, etc. And the staff is always patient, chill and knowledgeable.<//review>< pics>

While the prices were reasonable, all the juices we purchased have the same bland taste and the guy working there seemed annoyed we interrupted his episode of family guy to have to help us.< /Review>

<Name>Raphael Denman</Name><Time>1452308116845<//Time><rate>2</rate><Review>I don't live in San Diego, so walking in to this shop I was surprised. It is not a 'traditional' brick and mortar vapor shop. They sell only their own juice, which to be fair isn't bad. So if you're looking for a certain juice you've had before, like I was, you won't find it here. As for the quality of the product, don't expect the testers to taste like the bottle you take home. They mix the juice right there in front of you, which would be fine (cool, in fact) if it weren't for two things. First, there are no measurements taken. If your juice contains flavors such as honey, cream, marshmallow and caramel, each in specific percentages, well, all of those ingredients go into the bottle... In what appears to be a rough eyeball guesstimate. Second, since it's made right in front of you, it hasn't steeped or blended properly (not a huge deal, but it can make a big flavor difference). The staff (the one guy in there during my visit) was nice, knowledgeable and helpful, though, despite the fact that he wasn't even using the juice they make and sell there... The only real positive thing about this shop is that the prices are awesome, like half the price of premium juice at a regular retail shop.

TLDR: Low prices, but you get what you pay for.<//Review>< pictures>

Everyone there is helpful. Really great pricing and great vape juice. You can tell from cheap knock offs and cheap juice to quality. If you are a beginner to this. They will teach you without feeling uneducated. You get to know the people that work there and become almost family. Recommend them to the fullest!</Text>

It's a shame to throw a product you bought a month earlier in the trash. When I tried to contact them explaining the problem with my device, they told me that they could not help me because it had been more than two weeks since the purchase. Hearing such a thing in 2019 is really creepy. Avoid buying from them. ⭐⭐< /text>

<Review>I've been looking everywhere for "Cheshire" by Catapiller which I buy for roughly 12$ for a 15ml I bought the same tasting juice exactly for 18$ a for 50ml, he made it right in front of me and because of the D*ck heads FDA he had to give me cotton to change them myself. Probably the best place to get juice. They have shelves FULL of juice you can mix and match, I'm not going anywhere else<//Review><response>None<//response><Date>1471472091567<//Date><gmapID>0x80d955c04b565371:0x5762c11d4fabbd7b< /gmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_id>112053898474655940651<//user_id>< username>

<Text>The WORSE customer service I ever had. Bought the product before my trip to Europe. When I tried to charge the batteries it didn't work. When I came back from my trip, went to shop and explained the problem, they said because Its more then two weeks( it was 3 weeks after buying) , they cant help me and I have to contact whoever made the product , which was in Chinaaaa.I kept emailing the company it took me a week to get respond and they told me that I have to take pictures of product explain the problem and send product back, when I went post office They said it will cost $ 20-30 to send a package ,the  product cost me around $50 LOL this is crazy .So I decided to contact the shop here again and ask for help. .Mike gave me the phone number to the Manager, I left 3 times message and he never called me back. FANTASTIC DEAL ...DONT EVER BUY PRODUCT FROM THEM .< /Text>< pictures>

A fantastic small town restaurant. If nothing else, go here for the margaritas! We’ve tried many dishes here and some are better than others, but overall, definitely 5 star worthy. The service is always spectacular. They are incredibly fast and polite.< /text>

Really good and refreshingly authentic whether you get street food or one of the dishes. Locally owned family business as far as I know.<//text>

<review>I frequent this unique restaurant every couple of days because I love the  special atmosphere that is part of this place. The personel is exceptionally helpful and professional. The service is certainly fast. Also, the food they serve is perfect. I ate there more than once and I was always happy. The rate is honest. I recommend this place to to all.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>The chunky salsa and chips are good appetizers for a brunch. I had the slightly spicy eggs, rice, and beans covered with melted white cheese. The house coffee does not overpower the taste buds and it softens the food spices. The service was friendly and helpful. Be ready to wait in line during busy hours.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjo4Nc9L8NwnISkYgCber0jWmki5jflMxi0KY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlil6JU9qMm3HDj_AZdSiCU8TT3YwR2WdGiDw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>It's been almost 24 hours since I had their food, and I still have food poisoning symptoms. My girlfriend found an almost complete shrimp shell in her taco salad (shrimp were not ordered). We also specifically asked for the super sweet Jamaica and Tamarindo drinks to be watered down since we're diabetic and pre diabetic, they did not, in fact they had a superficial ammount of ice in each cup; the exact opposite of what was ordered. I do not recommend this place at all.</Review>< pics>

We happened to be in the area visiting friends and were drawn in by the eclectic patio and decor. The waitress was kind but had a large number of tables on her hands. We very much enjoyed the chips and salsa that came in mini jars as they were extremely flavorful and the texture was great! The food was good but the Chile Colorado was bland and had many more onions versus meat. The tortillas were also quite good but the food was only saved by the delicious flavoring of the salsa. I would come again but maybe just for the appetizers.< /review>

The staff is great but the food is awful, the food has no flavor, the asada plate was the worse I have ever eaten, the meet was hard and looked uncooked, the asada tacos had no flavor and had so much oil that it drip down my son's finger, I DO NOT recommend.  Save your money, very disappointed.  NOT authentic mexican food.<//text>

<Review>Wet Burrito 10/10
Green Chile Pork Burrito 10/10

One of my favorite spots when I'm craving mexican food and El Patron satisfies me everytime 100%.<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>Friendly neighborhood cafe with some outdoor seating. Go early or late because it fills up fast at mealtimes. Good-sized menu, and Mexican hard and soft drinks. But, the best part is the service staff, which is always the life's blood of a great restaurant.<//review>< resp>

< review>
FOOD was no bueno. rice veryy bland. Beans tasteless.... Even the mushroom quesadilla was a wet, slimy mess.  Salsa was not enjoyable.... i ADORE Mexican food, i live nearby and was stoked to try,   cant see myself craving this restaurant's food. No rich flavors, ingredients made for each other almost didnt get along, some thing was off. Chimichanga tasted like STRAIGHT up oil, enchilada was worse than if a white girl tried to make it.  Kinda fooled by the high rating, shouldve skimmed reviews..< /review>

I would love to love El Patron.  It's a cute place with lots of character and acceptable Mexican food, considering how far north we are.  I would go there more often if the service was better.  From my experience yesterday, I will never go back.  When my group walked in, the waitress practically sneered at me and didn't smile the whole time we were there. The waiter was not much better.  We waited forever to be served with no apologies and a sour face when one did show up to take our order.  There were only two servers, but it's a small place, so being understaffed is not the real issue.  When I see a staff so unhappy, I have to wonder how they're being treated by the management.  Bottom line:  I blame the management.  They deserved no tip, but I felt sorry for them and left my usual 20%.  Bad service leaves a bad taste.  Come to think of it, the food wasn't that good either.</review>

This is a great local spot you could miss it if you didn't know it was there. It's a small intimate setting. The food was delicious, it was definitely fresh. The margarita was so good. I definitely recommend this place for quality Mexican food. The staff were helpful and attentive, overall great service.</text>

My husband and my friends and I go to El Patron once a week for dinner. It's a local diner and we love it! Their salsa served with chips has the best flavors of any salsa from a Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Their carnitas fried pork is well rendered and not fatty and tastes wonderful. It goes on.  We could go to more expensive places in the area, but we always come back to El Patron.<//Text>

S1E8 "Justified". This place was labeled as "Zippy's", a fried chicken place. Stop in and get some good Mexican cuisine and be a part of tv nostalgia.<//review>

Food was quite good, but service was lacking. Didn't get any water or soda refills without asking, repeatedly. No utensils were on the table when food came (had to ask again) and orders were mixed up within our party of 4. But, as I said first - the food was great!<//Text>

Friendly staff and quick service. I probably would have rated higher, but maybe I picked the wrong thing to order. The tortilla soup tasted more like chili. Would be a return customer, however to try something new if I were a local because the service was great.</Text>

I've lived in the neighborhood for about a year, but never got around to eating here until today.  Called in an order for a burrito, told me 5 minutes, I was there in 3, and it was ready.  Very big burrito for the price, and it was good but a little plain  (I'll get to that) , but what really put it over the top for me was the unexpected bag of warm chips, and a half dozen little containers of various salsas and dips, all tasty, especially the Mexican sour cream.  Seems they keep the burrito plain, but supply you all kinds of ways to spice it up the way you want...which I liked.   I'll definitely be eating here again.< /Review>< username>

This place used to be so good. Somehow the food has lost its seasonings and flavors. I constantly have to request less beans to even taste any meat..... but they still put wayyyy too many beans on their nachos, tostadas and burritos. You will feel like a vegetarian. Damn. Used to be so good.<//Review>

Great family owned place in Altadena.  The food is good,  and tastes home cooked. There is usually a line out the door of hungry locals.   If you're in the Dena, it's a good spot for sit down or takeout.</Text>

This place does not disappoint. The homemade salsa is delicious, the margaritas are cheap, and the fajitas and tamales are delicious (and not expensive). Seriously, I've been doing it all wrong up until now when it came to getting Mexican, this is my new favorite. The next time I'm in Altadena, I'll be coming back.<//Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>This is another overrated restaurant that serves average food with below average service.  Came here for breakfast and was happy to see a line... that usually means it's good.  Unfortunately, the food was just ok, nothing special.  Service, however was below average.  When you have to ask more than 3 times to refresh your coffee, it's NOT a diner.  Totally overrated.<//Review>< Pics>

The good:

Small community feel. People know people here, and say hello and chit-chat.  The staffing at the restaurant is like a family. Treat them like your cousins, aunts and uncles, and they will, of course treat you well.  Just like anywhere, the more you get to know them, the better they treat you.
The food is good, and reasonably priced.

The "bad":
You will only find bad here if you are hyper critical. No, this is not a posh place. Go somewhere else for that. They don't do fusion menu items, it is not that kind of place.  They do get busy, because people like to connect here, so it is possible you may have to wait for 20 min mid week at dinner time.  Longer if you come on the weekend at peak dining hours.

Worth going, if you are near by.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>To start, our table was cleaned off by a dirty rag. The smell permeated for a good 5 minutes. I should have looked at that as an omen. The shredded beef in my enchilada was inedible. It was so tough and chewy I couldn't even chew it and swallow. I literally had to spit it out into my napkin. I was so excited to try this place, because there are not very many eateries in Altadena, but I will not return. The service was sub-par. We were not even asked how our food was. The server chose to chat with her friends at a table, she was actually sitting down with them and ignoring everyone else. Such a shame.</Review>< Response>

There was a long wait, which isn't out of the ordinary, but what was infuriating was being passed up on the waitlist twice. The second time, the server who had asked to confirm our name after seeing us waiting outside for more than half an hour, just looked up at us and then called the table for other folks whom they clearly knew. Extremely unprofessional.

After going in once again to ask about table, I received a very unsure "oh you're next".

Needless to say, our appetite was ruined, and we left.</review><Time>1549687587049</Time>< Rating>

The owners are wonderful, personal and friendly, and make it feel like home when you walk in. We eat there usually about once a week. Well okay, we get take out - it's yummy, quick, and easy after a busy day. Happily El Patron is incredibly popular now so we bypass the wait and feast at home. !Viva El Patron!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

One of my favorite restaurants in altadena. Very friendly atmosphere with excellent options on the menu. The only issue is parking as the restaurant does not have a parking lot.</Review>

<Review>El Patron is a crowd pleaser and a go to for Mexican food when we have guests from out of town.

Delicious fajitas and mole. I love the orange sauce on everything.

Top rated gelato across the street for desert .

Decent service once you get seated. It's a small place.

Local Guide Tip:
Come early to avoid waiting.
Or order take out to feed a crowd.<//Review>< pictures>

Basic family Mexican restaurant with a BOMB Margarita. Try the tamales! The salsa isn't my favorite but that's a personal preference. Cozy, local, and great for families.< /Review>

I just found and went to this little Mexican restaurant in the Altadena neighborhood of LA, and found on the corner of Altadena and Lake Avenue. I liked it. And was completely surprised at the "wine margaritas" ,as they were called, which are imbued with agave, very smooth, but potent.
Atmosphere, food, and price were all more than expected.</text>

<review>BEWARE OF ARIANA!!!! She has NO manner, NO ethics and rude!!!! We waited for 1 hour, and then a group of 4 came. They were declined because the kitchen was almost closing. I was sitting outside, my husband was sitting inside. One of the ladies came out and said,"I'll talk to the manager. We can get in ahead of these people (that's us!)". I went in & told my husband,"They're gonna cut the line!!!" Lo, and behold, ARIANA let them sit first! I was so angry, the she rudely and impolitely argued with me that the group had called and made an RSVP. There is NO effing RSVP for this restaurant!!! I was furious and we left. The owner came running and apologized. We came back BECAUSE the kids were already hungry and it was already 8:35pm. My husband was still furious and didn't want to go back but I said, let's just let this pass because the kids were very hungry, it's for their sake. I hate ARIANA. The rest of the crew were very apologetic.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The food is ok and they give nice portions. Helpful staff. The downside is that seating is very limited. I wouldn't wait 30 mins to eat here. Gave it 3 stars because my enchiladas were cold, the cheese inside was not melted.< /Review>

<Text>This is a very cozy corner spot the decorations are very colorful and the walls are adorned with all kinds of memorabilia. I ordered a shrimp cocktail and it wasn't served already mixed so, at the top half I saw what I believe to be the clear shrimp water and at the bottom half all the tomato sauce and other ingredient, this did not look appetizing. Usually when I've order shrimp cocktails in the past they were served cool, but this was served very warm. The cocktail wasn't bad by any means but was bland I had to use a lot of salt and lemon, also this is the first time I've ever been giving lemons instead of limes. The waitress never came back to check on is after initially taking our order. My girlfriend ordered shredded beef crunchy tacos plate the meat was cooked well but unfortunately also was bland she also had to add salt to her tacos. The rice good but felt a bit stale like it wasn't recently cooked. Would try again and order something different just to give them another chance.< /Text></record>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Delightful Mexican restaurant in Altadena. Friendly and attentive staff gives you the feeling you're in a lovely Mexican village.  Traditional Mexican food such as tacos, enchaladas, taquiitos and burritos with a heaping mound of guacamole and sour cream. We were all ooing and ahing during the meal it was so yummy.  I didn't have any cocktails as I was on some meds but will be going back for margaritas as they looked delish.<//review>< rate>

Surprisingly good Mexican food with good mixed drinks.  It's located in a small and funky Mid-century Modern building so it tends to get crowded.</text>

<Text>This is where I go when I want true Mexican food. Despite living in Southern California melting pot, it is difficult to find good, authentic, affordable Mexican food. At last, El Patron to the rescue.

Most of the food  here is good.

Tortas? Excellent!
Carne Asada? Will tantalize your tastebuds!
Drinks! Very good

Ironically, I don't really like the tortilla chips. I've ordered them a few times to go, and they always taste like they were made with old oil.

Spacing is also limited, so you might have to wait a little bit. On Friday and Saturday nights, there is always a line outside the door.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c2c313893ef1:0x43cb2279b8ca85f3</GmapID></record>

<rating>2</rating><Text>I arrive in the afternoon around 430pm, I was the 5th table in the restaurant which meant it was not busy yet.  Did not get greeted as I came in and sat down.  I ordered an appetizer and a carne asada plate.  Quickly enjoyed the arrival of my appetizer.  However about 25-30 later after seeing the restaurant fill up to max seating and 3 tables after me receive their orders before me I became bothered.  I asked the waitress several times about my order and failed to give me an answer.  Finally 40mins into this experience I received my  order.  To my long wait and surprise the meat was over cooked, tough and had the consistency of rubber and jerky.  I had mad e several requests to the waitress and asked for other items and she failed to bring them.  As the afternoon went on more people waited outside to be seated.  I spoke to the manager about my meal and he gave me % off my check.  I informed him of his waitress and the lack of service she provided.   Overall I would not recommend this place poor quality food, poor service, good location.  Its convenient if you live in Altadena, but I will not be returning to this restaurant, even if it is convenient.  Much better restaurants down in Pasadena.  Don't waste your money here!  For those who do frequent this restaurant shame on your poor tase.<//Text>< Pictures>
