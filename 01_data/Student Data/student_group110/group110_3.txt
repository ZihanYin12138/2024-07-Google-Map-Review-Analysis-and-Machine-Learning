The best UPS store ever. The staff is super friendly and nice. Very short waiting time compare to other locations, also long hours services which are super awesome. I needed a Notary service, and I called more than 7 locations, and they all told me that they are only open until 3 PM or 4:30 PM. But only this store was servicing until 7 PM. Very excellent customer service!!</Text>

<Text>Amazing customer service! I went there to ship items to India and the owner was super helpful and guided me through all the various options and the most cost effective methods. They even packed the box for me! Its my first time experiencing a store actually caring about the customer and saving us money. Will definitely go there again.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>New management goes above and beyond for you! I've been coming to this UPS store for years. As a teacher, I visit the store on weekly basis to create projects and worksheets for my students. The new management is a little more tech savvy I guess and has cut my weekly visits down to minutes instead of an hour!

All I have to do now is email my images and worksheets, then pick them up when they are ready! Tania (the new owner) even rotated and resized my images and suggested a thicker, but cost effective paper that will last much longer in my students little hands. Thank you UPS for giving me my time back to focus on my students!<//text></record>

<Review>This particular UPS should be the standard for which all others attempt to be. Since the current owner Tania took over it is basically the perfect place to go. I had to ship two plants in mason jars and not only did she help out with extra packaging and essentially making it a project for herself, they both made it when I fully expected one to get hurt. This place is great!</Review><name>Hayden Richter< /name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1622914794970, 'text': 'Thank you Hayden for the outstanding review.

<Review>This is a great UPS store. I love going to this place. I started going to this particular store in the beginning of 2020. I watched how they maneuvered and adapted to the new protocol as the coronavirus stuff started unfolding. They handled themselves very professionally. The staff is very capable and pretty upbeat. It really feels good to enter this store. I wish I could give them an extra star for their outstanding customer service.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I just stopped by to drop off items for Amazon return. The internet is out in all of Santa Clara, so she's unable to access the Amazon system. but instead of saying sorry and just sending me away, she took my returns took a picture of my QR code my email address and phone number and will send me the receipts as soon as her internet is back up. The customer service goes above and beyond what I ever expected.< /Review>

I had to return something for which I had the pre paid label saved on my pen drive. All I needed was to stick the pen drive to the printer, take a print of the label and send the shipping. The ups or fedex charges.80 cents for the print out but strangely this store didn’t let me take the print directly from the printer instead asked to use a computer and charged $3 for computer usage fee!! Seriously I didn’t have to use a computer all I needed was a print from my pen drive. I’ve been to 10 ups stores before and all of them have the same rules except this store. The lady at the store says UPS stores are franchises and every store has different rules?! What is the UPS corporate for when it’s franchises makes it own rules?!< /Text>

The prices here are much higher than other ups store. 1321 s. Winchester, right down the street charges 50% less for color copies. When I didn’t want to pay the price because I was shocked it would be $220, and asked to buy less copies, they said I couldn’t since they were already printed. Unfortunately, my work budget wouldn’t let me pay for that price. I understand the prints were already done but the last ups store I went to was half the price. When explaining this to the women who worked there, she said she would just bill my company weather I took the copies or not. I left and went to 1321 s. Winchester and paid 50% less there. If they try to bill my company I hope I don’t get in trouble. It was really disappointing they wouldn’t work with me on this. I won’t be returning to that location. One, because of the prices and two, the negative interaction I had with staff. I hope this helps someone else not make the same mistake I did and just go to another location.</review>

{'time': 1532382179254, 'text': 'This customer threatened us with an ultimatum of taking less copies or none at all so we offered to give half off her total cost which would\'ve been $100 something (originally $200 something). She still wouldn\'t accept that price so I don\'t think it\'s fair to say that we weren\'t trying to accommodate her at all... after all she paid the "half off" price at another location so why didn\'t she accept our offer? Was it just to spite us? Any responsible adult knows that if you have a budget for something you should research and confirm prices before going with it. If you don\'t and are shocked by the cost then we can try and work with you (which we did) but don\'t just walk out leaving the small business to suffer. Every person needs to be responsible for their own actions and this customer should have just taken responsibility and paid it and know a lesson was learned for next time.'}< /Resp>

Within a few days my flyer was ready, she was always very welcoming and friendly for edits I recommended. She had a designer who did a timely job. I really loved the way flyer came out to be. I am so glad to do business with this store. If you are looking to expand your business and need delivery on time this is the store for you. Definetly check it out! Love the professionalism here.

*THE WINDOW SIGNS ARE BLUE*

Got my passport photo here. They showed me the photo before they printed it. The people working were nice and friendly

THE WINDOW SIGNS are blue. I added that because I ended up walking past it expecting the gold and brown that is with the ups logo. Just a heads up.< /Review>

They were good to me when I was a customer.
Not very friendly once you end the service. I had to pay exorbitant fees ($10 per pickup) for any mail or packages coming to the box once I terminated the service.  The USPS does not allow forwarding from these boxes.
I don’t understand why this UPS place could not be nicer to their ex-customers!
I used a UPS box in Lafayette with much better and friendlier experience.
Not all these places are the same.  My advice is to go with a different location in the San Jose area.<//review>

<Text>This UPS store is the best one in the area. Like many others have said, the employees here know what they are doing and are more than willing to offer help. Unlike the other stores that tell you to leave packages at the counter, this one will make sure they receive it and will personally print out a receipt for you. I would recommend anyone who lives in this area to come to this one.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I've been here 3 times and I've left pissed 2 times. it's always something .we need a dollar to put tape on your Amazon return. we need to charge you for the air you're breathing in the store.  I hate their customer service!  Even though it's convenient to my job I will go out of my way not to use them.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Very bad experience.
Last Saturday,  I needed to sent a package and the only reason I went here is because they were open.  I told them that I had pershible item yet they let me sent unless I paid my head off.  What has made me angry is on their official record, they noted that the package was given to them on Oct  30 which was Monday  yet I left my package on Saturday  October  28.  According  to their tracking number, the package was in CA until Wednesday  November  01 the day it left the state.  It arrived at its destination on November  02.  What is even more  furious is it was put on truck to be delivered on November  03 at 9:15 a m  and was not delivered until 8:55 p m.  This is totally unacceptable.  How could that be possible?  Why wasn't  I informed  that the package was not leaving on weekend.  The sad part if on Monday October  30, I sent another package by the post office at 8:30 a  m and it arrived at the same destination I previously mailed the ups package and it arrived November  01 at 2:20 p m. Worse, I paid way less for a 2 day package by the US Postal service than what ups charged me for a package that took 6 days to be delivered.
I've  never had such total luck of respect.  I will never again use the services of this location.   I have and will continue to tell everyone  I know of such bad service and will share my experience  as proof of my disappointment.
So, be ware of the service that sees nothing but dollar signs.  No one refuse to pay if one is well served.  To do such a lousy job is just unacceptable. When you go here, please ask questions, they will not help you if you don't  have information.  Hopefully  this working will help someone else.
A very dissatisfied customer.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Very bad experience.

I arrived during my lunch break from work to have a document notarized. First I had to wait a long period of time for the owner to come out to notarize the document.  Second, she began a conversation with another customer while she was notarizing my document.  When I asked her to stop working on my document until she finished her conversation, because this was after all, a legal document, she very rudely responded to me with "I can multi-task!"  Did she not realize that I was the customer and that I have to feel comfortable with the service?

Very rude.  I will never patronize this establishment again.<//review>< Time>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>This ups store is so lousy and they don’t care about your packages. I mailed two of my usps package to this store because they said I could. Then they go on to say if it gets lost is not our responsibility because it’s not ups. You partner with Usps it is your Responsibility to make sure the customers package gets shipped. I lost 280.00 of shipping goods because of them! Both of my packages are lost. Don’t  trust the people working here! They don’t smile, they have attitudes, and get an attitude when you ask for help. I am not happy at all.< /review>< pics>

Fun shop jammed full of amusing gifts, toys for all ages, cards, party supplies, art supplies, stationery. Much rotating holiday stock including Jewish holidays.  examples: for children: board games, craft kits, a small selection of books, novelty birthday cake candles shaped like animals or that light up, top quality plush hand puppets, modeling clay, crayons paint, beads, feathers, glue, wiggle eyes, mad libs, baby pull toys, need toys, etc. Etc.
For adults: board and card games, stuff like Band-Aids, soap, and magnets with silly sayings on (for a while they had a lot of bacon things), beautifully designed and unusual kitchen tools, locally themed-but-artistic-and-useful items (think cutting board in the shape of the state of California with San Francisco marked). Moleskine and other notebooks and journals, high quality art brushes and paints, coloring and sketching pencils and paper, some pre-stretched canvases, fine fountain pens.
At Chanukah, an astounding variety of menorahs. Christmas, ornaments. Passover, Seder plates. Easter, Halloween, you name it.  Often seasonal earrings, socks, etc.
Birthday and blank cards for a range of ages and tastes. Also congrats, new baby, etc.
It's not a big store so the selección Of each is carefully curated.
They have a couple of dogs that may wander around as if you're not there. They'll give your dog a biscuit if it's ok with you.<//Text>

Eclectic collection of fun cards, gifts, toys, kitchen ware, and endless gadgets. We poked our heads in for a look and ended up walking out an hour later with a year's worth of cards and gifts.<//text>

I always come here to get my copics, sketchbooks, and baking supplies, I love this place because it feels homey and the dogs make it feel better and warm, some of the prices are a bit high but I love the place too much to complain<//Text>

Love, Love, LOVE this place! I am never disappointed with the options for art, hobbies, gifts, and creative sections for journaling, creating, etc. You will be greeted at the door, you will be asked for assistance, and you will appreciate the help in finding unique tools. I needed a blender capable of smoothing colored pencils - and they had one. I've been to an artists' store and they couldn't find a better option.

I've bought gifts for a variety of family and friends - and back in 2005 purchased the cutest umbrella that is STILL WORKING and in great shape. You'll find gifts for kids as well as adults, including games.  I always look forward to another visit!< /Text>

<Review>This store is super amazing! You can find a gift for everyone you know at Just For Fun. They even have professional art supplies. My one complaint is that it is very hard to decide what to buy because there are so many awesome things! If you love fun stuff including art supplies, toys, and crafts, then you are in luck!<//Review>< user>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I randomly found this hidden gem of a store while wandering around Noe Valley, and I already can't wait to go back! I went in looking for Christmas ornaments: they had a large selection of traditional ornaments as well as funny, unique ornaments. I walked away with a glittery hamburger, a shiny piece of pizza, and a cute dinosaur to hang on my tree! In addition, they also have great Hanukkah decorations and a selection of Menorahs in a wide range of prices.

I didn't see too much of the store besides the holiday stuff, but I could tell they had a variety of gifts and stationary. The store is also home to some wonderfully fluffy and friendly dogs :)< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They have a great art supply collection, the best selections of fine art brushes, but unfortunately their prices are so high that I would rather travel across town to spend my money. If they could match prices with Blick or even high priced Flax I would buy their art supplies all the time.< /Text>

<review>Walked in no greeting, the man working that day looked at me in a bad way, ignored it but then scared me he had a high pitch tone "Can I help you, with anything?". I said, "No, just looking." And then another customer who was on the other side of things he asked them the same question in a nicer manner.  I would like to visit the store again, but I think I have to bring a white friend and dress my Sunday's best.< /review>< Date>

Jam packed with all sorts of stationary wonders, expect to see various dogs and little ones making themselves at home amidst the books, journals, party supplies and seasonal items. The associates are always friendly and welcoming, and they keep treats for four-legged friends behind the counter.</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The shop invites you to browse and find things that you can't find anywhere else. All very friendly and helpful.

I would not recommend using Crestmont Capital. They use high pressure tactics and they are reluctant to put their interest rates in writing. They do not understand what is like running a small business.<//Review>

I am thoroughly disgusted with this company. I was misled in their lending practice and will never use nor recommend this Crestmont Capital to anyone. Dealing with their senior financial consultant, Christopher Chavez, was a huge mistake. He may have a nice title but is only interested in the sale. My credit has been damaged because of his lack of knowledge</review>

Excellent experience dealing with this company and their service. My account manager is extremely reliable. He has given complete explanations about the way my loan works. The interest rate was exact to his word, I’ve received the funding we agreed upon and this was a big help for me during my time of need. 5 stars here.<//Text>

Crestmont Capital is a must for anyone looking for some quick funding for your business. I've dealt with them on numerous occasions and the staff from top to bottom have always been courteous, professional, and very friendly. Very prompt and I received my funds as promised. I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for a loan.</Review>

Travis is a super hard working and dedicated consultant. He helped me obtain any and all information I needed to make an educated decision on what would be best for my company without the pressure of trying to push me in one direction or another which I admire. I would recommend him in the future to anyone I come across.</text>

I only have good things to say about my experience with Crestmont Capital. The representatives are friendly and knowledgeable. The funding is fast, my approvals are within hours not days. I'd recommend Crestmont without any reservations.< /text>

My representative, Allan handled my account professionally and with the utmost understanding of my business. His knowledge of my industry is what makes Crestmont Capital number #1 in my opinion. Thanks to him, I can rest easy knowing he has my back during trying times.<//Review>

Applied thru Blue Vine / Crestmont for my PPP program and they did a fantastic job!! Had previously applied thru BOA, and Blue Vine got approval in 3 hours whereas BOA took 30 days. You get personalized service from this organization that is unmatchable from the big banks. Alan and Alex did a super job and really care about your business. They are always accessible and professional. FIVE PLUS STARS!!!!  DR. HERNBERG/TOMORROW'S WELLNESS CENTER<//text>

<Review>Michael and Crestmont were awesome. Quick to fund and painless for a small business like ours. At first I was skeptical as they needed to have view only privileges to our online banking. After working with Bank of America we were able to get that set up and everything was 100% above board. I guess I am getting old and not as trusting as I could be with sensitive information. Overall just a great company to work with!</Review></record>

Bill was awesome! This is my first time working with this company but will not be my last. I have worked with other funding companies in the past but none have been able to match the quality of offers presented to me with Crestmont Capital<//Text>

<Text>would highly recommend him to take care of any of your business loan needs. I am more or less a novice toward banking jargon and they needed specific information. The staff was all very helpful and willing to walk me through the process. I am very thankful to the professional demeanor and positive "can do" attitude they show.

Michael was very helpful and helped us meet our needs very quickly and very professional, funding application process was very simple, easy and fast. The funds were in our account almost immediately once the application was approved and their rates were very reasonable compared to other funding companies. Great Job!!!< /review>

I denied there loan bc I found a better one and one of the loan officers kept texting me telling me pretty much that I made a huge mistake for going with a different loan company and non stop messaged me for 20 min. Telling me I need to answer my phone etc I politely asked 4 times to stop messaging and that I was happy with the loan and terms I got from avant. Then he/she text me next time pick up your phone lol very disrespectful and ignorant!<//Review>

Crestmont helped me and was able to finance me rapidly. Their interest rates were competitive and they have no early payment penalty. I needed them a second time during the time I was repaying for the other loan. They consolidated both loans for me. And again this was done rapidly.<//text>

Alex helped me obtain all the information I needed to make an informed, educated decision on what would be best for my company without the pressure of trying to push me to do business with Crestmont Capital, which I admire. I would definitely recommend him in the future to anyone I come across.<//review>

Carter was very helpful, knowledgeable and communicative throughout my entire loan process. I doubt I would have been able to fund without his help and tenacity in dealing with the underwriter. This was a fairly painless transaction due to his involvement.<//Review>

This is my 3rd round of funding through Crestmont! If you need money to operate your business there is no other way to do it. Thanks, Brian for helping me with my 2nd renewal. This couldn't have gone any smoother.< /Review>

I have tried unsuccessfully to unsubscribe the unwanted emails from coming to me, I have emailed Brian Williams, Director of Lending to remove me from his email list but I still am getting emails and I am offended.  I wouldn't do business with this company if it were the last company out there because of their aggressive tactics.  I hope that they will stop this soon or will have to take further action.<//Text>

Don't quite get these glowing reviews. My company received an email that clearly stated we were eligible for an attractive rate for up to $175,000 for a Small Business Line of Credit, but when I called, it was classic bait and switch discussing a rate 1.75% higher than written.<//review>

All of these glowing reviews are completely false/spam.  Received an email regarding business capital, out of curiousity did a quick lookup of the company.  I came here to find a flood of positive reviews....seemed suspicious.  Sure enough...if you click on each of the reviewers listed here, they all have one or two reviews....of the same company(s).  6 or 7 of the reviewers here have also left a 5-star review for a hotel called the Travel Inn in Washington. So all of these people have coincidentally stayed at this hotel in Washington AND worked with Crestmont Capital?  Also many of the reviewers have also left glowing reviews for a company named Sprout Capital (which after a little more research online turns out these companies are connected somehow).  They’re clearly paying for/ordering these reviews.  AVOID these spammers/scammers.<//text>

Unfortunately I tried dealing with Bryce and his communication is lacking. I went a different route for my business funding and no longer need his services. BUT everyday I get bombarded with generic emails , I've tried calling, emailing to ask for the solicitations to stop , but day after day no response. I suggest you Try calling and try every option. No one is home?<//review>

After be they had several fire pits set up outside. They gave us free hot cocoa hot cider and Christmas cookies etc. All FREE. It didn't feel like Christmas until that amazing night. I can't wait to check out Sunday service. I almost forgot...the bathroom was so nice they had different smell great lotions to choose from. They're definitely doing it right. We felt so welcome we will be back. Possible we may even CHANGE Churches.< /review><Name>Michele Powell<//Name>< UserId.>

Visiting from Denver Co we found City View Church.  From the moment we got walked in the doors we were greated with a smile and a hug.. We heard such a positive and encouraging word from pastor Troy on doing it MY WAY🎶 ..
Highly  recommended if your in the San Diego area and looking for some fellowship visit the brothers and sisters at city view..<//Text>

<username>Clinton Goeb< /username><Review>I recently started attending this church, from the moment I walked in I was welcomed with open arms with no reservations on who I was or my past. I needed to feel at home to be able to come back and like a family they showed me the love Christ has for His followers. I see the glory of God with every sermon I hear and every smiling face I encounter.  I havent been pushed or pulled in any way and I dont see any negativity towards other churches or denominations as is shown by other congregations today. Definitely a family centered church that has become my new home. Thank you Jesus for bringing us together and to CityView for everything you have done in my life.</Review><Time>1576053070431<//Time><userid>115792720539784825590</userid>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>City View Church is an extremely friendly place to come get connected with like minded believers.  "Every person counts" is the personal theme of the Pastor's and staff as well as the members.  There are small groups to meet any individual need for community and the corporate times of worship are overflowing with God's presence!!!  Pastor Troy preaches the Word in an unapologetic, dynamic way every week!  Can't think of going anywhere else!< /Review>< Pics>

I am sorry but please do not waste your time. Their spanish church is under new leadership. I went to one of the new pastors class and fell asleep in my chair. The new Spanish Pastor has one vision and that is getting a pay check at the end of the week.< /text>

Go grateful for a Pastoral Team that follows COVID guidelines and makes corporate worship happen! We meet outside in a beautiful setting, fellowshipping while still social distancing. Worshipping Jesus! Sunday mornings 10 AM. Kids' ministry, too. Join us!<//Review>

Jesus asked, "Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to Me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. Msg"  I have found such peace, hope and strength at City View Church. You matter to God. Come as  you are to experience the love of God, where every person counts.< /Review>

It is so unprofessional and ungodly like for them to down talk the church I strongly believe in. I have made my decision and they need to stop brainwashing people. We should have the power to decide! If they talk bad about other churches imagine what they are teaching their community. JUST HORRIBLE!</Text><Time>1529692403472</Time><Gmap_id>0x80d9556a4b3ca653:0xe4b59f8f56f2442e< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

My home warranty company assigned Premier Appliance Services to fix my microwave, refrigerator, washer, and dryer, after two different companies misdiagnosed and didn’t complete the job. Their technician, Nate, fixed all 4 appliances. He was very professional, quick with his work, and made me aware of what to expect with their process along the way. Parts took about 2 weeks to arrive but once they did, I was able to schedule follow up appointments quickly and got them all fixed right away. Very happy with their service!<//Text>

<text>They were expected to fix dishwasher covered under home warranty but there are completely unorganized and unprofessional. One of the part was delivered a week ago via FedEx and the tracking number confirmed delivery but they had no record of receiving the part. When asked about how long does it take to reflect received parts in their system, the representative hung up the phone instead of answering the question.

We ended up requesting insurance to switch to another service provider as we no longer want them to service any of our appliances. WORST VENDOR, STAY AWAY FROM THEM.<//text>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I was referred to this company through my home warranty originally last summer for repairs on my subzero refrigerator.  It took the technician a total of 7 trips to get it fixed.  One to diagnose and another because of a wrong part after he opened everything up and another 5 trips because whatever he initially replaced did not fix the problem.   Now fast forward to 2021, two weeks ago we had our dryer catch on fire.  We called the warranty to come out and again they sent Premier and the technician came out and inspected and found that it was an electrical fire within the unit itself and not anything from negligence.  Come to find out the warranty company called and states that it was not a covered item due to "abnormal wear and tear" because too much lint had caused the fire.  I told the warranty that the technician didn't determine that when he came out.  So they encouraged me to call Premier and I did and was put on hold for about 10 mins because a lady answers.  I asked if I could get the report by the technician to see why it was contradicting what he told me on the visit.  She tells me that I have to get it from the warranty company.  I asked to speak to the technician and she proceeds to tell me "I am not pulling my technicians while they are working to ask them a question you can get from your warranty company".  I asked to speak to the manager or supervisor and she said Alex was on the phone and I asked her why they were refusing to cooperate and she tells me "Don't call back again" and hung up on me.  Soooo unprofessional and shady.  I remembered the technician had called me prior to arriving and called the number to see if he would pick up and he did.  After asking him, he pulled up his report and stated verbatim what he wrote "Electrical fire started from housing unit".  He stated there was not a word of anything to do with lint in his report and didn't know why it was submitted to the warranty company that way.  He was nice and stated he would look into for us and stated that there's no question it was not negligence on our part.
To say the least this company is horrible and needs to be out of business.  If you're thinking of using them "DON'T",  if you warranty company refers you to them, change companies.  I have never been treated so blatantly rude and unprofessionally.   Run, run, run from this company.  I even see a review from a former employee stating they are shady.  Now that's bad.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Nice technician, really wanted to post a positive review - but the customer service team was super unprofessional when i was resisting bailing out my washer for the 2nd time, for their 2nd visit, because on their 1st visit I was told it was good to go, but to just contact them if it happened again (which would require FILLING it again) she became aggressive and spitefully wouldn’t allow resignation to empty it again and 1) cancelled my appt, and 2) tried filing an incorrect report with my home warranty stating the washer wasn’t available for full diagnosis due to being full. . Fortunately, I was already on the phone with a supervisor at the home warranty co, so they knew it had been emptied for the 1st, and this was just spiteful behavior on their part about my original resistance to bailing it out again. I mean, I even begged them to let me show them a picture of it emptied. Oh well. Hone warranty company was fabulous.< /Review>< pics>

<Name>Roseen Fararji< /Name><Date>1610143602024<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>If I could give 0 stars I would as 1 star is giving WAY too much credit to these guys. I have been needing my stove top fixed for the past six months and every time they send a technician to my house he is missing a part and he has showed up six times now with a missing part. Clearly there is a lack of communication and employees are not trained to show up ready for their job. We expressed that we did not want the technician showing up every week unprepared due to Covid and not being safe and requested that next time he comes prepared and they did not seem to care or think anything of it. When I called to check on the status of my next appointment the lady that answered the phone answered frustrated as I expressed my complaint and threatened to hang up on me and then she did hang up on me. Afterwards I called back and they said they could not help me and my appointment has been rescheduled yet again but could not tell me what date. This obviously was frustrating again so I let her know how terrible their customer service is and she started yelling at me over the phone and said you’ve been reported to your home warranty company and we can no longer help you after delaying my issue for six months. Also, the service manager Alex is just as bad as his team of “customer service”, IF NOT WORSE. If they aren’t enough of a joke already, the bigger joke is him as the manager. This company lacks professionalism, customer service, and skills to complete their job, not to mention they don’t have an issue showing up to your house 6 times in a row during a pandemic just because they are unprepared. Absolute worst and complete joke.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>This service company was contacted by my appliance warranty. My ignitor on my Thermador was no longer working. The technician that came out said it was going to be such an expensive repair. He would be surprised if warranty service would cover it. After 10 days of no response between premier  and sears  warranty sears stated my repair was not covered. My husband and I as lay people YouTubed the issue  and contacted Thermador for replacement part $30. And was able to fix the issue in less than 20 minutes.
Do not do business with these people. Completely shady.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Horrible company,  stay away from this company, very bad customer service. They never call you back and they are so rude and dishonest, when I was trying to explain she was loud and hung up on me because after 3 weeks home warranty told me they have a part  and home warranty ask me to call and schedule with premier and she yelled at me no we don't  have a part .. I expected them to tell me they will call home warranty instead of being rude, yelled and hung up on me. Stay away from this bad company. I think they should  go and work in 3rd world countries not here. I wish I read the review before.< /text>

<text>Honestly, I wouldn't even waste my time with this company. It's a scam. They literally just show up, tell you they'll order a part and come back in a week then they never show up again. When you call they say its not their responsibility and the item is not repairable.</text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My experience was markedly different from the majority of the reviewers. I also was assigned this company by American Home Shield, and based on the reviews, I was concerned. But I got a pretty quick 1st appointment, and the phone conversations were polite and professional. The only issues I had were more with the length of time to complete the repair. My drier had a non standard part, and AHS had to order it, so it was almost 2 weeks from initial visit to completion, but that is not the repair service's fault.</Review>

<review>The operations manager Alex is rude and crude.  Their level of service is poor and incompetent.  I would never use them again.  I cannot believe they actually treat customers this poorly.  They mis diagnosed our problem and it ended up voiding our warranty and costing alot of money.  Beware of them, if you have Fidelity National Service and they recommend this company, ask for an alternative.  Bad, bad, experience<//review>< pics>

I used them through a old republic home warranty. The technician came in, did not turn on the washer at all. Was here for 2 minutes and left. He said that the part it’s very costly and labor intensive, then they send a report to insurance company saying is within normal working parameters of the washer. The person on the phone was very rude and not helpful at all< /Text>

I needed my refrigerator fixed,  and these guys were able to get it done in one day.  I've dealt with other technicians in the past,  but these guys were courteous and accommodating.  They first tried to service it but needed ti remapped the parts needed.  Luckily the parts needed were available and they had my fridge running in no time.  Will definitely be calling them again,  if ever I need anything else fixed.</Text>

STAY AWAY...SERIOUSLY...There's a reason that Premier Appliance Services has a 1.5 star rating. These people are rude, unprofessional and have no expertise. If you see a positive review, it's because Premier Appliance Services left it for them selves. The lady that generally answers the phone is one of the rudest people I've encountered. I had two encounters with 2 different issues with this lady (not by choice, but because my home warranty chose them for my area) and in both instances it was as if she woke up on the wrong side of the bed. She didn't listen, she kept on cutting me off and at the end she said "YOU KNOW WHAT? WE REFUSE TO SEND YOUR WARRANTY COMPANY THE REPORT". People....STAY AWAY....<//review>

I can’t believe how bad this company is. If I were you I would go anywhere except here. The service man did not even check my washer! Said don’t use it.... I have AmericanHomeShield and they won’t do anything until they hear from this company. It’s almost a week and still no diagnosis. Run don’t walk😡</Text>

HORRIBLE TO DEAL WITH!!! Trust me people if you are going as far as reading their reviews you should take it to heart! Our home insurance, Fidelity sent them out to us for a stove repair. BELIEVE what the others here have said about them! The service person Kip was fine but the office personnel is UNBELIEVABLY RUDE!!! Same as everyone else said, the female that usually answers is incredibly rude but it even got worse when she couldn't help me and put a male on. He didn't even care about helping me in the slightest bit. HELLO!!! Look at their Yelp reviews!!! That says it ALL!!! Should not be in business at all!<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Absolutely horrible experience!! I was referred to Premiere from our homeowners insurance to fix our refrigerator. The technician, Kip was great. He came out, looked at our refrigerator and diagnosed the problem as needing a fan but indicated the part would have to be ordered. It took 2 weeks and when he came out, he immediately said they ordered the wrong part. I called the office and they said they would try to put a rush on it. I then got a text saying it was expedited and it should be in by 10/2. I heard nothing from them and called the office on 10/3. I spoke to Liz and she said the part would be there in a day or 2 and scheduled the appt. for a week later. I told her it was not ok that we had to wait another week when it was their error. She said there wasn’t anything they could do as that was their next available opening. I told her that I have no choice to accept it but that it’s not okay and I would be notifying my home owners ins. company. As soon as I got the word insurance out, she hung up on me. She is the absolute rudest person ever. The technician came out today and said he couldn’t fix it because there is frozen ice and that we would need to defrost it first. Of course we were furious because they had been out on 2 previous occasions and they could have told us what to do. We called back to the office to schedule a follow up and we were told we would have to wait until the following Monday before they can come back out. I get there are issues that come up and mistakes happen however, their absolute disregard for good customer service is appalling. They should have taken steps to make it right and found a way to squeeze us in. We are going on 6 weeks of dealing with this and they have no concern for their customers. Even when you call, they offer no greeting and immediately place you on hold. The owner and managers should be embarrassed. DO NOT USE THEM!!!!!!!<//Review><user_name>K Ven<//user_name>< user>

<rating>1</rating><text>If I could give this company a -0 I would. My experience with them was absolutely horrid. I have never ever once written a review online of anything or anyone or any company. But my experience was so awful I felt compelled to do so. The staff is rude, dishonest and incompetent. They also wasted so much of my time going back and forth over an issue telling me one thing and then going back on it. I believe that American Home Shield uses them so that they will twist words, and deny claims. They didn’t even submit one of my claims because they decided that in their opinion it would get denied. The home warranty is the one to decide that not them. I am so incredibly disheartened that there are actually companies out there operating like this one. It’s such a shame. A true disappointment for an American company.</text>< pictures>

A technician came to diagnose my fridge 2 weeks ago. He said that he would order parts which take 3-5 business days. I called to check on my parts, and the Premier Appliance operator said they ordered parts, but didn’t know when they would arrive. That is a lie. If you order parts from any vendor, that vendor will tell you if parts are available and when they’ll be shipped. Premier Appliance has dropped the ball again. This is not my first claim where they provide a ZERO star service. I don’t know how they stay in business</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH!!
If you’re checking reviews because you were assigned Premier Appliance by your home warranty- Get on the phone & ask for a new company!!! I am a tenant BUT I also own a home with a home warranty(First American) & I have it in my contract that Premier Appliance is NOT allowed to work in my home- that is due to my experience with them in my own home in the past. Specifically their technicians are rude & lazy-  I still feel that way but my last experience is with the front office staff who are also rude & lazy-
I am renting a home that the owner uses Fidelity & when I called for service they sent Premier- I wanted to call & switch but I thought I should have an open mind- WRONG!!!!
It has now been 6 weeks, the parts for my repair are in after 3+ weeks and they couldn’t schedule me for over a week after the parts came in- (the service is now actually worse than what I remember!) I couldn’t be there the day they had so they wanted to reschedule for NINE days later!!  I was upset by that & asked to speak to the manager!! She yelled at me, told me I’m only the tenant & HUNG UP ON ME!!
Was a complete jerk- horrible customer service
The most horrible customer service I’ve ever experienced EVER from an appliance/repair type company-< /Review>< pictures>

<review>To be absolutely clear, I have no problem at all with the technician who did his job. The problem was in scheduling the first visit (took about 1 week after calling through the home warranty program) and then the technician didn't show up in the 3 hour window and I couldn't wait longer. Very poor communication and they kept say he would be there but didn't arrive. Came back 3 days later and had no information on the job so said he needed to get a part (new dryer cord) that would only take a few days. Well, it took 10 days to get the part, which was outrageous and then could only come to make the repair 5 days after that. And so, took nearly 1 month to get a new dryer cord. Awful customer service, long wait times by phone, poor communication, will never work with again.</review>< pictures>

<text>By far the worst company in the world. Liz is not only rude and condescending,  she laughs at you the entire time she’s talking to you, she interrupts, she cut you off and she is absolutely the definition of the worst customer service.
Whoever the manager is is also the rudest gentleman in the world. A complete inept company that deserves their one star rating. In fact they deserve negative stars. If your insurance company ever tells you that Premier appliance is coming out to your house cancel immediately and get someone else. Not only will you not be serviced, you will be talked
to rudely and not get anything done.< /text>< Pictures>

My experience with Premier was April 17, 2019 through May 30, 2019.The repair technicians that came out three times during this period were courteous and knew their work. The office staff not so much. One person(she , most times answered the phone when I called) got progressively rude and condescending throughout this service. My repair wasn't an easy fix, but that didn't warrant her attitude. I would not recommend Premier Appliance Services in Santa Ana based on the service I received from their receptionist/schedulers.</Review>

Technician came and said there’s no problem with our washer and when we start using it the same problem - water coming out of the washer. Then I called and follow up with their diagnosis for my home warranty to approve the repair or replacement. The lady from Premier Appliance is very scarcastic telling me we have up to the end of business day to report the diagnosis to American Home Shields. Called my home warranty Sunday and they have not submitted the diagnosis. Very Poor customer service.<//review>< pictures>

If possible , I would give them negative stars . They are the worst in business . I have  a Viking refrigerator that was broken and my home warranty company sent them .after one and half months and 3 visits by them my refrigerator is still not fixed . First it was inverter , replaced it and asked me to wait 24 hours . Instead of cooking fridge heated up . I called them they said turn the fridge off and call warranty company . ( yes , no ownership ) I called warranty company and scheduled another visit ( yes , they were sent back again) , then the tech says the compressor is bad  and replaced it .Fridge still didn’t work . I had to repeat the whole process again . On the third visit .technician says it’s control board that is bad . I am waiting for control board for a week now . I have no schedule from them on when they will come out .< /text>

If you are looking for fast service this is not the place. Took them a week to send someone out to us. Then another week to order a part. Then they broke something on our dryer so another week to order that part. Going on 4 weeks and we are still without a dryer.</review>

<Review>They don't even deserve a star. Worst company to work with. Person on the phone is rude and didn't wanna give any information even it's your own work order. I feel like if they don't wanna do the job they just make up there own notes. They person came to my place and told me what is wrong now they are saying nothing is wrong. It's been over the month and no update. And my warranty company has no notes so they can follow. No the case is closed they can't even tell me what parts I need.  So no help now and feel like they are just there to charge the insurance company's.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This is the most unprofessional company I’ve ever worked with. I have been without my oven for three months that’s including on Thanksgiving and Christmas day.  Thanksgiving because they didn’t bring all the parts.  Even though after they replaced the parts the oven worked for a few days and it went out again.The repair person came out today and it still not working.  He’s going to replace the same part a third time it’s been replaced twice.  I called the office to see what the next steps are because the technician left without telling me he said he was going to talk to his supervisor and she asked me what did I want them to do?!?!?!?  So unprofessional. I said I just want my oven working.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.  Terrible service terrible< /text>

Worst company ever they told me they were going to order parts and never did they never contacted me again. When I inquired with American home shield I was told to contact Premier again to find out more information when I complained to American home shield the big that they had not ordered the parts and have not contacted me they ended up terminating my contract and hanging up on me. They then reported to American home shield that it was a pre existing condition and should not be covered under my warranty. To American home Shields credit they did send out a second  Technician.. I will never use premiere again< /text>

Unprofessional company.  Their technicians have no knoledge of customer service or repairing or appliances.  They will give you excuse and excuse and still wont repair the issue.  They will then blame anyone they can.  They will take your money and not do any service that was paid for.  They will also watch a young woman try and move an appliance because they are too lazy to do the job they are paid to do.  Who does that.  If you used this company from AHS you should drop that warranty company also.  If they contract companies that have this bad of ratings on google and yelp they are not a company you can trust for protection.< /text>

Worse repair company I have ever dealt with.....the support staff will lie to you about anything just so they are not at fault. They are rude and will threaten you to NOT send out a technician. First service call for an oven was Dec 4th, technician diagnosed problem as a defective sensor. Company ordered sensor and technician returned on Dec 22nd with the incorrect part. Another part was ordered and the technician returned Jan 14th and replaced the sensor. Now, Feb 5th, I am waiting for the technician for the exact same problem. I received a text message from Premier Appliance Service stating the technician would be here between 2PM and 5PM. I called PAS at 5PM and was told I was wrong and the time was changed to between 3PM and 6PM. I received this revised text message when I was on hold with their employee on the phone. Then I was told that I as never scheduled between 2PM and 5PM. Incompetent, rude, lying, threatening, worse people I have ever dealt with.< /Text>

<Review>I agree with rude staff and lire technicians. Technician came through American Home Shield and diagnosed that the transmission leaks and motor needs to be replaced due to excessive noise. He took a picture of the bottom of the machine to submit to AMHS, It took 14 days after inspection and several phone calls to submit their diagnosis to AMHS  But his diagnosis to American Home Shield was there is no mechanical failure. If I had the choice give them no star I would have done that. I feel the technician expected a kick back money to send the correct advise to AMHS.  AMHS needs to review all these comments from several people and remove them from their vendor list.<//Review><pics>None</pics></record>

<review>I was referred to Premiere Appliance Services by my home warranty company.  I love the fact that home warranty provides coverage in the event that our appliances fail and our stove happened to fail.  The technician that came, named "JL" on the invoice was absolutely delightful!  It was raining hard when she came, and my kids were crowding her when she arrived but she handled it very professionally and caring!  She diagnosed our stove problem as an issue with the clip that connects the stove to the oven and said that they would order the parts and have it installed at a later date.  At that point, I didn't mind because our technician was nice.  11 days later, an electrician comes to our home looks at the stove, the trouble codes, and diagnoses it as a clip for the oven as well, but says that that's not his field... it's an appliance repair person's field (wow, who would have thought!).  It's obviously not the electricians fault because he was responding to a work order.

I call Premiere Appliance Services to make sure that this wasn't a mistake on their end, but I am deducing that it is because the technician that originally served our home ("JL") wrote down a note on her paperwork that didn't match what she had vocalized to my wife and I at the time of the diagnosis.  Bummer!  When I called, Rebecca was quick to answer, but when I shared about the problem that came as a result, she referred me to call our home warranty company to rectify the issue.

I understand that the only way to process repairs is by having our home warranty company act as middle-person between us and the companies that are out there that repair.  I proceeded to ask Rebecca if she could check with the worker to confirm that this was a miscommunication on paperwork and that we could just get the appliance part or work something out where we could have our stove repaired quicker.  Rebecca mentioned that the paperwork says that we "need an electrician" therefore, "the company can't be wrong in this manner".  I shook my head and followed that statement with, "are you saying that you guys can't be incorrect at all? Couldn't the technician tell you that the issue wasn't an issue with electrical but an oven clip?"

Her response was, "no, it's not wrong, you can read the paperwork."

I suppose that you can assume that I am lying about an oven clip needing to be replaced because I am knowledgable about oven clips disabling stove tops rendering them inoperable (sarcasm). I had no idea that the oven clip was an issue and that something like that could prevent our stove from working!

At this point I was upset because I knew I was going to be left with the resolution of waiting an undisclosed amount of days before our oven would be fixed.  And secondly, I was upset that Premiere Appliance Services couldn't admit even the possibility of writing a misleading note on their service document that conflicts with the diagnosis that the technician presented us with.  I told Rebecca that "It sucks that your company is unable to help us rectify the issue or even contact the technician to clear all of this up.  It makes me feel like your company doesn't care about their clients."

In all fairness... maybe they place us "home warranty" people in a different category because we are going through warranties and insurance... BUT I was left with a glimmer of hopefulness because "JL" from Premiere Appliance Services was remarkably efficient and cordial with her work... but Rebecca quickly shattered all hope I had in this company with her response, "I'm sorry that you feel that way."

I quipped back, "well, that's not an apology, that sounds like an apology for my feelings as opposed to..." I couldn't even finish the sentence because she cut me off.  After she ranted (appropriately) about my need to call home warranty again and reschedule everything she concluded our conversation with, "have a nice day" and hung up.

I suppose that this is the reason why they are reviewed at the grade displayed online. I really hope Rebecca has a nice day, although she has spoiled mine.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>Worst Service Imaginable.  I would never use them if I didn't have American Home Shield.  1st time out they forget to order the part from AHS.  2nd time out they fix one issue but break something else.  3rd time out they send the wrong technician.  4th time they schedule the wrong technician and have to cancel the day before.  5th time the technician has a family emergency and cannot make it.  Still waiting for freezer to get fixed since October (It's now January).

Update,  6th time out the technician says they need to order a new part for the freezer door that they broke that no longer opens.  After leaving they then report to American Home shield that nothing is broken and they have closed out the order.   Absolutely mind blowing how bad this company is.  Straight up thieves and liars.</Text><time>1548452072249<//time>< UserId.>

Worst Company Ever! The technician came out on a AHS service call for our washing machine. he spent 5 minutes and told me it was the bearings and that he needed to have the parts ordered. When he wrote the report he told AHS that it was a pre-existing condition and should not be covered. Serviceman was a lying POS. I would never trust this company. To AHS credit they are sending out a different company because they said there was a huge problem with the report from Premier.</review>

They said to work the diagnosis first and give the estimation later.  If no services, they only charge $29.99,  however they didn't give the reason for repair and just want $150 to fix it.  I can not see any repair or replace parts so that no repair was happened they still want me to pay $150.  Basically, the first time repair has 25% deduct but they reject it.< /Review>

<username>Anandou Vinayagam< /username><text>Google isn't allowing to give zero rating,
otherwise I would give it, here is why? American Home Shield Warranty company assigned Premier Appliance Services to repair my oven and microwave, a technician named JL came to our house on 12/14, just spent less than 10 mins to diagnose the problems, without removing anything she very confidently said a switch inside the microwave isn't working and a temperature sensor isn't working for Oven, she will order both parts once she get authorization from AHS, I did reconfirm the diagnosis with her and she did assure me that two parts will be replaced but on next day AHS charged me $100 service fee and closed the service request as complete, today I called AHS to check why they closed the request, they told me that this service company reported (a total lie, I have receipt with, nothing written like that) that Oven is working as expected and Microwave isn't working because of physical damage caused by us. I then called this service company and enquired about why the technician told us something and reported to AHS completely different, the manager was very rude, he didn't answer my questions rather asked me to talk to AHS and hung the phone on me. I did talk to AHS, they told me that there is nothing they can do about this as they are standing by what technician reported to them. I am planning on canceling my contract with AHS, i will not hire this company or recommend to anyone.<//text>< rate>

<text>Bad experience with this company to get my dishwasher fixed,each time I had to pay the 75.00 service fee and within few months it stops working. American Home shield uses this inexperience company to fix appliances  I just cancelled all 3 of my home warranty with American Shield because they use these inexperience company. My advice to everyone-If  you have Home warranty with American Shield, let them know in advance not to send this company for service, these tech will  tell you something and write totally different on their report.</text>< Time>

I was forced by American home shield to use these jokers. The tech didn't even address the door leak on my dishwasher and went off on some errant hunt to void my warranty.

Avoid this company at all costs. And shame on American shield for using a company such as this< /Text>

Awful company from dispatch, to not knowledgeable technician and rude so called Manager.
They did not know what Broiler is and told my wife the oven bulb is out! Yes, and that took another 2 weeks for special order.
I was given the run around for a month and a half before they decided that they can't fix it.
Cheesy company selected by home warranty company American Home Shields.
That's another joke of it's own.
Finally, Profe Fix Appliance Service came and fixed it on the spot.< /Text>

This is a dishonest company to deal with. If you are using them through your home warranty request they be placed on a "do not send" list. They charged me for an unnecessary repair that they didn't even perform.<//Review>

At this time we feel we have done our job properly compliant to the warranty guidelines that are provided to us and you agreed with the charges.

<Date>1482338431279< /Date><rating>1<//rating><Text>Worst experience ever. I ended up with them because they were assigned to me by my home warranty company. WHEN they finally came out, they said they fixed my refrigerator. Five days later, my freezer food was melted on the floor and I lost all of my food. Their attitude was that they would get to it when they got to it. The next visit resulted in "we have to order parts" and that will take days. I am now going on 3 weeks without a working refrigerator. It appears to me that that if you have a warranty contract, you are on the bottom of their list. What a HORRIBLE way to conduct business!!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Absolute nightmare how the employees handle the customers. 10 days for 1st appointment, they claimed that I didn't answer the door when I was home with a dog who barks and they wouldn't come back for another 10 days, then the technician was yelling "HELLO, HELLO" while standing in front of my garage instead of walking around to my front door.  He got my dishwasher running however as soon as I tried to start it the next day, it wouldn't start.  They never returned my calls to fix or replace it again. American Shield said that Premier Appliance stated there was a foreign object in my dishwasher, yet the technician said that he cleaned the lines, then Premier said the foreign object was grease lol.
Then the warranty said they will tell Premier to fix or replace it and now Joanna at Premier hung up on me because they have to wait for the warranty company to call them, they don't call the warranty company.
Over a month to fix or replace a dishwasher, ridiculous and torturous process.  Don't buy a warranty, just pay a normal company and save yourself the agony of dealing with rude, foreign employees that don't speak English or behave normally on the phone.  Beyond bizarre!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>Same person as everyone else mentioned, Alex, the manager gave us the run around.

One of their employees came to service a dishwasher for us, told us the dishwasher has a common problem and a new panel will fix it. He gave a fake diagnosis to the Warranty Company knowing that we would have to duke it out with the Warranty company. When we called them to ask what happened, his employee hung up on us. The second time we called, spoke with Alex. He said “that’s the diagnosis I gave them, you don’t like it, too bad!” And also hung up on us.

We have a photo of the invoice that says differently. The ONE non one-star rating they have is obviously someone that works for them to bring them up from a straight 1-Star rating. Use the power of reviews, this place doesn’t deserve to be in business and you should avoid them at all costs until they are out of business.<//Text>< pictures>

I got there after being closed because of pandemia (Friday 7 may) and to be honest there were not attractive girls at the moment only overweight ones and not that pretty maybe after a while they would hire better ones.

<Review>Rio Gentlemen's Club is the classiest entertainment establishment in Los Angeles. The girls here are all tall hot with amazing bodies. The best time to come here is during the day on a week day. The ladies are less busy and you will get the attention you want. Take care of them and you will have a great time. Drinks are pricey.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Inside is a well designed club layout with 2nd floor    For extra bar and dance area. People dine here early evenings before partying too.

Waitresses are very attractive with dancers a plenty! Get quality dances here without the pressure of buying champagne for private entertainment.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Then she has the nerve to say aren't you going to tip me i told her i tipped you before the dance started she said but i worked hard i told her i didn't even get my full 30mins and then she was like oh now you're gonna start to complain.

Most of the girls are over weight, or looks like they are strung out on drugs, only like 2 good looking girls. Went here a few nights ago, and got a happy ending in the vip room for cheap, I was offering full price but she only wanted half, I think her name was Renny or Remmy. Wasn’t that attractive but hey, what would you expect from a club that looks like this.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend it, there is no good atmosphere and they take away your shopping time, for example you ask for a vip of 15 min and they only give you 10 it is a fraud

I thank God for Glenda!!! She’s saved my day and my hair ❤️ I’m from ny/nj and couldn’t believe the outrageous prices barbers are charging out here in the bay and they can’t even cut with scissors. She’s excellent with clippers and scissors and charges a very nominal price. I recommended both of my neighbors to her who were also looking for decently priced fades. Highly recommended!!!< /Review>

I had 3ft of long, thick hair. Most salons take one look at my hair and for some reason look bothered just to cut it. I was recommended this place by a family member and I am SO GLAD I went. She was SO NICE and cut it just the way I wanted it. She was happy to help me. My hair was so long that unfortunately she had to essentially sit on the ground to cut it, but she did not show hesitation or the slightest hint that she was annoyed. AMAZING customer service and a clean professional cut. I highly recommend this place to anyone!</Review>

Every time I get my nails done I come to this salon. Today in particular I came into the salon and Vivian helped me out. She was extremely nice and extremely patient with what I wanted. I usually like my nails to be extravagant, when Vivian put on the simple white acrylic it looked so good I just told her to add some glitter and that would be just perfect! They came out so amazing I am extremely pleased with the service Vivian provided me. I think I found my new favorite nail tech! Thank you so much Vivian I will see YOU in two weeks!</Review>

Excellent pedicure experience today. I got the deluxe pedicure, added French tip.  Very clean salon with all the extra safety precautions for Covid. I love how efficient the staff is. Very friendly and welcoming as well.<//Review>

Second they did whatever they wanted with my nails.  Lastly they say a price and then they give a totally different price from what they had told you before.  I will certainly not ever going back there again<//Review><pics>None< /pics><username>Paris Villegas< /username>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Okay so I usually go to Rivernail spa in the plaza next door but they couldn’t give me a walk in pedicure, so I decided to drive and try this place. Let me tell you, I was greeted with a kind smile, very personable and I’m not too sure if it was the owner but she asked me if I only wanted a pedicure? That they do hair, nails, everything! The salon it’s self is up to date, very appealing to the eyes and professional. So what think I found a new spot to become a regular at!!!<//Review>< pics>

I have been coming to this place for the last 3 years.  Although, I do not use a specific person for any services, any technician I have  had has always been super efficient, friendly and downright talented.  I enjoy my nail dates
with my bonus kid every month and we ALWAYS come to Meriden and I always refer my friends here.  10/10 HIGHLY recommended...< /Review>

<Review>This is my first time here with my sisters and my nieces (group of 6) . Had an app it they were very prompt about getting us in as soon as we arrived for the appointment. Receptionist is extremely polite and professional and walks around shop to make sure everyone is taken care of and things are going smooth. ❤️ Nail techs are polite as well and very gentle with their work . Highly recommend.< /Review>< Pics>

The staff and owners are always friendly and professional. The service they provide is great. My only issue is the callus removal could've been better. I felt a little rough the 2nd day. The salon is clean and very spacious.< /Text>

Kim was soo wonderful and very patient with me. i walked in 20 mins before closing and she greeted me so friendly and started working on my nails right away. She was extremely helpful as another nail tech was being extremely pushy on a service i was not inquiring about. Kim was so nice and understanding with my budget and made me feel so comfortable. I LOOOOOVE THE WAY MY NAILS CAME OUT!! they surpassed my expectations. i will absolutely be returning to Kim !!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)<//text>

The receptionist was great, but the nail tech seemed inexperienced, unfocused, painted my nails poorly, and cut multiple fingers. Very disappointed with my experience, would not recommend</review>

< Review>
The tech did an ok job. He didn't do the best at properly cleaning my nails. The gel was applied poorly so there was excess buildup around the edges of my nails. My nails were crooked so I had to fix it myself while at the shop and even more when I got home. He did a good job scrubbing my feet so that was a plus. I probably won't return but the salon is very clean and the staff very nice.</Review>

<Review>Would give it a 0 star if I could. One TWO occasions my appt started 1hr to 45m late. No accommodation, then the manicurist, Kelly, had the audacity to have an attitude when confronted about her horrible customer service. On both occasions, she made me late to work and a wedding because of her not being prompt. She also only gave me a $4 discount? Will not be going back and I don’t not recommend this place at all!!!!!!! Let’s not forget my nail broke after getting them done a day after....<//Review>< time>

< Review>
Super unprofessional! I came in for a fill and the receptionist told me 15 minutes. I went next-door, came back & sat down ...40 minutes later he came and asked me what I was waiting for. I reminded him that I told him I needed a fill he told me OK 10 more minutes. I sat down and waited. An hour Into waiting, one of the technicians comes and asks me to give her my hand, she looks at my nails and then just walks away no comment at all. Confused, I went to ask the person at the reception desk if they were even going to be able to see me... he just said you have to wait. While waiting I saw another person come in with no appointment and they were seen before me. A second person came in and said that they had a 5 o’clock appointment and the reception person told them that the person they had an appointment with, decided she wanted to go home so she would have to talk to her about that. Totally unprofessional and inconsiderate of other people’s time. If he had told me that it was gonna be an hour I would’ve gone to run my errands and gladly returned happily, but to tell your clients 15 minutes and then 15 minutes and then 15 minutes and have them waste their afternoon there is definitely a reason for me to not come back again!< /Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I would give zero if I could. I got a full set on Saturday,  and got uncharged for everything.  She left them so long and insisted doing a little pink powder when I asked for clear, and charged me $49 for a full set. I paid, whatever.  Next day, they are all lifting.  I go back today (Wednesday) to get them fixed and they don't want to do it because the technician that did them originally isn't there. I said I didn't want her doing them again,  so asked me to wait and when I finally see someone, she said she will fill it for $10. I am not paying again. She then just files off half my nail that is lifting and puts on clear polish. I asked if she was going to fill them and she said no because she wasn't who did my nails and they wouldn't pay her.  So I wasted 2 hours first day and another hour today for them to look WORSE!</Text>< Date>

<Text>I have been going to this nail spa for 5+ years and I have never had a bad experience. They even did my full set and pedicure for my wedding and it turned out beautifully. They don’t talk much or hold conversation but that’s perfect for me because I am completely antisocial. But I know The customers who are more social would have a problem with that.< /Text>< username>

<review>05/11/19 Ivy did an amazing job on my dip nails. I absolutely love the environment here. Will definitely be back.
Update on 06/09/19: this is 4 weeks and 2 days! Still not chipped and still look good. Going back this week to get my dip again. Absolutely love this place. All of their products are top notch. I highly recommend this spot. Thank you Ivy. See you soon.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8161GOlveS0DNu2SHX2_wPqohBr6Cie7vZuTs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I would not recommend this nail shop. It offers unlisted over priced services and VERY POOR QUALITY. On TWO separate occasions I had poor experience with the quality of my full set and dip powder. Shape and length non consistent on hands.

So I got a mani and pedi the Mani was from Kim and Kristy did my pedicure. When I first got there I told kristy I had a bad toe nail and she was so gentle and nice to my toe and she told me to tell her if it hurt. Then there is Kim who brought 10 colors over to try on the tester nails to try to match the color of nails I wanted she went above and beyond and asked me if I liked it a lot to make sure I was totally satisfied then brought over two different color of glitter. Before I showed her the design I wanted she showed me a beautiful one on her phone I loved the suggestions and I found my nail lady. Alice did my boyfriends pedicure she was gentle and kind and got rid of his calicuses it was his first time getting a pedicure and he loved it definitely going back with me again.The atmosphere was amazing as well the manager kept making the women laugh you can tell they love there job and it made it fun to be there< /Text>

I have been going to this salon for a year and Anna has done my nails for the last few times I have gone and she does an amazing job. She takes her time and makes sure that your nails are perfect and just how you like them. She has a heart of gold and really cares about her work. If you are there you should give her a try. She will definitely do right by you!</text>

Not worth what I paid. It's been a week and there's visible bubbles and peeling. And Kim wasn't very kind torse the end of the job. She kept telling me to go somewhere else cheaper as if they can't do better than what she did. I don't want cheap I want something thats worth it. And if that cheap shop got me right then so be it. But I will not recommend going here.< /Text>

Lady doesn’t know what “price” means and withheld their menu from me by covering up lower price service with her thumb suggesting services SHE wanted me to get. I asked her kindly to remove her thumb so I can see the other options... she continue to cover the lower prices so I walked out and went to organic nail bar across the street!! Organic mail bar is comfortable with nicer pedicure seats and less crowded. I spent $100 + and you know why.. because they gave me options to choose which leads to customers feeling in control which leads to bigger tips and happy customers .< /review>

I love them they are coffin shaped and easy for me to type on my computer but I wanted to get a ombré look. I told the lady who was doing it how I wanted them , she kept say yea every time I ask. At the end she just painted them one color. Maybe I should have show her picture of what I want. Non the less I’m happy with my nails. I will definitely go back.< /Review>< pics>

WORST PLACE EVER. DO NOT COME HERE.
We paid about $42 for a gel pedicure and let me tell you it was the worse pedicure I have ever received. My sisters nail polish completely peeled off not even a week later and she called on a Friday to let them know and they said she could walk in and they would fix it but when she showed up they said there was nothing they could do because it was their “policy”. I will never come here again.</Review>

Terrible job! They rush your nails, they don’t do it properly and instead talk to their friends in Mandarin all day. My mother got her nails done there and 6 days later two nails broke out of no where because they were very thin and weren’t done properly. Once she asked for them to redo them or get her refund they screamed at her and told her she can’t get it fixed because of a 3-5 day policy which is ridiculous. Furthermore the manager hung up in our faces after raising her voice and being highly disrespectful. DO NOT COME HERE! Terrible nail job and unprofessional customer service.</review>

<review>I came here for a pedicure snd manicure.  The pedicure was amazing.  The guy did such an amazing job on me, but the women on the nails was a completely different story.  She popped off my previous set carelessly,  ripped my middle finger nail, and cut the sides of my fingers w the file. I complained about the broken nail asking for them to fix it...The owner or manager or mom figure is a very disrespectful person who straight up told me I was complaing to get my nails done for free and that I can't afford it. What the hell kind of customer service is that</review>< Pictures>

<review>So I went in for a pedicure, signed in at the desk I'm pretty sure I was seen I'm the blackest thing standing at the desk. The receptionist was super rude didnt acknowledge that I existed, helped everyone except me, even the young lady that walked in AFTER me was helped & seated to a pedicure chair. I usually don't write reviews but that was unbelievable.< /review><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

<name>Ingrid Menjivar<//name><Review>I've never been to this nail shop before. My regular nail tech was booked, I needed something asap. So I decided to give Meridian a shot since all of the other local nail shops were extremely busy. The lady that did my manicure asked what color Gel I wanted, so I told her she grabbed the color No problem. She painted my Nails they were perfect. Lastly the lady that did my pedicure was also great but when she was done polishing my toes they were very streaky. I asked if she could even out the color. She looked upset and said this color(Yellow) is very hard to work with. She said "I can add 1 more coat". I told her that I wanted all of my nails to look the same and she just looked so upset. She did fix it. I would have just appreciated her telling me from the beginning that she didnt know how to work with the color I wanted. I've had Yellow nails before and its never been a problem.< /Review></record>

<Text>I went in for a gel manicure. Helen rushed through the whole thing. No work on my cuticles, no lotion added to my hands, no hand massage, just slapping on paint and powder as fast as possible. What's the point of paying for this? And because it was rushed it is poor quality. $40 not worth it. I Do Not Recommend this place!<//Text>< Pics>

I was very displeased with this place. It was my first time,  I told the girl I wanted my nails to be filed and she ended up using nail clippers and cutting them extremely  short. I recently stopped biting my nails and I was extremely proud of my long nails. Now I have short nails cause the girl did not listen to me. The “manager” came over and had a poor attitude, when I complained about the girl that messed my nails. They not only lost my business but my daughter’s and anyone we know.< /Text>

<review>They made nails way to thick and was uneven, had to fix them myself at home and when I took them off my nail was really stuck to the fake nail and it took off some of my real nail.< /review>< UserId.>

I went to the nail salon while on vacation. The nail tech cut my cuticles so low I started bleeding and my dip powder has started lifting and breaking. It hasn’t been two weeks and this has been going on since the first week of getting my nails done. I will NEVER go there again and I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

This place is good, however I called to order pizza and asked for what the flyer said on website, I for one could not underatand the gentleman he did not speak English and I do not speak spanish then he told me the flyer was old, I told him he should remove however he could not understand me, all around the experience on customer service was horrible all around (not everyone speaks spanish), they really need to update their flyers online and gramt customers wat is displayed...I will not be returning to this location< /review>

<text>I arrive at this special place once a month since I love the good air that is part of this place. The crew is highly loyal and experienced. The service is impressively quick. Needless to say, the food they cook is magnificent. I came often and I was never disappointed. The payment is modest. I recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.<//text>< username>

<text>You can eat inside or outside. The biggest change is, you order at your table and then pay (so you better get it right the first time, lol). Although service was great and didn't wait much for my food, the soup was cold. Relied on the fire to heat it up, but it only went so far... so that brings me to a 4 star.<//text><Rating>4</Rating>< Name>

I would recommend this place if your bringing family or just big gatherings. The plates that you order are usually shareable, because of the big portion. Since its COVID there is no dine in, but there is out door dining. You order than they will give you your receipt so that you can pay before you get the food. It does get very busy and the parking is hectic. Plan accordingly 😌 👌<//text>

<text>Oh my god this soup is so good. This place feeds the soul! It is super barebones so don't expect anything fancy but this way the food shines over all. We get the soup with brisket and extra noodles. It comes with kimchi and delicious rice that you dip into the soup. The service is friendly and warm. Will return regularly to satisfy our Korean soup cravings!<//text>< pictures>

<text>I bough a sea food soup, white rice, beef on a stick, and bbq pork ribs. They were ok. it's better when you dine in as the food is hot. Soup taste gross when it gets cold. Lastly make you check all your items before you leave. They tend to forget an item. This is in the morning when they don't have any customers.</text>< rating>

Mmmmmmm. My new favorite thai in CA, ties with Lers Ros but for different dishes. The pork belly salad is a must order and is my new benchmark for what $13 is worth. Everything is delicious, especially their chef specials and more unique dishes. Even thai food aficionados will find something new and tasty here.< /Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>I used to really love this place, unfortunately over the years the food quality has dropped. The orange chicken is not what it used to be and the shrimp and mushroom soup has lost its quality. I can say it is better than many thai places but for some who has been coming here for 22 years I was able to witness the quality become poor.</Review>< Pictures>

Services was horrible
When we arrived we got sat fast they  brought out our drinks first.  Our food took more than 15 min it was cold when we got it. I complained and they took our food away and made us wait another 10 min for our food. This restaurant needs better customer services . Food was pretty good .<//Text>

< Review>
Food Was Decent However The Service Was Less Than Welcoming.  Upon Ordering Our Drinks Were Forgotten And Our Main Dishes Arrived As If The Chef Had Anticipated Our Order.  Our Order Arrived Within Minutes Of Us Sitting Down. We Left After The Waitress Literally Walked By And Placed Our Check On The Table.  Didn't Ask If We Were Done Or If We'd Like Anything Else. Didn't Bother To Ask If We Wanted Any Boxes For The Leftovers, Nothing.  She Was Very Stoic And Expressionless. We Left The Leftovers There, Paid And Walked Out.  Never Coming Back.<//Review>

<username>Jaz Ramirez< /username><review>I used to really love this place, unfortunately over the years the food quality has dropped. The orange chicken is not what it used to be and the shrimp and mushroom soup has lost its quality. I can say it is better than many thai places but for some who has been coming here for 22 years I was able to witness the quality become poor.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b89dfb672b09:0x2927d7051ad4f9ff</Gmap_id>< Time>

<review>Food Was Decent However The Service Was Less Than Welcoming.  Upon Ordering Our Drinks Were Forgotten And Our Main Dishes Arrived As If The Chef Had Anticipated Our Order.  Our Order Arrived Within Minutes Of Us Sitting Down. We Left After The Waitress Literally Walked By And Placed Our Check On The Table.  Didn't Ask If We Were Done Or If We'd Like Anything Else. Didn't Bother To Ask If We Wanted Any Boxes For The Leftovers, Nothing.  She Was Very Stoic And Expressionless. We Left The Leftovers There, Paid And Walked Out.  Never Coming Back.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2b89dfb672b09:0x2927d7051ad4f9ff<//GmapID><user_id>117552590576435048549< /user_id>< Pictures>

Don't eat their food!! I took the combination fried rice for my wife to go and when she was eating at home I found this. They were close by the time I was going to take the food back.</text>

this place is so sketchy, the food is good , but the servers are real bad ! they treat you with no respect. i told them my soup was cold and they looked at me bad and spoke in a different language in a mean way and left. gives me no security about the food that is coming back to me. they could have said sorry or atleast gave me a excuse. but no just spoke a different language and left.</Review>

Very delicious food also wonderful service. I've been coming here for years an the food never disappoints me. My son enjoys the seafood soup with steamed rice very delicious, he can't get enough of it. The rice noodle, Chow Fun with shrimps and Chinese broccoli is tasty.< /text>

< Review>
This place is flat-out the best, fantastic, outstanding, magnificent all in one. The 7 Mares soup here is supper, added with a side chili they have there, it's the best! I honestly love this place, I've been coming here for the past 13 years and even though I have moved on from the area I still find the time to travel just to eat there.<//Review>

The service is unfortunately the as it was the last time. Exprimidle poor,due to way they think about making money not giving a good service. Can’t blame the food.!<//Review>

<review>I always go to the one in Vermont but I accidentally ordered over the phone to this one so I just picked it up. I asked them if the food was fresh and hot and they said it just came out so I said hey great and paid the 65 dollars .they hand me the bags and go to my car and start driving but I had a feeling it was not hot so I decided to check it so I pull over and the food was warm more on the cold side. Had to be out for over 40 minutes. I told them I was going to pick the food at a specific time so that I didn't get cold food and yet they still took the food out way before I asked. Never coming here again. I'll stick to the Ocha on Vermont.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Small parking area. Can be a wait depending time of day. Weve waited up to almost 2 hours once. But great food! So worth it! And they have more places than this one and yet STILL VERY IN DEMAND</Text>

<Review>Average food and service. I wasn't really impressed by the food quality. The chicken dish had very little actual chicken in it but was marked up to over $10 for the entree. Seems to get a crowd that doesn't care about it being high quality. Mostly immigrants that don't have lots of money for their big night out.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Ocha is one of my favorite l.a restaurants
Staff is like what ever they get a lot of the order wrong but it does t matter cause usually it's the drinks only.
This specific place doesnt get too crowded so that good

But ur not there for the staff or the environment. You ate there for their 7 mares soup, mixed chowmin , and rice .... if u live in l.a u must eat here at least once</Review><username>Luis Gonzalez</username><Date>1562684577408< /Date><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Good place for food. It's a little expensive base of the presentation of the food but it is what it is. Over all 4/5
Side note, the waiters are fast and very attentive to everyone.<//Text>

<review>I went here with a friend. We had the Shrimp with Cashew Nuts and Chili and Spicy Beef Bamboo Shoot with coconut cream. Both were good and delicious. Food serving is good for two person. We end our meal with Thai ice coffee.<//review>< pics>

The food was incredible! As someone who lived in Thailand a few years ago, I found Nan to be really a very very good, authentic place. Not sure I agree with other reviews regarding the decor though, I found it plain and boring. The most recent time we were there, the service wasn't perfect, but still good.
My recommendations are the sea bass and the lamb shank. And steal some of your neighbors curry sauce for diversity.</Text>

Good food and decent ambience. Reasonable price and service. Trouble is waiting, they seem understaffed when it comes to attend to the long queue waiting outside, to be seated...wish they  could do something about that. I visit here once a month or two as it is close to where I live. Visiting since 2014.< /Review>

Fried rice tastes like Vons boxed rice. Cat Fish is hard and chewy. Service is slow and servers are disrespectful. This place used to be very good. My father met the owner back in the 80’s and my dad loved the food. Now he comes back today and says what am I eating. Very bad restaurant. The only “classic” and “traditional” thing about it is the look nothing else really. This food is not authentic Thai. Go to a Thai House in Monterey Park, now that’s authentic Thai.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Food is acceptable but the restaurant is dingy looking.
The parking is a nightmare and sometimes the wait is too long.
Prices a great versus quantity.<//Review>

The place is kind of run-down looking.

There is a wide variation in quality of the food. Some dishes look and smell great, and others don't. It seems like the same dish varies a lot from one day to the next.< /Review>

Parking is bad, service is ok, but the food is excellent and from the time you order to the time food is served is minutes, i’ve been there two times and i have to say that at the moment this is the best Thai place.
02/26/29, from 5 stars down to 3 stars due to some technicalities, somebody is dropping the ball, portions are not the same, MY pineapple fried rice barely had pineapple.  It is becoming average, i need to find another thai place!!!< /review>

The food was bland and not freshly prepared. Ordered pork with garlic and basil but ended up getting chicken with garlic and basil leaves. Ordered the Thailand signature chillies and fish sauce, but was served a sauce similar to green chillie sauce. The restrooms were filled with graffiti.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The service was horrendous, and the food even worse than the service. The food is pre-made, and the sea food soup smelled extremely bad. I don’t get how this restaurant can have good reviews because it isn’t worth spending so much money on food that doesn’t taste good or smells good. The place is also dirty, the bathroom extremely disgusting.</Review>< Pictures>

Terrible service I barely rate a place, but everytime i want to give another chance at this place, the service worsen..  Lack of good customer service.  Almost as if they dont know how to treat customers. Idk if its a culture or language issue but, why will you deny service or waiting seat to anyone who has been waiting and hr for service. Mind you quiet and patient.< /Text>

Bad service I waited 5 mins and no one noticed me Until I had to ask for the manager for assistance. And they were not busy with waiters standing around . The food is really good but service is so so. I would deff. go by myself , I wouldn't recommend this place to friends being that you may get emburressed for recommending it to your friends with such bad service.. I've been once before and the same thing the serive was so so< /text>

(Translated by Google) The quantity is generous and the price is low. There is a parking lot, but if there are many cars, you have to wait. Staff are friendly.
Tomyangkung is the main. It is characterized by adding coconut.

(Original)
양이 푸짐하고 가격이 저렴하다. 주차장이 있지만 차가 많으면 기다려야한다. 직원들은 친절하다.
똠양꿍이 메인이다. 코코넛을 넣은 것이 특징이다.< /text>

(Translated by Google) The two Thai restaurants add to the typical American Powerhouse Restaurant!
Great value for money
The menu is varied and suitable for wider space can accommodate guests for groups to the top
The food is not special at all and alright!

(Original)
전형적인 아메리칸 차이니스 음식점에 태국음식이 추가된 레스토랑!
가격대비 양이 푸짐하여 가성비가 훌륭합니다
메뉴도 다양하고 손님을 수용할수 있는 공간이 넓어 단체손님이 가기에 적합합니다
음식은 전체적으로 특별하진않고 무난합니다 !<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is always excellent, the only problem now is that your aces will not serve you without your pages beforehand, and for that you have to make a big line, if you want to order something else, you must go to that line so that they can serve you, they are very bad horganisados ​​definibamente if one has to eat there you have to arrive without anbre so that when you can order I pay it you have an appetite in all that process

(Original)

(Translated by Google) The food is good in the place, they are good the dishes that they serve, good products, they have quality and quantity. The staff takes good care of you only that they put pressure on you at the time of ordering.
Take the time that you think it is necessary to read the wide menu that they offer, since it is not easy to choose one of the almost 100 that come in the menu.
I recommend the 7 seas, the cold thai and the noodles whether you order them with any type of meat or vegetables.

La comida es buena en el lugar, son buenos los platillos que sirven, buen productos, tienen calidad y cantidad. El personal te atiende bien solo que te presionan un poco a la hora de ordenar.
Tomate el tiempo que tu creas necesario para leer el amplio menú que te ofrecen, ya que no es fácil escoger una opción de entre las casi 100 que vienen en el menú.
Te recomiendo el 7 mares, el the frío thai y los noodles ya sea que los pidas con cualquier tipo de carne o verduras.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) We visit this place from time to time, I really like their food they have a lot of variety, the food is always hot, they constantly offer you water, they have public toilets that are clean, but what I notice is that now they put less vegetables in the rice or in the chao min, also less shrimp in the 7 seas, if before they were 4 now they are only 2.

A service dog is state certified and must bring a badge ...
The food was 2 than 3

(Translated by Google) Aaaah is not a good place, there are better in this type of food. I really do not recommend it. There are many things found, 1) parking is limited. 2) they pressure you to eat fast so you can vacate the table and then the waiters are not friendly and do not allow you to tip the few Latinos who work there picking up dirty dishes and cleaning the tables.

(Original)
Aaaah no es un buen lugar, hay mejores en este tipo de comida. En verdad no lo recomiendo. Son muchas las cosas encontra, 1) el parqueo es limitado. 2) te presionan para que comas rapido para que desocupes la mesa y luego los meseros/as no son nada de amables y no te permiten darle propina a los pocos latinos que trabajan ahi recogiendo las platos sucios y limpiando las mesas.</Review>
