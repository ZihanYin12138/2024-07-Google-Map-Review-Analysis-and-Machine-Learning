I had another shop not far from this one (also strangely with the word 'Autowerkes' in their name) try and quote me nearly $1,000 for a simple transmission fluid replacement and filter change after holding on to my car for nearly 9 hours.

These guys not only did the job in record time, but it was less than half the cost of what the other shop wanted. I very much appreciate Doug and Brian's work ethic and professionalism. Valley Autowerkes is my trusted local mechanic shop.</Text>

My audi a4 2.0t timing chain came loose. They were able to get me in and back on the road in 2 days. They were very professions, honest,  and did great work on my car. I paid $1100.00 for new timing chain and tentioner..They updated me everyday and texted me as soon as it was ready.

I would  recommend valley Autowerks to everyone with a audi..

fyi:Audi of temecula wanted 2x more than that and tried to get me to trade in my car and upgrade..<//Text>

<Text>Valley Autowerkes has been my go-to auto mechanic for years.  They earned my trust the very first time I brought a vehicle there several years ago.  And since that first time, they have never let me down.  They have always completed quality work in a timely manner.  I never even think about going somewhere else.</Text><date>1601918185638<//date><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

We have had Doug take care of everything for my first BMW  2001 350i and now my 328 2011.   Always feel great with Valley Autowerkes. They also took care of our Toyota Tundra not long ago.  I can’t imagine going to anyone else.   Wonderful group of professionals.<//Review>

I have been going to Valley Autowerkes for many, many years.  My kids take their cars there as do many of my friends. Doug runs an honest shop, never tries to get you to do work that isn't necessary.  Brian is a great mechanic  and the prices are very fair.</Review>

Being from out of the area, I was choosing blindly looking for a shop and I’m glad I chose Valley Autowerkes. Not only did they take in my car same day that afternoon, but they got the parts in overnight, and had me up and running and on my way back to Fresno by early afternoon the next day.

Valley Autowerkes was highly recommended to me. I waited months to bring my car in due to the pandemic, and it was worth the wait. Doug has been very professional and honest throughout the entire process. He expedited a part needed from the east coast, and was able to complete the work the same day I dropped off my vehicle. I definitely recommend Valley Autowerks and they gained a loyal customer.

I've been looking for an honest shop that is equipped to work on range rovers in the area, I finally found it. Great service!  They do not tell you its problem #1 for this $ and then later say well its that plus #1, #2, & #3 for $$$$$ like another range rover equipped shop in the area does.
I also liked that they inspected my vehicle (brakes, tires, belts, hoses, seals, ext.)  and gave me a list of things that may need to be replace in the future and things that are in good shape. This is a shop for keeps.<//Review>

I have been taking my car to Valley Autowerkes since I bought it. A 2008 Volvo. Doug and his guys are so diligent and kind and easy. They send me email reminders when it is estimated that my mileage is at a point for service. I check the mileage and, if so, make an appointment and take it in. They are great. I find their prices to be fair and reasonable too. Doug is an expert at pacing needed repairs and major maintenance to coincide with my budget. This is invaluable to me as it allows me to plan for major repairs. I never feel surprised.  I have never looked around since I found them. I highly recommend Valley Autowerkes! You cannot go wrong with them!</review>

<Review>As always..... we are so well taken care of. We love to come back time and time again, despite the fact that we live almost two hours away!
There is no feeling like knowing you are in good hands. Trust is invaluable.
We are grateful for this experience and we are looking forward to many more in the future. Thank you!

<Review>We’ve been taking our 1996 318i to Doug since 2006. We’ve been very satisfied with all the work that Valley Autowerks’s has performed from replacing our engine to a simple oil change!</Review>< pictures>

Doug is a stand up kinda guy. trustworthy and fair. on a secondary note, nice people associate with nice people. when he found something wrong with my car that he couldn't fix, he sent me down the street to Dyno Transmission. As soon as the transmission is remedied, the car is coming straight back to Doug. First Class.< /text>

I took my VW Jetta to the VW dealer for an electrical problem and the dealer couldn't find the problem twice.  Doug found it within an hour and had my car back on the road in no time.
My other car needed a new turbo and Doug took care of it.   I can always trust that he will do what is necessary to do an excellent job.
I recommend Doug and Valley Autowerkes to all my friends.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Hats off! Took my Volvo S60 into Doug for a radiator & coolant hose replacement and couldn't be happier. Bottom-line, Valley knows the European cars and does the work right at less than you would pay at other shops. Highly recommend and will only think of one shop when my Volvo needs more repairs.<//Text>

Terrible. I cant give no stars so one it is. Still running into issues from repairs this shop made. Silicone happy shop. Two mechanics from two different shops found issues (leaks) from work this shop did. Both those mechanics said someone fixed the issues with silicone. The issues were my valve cover gasket and my coolants flange . Probably more mickey mouse work somewhere else. Bring it to his attention and Paul will deny it. I even brought him the part replaced to show him it was done at his shop. My patience was tested with this shop. I will say after some arguing Paul offered 300$ credit. But check this out, i go in for an oil change and brake job and they find something else that needs fixing that amounts to more than I expected. If I recall it had something to do with my turbo but I may be wrong. Anyway, he'll get his money one way or another. Shame on me for not doing the work myself. Maybe the Master Mechanic was in a rush. So why write this review a year + later? Because I need my car maintenance and another mechanic runs into more silicone issues from work this shop made.  Consult at your own risk. Just my personal experience and it's only my opinion.</Text>

I cannot recommend this place highly enough.  My 2006 Volvo s40 is my baby, and I need her to be well-cared for.  Valley Autowerkes is the only place I will take her.  Paul and Doug are fabulous, honest, reliable and eager to do their best work for their customers.They always get me in quickly, and they always communicate well with me during the repair process. Their prices are competitive, and their work is superior.</Review>

The first time in to have breaks replaced, everything was good. When I went back for a fuse replacement & oil change, Mike was very harsh with me. He told me, they are not really an oil changing place and I should go to grease monkey or somewhere like that next time. Even though the have a sign saying if you post a review about them you will get a better deal on an oil change. I thought I found my mechanic, but I'll be looking for a new one< /text>

Brought in a 1983 VW Rabbit Convertible, these guys know their stuff, even the older VW's, the car drives like a new car.  I will definitely be back whenever the Rabbit needs work that I cannot do myself.  I enjoy working on cars but there are some jobs I don't have the tools to do, and these guys are great, very reasonable in price and the quality is excellent.< /text>

<Review>I just purchased a preowned BMW 750i and brought it to them for service because I wasn&#39;t interested in paying the dealers exorbinant prices. An oil change and involved multipoint inspection was just over a hundred bucks. Same level of service as the dealer with out all the fluffy butt kissing. Hell, the owner of the place even dropped me off down the street at a cigar lounge while I waited.  I will be back for sure! Thanks again guys!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Well let me begin that valley werkers allow my classic Volvo to remain on their property until my SSDI would arrive on the third of July the manager Doug was outstanding. They have done a lot of work in restoring my 1990 740 wagon and the price of repairs were very good and down to earth and they are honest people you could feel it. Thank you Doug and the mechanics at valley werkers.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Doug has always done the work on my 2003 VW Jetta TDI (no long have).  He was always fair and honest.  If went in for oil change and something was wrong he would advise.  Valley Autowerkes was the only place I took my Jetta for service.  When I get my new VW (when the 2017's come out) he will be the mechanic again (except for any warranty work--VW will handle.  If you don't want to deal with a dealership and their shenanigans, I would highly recommend Valley Autowerkes.....thanks for all you done for me and my Jetta (I will miss her).< /text>< Time>

Younger middle aged & mixed race couple walks in. Dressed casual. One works as a sheriff and one's a medical director unbeknownst to them. Looking at 5th wheels, etc. to take a blended family on road trips. Older salesman & perhaps owner gave a very dismissive vibe. As like a "you're wasting my time and interrupting me selling a destination trailer to a couple in their 60's, matter of fact" vibe.
Looking to purchase a Phoenix midsize 5th wheel with bunk beds for our kids, but he wasn't that interested in us at all. We will be purchasing from the RV seller in Newcastle instead. If you are younger, you may do better to Not waste their time at Capital RV Max, and subsequently your own time. P.S. I am also an official Google Local Guide.</text>

Visited them many times over the years before our purchase. Great all around service. Always helpful, knowledgeable, and professional, before and after our purchase.

Also got plenty of support/customer service which helped a ton.

Would definitely shop there again.

< Review>
I recently purchased an RV from this company. I read all these nice google reviews and I believed them.
I was told that the RV that I was purchasing for $21,000.00 cash would be completely gone through, inspected and necessary repairs made by the sales staff. I waited 3 weeks for delivery of my trailer to have the repairs made. Guess what? None of it was done. Oh sure it looked like work had been done but it was all cosmetic. As soon as I began using it (2 weeks later) I began a laundry list of all the repairs that were never done.
Listen, I could go on but the bottom line is that they did not deliver a good product, they are overwhelmed with the business that they have and never return phone calls. Especially if they know its a mistake that they have to make good.
Oh, they have a great line of BS to string you along but be forewarned most of what Mike the owner and Jenna (his daughter) tell you is a outright lie.
Maybe at one point they were good at what they do but that is most definitely not my experience.
DONT TRUST THEM!<//Review>

I have been shopping trailers for 6 months. I came back to RV Max to pick up the trailer that I really wanted. I Was stone walled on pricing and walked away but here is the aftermath;

•I was asking for a price that was WAY UNDER MSRP
•Staff helped me the whole way through no matter my reaction.
•I bowed out prior to tax changes. When I came back, they accepted my previous paper work and costing. 5 months on.

They are very fair. They will work with you on MSRP or Costing or financing. At the end of the day they will be fair with you on everything.

My last word is "FAIR". They are FAIR. if you want to try and screw someone over, go some place else. If you understand business come here. They will work with you honestly.

If You want to get a fair price for your trailer or fifth wheel come here. This group will treat you with respect and understand the end user.

Cannot heap more praise on the business.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><userid>104032396325754323392< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Great low-pressure dealer.  Tom, Mike and Ray were incredibly helpful and provided a level of customer service unmatched by their competitors.

The trailer was professionally detailed and clean at the time of pick-up. They worked with my schedule to arrange to pick up the trailer and took the time to show me how to operate everything in detail.

Tom went out of his way to help with final adjustments and connecting to the tow vehicle.  I was impressed and very satisfied with my decision to buy from them.  Highest recommendation to anyone in the used RV market.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I had a great experience at RV Max. I bought a 2010 Jayco hybrid for a good deal and the trailer was in great shape. The customer service was exceptional and they followed through on a promise to replace a mattress cover that had been damaged. I would highly recommend RV Max. Thanks!

The RVMAXX team was extremely helpful during the evaluation and buying cycle. They helped us determine the best option for our family. Very friendly  team...

As a follow up, I took my RV back to them a few months after for a few small minor issues that occurred, (mainly cosmetic). They took care of everything immediately on the spot and complimentary.</Text>

<UserId.>117354912940655355734</UserId.><text>My wife and I were shopping for a motorhome on line 3/2019. We found the exact motorhome that we were looking for at RVMAX. We were so pleased with the entire staff because they were professional and patient with all  of our questions. They assured us that the motorhome was as outstanding as it appeared on line. We traveled from Wisconsin to inspect and test drive the motorhome and the technician on site spent several hours with us going over every part of the motorhome and was clear that he didn't want us to have any issues in our travels.  The training session/inspection  was so informative that we taped it and are using it as a reminder of the features and safety. This company is true to their word and stands by their product. Thank You for everything Mike and the entire staff at RVMAX.< /text>< date>

We picked up our used prowler trailer today from RVMAX in Loomis.  We are so happy with it.....it is just exactly what we wanted. It looks new...everything has been gone over and explained to us. Everyone was very nice and helpful.And the best part is they were honest about everything....they even did some things that we didn't expect....like new curtains. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good honest deal.Thanks guys for the great service!< /Text>

Was an incredibly easy experience with a knowledgeable and friendly family-owned business.  We were most impressed with the fact that they performed some significant repair work that we had not requested, just because they felt it was needed.  If you're looking for a pre-owned RV, don't pass up this place!</text>

Or sales team Mike and Dan are 'old school' gentlemen. Laid back and knowledgeable. Nothing like you would expect from a vehicle sales shop.
The team at RVMAX, from start to the final signature, created a workable plan to purchase our next Rv.
Before you go browsing on craigslist (for your next RV), think about your familie's safety. The detailed pre and post vehicle inspection list, provided by Mike and Dan will let you rest assured the right dealership, as we proudly choose to do.
Great service combined with friendly knowledgeable staff.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I recently purchased a travel trailer for my family of six.  After MUCH searching we settled on one from their lot.  The salesman was nice, helpful, and didn't pressure us.  I needed a quick turnaround for a family camping trip and Mike and crew were accommodating.  When I came to pick up the trailer everything was clean and ready to go.  The radio was not working, and due to the quick turnaround needed, they were not able to replace it.  Mike went above and beyond to ensue we were satisfied with our purchase and we in fact walked away happy.</Text>< gmapID>

I liked the prompt service and the knowledgeable sale people. All the trailers were clean and presentable. They didn't seem to pressure you into a purchase.</review>

< Review>
Shopped for months for "just the right one" cruising the web, list after list, and then I spotted one that I thought was it. We drove 87 miles one way to look at what I thought was the one, only to find that they had another trailer that was even better. Greeted by Jenna, we were told to look around all we wanted to, and ask if we had any questions. Never any pressure, and when we did ask, there was help that we needed. We wound up making three trips because of our own decision making, and picked up our trailer on the third. Drove over 500 miles round trip for a trailer? This was going to be trailer number 5 for us and we wanted the right one.Treated with respect & courtesy gave us the time to shop, and we were not disappointed.   I can't say enough about how well we were treated with the whole process down to the delivery walk around. We will be back, and send friends & family.<//Review>

About a month ago, I bought a travel trailer from these wonderful people at RVMax. From the second we walked in the door we were happily helped by staff and the owner even tho it was 10 minutes before closing! They helped us decided what RV would work best for us and were very informative. They were so accommodating in all areas even having our trailer ready for us a few days early. We are extremely pleased with our experience here. We recommend anyone who is looking to purchase an RV to take their business at RVMAX in Loomis...they won't be disappoint!

Thank you guys!!!!!</Review>

In my opinion there is no other SANE way to buy a used RV than to purchase from RVMAX!
In the state of Caifornia a used RV dealership must guarantee that everything is in working condition when you purchase it. RVMAX goes farther than that. If you find something wrong after the purchase let them know and they will take care of it. They want to have the best reputable used RV business in the area and they protect that reputation! They WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!
I was about to purchase from a private owner. When he moved the RV a huge gush of water began to leak out from the
underneath membrane all along the seam! Ask yourself "What guarantee do you have 2 miles down the road after purchasing from a private owner?" ANYTHING could be wrong and you now have to pay to fix it yourself! I got lucky and didn't purchase that RV. That owner told me he sold it 2 hours later to someone else! (Sorry if that was you.) After that experience, I went straight to RVMAX and made a purchase. Once the RV was at my location I noticed one of the walls was spongy and able to be pushed in. I called RVMAX and they came to my location and transported my RV over 20 miles back to their shop, rebuilt the wall and transported the RV back to my location all at their expense. They also apologized that they did not catch the wall's condition earlier. I have nothing but good things to say about the owner Mike, his daughter Jenna, his brother Gary, my salesman Walt, Susan in the office, Nathan the guy who rebuilt the wall, Ray at their Loomis location and even the transporter,Bud, who helped cut some trees that were in the way at my location! These people still have the old fashioned customer service, compassion, and integrity we all are looking for and is so scare these days. They all are definitely a breath of fresh mountain air as I picked out an RV by myself 3,000 miles from home. THANK YOU ALL, you did a TREMENDOUS job! I love my 5th wheel!....BG<//review>

<Text>Best RV dealer!!! loved the experience never felt pressured or hovered o er by sales men. The whole staff there is super friendly and most of all honest. They preped my travel trailer quickly so that I could get out and enjoy the nature. Hands down will never buy an RV from anywhere else.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Everyone at the business is very polite, courteous, thoughtful, knowledgable and professional.  They actually kept an eye out for a year for just the right camper for our light pickup truck and called us when they got one in.  The camper is in very good shape, very clean.  Tom and Nathan were very thorough going thru the camper and explaining everything to us.  Great customer service, guys!!  Highly recommend this place!<//Review>< userid>

< Review>
I bought a 36 ft 5th wheel from RVMax at the beginning of the year (2015). I thought the experience was going to be scarey due to all the money involved, however the staff made me feel comfortable with my purchase 100%. The staff held true to their word that they would take care of me and make the trailer and services meet my requirements. They even went ABOVE AND BEYOND when, Mike, the owner, came out to my property to correctly reposition my trailer when it could not be done by the transporter. THANK YOU, Mike! RVMAX met and exceeded my expectations!</Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>I recently purchased a toy hauler from RV Max and I'm very disappointed in the condition at time of pickup. I was told that the trailer would be fully inspected and ran for a 12 hour period to ensure that
all was operating properly and any repairs needed would be done before we came to get it. I was
upset that the window shades were broken and falling off and it made me wonder what else we will
find in disrepair. I was also told that the trailer would be thoroughly cleaned and I wouldn't recognize
it when I saw it. Not true the outside wasn't washed and the inside was filthy; old shelf lining, bread
crumbs and a lot of dirt in the shelves and the bathroom was filthy. Bottom line I'm very upset and
disappointed, I thought I was working with an honest and caring dealership but that is not the case
at all. I feel a little ripped off and I will never deal with RV Max again.<//review>< user_name>

The people here at RV Max are not just sales people. They don't try to push you into buying a the trailer that will make a better deal for them, but push them selfs to find the trailer that is the best deal for you. They truly care about their customers and want to get the best trailer and the best and lowest price for them. I came to them and had a tight budget and no credit so I was in a bind and need a 5th wheel for more than a camping or weekend fun trailer, And I never would have been able to get the 5th wheel I got for the great and more than affordable price I did  with out all of the great help and kindness from Mike williams, and Jenna Williams, Susan Laner, and my more than helpful sales associat Ty.</review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>My wife and I bought a used fifthwheel from Mike at RVMAX in Loomis, CA and could not be happier with the service.  I live out of state and flew in to look at the RV.  It's condition was just as described to me on the phone.   Mike answered all my questions in a straight forward professional manner.  I did not feel pressured by him and his service tech Nathan was top-notch.  When we left, Mike told me that while there was no warranty, if we had any problems develop on our initial trips, to let him know so he could work out a remedy.  I considered this above and beyond.  My last trailer the dealer would not even stand behind the items he promised to fix much less those he was unaware of.  Its a good feeling to leave a dealership feeling like you were not being taken advantage of.  I recommend Rvmax in Loomis  completely if you are looking for an exceptional RV dealer.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Currently living here this place has some strong points and strong cons. The property is split into a Apartment side and a Condo side. As far as the property it's nice kept clean and nice scenery. A down fall is a large lack of parking for people with more than one vehicle. Living on the Condo(HOA) side you only get one assigned parking. So for people who have more than one car  are going to struggle. There is a new parking  rules implemented  that is happening on the apartment side  that with out a permit you will have your car towed. They do have a tow company that comes regularly to take cars. ALSO get a clear map of the diveded property because there isn't any signs that show you  where the Condo and apartment side split.As of now when contacting the manager they have no ressolution for people in the Condo side and basically  tell you to figure it out for a parking ressolution for your other vehicles. So there clearly is a huge division and it  isn't being addressed in the best way. Other than this issue it would have been a great. Just a heads up.</text>

This place looks beautiful in the entrance but living here is horrible. Looks are deceiving, you might as well spend less at an uglier apartment complex because this place is roach infested anyway. Management is horrible, parking sucks, noisy ghetto neighborhood. Don’t waste your money!<//text>

Be careful signing your lease here and make sure you do a walk through before you do. They also charge a 100 holding deposit which they will tend to keep due to processing your application over the allotted time, takes weeks before they do any verifications to approve your application. Therefore you lose your deposit because you only get 72hrs to get a refund. The complex also only looks nice in the front, drive through the back. Tons of broken down cars , no wonder there's no parking and it should be a prime example on the management and maintenance procedures. Good luck!!<//text>

<review>I’ve lived at the Lido’s for almost 9 years. I love that they take great pride in keeping the grounds neat and well manicured.  The office staff is friendly and the manager, Jennifer, very caring and professional. I have always felt very safe here.  It’s a wonderful place to call home.< /review>< Pics>

I did my undergrad and Master's at CSUSB.  Lived in Lydo for three years in 2 different units; one of my apartments was robbed when I wasn't home, and a crazy dude tried to break-in at the other spot, and I had to chase him out. Horrible neighborhood, the management at the apartment was great, but no joke, pay a little extra to live somewhere safer. Also, the parking was horrible.<//Text>

I’ve only lived at the lidos for 4 months, I’ve never had an issue with bugs, I’ve never had an issue w/ theft. The water has never turned brown, but it was shut up for a couple of hours due to pipe issues (management will inform you about these things if you ask during lease signing as I did)  they do give you a letter saying clean off your porch if things are on it besides a gas bbq and patio furniture but they’ve never threatened to fine me for it (they say not to leave things on your porch, so that people don’t feel the need to steal.... Its a safety thing. I have had issues with the sink, due to the apartments being older, things are going to break, or need a little TLC because the complex is old (take that into consideration when moving in) the maintenance has a big complex to cover... while cleaning up after the mess people leave around so it will take them a bit to get to your needs (having patiences is key). My neighbors can be loud but that’s the risk you take moving into an apartment and not a house, you have to share the environment so my family don’t mind. It’s a cool and quiet place to live while we save up for a house(: hope this helps anyone looking to move in.< /Text>

A kid almost was robbed for his AirPods, and sketchy people walking around at night, screaming, fights, and honking horns, etc. !!!DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!

The best part about this community is the pools and the nice people that could possibly be met here.< /Review>

Horrible place to leave. Dont bother renting here, you will not be happy. They don't fix anything here. Had old closet doors fall apart on top of me while pregnant! Over a year later still no closet door, emailed coroprate and no one seems to do anything??? If i have problems i litterally have to walk the grounds looking for a maintenance worker to come in and fix my plumming issuse with the sink!! Water turns brown and tub feels up with nasty sewer water!! Roach and termite issuses. The staff walks around and your not allowed to have anyrhing on your porch but a chair or they treaten to fine you.heaven forbid you have kids with toys!! Maybe if they had invested in storage space it wouldnt be to much of an issues!! Would rate this place less than 5 stars but not an option!!! Do not.rent here!!!</Review>

Terrible place to live at. Same your time and money and go somewhere else cause this is not the place to live at. My apartment always had roaches and maintenance would come and “spray”, don’t know what they sprayed or if they did it at the right spot cause they always came back. My dryer was making a loud noise every time we dried clothes and it took them about 3 months to come fix it. Our bathroom tub was peeling and they never came to fix it. My last couple months I got a puppy and paid the pet deposit and never saw it again nor my apartment deposit. If you called the office they would hardly pick up. If I could give this place zero stars I would.< /Review>

There's no reason for anyone to move here, so this is more of a list of reasons why this is a fact.
Black mold that goes unchecked until you withhold rent. Bugs and roaches in the walls. Terrible parking with assigned spots that other residents don't abide by. The gate rarely works and when it does people just line up,so really it's just a nuisance instead of a security feature. There's a lot of crime in the complex. The laundry is horrible and dirty. Maintenance takes weeks to fill repair orders.</Review>

<review>We lived at Lido for about a year. The process of getting in to the apartment was great, easy and efficient. We formed a great relationship with the management, Cadence and Mariah, while they were there, and that made the experience very pleasant. We had some issues with the apartment, but they were dealt with during our lease and the apartment was always livable. The amenities were nice, and the main pools were kept clean year round. Jennifer, the current manager, helped us frequently and was consistent with correspondence, making repairs and other issues much easier to deal with. For San Bernardino, and the price range it is in, it is the best option available.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

If something is broke they claim a few days but will take weeks to even send someone over to acknowledge the problem. They never answer the phone at the front office. Have to call countless times and leave countless voicemails. Have had mold in the apartments 3 times. Spiders are all over the stairs of the apartments. They constantly try to raise the price for below average apartments. There are many other places around this area that will care about the tenants. Do not waste your time or money on this place.

<text>The management here is terrible. For one they don't know how to work with people. I lived here almost two years and have had more problems than not. I pay for washer and dryer in home and my dryer was broke for a little over a month and I got no compensation or anything after bringing it up several times. There is never anybody in the office on the condo side, ever. I have been calling as well and can't get connected that way either. There always seems to be some sort of 'emergency' that the water needs to be cut off for hours at a time, a couple times without notice. I also want to be clear that I am not the only one who feels as such. I have several neighbors who could give the same exact stories that they have had on their own. I would not recommend living here if you can do elsewhere just purely based off my experiences with management.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Place is f’n horrible . Don’t recommend it to anyone , from office people to maintenance, parking , manager won’t ever be there and if you have a problem she won’t ever reply , a yr later and she still has not replied to me ! When office ppl said well u can message her .. total bs , you have anything broken good luck getting them to fix it I had my fence blown away 2 yrs ago and 10 orders later and still ntn has property stolen and that’s not there problem but where’s my fence ? but b a min late on rent and u have a notice on ur door , water is shut off at least once a month with no notice so much more they care ntn about there tenants, you have mold inside your home and still they do nothing about it</text>

Have hated every minute of living here . Please please please look elsewhere unless your standards are extremely extremely low and your other option is living behind a dumpster . It pisses me off to have to pay them a cent every month . The apt is fugly .. the appliances are trash and from the fifties.. nobody fixes anything..they turn off the water for several hours at least 2 times , again AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK!!!!! FOR HOOOOOOUUURRRSS! Blaming pipe issues , whatever! The parking is HORRIBLE! If you're not home by 8 (EVERYDAY) good luck on finding a spot. RUN RUN RUN!

<time>1542463954388<//time><Review>DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! If I could leave no stars I definitely would. I was originally supposed to move into one unit. They had 1 month to clean and fix whatever. Upon the weekend of my move I was told the unit still wasnt ready I was asked to switch units at the last minute. *Should have seen the first red flag* Within 2 weeks of the Unit I moved into I noticed an absurd amount of roaches, notified the office and they sent out pest control that didnt help so I had to do my own pest control. Within 3 days my hot water heater needed to be replaced. Within 2 months, my kitchen drain broke and it flooded underneath my sink. The washer had rust rings around the lid, it was obviously not cleaned. New neighbors moved in upstairs from my unit and discovered the last tenants left laundry in the dryer. The sink in the master bathroom kept filling up with water and took about an hour to completely drain. The maintenance men do patch jobs then it's back to square one. I had to deal with these issues for the whole year I lived there. They're quick to take your money but not quick to fix anything. Oh, and when I got my keys I was told if they had to fix things repeatedly in the apartment I would have to pay for it, which is BS because these were all obvious issues before I even moved in. I walked into the office in July of this year and saw a woman with anger on her face she walked up to the girl on the office pissed because she said she'd just moved in 3 days prior and she had roaches, Idk what unit she came from. They send out letters regularly regarding bedbugs. They regularly shut the water off for hours without notice. These apartments are trash please DO NOT MOVE HERE! Think of yourself and if you have children PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE think of them. They are sheisty as hell and charge $1500 for rent because of the location not the quality of their units.</Review><user_name>Domonique<//user_name><userid>110766838223168733413</userid>< gmapID>

<Text>Great staff, fast and friendly maintenance, cool hill to climb behind the apartments, next to the university, walking distance from Baker's, Stater Brothers and Rite Aid, and very clean and well kept grounds. The only truly negative thing is that the apartments are in San Bernardino and some crime bleeds from the bad areas nearby. Our family no longer live in apartments but if we did then we would certainly consider living at Lido again.<//Text>< Pics>

This place is so annoying. We put in our 30 day notice and they never told us the amount we would owe for the pro rated amount of 10 days into the month. So we assumed we would pay it on the day we turn in the keys. We got a notice before our move out date even was up saying we owe all full amount of rent plus late fees. And we also requeated for 3 months for our floor to be fixed and our carpet  was tearing with the carpet tacks sticking out and they never came to fix it. They never answer there phones either. We call and call and call and leave messages and never hear anything back. So glad to be leaving.<//text>

Do not move here this is the worst place ever all the money that you are spending and things are still not getting fixed. I just moved out and before I did they had all the pools closed saying it's a maintenance thing. There is a VERY BAD ROACHES PROBLEM and when they do spray stuff doesn't work it makes it worse. Finally the new manager Jennifer she thinks she is the finest thing ever with her rude attitude she needs to fix it before somebody fixes her. So final warning do not move into these apartments unless you just need it to be close to the University then go ahead but you still shouldn't. Also I read on facebook I love San Bernardino page and it said it's crazy how they find a dead body in the pool bathroom and they don't even put a letter on the door they just let people back in the pool like it wasn't nothing so yea please don't stay here.< /Text>

<Text>Bathrooms to the gym are always dirty and disgusting. They rarely seem to have any maintenance available to clean up the mess around the property. Trashed are thrown outside of the dumpsters sometimes. People have had break ins on their vehicles many times when they should have more surveillance cameras on site. There are mice, possums, the ceiling was falling apart in one of the apartments, the rent is very expensive for a place that can’t even take simple care of their tenant’s needs. I’m glad I never rented an apartment there after knowing somebody personally who has lived on the property.< /Text>< pics>

<review>WARNING DON'T NOT MOVE HERE! READ ALL THE COMMETS ONCE YOU MOVE HERE YOU WOULD BE LEAVING MANY comments  AS WELL....
I can't stress the issue how this place is so bad! It may look cute but it's only the front interence. The first week I moved here ONE OLDER  MAN DIED BY GETTING STAB GOING TO HIS CAR! This was 2016 going into 2017 If you don't believe me call the station and ask.
They never ever fix ANYTHING! They do what ever to keep your money! And I can't tell you HOW MANY TIMES THEY TURN OFF YOUR WATER BECAUSE OF PLUMING ISSUES. ALL THE STAFF ARE RUDE . But nice as hell when you are first moving in.
Only the office pool works nothing else ...they NEVER CLEAN THE GYM.
And DID I MENTION  ALOT OF FIGHTS AND RUDE PEOPLE MOVE HERE THEY DON'T CARE WHAT RECORD YOU HAVE THEY JUST WANT YOUr MONEY.
MOVE HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.. BUT I PROMISE YOU ONCE YOU LEAVE THIS PLACE you'll be right under me LEAVING THE SAME COMMENTS!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Text>Two of my cars got broken into. They had time to steal my whold speaker system with out anyone hearing about it. There was change all over the floor, VERY low security. After it being reported, management said they would do something but nothing happened. Don't live here if you own a Honda. Don't live here if you are a student trying to get by. Prices are not worth living here. When you first pull into these apartments it looks like the hilton, as soon as you get to the back it looks like a motel 6 with sofas and junk all over the back. The jacuzzi doesnt work , its always warm and not clear to step in. These apartments are easy to break into so if you have valuebles try to hide them upon moving in because if anyone sees what you have they will break in.</Text>< pictures>

This place has been a headache the whole 7-8 months I've been here. Repairs take forever. The management is sluggish and unprofessional when dealing with complaints. I've been dealing with extremely loud and disruptive upstairs neighbors for 2 months and am barely starting to get somewhere. At one point I was told that I was harassing them!</text>

WORST WORST WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!

The “Women” there have the worst attitude and dont help AT ALL. I spend over $3000 weekly. And such a good customer there! But ive had it. This is the reason on my review!! The store its self I love. Amazing prices!

But the people there im sorry NO TYPE OF HELP. Always RUDE!

You call them to see if they have an item in stock OVER 30 Minutes on hold.
Including Managers. One of them never wears a mask, and you will always hear her complain and talk about the people! And also speaks  to employees horrible.
They really need to hire new and get rid of the staff.< /Review>

No words.

Instead of placing the correct price boards at the items. They wants to blame on customers for the discounted price.

Tried to over charge for the items purchased. The management tried to talk us to pay extra price even though the items we purchased are in the discounted department.< /Text>< Pics>

Worst customer experience I’ve had ever....
The lady denied the fitting room service saying the store closes at 7PM even though it says 8PM on google.

I would rather give a negative rating to the store management if possible.< /Text>

I went to buy some cute shorts and had horrible customer service. Besides the fact that she removed her mask multiple times and wasn’t keeping her distance she refused to check a size on shoes i wanted and as i was checking out she kept insulting me and my outfit. Keep in mind i’m 17 years old and she was a lot older.Horrible experience</Review>

The manager who is in charge seems that she does not want to sell and she did not let me try on my clothes because she did not want to, because the changing rooms are open, it was not a blouse or two.  They have already touched me several times and it is super rude.< /text>

<review>Great selection and got exactly what we wanted. Wife's had a wallet from Guess for almost 9 years and it's still holding strong, but we figured it was time for a new one. Their selection was wide enough to accommodate many preferences, and we found a replacement for her at a great price.< /review>< Pictures>

Delicious food friendly service coffe served as many times you want, reasonable prices a little small place but ok for small groups on top of that very fast service compare to others that take forever to serve. Se los recomiendo a todos los chapines.< /review>

Don’t come here ! Food tastes old and obv not fresh. Some price you can go to other places nearby like Guatemalteca or Victoria in Inglewood .  Lady running everything is always rude like if she’s giving away food . Can’t run a business and we have always gave this place business until they started messing our orders and blaming us for they countless mistakes.  Food is NOT fresh .</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The food is excellent because it is my country's food, everything is fine but what I would like them to serve a little more because the truth I came hungry serve very little and the tortillas are very small, it is the only detail because I felt they charged me a lot for a little bit, it's the only detail thank you,

<Text>(Translated by Google) Too bad the food is no longer good, the chipilin tamales are only a small ball the same as the chuchitos and expensive and the lady who charges does not like that you ask for more because she is totally angry with bad taste ...

Got one item i was rather disspleased with how the size fit. Used the return shipping in the same box it came in and had the charge back to my card promply after sending it back.<//text><userid>114909018716346731725<//userid>< Pics>

<Text>This nacho Bell was our last option for today. When we walked in it smelled like rotten food. But I wasn’t surprised because it’s a Taco Bell. The food standard qualities are the same standard qualities as all the other Taco Bell’s. The only positive thing I can say is that it’s hot. The lady was very nice although I do not understand half the things that she said. I will only come here as a last resort. They should definitely hire other people to clean this Taco Bell because of that smell. We ordered the nacho Bell grande a cheese burrito and two tacos. The meet was made out of some kind of meat and the rest of the taco was made out of some other kind of taco stuff. All I can say is that it’s hot that’s it</Text><Date>1535505603853</Date>< UserId.>

I've used this drive through a few times recently, always get through the line quickly and they remember your fire sauce. The chain has simplified their menu but other than prices creeping up most people know what they're getting with TB.<//Review>

Ok, it's taco bell but finally I came home with my food with no sour cream.  I don't go to fast food much but when I do I wasn't thinking of Taco Bell cause they would always screw up my order.  Tonight they get a five star!< /review>

<Text>One of my usual places to eat near my house. Pretty speedy most of the time, but note that the inside closes at 10pm and the drive through backs up pretty quick. The bathroom cleanliness leaves something to be desired (use the one that's hidden from view until you get to the end of the hall as it gets less traffic)<//Text><user>107816002026680119777<//user></record>

Well what could I possibly say that has not been said before?  Despite the bad reviews, we came here after a night of drinking and we regretted a couple of hours later for reasons you already might imagine (lol).

Also, we were missing items from our order...Should you decide to come to this establishment - check your bags to make sure you have everything you ordered prior to leaving.<//review>

Horrible service I would give it a zero if I could I come here all the time and I order spicy Doritos tacos and they always let me and now today I go to the drive thru first they make me wait 15 minutes and then they take the order and after that she got it wrong and so we told her to replace it and she did by taking something off the menu instead of exchanging it and then we told her again and she stormed off which is really rude considering it was her fault and not ours. And on top of that this other lady came out and started yelling at us saying we made her friend cry or something and I was so confused like I’m srry she took our order wrong :| horrible service< /Review>

Manager and staff were rude and all they did was stare and not let their eyes off of us. My burrito had no meat and I asked for the cinnamon delights and they gave me cinnamon twists which they didn't even ask if I wanted. Dont go waste of money and waste of time.</review>

I normally don't give 1 star ratings to businesses but this one, I just had to. There food is okay, same kind of food every other Taco Bell sells so I am okay with that but what makes this Taco Bell get 1-star from me is their customer service. I have been there so many times, I actually started going there every other day on my way back from home.but everytime, literally every single time despite asking for sauce 2 times, they just don't put it in my bag. I get it they forget it sometimes but literally, everytime. If I let them know that they forgot to put sauce in my bag last think they treat me like as if I am asking for discount, no I am not. I am just letting you know.<//review>

PROS: I love, love this Taco Bell. Besides the fact that I really do enjoy Taco Bell food, I especially like the people working here; Thomas comes to mind. He is a wonderful person, greets you the moment you enter, knows you by name, and is quite personable. The restaurant is clean, the outside is well kept, no trash, landscaping is nice, and parking lot has ample parking. Just don't bring your RV or big trucks here!

THE ONE & ONLY CON: Not a drive-thru. :-((

Other than that, I will frequent this Taco Bell often!</text>

Terrible service at this location, orders often get misheard, mistaken, or flat out ignored. Management is terrible, too. There are plenty of other Taco Bell locations around the area, so by all means-please just save your time and skip this one.</Review>

< Review>
The day manager is awesome and extremely helpful and fair. Food never seems to be wrong. That's a real treat with fast food these days. The managers really on it. However the night manager as of August 15th is the slowest rudest person I've ever seen in fast food. Are ordered my meal here at Taco Bell and it took 20 minutes for them to make it and give it to me. I confronted the manager about it and all she did was stare at me. One of the other people who work for the woods in the manager stepped in and said I'm sorry about that. Taco Bell get this place under control</Review>

<review>Food is just as good as other taco bells. But one time in the morning, they decided to pour water/soap all over the floor to mop and told us to use the drive through. Service at the drive-through was questionable at best. No utensils with my skillet bowl and they gave us the wrong type of sauce that we asked for.</review><gmapID>0x808f95e913b7da23:0x91f1d053a8d6c85e< /gmapID></record>

I've been to this place countless times because it's so close to my house and they always mess up my order.

My most recent experience was horrible. They didn't wrap my burritos properly and it leaked all over the seat. I spent hours cleaning my car the next day.

Only advice I can give is triple check your order before you leave. They frequently forget to pack something.

I try drive to a different location whenever I am in the mood for some Taco Bell.< /Review>

This is the place to go if you have plenty of time. Slower than regular Mexican restaurants and the food is what you eat when you're out of choices. The prices is not far from Chevy's which have table service.<//Review>

I love working here and listening and reading reviews. It really helps to improve the store and to hear about customers who were unsatisfied and help change mistakes we have made. I love wings from here.</Text>

<review>I’m sorry but these have to be the worst chicken wings I have ever had . And I have been around over 70 years. The wings were dry and had no flavor whatsoever. Cooked yesterday and sold the following day flavor type of taste. To make matters worse very pricey for what you get.<//review>< Pics>

The girl Christine (shift leader) really cares about getting your order right.  She makes her employees do what it takes to make sure we are happy. Shout out to her and her team. Great job making delicious wings. Keep up the good work.</text>

Ordered the Loaded Fries Louisiana Style very delicious and fresh. I think the Customer Service Could use a boost maybe a little bit more friendly and welcome Customers as they come in, maybe not look so overwhelmed or sick of seeing peoples faces is what it seems like. Cashiers could use a boost of morale from leader so they would have fun at work looks like they have potential to be nice just need a person to show them how to. Other then that place seemed nice and tidy.</Review>

Staff were very rude. They refused to let a disabled lady sit in a chair while waiting for her order. I stated that they were not being compliant with ADA rules and regs. They just did not care.   As for me I will never go to a wing stop again.<//Review>

<Review>PSA NEVER GO TO WINGSTOP
I always order seasoned fries, same order today and I found a pubic hair in my fries. When I went to go talk to the manager I decided to warn other consumers to check their fries. While I was talking to them the manager tells the other customer "these things happen". I have never blown up on an employee before, but this is unacceptable no customer should have to worry about what the may find in their food.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Although there have been many complaints about the service and quality, WingStop tries their hardest in everything they do.
Remember, they are human too, mistakes are bound to happen. Give them a little credit for at least putting up grouches.< /text>

<review>I can’t speak highly enough of this practice !! The staff in reception were warm and welcoming and diligent. The dental nurse was kind and well informed and a safe practitioner. The dentist was amazing!! I was treated with respect and actively listened to . The expertise was clear to me and the examination was thorough and painless!!! If I could give 10 stars I would .<//review>< UserId.>

< Review>
This is THE best dental office I’ve been to in a long time! I left my previous dentist because I suspected they were just trying to get money out of me and it turns out, they were! At Bright Now, the dentist was straight up with me and it turns out I didn’t need any of the stuff the other dentist was trying to get out of me! I love this place. Also the hygienist is amazing and so sweet. I have extremely sensitive teeth and she made sure that my pain was VERY MINIMAL. I can’t recommend this place enough!</Review>

This dental office is a scam. They don't perform the proper exam, or cleaning. I had tooth sensitivity on one side and all they advised was to "change toothpaste" and to take Ibuprofen every time I am in pain. Turns out after switching Dentists, I am in need of a root canal.
Don't risk it. I would NOT recommend their services to any one. Period.
PATTY THE FRONT DESK LADY IS  THE RUDEST ONE.... DEBRA BYERS THE general dentist is unknowledgeable, unresponsive, impolite and uncaring.</text>

<text>I have been to Bright Now Dental two times now.  The first time was to repair and replace a bridge. This was a delicate procedure which they handled very well. It has performed well. That was in 2018.

Two days ago I was in a great deal of pain From a molar that I had with hairline fracture. I went to their office, they got me in the next day which was yesterday. Once again my experience was excellent. Very professional and sensitive to my condition. It ended up I needed to have the tooth removed😩 it was a painless yet lengthy process and well done.

Under these challenging times I couldn’t be more satisfied with my experience. Well done Bright Now!

Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Because of his expertise the dentist  provided me with very useful information about how I can improve the overall heath and extend the life of my teeth. Also they have programs that help make dental care more affordable if you don’t have dental insurance.< /text>

I’m shocked that this place is open for business. People, don’t fall into the same trap we did by ignoring reviews. This place is very unprofessional and yes, it needs a little remodeling.
I’m too upset with their service to write anything so visit this place at your own risk.
The receptionist is very amateur and the doctor seemed like he was hung over.
5 hours later and they haven’t been able to review my insurance to see my 8 year old daughter who has a bad tooth pain.
They can charge me for the x ray when they get their finance straight but I’m will not be going back here.
BRIGHT SMILE!!! Fix your service!!</review>

Phil behind the desk is distinctly over and above what is required for the job, which left me with the impression that if he can help you, beyond what you are aware of, he will.  That is rare.    And Kim is like no other.  If you want knowledge about every detail about what's going on with your teeth, you'll be so impressed with what she shares.  You'll be left feeling like they have your entire mouth being monitored day and night, and under control.  Fast, no waiting,  warm.  Thank you for giving it 110%.< /Review>

I really feel good in this office. Everyone is very friendly, knowledgeable, and  I feel well taken care of.  I moved up from Fairfax (Marin County) a couple years ago.  Bright Now was the dental office someone recommended, and boy am I grateful to have found such an excellent one.  Dr. Machado is wonderful.  He goes the extra mile to do the best job possible.  Thank you, Bright Now!< /text>

<review>After getting the wrong color on my emergency filling and complaining because "beggars can't be choosers", I got a call from the office giving me an appointment for yesterday, the appointment time was changed via emails 2 times. I need to get pre medicated with antibiotics 1 hour prior to a dental procedure, so thinking the dentist was going to change the filling to a matching color, and because the last time I my gum was bleeding, I took the antibiotic. (I have pictures).
So... the assistant who was insulting me and complaining the last time, takes me to the room, places a bib around my neck, I don't get any excuses from her, and then the dentist comes and states: I heard that you wanted to talk with me, and I tell him that I want my filling to be replaced by one matching  my front tooth color, then he tells me that it is a "temporary filling" and he is not going to replace it because I am supposed to get a crown. Then I tell him that I will go to have the crown with a dentist who treats me the right way.
I feel cheated, because the broken filling repaired was one he installed previously, and I cannot afford a crown right now. So knowing that the "temporary filling" may break and fall soon, I will be looking for another dentist.
I am not happy with Bright Now! Dental, I feel humiliated and cheated, and I will not go back. I was not ready to be lied about the reason for using a wrong color, because it is "temporary", so I will be forced to have a crown, and specially because it was an emergency (the dentist HAS the obligation to attend me according to the contract, and it doesn't mean to patch an upper front tooth with the wrong matching color because "beggars can't be choosers" using a left over color, or even worst to make it new and wrong. It is a complete lack of professionalism, and an insult to the patients with an urgent emergency.</review>< resp>

<review>If I could give 10 stars I would! The dentist and staff at this office are all amazing! I have had the best experience here start to finish. Everyone is so friendly and goes out of the way to make you feel comfortable and informed. Going to the dentist especially in pain can be very unpleasant but they make it so much better!

<Review>Had a great experience in this office, everyone is very friendly and helpful, both front and back staff including providers. I couldn't be happier with this office, I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a dentist or is thinking of changing providers to try this office out. You won't be disappointed.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Appointment for dental hygiene. Waited over 50 minutes. I asked if there was a problem, they got me in to see another hygienist that was open . I think they forgot about me. I was told they double booked. They did not tell me there would be a delay. The 2nd hygienist, Kim, was very apologetic, professional and educational. She is the reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 2.<//review>

<Review>Kim cleaned my teeth and was super gentle and thorough. She communicated well with me so I was full aware of what to expect. She was fantastic!!! My usual dentist, Dr. Amador wasnt there, which is really disappointing.  I really felt comfortable with him and he always did a great job. I hope he returns.</Review>< GmapID>

<rate>1</rate><text>Their service deteriorated. They used to be absolutely amazing but after the latest experience I am looking for a new dentist office. Even though I arrived 20 minutes before my scheduled appointment I had to wait 40 minutes to be seen. Even though i scheduled a tooth repair and extraction all i got after wasting almost an hour was an exam and a " please schedule another visit for the extraction". This has never happened before. When I asked about it at the front I got a quote for the extraction that was triple as before (with the same insurance same procedure). I asked about it and got a quiet no answer. Anyway, please be aware when you go in. Things have changed but not for the better but rather for worse. Very dissapointing and sanding.</text>< pictures>

Even though bright now dental is a chain, the way they value, and care for their patients is amazing. From giving me a reminder call 10 min before my appointment, to giving me a follow up appointment to my best convinience. I always look forward to my appointments due to the warm welcoming from the front desk,  all the way to the great care that I receive from Dr. Amador. Thank you bright now dental!< /Text>

Went to this this dentist knowing I had work that needed to be done. The dentist had no manners and didn’t even hardly speak to me. The office staff was no better! I felt like I was being judged as a stupid person for allowing my teeth to get bad. When we finally reviewed the work to be done, I was given NO options. Every tooth that needed work, HAD to be filled with the more expensive resin instead metal because “no dentist uses metal any more for fillings”. Got my dental insurance to switch me to another dentist. Now I am getting my work done for a third of the price, the staff is wonderful, and no one in the new office makes me feel like they are judging me for the condition of my teeth.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1530294521916, 'text': "Hi Tarah,\n\nI'm so sorry that your experience with us wasn't a positive one.

<Text>Worst cleaning of my life. The tech yanked my head off of the chair countless times, and even dropped tools and didn’t immediately sanitize until I said something. While the staff is nice, they displayed a fair level of incompetence by making both insurance and multiple scheduling errors.

I was kept waiting for 2 hours before I was brought into xray then waited some more before seeing the dentist, after letting one of staff know that I had been waiting too long. No one came to update about the delay and for how long. Meanwhile, I could only hear the staff, including the dentist chatted away cheerfully as if it’s business as usual. I waited because I was desperate for a cleaning. The cleaning was average, the equipment seemed outdated, i.e, the overhead light for shining into your while your teeth were getting cleaned was the dimmest and the smallest I have ever seen. The bathrooms too were in need of renovation, things were falling apart snd outdated. It could be just thid location in Rohnert Park, CA. I don’t know, but I left without making the next appointment.< /text>

Worst experience of my life with a dental office, made me wait in lobby for 1hr to then tell me that they could not treat my tooth.
All I wanted was to fix my broken front tooth.
Never again will i step foot in this office. It's a waist of time and they didn't listing to anything i said.</text>

A Very upsetting visit for me yesterday,I really needed help for my aching tooth. They just took an Xray and wanted me to come another day.Now I have to look outside for help, which I will pay much more, although I had just paid the Yearly Dental Plan.Not good for me coz I have to go through this pain for a couple more nights before I get help.🤔😡😇!!< /text>

As DJ Rockalot I recently performed for a wedding here. The backdrop for the ceremony is beautiful and interior of the country club is elegant. I definitely recommend Discovery Bay Country Club for your next event!<//Text>

< review>
Course is primarily flat but plenty of holes with water and bunkers to make it challenging.  Nice views and  staff. Breakfast at the clubhouse is really good.  The snack bar makes great sandwiches too!</review>

Beautiful facilities, beautiful golf course... Have been to a few weddings here and they have been amazing! Go down to the golf shop... It's really nice and the man behind the counter isn't too bad on the eyes either and he's very friendly and informative and always good for a laugh... Ok he's my Dad but still you won't be disappointed!!< /Review>

Such a beautiful well groomed golf course! The members of this club are some of the sweetest people you will have ever had the pleasure to meet. There is a great snackbar downstairs that you can grab a bite to eat and get good cocktails too! Plenty of parking is available if you book an event with the club... One of the best clubs around!<//Text>

<text>They accept reservations for indoor and outdoor seating. Their outdoor, rooftop patio is gorgeous and equipped with heaters. The customer service is excellent, along with the atmosphere. The food was savory and well-seasoned. One of our friends is a bread-a-holic and rated their bread one of the best he's ever had. Even the clam chowder was delicious! This is a must go. It's a little on the pricey side, but 100% worth it. Try the Salmon and lasagna. Enjoy!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUWNispcD-NkCriTNeC7SzkY5fZnlqPV3nhHid=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFgKa-8CIvqXOT6orxujIBDvc7uTOsfEuqXejS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHtabaadxTm-eXA2ikVTuRh2WpTYP0Xk-RKst=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<text>Very cute little restaurant in the heart of Carmel. Outdoor seating feels like you’re in a treehouse with the elevated balcony. We were told to wait 20 minutes for a table but were seated almost immediately. Nice bathroom!

COVID wise: servers wore their masks but didn’t enforce guests at all. Tables were very close together with little to no distancing.

Menu was only 2 pages long but had a variety of cuisines such as burgers, thai curry, pastas, and spanish paella.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8aadGSfms6uH_RzRzmNDstSWg_gQsjbn8_5tz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa9QEZHAnbSvd8jqzQV7BO59pnrRA7YBBTVOp9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhVAq3RZAb_b6Ky4kuXoutiRwR8BgW-ofagolI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCkz6JKNiIGiZZK_gwfYkPK1NUr2DGhLObILJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBtcYAHSvsKy5PkvHucs_KBTMzYYzvkWeeUgFa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPHgcuQ26VJhXxrLF71F3TrrIueAbHw1iT6hln=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Cute outdoor patio setup. Staff all really friendly. However, I got the paella, and even there was ample shrimp, some mussels, sausage slices, chicken, salmon and a bit of bell peppers, the ratio to rice was off. And it was $36…<//review>

<user>115809759459665988464<//user><review>The lentil soup, greek salad, and sea bass were excellent. Tasty. However the manager, or whoever he was, was SUPER nice. He helped us get our stroller up the stairs, and was very accommodating to our family. He stopped by our table to ask how the food was even though he was not our waiter. He was kind, happy, polite, professional, and extremely hospitable. We will go back just because this guy was great. Great service and great food.

The ambiance, outdoor seating, heaters, and lights were great. All around a 5-star place to dine.</review>< name>

<text>Nice little place, perfect for a quiet fancy night. My group was fully vegetarian and we had to scrape the menu for veg food. The mushroom ravioli was delicious - a must try. We also had pasta and red thai curry, which were both just okay. The garlic bread was a pleasant surprise and I'd totally recommend it.<//text>< Pics>

Amazing outdoor dining.  The Seafood Paella was a very large portion - perhaps meant for sharing.  The shrimp were giant!  Baklava was delicious and DH says they have the best Clam Chowder.  We came on a Friday late afternoon around 4pm and we were seated right away.  All employees were smiling under their masks (I could see it in their eyes)  It was perfect!< /Review>

Excellent restaurant, unfortunately only takeout at present. Our take out dinner a couple of nights ago was very good. Probably the best lamb I have eaten in a very long time. The owner ws very pleasant and helpful. It's slightly on the pricier side, but typical of Carmel pricing, however the food was absolutely worth it. We will order again from them before we leave Carmel in a few days.

4/10/21 update.

Had the opportunity to visit this restaurant again, but this time for indoor dining.

My review thoughts have not changed. This is a very very good restaurant. The menu is quite eclectic, from Thai curry to steak to kebabs. I once again had the lamb kebabs, and once again they were outstanding.

The wait staff service was also very good.

Should be very high on any Carmel visitors restaurant dining list</Review>

It was a great rec - small family-owned restaurant with a wide variety of food options. The family is consistently checking in on guests.

I got the lamb stroganoff and my partner got the shrimp pasta. Both were good, but would probably try something new off the menu next time! The sommelier highly recommended their curries. One of the best parts was oil mixture they served with bread and no corkage fee if you bring Scheid wine!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ-zP97xYAYP_yp4HD_tJ9UQjwnZ2AKv3SHSXZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMegAZWs3Uhl4phS-lpvHrwbvbeAOt_WUkKd6n-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

We ordered grilled sea bass and grilled salmon. Both served piping hot. Both very good. We also ordered a Greek salad which was good. We had mango raspberry cheese cake and baklava for dessert. Both were good. Overall, great service, great food but very expensive. But I guess, in Carmel, that may be expected.<//Review>

I’m not going out on a limb by recommending the Tree House Cafe in Carmel. The staff are nice, friendly and very attentive. The food delicious, heavily portioned with nice pricing.
Ambiance, inside or out is perfect. Try it.<//Review>

<Review>Two things are vital to the  experience of eating: the effort with with which your food is prepared  and the love with with which your food is served.
The treehouse team has mastered this art.
Thank you for providing us with memories which our family will cherish for a long time.< /Review>< UserId.>

Great location. Beautiful trees and the front garden is great. Came in only for a glasses wine on a Saturday night at 7:00. Obviously very busy. Friendly service and a good wine by the glass selection. Loved this place, will definitely be back.< /text>

<Review>Last week was the first time we visited this magnificent restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the finest  dishes and fine drinks and with the comfortable price. We will definitely return there again.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Perfect cozy atmosphere, off the main streets of carmel-by-the-sea. Their pasta is made fresh from a lil pasta spot right next door. The Spanish Paella was delicious! Finger-licking good. Perfectly paired with the dreaming tree wine. Also, we were lucky to be given free dessert. (Thank you, treehouse!) The baklava was beautiful! Loved our girls trip here. We'll definitely be coming back!</text>< pics>

Personal Touch ⭐⭐

Restaurants are like love affairs. It doesn't have to be perfect, but some things will make it last.

We came from a far to visit this restaurant. We waited about 40 minutes for a table. Met Fadi, the Jordanian entrepreneur who owns the restaurant. Very pleasant.

The food was absolutely delicious. The sauces were just perfectly done, not overly creamy, just the right consistency. The food combinations were awesome.

The server didn't recommend any appetizers. Went from drinks to main course. When asked about the Ravioli special vs. the seafood pasta, he said he liked both but couldn't recommend one over the other. So I ordered both. Though the owner knew we came from a far and it was to celebrate a birthday, there was no effort to make the birthday girl's evening special.

The server only visited the table just once since the order. The owner didn't visit any tables while we were there.

We would have ordered dessert and wine had the service was better. This is where the relationship part come in. We would have gladly spent a lot more money, but went elsewhere for dessert and wine.

There was a table of 4 next to us who just had water, no dessert, but was googling where to go from there. Missed opportunity.

There are many great restaurants in Carmel. We come to Carmel often. We come for that special Carmel experience and service. I hope Fadi realizes that it's a privilege to have customers, not a privilege to eat at his restaurant. Make the customers feel amazing and they will return even if the food missed a beat that day or on that dish.

Great potential at this location and at this restaurant. Keep the kitchen staff, but change the attitude, spend more time taking care of your customers. Get to know them. They will come back. They will spend more money per check. They will be more forgiving.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>We celebrated my birthday here. Daniel - our server has given us 5 stars service. He made us feel so welcomed. Excellent Mediterranean food, Greek salad was freshly made with care. The grilled calamari was so delicate( although I wished they actually would grilled it instead of battered it). Very delicious though.
The chicken kabobs was tender, juicy and very flavorful( I’m very picky when it comes to chicken kabobs). Treehouse Cafe got this down.I would come back again on my next trip.< /Review>< pics>

Lovely little roof top oasis. My only complaint is that some seats are directly in the sun and everything is crammed in a little tight on the balcony, but I'd absolutely go back - with sunscreen.< /Text>

It was super yummy!! Had gyros for appetizer, seafood pasta and lamb kabobs - and baklava for dessert! Also had a glass of Sangria and I usually don’t enjoy red sangria but it was the best I’ve had!
They had us eat on patio upstairs which was beautiful! Would definitely recommend!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The deck seating was just right for today with a warm sun and cool air. The fresh pesto was balanced and tasty, the stroganoff a great comfort-food choice. Be ready to walk off the meal afterwards!< /text>

The Treehouse Cafe has exceptional chowder and the Thai sausage is delicious, too. We scored a bottle of fantastic red wine as well for a great discount. Service was great.</Review>

Just as important as food was the ambience. You fill like you are sitting on a little rooftop in Europe. The service was friendly, quaint, and intimate.

Will definitely be back!</Review>< pics>

Good Greek style salad. Pesto Chicken sandwich was just ok. It was pretty dry. Not much pesto and big dry pieces of chicken breast. You will need a lot of water to get it down.< /review>

<Text>Great food. They are working under their social distancing rules, and obviously trying hard. All the servers and bussers wear masks.

I recommend making a reservation earlier as they are very popular in weekends.

The Calamari is really good. It's not your classic small rings. In stead it is a slab of high quality squid that is breaded and cooked. My wife doesn't like calamari, and she loved this. It was not chewy at all.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>3<//rate><Text>Absolutely loved the location and charm of this place - very cool patio and indoor area also. Did not love the food, unfortunately. Our dishes were very bland with flavor, although they were well-presented and filling.
Staff was completely lovely, but our server seemed a little disappointed that I ordered a soda instead of wine.
Bear in mind I’m a simple man of simple tastes, so upscale places aren’t my forte, but hopefully this review can help another in my situation.
Overall, I’d 100% recommend this place to a trendy, spendy friend looking for a new experience because it’s really neat. But I would not go back myself because I prefer taste and value to atmosphere.< /Text>< userid>

Loved their wine (heavy pours) and had a great appetizer and bread! But unfortunately when my friend went inside to go to the bathroom she overheard one of the managers talking about very controversial political opinions! While we had different political stances, I'm okay with it but try not to talk about it in front of paying customers. Especially when she was saying some offensive stuff :(<//text>

<review>Loved the ambiance. Cute and intimate seating indoors as well as outdoors. The staff was very attentive. Their Mediterranean with Italian options went very well. The flavors were authentic to their respective cuisines. They have a good collection of alcoholic beverages including non alcoholics beers as well.< /review>< pics>

Great Gyros. I've spent 35 years going to Greece on holiday. This ranks with the best gyros I've had taste wise. Excellent environment for lunch and great service.</text>

A very wide variety of foods and all of them were excellent. Had the calamari steak, gyros, and a seafood pasta. Also tasted great with Riesling wine. Excellent service. Dog friendly on outside patio.</Review>

Wow. Green Thai curry was 10/10. So was the eggplant sandwich. The service was polite and fast. Only disappointment is that we have been coming to Carmel for years and only now are discovering this place!</review>

My husband and I have been here twice. Last time I had the smoked salmon sandwich- it was everything you would want out of a salmon sandwich. We also had the dolma appetizer, which was pretty up there with some of my favorite dolma. This time we had the goat cheese and honey with crostini and my husband had the chicken pesto sandwich and I had mussels as an entree (I scarfed them down before I remembered to take a pic. Whoops!) also the patio is the best seating in Carmel. It does fill up very quickly, because it’s a pretty small place!< /review>

<review>Amazing ambiance, intimate setting with a great vibe.  Food was fresh, good portions, nice presentation, from the time we ordered until our food arrived was unbelievably fast, food was tasty.  Server was attentive and checked in frequently, support staff picked up empty plates without asking or getting in the way.  Overall a highly enjoyable experience, highly recommend.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Stopped by on a whim as we were headed back up the coast to the Bay Area. Beautiful patio and amazing food! We got the salmon salad and the chicken kebabs + the mango cheesecake —everything was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend!</Review>

Fab cute little restaurant minutes away from the beach at Caramel. Cozy outside sitting with heating lamps at twilight adds a lot of romance and warmth, no matter the occasion ( not to mention a dog friendly place). The menu is more than satisfying with a rich assortment of Italian, Thai and Mediterranean options. I am going again (worth the 2 hours drive from Mountain View).</review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>After having read such great reviews online about the Treehouse Café we decided to try it for dinner. Unfortunately, we left very unsatisfied.
We ordered the bolognese pasta and the sauce tasted undone and like the sofrito base didn’t cook down enough. The special was a creamy tomato seafood pasta and it lacked flavor. We’re not too big on adding a ton of salt to food but the sauce needed it. We also ordered the cheese burger medium rare and it was brought to the table well done.
I will say that the wine pour was generous and good and the ambience was quaint and cute. However, the food did not meet our expectations. We’ve had our share of pastas in Italy and nonna’s cooking but this did not taste authentic. In fact, it stung when we received the bill and saw how much we were charged.
Being that Carmel attracts many tourists year round I hope that the Treehouse Café makes some improvements to the food.<//review><user_name>Dina Cadena< /user_name><response>None</response><rating>1</rating><Time>1593406266450<//Time>< gmapID>

Great spot. Hospitality is wonderful.  Menu is eclectic a little of everything. Delicious California and Mediterranean cuisine. Plates look great. Tastes are well thought out. Food well prepared. Good low priced wine menu with big pours. We have eaten there many times and for me it is my go to. Eat outside 1 floor above the street or more intimately inside. I highly recommend Tree House.<//Review>

Bruchetta and Veggie pasta were OK..Chicken Pesto Sandwich was great..Pasta was too expensive though..I can have better pasta at many other places for less than $18< /Text>

<Text>The food at Treehouse Cafe was very delicious. I ordered the Gyros for lunch and it was excellent, the beef was moist and not dry. It was too bad I didn't have room for the Greek burgers my companions ordered as well because they looked very very good and I wanted some too. The wait staff were very friendly and polite and very accommodating for our water requests on a hot day. I loved the decor and ambiance in the restaurant too. There was a queue for the single bathroom but that was no biggie the food and service were great!< /Text><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

<user_id>108188067025725934348< /user_id><Review>The food is amazing here. The host, waiters, bussers and cooks all worked amazing together last night as a team. The restaurant was so busy and the wait was long. I highly recommend making reservations in advance... Just don't be too upset when your reservation becomes delayed because a large group doesn't want to finish their wine. I got to give it to this restaurant last night. I made reservations for 8 pm last night.. we probably were seated around 8:30pm maybe later it was definitely crowded. The staff all were wearing masks perfectly like you would hope. Tables are spaced apart. Only con is they only have one restroom... But what can you do.

I had the calamari for an appetizer and yellow curry for dinner. My spouse has the Greek burger with salad. Both were mouth watering. I don't normally like calamari but it was a steak and cooked to perfection.
This place has a wonderful romantic atmosphere and is dog and family friendly. If you are willing to wait for a seat on the deck I think it is worth it.
Thank you staff for our best night in Carmel. A great way to end a small vacation post covid.< /Review><date>1592174536607</date>< name>

Had a great quiet meal in a quaint restaurant. We had lamb kebabs with saffron rice and a prawn pasta dish in a garlic cream sauce. Scrumptious bread. Eclectic menu . Great service. No wait and meal came within like 15 minutes.<//Text>

The ambience and setting is amazing. I called for the fish ($27) which was undercooked and tasted off. I called for extra sauce twice, it never came. The bread served with the roasted garlic does not pair well at all. The staff is friendly but no one came to check how the meal was. Other stuff we ordered was decent.</review>

Wife had lamb kabobs, I had Paella. Lamb was extremely tender and was delicious! Pasole was fantastic! Clams and mussels were tender, chicken melt in your mouth and just enough sausage to give it some spice and flavor. We both had wine which was a large pour for the price. Will definitely go back!</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005</gmapID></record>

If you take anything away from this review please remember that the food was awesome and we will be back! We enjoyed our gyro salad, platter, and lamb kabobs tremendously! The reason my review slipped from 4 to 3 stars were some logistical issues we had with our experience. First the bathroom situation is a bit limited with only one toilet for the entire restaurant and it was a bit messy and without paper towels. Second there seemed to be a lack of silver ware as we were provided set ups in waves, so first forks, then knives and napkins. Can’t wait to check back with Tree House once these two things are resolved!</Text>

<Review>Excellent food;  very nice and friendly staff; and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  We had the gyro platter, the chicken kabob platter, the hummus and the bruschetta. I honestly can't say which dish was best, because they were all so good! The restaurant itself is fun and the music they play is so welcome. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin. ..oldies galore! Definitely go if you visit Carmel.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>FG HOPKINS</user_name>< time>

<Review>Superb food! Good wine, and great service. I highly recommend the beef stroganoff, it was absolutely delicious.

The Baklava was a great addition for dessert. I will definitely visit this restaurant again, when I'm back in Carmel.< /Review><Name>Shawn Smith< /Name>< GmapID>

Great Mediterranean food with outstanding service! We sat outside on the 2nd story patio & loved the atmosphere! The gyros are really good & my husband said the pork sausage appetizer is the best sausage he's ever had! We went to lunch at 11:15 & had no problem getting a table. They are kid friendly (and dog friendly too!). We'd go back!<//Review>

We were looking for a nice, quiet place to have a date night. This place was perfect for my husband and I to get some quality time without the kids. We went on a Friday evening in early April and almost had the place to ourselves. Ambiance was romantic and relaxing and the wine and food we're wonderful. We will definitely be back. Service was top notch too.< /Review>

<Review>The place is amasing, amasing food and atmosphere but carmel.expansive, not one $ price mark.like it is said on google.maps.and yelp, between $$$ and $$$$ main courses start from.20$ to 35$ burgers from 15 to 18 salads from 12 to 22, firsts fro 6 to 17

Great music design.and.people

Stumbled across this place while strolling through Carmel. I was a little hesitant given the diverse menu, but what a great find. Staff were not just friendly but entertaining. I had the Green Curry with Chicken and would dare say most Thai restaurants could not achieve it’s fine taste. My wife had the Chicken Kabobs and was cooked to perfection and had a freshness to the meat and salad. Wonderful setting out on the patio overlooking the street with heat lamps adding to quite a cozy atmosphere.<//Text>

During a recent trip to Carmel, I ate here with family.  Food was exceptionally delicious!  A memorable meal, and beautiful setting.  Loved the outdoor dining area.

I've been to many very good restaurants over the years, but never given a 5 star rating.  This is the first!  😮☺<//review>

<text>Love this place. The food is wonderful and so are the staff. They really should have a lunch menu instead of same prices for lunch and dinner. 15 for a tuna sandwich just doesn't seem right. Prices are great for evening but a little too much for a quick bite!

We stopped at this beautiful town and found this restaurant. The rooftop plays Mediterranean music with a cozy environment. We ordered the Greek Burgers that come with a salad. Both were great! The burger was on point and super tasty. The grilled onions was amazing. The stuff was super friendly as well. Highly recommend.<//review>

The Greek burger w carmelized onion..the best w Greek side salad.
Topped off w a Lime pie & Chocolate cake for the table ..delicious.
My niece was impressed that the waiter didn't write anything down.
We all laughed & talked how professional customer service they have in Carmel by the Sea.  Very top notched food experience.
Tremendous wine selection...

Wonderful anniversary dinner last night, thank you. FANTASTIC service... the best we have had in our month in the US. The host helped us choose a delicious local wine.  I had the sea bass, which was superb.</Text>

Lovely outdoor venue, perfect for enjoying the breeze, CA sunshine, great food, and a glass of vino with a friend. Honestly, I really did feel as if I was dining in a tree house! The manager who greeted us was joyful, classy, and accommodating. The service and food was excellent. If you are on vacation, as we were, and want to experience the flavor of this quaint, charming, seaside town,  this restaurant is a must!< /text>

<Time>1575780449648< /Time><review>I rarely say a restaurant is perfect but I’m sayin it now! First of all we were super late for our Sat night reservation and they just giggled and seated us immediately- even giving us a choice of tables. The waiters are so friendly and warm and appropriately attentive and so flippin’ handsome (not that that matters). Oh yes, the food...we are vegetarians so had the Caesar salad- delish, lentil soup- the perfect blend of flavors and the veggie pasta with an incredible sauce to slide the soft yet crunchy cooked to perfection bread in. To seal the deal we had key lime pie for dessert and I know my KLPs and it was excellent. I wish I lived here so I could eat her all the time. Thanks for a delightful dining experience and comfy ambience.</review><Gmap_id>0x808de615ab8d5b45:0x39edb77f78473005< /Gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< username>

A great little eatery in Carmel, the rooftop seating area is really good, they do not take reservations but if the wait is not too long its is worth it. the food was good. had the beef stroganoff with pasta which was decent but could have maybe had a little more meat, my partner had the Gyros which was excellent. the entire experience was quaint and I would return.</Text>

We sat at the outside patio. It was nice weather, but noticed they do have heaters when needed. We had the Salmon dish, Sea Bass, Beef Stroganoff, Yellow Curry and the Ribeye special. All were delicious. Fyi, the curry was considered more spicy (than mild as stated by menu) by someone who loves spicy hot foods, so it was fine. This place is a local favorite of 2 people in our group. Was the first time for the others, but all agreed we would come back.< /Review>

<text>Food here was good, and service was excellent. We came in for a quick bite before we left on a long drive back home. We sat outside, which was very pleasant. They didn't have a kids menu, but made a small plate for my baby from one of the menu items.

One of the Hidden Gems of Carmel by the Sea, superb service amd ambient atmosphere. Ordered Lamb Kebab and Gyro Sandwich for 2 of us. Lamb meat was delicious without any extra fat and tasted awesome. Greek Salad was fresh and held to the flavor.
Certainly will havr to come back and try other great looking delicacies.
Keep up the good work.<//review>

<Text>I was expecting at least a solid 3 in dining experience, based on the overall 4.6 rating (restaurant ratings in and around Monterey seem to be artificially inflated, for some reason).

The servers were friendly, but did forget to put our appetizer order in. We got the chicken pesto pasta and the beef stroganoff. Both dishes were severely lacking in meat portions, so we ended up paying about $22 - $24 for a bowl of noodles. The meals were relatively bland and tasteless. I think this restaurant uses its location, rather than food quality, to attract customers.

The chicken pesto pasta was greasy and oily for some reason. The chicken was not great.

The beef stroganoff was the saddest thing we received. There were 5 tiny pieces of beef in a huge bowl of noodles. They advertised mushrooms in this recipe, but we found no mushrooms in the bowl. They advertise this as Russian beef stroganoff. What they neglect to mention is this is the wartime rationed meat version of Russian beef stroganoff.

Overall, we were extremely disappointed and will not be back. I don't know what's up with the 5 star reviews, but we certainly did not have a great experience. I believe just about any restaurant in the Barnyard shopping center is superior, so I recommend you go there instead.<//Text>< date>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>Pretty place for sure, but without being treated right, it's hard to appreciate it.

We were seated by an uncomfortable corner of the patio right next to where the waiters constantly walk past. That was okay, since we could've chosen to change. Once our waiter appeared, he asks us 3 questions stereotyping us, mechanically and unthinkingly. After his "revealing questions", it is soon exposed within seconds of being seated that we are vegetarians. Again, too soon and too mechanically, he gives us 3 quick options that are the only ones available to us and to let him know. Waiter quickly exits the scene.

We wonder for a few minutes on what that was and decide that this is not the experience we want to give our money for. And thus we make our exit too.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Atmosphere- 4 stars. Even though the rooftop deck in on the street, traffic sounds were low and trees in the area aw well as the building itself create a relaxing atmosphere. Dog friendly even though you have to walk through he restaurant to get to the deck.

Food. 3.5 stars.   The food was good.  We had Chicken Pesto Pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the chicken was tender.  The pesto cream sauce was rich but not oily.    They let us split the plate which was about perfect for lunch.

Service: 0 stars.  Servers were attentive and kind but I had an issue with my glass of wine.  I had an expensive glass of nice wine which I was nursing through dinner and had only had a couple of sips.

Near the end of dinner, a gust of wind flipped the table cloth up spilling my mostly full glass of wine.  I got a servers attention and told him what had happened and asked for some new napkins since ours were drenched in wine.  They  mopped up the wine with  the napkins but left a damp table and    didn't come back with new napkins.  They also didn't offer to comp or top off my glass.  That was a major fail.</Review>< Pictures>

<user_id>111367069151101343993< /user_id><Review>Great menu and lovely outdoor seating on a second level patio surrounded by trees. The lamb shank curry was perfection! A family member had suggested a visit to Carmel when we were visiting the Monteray Bay Aquarium, and everything closer to the aquarium seemed more touristy and overpriced for the quality. I am SO glad we found this little gem a short drive south. I might visit the area again solely for another meal at the Treehouse Cafe!<//Review>< Response>

<review>Totally exceeded all of my expectations. The owner is very friendly and personable and they have the best wait staff I've ever seen in a restaurant. We got there on Saturday night without a reservation and a party of 6. We were told 10 minute wait but when it took a little longer they opened up the private wine room in the back for us. Alberto was our waiter and he was fantastic. He went above and beyond. We will most definitely be coming back every time we're in town.</review><Rating>5</Rating><user>105004897118782068433< /user>< date>

Beautiful candle and snifters, ornaments, and other beautiful things for yourself or to give as gifts. They are connected to Sock Shop with many differant socks for the whole family, many differant materials like wool, cotton, and synthetic mixes, many styles and fun socks.  They also have a few special slippers for all, one pair softer than a bunny and very comfortable, baby socks for Christmas, running socks and fancy support socks.< /Review>

<text>The food was mediocre. I ordered Thai Chicken Curry and send it back b/c it was overly sweet and overly spicy with a huge chunks of veggies. They did not charged us for that but later the charge showed up. The lamb chops were too thin to turn out medium rare and not so good. Mashed potatoes looked gray and starchy, Chicken Pesto Pasta was greasy in a pool of olive oil. Baklava was like from the store pastry dough. Service was excellent though and the ambience. Wish we never have gone there. :(</text><Time>1459443662964</Time>< GmapID>

I first visited Treehouse Cafe because they were dog friendly. I return time and again for the unbelievable service. The staff treats you as family, is always happy to see you, and will do everything to make sure you have a great meal and a great time. Oh, and the food's good, too. Whether it's ribeye, paella, dolmas, or chocolate cake, I've always been happy.<//Review>

Very confusing restaurant. My family came as a party to eat up by the balcony and it was chaotic. Smoked salmon was raw without a description in the menus,meat wasn’t cooked, and servers weren’t helping and taking way to long to help, and way to pricey for something that shouldn’t be. And their paying system is too confusing and over exaggerated. I do not refer this place to you.</Text>

This place is totally overated. I went there on 1/14/2017. I ordered thai pad with prawn, and end up I found out a dishwasher wire in my plates. I inform the waiter and he just said sorry about it.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Location is very nice, good service, good food. Too expensive, like everything else in Carmel. We were there at noon, it was very busy, but the staff had everything under control. Highly recommended, even if it was not quite enough for me with five stars.

(Original)
Location ist sehr nett, guter Service, gutes Essen. Bisschen zu teuer, wie alles in Carmel. Wir waren mittags dort, es war sehr trubelig, das Personal hatte aber alles gut im Griff. Durchaus zu empfehlen, auch wenn es bei mir nicht ganz für fünf Sterne reichte.</review>
