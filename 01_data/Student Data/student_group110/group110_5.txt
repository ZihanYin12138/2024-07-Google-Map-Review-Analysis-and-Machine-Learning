< review>
Nicest people with biggest hearts I could ever meet. Took my kitten in after she has a small injury and they were super attentive. I am unfortunately unemployed right now because of the pandemic and they were able to help. God bless their hearts for everything they do. I will forever be in their debt after what they have done for me and my Pelusa.< /review>

<text>I was referred to Gateway about 10 years ago by my neighbor. I had not been here for maybe four years since my Bella passed away, until we had to bring our adopted mixed terrier dog in for vomit and bloody diarrhea. My bad review does not reflect the long wait time which is understandable due to covid, but the poor service (except the lot attendee, he is a very kind person). I was billed over nine hundred and fifty dollars for what resulted to be an upset stomach. The doctor who checked my dog said she would need to run lab test and X-rays to rule out a fracture, cancer and/or infection. After agreeing to all the test, I was told that my dog would be ready for pick up in the afternoon and that I would get notified, which I didn't. I did received a text from the doctor, who said that the test were good and there was no fracture or cancer. I went to pick him up,  I waited a bit and when the technician brought him out ..she opened the door to my car put him inside and handed me a bag with medications. The technician never explained what the medications were and how to administer the medication..I was not even told what my dog had!!! I had to ask the technician to go ask the doctor to give a run down of what my dog's diagnosis was and shortly I received a phone call from the doctor. I had to ask about the medications and my dogs condition instead of just letting me know, which I was then told it was just an upset stomach. I truly did feel like they just took my money...the care, interest, compassion that I loved from gateway is gone. I won't be returning to Gateway anymore.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1609191821525, 'text': "Denise, it's disheartening to hear that your experience with us was anything less than positive.

STEER CLEAR!!What does VCA stand for? VETERINARIAN CON-ARTISTS!!

We spayed our 5 month old puppy here a while ago. After I dropped off my dog, they called me later telling me that they needed to add blood work and it cost 89 bucks. Literally dropped it on me and had not mentioned anything about blood work when I was at the office still. Every doctor I've spoken to said it is not necessary. I felt suspicious but I was like whatever. Then later in my story you'll see that their policies are designed to make you part ways with your money. They literally don't care about your pet.

This morning I decided to give my second dog a rattlesnake vaccine bec we've been taking her on longer and longer hikes into the wilderness. I go to their app and book an appointment. The appointment was booked for a wellness service which is done by a technician. Usually vaccines. I drove there but they refused to do it because they said that they have a company policy to do an exam to the dog before they do that which means I have to pay an extra 65 bucks!! I'm like HELL NO. Why did the system let me book the exam if they had that policy? so they drop it on you while your there and it would be easier for you to break and say ok whatever take the money...Hell no!
All I need is a 30 dollar vaccine. I didn't come here to spend more than that! THAT'S A SCAM! I've had it with them and everyone should know what they are getting into here.
I'm moving both my dogs somewhere else. I heard the big box stores "where the pets go" don't have corrupt company policies like this that are designed to steal your money like that! SO I'm taking them there.

I fell for the "exam" with my first dog and I won't fall for it again. For my 1st dog, the exam consisted of them putting a stethoscope on him and saying he is good. Literally took 15 seconds. I'm like I know he is good. I take care of him better than I take care of myself! Are you gona check the benign lump on his chest? his ears for a yeast infection? His paws? his belly? Just sell me the lie better! They didn't. They started petting him and looking at him as if they are looking for something so they look like they are doing something, then they left and said thank you! They STOLE my 65 bucks for a BS physical exam!! And now they keep doing it when people are struggling in the middle of a pandemic!

What appalling level of greed are you at? Your company policies SUCK and I will not be a victim of your con-artistry again!< /Text>

I had healthy four indoor cats that got sick from this location, two died.

They went in for routine checkup and came out all four sick with two dying.

The doctor was got aggressive and angry and very defensive when I brought it to his attention.

The owner/vet lack of empathy and runs a subpar veterinary service that doesn't wipe down and sanitize the tables.

If you love your animals, I would not take them to this place.

this happened back in 2015 if anyone else experienced the same thing please reach out to me.<//Text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Bad story at first, but they redeemed themselves w/ extremely good prices compared to almost all other vets I've been to, as well as going out of their way to accommodate me....

My dog got a laceration on his toe that required stitches. I took him in at 8am, only to be turned away 2 hours later bc they didn't have time to fix him. After calling about 20 other vets in LA area, being quoted about $1200 by a few of them, & told by the rest that they had no availability, I went back here to just have him looked at so I could get antibiotics & pain meds as well as try to make an appointment to be seen on their next surgery day. I checked in then waited almost 3 hours, only to be told that they got confused bc I was there earlier. I basically got cast aside & forgotten about.

I was told to come back the next day (which isn't a surgery day on Saturdays) at 7:30am to make sure I'm at the front of the que, & that they would make him stable & comfortable until I could get him stitched up.

Here's where they redeemed themselves... They came to get him relatively fast, & actually made the time to fully repair the wound right then, even tho it's not a surgery day.

I've been here w/ 2 different dogs now. One for a really bad split nail, and this dog w/ the laceration. The nail repair cost me about $246 after a $31 discount they gave me for some reason, but even without a discount, that is a great price! The laceration repair cost me $515 for everything.

Not once did the doctors try to use scare tactics to push unnecessary treatments, tests, vaccines, or prescription food like I've experienced soooo many times before w/ other vets who prey on worried or unknowledgeable pet owners.

To sum things up, the staff is very nice/knowledgeable & their prices are the best I know of in the LA area, but this clinic can be rough in terms of limited hours of operation, long wait times, & no guarantee that they can treat your pet that day depending on the situation. This can be solved by either making an appointment or getting there about 30 min before they open for walk-ins. I'd rather take my chances here than go to another vet and be grossly over-charged!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1605535515638, 'text': "Thank you for taking a moment to share your honest thoughts with us about your experiences.

<Review>On Friday, I took my kitten into the VCA Gateway Animal Hospital for a Paw he got caught in a Door.  They charged $600 for Xray, meds, and a Paw Bandage (that is pretty expensive).  The VCA's Vet told me to immediately bring back my Kitten if the Bandage was severely soiled/wet.  Vet said it's urgent if bandage is soaked and it needs to be changed ASAP.

I arrived to the VCA at 2:30pm on Monday with a cat that had stepped in feces and then tried to wash it in his water bowl.  VCA turned me away, hours before their scheduled close time.  All I needed was a simple bandage changed out, and I had already paid them $600 for this injury.  Probably $2,000 this year alone at Gateway.

This is the worst customer service, they should have picked up the phone and called me while I was sitting outside with my injured Kitten.  What Animal Hospital in their right mind turns someone away with an injured Kitten 3.5 hours before posted close by text message???

Please note, we've been a customer at the VCA Gateway Hospital since 2012, 8 years.  Once Gateway Hospital changed management they've become more focused on financials instead of the well being of your animal  (constantly up-selling you on cat insurance). We've decided to cancel our future appointments and take all 4 cats to a Vet that isn't as greedy or too big for customer service.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0e71da2b87d:0x85f435a918772477</Gmap_id>< response>

I did not want to even leave a review but I am so frustrated with this VCA Gateway. I found Gateway years ago after being fed up with a VCA that is walking distance from my house. When VCA took that clinic over it became just a big money grab and I see nothing has changed. The vet there encouraged me to change my flea treatment  and they offered me a two for one deal. The one I was buying was not available through them. Of course the new treatment did not work and when I took all the meds back for a refund they told me I owe more because I was returning two boxes! That makes no sense.  I LOVED my Gateway vet who was recommended by a friend who used them as well. Since becoming a VCA facility this office has entirely too many patients. The phone hold times are at least 20 minutes for everything if they pick up the phone at all. I called again this a.m. (after trying two days last week and not getting through) to get a Rx transferred elsewhere and was told they would do it right away and call me back with the answer to a question for the vet. They are charging double the price for the meds. They also never call you back. I called again and waited ten minutes for someone to answer and was put on hold until it started to ring again. 16 minutes of  rings later the call disconnected. They never called the outside pharmacy. Any visits are at least an hour wait time before you are seen regardless of when you go. My last visit took over two hours to pick up food and get my dogs nails clipped. They have also started up charging for all meds so do yourself a favor and call around before you pay for meds. The most common meds can often be found at Costco for 50% less. They will also recommend services that you probably don’t need to increase your bill. I am so sad to leave our regular vet who saved my dogs life when his lower limbs became paralyzed but I can’t take it anymore. Our regular vet is now not often available and the other vets are the ones recommending expensive unnecessary procedures. My friend who recommended them left a few years ago and now I have to start looking elsewhere too. I’ve put it off as long as I could but the total disregard for my time and the increased bills are too much. I can just no longer trust that they have my pets best interest at heart. They also left my pets ashes thrown on a shelf for over a week like trash without ever contacting me to pick them up. The front desk staff is very friendly when you can get them on the phone but this place is a far cry from what it used to be. VCA has taken over MANY privately owned clinics in the last few years. If you love your animals and value your time and money beware.</Text>

I've given this place a 5-star review before. Before it became a VCA. there's been a lot of changes especially with the front desk. As a gay woman sometimes I deal with discrimination and I've never felt that way until yesterday at VCA Gateway Animal. I have a partner and we have three pets together and I remember when this other woman worked there and she was just so welcoming and so awesome and I'm tired of them not respecting the fact that I am in a same-sex relationship and I need to my partner to be referred to  as either my partner or my girlfriend but it keeps getting written off and just said as friend and that is so rude. I have a another thing, their practice has gone down the drain. I probably spent about $5,000 on two different animals there this year and was completely screwed over at least three of the five times that I've gone. it was definitely some malpractice that happened yesterday with my cat and I wish I could get all of my money back. Every single penny. I ended up taking my cat to a different vet who is a friend and well respected and won't lie to me or try to sell me something I don't need and who actually put a catheter in with a bag. Because who puts a catheter and it doesn't have a bag and let's piss get all over your cat. honestly you guys should check yourselves when going here if you've been customers for years because a lot of things have changed especially the price but also the fact that they lie to you and the fact they don't treat you with respect . Besides this review, I will be taking things further.< /text>

Worst vets I’ve ever worked with. The first vet didn’t listen to anything I said about what was wrong with my dog. Charged me $400 for things my dog didn’t need. After I confronted him, he suggested I see the other vet. The other vet was defensive at first but actually examined my dog properly and started to treat him. An extra $500 later, they’re refusing to discount because they refunded a $200 THAT MY DOG DIDNT NEED.
Not to mention, the second vet called me to say the treatments weren’t working, quoted me an even higher price, THEN HUNG UP ON ME. This is absolutely atrocious behavior and customer service.

However, every single person except for the two vets had wonderful customer service and was super friendly.
Especially Courtney. Very nice and friendly and helpful</Text>

<Text>Worst experience. 1. Gave me the wrong hours over the phone, they said 8am-12pm however they stop seeing people after 11am. 2. I've had my old vet fax over records 3 times and still they cannot be found. They said it must have not of gone through but each time there was a confirmation number. 3. The tech kept holding my dog like a backback and not like a football, he has major spine issues and is post-op. 4.

Waited 3.5 hrs to get back my dog  for an ear infection.  Tons of people came after me and left before me and i was being upsold for treatment. It was actually added to my bill without it being discussed with me first.< /Review>

<Review>Gateway Animal Hospital is by far one of the greatest hospitals I've been to. I use to go before their big expansion and upgrade so I don't know what it looks like inside but I can only imagine it looks great. I had a boxer, which he was a rescue, and I took him to my normal vet for the standard stuff. Once I noticed a lump on him...my vet recommended another hospital. They wanted an absurd amount of money just to run test. Gateway was recommended to me by a work college so I decided to try them. They were not only  very professional and courteous...they were half the cost of the other hospital.  All of the doctors that treated my dog were great. They explained what was going on, what were my options and all of the associated costs. Unfortunately his cancer grew to fast before I can do anything but I have always recommended Gateway to everyone that has pets. And when I'm able to get another dog, I will definitely be taking him/her to Gateway!< /Review>< pics>

I have been a client since 2001. This is an awesome place to come to I have brought in all of my pets here. I have tried other places and was never satisfied. And here all of the staff has always been wonderful. Everyone is always so sweet and caring all of the receptionist are great specially Valerie and Blanca they are always willing to help and explain everything so well. I can honestly say they saved my dog's life.< /Text>

Took my puppy for a follow up visit due to some bacterial infection on his back and was seen by Dr. Woods. She suggested to get some lab work but never mentioned how expensive this procedure was going to be. Of course i felt upset once it was time to settle the bill. My blue nose pup received a cortisone injection that was supposed to help with the infection but so far it hasn't  cleared up his back so i called again and after playing tag with the Doc over the phone she suggested i come in so we can decide on a new treatment. I hope this works so I'm holding out on how efficient and trustworthy these guys are.<//text>

< review>
We had very high expectations for this place, given the many raving reviews, but we've been extremely disappointed. We've seen two different doctors for the same problem, and neither of them will even listen to what we tell them. They both had this elitist attitude to them, as if whatever we have to say doesn't matter at all. We've showed pictures and videos of how our dog behaves at home, in an environment that's familiar and safe for him, but the doctors refuse to even take those videos and pictures into account, only because our dog isn't behaving the same way here. Dogs not showing that they're in pain when at the vet is apparently something that Dr. Ruiz and Dr. David Ta have never seen before.

You guys really need to work on your listening skills, and stop jumping to conclusions.

I really can't recommend this place to anyone who has any kind of non-standard problem.<//review>

It’s a mess place with a looot of animals inside. The sanitary condition is bad, I brought my cat there once and he got eye infection. And one male doctor said my cat is very unhealthy and his teeth were broken that need to schedule a surgery to fix it. But when I go for another doctor, she said my cat is very healthy and doesn’t have any problem on his teeth. Well, really don’t recommend this place. You should find elsewhere that doctors truly care and love your pets.</text>

Was able to get 3 of my cats spayed here for absolutely nothing! This is with a voucher I picked up at the shelter which I qualified being low income.  Not all vets take this voucher so the fact that they happily do just makes me smile! More vets should do the right thing and help out our communities. I will be taking g all my animals here from now on since they have reasonable prices for once. I'm just so gratefu!<//Text>

This place is disgusting. They don’t care about the animals well being at all and are more concerned with their lunch break.  The customer service is atrocious. They treated me and my cat horribly.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
I had just moved to LA a couple of months  ago and brought my dog Olive in for a bordatella vaccination.  I appreciated they took her without an appointment, and the staff was very nice.  However the vet I saw was not competent.  First of all, he was immediately scared of my dog and suggested we muzzle her because he was worried about being bitten.  She has never bitten anyone and I've never had any vet ever be afraid of her.  Typically, vets try and make her more comfortable and feel safe...not the other way around.  When he was inspecting her ears he hurt her and when she yelped, he jumped back like she was going to hurt him.  It was bizarre and unsettling.  THEN...and this is the worst part...he asked if I wanted to get both the inhalable and injectable vaccination.  I had never heard of an injectable vaccination so I told him I'd stick w what I knew..the inhalable.  And he told me that would only be good for a week or two.  I thought that was bizarre and immediately lost confidence in him and told him I'd again stick with what I knew...the inhalable.  While I was waiting to pay he did comoe out and let me know that I was correct...the inhalable is good for a year.  This is a very common vaccination....I was surprised and dismayed that any vet would not know this.  I'm glad I didn't need to trust my pets health to this vet in a more critical situation.< /Review>

<Review>AVOID THIS PLACE.
They majorly botched my cat's spay surgery (LEFT AN OVARY INSIDE HER. Seriously. And the surgery was very stressful on kitty.) and killed my friend's dog with their incompetence. Both events I was a direct witness. NB- a lot of these reviews with 5 stars are for euthanasia. Yes they are really good at ending your pet's life. I'll give them that.

I filed a complaint with the the CA vet board but their investigation was inconclusive.
I have multiple friends and colleagues take their pets here because their prices are low and have horrible experiences. GO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Seriously consider going elsewhere and paying a little more. The VCA or Village Vet or anywhere else really. Your beautiful little animal is too important.<//Review></record>

I can't say enough good things about Gateway. I have basically lived there for the past month...it all started when I rescued 6 kittens and the mom from a horrible building manager (Brimco Management) who was locking the kittens under the building, then dousing them with pesticide. I've never been so horrified. This was my next door neighbor building. Another blog will come about this; but onto Gateway for now...I caught these kittens, and brought them in 1, 2, 3 at a time - ALWAYS, the girls at the desk were A.M.A.Z.I.N.G, super compassionate and really worked with me. The kittens were spayed/neutered, received medical attention and  flea medication. The place is PACKED, but Jessica, the front desk manager always gets everyone through the process in a reasonable time. I was always treated kindly, compassionately. It's amazing how quickly they take care of so many animals. Even the parking attendant was kind, helped me carry in the kittens, and addressed me by my name. Nicole, one of the receptionist/techs - amazing and sweet girl even found someone to adopt one of the kittens. They all jumped in and helped! They posted my flyers, and helped with posting adoptions. Jess, another of the girls at the front desk was absolutely wonderful. So caring and compassionate about the animals, as was Blanca (sweetheart) and Naisha, also so helpful and thoughtful. They took time, worked with me on the bills and made sure that the treatments I was doing was what was needed. They shared photos of their own animals with me. They are fantastic. I also had good experiences with the doctors as well, although didn't have as much contact with them, but the animals were properly cared for, and the vets explained the treatments to me, and why these treatments were needed. This was a really tough experience for me, and I can honestly say I've never been treated so well by a group of women as these girls at Gateway. They are professional, compassionate and truly love and care for animals. They went well above and beyond to help me, and I am very grateful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!< /Review>

I have been bringing my pets to Gateway since 1982. My animals have enjoyed long, wonderful lives thanks to the stellar care of Dr.. Villicana and his staff. My little miniature Schnauzer, Kelly, who just turned 16 in May, has nearly died several times and is only alive and with me because of the great individualized care she has received from Gateway.</text>

<Text>Took my new puppy here with very high expectation and multiple recommendations.
Staff was all very “nice.” That’s the 2stars)
However, it was super packed and very small. Parking attendant was a joke. We were pushed along a chain of 6 different people during the visit. Non of whom talked to one another and it was all very impersonal. No one knew what the last person said and the doctor couldn’t be bothered to give me a full rundown post check up. I left very unsure of what happened and how to proceed afterwards. Easily because of their volume, “first come first serve” and 10 other policies about appointments on the window, I understand. It was all just very unorganized and not the first trip to the vet I was hoping for.
After that mess, I called to get answers and confirm worm meds and was never called back and I seemed to be bothering the vet tech with this simple request which wasn’t even resolved. Were getting my records transferred and going elsewhere next time.
First impressions mean a lot to return buisness.
Update:
Got a call from the doctor with answers and resolutions. 3stars overall. Thanks!

Over the last 30+ years, I've been bringing my dogs here. Over this period of time, I've worked in Glendale and my dogs have been seen by several of their staff members. Most recently, Dr. Polanco has been our doctor and has taken excellent care of my dog, Jill. This past week has been very difficult as I made the decision to put down our beloved Jill following months of failing health and increasing age. Their medical staff and fast office have always been very helpful and for that I am deeply grateful.</Review>

They have provided professional care and attentive support to our Molly for 15+ years. This past year was especially trying with her coyote bite surgery, nasal tumor, thyroid problem, arthritis, and her frequent toe nail trims, so she could avoid slipping on tile floors. She would not have lived as long as she had without their care. They were always there to attend to her health needs, big and small. We are extremely grateful for the caring professionalism they always offered. Dr. Villicana has been with us through three dogs now.  Doctors Polanco and Ruiz were Molly's excellent doctors through most of this past year. Victoria's sweet warmth and kindness made us feel less stressed whenever Molly visited.  Jessica and Dr. Ruiz personally came out to comfort us when we brought Molly in for the last time. Their kind words of sympathy for our loss meant a lot to us.< /text>

SOB... the amount of rude snarky and unprofessional behavior is something that needs attention ASAP ,. our 2 babies are brother and sister 12 years old (people years) and i could not walk out leaving them there in the "care" of this person who wasted no time in smart mouthing me ,ignoring me on purpose , and the other one ganged up on me as is we were in the GHETTO.  so i wasn't leaving them there unattended in their  loving care sorry!  NEVER! i'm there to protect them and i will ! if things don't change were leaving,sorry i was recommended 12 years ago from a close fiend who's also doing the same . New building New prices but tacky nasty behavior.  your taking a huge step backwards gateway!<//Text>< Time>

<Review>I took my 8 week old furbaby Chihuahua Zoe   for her first round of vaccines and physical. Her vet was wonderful.  He gave me really useful tips for training which will come in handy as she grows. The  front staff just gushed over lil Zoe. I was pleasantly surprised  at the low cost of her visit.  I have paid twice as much for less service elsewhere.  I definitely recommend this hospital.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0e71da2b87d:0x85f435a918772477</Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< username>

We've been bringing Nyx to Gateway Hospital every week for over a month and we want to thank them for all they've done for us. Although our little nyxie bun has crossed rainbow bridge we know they helped her out so much and she was still happy til the end. We will greatly appreciate everything they were able to do.< /review>

Off to the vet we go
With three rabbits and a cat in tow

There would have been more
But Dexter ducked out the door
"I'll not go this week"
He said as out he I sneak

I chased him a bit
Then let him home sit

"It's okay, Little Guy"
I said with a sigh

There's always next time;
Parking doesn't cost a dime

Then you can go too
When Madge also is due</review>< pictures>

We saw Dr. Teves, he explored all of the possible options of what could be wrong with her and was so great when answering all of my questions. Through the process of elimination and after trying other things to help her  we decided surgery  was our best option. I didn't feel pressured or rushed into making the choice.  After the surgery was over he personally called to let us know how it went  and even though I know they are always busy he took the time to answer all of my questions on the phone. Considering the fact that she had blood work, xrays, medication, 3 office visits, and ultimately surgery,  the bill was very resonable and the care was fantastic. The ladies at the front desk were friendly, and even double checked when I had additional questions about my cats aftercare. I was feeling so stressed about my kitties sickness but the care and attention I received here really helped to alleviate some of that. I have been bringing my cats here for years and can't imagine taking them anywhere else. I always recommend Gateway to people who are looking for compassionate, professional and affordable care for their animals.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Avoid at all costs ... unless you want the most impersonal arbitrarily priced inconsistent piss-poor treatment possible for your beloved pet. From the Stepford-like young women who run the front desk to the mixed bag of doctors who staff this shoddy place you can't help but feel bad about being there and most importantly bringing your pet there. I don't know why I have been going there for nearly six years because in all that time I was never made to feel welcome or secure ... two things so vital when it comes to seeking good care for your pet. And today when I finally started to verbalize my feelings to the staff Dr. Villacana (sp?), who I had never met before, happens to walk out and overhear me and without even asking for an explanation immediately snarls at me and tells me to go find myself another vet. How incredibly warm and reassuring. And he is old enough to know so much better. Not "I'm sorry you feel that way," or "How can we do better?" but "We don't want your money if you're going to question the way in which we steal it out of your pocket." I could go on and on about all the bad experiences I have had at this so-called "animal hospital" over the years but I can sum it up best by saying that for the most part the doctors are more like contractors, less interested in providing thoughtful cost-conscious care for your pet than in landing the biggest job possible. On my last visit as I was asking Dr. Jorge Ruiz questions about my dog he literally started walking out of the room and with one foot out of the examining room door said, "The girls are waiting for your payment up front," never even explaining what I would be charged for or bothering to mention that I was to bring back my dog in two and a half weeks for an important follow-up treatment. I know, I know: I said I wasn't going to go on and on... I am so done.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c0e71da2b87d:0x85f435a918772477<//gmap_id><Name>Ed Hanke< /Name></record>

<text>Gateway Animal Hospital was the right choice for my  nearly 15 year old rat terrier Gizmo who fell off a high curb off Mulholland  Dr on the night on August 2, 2016.  I turned my back on my 3 pups on the sidewalk for 3 seconds and I heard this horribly loud scream come from somewhere very close. When i looked at my dogs , only two were there and they were sniffing a white plastic bag in the gutter so I thought. As I got closer I realized it was my dog Gizmo laying there lifeless.  I thought she had a heart attack & died right there so I picked her up and ran her into my friends house and suddenly she revived.  She was a little shaky on her feet but she ended up being fine so I thought.

Within the next two days she began having a hard time walking with her back legs so I took her to Gateway to be checked. They did x-rays and found she had arthritis in her lower spine. Steroids, pain killers & bed rest was what Gizmos instructions were for the next few weeks. Her back leg paralysis got worse in the next few days so I brought her in again,& then again two days after that. I was at Gateway 5 or 6 times total and then on August 17th Gizmo passed away at home.  The doctors at Gateway didn't charge me the last 3 visits I was there with her and I appreciated that so much since I am not working and haven't been able to find work in my field. They did what they could & i know that , but the kindness of not charging me was an act of caring for their patients and owners both in times when other vets could of taken advantage of the situation. Thank you Gateway Staff from Lance Mandernack & Gizmo Mandernack</text>< pictures>

< review>
We have been bringing our Sofi here for years! Before Sofi, our cat Missy. I was referred by my long time friend who has brought all of her 12 cats and rescues. I referred my friend who brought her dog here as well, and she loves the staff and Drs. They sent her flowers when her dog passed and called to see how she was doing! Our Dr. is  Jimmerson, and he makes us feel like Sofi is a personal friend of his. The genuine care and compassion they have for not just the animals, but the pet owners as well is so comforting. I don't even understand why someone would come her to slander somebody's business as did this ficticious Christina Gregory did. My first thought when I saw the opening statement was B***S***! Nobody stays in business as long as Gateway has by incompetency, and if you've ever experienced this establishment, you'd know how incredibly ridiculous this write up is! All I have to say is Karma is a b**** Christina!</review>

Our dog almost died under the care of jimerson. Misdiagnosed, over medicated and never did he or the hospital itself take interest or responsibility. Mistakes happen but a disinterest in the mistake is absolutely inexcusable. Go on yelp and see this is a pattern. Good luck!<//review>

<Text>My good friend passed away from kidney failure November 19, 2011. January of 2000 he moved into my Cabin in the Angeles National Forest, Atladena, Ca. after living in the forest on his own for approximately two years. His first visit to Gateway was June 14th, 2000, that was a pleasant experience, as were the rest of the routine visits. May 21st, 2009 he was diagnosed with an overactive thyroid, Gateway treated him through July 18, 2009.

We had to vacate the Angeles National Forest on Aug 29th, 2009 because of the Station Fire that caused serious damage to the Canyon. Sweedee's follow up thyroid issue was treated in Northern California by Pacifica Pet Hospital until his passing. I want to thank Gateway for their caring service and dedication.</Text>< Time>

Thanks to Dr. Villacana, Dr. Prezkopt, and all the staff at Gateway for remembering my dear animal's birthday.  This is my favorite Animal Hospital.<//review>

{'time': 1576083091256, 'text': 'Sofia, we can assure you that such errors are not representative of our collective diligence in making sure we’re always organized and sensitive about such things. It should also be said that, upon looking into our records over the last several years, we’re unable to find anyone with your name. Our facility has also evolved to become VCA Gateway Animal Hospital, so if you were a client several years ago, the experience that you’re describing is not reflective of who we are in the present day. We express condolences about your pet’s passing, but it’s also important for us to reiterate that it’s unlike us to send out reminder cards when a pet has passed. If you’d like to follow up with us further about this, please email our hospital manager at vcagatewayglendale@vca.com. Sincerely, VCA Gateway Animal Hospital'}< /Response>

We've been bringing our animals to Gateway since 1982 and would never go anywhere else. And I will say, Kelly has had a tough year and if it weren't for Dr. Przekop she would not have made it to her 15th birthday. She would never have made it without the wonderful care she has received from Gateway. We have taken her there since she was a puppy!</review>

<review>They took care of Zoe with her fluids. No matter what is happening there is always a smiling face and someone saying hello, take a seat, we will take her back in a moment.

We stopped by here randomly while driving through town and I am so glad we did! First off, the service was excellent. Everyone was super friendly. The food was excellent as well! I had a calzone and my wife had the buffalo chicken pizza and both were fantastic.<//review>

<Text>I have tried to get deliver after maybe 12 successfully orders. Now they can't read GPS apparently or give a courtesy call to say lost. The current manager and staff did not deliver my order or call me. Then when I called to find food 1 hr 45 min later told me driver tried to call me 3 times. Lied..  I can come pick up or would re-charge me to try and deliver my now 2 hr old food again. Ridiculous,  incompetent,  disappointed with manager. Owner should fire staff. I live .09 miles away.  I will NEVER RECOMMEND OR EAT HERE AGAIN. very disappointing.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Buffalos pizza USED to be my favorite place to order from and my kids loved them....Unfortunately for us every time we’ve ordered the last few months my order was wrong. I would call and say next time can you make sure to get it right. Never asked for anything, even though I was charged for topping I’d never get at $2.50 per. This time I called and AGAIN they get it wrong. So I call back and I tell them and ok they’ll send a new one, I open my cheese bread and I can see the bread, again! Not enough cheese. So I call back, Brandon the manager is dialing the phone not realizing he answers, then says he will need the pizza back (it had red instead of white sauce) I wasn’t going to eat it due to not wanting to be in pain. As I start to talk he hangs up the phone. So I call back, and Brandon is the acting manager and is RUDE!!!! I asked about new management or owner because what ever the change is sucks and he is not a good manager and shouldn’t be dealing with complaints. He has an attitude. When I told him I let him know about my previous problems he asked if I called and when I said yes he said who was that manager you talked to cause he wasn’t sure if I was telling the truth. He said the owner made some changes, and when I asked for him to bring it to the owner it isn’t working he copped even more attitude and said they won’t be going anywhere. The only reason they get this many stars is because they have good dough. But for the family and community feel you used to get when paying higher prices. Not worth it anymore. Just order round table and it’ll save you a few and they don’t normally mess up your order and then cop attitude when you tell them.< /review>< user_name>

I only stopped here to pick up a food order for doordash. I didn't even know it was here, but I spoke with the owner while in there & he's a very nice man. The prices seemed good, looked like a family place/kid friendly. It smelled really good too.<//review>

Pizza was really good. Went in midday to a cleared out house. Most orders are call in from what I noticed. Prices weren't high but definitely weren't on the cheap side. Reasonable considering the pizza quality.</Text>

This is by far the best pizza I have had in the area.  We tried Italian Brothers and a few others in the area and all of their red sauce gave us heartburn.  Not at Buffalo's, seems they are one of the few places in this area that still cooks their pizza sauce the way it should be cooked, all damn day.  Also it may seem like they charge a bit much for each toppings, but honestly it's worth it because the toppings are fresh and plentiful.  The atmosphere is that of a neighborhood pizza joint with a little arcade area, lots of TV's, a small bar, and even a coinop pool table.  We will be back, and when we can't make it to the restaurant we will order in for delivery.  This is our new go to pizza spot.< /Text>

<Review>Buffalos pizza is the best! Excellent & courteous employees, excellent food from salads, calzones, sandwiches & delicious pizza. Lots of toppings, cheese oh and a wide variety of beer on tap or bottles of beer. If you're in the neighborhood it's definitely worth a stop!</Review>< rating>

Pizza is good but customer service is awful and rude specially a young lady that has tattoos on her arms she laughed of me because I was waiting for my pizza for a along
time and I asked why she made like 4 or 5 orders if I was first and I ordered before them. She laughed when I tried to talk to the manager and the manager believe her and defender her by saying that they were so busy but he didn't care that I was waiting because she was doing another orders that were after mine. So sad that people like her are on customer service working</Text>

<review>The pizza itself was quite good, however the atmosphere could have been better. I went with my coworkers for a team meeting. There's fairly limited seating so we had to get the biggest table (which has a lazy Susan-esque dias in the middle of the table, but it doesn't actually rotate...). This table was right next to the pool table (so much so that my boss almost got hit in the head with a pool cue!). For the majority of the meal, we could also smell fairly strongly a combination of weed and vape smoke, mostly likely from the folks playing pool. This place would be okay for a night out with friends, but not for anything even vaguely professional.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Surprisingly good.  We took a break here, had a pitcher of beer, took in a game of pool, and got a Hawaiian pizza.  There was a little rif-raf outside and some questionable people inside, but it was expected.  A little pricey, but we were pleased.< /review>

They have the most monstrous looking pieces I've ever seen 42 in of different varieties. I prefer however the pasta.</review>

<Text>they have lost my business. i placed an order (45 min wait) and waited an hour before calling them back to see where my food was. they tell me my card was declined (no reason for this) and that they tried to call me ( i have no missed calls). i offer to pay in cash they say they close in 11 min they cant deliver anymore. this is the 3rd time something like this has happened so i try and speak to a manager who tells me theirs nothing they can do and hangs up on me.</Text></record>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Amazing pizza and great customer service.  The dough was airy, soft on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside, perfect!  The toppings were all fresh and the sauce was very tasty.  I'm going back again whenever I feel like I want some pizza.  We ordered the biggest size.  FYI we used to be customers of Riccos but their pepperonis have been off for quite some time so we quit going there.  This is my new favorite place :)<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I love coming here with my mother ! Its a great place to have a nice family dinner and play a few games of pool! My ONLY complaint is that it is sometimes a little bit too cold inside in my opinion.< /Review>

Great pizza, great staff... plus they deliver which helps when it's too hot to leave the apartment.  Make sure to try the calzone too.  Haven't try the subs yet, but plan to try the Philli steak soon.< /Text>

<date>1614722593740<//date><rate>5<//rate><Review>I am currently enjoying my new 12x16 Premier Tall Ranch Tuff Shed. I worked with Quentin Burt to get all the build and permit details sorted.  The building turned out exactly like the one I designed on the Tuff Shed website, and I could not be happier with it.  Every part of the process was explained clearly, and expectations were consistently met, or exceeded.  The installers were fast, courteous, and professional. My only problem is now I have to improve my house to make it look as nice as the shed does! Thanks Tuff Shed, and thanks Quentin!<//Review>< pictures>

Very POOR/BAD customer service.   Will lie to you and then blame you for it.  For a client to spend almost 5k dollars and be treated like a 5 year old. Bad bad bad.  Borris the installer was awesome.  I like the product but due to the poor customer service I will not by another product for any if my other properties.< /review>

<Review>Ordered the Premier Barn Shed 12x10.  Quentin Burt is an exceptional asset to Tuff Shed.  This is the 3rd shed in the past 5 years that he has handled for my family.  He knows and understands the business, very knowledgeable with city codes, and makes the building portion of the shed easy.  Installation was on time and completed in one day.  Thanks again, Quentin!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1616008487400, 'text': 'We appreciate you choosing to work with our team at Tuff Shed Sacramento again, Edward.

<Text>Do not buy with Tuff Shed! You are better buying from any other Shed place! I purchased a lovely shed that they had displayed outside. I waited for the shed to go into production and to be delivered. I understand that cause of Covid-19 it is backed up on delivery I don't have a problem with that its fine, but however I do have a problem with the way I received my shed! Damaged and bent material and used material! I did not want to accept it but the installers told me that they are just installers not the fabricators and this is what they have that I need to contact the manufacturer. I said ok but I don't want that damaged used shed and they said if they take it back I will have to pay 15% of the price! In short they are telling me that I'm forced to take the broken used shed or else I will have to pay for their broken used shed! They installed it and they did absolutely their best in trying to make it work but however even with their best they cannot fix the manufacturer defects. The shed has nail holes all over it, because it has been used before and disassembled then sent to me. It has cracks and many other defects. The roof is basically holding on a nail! I contacted customer service and was sent to Warranty manager John and it looks like he is the only guy that actually answers the phone, but however he claims that because of Covid-19 they are using any wood they have left in storage. In short used material. He said they will fix the holes with silicone. That is absolutely horrible because with in a year or less that silicone will form mold. I have that experience with where I live. I contacted the seller Tom and showed him the status of my shed and even he was shocked. He said he was going to send all the pictures and everything to the main manager of Tuff Shed and the only person that is actually trying to do anything is John, the so called main manager basically tuck his tail between his legs and disappeared from this earth because I was supposed to get a call within 24 hours..weeks passed and I didn't get anything. I'm stuck with a USED shed that was sold to me for NEW price. Absolutely horrible quality and material. Unsafe and a big safety hazard. It is like buying a new car and receiving the car with dents and being told that if you don't take it they will charge 15% of the price and when you are forced to take it they tell you they will take it to the shop and pull the dents out. Doesn't make it new, but I'm guessing NEW and USED is the same word to Tuff Shed. Everyone please stay away from this company! They scam, lie, hustle, and their people in power ignore. Save your money and you are better with any other shed company, even a handyman will do a better job than their 2year old that fabricates their wood. They do not stand by their word on quality at all! Have a look at my pictures. If you want a shed like mine with those problems, then by all means go buy Tuff Shed. Pictures speak louder than words. I was going to buy bigger sheds into a house size with Tuff Shed but after this NEVER AGAIN! I don't recommend to anyone to use this company! A file has been claimed to the Better Business Bureau, hopefully they can resolve and report this company. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Stay away from Tuff Shed and stay safe! God Bless.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I purchased a shed for $5500 a week ago and the design they gave me was of a shed with light brown walls and brown trim. When the shed arrived however it was not light brown; it was basically white. It doesn't match anything in my backyard and it sticks out like a sore thumb.

I talked to the installers and asked them what could be done to fix it before this shed is put together onsite. They made the call into the office and ultimately came back and said that the office wouldn't allow them to paint it a new color.

I spoke with Quentin Burt, the salesman who sold me the shed and he argued with me defensively for 8 minutes stating that I picked the colors and he only put it in the computer. I explained to him that it doesn't match his design and he actually hung up the phone on me!

I called back and spoke with the manager. He was like a robot on repeat. The fine print of the contract says that colors are an approximation. He was literally screamed at me that they have no obligation to repaint and that I could take it as is or return it. I asked how much would it be to repaint and he said it would cost $400. I asked why didn't you start with that? He said because they are not paying for it. They refused to repaint it the same day however regardless if I paid for it or not.

Besides being entirely the wrong color the shed seems fine. Suffice it to say this place will never get any future business from me.<//Text>< date>

Tuff Shed built a 16 x 24 Premiere Pro Ranch garage for me and I am satisfied with the final product and the customer service provided.

The build wasn't flawless, but Tuff Shed addressed the problems and fixed it in a timely manner.  Ben and his crew showed up as scheduled, on time, and worked continuously while they were here.  A section of the wall was damaged during the build and was replaced without me having to ask.  There were some small pieces that weren't installed by the time the crew left.  After contacting Tuff Shed a crew member was sent out to put in the finishing touches and he even helped me secure the shed doors better.

Quentin helped me through the whole process from ordering to the final inspection.  He did a phenomenal job with quickly answering and addressing any questions or concerns I had.  He gave great advice and was willing to go out of his way to help me with measurements and paint.  Without his help the build would not have moved along in the timeline given.

Thank you to the Tuff Shed crew and a HUGE thank you to Quentin!< /Text>

The lady who runs it for tough shed is totally awesome and people like her make tough shed what it is and why they get all the sales they do. I tried 6 times through Home Depot to purchase a small one and they wouldn’t help me, so I finally went into the main office of tough shed and Met with Kimberly, she sold me a medium size one with all the accessories for under 6000, and that’s including installation , foundation peers, Windows, insulation’s, benches and window boxes n doors a Dutch door. It really looks like a Tiny house but I’m making it my She Shed. Thanks tough she’s for having such high quality products and good sales reps that really represent you. Also everything is Covid safe and all precautions are taken at this location, so if your looking to add a room, have a man cave or she shed or granny pad, come on down to Tharp and go into tough she’s and see Kim, tell em Denise sent ya!!!!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Everyone at Tuff Shed , Sacramento, Are fantastic. We had some sheds installed about 3 years ago and during a recent wind storm, we lost a lot of shingles off one of the roofs.I called about some warranty work on this shed,{7 year warranty}. I expected a little runaround based on the amount of time. NOPE the Lady Jessica, and everyone else were so polite, helpful and wanted nothing more than to make things right.The Tech showed up on time, SO polite and professional, did the repairs and even removed all the old shingles, without being asked. All this and still I was thanked for being their customer. What a perfect business model. WOW I am so impressed.
THANK YOU , Tuff Shed of Sacramento.
Most sincerely,

Nothing about this shed was built to current building standards. It's the most expensive shed on the market behind built and installed by the lowest bidder. Beware!</Review>< response>

<userid>114087689478724011209< /userid><text>My experience with Tuff Shed was horrible. I purchased a shed through a third party (Home Depot) and I was told the shed would be delivered in 4-6 weeks, well that was almost 8 weeks ago now and no shed, no call from anyone at Tuff shed. Originally the shed I purchased from Home Depot included delivery through Tuff Shed. My wife and I tried calling Tuff Shed multiple times since week 4 with no response at all we only got a voicemail. Never had a single return call from anybody. When we called Home Depot to check on what was going on, they explained a note Tuff Shed put into our account said they had tried contacting us but that is an outright lie, we have been anticipating this shed we wouldn’t have missed or forgotten a voicemail or phone call from them. There was also a note about their “trailer being stolen” which makes no sense on why that would be a problem, I would assume that a business like Tuff Shed would have multiple trailers and I believe they could have responded to any of our numerous voicemails and phone calls to explain that situation. Even Home Depot couldn’t get a hold of anyone at Tuff Shed today, so we have since canceled our order. We will take our business elsewhere I don’t understand how any respectable business can operate this way and still be regarded as “one of the best”. I understand the Covid-19 epidemic is still going on strong but that is no excuse for a business that is still open and functional to operate the way they have. If I could give 0 stars I would.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Review>The quality and build were great The crew that came showed up on time and put it up in a day. They did a fantastic job. Nathan Lammasson saw the whole job through from sale to finish. Now were they perfect ? No there was a mix up on the custom paint color I ordered which can happen. But what happened next shows what a company of high integrity they are at Tuff Shed. They sent a painter out to repaint the entire shed to correct their mistake. They owned up to it as well as fixed it and for that I give them 5 stars because I couldn't be happier with the final product. Great job guys thanks< /Review>< Rate>

Purchased on 10/28, explained we needed it ASAP before we purchased. Were told it would be installed in 3-4 weeks. We asked to be put on a short call list. Was installed on 12/18- late. Now here we are, its 1/9. I have a shed- that looks great. But can't be used because there are big holes were the windows should be (and we are told the parts on order). Seriously? Great product but delivery/installation/communication on a reasonable time line is a joke.< /Review>

Sales personal very knowledgeable and helpful in picking out your shed.
Install is a complete 180 fromn sales. To many installs not enough installers. Don't plan on having your shed installed on your scheduled day or completed in the same day. Commication after sale is sketchy.< /Text>

<Review>There's little shade from the sun, but other than that it's all you can ask for in a recycle center. Prices are always fair, it's clean, well staffed, every one is nice, they have a restroom! The parking has gotten better since they cleared the left side of the lot. If they throw a couple of shade trees in, it would be perfect.</Review>< Response>

The workers are always helpful and work hard. However, the older woman with the white hair that operates the cash register is very dishonest. She cheated me out of $40 for my copper/brass recycled materials. I don’t know if she did it because I’m a woman and she thought I wouldn’t notice, but I did. When I noticed the total was remarkably low, I asked for a receipt in which she rolled her eyes and proceeded to defend why the copper/brass portion was so low (even though I didn’t mention my concern in the first place). I’m not going to argue with an old lady over $40, but I will write a review to warn others of this recycling centers dishonest business practices.<//Text>

<review>Normally give 5 stars, but encountered a issue this morning.  We went and had 6 bins total.  3bins full of plastic, 1 bin cans, 1 bin misc plastic  and 1 bin glass bottles.  Signed receipt for $33.24.  Then cashier says she did it wrong she only did 2 bins of plastic and handed me new receipts for $22.23 for 3 bins of plastic.  She was explaining that 1st receipt was for 2 bins not 3 bins.  It made no sense to me that having more bins resulted in less cash than having less bins.  She said its correct dont worry they're very honest.  I've never had a problem till today.< /review>< Pics>

I've been going to this recycling center for years. Same family owned and operated. Extremely nice and friendly. I have often showed up right at closing hours and they never turn me away. Friendly workers even helped me separate my recyclables. I've never been disappointed.</Text>

<Text>Don’t go here!! They rip you off. I CALLED them PRIOR TO ME going there for their steel rates. They told you me 30 cents per lb then once I have all my steel weighted at the station they’re only giving me 2 cents per lb... Yes 2 cents!!!! Not even 30min from when I called them, then once they have weighted my steel they change their rate ALL OF A SUDDEN???! RIP OFF!!</Text>< resp>

< Review>
this is a good place  to come to get cash for ur cans...even though  they dont match ur coupon  they still give u a good price...lady at the window is very nice..i have been to many other places  but this one is right off the freeway.
in and out no lines...i spend about 10 minutes  or less depending  on what i bring and dont stand by the door they have a crazy chiwawa there  that likes to bark every time u stand by it...  :)<//Review>

< review>
So many people here complaining about it...
Anyway, they're there to help you if you help yourself. It's a free program and free job training. You meet people in similar walks of life and its in SD County, where there is a lot more Job Opportunities than other places.
The only reason for the four stars is because other students who don't take the program seriously can ruin it for others. Make friends, but stay away from the idiots.<//review>

<time>1461091083493<//time><review>San Diego Job Corps was a great experience for me. I only needed a couple more classes to graduate, so I was able to get my High School Diploma in a short amount of time. At the same time while earning my diploma, I took courses that provided real work experience. I was able to land a great job immediately after graduating.< /review>< gmap_id>

Helps you get your life in order,if you want to get out of your comfort zone and get the things you need in order to survive and you if you lack the social,academic and basic living skills. I highly recommend this program. And this is coming from someone that lived with their parents until 21  I'm almost 22 and getting everything that I need in a very short amount of time. Stop wasting time and get it together here!!!!!!!< /Review>

<Review>I had mostly ups and a few downs, but over all,  I would not trade the experience for anything! Made great friends and was able to grow as a person, both socially and intellectually. Served as President of the Honor Dorm with Robert Romero and Jimmy Minh Ho as my roommates and Ron was our RA (now he is running the place!) and he was always supportive and a great leader. If someone passes up the chance to experience SDJC, they don't know what they are missing!< /Review>< Pictures>

SDJC is AWESOME. I graduated with 2 trades and I was on the honor roll program etc.  If you want to feel sorry for yourself or be in a gang then you will never survive. You have to go with the program and that means RESPECT.Yes the dorms are not the best BUT guess what it is FREE. You also have to realize this was a MILITARY base one time.  You have to earn your privileges  to get off campus except on wknds. And yes they can and will even take that away. Everyone has to wear their badges everywhere they go. You eat when it is meal time and you are told when to go to bed.
I was in the honor roll dorm which was the nicer one and my dorm monitor was cool. We had dances on campus. The pay was not great when I went in 1990, and you even get a clothing allowance and free medical, dental and vision. weekends people went off  campus for the day, went to the beach, mall etc. they have a van that will drop you  off at the trolley. And if really needed $$$ you could go sell Plasma.  we were allowed stereos in our dorms. This is  a GOVT program and they have every right to kick you out if you do not follow the program rules</Text>

I attended SDJC and was SGA president, dorm presdient, student leader and on the CRB board. Got my HS DILPOMA AND GED, Got my CNA AND BAM Certicate. They feed you, give you money, a place to sleep and give you many amenities! The program will only work if you work for the program! 💯 Made friends and met mad people that I am still in touch with these days. 2000-2002 graduated!!<//Review>

I am live about 3 ours away from San Diego, originally. I went in 2012, and I loved it! But i ended up getting homesick, and the program i did, was very short. I didn't feel like i would have been equipped for the job. I loved living there because, it's, one, san diego. lol Two, its free and three, I met awesome people. I wish i had stayed for another trade, but I continued my studies in my hometown, and have joined the military. One day I will head back to san diego again. :) It is not a horrible school, you just have to stay away from drama and BS. Stay focused and get what you went there for. Its like a vacation if you aren't from that area lol seriously. I also recommend do everything and anything you can while you are there, because SD never gets boring.< /Text>

for some odd reason it seems like tha only good reviews are written by jst google users and that makes me think, is tha staff or people who work there are giving those reviews to give there selve a name to get more students ?? tha reviews seem more scripted more than anythhing just my opinion if anyone have word on this please repost or reply i really am interested in knowing others opinions on this  !!

I've been here for about a year now and I plan on leaving. The SIA Tech HS Program takes forever and I'd honestly just consider that if any one wants to go to a Job Corps that they'd go to a different one rather than SDJC</Review>

If you are planning a kitchen renovation or just to replace a broken appliance, please know that many manufacturers and brands have products that are backordered due to the pandemic. We made our appliances order in early October so that our appliances will arrive by the time our kitchen renovation started in November. Our sales guy Phillip Chavez was very helpful and knowledgeable with all the appliances in the showroom and he even price matched the appliances. He was also prompt in responding to my emails and questions regarding my appliance orders. When my Bosch wall combination oven did not arrive with the other orders at the end of October, Phillip was apologetic and answered all my inquiries patiently and politely. Now that I have finally received my wall oven (2021!!), Phillip made sure that I had the oven installed by Best Buy at the earliest available appointment date and time. I have to say it's rare to get such great customer service in any industry these days!< /text>

The staff is outstanding, they had the exact appliances we were looking for, and the whole visit from start to finish was within an hour. The prices are reasonable and they follow all the safety procedures for COVID-19. I highly recommend them!< /text>

< Review>
We were shopping for a new microwave/oven when we stopped at Pacific Sales in Irvine. We met Eric in sales and he advised us on the best product to consider. Eric was very knowledgeable and friendly. With Eric's help we ended up purchasing a new Oven/microwave and a new refrigerator. We could not have asked for a better deal, we purchase the oven/microwave and refrigerator for the price of a refrigerator. We have purchased from Pacific Sales before and received the same great customer service.< /Review>

We’ve been shopping for a bar fridge for a while and wanted to go to a full-service Pacific Sales instead of one inside Best Buy for selection and service. We were ready to buy but faced a sales person that was burned out, used profanity and was overall not helpful at all. He bad mouthed his employer and fellow employees. He finally found what we wanted to buy but said it would take 5 weeks. We ended up going to Renwes which was closer to our home, had the item for less and we are getting in 3 days.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Wow! I had a wonderful experience that really came as a surprise. I was expecting much, much less. I purchased a built-in refrigerator (Samsung), but this review is more about the sales person: Randy Acosta.
Randy was extremely professional and attentive from the very start! No hard sales, just honest comparisons. He really helped me to decide on the right refrigerator. Once I decided to make the purchase, Randy went WAY out of his way to make it happen on MY schedule.
Randy was fantastic and very professional. I know where I will be going for my next appliance needs!</review>< Pictures>

We have always received very good customer service from Pacific Sales. Over the past year and a half, my husband and I have purchased two dishwashers, two refrigerators a washing machine and hardware for two bathrooms.   We recommend the Irvine location to our friends whenever anyone mentions they need a new appliance.  With our last purchase, the washing machine, we did purchase the Premier Protection  Plan but have not needed to use this so I can't comment on their extended warranty program, yet. :)</Text>

We buy all of our appliances here. They carry great brands, and used to have an awesome clearance section. The clearance section has now been moved to another store. We have dealt with Rick in the past, he has treated us well.<//Text>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Dishonest. Will definitely never be buying from here again. They cancelled (PAID) items in my order without letting me know. They also sent (PAID) items in my name to other customers and never told me. When I confronted them about this, they just said that sometimes this happens. They even admitted to customers paying for items and never received them. They acted like it was a normal process.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcde8f431f26d9:0x955218a23ffe049c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've made two purchases here over the last 5 years and both went well. Nice show room, staff were helpful. Regular prices seem expensive, but specials & sale items are priced competitively.< /Text>

I worked with Juan the store manager and the customer service has been amazing.  After 6 weeks all of a sudden my refrigerator broke down...and they couldn't have been more helpful in fixing the issue promptly.  I will definitely go back to replace all the other appliances in my kitchen at Pacific Sales.<//review>

If I could rate it a zero, I would.  I would NOT recommend this store nor company to anyone!  No price is worth the stress and headache we have experienced with this company.

-The delivery workers scratched and dented our washer/drier unit and ripped our floors in two places.  They have denied our claim.

-I have made 40+ calls to multiple representatives and managers who do not return my call or transfer me to other people.  We purchased our machine in January and have been ignored, it is now July.

-At the Irvine store, 2-3 sales sales representatives quickly left me to assist other customers and never returned, I waited over an hour for assistance.<//Review>

ZERO STARS!

If they gave an award for the worst customer service, Pacific Sales would win hands down.

I ordered a range from PS.  Delivery was promised for the next week via their installers - West Coast Installers.  Three weeks later I still haven't received it, and they have no answers where it is, or when it will be delivered.

When I call customer service it often rings and rings with no answer.  I leave voice mail requests to be called back, but they never do.  On the rare occasion that I do get a human on the line they cannot answer any questions; they just put me on hold while they say they are going to "check out something".  Today for example I spent almost 25 minutes on the phone with a CSR (more than 20 minutes of that time on hold) and came away with absolutely no answers.  All he could do is "guarantee" a sales manager would call me back with answers.

So if you buy anything from this racket after reading my review, then you have only yourself to blame for the frustration, lost time, and lost cell phone minutes you'll spend trying to get Pacific Sales to live up to even a poor level of customer service.

Helpless Pacific Sales /Frigidaire/Prefered Service Plan Customer,

It's now more then a month and still we are without Dishwasher my invoice number is 4079795 for package deal that i purchased in Nov 2011 with five year extended warranty and we were in the assumption that Frigidaire is one of the best brand in market and Pacific Sales is the best shop to get the best deal. Salesperson pitched us about this brand plus extended warranty and now when we need it we are helpless as its more then a month now and it's not fixed yet.
Is this a life of a common man and a helpless consumer that once we pay money we are forgotten and every company say that they provide best customer service.
Anyone know the email id of senior management of these companies so i tell them it's useless to spend endless money in advertisement when u are not taking care of your existing customer.

God bless Pacific Sales/Frigidaire/Preferred Protection employees .< /Text>< GmapID>

Avoid this place at all cost!!!! Most staffs were just roaming around the store, yet no greetings, only weird stares at you. No one offered any help. Please save yourselves time and effort, shop somewhere else...< /review>

<review>Do not purchase items here if you are expecting them to help you. Not only do they lack basic customer service manners, they will not help you if one of their products fail but direct you to the manufacturer to sort through the warranty/replacement as they did when my 1 month old KWC faucet broke. Go elsewhere if you want a company to stand by the materials they sell.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Service was a little slow and the fan at check out was not too friendly, having  bad day, I guess. Would not prefer coming back the following day for a small item but all is in the warehouse.<//review>

Great customer service. Sales advocate Elizabeth was patient enough to transfer all my phone information from one phone to the other. I also got a brand new Samsung for only $50. Great deal!< /text>

I stopped going to this cricket store because the staff there had a lot of attitude and made it very difficult but recently I gave this store another shot today. I had to pay my mother’s phone bill and the girls, Tania and Jhovana, were  extremely helpful and nice in general. Best service from all the cricket stores I’ve gone to. Old staff is not there anymore and the new employees seems more properly trained and have more experience than the employees during my previous visit. Strongly recommend coming to this Cricket!< /Review>

Decided to give this cricket store a shot. Employees here go beyond than what is expected. I had a terrible experience in a previous store I had visited and Tania here in this store was wonderful to explain to me all the promotions they had. Brought two Verizon lines to Cricket got 2 Lg stylo 6 and she had no problem in giving me a discount. Tania was amazing in general I give her 5 stars only reason my review has 4 stars is because I don’t understand why their activation fees are so high.<//Text>

To your supervisor or manager;
Please hire staff with knowledge and professionals.
I am not satisfied with the service she provided me been the second time I came here to fix the problem.

I hope you read it and explain for your staff to not wast people time and learn before you serve people.

Thank you<//Text>

This particular store is the worst at Creekside I went in there just to look around and the new girl had me by a cover for my phone for my Samsung and when I got home to change it it was the wrong one then because I opened it it was non-returnable so she got me for a good $30 so no I don't think this is a good store for anybody rip off<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Thank you Tania you are very friendly and excellent customer service. She explained in detail the promotions and what was best for me in prices and services. I left the store super happy for the service of this girl, I will not go to another store because there is no service like hers. I saw when I went to the store that he treated all his customers very well and in the same way, they all left very happy. Once again, thank you very much, go with Tania.

Gracias Tania eres muy amable y excelente servicio al cliente. Ella me explico en detalle las promociones y lo que me convenia mas en precios y servicios. Me fui de la tienda super contento por el servicio de esta muchacha, no ire a otra tienda porque no hay servicio como el de ella.

(Translated by Google) Jhovana helped me and was very patient and kind. She answered all the questions I had and even helped me create an email. There is excellent customer service here and even her other coworker helped me, Tania, even though she was having lunch. They helped me get a free phone with an unlimited plan that also had free calls to Mexico.

Fantastic customer service, Kyle and Kenny were both extremely knowledgeable and preformed excellent customer service. Atmosphere is clean and inviting to the public. Product selection is vast and available. Would recommend shopping here at Vapor Connection, Camarillo, over any other cig. store in the local area.</Text>

<user_id>115970567309591206999< /user_id><Review>Always a great selection of e-liquids. Prices are a tad more than what you may be able to find at a cig shop but they're always worth the trip. If they don't have something, one of their surrounding locations likely will. They'll hold it for you too so you can guarantee you'll get it. If they don't have it in stock they can also order it for you.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

<Text>These guys are great. They're very friendly and I enjoy taking my time there and chatting while I shop. Downside is the devices used to sample the flavors are not like what I normally use (a kayfun) so they taste very different, and they are usually "gunked up" but I am not sure how they would fix this for samplers without it being very expensive on their part.< /Text><time>1543462258157</time><rating>4</rating>< resp>

<Review>Awesome customer service, and great pricing!! Very close to online pricing and eith the point system you end up getting things for free sometimes. Daily specials are usually on point and the juice selection is great!</Review>< pics>

They're friendly, and they have a decent selection, but I don't shop here unless I'm forced to. Every credit card I used here has been used for fraudulent buys within 4 weeks of being used. I don't use my credit cards often, so the pattern wasn't hard to spot. I can't say they're doing it deliberately, maybe their computer was hacked, or maybe it's just one person and everyone else is honest, but I don't buy here unless I have to, and then I use cash.<//text>

One of the few vape shops around, .not counting the little cigar/head shops where they know nothing of vaping products. Prices aren't the greatest on juice and my juice tends to be out of stock a lot. Good deals on their house juice though</Text>

this place is was better than beach vapes,
(not saying beach vapes is bad though!) the place is very clean and the guys that were working there when I walked in were very friendly and most importantly DID NOT have a bad aditude about people that walked in not knowing anything about vapes and juices. they were very happy to teach people about different mods and juices. good people here and good juices. I came in looking for some cuttwood sugar drizzle(they don't have any cuttwood though) and ended up leaving with some beard no.32 after they recommended trying it. their suggestions are spot on. great people and great shop!</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>BEST PIZZA EVER. it's warm, and doesn't have too much tomato sauce, and i love that! better than dominos, pizza hut and all those standard places. this is top notch pizza right here. and i wonder why everyone is complaining about the costumer service, because the lady who spoke with us on the phone was so nice. we got our pizza fast, and ready to go! I will be returning. And that's for sure.</Review>< Pictures>

Pretty damn good pizza. I like it! You get tired of the old Dominos taste. Jalapenos weren't as spicy and their dipping pizza sauce needs a little work. But the pizza has good flavor.</Text>

Personally I refer the taste of their pizza over Little Cesar's, however, their prices have gone up, so you may pay a little more now. Still, good place for quick ready to go pizza. No indoor nor outdoor dining available and no public bathroom. They just don't have the setup for it. This is def an in and out type of deal. Oh and no deliveries. But you will get a hot fresh pizza for around $8.00 average</Text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Love this local pizza joint.  Our Family loves to order from here because the service is great and so is the pizza. We usually go for the pepperoni because its the best and reheats great. It taste just as fresh 1-2 days later when put in the toaster oven. Highly recommended for the price. They have great deals in the mailers every once and a while. We just got free garlic bread sticks with our Hawaiian pizza.  Go... Eat... Repeat.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Very poor customer service. Poor attitudes and bad manners, aggressive and annoyed voice tones toward costumers. If their employees hate their jobs they should quit. I left, bought no pizza, never returning.</Text>

Place is good for the price. $6 Pepperoni or Cheese Pizza on the go. They have other selections of Mozzarella Sticks and family sized Pizzas as well. It's like Little Caesars and they both taste pretty good. If you need something fast and your craving for pizza, this place is a good stop for some.</text>

I now know why they call it Pronto Pizza.  In Spurseanish, Pronto means quickly.  Within minutes of calling in for a cheese pizza carryout, it was there waiting for me.  And the pizza of course, was hot and fresh.!!🙃😯😀<//review>

Most local pizzerias have their own specialty or Flair this place does not. It's very much a generic knock off of a chain Pizzeria like Domino's or Pizza Hut. The pizza isn't terrible I had a medium pizza with beef and bell pepper and it was fine but that's the problem because that's all I have to say about it.<//Text>

Basic stuff.  Nothing special.  But, not all that bad.  The pizza pie crust is of the spongy type.  So, if you can deal with that then this'll do.  Quick and cheap.<//text>

Can't say I had their pizza because they don't deliver,  and make you use Door Dash or Grub Hub for for delivery....Come on people,  deliver (like everyone else does) or people just go elsewhere like I did...</review>

No entry without a mask and gloves is allowed yet nobody is socially distancing. People jump lines. The lines are pretty long. Cleanliness and lighting can definitely be improved. Prices are good. A lot of ethnic products which are not sold in places like Safeway and TJ.<//text>

Won Kee supermarket is a super secret gem (for white people at least) of Chinatown. My mom in Idaho wanted nothing more than a bag of Li Hing Mui for her birthday so I waltzed over. It's a 5 minute walk from Lake Merritt BART.

Alas, I couldn't get in the first time because I didn't have rubber gloves or any small bills to buy some.  Chinatown knows how to battle Covid!

The next time i went with gloves I got SIX different varieties of salted plum. My mom thought I'd scoured all of Chinatown, but that was a one stop Goldmine.

I go there all the time nowadays. Great  fresh vegetable and fruit selection. Great Chinese spices. It's cheap!< /Text>

<review>Clean, requires facemask AND gloves for entry, good variety and values.  Street parking (meters.)  Easy access from i880; without the congestion of a few blocks away.< /review>< Pictures>

Fresh produces and most them are cheaper than other grocery market. Very limited parking space. If you don't mind walk for a block or two, street parking should be available near by.< /text>

It has a good selection of Asian produce and is one of the bigger grocery stores in Oakland Chinatown, but it has long lines. There is a line in the back of the grocery store that you can go to, instead of the two lines in the front.</review>

(Translated by Google) Accompanying my mother to buy food. One feeling is that the aunt and uncle get together, very messy. The types of vegetables and meat are quite complete, and sometimes the price is much cheaper. You can also buy some daily necessities like dishes and snacks. There is also a small roasted pork stall, but it is not recommended to buy it because the price is a bit pitted.

(Original)
陪我妈去买菜的。一个感觉就是大妈大爷扎堆，乱的很。菜肉种类都挺全的，价格有时候爱地摊的还便宜不少，里面还能买到一些像碗碟之类的生活用品和小零食之类的。还有一个很小烧腊档，不过不建议买，因为价格有点坑。<//Review>

My 3 year old son is very sensitive to loud noises and is terrified of large machinery but the dental assistants were very hands on and kind They primed him every step of the way explained what every machine and tool was used for and let him touch it so he would not be afraid. Although he didnt let himself get xrays done he was so happy to be there. All the staff was very flexible and accommodated everything for my sons needs. They even gifted him a few toys from the toy box! Great overall experience!< /Text>

Recently, I had a remarkable experience at the Salinas Valley Dental Clinic.

My dentist, Dr. Hashimoto, was not only so skilled at every step, but his “chair-side manner” made the whole experience seem like something other than a visit to the dentist.

There was no pain at every step:  the injection of lidocaine; drilling/preparing the surface; building/shaping what had been a tooth with a missing filling into something like an entirely new tooth.

Both of his assistants added to the “smooth operation” that was performed.

Easy to recommend the clinic and Dr. Hashimoto…</text>

<Review>SVDC is a clean well organized office. My habit is to get cleanings often enough to avoid having too much attention from the Dentist. I love my hygienist. Gentle and thorough is she. I appreciate the reminders and ease of scheduling too.</Review>< pictures>

Not only are they kind and caring, but they have continuously provided me with quality care. I went into their office with a long list of things that I wanted done, and they have been able to help me prioritize this list and get it completed in a timely and cost effective manner. Dr. Hashimoto in particular has been such a great help. With his patience and amazing listening skills, I always feel heard and valued. I actually enjoy going to the dentist now!<//review>< pictures>

By far the best dental clinic I have ever been my entire life.

Communication: clear, smooth and swift with electronic forms
Check-in: prompt and organized
Ambiance: very spa-like-calming, relaxing, neat and orderly
Dental-care team: Dr. Bui, Denise, Rhonda and the lady that took my x-ray (sorry I forgot your name) are all professional, pleasant and thorough in explaining the test performed, the results, steps and treatment plans/recommendations
Billing: transparent and detailed pertaining to the cost of procedures/treatments to be performed after the evaluation

I am pleased and happy with their service. I have known nobody from this clinic and have no bias towards/against this clinic-I’d say everything in this review is purely from experience and first-hand observation. Hence, I highly recommend SVDC.<//text>

<Text>They took care of three old fillings that needed replacing. Staff was very polite. Dentist was very professional and informative on what she was going to do on my teeth. She always asked how I was doing and asked if I wanted to watch a movie or listen to my favorite music while the procedure was occurring. I chose music. No pain at this office!  I’ve been coming here for over ten years and was always treated well.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>3rd time that I went in to the dentist office for some work was not a great experience (other 2 times were great with DR.Bui) due to the fact that after my treatment my jaw just hurts real bad to open my mouth, I did see a different doctor at the office(can’t remember her name but it was a female) , not my usual (dr.Bui) It has been a little over 1 month and my jaw (right side)is still hurting while I open my mouth (yawn, eat etc.) I feel they miss-aligned my jaw or something happened  during treatment but don’t wish this on any other patient of Salinas Valley Dental Care.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>I suffer from dental anxiety and it stops me from getting regular care. A few years ago, I had cracked a molar and needed a crown. It was over a major holiday and this office took me in as a new patient and fixed my problem. This office is very friendly and takes good care of me. I am very sensitive around my gum areas and the Dental Hygenist takes my issues very seriously. Cleanings are not a big deal anymore. I highly recommend this dental office.<//review>< user>

To my surprise, this place has the state-of-the-art technologies: digital film (which requires much less radiation dose than traditional films to acquire quality images), dental 3D scanner, and in-house lab to fabricate crowns. They were able to replace my 2 old crowns in about 2 hours in one visit. I was pleased and impressed by the efficient workflow.

Dr. M. Nguyen and the supporting staff were great. I hardly felt any pain or discomfort during the procedure.<//text>

I have nothing but good things to say about Salinas Valley Dental! The people are very friendly and genuine, the facility is gorgeous and has fancy, state of the art machinery (as far as I can tell). Just had a crown done. They create the crown while you wait. That boggles my mind. Very nice photos on the walls. Impressive place.<//Text>

<review>Staff is great, the dentist is nice and was great. I thought they took my insurance but turns out they only took one part, they did not accept the secondary, so it turned out to be way out of my financial budget. They wanted full payment upfront. I had to find another dentist. But great place, friendly, and very clean.<//review></record></dataset><record>

What a delightful experience. From making an appointment,  being checked in, x-rays and cleaning. The staff is very professional and kind. Having no dental insurance, I was introduced to the Member Plan, which was very affordable. I will definitely recommend Salinas Valley Dental to everyone!< /Review>

Salinas Valley Dental Care is Royalty. The staff, the facility, the atmosphere, and the sense of caring is simply unsurpassed by any other dental facility.  They set the bar by being a 10 star dental facility instead of 5. Proud to call them myself and my wife’s dental facility. Stay safe and warmest regards.<//text>

<Review>Completely changed my life. After my extractions I thought it would take forever to heal. Lucky for me my dentist had such a delicate touch that I healed up nice and quick. I highly recommend them, they never shamed me for not seeing a dentist for such a long time. They were patient with me and made me feel safe and comfortable.< /Review>< Time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have been a patient here for about 5 years and I will say hands down- every visit has been absolutely pleasant and professional!! For many years I would  experience some anxiety when visiting the dentist -but this team in every visit has always eased that anxiety away. The assistant that cared for me today (Rebecca) did such an amazing job, she answered my questions thoroughly and made sure I was comfortable the entire time.

If you or a loved one is looking for a new dental office where you will be cared for like family - give this team a call!<//review>< Pics>

Today the service i received was outstanding. The two ladies that took care of me were fantastic. Made sure that I could get my screening for my implant taken care of today rather than having to come back and got me an appointment to have the final portion of the implant done two days before I leave for vacation. Can not ask for more than that! Great job!<//Review>

Every single time I arrive for an appointment, the reception staff are incredibly responsive. The dental assistants and techs are so caring and professional, and the dentists are also professional, attentive, and personable. The bedside care of the dentists is unlike I have ever experienced. I am so happy my wife and I chose the Salinas Valley Dental Care professionals with our dental health.</review>

I failed to leave a review last March when I had a crown replaced & a tooth extracted.  Dr. Carolyn was so gentle and the rest of the staff was wonderful!  COVID protocol is still in place & I feel so safe there.  Today, I had a dental cleaning with hygenist Khylie & she was awesome!  I will definitely return!  Great experience, overall!</text>

I haven’t been to the dentist in may years and was hesitant as most people are. I had a very bad tooth ache and was honestly scared to go. From the moment I step in the lobby to the time I left THIS IS THE BEST DENTIST OFFICE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. Everyone is very pleasant and warm and took care of me like I was family. I am glad I picked them to go to. I will refer them to anyone I come across that needs a dentist. Thank you for the best treatment ever and now look forward to getting more work done. Thank you to the staff for the most amazing visit to a dentist office I have ever had.<//text>

They routinely add services without discussing with you and change your treatment plan without discussion. Make sure you ask what they are planning on doing, and what the fees are before you go in. Don’t just assume they will explain what your insurance does and does not cover. Don’t assume they will explain why they’re doing what their doing or ask for your consent before running up charges.<//review>< pics>

The Best Dentist office  I have found.    Truly professional.  The dental assistants have skillful, practiced hands and are very gentle.    Dental visits can entail some discomfort & pain.   They minimize the discomfort and no pain.  Don't go anywhere else-this is the one!</Text>

Dr. Chao and his staff are miracle worker's! I've been going to Salinas Valley Dental Care for many years. I've referred many friends and family. Due to Covid I as well as many people were unable to have dental work done and had to wait for proper medical clearance. So when I sat down in the exam chair the other day I was overwhelmed with tears of joy that Dr. Chao and his awesome team were still there. (Was a "pinch me" moment).They're like a part of my family.  Top notch! And I can smile again😁😁😁<//Review>

This is really a great dental office. From the moment you give them a call, to the check-in process, and when they actually treat you to the check-out process, everyone is always so courteous, friendly and kind. The one thing I wish was different would be if they could see new patients sooner, but they are definitely worth waiting for an appointment.< /Text>

The staff is professional, friendly, and very conscientious of procedures patients are concerned about. They explained everything they were doing. The consultation was very detailed. The plan was a collaborative process. Highly recommend Salinas Valley Dental Care.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>What an amazing experience.

The better customer service I've seen in most healthcare fields usually applies only so far as an air of professionalism, newer-than-average magazines in the waiting area, maintaining privacy policies, accuracy in billing (or at least rudimentary communication when that isn't the case), and generally having staff acknowledge at some point in the process that I am an actual human person. Patient-centered healthcare is a great buzz-word promised by consultants, conferences, and software salespeople. But especially in these days of Electronic Medical Records being completed in front of the patient, the focus of medical professionals is understandably compromised, shifted, or simply distracted by responsibilities like avoiding mistakes egregious enough as to warrant a lawsuit.

Usually.

And then there's Salinas Valley Dental Care. I have only rarely been COVID-quizzed and temperature-taken so kindly and politely. (My day-job takes me in and out of multiple medical facilities.) My preferred name was noted and used by the rest of the staff after I answered the gatekeeper's question about it. The tech handling my x-rays explained each part of the process clearly and engagingly. The D.D. overseeing my care made eye contact, asked a couple of times if there were any other needs or questions. And the tech (whose professional initials I cannot recall accurately) was personable enough that I wished aloud that we could continue our conversation (though without the part where my mouth was filled with dental equipment and gloved fingers) after the emergency repair work was done.

Someone with excellent management skills can provide professional services in a reasonably under-degrading manner, even in fields where a patient's anxieties tend to be higher than in other fields. (Dentistry is probably at the top of the list, though proctology and urology could easily make a run at the title with advancing age.) What does it take to turn a dental practice into a pleasant experience that I'm looking forward to repeating? Whatever or whomever it is that has established a truly patient-centered culture at Salinas Valley Dental Care, I pray that it/they stay there, but replicate their influence for the benefit of dental patients (and others) elsewhere.

Even the financial representative who brought me the estimate before I had to decide whether or not I wanted the repairs necessary...called me by my preferred name, explained the cost-breakdown, and took care of my payment while I was still in the chair.

Don't break a tooth to get in. But if you're looking for dental care that would actually motivate you to make and show up for your six-month checkups and cleanings...you'll find that here.< /Review>< Pictures>

Started going to Salinas Valley Dental care in September of last year. I made the best decision I could’ve made by picking them as my dentist after many years of not going to one. I’ve had different procedures done and all of them went great. The dentists and assistants do everything to make you feel as comfortable as possible. They listen to any concern you might have and work with you so that you feel relaxed and good. The moment I walked in that door the very first time everyone was so welcoming and until this day. From the receptionists up front to the dental assistants, hygienists, and Dentists. Everyone at SVDC are great people who truly care about its patients. I now look forward to going to the dentist whenever I need to go. I’m so thankful to SVDC for helping me improve my oral health and for continuing to do so. I definitely recommend them hands down as they are the best dental clinic in our area. You won’t regret choosing them as your dental care provider.<//review>

With being my first visit to this office.  All I can say is, I was very impressed with the staff, front desk personnel and the safety and comfort level that I felt. Especially during this time of COVID-19 that we are living in.  The facility was well cleaned and taken care of. There was no long boring wait time. The Dr's where very professional and took the time to explain to me all my options.  I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a dentist group.<//text>

This time they had a new system in place that worked really well with my life. I missed a few cleanings and they sent me a message last week and ask if I wanted to schedule it. I click on the link and it allowed me to pick a day from their calendar. Mind you this happened Saturday and I booked my appointment for the Monday coming up which was two day away. I loved it. It was so fast and convenient.</review>< user_id>

<Review>I have a severe phobia of Dentistry, after a traumatic experience I had as a child. That coupled with lack of dental care after ten years left me embarrassed about my mouth out of fear of being judged when I first walked in. When I first came in for a cleaning and consultation everyone was super kind and patient with me; my hygienist Veronica was great and we definitely bonded over similar interests.

Then when Dr. Madeline consulted me there was no judgement whatsoever, and she answered all my questions. Over the last 7 months I've probably been to the office at least once a month to get my procedures done, and never once did I feel mistreated or just a number.

I've been offered a blanket, asked if I wanted to watch something on Netflix or listen to Spotify in each room, and the best part is each room doesn't give off the "I'm at a dentist" vibe you feel like you're at a spa.

When it comes to payment for services I've always been given a detailed breakdown of the costs pertaining to each service, and always been able to work something out when it comes to being able to make my payments for the procedures.

Their staff are very well trained and I've always felt very safe with their handling of COVID-19 from entrance to leaving and they even call you a few days before to confirm your appointment (which helps since I'm a little forgetful.)

Safe to say that I'll probably be sticking with this practice for a very long time,  and after my next appointment hopefully not as many procedures needed in such a short timespan. Thank you Dr. Chao, Dr. Madeline, Becky, Vero, Kylee, Annika, Maria, and anyone else I might be missing!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

They listen to you and make you feel comfortable and calm. My anxiety is bad when I have to be in one spot for a long time. They actually listen to me and comfort me. Gave me time and told me everything will be ok. It was the best dentist visit I’ve ever had. Thank you to all the staff for taking care of my teeth and me.</Review>< Pictures>

Relocated back to Salinas after being away in Chicago for 19 years.  After much thought of returning to one of the many dentists that I previously  knew, I chose to go online and seek out fresh young talent.  I was totally impressed with this state-of-the-art dental practice.  No shortage of professionals, assistants and customer service.  Likewise, no surprises when the plan discussed with Dr. Bui was financially matched with my insurance coverage and various options were presented.  I am eager to experience my pending second visit. Very impressed to say the least!<//review>

< Review>
I have been going to this office since Dr. Chao took over the practice, and it has been a great decision. I've only had one procedure that wasn't just a cleaning, and it was much better that the "old days" of dentistry. I had to have a cavity fixed at the back of my mouth, and they had a framework the prop my mouth open. It doesn't sound good, but it really was a boon, as I didn't suffer from aching muscles afterwards from having to hold my mouth open. They also played music on headphones while they did the work. And, it was painless!

My teeth and gums have improved markedly since I started, due to their great care. I am glad to have Denise Fucci as my hygienist, as she is so friendly, gentle and accommodating with a patient that would otherwise be hard to drag into a dentist's office - and I would say that I look forward to visiting (well, sort of!).<//Review>

<review>I love this dentist SO much, they are so welcoming, friendly, professional, and very skilled. They truly value the comfort of the patient & do their very best to make sure we have a great visit. I’ve been offered warm wet-towels infused w/ lavender, asked if I wanted to watch something on Netflix or listen to Spotify on their Smart TVs in each room, given a detailed breakdown of the costs pertaining to each service, and have felt very safe with their handling of COVID-19. Additionally, they have people who specialize in whatever service getting done do the job, so you know you are in great hands. I recommend coming here to everyone. One of the professionals working on me today even fixed up a botched filling my previous dentist did at no additional charge! They also accept my insurance, so that’s a big plus.</review>< resp>

<Review>Best dentist office I’ve been to in a long time. Competitive pricing. Excellent  customer service. As for the facility itself well; it is very clean,  well built/designed high ceilings not claustrophobic whatsoever. Fresh coffee and ice cold bottles of water complimentary. All the employees seem professional, experienced and happy to be at work. I would definitely recommend this dentist office to anyone in the market.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808df889fd404657:0x36efe6707a2e5bc3</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great service! My daughter's and I had a pleasant visit. My little one is super scared of Dentist visits, however at her appointment with Salinas Valley Dental Care she did great. I believe the friendly staff and doctor played a key role in making this dentist appointment a positive experience.< /Review>

<Review>I've gone twice now. First time for a check up and second time for a clean up. Both times I've had a very pleasant experience, all staff members are very friendly. Another thing I liked is that they have the latest equipment in technology so all the jobs are quicker and more efficient to perform. Will be coming back here each dental clean up.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This dental office made me feel comfortable and welcomed as soon as i walked through the door. It was as if I knew these people already yet meeting them for the first time. The level of professionalism was very prestige and punctual. I didn't have a long wait... checking in was easy, and the reminders of your appointment were helpful. I haven't had a dental experience as pleasurable due to Dr. Chao and the staff at this remarkable dental office.<//Text>

Dental work is never a fun experience but at SVDC, they go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable and relaxed as possible.  Dr. Bui and her staff are professional and courteous and help you through every step of the process.</review>

<date>1595981672369< /date><rate>5< /rate><review>I had been feeling a bit nervous about a dental procedure I was needing since I had heard horror stories from friends regarding their personal experiences at OTHER places. Though Dr. Chao has always made me feel very comfortable and he and his staff have ALWAYS done a terrific job with other procedures I've had done, I was still a bit anxious.

I worried needlessly! He was FANTASTIC, as always. His staff received me as usual, with kindness and professionalism. When I told Dr. Chao I was feeling a bit nervous, he and his assistant took note and kept checking on me throughout the whole procedure. I actually got pretty comfortable as the procedure progressed. (The music was pretty relaxing and certainly was an added calming factor.) Thank you, Dr. Chao, to you AND your assistant, for taking my concerns into consideration and for doing such a great job!<//review>< Pics>

All the staff at Salinas Valley Dental care is kind and professional. The dental hygienist and dentists take the time to educate you on best practices and to talk you through your treatments. They’re also very accommodating. They have TVs and headphones to play a movie for you to put you more at ease if you’re nervous. Overall great care and would highly recommend!< /Text>

Prompt, compassionate and expert  describes the service I received.  I suspected a crown (that another dentist installed just five months ago) was loose, yet again.  Dr. Chao was able to see me the day I called.  He quickly and gently checked the crown, took it out, cleaned off the old glue and carefully returned it to its proper place within minutes.  All is good again.  Thanks Dr. Chao for a job well done!< /review>

I absolutely love this place.  The Doctors and staff and front desk teams are nothing short of amazing!
Friendly, knowledgable always greeting you with a smile and a warm hello.
I do not love going to the dentist but I do enjoy my visits here.  My hygienist, Cynthia S. Is super gentle and does a thorough and fantastic job.

Not only are the people awesome, but their hours are flexible for those who work bankers hours.
They have Saturday appointments!!!
Again, I cant say enough good things about this place.  I wished I had found this place sooner!!< /review>

My husband does his dental work here, and the staff and dentist are extremely helpful. The explained the cost of procedures and the procedures itself.  My husband is afraid of going to the dentist, but he enjoys how gentle the staff are with his treatments. They even offer their clients coffee and water in lobby. Awesome. I would highly recommend.</Text>

<Text>Dr. Bui my dentist, is wonderful. She makes you feel comfortable and takes the time to explain things. She is also a REAL person, no chip in her shoulder and very humble. Something so hard to find in doctors these days. Extremely knowledgeable, I'd recommend her to everyone... and, I do!

Additional comments are regarding their wonderful staff. Starting with Rebecca and Rhonda, I can't say enough about how wonderful they were with me. And, Rebecca's attention to detail on my teeth is as OCD as me. And, in my book, that's a really good thing.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Salinas Valley Dental Care so far has been the best dental experience Ive had compared to several other places I have gone to before. The office is super clean and organized, Staff is really friendly and helpful seem happy going.
While I was getting a cleaning the hygienist was really gentle as I had sore gums and I didn't feel a thing. I would definitely recommend this dentist to any one and everyone.< /Text>

I went on a Saturday without an appointment, I had been in pain caused by a wisdom tooth. I had gone to another place 2 days prior and I was told I needed a bone graft once the tooth came out... needless to say they were changing me an arm and leg!!!! I decided to get a second opinion and went to Salinas Valley Dental care, boy was I glad! Everyone is soooooo nice. From the girls at the front to the doctors! I mean everyone ! I ended up not needing the bone graft, payed less than a third of what the other place was charging me AND was in and out the same day!

I have avoided the dentist for 15 years, suggest not doing this.  The staff is great! The Dr.'s are amazing! Would highly recommend this office to anyone in search of a new dental office.</Text>

They have the best updated equipment.  Dr. Chao and Dr. Madeline are very gentle. You hardly feel the needle/injection.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  And very thorough. I am lucky to have all of them. The office is very updated.   I think I will stop now, I do more want too many people coming haha and making them too busy.<//review>

<text>Just had fillings completed by Dr. Bui and her assistant Kayla. Both were wonderful. Very professional. I was sitted right away and Dr Bui came in right away. Everything was explained to me and both Dr. Bui and Kayla checked in on me to make sure I was comfortable. The fillings look and feel great! In and out in a hour which I can appreciate!</text>< Pics>

They are the best. I did not go to the dentist from 18-26 years because I feared the dentist. Since I found them, they have been so caring and helpful. I had a root canal with local numbing and no pain. They even take the courtesy to call afterwords to check on how your feeling. I recommended them to all my family and friends.<//review>

< Review>
Salinas Valley Dental Care (SVDC) feels like a spa, but is a top notch dental care center. I had a deep-cleaning and a crown done recently here. The care was gentle and attentive and I am very happy with the results and follow-up.

The staff are incredibly professional and kind as well. The two dentists and two hygenists I have interacted with are young, top notch trained professionals. If SVDC is representative of the future of dental care in the U.S., then I think we are all in great hands.

Technologically, they are a step ahead, which perhaps lends to their efficiency. Each staff member has an ear piece and can communicate through a small mic with others around the office. This speeds up care and my hygenist noted that it keeps her in the loop about what is going on around the office and what she needs to attend to and when. It also enables the doctors to check in quickly beause they know which patients are in need of attention and when.

When I had my crown done, they put on Netflix for me and let me choose something I would enjoy watching while they worked. My dentist (Dr. Bui) didn't mind at all when I laughed while watching a comedy special--somewhat moving my mouth. I know this made her job a bit harder, but it didn't phase her one bit.

I can't speak to the dental technology since I am not knowledgeable in this area, but they did have both what seemed to be a new and advanced 180 degree X-ray machine and few hand held X-ray machines to localize the X-rays to teeth of interest. I don't know if this is standard (I haven't been to the dentist in a while, unfortunately), but they clearly had the tools to make effictive and efficient assessments at regular intervals throughout the treatment process.

My insurance (Delta Dental) also was in-network. My wife was really unhappy when she found out her dental insurance through her work was out of network because she really wanted to have SVDC as her clinic to provide dental care. She wanted to come to SVDC.

Similarly, I think this is the first time I have looked forward to going to the dentist too.

Thanks to you all at SVDC-keep up the awesome care!<//Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Thank you SVDC; I appreciate getting such a quick response to my dental needs. I called as a new patient Friday night, met with Dr. Bui at 10:30 Saturday morning and Dr. Makan extracted my tooth and performed a bone graft at 2:30. I called their on-call doctor Sunday night when I was concerned with some swelling and a spike in pain, but Dr. Chao set me at ease asking me to come in first thing Monday morning. Thankfully after using an ice pack Sunday night I woke up this morning feeling great. I am very impressed by their office's quick, streamlined, personal help.</Text>< Rating>

If you have fear of the dentist look no further. Dr. Chao is the most gentle, compassionate dentist I have ever met.  His personality is calming and if you are uncomfortable he can put you to sleep during treatment.  This is a truly exceptional person and Salinas is lucky to have him!</review>

<Review>My entire family has been treating with Dr. Chao ever since he took over Dr. Stein’s practice (our previous dentist). Dr. Chao is very innovative and skilled, as are the other dentists in his office. I’ve had the opportunity to treat with some of the other dentists in his office and found them to be competent and knowledgeable as well. His new location has state of the art equipment and facilities. He is also certified in medical sleep medicine. My family and I would highly recommend Salinas Valley Dental.</Review>< time>

Dr. Chao and his assistant Judith work great together as a team. I came in today to get a chipped tooth fixed and the appointment went very well. Judith made sure I was comfortable in the chair and even offered me a blanket and headphones. Dr. Chao explained what he was doing throughout the procedure and got it all done with little to no pain. Great experience! Would definitely recommend this office to my friends and family.<//Text>

<Text>Really awesome Dental place and Office with a lot of spacing to go to when I got my checkup and cleaning for my teeth with the workers and Dr. Chao. And also a good place to get my oral surgery to get my wisdom teeth removed by oral surgeons. I'd highly recommend going to this new awesome and cool spacing of the new dental place.</Text>< pics>

<text>Chao Dental Care is great!  Dr. Chao and his staff are friendly and completely committed to a positive experience at his office.  I needed a crown to fix a chipped tooth, a procedure that can be unpleasant for the patient.  Dr. Chao was committed to my comfort, and even offered noise canceling headphones with my choice of music while going through the procedure.  No pain at all, and it was completed much more quickly than I had anticipated.  I will definitely return to see Dr. Chao.< /text>< Pictures>

<user>118269755584980498274<//user><resp>None< /resp><Text>Dr. Chao and staff are amazing!  The facilities are clean, the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, and they will do their best to ensure you have great dental health.

What really sets the doctors apart from the rest, though, is how they treat their staff and hygenists.  Instead of acting above them, the doctors make sure that the staff are as equally informed as the patients are, creating an extensively respectful, high quality working environment that definitely shows with the demeanor of the staff.  Their treatment of the staff assuredly goes a long way towards patient satisfaction.

I would not hesitate to provide a recommendation to Dr. Chao if asked.  We are extremely glad to find a dentist in the Salinas area!<//Text><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

Salinas Valley Dental is the best dentist office in the world hands down! I’ve seen both Dr. Bui and Dr. Chao and they are friendly, gental, caring and amazing at what they do! I’ve got  cavities filled, a root canal, a crown, and an extraction done there and every time I’ve been the staff has been friendly and very accommodating. The facility is very beautiful and exceptionally clean with top-of-the-line technology. I was very impressed when I got my crown that they were able to do it right there on the spot and I didn’t have to get a temporary or come back for another appointment. They definitely make going to the dentist the best experience you will ever have! 💜💙💜</text>

< Review>
If you're like me, going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do, until I found  Salinas Valley Dental Care.  First, let me say I value reviews as it's helped me make wise decisions pertaining to various purchases.
However, when it comes to Dentist and Doctors, I truly believe in writing an honest review, because it pertains to our health and well-being.

Dr. Chow has been my Dentist for a few years now and I cannot say enough about his professionalism, expertise, and experience, in reassuring me about my dental concerns. They have the latest equipment in dental procedures, such as, no more temporary teeth and then having to wait for the permanent  one.  I just waited about 30 minutes and my permanent tooth was attached. Their dental equipment is top of the line and Dr. Chow is always researching and purchasing the next best thing on the market!!  There are many professional dentist to choose from, but I guarantee you, Dr. Chow and his staff are the #1 choice in my book. Not only are they experts, but they're gentle, kind, considerate and always making sure I'm comfortable. Whats really special is they call you after your procedure to make sure you're doing well.  While I'm at it, I also want to commend his staff, Maria, Rebecca, Julie, Alicia,  Myumi and Sara. It takes a TEAM to provide outstanding care!!!! Salinas Valley has all of the above!!! JFY: Yes I'm really a patient, 67 yrs. young with a bright smile:))</Review>

<review>DR. Chao and his professional team have changed my life. The quality of care and patient communication is amazing. I had not seen a dentist since 2009, so getting back into a dental routine was a bit daunting, but the Chao Dental Care team made all the worries go away. after two crowns and a root canal, with Dr. Chao and his team, i can tell you there is not many finer dentists out there.

This last visit, i can't even remember as there was no pain or discomfort with the root and canal procedures. In fact he has out fitted his office with the latest dental technology, and the device he used today to numb my tooth was amazing.  instead of numbing my whole mouth, or side of my mouth, he numbed only the tooth he was working  on. No pain and still lots of gain.  So if you are worried about seeing dentist out of fear of the pain, Dr. Chao will definitely send you home with a great smile.

<text>I have been under the dental care of Dr. Stein for years and when he retired, I didn’t know what I was going to do. He was so caring and gentle and I knew it would be hard to replace his skill and compassion. I am happy to say I was so wrong!  Dr. Chao and his entire team are amazing!  Hygentist Jane always primes my gums with some numbing gel, due to my very sensitive teeth and it makes my cleaning so much more pleasant. This morning I spent some time in the chair under the outstanding care of Dr. Bui and her assistant Maria. I broke a tooth yesterday, and on my birthday today,  I was delighted to receive a custom crown for my tooth. I would have liked a real bedazzled golden one for my head, but a crown is a crown. Dr. Bui was so competent, sweet, and gentle from the get go.  Maria had so much empathy and made me feel at ease though out the whole process. The crown was designed and created in one visit and I don’t have to come back to have it cemented in.  I am so pleased with my care and I would higher recommend this dental office.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Salinas valley dental care has an amazing staff! I always leave satisfied thanks to my hygentist Ashleigh shes awsome! Most importantly I LOVE the fact that you dont have to wait long like in other places, If I have an appoinment Ill be called no more than 15 past my appoinment time! Keep on doing what you are doing Dr. Chao amd staff!!</Text>
