The sandwiches were made to perfection. We asked for it slightly extra toasted and it was spot on.  We enjoyed the dinner we picked up and will be back to this location.

<review>Today had a pickup for ubereats at this location during the lunch rush. The place was understaffed and swamped with customers for a Superbowl Sunday. The young lady working there was AMAZING! She was handling the rush with what seemed like no help but got things done and was getting people moving. I wish I would've got her name so I can let subway know; I'm still going to try.<//review>< pics>

Awesome place to eat. I love their new bread with the jalapeno peppers already made in it I can eat it with any sandwich. The prices are great weather you are on a budget or not. One more plus to add to this business the stay open 24-7. So you never have to worry about being hungry if u work overnight.</text>

Another location refusing to honor the Uber Pro Partnership agreement while listing themselves as a Pro Partner on the Uber Driver app. Total bait and switch to get you into the store just so they can try to make a cash sale still. Another report to Subway corporate for violations of the Subway/Uber partnership will be on its way.</Review>

<review>The one off of 70th street and freeway has a very pleasant and accommodating staff. Not the busiest so it may take a little longer or near closing some might not be readily available but for the money. I like them.< /review><username>richard simon<//username>< Gmap_id>

Today is Saturday and sandwich of the week was a meatball sub... Which I ordered.  They were out of meatballs.  Then,I ordered a chicken pesto grilled.  Out of that.  After more consideration, I got the American club.however, the "sandwich artist"made the arong sandwich and had to start over.

Meanwhile, no apologies or any kind of symptahetic attitude from the two young women there.  We always seem to have poor experiences at this particular Subway.  We will not be back</Review>

<Review>This is a good location, it's open 24hrs, and the sandwiches are fresh. This location is open twenty four hours a day. They have some really good juice that is concentrate free, fructose corn syrup free, and they now have a coke freestyle machine so you get like over 80 flavor options.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80d956d2b5b12beb:0x4002a1a6b4fe16f0</Gmap_id>< pictures>

The guy making the subs ,  told me to wait after the first sub ,  then he went outside  to get something (that he put in his hand and close his fist) , so my granddaughter was thirsty  I told get a cup and get water.  Then the guy working  came in and made my 2nd sub , then told me if I was going to pay for a drink. I informed him it was water but he said the not the cup for water,  so I told him give a cup for water for my granddaughter  he said there is no cups for water.  That i had to pay for a drink</review>

Manager was rude, and had a very unperfessional attitude!! I asked for extra toppings for my husband's  veggie sandwich, and she acted as if it was a problem, or she was paying for the items.  Customer service is just not the same any longer these days.</review>

I was hoping to run in and grab a quick sandwich. Being 5th in line I wasn't expecting it to take 17 + minutes. I'll reevaluate stopping here in the future, especially at lunch. I used most of my lunch waiting.<//review>

Horrible customer service! The young lady who helped me was so rude! Asked me what i wanted and tha proceeded to cut me off each time I spoke, she never smiled and just looked unapproachable. Word of advise " If you don't like people, don't work customer service ". 8/24/18 7:20 pm< /review>

Some delicious sandwiches, though, a bit expensive. Usually there are many nice people working at this particular Subway, and rarely, there'll be some awkward servers serving the sandwiches incorrectly. Otherwise, this is quite the excellent place to get sandwiches<//Review>

Wait in line for 20 minutes and they will either not have the ingredients for your sandwich, overcharged you, or just f*** up the entire sandwich in general.

Had a friendly person at the counter, but then they left a sandwich out of my bag!! Solution come back for a new sandwich or come for a refund. Are they serious?! I guess we'll play paper-rock-scissors to see who doesn't eat today.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The VRD is not satisfied with the treatment I had today, they reluctantly attended to me and it is not good that things open up to you as if they did not want to attend. in the morning if there is good attention and good treatment there is no problem with the staff in the morning it would only be to improve their person in the afternoon it is everything and happy afternoon

(Original)
La vrd no quede comforme con el trato que tuve el dia de hoy me atendieron de mala gana y no esta bien que te abienten las cosas como si no quisieran atender. en las mañanas si hay buena atencion y buen trato no hay nigun problema con el personal de en la mañana solo seria mejorar su personalen la tarde  es todo y feliz tarde<//text><resp>None</resp></record>

1st off - The ladies work as slow as snails whether you are on lunch or not. 2nd - The handmade quesadilla is the size of a long thin taco with hardly any cheese. 3rd- The Nacho fries with meat are skimpy. Not much cheese and not much meat. Plus they had an ugly after taste from being fried in oil thats been used to fry other food. And the fries were not cooked fresh but rather microwaved!!!!! Just dont go and if you do - that's on YOU!!!!!!
Mind you, before this experience  I had given this place 5 stars.< /review>

Hey...everybody I would like to encourage you to support our local business during this pandemic times.I DO  highly recommend DONA MARTA'S KITCHEN RESTAURANT because she has that special SAZON which reminds me to my grandmother. There you can eat a variety  of ANTOJITOS MEXICANOS....of course mine is ENCHILADAS ROJAS DE SALSA GUAJILLO....<//Text>

This place is trash. Rude staff. If you want some fresh food, check out the mariscos truck called "mariscos el bigoton" its like right around the block. They have the best tostadas.< /text>

We got in in sections plus some of my order wasn't given and the lady at the window is flirting and having a full conversation about her personal life while the other lady in the back trying to do everything on her own. When asked where the rest of the food Was? She said that was it. No lady maybe of you weren't busy talking to that man you would of gotten our order correctly. Too top it off the food wasn't great either...except the pepsi that taste really good. Not recommending anyone.< /Review>< pictures>

A poor lady was counting change, and asking how much tortillas cost. She was completely ignored. A customer tried to buy food for her, and that person was REFUSED service because the employee said they were buying it for this lady. The poor lady was outside crying, when the person gave her money to buy food from another place. This place is disgraceful.< /text>< Pics>

Great food! I love the handmade quesadilla, the cemitas are the best in town and the taco arabe great taste very original from the State of Puebla.  Carnitas are made daily they taste great I heard they put over 18 ingredients and spices.<//text>

This place is horrible. Cold food, not fresh, and canned. I don't know how this place even has a 4.2 rating??!! Wanted to order a cemita but they didn't have any. Ordered some huaraches and some asada fries. The food was rather cold. These huaraches had canned beans!!! Like common you can't cook some beans??!!! The asada fries were not good as well. They microwaved them!!!! There's this really thin layer of cheese that they had to microwave! Why did they microwave them? Cause the fries weren't freshly fried and the meat wasn't freshly cooked either! The carne asada was dry and pretty flavorless. If I could I wouldn't even give this place a single star. Oh and my mom tried one of their handmade quesadillas and it wasn't good either, it even made her sick. We've had way better quesadillas than that.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The first time I go to eat at this place and the truth is I will not return. I bought a cemita and when I took the first bite it tasted strange and when I opened it I got the smell of rancid oil. I couldn't even eat it because of the smell and taste of rancid oil.

La primera vez llendo a comer a este lugar y y la mera verdad no vuelvo. Yo compre una cemita y cuando le di la primera mordida me supo raro y al abrirla me llego el olor a aceite rancio. Ni lo que me costo ni siquiera me la pude comer por el olor y el sabor a aciete rancio.</review>< Time>

Really nice service. Gyoza was underfried 😕. Spicy Salmon roll was nice, but not spicy. Mexican roll was awesome. Sammy roll was good. If only the Gyoza was cooked thoroughly. 🤔< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Another update: my husband loved the roll I got and wants to order again. So I rexamined the photos of the menu and it indeed does say togo items do not include SALAD. Nothing about no soup. Which I called specifically about yesterday. So I got 1) lied to on the phone by the girl 2) ripped off on my soup, which I wanted enough to callback. I will be calling back and speaking to a manager about my f#@$ing soup cause I'm that petty right now. If you don't want to do your job correctly, get a new one instead of deliberately lying to people.

Update: finally got through after the phone rang and rang and rang.. and rang and rang and rang. For any future customers, apparently somewhere on their menu it says soup and side salad not included - at least that's what the girl on the phone said.

Will be trying a different venue next time cause that's really lame. Especially if you purchase a $15 roll to go.

So the menu online says all rolls come with salad and miso soup, when my husband showed up for pickup all they handed him was a roll. When he asked for the rest of it they gave him just a salad (I ordered a seaweed salad as well and it's not worth it tbh unless you want an actual salad and a small corner of seaweed salad).
Really disappointed as I love miso soup. One would think if salad and miso soup comes standard with rolls it wouldn't be so easy to forget. Been trying to call back and phone is just a busy signal.
Really annoying.<//text>< Pictures>

Best place for some sushi and at a good price!!! Personal favorites are the baked salmon, Sammy roll, and baked lobster. Every roll comes with a free miso soup or salad :)<//Text>

Our entire family loves the food here but the waitress was horrible! It’s definitely the kids favorite. Unfortunately she (older Asian lady) was really rude and completely ignored my grandson when he ordered. Not just that, but she always seems upset or bothered. She must be the owner because she’s been here for a while. After all the times we’ve come, and heard others complain,  she is still here!!! Don’t want to give up on this place but won’t tolerate the attitude. I have never written a review before. I just felt the need to do it, hoping that she or the owners read this and make some changes.< /Text>

Food was good, sushi was decent. Not bad for a little place. With an order of a roll you get a miso soup and salad not for take out. Pricing is decent. I ordered the crunchy tempura roll and spicy tuna tiger roll.</Text>

Horrible. I used to come here a few years ago and it was better. Now the food is rancid and definitely not fresh and the service is very bad. The older Japanese lady obviously did not want to be there and wasn't afraid to have attitude towards customers. Place has gone downhill. Never coming back.< /review>

The older Japanese lady that works there is incompetent. I called in an order and she wrote it down wrong then when I tried to call back to add to my order she didnt hang up the phone. It was off the hook! Defeats the purpose of calling in! My family and I won't be going there again.< /Review>

<text>First time trying this spot and I was very pleased. The service was pleasant and quick. I had the sushi 10 piece, with miso soup. Fresh and large portions, as one always hopes for. They don't appear fancy but serve up good food. Not bad for strip mall dining at all.<//text>< Pictures>

HAD A NOT SO PLEASANT EXPERIENCE WITH A YOUNG GIRL WHO "WORKS" THERE BUT LOVES HER CELL PHONE A LITTLE TOO MUCH. ALSO, SHE COPED AN ATTITUDE WITH ME BECAUSE I ASKED HER FOR ANOTHER TO GO BOX (INITIALLY ASKED FOR 2 BUT HER CELL WAS MORE IMPORTANT. I ASKED FOR THE 2ND BOX WHEN SHE ONLY ARRIVED WITH 1 AND SHE ROLLED HER EYES AT ME.)</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

We have been going there for years now. Never a disappointment. We love the food. Everyone has always been very nice. They have great prices. Especially for what they serve. We love it. Plan on going there later today for my Udon. My absolute favorite place to get it.</Review>

We love this place. Every time we are in the area we make sure we come get our sushi fix 🍱🍱. The price is right $$$, and the portions are good size. We highly recommend coming here.

Sushi here does not taste fresh and the portions are tiny. They give you mostly rice hardly any fish.< /text>

Service was good.  But limited roll selections.  The rollls had way too much rice.  They were filled to look big but way too much rice.   Bland tasting.   Nothing spectacular<//Review>

Great flavors. Small spot, not the comfy-est place to eat in, but we were pleased with everything we ordered. We got the "Honeymoon" roll off the special menu- wow amazing sushi roll.< /text>

The lady that was work was rude. Every time we ask for some she had an attitude. So I didn’t leave a tip and actually ran after me and sister in law ask why we didn’t leave a tip when we told she start yelling at us. Never going back<//review>

I am a close to a regular at this place. Today I was not to satisfied with my sushi roll. The rice that wraps around the roll was smooshy, I didn't like that. But still, it was okay. Hope it doesn't happen again.<//Review>

<review>Not sure what has been happening the last couple of months but there has clearly been a drastic change in management. I frequent here many times a month for my office! In my last 5 visits, I've called ahead, given an estimated time for pickup and get there to find out the order is never ready. Mind you, I've always given an extra 10-15 minutes before picking up to be safe. 3 times I had to wait a minimum of 20 minutes after already waiting 15 minutes from the time i placed my order. During my visits I have witnessed the cook yelling at the cashier for not taking the order correctly and not knowing who's order is who's during a busy time. Cashier was frustrated, chef was frustrated and we all (about 5 of us) waiting to get our order were frustrated.  Today was the last straw. I called ahead for 1 bowl, was told 10 minutes, I waited 15 minutes (based on my past experience), get there and they have absolutely no record of my order. Again, chef being very short with both cashiers. Yep, two of them.  (probably as frustrated as I was). As I told them I could not wait, I turn around to meet the faces of 2 other customers who have been waiting 20 minutes and more frustrated than I. I refuse to support them until they make some changes and actually make training all the new faces a priority. Once is an accident, twice maybe a fluke but three or more is simply neglect. Everytime I go in there, there is always a new face and clearly always in training mode that isn't going very well. Hope you can make a positive change and take my review with a grain of salt.<//review>< Pics>

<review>The portions here versus the Flame Broiler next to Best Buy on Nordhoff is night and day.  This is a joke.  For the price, to not even have a "regular bowl" filled is egregious.  Would be laughable but this involved money.  I usually go to the one on Nordhoff, and I will probably not come back to this one.</review>< time>

< review>
Been going here nearly every weekday in the afternoon since late March 2019 due to strictly monitoring my caloric intake. Food is good and consistent; staff is nice, courteous, and professional. Water is filtered and cold, even without ice. Patrons here can sometimes be messy (like most places), but staff keeps things clean. I've been served by the owner a few times, who is kind and jovial.

As to what I order, I religiously order 1 chicken & veggie bowl with brown rice and no green onions. I top it with hot sauce, triple hot sauce, jalapenos, and black pepper. (Yes, I like it hot, even as tears start coming out out.) Staff knows me by sight now and knows what I'll be ordering.

I hate avocado, but they serve it here and people order it frequently enough so I guess it's good. I've also had the beef bowl, the half & half, and plate-size portions before. All are good; the orange slice and salad on the plate are simple but surprisingly refreshing, which is kinda' Flame Broiler in a nutshell.

This place is my peaceful little lunch getaway from work and generally the highlight of my work day. Parking in the plaza is pretty bad but I walk here for lunch anyway!

Protip: The restroom code is printed out on your receipt, but I'm assuming no one notices that. Staff will readily give the code to customers when asked anyway.<//review>

Panda, Waba, Yoshinoya, or San Sai are better options in the area.< /text>< resp>

The Hispanic woman with the pierced lip is horrible. First time she "helped" me I had to ask if she worked there because she was in the front watching TV. Then she was very unprofessional and ended up giving us the wrong order which I didn't discover til I got home. Second trip - she couldn't get the order right and was making excuses. This isn't rocket science. Then she tells me I ordered it wrong. If she is still there IF I go back that's it, I'm done with this location. I left there so angry and frustrated. And finally, I was told Melinda the manager is "never hardly here" so I can't even contact her. Add to that, the chicken was so chewy it was inedible.

Follow up: I wrote to FB corporate and they were very accommodating in following up with the store manager on this issue.<//Review><time>1553638034769<//time><userid>117308284226612217799<//userid><Response>None</Response></record>

Why was my online order which said was ready to pick up, just made as i show up. Everyone else who came in got their food before me so it doesnt make sense to order online if its not ready and takes more time. HEADS UP DONT ORDER ONLINE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT 20 MINUTES<//Review>

My experience here was great. I was able to get a quote online & it was honored start to finish once I brought my car in. Not only that, I was able to get my particular repair done in a reasonable time(Had old serpentine belts swapped out on my Honda today)& their parts are covered by warranty.
The employees I dealt with personally were very patient & understanding which during a pandemic are extra great qualities to have. You've probably been mailed their coupons which are also honored if you present them for your repair. Have a few other repairs needed for my car & as of now Hal's is where I intend to take my car for them once I have more money.</text>

Happy to have gotten a free oil change from a post card mail promotion with a discover-by-scraping-off silver covering deal.

It is very close to my home -- 3 blocks or so -- so this will probably become my standard when they can meet the price on various other promotions I get

<review>My wife and I have used Hal's Auto Care for close to 30 years anytime we've needed air conditioning repair on one of our vehicles.  We have never been disappointed in the service.  They've always been professional and taken care of any problems we've had rapidly returning our vehicles in the same day.  We don't think looking for anyplace else to take our troubled vehicles because we know we'll be taken care of quickly and professionally and reasonable prices.

< Review>
Hal's Auto Care went above and beyond for me recently.  I had multiple service maintenance items performed on my Honda Accord recently.  However, when picking up my car, there was a serious problem.  The engine sounded horrible.  They offered a loaner vehicle and took it back in the shop.  They spent the next few days troubleshooting what might have gone wrong.  Methodically, they began to rule out their work as they analyzed the car.  They even called my previous Honda dealer where I got my car serviced to try to identify the problem.  After about a week they found the problem to be the timing belt had jumped 5 teeth on the rea cam.  It turned out to be a failed hydraulic tensioner.  The thing is, they didn't do any work on that or anything related so it was unlikely to be due to their fault.  But because it happened on their lot they took ownership of the issue.  They ended up fixing it and working out a very reasonable deal.  They also did not charge me for all the diagnosis time for troubleshooting.  This was a very unfortunate coincidence that they took ownership of and it really proved how great they are.  Their team is humble and trust worthy.  I highly recommend them.</Review>

Always the best repair shop.  They custom shop the best parts for the job.  Your insurance co. gives them an estimate, and they do what they can to make it an easy job for all.<//text>

I have used Hal's for various repairs to my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The experience has always been positive.  I'm cheap, but want quality.  So even though I know I'm probably going to  take my car to Hal's, I will call around and get price quotes.  It NEVER fails, they are always the most reasonably priced and always the most honest.  I appreciate honesty very much especially being a woman who knows nothing about cars, I've never felt like they were taking advantage of me....quite the opposite really.< /Text>

<text>Initially I brought one vehicle in for A/C work.  They undercut the dealership by several hundred $$, plus said it didn't really need what they had said it did.  Since then have brought all my cars here.  Everything the other reviewers have said is true - fair, good prices, great service and very knowledgeable repairs.  This is the only shop I've ever been where they will have a tech ride along and have me describe what I'm experiencing before taking shots at what the problem might be.  I would recommend this shop to anyone!<//text>< rating>

I thought that with Toyotas, I would always have to go to the dealer for service, but I found Mike @ Hal's is trained and experienced on all vehicles. And he charges less than the dealers. My car has been there for an oil change and again for the 60,000 mile service and my husband's for the 90,000 mile service. Mike is knowledgeable, honest and he stands behind his work. As a bonus, his waiting room has great coffee and a larger-than-life TV.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I wanted a cruise control installed on my '05 Toyota Tacoma.  Every place I called said it could not be done.  When I called Hal's they were more than assuring about the installation.

When I brought it in, the technician not only did a great job of installing the unit, but he brought me to his work area to ask me about the ideal location.

The only thing I'd have a reservation about was that they told me it would take about 2 hours and it took about 1.25 hours and they still charged me for two hours of work.  However, as even the dealership said no one could do it and Hal's did, I didn't complain.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I first learned about Hal's Auto Care many years ago when a car care company I had been dealing with slipped and told me Hal's was going to do the a/c work that they had told me would cost over $900. I called Hal's, explained what needed to be done and asked what it would cost. I was told "no more than $300." Indeed, when the work was done at Hal's, my total bill was around $265. And so, both my husband and I began bringing our cars to Hals, have physically brought 2 friends there and recommended Hals to countless others.  They are honest - a rarity. They get the work done right and on time. I am always impressed when they tell me not only when some things need to be repaired right away, but when other things can wait. I know I can trust them either way. I drive a 19 year-old Acura, and Hal's has worked on it for probably half that time. I would not go to another care care business in town.</Review>

This was my first time axe-throwing and I was honestly very surprised to have an amazing experience!
My two biggest concerns before coming here were [1] Lack of outdoor space as this place seemed indoors from the pictures and [2] potentially heavy weight axes would mean that this experience would soon get tiring!

I’m happy that both of my concerns turned out to be false alarms! While this place is partially indoors, they’ve opened up the doors on both sides thereby allowing plenty of air circulation. Also, you can be masked while throwing the axes thereby making this a safe experience!

With regards to the axes, they have a pretty huge selection of axes ranging from lightweight to moderate and then the more heavier ones! Surprisingly none of the axes were as heavy and once our trainers taught us the right technique, it was smooth sailing from there!

In terms of logistics, there’s plenty of parking available. Besides axe throwing, you can also order drinks and beers. It’s worth noting that all slots start and stop at the same time and are 1:15 hours long ! If you’re certain that you’re not gonna be able to make it in time for your reservation, I’d call the place up and try to reschedule instead of coming in midway through your slot.

Highly highly recommend this experience especially with a larger group of friends !< /Text>

<Text>Super fun and unique experience. I’d never tried it before and was nervous at the beginning but after awhile we got the hang of it. It does get a bit hot inside on warm days but that would really be my only critique.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNexkN8CKXSoaLf_5_sU8av1I3xNp20fKfAW2tF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPv1qWh5k9BZWBV2-c6boYXq3Toc_a146a64ig=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwyLQjMdcBXXYbbf9Mz7x58rpM3PU-7BT-jcOr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Rate>5< /Rate>< name>

<review>Fun place to spend couple hours.
People here are very friendly and they share with you how to throw the axe, and also the walk around to coach you on how to do it better.
It’s actually much harder than I thought. Hi it pretty fun :)< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC4VazhkYkT-KDo8qKydexPEVg0INT-gJC2NzS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPinAwP4gQCtL1qJGpMdExA2l3dZXmLANyIptlc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxtQVliAkP2_7zQdaFprZWfc3CpCQ7fXMse2l4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwqdCt0aEjmBdsZqLFwsTN70C09-6VLqTTsFuU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<text>Finally decided to try this place out for date night!  It was so much fun and easy to learn.  The staff were friendly and helpful- great training!  Highly recommend going here,  can't wait for the next time!   It's humid but they open the doors and have fans.<//text>< pictures>

Had a great team building experience with my coworkers.  We wanted to try something all of us had never done before.  The proprietors demonstrated some techniques to achieve a "stick".  They also shared safety protocols.  They were covid safe, had a couple of very large fans circulating air and doors at the front and back always open.  Had lots of different size axes to try.  Lots of fun!  Would do again.< /Review>

<review>This place is dope! Staff is super friendly and throwing axes is so much fun. It took a little a while to get into it, the first 20min the axe never stuck, but then we figured it out and I managed to hit the bulls eye. Perfect place for hanging out with friend and have fun.<//review>< Pictures>

We had some problems with booking online, it set up a appointment at the Berkley site in stead of San Jose. The team and management there was great, they hopped on the situation and fixed the issue for us. The place was a blast, rock music playing, smiling faces every where we looked. We even spent a little extra and bought the Bleeding clown target. That target is a game changer for axe throwing.

I most defiantly will be back, this place was fun. even with the sore arm the next day.<//text>

<text>You don't have to be an athlete to enjoy chucking sharp objects at walls! I had a blast at Axeventures. At the beginning, a staff member much pluck and panache gave us a tutorial and taught us how to throw safely. We were lousy so she kindly gave us further pointers. With her help I was able to sink a few axes in the target. There was no snobbery, only an invitation to have a great time and laugh at yourself. The venue is small but comfy. Looks a bit like a garage. It is well lit and set up with chain-link walls to prevent any rogue axes from flying too far. Great place! I wish them success.<//text>< UserId.>

SO HAPPY about this great addition to San Jose! This place is so much fun! The staff is attentive and friendly, the decor and vibe is great, and the music definitely adds to the experience! There are also so many axes to choose from! This is a great place to come with big groups or even just a nice date night! Can't wait to come back!<//Text>

<Text>We had a family fun outing even though my 8 yr old would make me nervous when he would throw his axe. We did receive great instructions to start us off in the beginning. It is done in a group setting. Most customers were wearing masks. I felt safe with the wonderful ventilation. I do recommend this place for a new and exciting time. It is something different. Lucca was awesome with giving us tips for a better throw, history about some of the axes and he has competed in axe throwing before so he just enhances the overall experience. There are light snacks such as chips and bottled soda & drinks. No alcohol but not sure if that would be a good idea with axes being thrown. It was fun and we will be back!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>109883120923051024836</user_id><response>None<//response><username>Valerie C.< /username></record>

This place is legit! It has like 11 lanes for axe throwing . Definitely a good experience. It’s so spacious. I came with my friends and had a great time! I think this is the first axethrowing spot in San Jose so it’s worth a try. Definitely a great place to take your dates. I’ll be coming back to practice more for sure!!<//text>

<Review>Highly recommend booking a few lanes for your upcoming post-vaccination group activity!

-Coaches are friendly and offer great guidance and tips
-Ample space in the cages and 10+ lanes
-A lot of seats and tables setup right by the lanes to congregate as you wait for your turn
-Restrooms are clean, well-lit AND well-maintained!!! (+2 stars just for that alone)
-For those who are itching to update your social media feeds after social distancing for 14+ months, you have a dope mural, several neon signs and a plant wall to take your photos with.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

My fiancé and I were looking for something a little different to do on our day off, and uncovered that Axeventures was finally opening back up. We had an absolute blast for the hour we had. The environment is great and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We are 100% coming back!</text>

Such a fun experience! Definitely going back, and definitely recommend. Pricing is decent, especially for the amount of time you get, tutorial is brief but they are constantly walking around and watching people who need extra pointers. Pricing for the bleeding poster is a bit excessive, but it's a pretty fun challenge!<//text>

After the appetizers, we had the most wonderful meals including the veal (yes its light and the portion is less, but with how good the flavor is and the price of veal it's well worth it!)  We also had fettuccine carbonara which outshines any restaurant nearby. If you're deciding between this place and any other nearby, this place would take it for me anytime!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Great pizza and VERY generous toppings.  Slices are so big they are hard to pick up.  Definitely need to use a fork and knife if you don't want your toppings falling all over the place.  Not shoot on the cheese either.  I'll be back!<//Review>

<text>Classic Italian fare. The lobster ravioli is unbelievably good and worth every penny. With that being said, the veal was good but almost non existent. Two and a half of very thin slices, a half? Not worth the high price. The bolognese was good but could’ve used a bit more meat.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCFY-O_rq2MuuINczjr3nYSfecZN5d1t6-H7-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORJsMCJxJaglqeylXCBZmmvlAfpq2opALCq3IC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Man.  I really don't like deep dish pizza.  So what am I supposed to do?  Give them a bad rating?  Nah.  I think they make fine deep dish pizza.  I just don't like it.  Too tomato-y.  Too saucy.  I don't really know what to say anymore.
Edit: Owner responded graciously.  5 stars.  It's good deep dish, I just don't like deep dish.< /Text>

All of the staff were nice and attentive. However, when we were nearing the end of our visit, they weren’t very accommodating to our split payment needs. We are traveling as a group friends for spring break but they didn’t seem to understand that we needed to pay separately. Felt rushed & they were slightly rude but the food was good! Slightly overpriced as well.</Review>< rating>

<review>I'll start by saying that the pasta was delicious.
The service was fantastic. The lighting was nice. It was wheelchair accessible.

The only thing I will say is that the bruchetta didn't have enough basil and it should never be heated or warm tomato on it. It also had too much  cheese on top.
The free bread comes with oil and balsamic... though there was not enough vinegar i could barely taste.

I will not be back. However im Italian so im picky with these things. It was nice otherwise.</review>< pics>

At first we thought it was not impressive because of the way it looks. We came in ordered food, and when it came out it was delicious!!! Nice atmosphere- we talked to a couple sitting next to us. They were from Germany on tour in the US. Overall, it was a very nice experience and for sure we will come again when we are in the vicinity.

Came in as a single diner and was treated like a vip!   The wait staff is personable and attentive without hovering, and this place is quiet enough to enjoy an intimate conversation!  The food was great, with a delicious savory leaning, no overwhelming spices but very fresh ingredients!  The fettuccini alone is worth the trip:. Chewy, tender and see-through thin!!  The Alfredo sauce was rich and delicious without even a hint of goopiness or heaviness!</Review>

Dinner was disappointing. Was expecting a lot better. They got 1 extra star for presentation, quantity and service. Had 2 dishes neither custom both fish shellfish based. On further thought never did find the fish in that one dish nor flavor for that matter. Once we see canned mushrooms you can expect the quality to go down hill quickly.  Not a place I plan on going back to. Shoulda gone with the sushi place up the block.< /text>

This homely restaurant has delicious Italian food as if it's a restaurant in Rome. There is usual a dinner rush, so it is wise to make a reservation. The service is excellent, and the waiters and waitresses are very accommodating. One important thing of note is to avoid the first table at the front of the restaurant. It is right next to the oven, and gets unbearably hot. Other than that, this is a wonderful restaurant to get away from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco.<//Review>

<review>Nice little Italian place a few blocks away from our hotel. The food was really good and the service was decent even though they were pretty busy that night. It wasn’t badly priced for being downtown SF and best of all it wasn’t a regular chain restaurant. It’s a little small so there might be a wait but it’s worth it.</review><date>1531020585962< /date><userid>105349076692134974402</userid>< Response>

This is a nice and friendly little Italian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. Food is good, you can get several traditional Italian dishes, and the service is also very friendly. Prices are not very expensive for downtown San Francisco. This is also not a boring chain restaurant...< /review>

Crab bisque was luke warm and penne was ordinary. The soap dispenser in the bathroom didn't work so had to use hand sanitizer.  Even the preliminary bread was basic and flavorless. Not worth the price.< /Review>

<Text>This is probably one of the finest Italian restaurants we have been so far. We went there for a dinner and had a great time, of course at the cost of a big hole in our pocket.

Food:
We had Bruschetta, Ravioli Di Spinachi, a classic Tiramisu and the Dessert of the day (Cannoli) and none of them disappointed. Bruschetta were good - nothing too facy or overdone but just right. Ravioli Di Spinachi was amazing. Filling was good and the parmesan sauce was brilliant. What blew away our mind was Tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. It is a must try and a disappointment if you're planning Italian desserts and not ordering Tiramisu. Cannoli was good but not so much that it goes into the list of Dessert of the Day.
Overall, the food was quite above the benchmark but it is quite heavily priced too, so be ready to sign a big check at the end.

Ambiance:
The place is a little dark. Perhaps a little more bright light will give it a better feeling. Not much cramped and very comfortable seating - more like restaurants which are meant for fine dining. Given that we went on a weekday night, it wasn't much crowded.

Service:
The service was good and quick. The food took reasonable time to come. But if you're in a rush, this restaurant is not for you. The staff is good overall - no bad experience as such.

Overall, if you're in San Francisco, this restaurant is a must try if you want to taste some real good Italian.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8085808de181fbb3:0x3b273ce2003bcbd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My sister had been here for work a few times and my youngest niece was just thru here a couple of weeks ago on a college tour. We gad a very long day driving up from San Diego and asked our concierge for a casual pasta Italian place close by. He recomended this wonderful gem. Food was very good, service nice and accommodating. I got the putenessca (so not how you spell it I'm sure.) Mom the cabonera, and sister & niece the spinach ravioli.  All were very pleased with their choices. Woukd defiantly recomend.< /text>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) The decor is not the highlight of this restaurant but it is better a deco average but good food. And that's the case, very nice surprise. We did not expect to eat as well in an Italian restaurant run by Asian people ;-)

La décoration n'est pas le point fort de ce restaurant mais il vaut mieux une déco moyenne mais de bons plats. Et c'est le cas, très belle surprise. Nous ne nous attendions pas à manger aussi bien dans un restaurant italien tenu par des asiatiques  ;-)< /review></record>

<text>Terrible customer service.  Waited in line for a long time.  No organization at all.  Security guard busy chatting inside while people waiting and tellers available.  Bank representative who can out to answer my question was rude and unprofessional.   Corporate should come and clean house.<//text></record>

I'm leaving this audio feedback through talk-to-text simply to emphasize the non-use of my grammar and the ability of explaining my situation. I had an appointment today at 10:30 a m, today is Saturday May 23rd, 2020. And I had an appointment with a lady who was very rude to me, very brash, had no professional consideration whatsoever.  I do not have an ID I need to get a replace. Her name was Gisena... read my security code out loud, she was rude with me, completely unprofessional, and did not even introduce herself until I had mentioned it to her. She was unreasonably loud, while telling me my PERSONAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION.

By far, THE WORST BOA teller/banker I've dealt with in all of Bakersfield. As long as my money is being utilized in a banking institution I'm a legitimate customer. And to be treated as such, if I did get super rich, or come into a great deal of money, Gisena ALONE, would disqualify Bank Of America from my millions of dollars.</Review>

This bank needs more tellers , particularly on the 1st. and 3rd of the month !!!  Sometimes they only have one teller working and a line of customers that stretches outside the doors of this bank and down the sidewalk !!! Other than this ,they seem to do a pretty good job !!!< /Text>

The worst bank experience ever and thank god i don't have an account with them.  Had a personal situation, they were not helpful i had to do the go around with no help or guidance, just we need this and this and how you get it, not our problem. Then corporate isnt much better, took years off my life with all the stress they borught on. Wont recommend this bank to anyone, unless i dont care for them< /Review>

Very poor management, does’nt matter what day you come here , they always have a one teller for business and one teller for regular customers , last week i spent 2 hours and 5 mins in a line , hire more workers , nobody has that much time to wait in the lines, thats why more and more customers are going to other banks, i am not coming back here again<//Review>

< Review>
I have been with B OF A over 20 years, and I go to the branch on down town truxton , so I tried this banking Ming I went once , and it was ok not your best people there, then I gave it another try because it's close to home , well I work at a busy place as well so I was trying to be patient because I know what it feels like on the other side, the tellers were of men and women, All the men did not greet at all, there were a few women when they walked passed said in Spanish and English good morning welcome to Bank of America!! But some passed you up like they sucked on a lemon and was forced to be there, I ask for the manager ! She was not busy just standing there in the back round so I figured she had time for me at least 5 min if that ! She told me to have a seat and it will be about 30 min to talk to me, REALLY !!!! I said so fast you need to have a class for your employees on greeting and making people feel welcome, I also told her , when you think about it mamm , if it wasn't for us as CUSTOMERS, YOU ALL would NOT HAVE A JOB, she said ok by and walked away !!! that was so rude I need to get her name and this branch at that place NEEDS investigation fast !! I will never step foot in there again EVER that sad👎🏼< /Review>

< review>
I waited 30 min in line in order to exchange currency. When it was finally my turn for help I was told to wait another 30 mins because the "special person" who can do that is on lunch and that's our manager . So am I supposed to wait an hour to just get currency exchanged ? Horrible customer service<//review>

With the current covid situation my husband and I have been having troubles making our monthly payments. When we were unable to make our payments we spoke to someone in the office and they told us to give whatever we could, that as long as we were making payments we were good. We gave bigger payments whenever we got money. After this last payment a week ago I asked for a receipt and noticed they had been adding late fees to our account. How do you tell a customer you are going to be understanding with their situation and then behind their backs add late fees. Not only that but once you sign a contract and you have a question good luck with them getting to answer them. You call and they say they will call you within 48 hrs and that doesn’t happen. You have to be calling until they finally decide to assist you< /text>

She didn't even shake hands to greet us.  Paid $70 for a 7 minute interview.  I just wish she had better customer care, and would attempt to build a rapport of trust with her clients and prospect clients, specially in a law office were trusting your lawyer is very important, she didn't make us feel welcomed. It felt so rush.</review>< pictures>

< review>
I had such a bad experience with this attorney not to mention her staff is so rude and unprofessional  they need some serious people skills.

2 years ago I had my immigration appointment a day before her office call me asking me to go to their office because Mitchell wanted to review everything with before my big day. So i get there and they tell me she is not there so her paralegal had to help me out, she tells me michelle would not be able to attend my meetings with me because she had a bigger case (imagine
that) instead she was going to send another attorney that she works with by the name Robert de lamadrid , I'm sorry Michelle but if I'm paying for your services I expect for you to be there.

The next day me and my wife arrived 45 early to my appointment waiting for this attorney to show up well guess what
HE NEVER SHOWED UP
he left me and my wife to deal with this situation on our own. I call Michelle office upset and frustrated to let them know what was my situation and all they said we cant   get ahold of the attorney,  my appointment was 11am by 11:30 this attorney that mitchelle had send in her place was nowhere to be found, so I dicited to do my interview with my wife and the immigration officer with out the attorney.

After exiting my interview 30-45 later an still no sign of this attorney Robert de la Madrid me and my wife went home. I immediately call mitchelle office   and ask to speak with her but her office told me she was not there so I spoke with the same paralegal who I saw the day before my interview she gave me such a an dumb excuse letting me know the attorney had gotten into and accident and his phone broke, i could believe what she was saying how absurd was that his phone broke unbelievable.

3 hours later i recived a call from Michelle I was expecting a big apology from her but instead she just told me it was a mistake for me to have done the interview on my own, and by the way she still charge me her full price even though her attorney that she send never showed up.  I couldn't believe the lack of professionalism I would never recommend her office to any friends or family members.< /review>

Once you give her the money, she'll forget about your case.
At first, her and her staff were really friendly and promised good results of course. She asked for half the total cost to begin the case and the other half a month later, after the total amount was paid she completely changed her attitude. It's always really difficult to get in contact with her, staff always says she's not available and to call later. When I am finally able to talk to her, she is rude and tells me she will do the work eventually. I constantly have to waste hours to find information that she is supposed to know and share with me as the client.< /Text>

<Text>Michelle was very upfront with me when I went for my wife's case, since I had removed my wife from the USA she suggested for me not to waste money on attorneys and do all the leg work myself and if approved only come back for the waivers. I could have walked away and go to another attorney waste thousands of dollars but I took the tisk and was approved. I went back to Michelle and her and her staff guided me through the last steps and was ver succesfull bringing my wife back. Thank you Michelle and Staff<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) I came from dealing with 3 lawyers, two of them the most famous in the Los Angeles area, but I only paid them a lot of money and they never helped me, but when I arrived with the lawyer Michelle Gonzalez, even having a bad record, I received the best treatment and attention from the First date now as a citizen of the United States and almost 10 members of my family have emigrated by her, I can only say THANK YOU! For her help she represented me when I needed it most personally, and I still call her to say Thank you for your help and she still advises me telling me to register to vote and make the adjustment in Social Security. THANK YOU! Lawyer one more time .....

<username>Kraig Beale< /username>< review>
A small local boutique coffee House. It's small and very cute.
My wife appreciated the clean bathroom.
I was fascinated by the
Bakery goods.
I ordered fresh fruit and a yogurt with a large dark cup of coffee
It was morning we sat in the sunshine outside and drank our coffee and had our delights.
We then drove North and stopped at Anos Nuevo State
Park and walked on the beach.
Never knowing that in a few days a tropical lightning storm would sweep up the coast and light the hills on fire behind Santa Cruz and along the  San 0 Mateo coast.</review>

Love the food, and the espresso coffee drinks are some of the best I have ever had. Super disappointed in the service, however. (Sorry to say it) The folks behind the counter are often surly, rude, and routinely mess up orders. I get it, it’s early, but it would be awesome to see a smile once in a while :)<//Text>

I’m a coffeetopia regular! Their bagel sandwiches are a great quick breakfast, and their mocha is the best in town. The chocolate croissant, gently warmed, is a great companion to your morning coffee. Coffeetopia’s cozy, laid back atmosphere makes it a great place to sit and relax for a while.< /Text>

What a lovely, local coffee shop! The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they really try their best to cut down on wait time. Try the Ethiopian pour over if you like a dark, rich coffee to start your morning. Also, they serve Udis gluten free bagels and have vegan options, too! 👍👍<//review>

<Review>I spotted this cute coffee shop while driving up North towards San Francisco. And I'm glad I did it, because the double espresso (which I always have it without anyhting added) was excellent. The nice (and handsome) barista offered to serve it in a real cup, a gesture which I really appreciated. Too bad I wasn't into trying any of their pastries, maybe next time I happen to be in the area.</Review><gmap_id>0x808e6a7f7487215b:0xf7820af6649f4f5e<//gmap_id>< response>

One door allows entry and another door allows pick-up after your name is called. Customers can wait outside. There is also hand sanitizer by the register. Staff were friendly.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbE3l1lix9ihwGi3TvA7hKAlNAeW0KOgN7ozfe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUc_jBM-3SdJ-6EEgZ8CDz2keFvSttK641HvvB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8WC8FTxXvceF5qvsIo55HanuRNtyXXMYD4rJy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOINJSKzF3y0uoSexFIwSVZ_GITDueBdydh7MN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

I visit often and there is so much to love. I would start with any savory pastry or special menu item, like a breakfast sandwich or burrito. The cream cheese danishes are great too. I always grab a snickerdoodle cookie for later although later is usually not long after leaving.</Text>

Very unfriendly female associate.  My husband and I were Covid compliant with our masks and after ordering were told to wait outside.  Yet a couple behind us, clearly regulars, were allowed to remain inside. Drinks were ok. Do not recommend patronizing due to the unfriendly young woman.< /text>

<name>Evan Calip< /name><Text>Timeless is the best coffee in the bay. Full stop. You should come here and get coffee. While you're at it get a pastry or a vegan donut cause they're also really freaking good. I'm not even vegan like that. One of the few places in my life where no matter how long the line, I'm standing in it.

I used to travel miles for Timeless to a point where we just decided to move closer to it. I mean... It's not the only reason we moved to Oakland but it definitely was a reason.< /Text>< pictures>

Evrything is vegan and delicious. Highly recommend the chocolate croissants, which are only available on sundays, or the pesto cheese roll. Thier breads have great texture but thier chocolates could have better taste for the price. Thier raised donuts have the best texture out of any vegan donuts in or near Oakland.< /Text>

<Text>Nicole is a very sweet girl. She made my hair so stunning. She always listens to me exactly what I want and I am super happy and satisfied with my hair. She entertains me throughout the whole service and never hesitates to answer all my questions to my full satisfaction. I really loved her because she gave some points of view on how to maintain my hair strong and beautiful. Keep it up, Nicole. Highly recommended!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>This coffee shop was the best! They have the best coffee available and even some fresh baked goods as well. The ambiance of this shop was so relaxing, and the staffs are highly capable. All of them are very responsive every time I asked questions. The shop was also very cleaned. A strong recommendation for you! Cheers!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great vegan breakfast with good service.

Many vegetarian and vegan varieties for a quick bite.

The place is small and crowded a bit. Seems like that is a norm.

Prices are expensive but expected for Berkeley standards.< /text>

I needed to order a vegan birthday cake, and came across Timeless after some research. I drove down from San Jose just to pick up the cake from Timeless, and it was absolutely worth the hassle. The chocolate peanut butter cake was decadent and delicious, and better than most non vegan cakes I've had. Would wholeheartedly recommend.</Text>

Spicy garlic ramen and the okra nigiri are a must try.

I was amazed to find that EVERYTHING here is vegan (they don't advertise that really), though they only have a couple of items that are gluten-free (aside from their chocolates). The first time I came, they only had the tea cake and were out of everything else gluten-free, and the second time I came, there was a gluten-free quiche but I wasn't hungry enough for a whole quiche, so I got the tea cake again.

The tea cake is delicious and you wouldn't really know it was vegan and gluten-free unless someone told you (at least, I don't think so). Great texture and not at all dry or crumbly. Speedy checkout and there are a fair number of tables to sit at, but most of them were occupied when I was there both times.

I will have to try their coffee at some point next time I'm back in the Bay Area.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ4HPTe-sfL14X_gRomTeLgaLqLxMzQJwMydbA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfFzfk4DkztTjHQ-Mg3mPqhlNfbXYoOfH_Jzby=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<review>5 stars for both their food and their coffee. I went to Colombia last year, and they have the best single origin Colombian coffee I've tried since returning. The food is all vegan and amazingly delicious-- the cinnamon bun was incredible in particular. The staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable about the coffee. The prices are what you'd expect for a nice coffee shop in this area. Great place to stop in for a coffee and pastry before or after a walk in the cemetery!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<username>Steve Guttbinder< /username><date>1608248908839<//date><Rate>3< /Rate><review>Update: You can't beat the product here, but no one is s repeat customer due to their service. Maybe it's their thing to not be friendly or helpful (which is a thing believe it or not! Google "Shopsin's" in NYC) - but these folks barely crack a smile, are not open to any helpful feedback from their diehard customers, and have made it a passtime to yell at customers for walking in to their front door during COVID when all they need to do is put up a sign staying their rules at the front door. If the food weren't as amazing as it is, I would (along with others) gladly bring my business elsewhere.

I think it's great that they don't advertise themselves as vegan... because everything just tastes so amazingly good! Once you find out of all dairy free (I'm lactose intolerant) this place will become your go to dessert spot for life!< /review>< pics>

The timeless coffee is a must-have, I prefer mine black and it was just as good (for my taste!).

<review>I only know them from after Corona times, Inwish I had been here earlier. Nevertheless, their coffee is great and they are very careful with 6ft measures. Loved their alMond croissant. Their opening times are shorter than before Covid.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< username>

Absolutely love it here. We had the Twinkie, cocoa, cappuccino, and a pour over Ethiopian. All we're delicious, made with intention and presented in a lovely way. The atmosphere is great for hanging out, doing work, chatting... We saw a huge table with a few families gathering and several people alone on laptops, people reading and people getting coffee to go. If we lived in the area, we'd definitely pick this as a regular spot. Also, if you're not sure about a dairy-less latte, or cappuccino, I'd recommend trying your drink with Oat Milk. It checks all the creamy, frothy and delicious boxes for me at least. In my opinion, it's much more full and creamy than soy or almond milk. At any rate, I highly recommend!</review>

The real issue was the barista. Dude acted like he was too cool to take our order completely, and wouldn't you know it we were served hot drinks when we ordered ice.
Maybe pick someone who isn't so cool to take orders and interact with the public because we will not be back.<//review>< user_name>

Excellent vegan pastry shop and restaurant. They have vegan donuts, pies, cakes, and savory dishes like shepherd's pie and more. They also have gluten free options if that's your jam. I had a mini pumpkin pie today that was so creamy and delicious!</Review>

Gosh, where to start... Do you see the line? Do you see the parking? That's because this place is WORTH. IT.

The tiramisu cake is to die for.  The donuts are surprisingly fruity and delicious.  I was broken-hearted when the cream cheese breakfast roll was discontinued, and elated when they brought it back.  The latte is fantastic.  I like their Sunday brunch but rarely order it due to how much I love the regular pastries etc.

Can't find a table? Take it to go and walk to Mountain View cemetery for beautiful views and a contemplative time.  Even when it's busy, you just can't go wrong.< /Text>

Asked for water and was given boiling hot water resulting in first degree burns. All of the employees seemed great except the lady in purple hair who gave me the scolding hot water. Piedmont has great coffee shops, avoid this one at all costs.< /review>

<text>One of the best and as far as I know the only fully vegan bakery, dessert place in the bay area. When I have the chance to come by, I just stock up on my favorite ones (scones, thumbprint cookie, apple walnut cake, danish, and so much more). They also have a select but tasty brunch menu. Be sure to try their hot chocolate or mocha with oat milk. Yum!

Tip: The area does get crowded, but usually there is parking available in nearby adjacent residential streets. I would also recommend getting to go as the place does get crowded.</text>< resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>The best vegan bakery in San Francisco is not in San Francisco. This Oakland gem (and small Berkeley location) is worth venturing to the East Bay. Plenty of cakes by the slice, donuts, and chocolates to pick from plus a small selection of savory stuff like pizza pockets, and tater tot frittata. Get there early if you want to enjoy a breakfast burrito on a Saturday. Small brunch menu is served on Sundays only until they sell out.< /Text>< Pictures>

The place is cool and weird. The staff is chill with an edgy look to them. Best thing about this place is that everything is vegan (they do not market that or say that it is) they have tons of pastry's that all look delicious. I had the raspberry lemon cake and it was amazing one of the best slices of cake that I have had in my life and you don't feel as bad as regular cake. Also shared the birthday cake and it was good more of a suttle flavor. The environment was chill and relaxing with wifi and friendly.< /Review>

My favorite coffee shop in the bay area, hands down. I wish both locations carried the breakfast rolls but I can go to berkeley for them at least. Cheesecake and oat lattes are out of this world. The first few times I went I had to triple check that it was all vegan. Careful though, seating is hard to come by during brunch times, which makes it hard on those with disabilities who can't stand for long periods of time to wait for a table to clear.< /text>

Excellent vegan pastries. Like the best vegan pastries I've ever had. And I'm not vegan. But unfortunately for me, the place is very popular and so its always loud and rarely has a place to sit. Get pastries for takeout but don't come here for a coffeeshop experience.<//Text>

<Review>I had to fix their wobbly table since our coffee was flying everywhere and the dude just watched me fix it. If your customer is fixing your table, maybe help them out? It took 10 minutes for a cappuccino and they weren't busy... They only had sweets and no savory snacks and no glass covering on the food so  everybody spoke over the food (gross). For 2 coffees and pastries, 20 dollars. Even for SF that's crazy.  So... good ambiance overall. I'd just go to the 20 other cute cafes with better coffee food and service.</Review><UserId.>106149882334724771014</UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

Great atmosphere, super great staff, and tasty food. I give the espresso 6/10 but it's usually preferable to spending $$~BIG BUCKS~$$ at Blue Bottle down the street.

I love taking early morning walks up Piedmont and making Timeless one of my stops!</Text>

This is a "must visit" stop if you are walking around the area.  Excellent selection of items for your snacking needs.  We LOVE the "Moonpie"...wow these are great.  I will visit again on our next trip to Oakland.</Review>

So many great offerings! A vegan haven that even non plant-based diet people will love. I finally had the Sunday brunch and the Chao omelet was amazing! All the pastries, chocolates, and specialty cakes are delicious. We order cakes for many of our families birthdays. There are so many great vegan goods here.< /Review>

Absolutely delicious vegan pastries. Honorable mention for the broccoli quiche and pesto roll...out of this world!

Gal who ran the checkout was lovely, the space was perfect for a morning hangout.

I also noted a few gluten free options-can’t speak to their safety w/ cross contamination but they looked great!< /Text>

Very relaxing coffee shop with sublime pastries. The latte art is a nice touch. Whenever I'm in Oakland I try to make it a priority to stop in and get a mocha and either a donut or one of their seasonal pumpkin rolls. Knowing that everything there is vegan and cruelty-free is just the icing on the... donut.<//text>

The best all vegan coffee shop I’ve been to. My samples size is less than 5, but the coffee, interior design, and snacks are phenomenal.

This is a great place to meet a friend, colleague, or do some deep work. My chief complaint is that there’s no WiFi. I’ve tried to work here a couple of times and unless you’re well prepared for things you can do offline, it doesn’t go well. I’d come here much more often on my trips to SF if they had it. They don’t seem to want to draw the working type but it seems like a missed business opportunity for them... my hope is one day they’ll change that.<//Text>

Amazingly delicious!! If I need my vegan sweet tooth  fix then this is where I'd go. The coffee was great, the baked goods were fantastic, I just wish there were a few more healthy options to choose from (fruit, oatmeal, etc.). I didn't see anything healthier like that in the display case.< /Review>

<Text>Heaven on earth. The desserts and pastries are out of this world with flavor, texture, consistency and taste. This is my favorite bakery in the Bay area and I highly recommend it for vegans and non-vegans a lot. There isn't anything here that I haven't tried and didn't like. Please check this place out.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>My first visit was during a spring rain; I had ordered two cakes for a party (Red Velvet and Birthday cake- both were moist and delicious- would never guess they are vegan) and an oat milk latte to go. The experience was almost magical- busy but warm staff.  Have visited many times since and always wonderful.  Usually go in the early afternoon and am able to find a good parking spot nearby- only once had to circle round the area.</Review>< Pics>

This place is amazing and ALL VEGAN! We always come here to get our birthday cakes or yummy fun treats. Even if you're not vegan, the food will taste amazing to you and it's likely that you won't realize it's vegan to begin with because of how great it tastes, especially the donuts and the cakes.< /Review>

I did not realize they didn't have dairy, but that's ok. Oat milk is interesting (the cappacino was tasty with it). The pastries all looked amazing, the avocado toast came with tons of avocado. Price wise I was surprised at how reasonable it way (compared to other hipster too cool for school coffee shops). I'll be back.< /review>

Ordered online. Over twenty minutes wait for pick up! And then they couldn't find the order for like 10 minutes. Coffee and pastries were cold. What is the point of ordering online if you can't let customers pickup????</text>

This is one of my favorite cozy coffee shops that also offers amazing vegan food.  Their meals and pastries are completely vegan and are packed with amazing flavors. I like the punky vibe that is also welcoming. It is a true cozy spot with wifi and great food and drink. It is a meetup spot for friends or coworkers, and a place where you can get some work done in a fun environment.</Text>

A phenomenal vegan bakery and some of the best pour over coffee-- scratch that, some of the best coffee I have ever had. Its also in a great location. Perfect for people watching as you ponder how the hell they made this cheesecake so fantastic without any cheese...</text>

I had a pretty fantastic mocha here, with oat milk, which I am glad to see is being offered at more and more coffee places, it's definitely a better alternative to shoot or almond in my opinion.  I am not a vegan but can attest the vegan baked goods pass my test, the crust on my empanada was perfectly flaky and tender.  Cozy atmosphere and friendly service too, definitely recommended!< /text>

I am so excited I found this place! Such an amazing variety of vegan desserts, friendly, helpful staff, good atmosphere. And, to top it off, since going vegan, I am actually enjoying a latte with almond milk. My mind is blown. Chocolate cake is also awesome. The waiter even gave me the latte free "in case you don't like it." I'm coming back for sure.</Review>

I can't say enough about this all vegan gem.  This has truly been the highlight of our California trip so far.  Timeless coffee roasters is a by far the best vegan bakery I've found to date.  Not only do they have a wide variety of desserts and pastries to choose from but they have breakfast, lunch,  daily specials (today's specials were a pot pie and curry lentil soup, both utterly fantastic!) and superb coffee.  I must have ordered everything on the menu.  My favorite was the pepperoni roll: melted cheddar and pepperoni inside a delicious biscuit. The food here is constantly flying off the shelves and being restocked just as fast. The staff is extremely kind,  accommodating and efficient. A great welcoming decor on the inside and comfortable outside seating make this wonderful establishment perfect for large and small groups alike.  Whether you are a vegan with a cause or a carnivore who's in the mood for a slamming cup of Joe, delicious sweets or a meal that won't disappoint, Timeless Coffee Roasters is the place for you.  Shout out to, Rich for being such a wonderful and accommodating host!

P.s. furry friends are welcome here!</Text>

Hands down the first place I think of anytime I'm in the Bay area. I make sure to stop by the Oakland location whenever possible. The food is phenomenal and for someone who has been looking for tasty dairy free and (some) gluten free treat, this is the place to go. It has inspired me to try my own hand at making vegan deserts because now I know they exist and it can be done. They also have delicious oatmilk, which I had never heard of before but is now my favorite latte milk because of how the flavor blends with the espresso. I would highly recommend this place to everyone.</text>

The first all vegan cafe that does it right. None of the attitude of "We don't have any milk", but a nice recommendation of "would you like Almond or Soy milk in your ___"? Also, the best almond latte I have found in the Bay Area!</Text>

The food & coffee are great. I used to like picking up pastries for dessert from Timeless. But for some reason, every time I go I am met with the most extremely unpleasant attitudes. Workers that were smiling & laughing with the customer in front of me become extremely apathetic & disinterested when they see me. Like they literally cannot wait for me to go.

I've come in on my own & with others, and this attitude is always the case. I am not sure what I did; I always tip and I've never stayed there for longer than it took to finish my coffee. Customer service is very hard work, so I don't like to get down on service workers; but regular rudeness that others don't seem to get is highly suspicious when it's coming from gentrifiers.

My recommendation is if you want to try this place out, send in a white hipster to place the order for you. I've never had food from here I didn't like, so it's a real shame they have issues with *some* of their customers.</Review>

Not posted anywhere I could see that this is a vegan coffee shop. So, after ordering and paying $3.50 for a cup of coffee, and tipping a buck -  I wanted to add cream to my coffee. Seeing there was only almond milk available I asked for cream and was told no.  I get it, you’re a vegan spot, so please, just post that so one can see it BEFORE ordering and paying.

I don’t drink my coffee black, and I don’t enjoy the taste of almond milk, so I basically threw $4.50 away.</Text>

Absolutely the best coffee , roasted on the spot, in the area. Classy, vegan,(not my style- but great chocolate), and choice of almond or soy for your milky drink.  Take the latte w almond milk. The owner was the old roaster for Sightglass in SF. His coffee mix is well done: a high nutty note, with a slightly acidic base, 2 distinct notes that goes together. I prefer if they play more chilled out music, but it's my go to spot.< /Text>

<Review>The employees are incredibly rude. This place comes off as super exclusive and overly hipster. Everything is overpriced for the quality. I was told there was no wifi after spending over twenty bucks here and tipping generously even though I read in the reviews here that they do. One girl above even says 'They do if they like you' as if that's cute. Well, sorry. I'm not a fan of discriminatory practices. Plenty of other good coffee shops in the area who don't act cliquey and selectively treat their customers like less than.<//Review>< Pics>

This is another amazing vegan place. My biggest complaint is that sometimes the pastries are too sweet. There is no Wi-Fi and parking in this area is difficult at best. That said, the coffee is excellent and the pastries are often excellent.< /text>

The actual food/meals are a hit or miss so I wouldnt take skeptical omnis here for lunch or brunch again personally.

Workers are also a hit or miss. I dont expect to make friends at establishments but I also hate that "oh I work at a hip coffee shop" holier than thou attitude which some of the workers here have. Not everyone is like this and the owner/managers are nice and seem to genuinely care about the community so I dont take it as the vibe of the shop in general.

I personally really enjoy all their cakes (especially the buche de noel which tastes just like yellow cake) and would totally bring one to a party (can usually grab & go a whole cake for last min needs).

Overall I really enjoy and would recommend this spot! Wish we had one up here in portland (=< /review>< pics>

Coffee and pastries are always on point, but the service is hit or miss. Usually a miss... I've lived in the area for 10 years now,  and used to go frequently because i like the idea of having a local roasterie, but every time i go they look at and treat me like I don't belong. I think its because i dont dress like a hispster from SF in the mid 2000s? Or maybe it's because i wear board shorts and tank tops? One time i asked if there was a short line to just buy a bag of wholebean coffee, since the line was huge and slow simply from people wanting baked goods. The dude laughed at me in front of everyone and told me to wait in the back of the line. Mind you, i had exact cash in hand. So i did, but literally 5 minutes into that wait someone went to the front and got something "real quick" from him. Maybe they were friends? If you are going to enforce a rule, enforce it failry and don't hook up people you like... especially in front of someone you just scolded for asking the same thing. Im not a huge fan of what nestle has done in the world, but thank god blue bottle just opened up down the street. And it's too bad because i love their SO whole beans!</review>

This place is such a gem! I'm so lucky to work nearby such a delicious, friendly, cozy spot. Delectable coffee and the amount of dazzling baked goods that make you hear music. (Or maybe it's just their awesome playlist in the background..)

Thank you for offering such a glorious, vegan spread!

Oh, and did I mention they do holiday pie orders?? They do. Uh. Mazing.< /review>< username>

No better coffee shop on the planet. Simple as that. In-house roasted coffee is consistently delicious (try the Merchant roast). Pastries also made in-house, which are phenomenal. 100% cruelty free. Locally owned and operated. There aren't enough words for how great this establishment is.</Text>

I love that dairy is not an option. That they are perhaps the only coffee joint that can actually make a delicious cappuccino that isn't actually a latte. And they have gluten free pumpkin pie that is delish!!</text>

Fun place to enjoy delish food, and hangout with friends or indulge in people watching.

Heartbroken to learn from the Bakery Manager that their cakes include PALM fruit/oil which is linked to deforestation and starvation of wildlife.< /Text>

Haven't even tried the food and don't care to. Dana is one of the worst employees I have ever encountered. I will NEVER return and would never recommend. She made our vacation start out on a terrible note with her condescending and poor attitude, when I asked her a simple question, and was with my toddler, no less.

If you would hire someone like her to "serve" customers (at a coffee shop, especially, where a pleasant attitude is needed as customers come in to start their day here), it speaks volumes about the kind of business you run, regardless of the food you serve. The manager also handled it incredibly poorly, with little remorse.</review>

<Text>I was in town briefly this last week and I always try and visit local coffee shops versus the chain ones. While this location is nicely put together, the short blonde girl was anything but welcoming. Her customer service was abysmal, and she should rethink her career choices, as this isn't the environment for her. Otherwise, the coffee and food was alright, but not worth the price having to deal with her pretentious attitude. I'd probably skip this joint and checkout some of the other places next time.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This is the best coffee shop and chocolatier I have ever been to. Not only is RJ and the staff super friendly and helpful, they have a wonderful variety of pastries, tasty brunch options on Sunday, and super convenient breakfast rolls and pizza rolls that you can grab on the go. Plus they are totally vegan but you would never notice. It's a win win.< /text>

Coffee is good...  there is something inauthentic about their meat can't quite put my finger on it.  Also no mention of their lack of milk or cream.  I think it may be a incognito vegan cafe.< /Review>

Vegan coffee shop with pastries, breakfast specials on the weekend (can you say VEGAN french toast? What about vegan breakfast nachos?)Timeless also has great staff. Service is quick, options are out-of-this-world. Don't come here if you are trying to avoid carbs, because everything here is carb-a-licious. P.s. The background on my phone is a picture of the assortment of donuts they offer - colorful and delicious! Keeps me coming back for more.</Review>

Short list of teas, but good ones. Great ambiance & friendly service. Have not tried their sweets, but they look very good.
Since I am a comcast user, I have access to their network of xfinity wifi hotspots, but unfortunately the signal at Timeless Coffee is worst than bad, providing a crappy connection - and they do not offer their own wifi, a lack of service that took one star off my review.
Last time I went here it was about 5pm on a weekday, and it was not crowded, perfect for doing some work on my computer - but, it would have been better if they offered wifi...
Chairs are comfortable, large windows bring great natural light to tables, made of metal and heavy wood, which makes them very stable. You can feel the care the owners have put into creating a great coffee.<//review>

The black coffee has that sorta watery/burnt flavor that reminds me of Nescafé. It's just a style preference so some people will really love it. The closest comparison I can think of is Ritual in the Mission.

Also, this is an all vegan establishment so if you don't like soy or almond flavored milk you're SOL.

The best thing is the pastries. Vegan baking has come a long way from the gut bombs of the 90s. Everything I've tried here was delicious. I just wish I liked the coffee more :s<//review>

Timeless absolutely oozes with hipster pretension. Don't walk in here wearing athletic wear, or you're bound to catch some odd stares from regulars and baristas. That said, the coffee and pastries are quite good.<//Text>

Really nice place. Quality roasted beans, beautiful bakes items. This is a full vegen coffee shop. Uoi don't have regular option at all. Really nice to see them put full of support to be a vegan coffee shop. Alought I am not super fan of soy milk or almond milk but I admire their idea.</text>

The coffee is good, but come here for their baked goods--all vegan. The one problem I encounter with this place is parking, in what is probably the worst neighborhood in Oakland for parking, exacerbated by school pickup zones nearby.< /text>

Ever heard of a cafe/coffee shop that doesn't offer wifi? Me either. Came here to do some work and was disappointed not only in the lack of wifi, but also in the fact that they don't offer any dairy. I wish I would've known before that it was 100% vegan and no wifi.</Text>

Really good vegan options but kinda expensive and needs more milk options for the coffee (almond milk doesn't mix well and looks curled)</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Top cafeteria. Delicious and delicious breakfasts. I think it's the ideal place for vegans too. The lunch break is also well served. The internal room is tastefully furnished and is very welcoming.
They are also equipped with a few tables outside. Professional and friendly staff. Prices are normal. Recommended.

(Original)
Caffetteria Top. Colazioni deliziose e sfiziose. Credo sia il posto ideale pure per i vegani. Anche la pausa pranzo è ben servita. La sala interna è arredata con gusto e risulta molto accogliente.
Sono attrezzati anche con qualche tavolino all'esterno. Personale professionale e cordiale. I prezzi sono nella norma. Consigliato.< /review>< Pics>
