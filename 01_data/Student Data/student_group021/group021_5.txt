Nice friendly service. Clean. Reliable. Tasty. All four of us were well-satisfied. Refritos and rice had a nice garlic taste. East coast visitors enjoyed their first Chilaquilles. We'll return.<//review>

<Name>Ruth Castro</Name><date>1621095172411<//date><rating>1</rating><Text>To whom this may concern today is may 15 and I came to your restaurant and sat for over 10 minutes and you server didn't acknowledge me at all while I was there she instead went ahead and assisted other people and too their other. When I got up and ask if she was going to take my order she said she thought I was waiting for my companion to arrive. Never did she ask me if I wanted to wait for him to order so for her to assume I would wait was unprofessional and very rude. She is a disgrace as a server and to be working at your restaurant it's an embarrassment. She then told me that I can get up and order while everyone else was served at their table. As a local all my life I will never recommend your restaurant again and I will surely pass my experience I had with everyone I know and thru social media.  She is the women that has work for a century there and I'm sure you get many complains about her.< /Text>< Pictures>

For those who are looking for authentic Mexican food and local, Rose Cafe is the place. This restaurant has been around for over 30 years and serving homemade recipes. Locally owned by the same family, don't miss this place when visiting Santa Barbara</Text>

The food did not taste good or authentic, you can taste the sodium though. The beans and rice had a weird taste to it and believe me I could eat rice and beans everyday and I couldn't eat theirs.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>During the pandemic I was eating outside next door at Alcazar (which is awesome). Our server at Alcazar said that the surrounding businesses were being super supportive and helpful with outside dining and sharing space. Alcazar's bathroom is through their kitchen so in order keep things more socially distant, our server suggested that we use the bathroom at Rose Cafe. He said that the owner at Rose was very supportive and was sharing their facilities. However, the staff at Rose Cafe didn't get the memo about coming together and unexpectedly kicked us out for using their rest rooms. Rose Cafe needs to learn how to support their neighbors. I won't be a customer at Rose Cafe anytime soon.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1595654087674, 'text': 'After the staff spoke with the Alcazar manager tonight, she informed our staff that they never sent their own customers to our restaurant to use our restroom. Since they have their own restroom, it seems silly that they would be sending their customers to our restroom. They are correct about us all working together during this pandemic. However, we do have guidelines about customers needing to wear their mask when entering our restaurant to use the restroom. The guidelines are posted and our customers are told this when they arrive. My staff did have to stop several people trying to come into the restaurant without their masks and ask them to put them on. Since you stated you weren\'t our customer, I understand why you "didn\'t get the memo" about the masks, but now you know! Have a wonderful Friday evening!'}< /response>< gmapID>

This was such a great stop! We were visiting from out if town and this was recommended to us by a local. It is very casual and we were seated promptly. The chips were delicious and the salsa was spicy. I ordered the kid's nacho plate and the cheese was GORGEOUS and ample. There were lots of beans and the portion was generous enough to take home. My husband's two item combo was delicious with the beef and potato taco and cheese enchilada. It was so funny when our hotel staff became so excited when we told them where we ate. It is definitely where the locals go, and I'll happily go again!</Text>

<review>I'm thoroughly addicted to this place and have been enjoying it since the 70's. I go thru Rose Cafe withdrawals a week after eating there and simply must go back for MORE. Always consistant quality in food as well as service. Also, the ambiance has had been raised numerous levels in the past few years, with the addition of the front patio.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1565036428988, 'text': 'Thank you so much for enjoying our family-run restaurant, please come back soon!'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80e9144047052baf:0x333277279a826226< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This location of Rose Cafe is the best! Friendly staff, food flavor and portions are always consistent! Great drinks! Best menudo in town, I love the Chile base they add to the broth! Nachos are huge, lots of meat! We come here 2 or more times a month! Love it!< /Text>

This place was recommended to us by a nice couple we met near the wharf. This food was fresh and DELICIOUS. The salsa and chips are amongst the best I've had and the tacos might actually be the best tacos I've ever had. If you go for the enchiladas you won't be disappointed either. Everything tastes good in its simplicity, but also hints at little dashes of original ingredients. The final nice touch of this place are the people who work there, who are all very kind.<//Review>

They have some really good food. Nachos and Menudo are the best in my opinion. The service on other hand is not consistent. On my first visit, the lady was really nice and helpful. But on other visits, I encountered other people who only cared to put the food on the table and nothing else.<//text>

First time, I recieved a large piece of steel wool in my veggie tamales. They also took almost an hour and a half to deliver our food. The second time I ordered cheese enchiladas. In my plate, there were several pieces of chicken. I politely explained to our waitress that I was a vegetarian and she was exceptionally rude about returning my plate back to the kitchen. I ended up eating around the chicken and when the bill came, I asked for the meal to be discounted in compensation for the unconvinced they had bestowed upon me. Our waitress was very rude and refused to offer us anything in return. I am sad to write this review as I am normally in full support of locally owned businesses but my experience here has been one I can not disregard. I hope that those who do end up going to this restaurant will recieve a better service than I did.</Review>< Pics>

My elderly family members continue to eat here on the Mesa. Through the years service get worse basically  horrible. When you have to wait 15 min to be acknowledge 10 min for water or drink order at 10am on a thrs. No eye contact as staff passes you & you have to wave your arms to get service there's a problem. Mexican food at Robertos is more authentic. Never again!! Will I waste my $$ here & while I'm in town neither will my family</Review>

The prices are very reasonable compared to many other Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara. I have been a regular customer of this wonderful establishment for the last 11 years, the quality of the food and service has been great year after year. If your a fan of breakfast burritos I'd highly recommend the chorizo breakfast burrito smothered in their amazing home made signature salsa! There's a reason why this restaurant has been voted as having the best Salsa in town multiple years in a row via the Santa Barbara Independent "Best Of"</review>

This is one of the best family restaurants in town. They have an amazing salsa and a very reasonably priced menu with great specials. Show up for happy hour and get 25% off cocktails and other sweet deals like cheap quesadillas. If they ever have lengua as a special, get it it's amazing. The chile verde and Chile Colorado are awesome. Great tamales and enchiladas.</Text>

<review>Waiting time is bad and they dont even approach the customer at all or even eye contact. Always short staff.Obviusly Management issues. We were waiting like others too for a table. People outside confused if a table was available or not. 20mins later we were called in and 3 tables were empty. Someone could of called 3 groups who were waiting outside but no one did. Bad Management:( Micheladas are discusting, Our food was made wrong amd no one came to see if we needed anything else.Definitely not coming back or telling friends to come.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

VERY, VERY, VERY POOR SERVICE. On a busy Sunday, only two waiters to serve the whole packed place. The food (chicken tostadas and chicken tamales) took almost half hour to arrive. We ordered guacamole as appetizer but it only arrived, minutes before the lunch proper, because we grabbed the waiter by the apron and implored for it (by the way, the guacamole wasn't worth the wait - a little more than poorly chunk avocados, almost no seasoning).That was probably our last call - a pity since the food is actually reasonable. Ah - they close early on Sundays, don't open on Mondays and are closed on vacation for a month around Christmas.<//text>

The salmon sandwich was seriously delicious. Nice size portion of salmon. No pink dye on it. They kept it simple so you could enjoy the fresh fish.</review>

<Review>Delicious every time! This time, we tried the classic wings in the diced version. They were just as good and without the inconvenience of having messy hands!

I've also tried a few other dishes that were all good too - soup, spinach. We showed up on a Monday night, right before they opened. We got in and ordered quickly, which worked well because part of our group had to catch a flight right after.

Will be back for wings!</Review>< Pics>

Awesome place! Went there with the kiddos to have late lunch and enjoyed great food sitting outside in the sun. For having already spent a while in SF, I'd say this is one of the best authentic places I've had lunch at. Very nice staff as well.< /Text>

<review>Well made veggie omelette.  Could have used some cheese but my fault for not noticing it on the ingredient list.  Home fries have a little garlic on them. Yum.   Facilities are in the process of being remodeled, I think.< /review></record>

I love this place, it is such a great sunset neighborhood restaurant, always offering fresh, delicious food and great atmosphere! And the owner is an absolute delight! I’ve been going here for 5 years now and have had never less than great things to say about it.<//text>

One of the best breakfast spots in SF!! This place is no frills, with really great, really fresh and healthy food. Stop by and enjoy a great meal and support a local, family run busy. They are doing takeout during Covid, you can eat in the parklet out front. Angeles (the owner) will
likely take your order in which case you will also experience pleasant and friendly service :)< /text>

Well prepared, moderately priced cafe diner fare. Service is good, accommodations are a little low rent, but that's how they keep the price down without reducing the food quality. Portions are generous.<//Text>

I got a mango & cream smoothie. The smoothie was good. The problem was the whipped cream. Instead of using real whied cream, made with heavy whipping cream they used some cheep, waxy imitation stuff. Blew the whole deal. And it really was a good smoothie otherwise. MomABear< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Worst restaurant I’ve been to. My food tasted really bad so I politely sent it back knowing that they might charge me for it. The server came to me to make sure I knew that nothing was wrong with the food and that she’s gonna charge me for it so I said that’s fine. Then she comes back and asks if I need anything instead which I thought was very thoughtful. When the bill arrived, I noticed that she charged me for both dishes! I was shocked so I went up to her to ask, and she said “oh no, you didn’t expect me to give you both dishes for free? It’s not my fault you didn’t like it” needless to say, it was a very bad experience</Review>< Date>

The burgers are so yummy. I had a cheese and avocado burger with a side salad that has me thinking about it four days later, which is why I am taking the time to write this! Go here! The family that owes this is super sweet as well.< /text>

Chipotle Benedict - delicious unique take on a Benedict.  The sauce comes on the side and had a nice kick to it.  Highly recommended. I asked for extra crispy potatoes and they definitely delivered. Crispy outside and tender inside.

Chicken Sandwich - Very flavorfully marinated chicken on herbed focaccia, added bacon and was served with 3 generous slices. Fries were solid as well.

Highly recommended!  Got a seat right away for 2 at 1pm on Sunday.  The service staff was nice as well. Enjoy!<//Text>

They have great breakfast food! I like to grab one of their omelettes and GARLIC FRIES. I like to get it togo, but I have to warn you they will refuse your togo order when they are busy. Just make sure it's at a slow time. Overall, I haven't had any complaints!</text>

Mellow vibes in this quiet restaurant by the beach. The waitress always has a smile on her face, welcoming all who walk in. Unassuming, straight forward, and consistency are it's strengths. Chipotle Benedict, chorizo and eggs, and the fish sandwich are my favs. Drop in for a quick and affordable meal.<//Review>

We ended up here by accident as we actually came to the area to go to Outerlands (also reviewed). Outerlands had along line up so we came across the street to the Sea Breeze. On first appearance we weren't sure whether we wanted to eat here as the atmosphere and decor of the interior was was a bit below our liking. However, it was getting later in the afternoon and we did not want to go elsewhere. We were very glad we made the decision to stay as the food was terrific and the service was fast, attentive and friendly. The Outerlands is a bit more upscale in appearance and the food is a bit more inventive but we would definitely stop at Sea Breeze again.</review>

Who likes waiting in line for overpriced brunch menu items at Outerlands? Everybody who comes in and dines here. Just kidding, the food is great and I love their chipotle benedicts! This place also has great value and you're not spending $20 on one breakfast item *cough* Beachside Coffee Bar & Kitchen *cough*< /text>

my ex and i have been coming here for 5 years; at times, every weekend. that ended today when a friend of mine and I went to eat there on sunday. at noon we sat down. at 1215 we ordered. we got our food over an HOUR later...and it wasn't even busy. the owner, whom i have known this 5 years, was asked if he was going to comp our meal and his reply? "just come back mid-week; i'll buy you a beer." thanks joe, but that doesn't quite make up for HORRIBLE service, excuses, nonsense and $38 for benedicts. my friend, my ex, and i will NEVER darken the door of this place again. if you have a choice of where to go for brunch, as much as the food is ok, consider outerlands or park chalet instead. never had a problem with either of those. dear seabreeze....thanks a loaf for the past 5 years and a ABYSMAL last visit.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) We had breakfast in this place. From the outside it is very characteristic and the interior is no less important, particularly as regards the paintings hanging on the walls. Breakfast is typical america: eggs, bacon and potatoes. We also took the pancakes that were whole-grain and a cappuccino that did not regret the Italian ones. The owner is very kind and welcoming. Super recommended.

I loved this set up, what a great idea having games avaliable to play while enjoying a glass of wine, or beer. And the hi top tables are perfect for the board games, and cards. The service is outstanding. I just found this place, and will diffenetly being going often.<//Review>

Not a typical dive bar. Ritzy looking place but kind of ackward atmosphere. When I arrived it was a paint night and kind of quiet. Lots of potential with the right crowd and music< /Text>

Decided to give this place a try and don't regret it. The beer selection was good and the inside was very nice. Highly recommend this establishment if you're wanting to go somewhere with friends on a day off! Workers are polite and have you feeling comfortable.<//Text>

The vibes here are unbeatable, it’s like they put their bartenders through an intensive test to make sure they’re super genuinely awesome people lol. I honestly hate going out at all nowadays because of the lack of good service but this place is incredible. ALWAYS a blast. My favorite spot in the HD and IE 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼< /review>

My favorite place in the whole vville, avalley, hesperia area. They care about craft beer and wine selection and love being a place that brings community together. Games and hot bar snacks available. Perfect spot to stop in for a beverage after work, or for date night or just hanging with friends. Made some new friends here too! I've moved away and this is the only spot I miss.< /review>

This is my second time using this facility. I had a great first experience with Megan and my second experience with Tamika is exceptional. She’s down to earth, customer service forward and friendly, knowledgeable and made my experience coming back to Public Storage seamless. I highly recommend this facility. It’s clean, secure, and easy to navigate.</review>

Being a tenant here this past year has been excellent. After a death in the family and a newborn I found myself needing additional storage, in a hurry.

Tamika and Zuri bent over backwards to quickly accommodate my needs. So thankful for these folks.< /Review>

< Review>
The storage units themselves are decent and clean, but definitely a bit overpriced depending on time of year (I took it regardless cause this was the closest storage unit to my house). The customer service on the other hand, absolutely horrendous, by the older lady at the reception. On the multiple occasions I went to the location, I met 4 separate individuals working there, 3 of which were extremely nice and courteous, but this older lady was absolutely horrendous and rude, was always on the phone and was completely unhelpful, regularly passing snarky comments, rolling her eyes, shouting and sometimes straight up ignoring my questions. I wish I could remember her name, sadly I can't and I have no desire to go back to this pace to find out. Might do business with Public Storage again, but definitely never with this location.</Review>

I had a wonderful experience with Tamika and Nikita at Berkeley Public storage. They helped me get a storage unit in no time at all. They were extremely busy, especially with all the new students coming into town, and they remained professional, patient and friendly. Thank you Tamika and Nikita.< /text>

<rate>2</rate><Review>i have rented a 10x30 unit at this location for over five years.  The storage facility is adequate and the staff is generally helpful.  However, new customers should be aware of their practice of penalizing long-term renters with ridiculously large rate hikes, far in excess of inflation or the market rates for new contracts.  The rent on my unit was initially $392/mo in February 2014.  It is now $811/mo.  Meanwhile, new customers are paying around $500 for similar units.  I cannot recommend this business to anyone who foresees a long-term storage need.  These are the kinds of rate increases you can expect if you rent a storage space here:
2/14: $392
7/14: $461
7/15: $512
7/16: $579
7/17: $643
7/18: $727

Such an awesome experiencing visiting this store. Buying supplies and inquiring on storage units for some items that I need to store after my move. Nikita provided me with A1 customer service! She was knowledable, kind, resourceful, and answered all my questions. 🤩 I would most definitely recommend my family and friends to visit this facility for any of their future storage needs or supplies.

I don’t write recommendations often but we had the best experience with Tamika and Amber yesterday. Getting a storage unit can be stressful (especially with a cross-country move) but they made the experience easy. It was like we were doing business with family.<//Review>

Tamika was super helpful, as always. I actually have 2 storage units here and it's not the closest to my home or work. I am a loyal customer at this Public Storage facility (the one closer to Target Albany.) She's on point with all helpful information about the units and availability. The facilities are clean and climate controlled. I was in and out for my second unit in 15 minutes. I highly recommend this storage   location to anyone!</review>

<Review>I stored most of my furniture, clothes and appliances here this summer when staying away from school for vacation. Zodi and Nikita were friendly and professional enough, and the place was very clean. Climate control worked well and all my stuff were in good condition when I took them back. I have to say the price is on the slightly expensive side but I got nothing else to complain about.</Review>< date>

<review>I visited several different self-storage facilities in the East Bay before choosing Public Storage on 2nd Street in Berkeley. This facility is clean and well lit.  Zuri, Nikita and Tamika were friendly and professional. They all were very helpful in assisting and answering my questions. They made the rental process pleasantly easy, especially Zuri, who also helped me select the right storage unit size and indoor location.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80857ed4f02a960d:0x3553039a0f32a7c0<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I came to this location at a time in my life that was way beyond hectic. I was greeted by Cheryl and Tamika. I found these 2 ladies to be most informative and to make it all better, this place is spotless.  I appreciate their attention to detail and most importantly their desire to make me feel at ease.   If you need storage, LOOK NO FURTHER!  This is your place.<//Review>< response>

I had to find a storage unit at the last minute and landed at this location. The staff we simply the best. I came in just a few minutes before closing and felt terrible. The two women working that night we super helpful and didn't rush to get me out the door at all. Took their time to show me everything in detail. Tamika is the best!

Also the units are very very clean. Always a cart when you need one. And i have even met a couple of my "neighbors" who also seem very cool.

I am 100% happy with the decision to keep all my crap i just can't bring myself to get rid of here. THANK YOU!</Text>

My rental went great and quick. Property manager Tamika was very efficient, and professional. When we retuned to the office I got the pleasure of talking to Daniel and Steve. Everyone was great! Oh and I 1st spoke to Property Manager Megan at 620 Harrison st as well and she was great. She showed me multiple spaces and answered all my questions. Thanks PS!<//review>

< Review>
We had a pleasant experience with Milan, because she helped with getting us the best deal possible with the unit size we wanted. She showed us a couple of units and was patient the entire time. What we liked most about her service was how she responded to the influx of customers while she serviced us. She didn't rush us to get to the other customers; instead, she politely told the other customers someone will be with them shortly, and continued on with us. She didn't brush the other customers off, but she also didn't ignore them, which was nice. She had also helped other customers along the way, as she showed us the available units. What was nice was she asked if it was okay to help them out (!),  then thanked us for sharing her with other customers. That's awesome service.</Review>

Solid recommendation. The facilities and the employees are top notch. Use the on-line system for the best rate options. The ladies who run this location are amazing and their customer service is like being at a 5-star hotel. Access is automated by codes, facilities are spotless, security looks extensive, location is ideal for Berkeley and northward.<//text>

<Review>If you need to find a storage facility in the bay area,  this is the place.  The team here are all on the same page and have outstanding customer service. The manager, Tamika is a friendly, professional person and I am grateful she is in charge.  When I had a question, she was immediately there to help me.  Her team is a reflection of her when she is not there.  I feel confident my belongings are safe and secure.  I picked the best place to store my stuff! I recommend 2nd Street PUBLIC STORAGE!!</Review>< Pics>

I'm a first time storage renter and I was looking for a reasonable price and great review. I checked Yelp and saw great reviews about this place, I was going for the smallest space they have which is cheaper than the one I decided to go for but it's was small and requires me to lift stuff. Since I didn't want to do that I went with the 5 by 5 space. With all this, Brittany was awesome, she made sure I had the right space for my needs. Great customer service, the whole stuff including Brittany, Maya, Tamika( Property Manager, Michelle are pleasant and friendly. Thank you guys for your help😃</review>

< Review>
Terrible overall experience. First of all the initial payment for the first month came out to 50% more than the stated monthly price due to hidden fees such as processing fees and mandatory insurance. I then came in the next day asking if I could get a refund because I no longer needed the storage unit. They told me that they could not give me one which was fine. Several days later they called and said they were in the process of refunding me. However, at this point I did not want the refund because the truck I was going to use to move was no longer available to me. Then 8 days after I started the lease they told me I was behind on a payment. I called them to see what they meant by that and they said I needed to pay $3.60, which must have been an error on their end. Normally a fee of this much would not be a big deal but I was not able to make the payment online because the online account did not recognize my email address despite the fact that they had been communicating with me with the exact email I entered. I called the helpline on their website to get assistance but there was nothing they could do so the only way I could make a payment was to go down to the storage yard in person which was far from where I was living and extremely inconvenient. My overall experience was very negative and I will never use public storage again.< /Review>

Tameka and Steve were awesome. I really appreciate how they went above and beyond to meet my customer service needs. Every time I call Public Storage for questions I usually get Tameka and she always has the same pleasant, do what she can attitude to fulfill my request. In a day and age where customer service is usually very low this public storage facility stands out like a beacon of light. Thank you guys for being of great service.<//text>

This review is in two parts. First for the corporate side and second for the staff who works on site.

Part One: Corporate
Zero Stars

The first thing you should know about Public Storage is BE PREPARED FOR LARGE FEE INCREASES!

They don't even have the decency to wait a year. Four months after they lure you in with a Bait & Switch con they will raise your fees. A lot.

I spend tens of thousands of dollars a year at this facility and corporate cares ZERO for customer loyalty. Know that you will be treated like a dupe once they get you signed up.

Also, once you are a loyal customer they won't let you leave mid month. So if you stay one hour past the last day of the month they charge you for the entire month. They used to pro-rate but no longer. Just another way to be scummy and money grab. Pretty sad way to do business.

Part 2
Excellent staff! Five Stars!

Many thanks to Kevin, Tamika, Brittnee and the team who have all gone above and beyond to be extra helpful to me. Their commitment to customer service is THE BEST. Many thanks.

**This part of the review is only for the staff, the policies of the corporation are far less satisfactory. If not for the friendly and engaged people working here I would have taken my storage business elsewhere long ago.<//review>

Location, location, location in real estate is everything. I'm happy that this storage space was expanded by the bay a few years ago, God knew what I could afford. And, I am thankful it's been staffed with people like Tamika who appear to care about Public Storage's corporate culture and my business too! Thanks to Steve for the opportunity to be fair here, it appears ownership has a need for continuing its efforts of fairness in serving America's diversity.</Text>

I have to say that I received excellent service from this Public Storage location.  Brittany, Tai, and Tamika quickly processed the application and explained everything very clearly... from the charges and locks to hours of operation and how to get in and out of the property.

Our climate controlled storage space was clean and easy to access.

I'd use this facility again if I needed temporary storage.</review>

I've had great experience with the current management of this facility.  Art, the manager, has been really helpful in identifying a new unit that would best fit my needs, and coordinating anything Public Storage needed to do for a successful move!  And almost all of the staff I've interacted with have been focused on smooth, thoughtful customer service.

Thanks so much!<//review>

<Review>This was my first time using a storage unit and I was very satisfied with this place. Since the day I went to rent the storage unit everyone was very helpful, the unit and the building was very clean, and I felt comfortable storing my contents there. Overall I was very satisfied and would definitely recommend this place not only for the excellent storage units, but for the customer service.</Review>< pics>

I have never used storage before and really didn't think there was much to it. When I got to the facility it was clean and the employees were helpful. The manager who helped me was Art and was very helpful and patient, he showed me a couple different sizes after he asked me just what I was storing and explaining how to put it in there like a puzzle to utilize the space to get in the smallest space possible. He did offer to get me loaded up on boxes but they seemed a bit much. I will say they do like to stay in touch with their customers as I got a bunch of calls until I answered to first come in and rent the space and a couple reminder calls that the rent is due. I guess it's not that bothersome since the phone calls are friendly and just trying to do their job. As much of a great experience it has been, it's still an extra bill I could do without :-)</review>

<text>Overall, I've had a very good experience with this Public Storage. I access the facility frequently because I store some work supplies with my personal stuff -- I'm probably here a few times a week on average. The facility is newer and seems secure -- gate and elevator codes restrict access. The generous access hours are important to me since I often need something at odd hours. The staff is always courteous and recognize me. All the staff is great but Arthur and Ben have always stood out as engaging and interested to help when needed. You have to drop off an ID to get a cart which is a minor inconvenience but since it means that people don't walk off with them or hoard them, it' a small price to pay. And, the urinal in the restroom flushes for a long time. Other than that, the place is excellent.  Super easy access from the freeway and Gilman.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80857ed4f02a960d:0x3553039a0f32a7c0<//gmap_id></record>

I was there to buy packing supplies and the service and friendly attitude at the 2nd st public storage in Berkeley was amazing! Everyone in the office were super helpful and made a routine trip a pleasure. Milan was the main person helping me, but two others loaded the car and retrieved all my supplies. I will definitely  be going back. I wish more businesses had employees with this level of service- really great.<//review>

Rent has almost doubled in 6 years. Think about that. Inflation 2-3% in that timeframe. Same with wages. But rent increases by 90%. Obscene.</review>

Tamika was on point with everything!

Provides excellent customer service and fulfilled my request to change storage sizes in a very friendly and professional manner.

Would recommend this public storage facility to anyone looking for a great customer service!

I found this location when I was stressed about having to move out of one house before I could start moving into my new place. I signed up for 1 month which with insurance and admin fees was a super deal at $32. JeVonne, Tamika, and Milan were beyond wonderful. Not only were they incredibly friendly and helpful they were also very caring and sweet. The unit itself was nice and clean in a locked inside bottom floor, there's no light in the unit itself but the hall light is more than enough for me as I wont be in in very long. I would recommend hands down this facility!!< /Text>

My mom and I had a great experience today, our first time going to this Public Storage facility on 2nd St. in Berkeley.  Loretta helped us view and learn about different storage units.  Although she has only worked there 3 weeks, she had the answers to all our questions, gave good suggestions, and is clearly a smart, personable and capable young woman.  We booked a unit with confidence.</text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>This location is awful!  I'm guessing they give people discounts for all these high reviews.  I saw people walk in with their proverbially hat in their hands begging to let them have their belongings back, as they tried to make a late payment.  Public Storage kept everything they owned.  It was sad and heart breaking to see. I thought it would never happen to me.  Then after being late on my payment they kept all my stuff including a comic book collection worth several thousand dollars and all my life's work of art work made from childhood on.  : (  I will not forgive them as long as I live.  I DO NOT reccomend this location or this company.  I begged them to get my stuff.  My advice: Go to a mom and pop storage .  If there isn't one start one.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Can't sing the praises of Shasta enough--she solved a rather sticky system error that had my account non-existent in the system and my payment untraceable. Without her, my space could have been rented and my stuff on the street without me knowing. She went above and beyond to make sure the whole issue was resolved and, with her manager Migdalia, compensated me for the mistake. She's a gem. I would recommend this storage facility to anyone looking just for Shasta alone. Thank you again Shasta!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Awful! Rude and uncaring costumer service. I made a full reservation online and I was told the space was ready to use. When I showed up wit all my stuff ready to use the storage the bill  was higher. If not enough, they force you buy their insurance and their lock at super inflated prices. If you don't want to pay you are told you can leave. I long for the days when companies and costumer service in the US were polite and honest.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

The best storage facility in the Bay Area. In forty years, I have never found better facilities or better service. I would whole-hardheartedly recommend this particular Public Storage facility. Ask for Arthur or Jevonne.< /review>

Your employees at public storage on 2nd st were very nice and they really work with the customers but the district manager, Rick was very unprofessional. I, as a customer, called him for 3 days, twice each day and he didnt respond until i left a nasty voicemail. But again your employees were very professional at their job.</text>

My first time renting a storage space (I'm a "senior") and am so pleased I chose Public Storage on 2nd St.,Berkeley!  The customer service from Tamika, Cheryl and Sabrina was superlative - businesslike yet compassionate, and they gave me an "un-pressured" feeling.  The cleanliness, order and care of their whole site operation really shows.  I highly recommend them.<//review>

<text>First of all the staff, Jaymes, Tamika and Shamaya were great. Facility clean, well lit, elevator works etc.  Taking off one pt for shady characters hanging out & bothering legit renters. More than once I was accosted and nearly in a fight with ppl clearly off their meds. Once it happened when Jaymes was there and he swung into action protecting me without being a jerk to the messed up homeless lady hassling me. Jaymes is cool and I appreciated his intervention. Go only during office hours and you should be ok.</text>< Time>

Tamika gave me awesome customer service. Even though I came late to the facility, I didn't feel rushed. I recommend this public storage to anyone in need.<//Review>

Tried to sell my stuff, thinking I hadn't paid my rent...they were wrong.  Items missing, wood table broken.  Gave me a hard time, never compensated me.  Evidence of rodents when I cleared out my stuff.  So glad to be out of that nasty place.<//Review>

They have something for everyone. Circuit training, brand new machines, massage, all for $19.99 a month. Also personal training in group setting and all access for $55 total a month flat fee. Ask for Jose . Watch out for bait n switch tactics. Although their $19.99 a month membership says it includes group classes, you'll come to discover after you've paid in full that there are no group classes cause they cancelled them, yet they took your money already and then they try to upsell you on Evo Fit classes that has its own membership and you have to pay for it separately. The gym definitely has a mismanagement issue which creates miscommunication and confusion for the customers.< /text>

<Text>They know your name and always are friendly. There are many many machines so you don't have to wait to use any of them. They have at least three circuits of similar machines but different manufactures so you can change it up anytime.

I would NOT recommend establishing a gym membership at the Fit Republic, in Atascadero. They need to better train their manager's at handling customer's escalated issues, also returning phone calls, especially when they promise to do so, as well as establishing proper training that includes reciting their rules over the telephone, to those looking to renew their memberships. I have concluded Fit Republic is neither upfront nor honest about their "rules," that pertain to membership cancellations/refunds.

Originally, I had signed up for a year long membership, prior to changing the name, and hiring new management at the facility. Overall (aside from their music selection) I was pleased and personally had no issues, although plenty of people I know personally and professionally, had several bad experiences mostly pertaining to having their checking accounts debited repeatedly for months after they left the gym.

Once my membership had expired, the gym employee that I spoke to via telephone, insisted that I pay for their one year membership upfront, for the best rate possible. He failed to inform me of a single disclaimer, like I would be forfeiting all of my money if I cancelled my membership.

Unexpectedly I recently moved to the coast. So, while running errands one day, I entered into the gym to speak to management about receiving a refund for the remaining months I could no longer use for I was no longer able to attend their gym. The new female manager informed me there were no refunds. I explained that I was never told this important information over the telephone. The staff should have recited this prior to the renewal process. I was quite upset to find out only after the fact that they were already paid in full. I was then told she would call me back in a few weeks after she spoke to the gym owner directly, for guidance.

It is now February. I have yet to receive any sort of refund or a single phone call as promised.

I decided to call the gym, 5 days ago but there was no answer. I left a message including my name, phone number, and requested a phone call back. I have yet to hear back from the manager that I spoke to originally months ago or from a staff member.

All and all, it feels like I have fallen victim to a scam. This incident shows true unprofessionalism, through and through.

I expect a refund for the several months I had remaining or some sort of solution from the owner. They could allow me to transfer the rest of my membership time of 7 months to a family member or friend living in town. Rather I am just being ignored.<//Text>

Great place for casual workouts, workout routines, even just a quick one with a nice stint on the water massage chair at the end. They have wifi, TV, classes you can sign up for, water fountains, it's clean and safe, love this place, probably my favorite gym. AND it's inexpensive. I ended my 4 year membership at Kennedy after doing a walk-through here and haven't had a second thought.< /Review>

< Review>
Personal training is contracted out by a third party, it is not provided in-house. I paid up-front for 2 days/week (first and last month) and was told no one was "available" for month of October and they made no effort to find a replacement. I was charged $320 for October and for the following month. I ended up cancelling my membership and they have yet to reimburse me. The owner does not work with you because of third party. I am out over $600. What a rip-off! Stay away....< /Review>

<userid>110105775568437692707< /userid><text>I recently signed up and had a very awkward sign up. I went in thinking I would put ten dollars down and that would be that. I ended up being informed it be a few dollars every month just to process my card, then ten dollars and a few other fees throughout the year. The guy trying to sell me the membership signed me up on the premium so that there would not be any start up fees. Jump forward to this evening. I come in like normal and the lady informs me I have 3 months worth of extra charges and that if I don't pay they will send my account to collections. I argued about the credit card fee and either blatantly lied about the company eating the cost to process or she did not know that credit card processing companies charge a small percentage per transaction amount. Once done discussing the credit card fees, she said something akin to this isn't free. You know you have to pay. After saying I'd be back the next evening to settle this she mentioned that if I didn't pay soon they'd send my account to collections. In any case I'm strongly considering letting my account go into collections before they see another dollar from me. I implore you too seek another gym. It hurts to write this review because I've been a fitness fan for the past 4 years and have never been in such an awkward bind with a gym.<//text>< Rating>

<text>I have a few friends that go here and they only have nice things to say so I'm going to check this place out. I haven't signed up or even been there yet. But I decided to check out the reviews on it to see what everybody says and I'm not liking everything I'm reading. So for now the 3 star is just neutral. I'll write my review after I try it out.< /text><GmapID>0x80ece9c66929102d:0x6e516d92b8954186</GmapID>< name>

<Review>I been a member since before the gym even opened. I called to speak to a manager to see if there was a way I would be able to downgrade my membership since I was paying for a higher membership which includes classes and the HydroMassage. I honestly don't attend any of the classes or use the HydroMassage, which is why I wanted to downgrade. After speaking with a manager over the phone he asked me to come in and speak to him in person to discuss  and see what he can do for me. He had me thinking it would be possible to downgrade without paying the fee. He then had one of his employees take care of me and charge me the fee, which was a little upsetting because we didn't discuss anyting. I honestly should have just cancelled my membership. I probably would have been charged the same fee I was charged to cancel that I was to downgrade.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

This is the worst gym ever!!! Me and my husband have tried to cancel our membership for months now and I am still getting charged!!!! $17.99 on 7/31/2017 and then charged again $12.99 on 8/16/2017. My husband called and cancelled for the both of us, two months later they still charging us. When  we call they say that he can't cancel for me , his wife, I have to cancel myself. Why did they not tell us when he called the first time. My husband has tried to cancel multiple times by calling and going in.  Where do these f@#king charges even coming from!!!!  We signed up when they opened, it was $9.99. Everytime we ask them to email us are contract and our cancellation notice they claim they do, but we have never received anything. It just never ends.... AVOID this place!!!! They just take, and take and continue to take your money!!< /text>

<review>Response:
What would be the point of emailing you I've already done that and spoken to you on a few occasions as well as your manager in Santa Maria I was assured by you on at least two occasions that the check was in the mail so what would be the point it is clear to me that you lie and your staff do nothing but lie

I would not recommend this gym to anyone I purchased a package right before they opened for an entire year up front. A few months later I scheduled an appointment with the trainer, who cancelled my appointment as I was walking in the door and didn't bother calling me to cancel my appointment. I later rescheduled my appointment I was recommended to take a class I was told that because I had money on my account that I would not incur any additional fees  for at least the next 3 months.
But exactly 15 days later I had $88 removed from my bank account . I tried to speak to the manager in Atascadero and was unsuccessful so I then spoke with the owner and was told that the money would be refunded via check as they could electronically refund and here we are two and a half months later and I still haven't gotten a dime back.<//review>< username>

I canceled my membership three months ago and now this gym owes me $50.00. I talked to a manager after the first month and was told this would be refunded. This did not happen and then I was charged again $24.99. I then went into the office where the sweet gal at the desk was unable to help but I was told I would get a call back. I just want to warn you that this gym has caused me more headache than anything else. Hope they contact me soon to get this handled. :(<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Great place to workout! Updated my review September 2017. Seems like they have lost a lot of trainers since I first started going. Had an appointed canceled on me without notice, then found out because the trainer was no longer there. Don't offer any classes but the Evo Fit classes now.

<Review>i was going to Evo Fit for almost a year. I went in one day last month and it turns out they had changed their name to Fit Republic. No one sent me a letter or an email or anything saying they were changing anything. i was signed up for the larger package for 19.99 a month, which included the tanning bed and water massage chair, which i only cared about the tanning. it turns out when they changed their name they removed the tanning beds, but continued to charge me for that service without notification for 3 months. of course i was upset about this, and asked about downgrading my membership to the basic. they said if i down grade i would have to pay a $49 fee. i said how much to cancel then, and they said free. so i decided to cancel. this was about 1 week after i had paid my membership, so they said i could actually continue to use the gym until the end of the month. now it is the following month, and i was just charged AGAIN. i called down to ask about the charge, and the person that answered was very rude and just kept repeating- "there's a 30 day notice, there's a 30 day notice. so you can use the gym for the rest of this month and you wont get charged again, but there's a 30 day notice." OMG i am so done with this place!< /Review><rating>1<//rating><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

<Text>The hydromassage isn't as good as a real massage but to have daily access to it is worth the price of membership alone.

The manager is a super friendly guy.<//Text><user_id>114257864500549963296< /user_id><resp>None</resp><rate>4<//rate>< pictures>

<Text>This is the worse gym I have ever been to. They have taken money from my account long after I had cancelled mine and my boyfriend's account. And just recently taken more and put me in debt. I will never ever recommend this gym to anyone. And if that wasn't enough, what they say is part of you membership fees is a lie. Everything is extra, they are constantly overcharging.<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating><gmapID>0x80ece9c66929102d:0x6e516d92b8954186<//gmapID><username>bethany holt<//username>< date>

<Text>Honestly don't understand the reviews for this one.  I've been to many gyms in my 44 years on the planet.  A ton, in fact.  I would say easily I've been to about 50 in California, Hawaii, and Canada. I'm currently a member of FitRepublic (before they were Fitness Evolution) in Monterey and Watsonville.  Hands down this is one of the nicest and newest REAL gyms I've been to.  Way better than my local FitRepublics.

You go to a gym to work out.  I don't need a racquetball court, massage therapist, a snack bar, cocktail bar, blah blah blah.  Just give me working equipment in good condition, clean areas, good spacing, and a cheap price, and I'm super happy.  This place has all that and is brand spanking new.  I wish they had wifi access, though.  But, can't complain.  First and only visit, my wife and I were super impressed.< /Text>< Response>

The gym was not terribly bad besides the fact that the staff was trying to oversell their membership. Advertised $9.99 will pretty much get you nowhere. I wanted to be able to attend group classes and ended up paying  $39.99 a month. I cancelled my membership in May since I was relocating to Southern California. The front desk associate had me sign the form on their computer and refused to provide the copy explaining that they aren't able to print anything from the front desk computer. I was explained that since they require a 30 day notice, I will be still charged for the month of June. I checked my credit card statement and discovered that I'm still being charged for the membership in August! I called the gym three times before I was able to speak with a manager. I'm being told that they are showing me cancelling the membership in the month of July, which is completely impossible since I haven't left So Cal since June,1. I was told that their corporate office is working on resolving the issue and getting the refund but I haven't heard anything at all. This place is a scam, and if you happen to do any business with them, have them PRINT EVERY SINGLE FORM FOR YOU! Don't believe in their excuses, they will find a thousand more excuses not to refund you. If they say that they can't print a form, take a picture on your phone. Learn on my mistake and on mistakes of many others as you can see from the reviews.

Update: I happened to visit SLO past weekend and decided to stop by at EvoFit on 9/16 and see their manager. Once I asked for a manager, the guy named Johny stated that he is a new manager but he's not on a clock and just walked out. He wouldn't even listen to what the issue was, just went to work out. The front desk lady took my information and promised that Johny would call me back Monday. I haven't heard back from anybody. It figures! Johny, Johny, there is no such a thing as a manager on a clock. If you run a place, you run it even you happened to simply work out there. This is not how tou start your management career! Very unprofessional.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80ece9c66929102d:0x6e516d92b8954186<//Gmap_id><UserId.>102466102644043382849< /UserId.>< resp>

<text>Everytime i go there isn't any soap or toilet paper in the women's bathroom. When i ask the janitor Elizabeth to refill it, she says she will and never does. Most of the time she is nowhere to be found. It's very unprofessional to not have things stocked when that janitor is suppose to be there all day.</text>< pictures>

I have arrived at the gym at 5:00 a.m twice in the last week, and the gym has been closed! It is simply unacceptable for a business to not be open during posted business hours, especially at 5 a.m.!<//Review>

The hot dogs are 100% beef, and didn't have the metalic taste of nitrates, although I did not confirm their absence with the owner.  There is all outdoor seating with lovely views of flowers and the Sacramento River.

Fantastic food & service. However, know that my wife  and I are in our 60s. We ware a mask. They, Dinky Diner, need to simply post a big sign at both service windows, for those Boneheads that won't. Staff inside ware them. Masks protect others. There's enough outside seating to be away from others safely. Great beef & veggie burgers!<//Review>

The food is your standard burger fair, but it directly overlooks the river.. Amazing.  Plus they have a veg burger.  There's a brewery and multiple wineries in the immediate proximity.  I highly recommend making a stop here< /text>

< Review>
Great burgers with a lovely view. The onion rings were delicious as well. Burger had great charring on the edges, onion rings were crisp and flavorful. There is a sign in the window that says "This is not fast food...", which is true, however, it is worth the wait and you honestly won't mind waiting if you can grab a seat at the long counter overlooking the river and just watch the water go by. Great place to grab a bite after doing some tasting at the Old Sugar Mill!< /Review>

Great food here.  It has a classic menu with burgers and fries and the like.  The location is excellent. You can enjoy your food while taking in the cool delta breeze and watching the Sacramento river flow by.  The only drawback of this place is that it is open only a few days a week.<//Review>

Accessible by boat, but land North of diner about 1000 feet.  You will see a large number of rocks.  There is no "nice" dockage available to the public.  Do not land at the marina, it is private property.

Veggieburger.  Quaint, picturesque, and sure to inspire sharing a related story.

Take a plastic bag with you and pick up a little trash where you beach to help retain landing privileges.

I am surprised the local cafe's, art studios, and shopping businesses haven't built a public pay by the hour dock to bring in business.

Retirees travel in groups, and have the largest disposable income of any demographic.  They love their boats.</review>

What a fun little "food truck (well, trailer)" semi-permanently installed at the Clarksburg "marina." Friendly staff, tasty fare (burgers and fries, sodas and shakes). Have a bite overlooking the Sacramento River!< /Review>

<Review>Burgers were alright but small, French fries were crunchy but tasted a tad bit like fish. The drink is a canned soda. No restroom, OK view, OK food,  not worth $11 for a combo.</Review></record>

<text>I have been a regular since 2016. At that time, Walter Wong and company were the best around for European cars. But a few years ago Walter WOng left. And so did a lot of the regular, tried and true mechanics. Since then, I the turnover has been alarming. While the staff has seemed competent,  I have lost faith. And sadly, due to my lack of mechanical expertise, faith is all I have to go on. So, the other day I needed a headlight bulb replaced. The current "front of the house" mechanic who I had never seen before ( and I was just there a  less than 6 months before) advised me that the  bulb replacement would take at least 2 hours, would most likely require removing panels and bumpers.... so I did more research. And in 20 minutes, with a friends support, I replaced the bulb WITHOUT REMOVING ANYTHING.  Speechless. I have spent thousands, literally, at this shop. I may need a different solution. Sorry folks.< /text>< pics>

<text>Basically just ask for Walter. This guy is fair and very knowledgeable. Example: My RPM gauge moves up and down while in park (P). He gave me two possibilities that would fix this problem but suggested the lower cost option instead of the most expensive for my Porsche. Plus today he was $110 cheaper for a routine oil change than the dealer. A++.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2b982b254639f:0xad4210d240a998cb<//gmapID>< Rate>

Sadly there's nothing to do to save the transmission (short of replacing it) but, since they weren't able to do any work, they didn't even charge for the diagnostic!
Super great and friendly team and would recommend anyone going here!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1603743997958, 'text': 'Thanks for the feed back Keith.'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b982b254639f:0xad4210d240a998cb<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Have been bringing all my cars here for close to 5 years and have always been extremely happy with the service. This last time was like going to a completely different place - not sure if ownership changed or what happened but the service was chaotic, my car door had greasy fingerprints on it when I picked it up. I wasn't confident that my oil had been changed and I also brought my car in for check engine service light. After picking my car up and driving home, the car stalled on me and the check engine service light came on. Will not be returning.< /Text>

This business is engaged in a very deceptive practice to the point of ripping parts brought from a dealership. They punish a customer simply because a customer brings their own part. I brought  valve cover gasket from a Hyundai dealership because I wanted to have an original part and they ripped it on purpose. It is horrific. They also ripped a fuel pump gasket. I had previous incident too. This business must be shut down. I will also report them to the Better Business Bureaue and the Automotive repair and beyond. I will persue it further.  Very dishonest people .<//review>

We did not rip any parts why would we ? we are here to service the cars and repair them . The packages where opened right in front of you, I checked them for quality since you brought them from other source .Weather it's the dealer or a aftermarket place we have to check them, One had a tear and the other was crimped. I understand your frustration but misleading information doesn't help fix the situation. Allow us to rectify this miscommunication between us. Come in let's sit and take care of the situation, Hope to hear from you\n-Management Team at Your Right Solution Inc."}<//Response>

<review>I visited multiple shops in L.A. in an attempt to find a trustworthy mechanic. Look no further, Walter and his team are professional, honest, and respectful - I even received a follow-up text to make sure I was satisfied. I can't remember the last time a mechanic asked me to come down to the shop to see exactly which parts required repair. Thank you, Your Right Solution.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>The owner Walter will walk you through the likely problems under the car pointing them out as you move along.  He compiles a list and then prioritizes the list based on your needs or requests.  The process is transparent.  Because they are busy, you will find yourself waiting a bit but no more than ten minutes at a time.  They work in the order that customers arrive.  They do not make appointments.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I was about the sell my car to Cash for Cars, and Walter came and fixed it in 5 minutes: now the car is up and running! I recommend them greatly: they are really honest and hardworking people. I also bought a car to them and never had a problem. Every time I bring it, they explain everything, they are really transparent. The best garage for Saab cars!<//text>

<Review>I'M NEVER GOING ANYWHERE ELSE AGAIN! Walter is the greatest mechanic and man I've met. He did a thorough inspection of my engine and quoted me a price. Because he said other places could do it cheaper so he looked up a place that could save me money. Then he called the place, gave them all of the info, bargained with them to get the cheapest price and everything. Walter truly treated me like family. He broke down everything I had to do and say on the phone for future calls and held my experienced hand all the way through the process. At the end of the day, he did all that for free because it was a free inspection. Give this man all of your money.</Review><time>1470696156304<//time><user_id>118414353053261740558< /user_id><name>Jason Walton<//name></record>

Went in for my 2007 Subaru Forester -

Walter, who runs the shop, is great and personable. He offered multiple practical solutions to my car problems and was patient in explaining them to me. My conversation with him was two people talking about a machine, as opposed to a salesman talking about some mysterious, potentially dangerous entity (as is often the case at repair shops). He understands that good business is built through honesty and good customer relations, not scaring the customer into immediate action, and I really appreciated that. It also doesn't hurt that he's a family man and that his shop has personality to it.

In terms of price, they are extremely competitive. In terms of quality, they are very experienced.

Very highly recommend Right Solution --< /Text>

Love this place! The owner is very professional, honest and intelligent. The prices are fair and the employees move fast to get your car fixed right and in great time. Will be bringing my car here again in the future. PLUS they have FREE pre-purchase inspections! Unlike other places that charge 100 bucks just to look at your vehicle. Highly recommended coming here!< /Review>

<name>Hannah Shidler</name><Text>Right Solution is THE Saab mechanic shop of LA. They've taken care of me and my Saab(s) for years. I stopped in for my routine oil change a month or so ago, and they noted that my brakes/rotors were due to be changed as well as a minor hose leak that needed to be fixed. They gave me a price quote for all the work. I came back a few weeks later to get the work done, and they dropped the original quote price by 10%, AND they were able to get all the work done (including ordering and picking up parts) within a few hours. I couldn't imagine taking my beloved Saab anywhere else.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Walter Wong is a no nonsense professional. He's an internationally respected Saab expert and good ole mechanic. He takes the time to explain every option to solve your car woes.

<Text>I would stay away from this place if your looking for an honest mechanic. The owner Walter does make a list of all the services your car needs but he either doesn't know what he is talking about or he is just trying to get you to do unnecessary services. My car was perfectly healthy and I just wanted him to do a pre purchase inspection. He said my car needed a timing belt at 80,000 and when I told him that the dealer recommends changing it at 120,000 for my car he just made an excuse about how he has to check it and never mentioned anything about that again. Had I not known that he probably would convince me to change the timing belt. He also said that my car needs $3000 engine work because it was leaking coolant. After putting the car on the jack and seeing that there was no coolant leaking he said that it leaks at night, if that was true I would have to either add coolant or the engine would over heat and I don't add coolant and its always full like its supposed to be.  And just to confirm that my car didn't have a coolant leak I took it to a AAA certified mechanic who clearly stated that the engine had no issues or leaks. I am sure if he is doing this with me then he will do it to everyone else who walks into his shop. There are plenty of good mechanics out there so you don't need to come here. I'm sure that everyone who has given him five stars have either fallen for his tricks or they have only had simple services like oil changes from him.</Text>< userid>

Gave me the information and number to a different shop I can go to.who can help me with my problem. I appreciate it and would recommend going here. I know in the future I'll surely  go visit them for my car needs</Review>

<review>Same as most mechanics, they look you over before looking the car over and decide what they can hustle. Went there 2 years ago to get some new plugs put in, when i arrived to pick up the car the owner Walter pulls me over to my car and says "you need new brake pads" and then points at them and says they're worn out bad, but as he is pointing I'm looking directly at the pads and they looked fine, but I tell him its not in my budget and ask how long does he think they will make it, he tells me less than 2 months before they start to cut into the rotor. So when I get home I call my ex to come over and look at how bad they are, my ex laughs and says they look almost new, the guy was just trying to rip you off. That was 2 years ago and I have yet to change pads and ex says theyre still over 75%. So as far as my experience go they tried to scam me and take advantage of me, so I recommend only going to this shop if you know exactly what you need and can commit them to a fixed price otherwise you may be in trouble because you will not be dealing with an honest mechanic like these other reviews would have you believe. Best of Luck if you do.<//review><user_name>Thomas V< /user_name><resp>None<//resp></record>

The best mechanic ever. This is the best place to get your car fixed. And this is the second time that I have been there.  The owner and the personel there,  are very profesional. They make you feel confident. They really take their time to explain what might or is wrong with your car. Furthermore they give you a free estimate.  Si en realidad buscas un mecanico confiable no lo dudes dos veces y visita este lugar.</Text>

I recently moved downtown and needed a mechanic nearby and I came across Right Solution decided to go in to bring my Yaris for a safety check.

The owner and everyone I spoke to in there are very friendly. They spent the time to explain to me that my car needed new brakes and he could do a so so job or a good job that'll last me a couple years. I decided to go ahead with the latter and I'm glad I did, the difference was night and day.

Higly recommend these guys and make sure you park in the enterprise lot!< /review>

<text>I can absolutely recommend Right Solution without reservation.

I just bought a 2011 Saab 9-3 convertible, and wanted to get the oil changed, have it checked out, etc.  I tried Ed Little and Cal, but neither one works on Saabs.  However, Ed Little's recommended Right Solution.  Which is noteworthy in and of itself.

ANYway, I brought it in right when they opened (at 8am on a Wed).  Walter jumped in the car with me, and took it for a test drive.  Really appreciate that he did that.  So we got back, and he had his guys go over the car for an hour with a proverbial fine tooth comb.  When they were done, they brought me into the garage and gave me a bit of a technical tour of the car, which was great!  Then Walter told me it was perfect...not a single thing wrong.  Asked me to bring it back in 5k miles for an oil change and in 6k to have the break pads checked.  I totally expected to have the oil changed because the selling dealer said it might need it.

When I asked Walter what I owed him for the time, he said 'nothing.'   As in nada.  Zip.  Zero.  Zilch.  I even insisted on paying for the hour of his tech's time.  He was adamant that I pay nothing.  Said that the check up was free.  He just asked me to tell my friends about his shop.  Which I will!

He could have changed my oil, replaced the break pads, and charged me $100 for the hour of time.  I would have paid $400 without even thinking about it.  Instead, Walter took the high road.  I'm beyond impressed.

You know what else I noticed?  He really respects his technicians.  Treats them like friends.  Maybe that seems random and irrelevant, but I think it speaks to his integrity.

I actually found an honest mechanic.  So, so relieved.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< time>

<time>1360631827958<//time><Rating>3</Rating><Text>Don't let them near your RV.

Sorry I called them.  I scheduled to leave on a dry camping trip and I wasn't sure about my house batteries so I searched the Web for batteries.  I found Right Solutions Inc. who was more than willing to come to my home and install 4 new batteries.  The first mistake I made other than using their services, was assuming the installer new what he was doing and could connect everything the way it was.  When he finished I checked the charge on my monitor and found that the batteries weren't fully charged.  I was informed that these were new batteries and just needed to charge overnight, so I connected my battery charger and charged the batteries over night.  They were charged the next morning and as I left for my vacation I was confident that I wouldn't have a battery problem but I was wrong.  The next morning my batteries were completely dead and I had to use my generator which should have recharged my batteries through the inverter, but they didn't charge.  I called the warranty number on the battries and they sent me to the nearest dealer who checked the batteries and said they were good but could have been installed wrong. This was out of their expertise.  To make a long story short, since I left my battery charger at home I ended up purchacing a new on at WalMart in Arizona to charge my batteries. I finnaly had a mechanic look at my batteries and it was determined that the insaller connected a wire from the inverter to the negative side instead of the positive.  He corrected it and the system started charging. When I returned home I contacted Right Solutions requesting some type of compensation for the money I spent and was told that their installer experienced and would not have done anything wrong however, we all make mistakes.  They refused to compensate me for the extra money I spent instead they want to have their electrician look at my RV and see if there is a problem.  Of course there's no problem now I paid to have it fixed.  I will continue to try to resolve this issue but it doesn't look hopeful.  I thought I was saving money but it ended up costing me more.  Next time I will buy from Interstate.

I received a call from Rudy the owner of Right Solutions who informed me that he didn't know about the problem I had with the batter installation. It seems that the supervisor talked to me. Anyway the problem has been resolved and I was compensated for the money I spent while in Arizona.  It seems that Right Solutions is interested in providing good customer service by standing behind their work.  That's all I wanted.</Text>< pics>

What started as a good storage experience(central location, fair rental rate and convenient access hours) became a nightmare.  I have never felt more disrespected as a customer ever. Renter beware...I rented the storage unit less than a month ago. I was targeted by the "management team", repeatedly harassed and threatened. This continued even after I asked them to leave me alone. I mind my business and do not participate in any illegal activities. I was accused of "hanging out" as I was loading and unloading things in and out of the storage unit. These "managers" attempted to impose time limits on my visits to the facility(each time I came there was within the gate access hours). They accused me of causing "problems" and "trouble" when I did nothing to anyone there. Without notification, my gate access code was disabled. These people physically denied me entry to the facility by blocking the gate with their vehicle. They placed a 2nd lock on my storage unit blocking my access to my belongings. I contacted law enforcement and the corporate contact for SecureCare Self Storage. Thankfully, I have moved my things from this facility. I will not patronize this company in the future. This "management team" needs retraining in customer service and legal protocol before something worse happens at this location.<//Text>

Mr. Herman

Just wanted to let you know that Mr. Herman was very welcoming, warm, helpful and very pleasant in providing me serve. He should be recognized in him daily meetings as you allow others to know that he's a great asset to the company. In times as these we all need to be acknowledged and this kind of service deserves a raised. Much needed during
This COVID-19...

< Review>
By far the best storage place in Bakersfield. I got a second unit recently and screwed up the lock situation and forgot to lock it. The gentleman, I didn’t catch his name, called me multiple times even though I was out of town and put a lock on the unit to rectify the situation. You can get in until 10 o’clock at night and that’s what I really enjoy. But more than that, The people who work there are very professional and courteous and attentive. I can’t say enough about them.<//Review>

<review>This was literally the best experience I've ever had anywhere, a storage place or otherwise. Tara and Dillon were pleasant and entertaining and incredibly helpful and thorough. I even left with a bigger storage unit than I was planning on getting for less than I was anticipating spending. I had previously gone to another ExtraSpace in town and had a less than pleasant experience so I went here instead and was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great service at a great price.< /review>< pics>

<text>Cheap storage equals bad storage. My unit was broken into within the first month of the lease. I was told I was simply SOL because they're camera footage caught zero footage even though the lock was cut open. The switch over to Secure Storage has been even worse. Rates went up and the customer service went down. I am shared on the lease and simply need the new gate access to drop off things to be stored. Without the primary here I am not allowed access. Spend the extra $10-20 and go to Derrels Mini Storage. There you will have top security with excellent service, speaking from prior experience.< /text><time>1480191348361<//time>< pictures>

SecurCare Self Storage is hard to access.  They have been hard to talk to and in our case only want to change late fees and talk to customers disrespectfully. They have put us on collections for being late days. They had construction in their 1 space parking lot and still told me that I should have no issues getting to the lot to pay on time.  I would have ro park in front of the access gate worry about getting hit.</Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>After changing to SecurCare Self Storage from ExtraSpace, they've reduced hours and are no longer open on Sundays. This comes after rates jumped another $10+ monthly earlier this summer.
The location is absolutely terrible to get in and out of.
If I weren't forced to go to a unit there(I didn't lease it), I would never use this location.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Careful when renting from this place if your late with a payment ( anything passed due date ) bullshit late payment and processing fee start, no courtesy call nothing they just wait till it piles up on top of that rent go's up 10-15 dollar's every six month's or so, funny thing  is that most of these 4 - 5 star review are asked by the person behind the desk to rate them as a 4 - 5 and get 5 dollars off first month rent.<//Review>

Seriously Great place to play rpg BOARDGAMES, D&D and Card games like Magic!  Did I mention Tournaments?  Yeah, there is tournaments, often with prizes!  Great selection of current and past issue COMIC BOOKS.  If you can't find it, they will hunt it down and order it!  They carry a good amount of POP VINYL figures and some others as well.  Also a great rescource for paint and supplies for those who paint their own miniatures for rpg games and models. OH! they sell METROPOLIS, ART MONSTER and DARK KNIGHT COFFEE by the pound, wholebean and ground. Place is awesome! One building west of Taco Bell on Lodi Ave.< /Text>

Haven't stopped by in a while, but the Launchpad is as good as ever! Love the wide range of manga they carry now, many volumes they carried were ones that are extremely hard to find (I.e. Junji Ito's "Tomie". There really is something for everyone here.<//Review>

< review>
I love this store. I go there for Magic the Gathering products. Mike always has a good selection of accessories for tcg's. And while I don't play table top games, it seems like he's got a good selection of things like miniatures, paints and accessories for table top gaming as well..

What impresses me most is that the prices of his sealed Magic products are so competitive. You can get a booster box, packs and other sealed products for pretty cheap.

The only downside I would say is Mike doesn't deal in singles. If you are looking to buy single MTG, YGO, or Pokémon cards you'll have to go somewhere else. As for everything else, Mike either has it, or he can get it.

When we can get back to playing in stores. His store is fun to play at as well; great crowd, clean bathroom, the new store arrangement is excellent to. If you are into physical gaming like trading cards, table top or board games, Launchpad is a great place to shop at!</review>

Service is always friendly and helpful. Prices are great, typically close to what you'll find online or cheaper.

They carry a lot of various items such as board games, card games, comics, tabletop miniatures, paints, etc.

Events hosted such as MTG nights or Board Game Day.</text>

Love this place, owner is very helpful and nice. This is where I get all my pokemon booster boxes or packs. Has a fair share of items for the tcg player. Can also help you by ordering something you like from their distributors. I would definitely recommend you check this place out!</Text>

I grew up around Comic Grapevine for a bit and heard this place opened up a block or so away, at the time it was small in terms of selection and I don’t believe it even had TCG at the time.
I then stopped playing for about 10 years and I did hear this place open up next to Taco Bell, they have a great location by the way. And well I went in their last month and they had a good selection. With a variety of things. The owner which I’m assuming is the gentleman in the front was nice. (He could be a murderer, but I wouldn’t know because of how nice he is). Anyways I get my Pokémon cards there, and I plan to do it here because he can order when needed. 5/5 for sure.<//review>

Good selection of graphic novels,  tabletop games, Miniatures, and RPG's. Tables to game on. A clean restroom,  very important for an all day stay. It has a fast food place close by for meals. So definitely worth visit.< /text>

<Time>1521219287897</Time><review>The dude who runs the place pretty much knows about everything he sells, which is particularly useful when looking for new boardgames. The establishment hosts several games if you like social gaming or just need a spot cuz your friends are lame and always doing things like work and school, but I digress. If you like comics, board games, card games, and tabletop  RPGs, then this should be one of you're regular stops.<//review></record>

The gentlemen I met up front was a pretty nice guy as far as my visit went, sadly a small variety of card games, which is why I traveled out that day, however it had the staple magic the gathering,yugioh, and some vanguard, dragonball tcg, nice to see weiss schwartz there to, it actually made my week.  comics were a major portion of the shop and hidden away was table space to use, honestly a small amount but the building is relatively small so I feel he did good with that. If you wanna give it a shot and look I'd say go for it, you never know what you might find.</Text>

When they first moved to Lodi after they flopped in Stockton they rented the location of the former adult video store as their new store.

Why? Because it was right next to Lodi Grapevine. They needed to steal customers. They tried the same thing with Al's comics in Stockton but failed.

Their Lodi location is small and cramped. Somewhat decent selection of comics but limited gaming supplies. Staff is polite enough until you ask them about other shops in the area (Stockton, Manteca, and even Sacramento).

That's when they go into their sales pitch about how they're the best and the other shops are run by "retards".<//review>

Wow. Just wow. This place is heaven incarnate. The Angels who tend this store will do literally anything you ask them to within the boundaries of the law. Feel free to test that claim. Dare I say they have the best customer service and board game selection this side of the Mississippi— nay, the Milky Way? I do indeed dare. Get yourself to the Launchpad and launch your butt into a never-ending spiral of addiction to board games, card games, comics, and everything geekalicious. Also clean bathroom.</text>

<text>The food was Yummy so I would wait in line if I didn't have anything better to do! The service was average, the food was reasonably priced, and the items on the menu were not your ordinary pick of the mill so go try it if you don't mind waiting in line.</text><user>106037847330318184453< /user><gmap_id>0x80e90ed5aef0cc3b:0xd3e95752d74d5e4e<//gmap_id>< Response>

<Text>The carnita torta was absolutely delicious. The carnitas were made well and not dry like some carnitas I have tasted. It was very well worth the 8.50. Very nice place and the workers are very polite.

<text>They had exactly what I was looking for. Fresh fish tacos, not breaded but actual chunks of fish, layered a top soft corn tortillas with cabbage slaw and avocado cream, served with fresh and delicious rice and black beans. The salsa bar had a cool variety of options from mild to super spicy. The perfect compliment to my perfect fish tacos. Ambiance is super casual. Staff was very kind and friendly. We'll definitely come back again to try something else on the menu.</text><user>117783781770469583965< /user>< pictures>

Decent food at a decent price with barely OK service. The salsa bar is what keeps me coming back. If you speak fluent Spanish you're golden. Also, don't try to call on Tuesdays, they're just so busy they don't answer.<//Review>

Excellent selection and great service at an affordable price. This Rudy's location is not a big Restaurant like some others, just a small cafe style place with some seating outside. They had a molé special on when we went there and the sauce was delicious with the chicken enchiladas. Their guacamole is fresh and excellent.<//text>

<Review>Props to the staff who handled a suddenly slammed night (grapevine was closed...the whole I-5 crowd was crawling along the 101 and stopping converging on any and all restaurants).  Food was solid, though for the price I expected more than "solid."< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I'm surprised at the good reviews here...I'm not one to leave a review, but our experience here was so bad I feel like I HAD to....We went here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch..I ordered the fish tacos, my husband had beef tacos... Neither one of us could eat our meals...the fish was mushy and sitting on what looked like old guacamole (greenish brown and MUSH).. I had one bite, and had to FORCE myself to swallow it...my husband's tacos were the same...he couldn't eat them either- and he's NEVER turned down a taco!! His FAVE!   we also ordered chips and guacamole... the guacamole came in a plastic container with a lid as opposed to a bowl (??) and had NO flavor...it's like they just mashed some avocados and called it 'guacamole'... the chips were obviously store bought and heated up in a microwave and then served scattered on a paper plate (???)...seemed VERY odd for a Mexican restaurant to sever something VERY commonly ordered this way..CHEAP!!...then I went to use the restroom before we left.... apparently you have to ask for a key and when I did they couldn't find it.... ???!! .. and worse, they just scattered some trash around a little box under the register where the key is kept for about 1.5 seconds, said "we lost the key" and that was it-- they didn't even keep looking!! Just said "oh, we can't find it" and that was it!!  What about the next customer who requests it??  How do you NOT have a restroom available to customers??!!  I would have to say this was the worst dining experience I have ever had...My husband and I were SO angry that we spent $40 on an inedible meal...we should have complained,  but we just wanted to get OUT of there...</Review>< Pictures>

Overall great Mexican food in Carpinteria, my favorite is the Enchiladas Verde, also Taco Tuesdays are a locals favorite with lines frequently out the door. Try the shredding chicken deep fried taco, they pack an amazing amount of cheese into a tasty taco that's all I can say. Great salsa bar and service.</review>

Excellent salsa bar. If you eat food for the sauces, like I do, this is the Mexican food place for you. I almost always get chicken taquitos. They are served with lettuce and a generous portion of guacamole. Then I smother everything with a couple of different salsas. It's a meal!< /Review>

Rudys has always been good but our last visit we ordered a chicken enchilada but it was served sans chicken.  The workers refused to correct their error.
Very strange. I've been meaning to call the owner.</Review>

OK for a quick bite if you are in the mood for Mexican food.  The wait was a little longer than expected and because I went on Taco Tuesday they had run out of certain items.  The salsa bar wasn't very clean and therefore didn't look all that appetizing.  Friendly staff!</Text>

Their selection of burritos and tacos are quite good. They have a taco Tuesday which is the best time to get the best deals but they do sell  out so it's best to get there earily. Also the staff is nice enough and overall I'm pleased.<//Text>

One of the better Mexican restaurants in Carpinteria. The place is clean and orderly, staff is polite and friendly. I ordered the special nachos and a taco and they were both okay. My biggest complaint is that the cheese on my nachos wasn't melted and the meat on them wasn't even warm. The prices are on the higher side for Mexican food and I'd only come back if I was stuck in Carpinteria and wanted Mexican food</review>

<Text>Went there for their famous breakfast burrito and was told they were "out"? What does that mean?
No menus posted anywhere excepted stacked on counter - looks like a temporary beanery.
I will NOT be back.< /Text>< rating>

Out-of-the-way Spot, close to camping grounds, ample seating, large portions, reasonable prices, free refills on soda pop. There is also sufficient parking for your truck and trailer.< /Text>

I ordered the kids burrito because the regular size is way to big and they just recently told me I can't order it any more because I am not a kid. I was a regular too and now I haven't been back for months. It wasn't the best burrito but some of the food is really good. It is a bit pricey as well.<//text>

I did not like the food of this place, even though I like mexican food (I leved in Mexico for a while). I had a Flauta, and I did not finish it, it was to juicy and the chiken meat was not good. Taco grande restaurant nearby is 10 times better for the same budget</Text>

If you like huge plates of mediocre seafood (at best) this is the place for you. Our server was very competent but I only go because my elderly sister likes the huge plates of stuff. Certainly not for the food. The pasta was overcooked. The two types of lobster were overcooked. The shrimp were tasteless. The biscuits could have used a few extra minutes in the oven but the flavor was what I expected. The mashed potatoes had been around a while. The hostess was chatting away with some other workers and couldn't have missed me waiting at her stand for a long awaited table. Spend your hard-earned somewhere else if you want seafood. There are so many better places.</review>

That ruined the rest of our night.  The food was great, but we were gonna, stay and have  some cocktails. I went to the bathroom and my check was already waiting for me.  No I guess I didn't want another drink. But, overall the waitress was nice, and attentive.  That's why it was 3 stars and not one.  Management should be paying attention to the poor service. Usually,  we have someone from management checking on us. That didn't happen either.< /review>< pics>

I like that location they're always nice and the one time I had a problem with my order they fixed it food is really good the chicken Cajun Alfredo is really good my kids favorite, the coconut shrimp with the pineapple dip is amazing and the chocolate cake with ice cream is the way to close out the meal ... we share one it's has alot of chocolate for one person but the ice cream balances it out</Review>

We went in for my wife's birthday dinner. 6 of us ordered aer food . When the food got there all the food was cold the plate's were hot to touch she warned us about the plates . All the food on those plates was cold.  Hot plate's doesn't warm cold food !!!! For a  $167.00 rounded off was a great disappointment for being my wife's favorite place even she says we will never go back there ever. We are spreading the word also!!!!!!</Text>

<Review>Fake meat 🤷🏻‍♀️ not happy with my curbside order . I ordered medium well and this looked medium rare..nor did it have the texture of steak.. it seemed processed idk but it was gross . And this just wasn't worth the price I paid, my biscuits were smashed a kinda mushy. Only reason they got 2 stars was for the cajun chicken alfredo that my kids enjoyed , I will not be eating here any more<//Review>< time>

I went to Red lobster today to take my mother for her birthday it was about 3:00 and they told us anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour away my mother has an oxygen tank that she cares with her portable has cost her health issues and she cod and she's 77 years old and they couldn't even accommodate her seat to sit down you know what I mean you got to look out for the senior citizens and I'm that guy that look out for my mother I don't think I never come to Red lobster again I got better service when I went over to Lucille's over in Rialto that's why I left this star poor service and I don't think I never come back again</Text>

<Review>We ordered the create your own trio, with scallops, White fish, and shrimp scampi. The white fish had a lot of dark and was fishy tasting and two pieces one case was okay the clam chowder was watered down with water and wasn't good tasting at all, the scallops were the size of a nickel, not a very good bargain to only get four pieces plus an upcharge of $2.99 on the meal for them, the shrimp scampi was good. The Caesar salad didn't taste right on the dressing, and I only found one piece of cheese in mine, but my daughter found several in hers. I won't be wasting my money on that meal again.<//Review>< Pictures>

We wait one hour for our table and finnally we were seated and then we wait for almost half and hour and nobody came to take our order not even our drinks. They serve other people that came way later that us So we decide to get up and leave what a horrible service. Thank you Red Lobster for ruined our Friday night with my wife.< /review>

Our waiter Jonathan was amazing he had such amazing customer service!! All the food was amazing (except the steak was very bloody when I ordered it medium well ) But it's a seafood restaurant not a steak house! I went for a celebration and had a good time!! Jonathan and Susanna made lasting impressions!< /text>

I had a terrible experience at TGI Fridays last week. Honestly their chefs and waiters and hostesses need to be trained by the Red Lobster staff.<//Review>< response>

Take out quality is mid tier and extremely expensive for small portions. Would avoid completely unless you very specifically want this food and dont care how much you pay for it. Even the biscuits arent as good as when they're served fresh in the restaurant.<//text>

The wait time was a nightmare but it understandable given that it was Saturday night.
My date and I sat at a window booth and we had a very nice waitress. She was bubbly and sweet with great knowledge of the menu.
Food was excellent! Rich, creamy and delicious. The manager was hovering around a lot - I didn't particularly like that but I'm sure it's so people know they can easily access him with their concerns.
Overall it was a great experience, I highly recommend this place (but bring deep pockets).<//review>

<name>Sean Shih<//name>< Review>
UPDATE: 4-05-2021
Food: 1 star
Service: 5 Star

Thought I'd go for my belated birthday feast, unfortunately, it was a major disappointment.

I ordered the Lobster Lover's Dream, the Lobster in the linguini smells very fishy, I had to order a replacement, but the taste of the new plate is off, I picked off the shrimp and left most of the pasta. Then, the Maine Lobster was way over baked, as shown in the picture, it was hard and chewy.  I left half of the lobster on the plate.

Yes, a major disappointment. Half way home, it downed on me that I should have ask for a discount instead paying for the full price.

ORIGINAL POST:
Always delivers good tasty food. And great service.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>We had excellent service at Red Lobster. We went in for Endless Shrimp (a once-a-year tradition), and were impressed with the quality of the food. The shrimp selections were good, the sides were well prepared, and the presentation was fine. But the service was excellent. Red Lobster is not for everyone, but we had a very positive experience on our visit.< /Review>< Pictures>

You would think with such low volume they would be "On it".  Not the case, for got my drink and made ordering over complicated. And WHY would you serve a Maine Lobster tail witha rocklobster tail. Way to shame the rock Lobster... they don't even compare in this galaxy!!!
Shape up or I'll start driving to HB!!!<//Review>

I was told that my order should've been out at 6:15pm. I waited well over a hour for my order, and the greeter couldn't even tell me the status of my order. Absurd.<//Review>

<Text>I placed an online order at 3:20 pm for a 7:00 pm curbside pickup. When our driver arrived at the restaurant he was informed that orders were running two hours late. I called and selected the option to speak with the manager. After twenty minutes on hold, the system told me I’d been on hold too long and hung up. Our driver waited there until 8:30 and was told the restaurant was now closed, without completing our order. We are in total shock about how poorly customers are treated. We are doing our best to support local businesses right now, but apparently Red Lobster doesn’t care. If you have more business than you can handle, why take orders and close before completing them???<//Text>< Pictures>

Did not like the extra slow service. Seems as if they were not prepared to conduct business.
Waited for my food order for nearly an hour while I saw many people being served that arrived some time after I had.</text>

I like red lobster but you have to understand why your coming here. All the food we have had here is cooked very well.  Service can be hit or miss. Our challenge has always been around crab legs.

My wife loves crab legs. They are cooked well and taste good but one thing or another always happens. We either don't get the right tools to crack them open, they forget to cut them for easier access to the meat, or they are cold.

I have always gotten, lobster in some form or another had it has been great. Fish is cooked well and taste great.

Their biscuits always has to much salt. Some people like it, we don't.

You pay less at red lobster but you need to order to their strong suits and keep expectations in check.

They are in a different class than Kings Fish, and Taps is in an even different class. I know your spending $35 for a meal, but at taps that meal would be $70 and up, but it would be worth every bit it.

If I just want some lobster, then I go to Red Lobster.  If I want a someone to cater to my every need, be in a much more formal setting, top of the line quality, then I got to Taps, but I also pay for it.

My wife will now knows not to order crab legs.

We will be back.</Review>

I forgot to take pictures of my food I was so hungry! I only yook in pics of the amazing biscuits. I forgot what the name of the Combo is but it was bacon potato soup! Soooo good! Then as caesar salad, very fresh, shrimp kebabs grilled in garlic sauce, a baked potato loaded with stuff and wild rice and then an amazing brownie dessert!!! So much food for 17.99!! Everything tasted freshly made. I originally wanted lobster but it was just too much food. The service was impecable  and the staff were proffessional and helpful. Will be visiting again very soon!< /review>

No one showed up for another 30 minutes. Don’t come here on a Sunday night around 7:30 you’ll get treated like trash.

Ordered today on mother's day. $130 in food and a confirmation email later I was sent to wait for my until 6 pm. 6 pm rolled around and no food. I try to call and I'm met with a person saying "no more orders" then promptly hangs up on me. Awesome! I had to find another thing to eat for my mom on mother's day come 8:00 pm. I was told my delivery was on its way at 6 pm...< /text>

<review>Crowded on Friday night, That's Not Unusual. Waited 25 minutes for a table and about 10 minutes for a server to come by. Not a problem that can be expected on a Friday night. Food was plentiful and tasty the only problem I encountered was my raspberry iced tea lacking very much raspberry or ice. Overall pleasant evening and I went home feeling full like I should take a nap.</review>< gmapID>

Service was ok. Food was awful! Snow crab was dehydrated like beef jerky. A very nice fresh replacement was brought to our table. Not once did the manager stop by to check on us. Even after sending food back.
Over all experience was well below expectations. Red Lobster should be an amazing experience. Not just a rushed meal. Very sad. I love red lobster.</review>

I can probably say everyone's United on the cheese bread vote of delicious food cheers my moms choice of food pre surgery,  I would definitely love to see this establishment add a little spice ,Eric's chili oil would have been perfect on that pasta

I decided to try red lobster for the first time and order there filet mignon and it had so much flavor but tasted so simple. It was amazing!!! I definitely would recommend going to red lobster it has everything for everyone, even if you don't like sea food. Such a family friendly place with amazing waiters that are on top of everything. I will admit that some of the portions are small but are still fair but most of the sea food there comes in massive proportions and really doesn't take long.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9XAkpSygzijNcuLARIyNdBwMHUYiIPZalxGzH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVNVU4W2tSAW4AhoLmA-cE9hLNuYqA1BQxyBFo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Took my wife there for mother's day I had made reservations two days prior. The bar was awesome for happy hour great choices for drinks and apps. We have a three course meal for dinner in a nice private booth, clean and respectable employees the food was delicious and our evening was perfect.<//review>

<Review>I would've given it five stars, if our food had been hot. It was still delicious. We had lobster, steak and crab legs. We couldn't finish it all. Our waitress, Vivian, took very good care of us, even though the restaurant was packed. One of our FAVORITE places to go, though a little pricey.< /Review><Date>1549926207168</Date>< Gmap_id>

The food was great but this restaurant needs some better management.  Running a national ad promotion which always brings more people and they obviously didn't plan for it.   We were told a 15 minute wait - it was 40 minutes.  People coming in after us were told 45 minutes,  55 minutes,  at least an hour. When we were taken to our table found they were only utilizing about half the tables in the restaurant and it remained that way during the entire hour we were enjoying our dinner.  When we left there were at least 15-20 groups still waiting to be seated and there were at least that many clean,  empty tables in the dining room.</text>

<review>Endless shrimp is back at Red Lobster for just $15.99! Lmfaooooo BUT ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME. Anyways...great food. Great service. Unfortunately, you have to wear pants in this establishment, so I recommend perhaps leggings.  Just wear anything that will conform to your ever changing pregnancy body, as you go from "not pregnant" to 9 months within the hour. Doors are accommodating as you roll yourself out the door.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>I visited the Riverside Red Lobster after my Kaiser appt.  I ordered takeout at the bar and bartender was very sweet.  I ordered the new bowl, one Dragon one seasonal, both with salmon.  Unfortunately they didn’t have salmon and were kind enough to substitute white fish instead.  Not sure what type, but it was absolutely delicious! I will definitely return to this Red Lobster!  It had great energy and the staff was super friendly!<//text><user_name>Sandra Carranza< /user_name><Date>1573770347235<//Date><rating>5</rating>< pics>

Chedder Bay Biscuits for the win!!!! Amazing food. My big concern is the amount of time it takes to get the food. The smaller concern is the large portion of time the servers wait between checking on me. I finished my drink Debbie and I require a refill 5 minutes ago!< /Review>

<Text>I like Red Lobster for its reasonably priced seafood. We decided to go out on a Thursday night, so we wouldn't have to deal with the crowds. Although I had placed us on the "Wait List", there was no wait on our arrival. We were seated quickly and our waitress was there in minutes. All good. Food and drinks were provided in a timely manner. Also good. Our problem was in receiving seconds on the Endless Shrimp. We waited 20 minutes for each new serving. That's a long time to wait between servings. Upon complaint, we were told they were short on cooks. Hmmmm... that shouldn't be our problem, but if this had been mentioned first, then we could have ordered seconds accordingly. All-in-all, I think it will be awhile before we return.< /Text><name>Tammy Casado< /name><rating>3</rating>< Time>

Well, I have had better....first the sitting looked like we were sat in the Black section...just odd how this one section was filled with People of color. Food well sent my steak back...ordered it medium rare. Cook must have forgotten..and cooked it to medium well. Lobster was dry...but only mentioned the Steak meal was already done at that point. Just it a great experience thought Red Lobster would be better.....not even a good try...Wow!</text>

<Review>First order of biscuits was great. Second batch was underdone. Service was poor. Our server rarely checked on us. 3 of the 4 of us were about done with our food (talking 20+ minutes) before we saw her again to point out that one of us was still waiting on food (the lobster & shrimp mini roll). Food & drinks were decent, but not enough to make up for the dining experience.< /Review>< Pics>

No one to greet us at the door, waited for about 3 to 4 minutes before anybody showed up... I asked the lady if they do anything for a birthday and they said yes... she passed us to another man and told him about the birthday and he took all the place  settings and put us in our seats but evidently he forgot to tell the waitress about the birthday.... it was not very crowded at all when we got into the place but the waitress took forever to get to us.... everything seemed to go pretty well except slow service... when all was said and done and she finally brought the check after waiting for a while, I said isn't the birthday boy going to get his treat and she said, oh, I did not know about a birthday... it had taken so long that we finally just said we'll take the birthday treat home... things like this is what causes us to not want to leave generous tips... It should always be about the fabulous & efficient service for each & every customer... we liked all the food... Please continue to work on training your people with greater customer service...

<Review>I became paranoid after using the toilet.  The restroom was dirty and to add injury to insult the hand soap was watered down.  It makes you wonder what's going on in the kitchen!<//Review></record>

A favorite location for tasty seafood. I was super full. There was fast and courteous service. Prices were good for how much you get. Atmosphere and food reminds me of Virginia Beach.</Review>

The food is outstanding, the service is outstanding, pricing is excellent and the place is clean and doesn't smell of dead fish. They are consistent with the quality of their products and always tastes good.  The server was very knowledgeable of the menu and from time of order to food on the table was an acceptable amount of time. The server was also attentive and kept our glass's filled with fresh tea and plenty of ice. The over all experience was A+ and I would recommend this Red Lobster to all who ask.< /Review>

<Text>First order of biscuits was great. Second batch was underdone. Service was poor. Our server rarely checked on us. 3 of the 4 of us were about done with our food (talking 20+ minutes) before we saw her again to point out that one of us was still waiting on food (the lobster & shrimp mini roll). Food & drinks were decent, but not enough to make up for the dining experience.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>Well, I have had better....first the sitting looked like we were sat in the Black section...just odd how this one section was filled with People of color. Food well sent my steak back...ordered it medium rare. Cook must have forgotten..and cooked it to medium well. Lobster was dry...but only mentioned the Steak meal was already done at that point. Just it a great experience thought Red Lobster would be better.....not even a good try...Wow!</Review><Rating>2</Rating>< Time>

Service was superb, thank you Izzy for the great service. I had the lobster fest, surf and turf. I was expecting the small lobster tail and got the little split one. I went with the medium sized steak. It was cooked perfectly, I just didn't enjoy that cut of meat.  Loved the new green beans and mushrooms. The sample item was terrible, the lobster roll. I would remove that all together. Everything was cooked to perfection and I look forward to the next special occasion. Thank you!<//Text>

<text>Took my wife here for our anniversary. The staff was very nice. The menu has a ton of things to select from. It can be semi expensive but it's definitely worth the price. I had the coconut shrimp and it was phenomenal. My wife had some shrimp pasta dish and one of their special mix drinks. She loved them both. The drink was just the right mix between sweet and strong. I would definitely recommend this place</text>< Pics>

The service was slow and the waitress didn't get our orders right. When I was told what side dishes were offered and after I made my choice then I was told that what I ordered would be a few dollars more. We all ordered cups of soup and got bowls at a higher price and most of the food was cold when it arrived at the table. Not only that but we were seated literally right next to the bathroom door. I know I could have asked for another table but after waiting for 25 minutes who knows how long that would take. I might give the place  another try in the future but I'll have to really think about it.<//Review>

Just OK food and ambience. I forgot how run of the mill food Red Lobster services. I ordered Lobster, Shrimp and Blackened Salmon and the Salmon was barely OK. Above our table there was a light that keep going dim to bright slowly. When I brought it to the attention of the manager, he told yup I know we are waiting for the new light to come in. I had dinner on Thursday at 5:30pm with lots of empty booths, but they sat us at a booth with a broken light. That tells you how well the restaurant is managed and their customer service training. Go to Market Broiler and get a better meal and service for similar money and superior  ambience.<//Text>

Food was good. My salmon portion was small for a dinner portion. The sides were also good and the service was great. Yes, the service was definitely above average. We went on a weeknight and the place was empty. Would definitely come back.< /Review>

We went to Red Lobster 0523 -  3700 Park Sierra Riverside, Ca 92505-3062 Yesterday Saturday 03-02-2019 Table 5 Heaven I 19:32:08 - typically we don't like to complain but the service was horrible - first of all when we were seated at the table it took 30 minutes to get a drink - they totally forgot to supply us with crab crackers and bibs for the order of Crab Legs - they were obviously way too busy to give any good service or pay attention to your customers - Food is always good just got shoddy service - had to take the crab legs home as we did not have the utensils to eat them and they got cold anyways. unfortunately we had to tip based on the service on a scale of 1 to 5 this Red Lobster gets a 2 was gonna give you a 1 but you get a two in the past you might have gotten a 5 but not this time just thought that the Public should know or be aware. Thank You and Make it a Great Day.<//review>

The food was not great. The clam chowder was gritty. Two in our party got the endless shrimp. There were 6 choices of shrimp. The breaded shrimp was cold and flavorless. The pasta was also cold. The best thing about the pasta was the little shrimp. The best breaded shrimp was the Nashville hot, which had a good kick to it. My husband's fish was flavorless as well.

I gave 3 stars because the service was great. Our waiter, Tim, was phenomenal. He saved the dining experience for us.</Text>

Love it, but the prices need to adjust downward; or have an additional menu that is slightly less experience. I realize the quality of the food, but the economy says for us to bring in more long term customers, we need to introduce a menu more people can afford.< /Text>

Food was cold. I ask for salt pepper butter. 5 minutes went by and I had to ask the waitress again for it. By then I had already eaten my unsalted food. I won't go back there again.< /Review>

< Review>
The establishment is cozy and welcoming. The staff I interact with always seem to be in high spirits. The alcohol menu is well stocked, and the meals are always changing and you have options. My experience has always been the food tasting super high in sodium, no matter what I get. The biscuits tend to feel heat lamped or lukewarm at best. Not my ideal seafood joint, but a good place to bring a smaller family for cost.</Review>

Their food is less than what's on their pictures. Rice has no seasoning. Mashed potatoes was a tablespoon size. They have done better in the pass.</Review>

<Review>Start off by saying I've been to other red Lobsters before. I went to one in Boise and it was great in every aspect. However not so with this location. We arrived at the place which enters into a bar, which was empty and they tried to seat us there. We declined and ask to be seated in the dining room. Which had only two other tables occupied. The waitress was cordial but not real friendly. I said I left my glasses in the car but could read most of the menu but not the special and asked if she could tell me about it. She declined. Ok, not a good start but everyone has bad days. So the food...we had the special feast... Well started off with a soup. Lobster bisque which is extra. What are the smallest portions of soup I've ever seen anywhere, anywhere.. then had the Caesar salad. What was smallish and kind of dry but had sliced parmesan.  Then had the shrimp Alfredo. A small amount of noodles and adequate amount of shrimp. But was flavorless. The very small bay shrimp was watery tasting. Last but least was the desert. So small that we looked at each other and laughed. I do not want you to take my word for it. Go down and give it a try then you can give me thumbs up when you look at this comment again. 😂<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>We visited the Red Lobster across the street from Kaiser on Magnolia. It was our 1st time at this one. We both got the Build your own Ultimate Feast...Dee-lish!! I had scallops, garlic shrimp and shrimp skewers w/rice and broccoli. The shrimp and the lobster tail were large and in charge! And had a Cadillac Frozen Margarita to boot. Big place, very roomy. Staff very pleasant...Will definitely have dinner there again!< /text>< Date>

Arrived for a late lunch/early dinner. We were told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table. There was no one at the bar so we sat there and were able to order anything from the menu. We ordered the all you can eat shrimp. There are several different ways you could have it prepared. I started with the shrimp scampi and the Mediterranean shrimp.  Both were excellent. The service was great.   We will definitely stop here again.</Review>

Yesterday my family and I went to have a Birthday Dinner  the food and service was great, server was very attentive and nice, but at the end I was finishing my drink and I almos swallow a piece of glass I thought it was a piece of ice but it felt weird and hard in my mouth I thank God that I din't swallow it.  I got really scared I felt like my sugar level went down. Told server and server brouth Manager. Didn't felt appreciated after this shocking incident.
Kitchen staff need to be more careful this could of end up worse. I hope I was the only one that when thru this shoking incident last night. :-(< /review>

< Review>
We usually have a pleasant experience, however last night was horrible. The service itself was good and quick, food tasted pretty good. 5 hours after I ate, I woke up to vomiting and diarrhea at the same time! I’ve been in bed since last night, “vomiting” through every hole. I’m 10 weeks pregnant and have to go to the hospital for IV fluids tomorrow morning if I don’t get better. I now have a fever and can’t keep anything down. It’s been this way for 16 hours.
I ordered clam chowder, ceaser salad, soy-ginger salmon with steamed broccoli and a side of lobster mashed potatoes with a peach iced tea. Only 2 things could have been contaminated: the iced tea or lobster mashed potatoes. I only ate a little bit of everything, gave about half to my daughter and husband and they feel fine. The only thing I didn’t share was the iced tea and lobster mashed potatoes. My husband got a stomach ache and a little nausea. I’m thinking that the lobster sauce isn’t ordered as often with mashed potatoes, so it could have been contaminated. (It’s a premium side dish, at extra $4.49 I believe).<//Review>

Visited this establishment for a private intimate dinner with my husband. I informed the waiter that we were celebrating his birthday. So I looked forward to the customary dessert and birthday song after dinner.
We ordered the Seaside trio with a Cesar salad. I noticed that the price has gone up and portion size went down. The food taste well but the salad was lacking sufficient dressing.
Our waitor seemed to be in a hurry and was quite forgetful. To my dismay he tottaly forgot about the fact we were celebrating a birthday. Needless to say no ice cream or song.
He left the bill on the table and disappeared. Now I remember why I had stop coming to this Red Lobster in Lakewood. I much prefer the one in Torrance.< /Review>

<review>My family and I came to this establishment today and the waitress didn't return my husband's bank card to him. So when I call the restaurant to have them look for it I was asked a bunch of questions about what the card looked like and other info about the card, after I provided the information I was put on hold while the girl supposedly went to ask the manager if they could look for the card. 20 minutes later... The girl comes back to the phone to tell me the manager is to busy to look right now and would give me a call later if the card was found. I thought it was weird but I gave her my call back number and ended the call. An hour had passed and still no call so I called the restaurant again. This time I asked if anyone had even started looking for his bank card yet. The girl asked the name on the card again ( it was the same girl I spoke with the first time) I gave her the name and she told me to hold on while she apparently went to check if the card was found. We were already in route to the restaurant to find out in person what was going on so  30 minutes pass and she still hadn't returned to the phone so my husband went inside and they finally decided  to "look" and magically the bank card appeared out of thin air on the completely opposite side of the restaurant near the bathroom. Hmmm. My husband informed them that it was a strange place to find his card seeing as we never went in that section of the restaurant. I seemed like the staff might have tried to pull an inside job on us. We will never done at this particular red lobster because of this. For anyone who plans to go there I suggest you use either a gift card or pay in cash.<//review>< user_id>

<Text>I've loved Red Lobster since I was a child and I've never really had a negative experience. My server was great which was why I gave a 2 however my food was not the best at all my Lobster was not cooked well and the meat wasn't separated from the shell before cooking so my entire lobster was mushed to the shell. My partners was as well. The snow crab was also not fresh. I eat seafood often and the crab had a crumbling texture .

Worst service  ever. The server took too long to take the order then almost knocked down our drinks while setting down the appetizer.  Of course we ordered an entree with soup and he never brought the soups until after the entree. After that we asked for lemons and the server never came back. What the hell happened to this place?  Very disappointed.< /text>

I just recently went back to red lobster after a bad experience a year ago. This time the food was so perfectly prepared. Everything was excellent. Not sure if its new management or the cook but seriously if you havent been in a while or maybe the food seemed sub par. Give them another chance. You wont be disappointed. We ordered the clam chowder, fried fish, ceaser salad and cajun chicken alfredo. Sooo good!<//Text>

<Date>1546707557380<//Date><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>The hubs and I went to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and I think we simply chose the wrong time of day to show up. It was just before 4:30pm, and, at least, five staff members showed up behind us. There was no one out front, so we waited, and waited, as crew member after crew member walked this way and that. One person eventually said someone would be with us, and more time passed. Our waitress was very nice. She seemed quite distracted, however. Our section wasn't very packed, but I suppose it was busy enough. We waited quite some time for our waters, and the biscuits. After taking our order, the food arrived rather quickly. My mashed potatoes were cold. It was odd, because the rest of my food was hot. Perhaps they were placed on the plate first, before the rest of the food was cooked? We needed tartar sauce, ketchup, and cocktail sauce. When it finally arrived, there wasn't enough for each plate. We were asked if we wanted more biscuits. We did, but they never came. Perhaps she didn't here our, "Yes" response? Also, there was an upcharge on one of the drinks, when we specifically asked if there was a deviation from the listed price. The hot food was delicious. The cold mashed potatoes was very disappointing. The lack of attention to the specific requested condiments and additional biscuits, was very disappointing, as well. We did receive a refill on our water, and after specifying again, we received the correct number of condiments and lids for our leftovers. By the time we left, it was busy. Every table in our section was filled, and there was a line out front. I have mixed feelings about this visit, as it seems things got better by the end, when it was actually busy. We've received better service from Denny's, on a Saturday morning, and they stay packed!  Red Lobster earned two stars. I hope they can redeem themselves, IF I ever decide to go back. #disappointed</Review>< Pics>

Sat at the bar and Steve could not handle serving few customers on the bar and serving the few tables outside the bar. Customers waiting to be service and for food  for unacceptable time. Waited 15 minutes for a shrimp pasta this is after eating the salad and soup. Lobster bisque tasted like can soup and salty.</Review>

I grew up on the east coast and developed love of seafood, lobster rolls being my favorite !
Got the lobster roll...SORELY DISAPPOINTED !   $8.00 for a 6"  roll with only cubed pieces of lobster laying in the roll. Not the kind of lobster roll I grew up on.  East coast rolls are over filled with a LOBSTER SALAD !
Won't return. Make a REAL lobster roll and I might !

Good day, CJ</text>

I took the whole family there and they brought everyone's dish but mine, after 20 minutes they asked how everything was and I asked "Where's mine?" They took my order a second time and I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my entree. You would think for the expensive prices one would get good service but nope. Not worth the inflated prices. The only good thing are the biscuits. Those kept me from going hungry.<//Text>

<text>Very good food today.  The server we had was on top of her game.  Great service.  Only complaint is employees getting dropped off for work blocking parking even though they saw us waiting.  Customer service begins before entering the building.< /text>< user_id>

The food was good, however the garlic shrimp was slightly salty. We (w/family)were seated next to the emergency exit door which was not a good table. We received salads without utensils, coffee without enough sugar packets. Our biscuits took long to get to our table and to ask for anything else we had to either track our waitress or ask another staff member( whom did not listen or cared to please us). We were  also over charged and to top it off double charged because of the first bill discrepancy ( $ will take a couple days to go back to my acc).  Just awful! I would recommend a different location.</review><Resp>{'time': 1538593339628, 'text': 'Hi Sonia Villa, we’re sorry to learn about your disappointing experience at our Riverside restaurant and we’d like to know more.

Tried take out, was a horrible experience. Took over twice as long as they told me, talked to other waiting for pick-up that had been waiting for 45 min. For soup and salad. Charged extra for biscuits that would be free if I ate there and nobody there cared at all including the manager.<//Text>

The food was tasteless. Way over priced. If I didnt have a $50.00 gift card it would have been $70.00 for lunch. I dont plan on going back. How can you mess up a lobster roll and give less than a cup of fries? Experience was horrible.<//review>

Went to the Red Lobster and it wasn't so good. The service though, was excellent and our waiters were there for everything that we needed.  I think that the shellfish are not so fresh and that is why it was great.  I can tell at least that when I'm eating seafood that has been previously frozen and this was.</Text>

< review>
This Red Lobster is across from Kaiser in Riverside. I am not too keen on the service. The lunch/dinner salad was not crisp and fresh and had just a few pieces of vegetables. That was the first time I had that experience at Red Lobster. I could not catch anyones eye to refill my cola. The waitress seemed to have too many customers to give excellent service however she was pleasant as she raced by and brought the food or gave me the check.

<text>Just had dinner with my family at this location! Brian the manager was so helpful with creating a dairy free meal for me with my pre allergy favorite dish! So excited to be able to continue to enjoy the wood grilled lobster, scallops, and shrimp and not have to worry about cross contamination or getting sick! Thank you so much Brian for your concern and diligence. It was truly appreciated! #allergyfriendlyresturant :)<//text>< Pics>

The service was good! I enjoyed for the most part my experience. However, 2glasses of wine for $24.00 is rediculous! I asked for the house selection  (and was told a good choice). But really, not told it was that much! Not that good of a wine! Will not go back!!!!<//review>

At least that's what the 2 guys (looked like tweakers) sitting out front told us. We obviously took their word because the parking lot was empty.

Horrible service. Lobster bisque tastes like baby food. Waiter brought our soup and a minute later our entree. Couldn't finish my first bite of my shrimp medley when the waiter came by to ask if I needed a to-go box.  Everything is very expensive and not worth my time or money. Will not go back.<//review>

The service was good! I enjoyed for the most part my experience. However, 2glasses of wine for $24.00 is rediculous! I asked for the house selection  (and was told a good choice). But really, not told it was that much! Not that good of a wine! Will not go back!!!!< /Text>

My wife and I took are 17 yr old son here on Saturday for the Endless shrimp.  The food was good but the wait time for more shrimp was ridiculous.  10 minutes between each order and only 1 selection at a time.  After waiting for my second order, my wife's dessert showed up first.  This is the reason we stopped coming because they slow each order on the Endless items.<//text>

Food was good, but service was terrible.  We did not have any biscuits while waiting for salads.  When salad arrived, again no biscuits.  We had to ask and no butter was brought.  Again when main entree was broughr no biscuits.  Had to ask for them and butter.  Waitress only came back when we finished our dinner.  She was not that busy as we were earlt before crowds arrived.  Finally, they have six sides you can order.  I ordered the mashed potoes with six tiny shrimp.  Well, they charged $2.99 for them.  I asked to speak to the manager she said you had to read the fine print, well why list them that way....I was so angry that I forgot to complain about the waitress.  They are greedy like everyone else.  I loved going there, but we will not return.  There are other fish houses.< /Text>

This location is so far behind the power curve of their other restaurants.  It's like they feel because they are located in a resort area they don't have to make the average investment.   I have slw always loved RL.  Sad, I'm a full time resident and I gave them a try.  Won't be going back....ever.  The one and done attitude will eventually do them in.  Yep its that bad by comparison.<//text>

< review>
Arrived at noon for lunch.  We were a party of 4.  The place was not busy  but we were seated in the bar area and were the only ones in this area.  This is not my ideal place to sit.  Our server was the bar tender.  Service was lacking big time.  We ordered the fish and chips.  It was grease soaked and the fish was very mushy.  The fettuccini with alfredo sauce and crab had over cooked gummy pasta very little pasty sauce.
The only highlight was the salad and garlic biscuits  were good.  Will not be going back.
Quality of food has really gone down hill.  This used to be my favorite place.</review>

I sent a party of 20 to 25 with for my niece's birthday we made reservations for specific time we got there acenar 20 something people had to wait outside for like 35 40 minutes then when we get in there we're still standing waiting for them to wipe off tables and everything and put the stuff together what's the sense in making reservations if this is what I have to deal with to the service was so disrespectful< /Text>

All you can eat shrimp promotion was gross the shrimp were drowning in fat. Fattening breading and unappetizing high sodium saturated fats. Completly not worth the price.
No fresh shrimp or clean options. You're better off a ordering a regular plate.<//Text>

Unfortunantly I had a party of 7 taking my family out for a nice dinner and the table next to us ruined it with the fact that they we're low lifes trying to get a free meal.

<Review>2 stars. One for the mussles and one for the cheese biscuits. Ceasar Salad was old. First lobster tail was old. Fried shrimp was chewy.... Clam chowder was milk. Not coming back here. Thanks Red Lobster in Riverside by Castle Park for ruining my desire to come back.

PS. Before this experience I raved about Red Lobster. Ugh. Sad</Review></record></dataset><record>

I ordered a rum and ginger-beer and they had none, I ordered a hard cider and cinnamon shot, they had none.. these are more up to date drinks and would really help their patrons have some kind of a choice that is new... The mixed drink I ordered with Madori really was terrible and I sent it back.  I love Midori and it was undrinkable...I truly hope the next time I go there they will have a more up to date and diverse drink menu.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

First restaurant my father and I went to after his lengthy hospitalization (it's like 300 feet from Kaiser Permanente). The food was okay, however the service was a little slow that night. There were not many children, which is a bonus for those whom would like to minimize the probability of louder ambient conversations; personally, it doesn't bother me. If you're looking for some seafood, or surf and turf while attending/visiting Kaiser Permanente, Red Lobster provides a nice alternative to Kaiser's basement (and vending machines).< /text>

Family birthday dinner at Red Lobster in Riverside, food was great, big party and server was on top of everything! Louchino our server (sorry about spelling of his name) was great! Great personality and very funny! Food was good, but even if it wasn't his personality would of made up for it. Biscuits were great! I had the seaside platter, but changed it up with coconut shrimp. Food was correct and very tastie! Great time and very full! Deserts were good, I would not recommend the cookie ice cream desert, it taste like it had been frozen and not fresh, would recommend the chocolate cake with ice cream and share it very sweet! Out server was the best and next time we will ask for his section! Thank you Louchino!< /text>

Family birthday dinner at Red Lobster in Riverside, food was great, big party and server was on top of everything! Louchino our server (sorry about spelling of his name) was great! Great personality and very funny! Food was good, but even if it wasn't his personality would of made up for it. Biscuits were great! I had the seaside platter, but changed it up with coconut shrimp. Food was correct and very tastie! Great time and very full! Deserts were good, I would not recommend the cookie ice cream desert, it taste like it had been frozen and not fresh, would recommend the chocolate cake with ice cream and share it very sweet! Out server was the best and next time we will ask for his section! Thank you Louchino!</Text>

I love the coconut shrimp with the pinacolada sauce. And the ceasar-contreras salad is addictive. The ultimate feast is massive and husband eats every bite. These are are regular orders when we go.< /text>

We had the worst service ever. Every time I go there I have bad service. It took 20 minutes to get our water and bisquets!! Food order was another 20 minutes. And good luck finding a server! It was near closing time and it was so loud from them rushing around cleaning. I'm sorry I just spend 100 on our meals we dont care that you have to clean we want a nice quiet meal. Not hearing staff ask what time it is ever 5 minutes bashing about and ignoring their customers. I also did not appreciate the employees running over every two minutes to the computer near our table asking how long till closing!!! Come on I know you want to go home. When i go to work i do look at my watch every few minutes when its almost time but i don't do that near a client. I was so mad when i left. I love crab and lobster always liked red lobster and have no other options now that Joes crab shack is gone. I live in riverside and will drive to montclair if i want red lobster riverside location was aweful.<//Text>

Did not have good service it looked like our waitress did not like her job she also did not clean up the sauce and just smeared it more. And it took 10 min. To get our drinks. And lastly the waitress did not ask for our sides and just gave us all broccoli.< /review>

<text>Have you ever been served crab legs withOUT any crab meat in the legs ?  It's like the chef ate the meat out of the legs and gave you the empty shells.  This happened to us at this Red Lobster.  It was the craziest experience ever !!!   OMG.....did God forget to put meat in crab legs ?  How did they move in the ocean without meat in their legs ?  Really ???   They tried to scam us .....get us drunk and serve us crab shells without meat.  This sucks...  the management sucked the meat out of the crab before serving.</text>< Pics>

Poor Management, came before dinner rush hour, restaurant was half empty, told us it will be a 5mins wait, it took 30 minutes to get a table in which they put us in at a dirty table in the Bar section (we had 2 small children). Then the Hostess and other staff weren't on the same page. The food was less than desirable, Fish was over cooked and tough. Maybe we hit them on a bad night, but I will not return to this one for overpriced bad food and understaffed Friday Management.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Dear owner.

The place is nice, the food is fine, but I don't understand that with the restaurant almost empty you have to wait 20 minutes to sit at the table.

I also do not understand that it takes almost 40 minutes to serve their dishes and less knowing that they are their specialties.

Also, I don't understand that they have a room in the middle of the hall and they are constantly going in and out and turning on a light to look for things.

Finally, I do not know how in a place of their category they have so much party in the kitchen and they are dedicated to giving voices that can be heard from the living room where customers are eating.

I'm not from the USA but I think they should improve on the details.

Sincerely, José Carlos Martín

Estimado propietario.

El sitio es bonito, la comida está bien, pero no entiendo que con el restaurante casi vacío haya que esperar 20 minutos para sentarse en la mesa.

Tampoco entiendo que tarden casi 40 minutos en servir sus platos y menos sabiendo que son sus especialidades.

Además no comprendo que tengan un cuarto en medio del pasillo y estén entrando y saliendo y prendiendo una luz constantemente para buscar cosas.

Por último no me sé cómo en un sitio de su categoría tienen tanta fiesta montada en la cocina y se dedican a dar voces que se oyen desde el salón dónde están comiendo los clientes.

No soy de USA pero creo que deben mejorar en los detalles.
