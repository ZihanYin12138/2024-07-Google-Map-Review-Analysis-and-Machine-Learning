<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>First time going to this salon and I had a great experience. I was nervous going in for two different reasons: first, salons just reopened after being closed for 2 months because of covid-19. I was pleasantly surprised to see how clean everything was. All the stylists were wearing masks, and they were constantly sanitizing. I was there for hours and saw them sanitizing the chairs after every customer, as well as anything that they used. I was also nervous coming here because it was my first time, and I haven't always had the best experiences with some stylists at other salons, but I was very happy with my results. Juanita really took her time on my hair, listened to what I wanted and delivered. Color and cut looks really good. I will be going back.< /Review><Date>1591146562106< /Date>< user_id>

I brought my mother in to get a perm for her 80th birthday and she left looking so beautiful.  They were very nice and there was no problem with getting my mom around in her wheelchair.  The price was very reasonable.  Thank you ladies for helping to make my mom's day.< /text>

The owner is awesome at short haircuts, but the other employees are a big maybe. My second time in a row going in and getting such an awful haircut. Even when I have a picture of all angle to show them. They need to get it together, and the person who has the last chair towards the Bach door. Her station was just terrible dirty. Usually it’s really clean in there. I have been a long time customer but since they can’t do short haircuts I’m going to have to find someone els.</text>

The first time i got it done the lady cut it  wrong so i had to go back so she can fix it & she did and it came out nice. I went again ans the woman who cut it left it so uneven and when i went back to get it fixed she had to cut more length to fix her mistake😒 i gave them another try and the third time was  the woman cut my hair really good! But she blowed dried it without even asking me.. & theu wanted to charge me for it when she didnt ask in the first place & how was i supposed to know. Then my sister went to cut her hair y la trascilaron. The best one is MONICA<//Text>

I had a horrible experience this past weekend I had called to see how much a haircut was they said 18 I go in I tell my hair dresser how I wanted it I even showed her a picture and we went from there the lady ended cutting my hair above my shoulder length and got a like Dora haircut which was not what I wanted she asked if I wanted her to do my hair I said sure if there’s time she said yes so we proceeded she literally just blow dryed my hair and I was charged 25 dollars I mean I didn’t even get a hair wash when I went in and I got a Dora haircut in which I could’ve done myself there went my long hair 😠< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I love going here with Monica. I always grow my hair very fast when she cuts it. They serve you at the time they are left. I do not give the 5 stars just because it is always full and sometimes it is difficult to grab an appointment when you occupy it, but outside of that I recommend it.

(Original)
Me encanta ir aquí con Mónica. Siempre me crece el pelo rapidísimo cuando ella me lo corta. Te atienden a la hora que quedan. No doy las 5 estrellas solo porque siempre está lleno y aveces es difícil agarrar un appointment cuando lo ocupas, pero fuera de eso lo recomiendo.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Why do not they speak to you with the truth, they tell you that they will tend to you in 20 or 30 minutes ... and spent more than an hour to assist you ..

I'm giving this rating because when I got here they told me it would take 20-30 and it's taken longer than a hour. 🤷🏻♀️

Porqué no te hablan con la verdad, te dicen que te van a tender en 20  o 30 minutos.. y pasó mas de una hora para atenderte..

Bryan Crowley is the best! I've never felt more comfortable talking to insurance companies until recently. He answered all my questions and was so helpful and friendly. The team is so amazing! and I really felt like he cared so much and wanted to get me the best deal possible. I highly recommend this location for all your needs ; )<//review>

<Text>I would like to Thank the State Farm Hermosa Beach team for providing wonderful service. I was initially just looking to insure my business in Manhattan Beach. I ended up switching all my policies because not only did they beat my former broker's prices, they also took the time to walk through all my coverage. I was referred by my real estate agent. I'm so glad he connected me with Charline and her team. I'm not a review person, but this one is well deserved. I'm at Trader Joe's all the time and it's easy enough to make a visit anytime I have a question or pay a bill. I hope this helps. - Sally< /Text>< Rate>

My experience with this branch has been all around a GREAT experience.  From when I first joined a few years ago. I have had the best customer service provides by BRENDA HIDALGO, she's so on top of it. She has always been so detailed with everything. When in doubt of something I would turn to Brenda and get the answers I was looking for. I started  with vehicle  insurance policies and since then, I have added a rental policy. As a customers  service provider myself  for over 20 yrs, I appreciate Brenda's work ethic. it's hard to find  people like her now a days. I totally recommend to ask for her to assist you when you come to this branch.  you are in safe & accountable hands with her.< /Review>

I've been doing all of my business and personal insurance with Charline Espinoza’s State Farm Agency in Hermosa Beach. She was referred by a client of mine. Now, being a client for 10 years, I have had wonderful experiences working with Charline’s team.
We had a few traffic accidents between my business and personal vehicles over the years. They follow- up making sure my claim process was smooth as possible. I felt at ease knowing I had Charline’s team behind me.
The team made sure I am adequately covered and walked me through various coverage options. We  have the good fortune having the lovely, talented, and effervescent Brenda Hidalgo and Jaqueria Demby  who both raised the service level from basic to excellent. We've done business in person and over the phone, and they are always timely , knowledgeable, patient and understanding.
If you understand the value of having an insurance agent, Charline Espinoza agency is your match.  I will say State Farm isn’t the cheapest.  However the peace of mind having amazing customer service is definitely worth it. And they alway try to bundle to make sure you save. Thank you so much Charline - Derek and Ana.</Review>

<time>1565758988462< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>My parents live about 2-3 hours away from downtown, near Magic Mountain, so they can only come to downtown (technically K-Town) once a month about.  We mostly use these PC Room kind of establishments for Print and Copy Usage.
Called the establishment beforehand to confirm it's okay to Print Emails, and surf the Web and such
My parents and I have frequented PC rooms many times, as there are a few near Magic Mountain area and also Sylmar near the edge of LA County.
This particular PC room, for a number of varying reasons from atmosphere to the kind helpful worker who helped us access PDF emails, plus the Great Pricing Makes me want to possibly give 6 Rating if they were possible!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I love this place, very calm and cool. I would definitely recommend it to a friend, every time I’m in La I always stop by and use their computers. The previous owner (Nazeem) is nice and knows his stuff but the new owner (Carl) is just just as good and works just as hard. Whenever I was there Carl would work very hard so make sure the computers are up to date and that everyone was having a good experience. I can’t wait to see how the place changes with new ownership next time I visit La.<//Text><username>Mellow Fellow<//username><userid>110950574820645760969</userid><response>{'time': 1565578543662, 'text': 'Ricardo is a long-time regular at ZeroPingCyberLANd (aka the "New" ZPC LAN Center located at Corner of Olympic/Vermont, in Koreatown!

I came here around 10:30sh weekday evening.

It is the first Cybercafe i visited here in US.

Cafe Attendant: The attendant is nice and approachable. He gladly assist me (even though arrived the cafe when he was playing his game).

Business Hour:
11am-2am (how i wish they are open till 4am)

Location: Located in Koreatown (Vermont and Olympic) in a Plaza. 2nd floor, well lit building and safe location.

Price: $4 per hour (with account) if you sign up for new account it would be $10 which includes 3 hours in the account.

Oh, they accept debit card for payment + .50cents transaction charge.

Toilet: If you are like me who needs to pee alot, the toilet is not located inside the cafe. The toilet is conveniently accessible outside the cafe near the elevator (ask the cafe attendant for the key)

Computer Units: I would say their computer units has a very good specs. it handled dota2 in ultra-high settings without any issue.

Internet is fast. No Lags. No Delays.
Computer peripherals is in good to perfect condition
Huge Monitor
Comfortable Seats.</review>

I love this place it is always so clean and up kept, also the staff is always friendly. The price is very reasonable after going to other places this one is for sure the cheapest at 12 dollars for 5 hours or 20 for all day not bad at all. I usually come here to play league but they have tons of other pc games and also ps3 games whichever is to your fancy.< /Text>

I recently sold my pc and have nothing to do after school. I found this just randomly searching on Google maps for somewhere I can spend time other than the library. Prices are fair, staff is cool desktops are decent enough to play the newest titles including PUBG. Would recommend to anyone.< /Text>

Needed a fast internet to upload a big file, called to see if I was ok and the guy on the phone said no... i called because I’m not going  there to play video game and don’t want to stay in front of the computer, but why would they care if I pay the price per hour ? Not sure...</text>

As you yourself mentioned you were not going to play any games.  Gaming and internet browsing are ONLY things that our business offers. Its not about the money its about what business does or doesn't do. I imagine myself calling BMW dealership and asking for a skateboard and then leaving 1 star because they didn't have a skateboard. Please consider this review and remove it, or visit our Gaming LAN center and play some games and give us review after that. Thank you."}</resp>

Unfortunately our AC is programmed to stay at cool 70 F and employees can't change the temperature.  As i have been told, you were sitting by the entrance and it was around 9-10 pm when you asked to turn up the AC, since the employee couldn't do it, he recommended to open the door for you,  hoping that outside breathe would be enough to make it cooler for you. I do apologize that none of the steps to honor your request were  to your satisfaction, and I promise to give the employees the power to regulate the AC to reasonable temperatures in the future.

I double checked our 30 gaming stations, and all of them had CSGO installed. Not only that, but we also offer 5 center accounts for anyone who desn't have CSGO accounts or if you want to get your friends into CSGO. Regarding food, we don't offer any. We offer a variety of snacks and drinks, but no food, which leads me to the fact you might have made a mistake. Please verify that you reviewed correct business. Also, we always invite you to visit us and enjoy playing CSGO on our 144hz monitors. Cheers, from Zero Ping Cyber"}< /resp></record>

Unfortunately, the people enjoying playing games like League Of Legends, Dota2, CS:GO, Overwatch, Battlefield 1 and many other exciting games, on great gaming stations, can be a little emotional. That is the trade off of the LAN Center, with great gaming experience comes great noises of cheer, and emotions of joy. LAN Centers are not for everyone and we understand it. For that reason we are planning on making a back room for our LAN Center with more PCs, 144 Hz monitors and great noise cancelling headphones for a best experience. If you feel like giving Zero Ping Cyber another chance you can come after our room is ready. We will post updates on Facebook.'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c783bfeafb21:0x6af70ad1dd251863<//gmap_id></record>

Loan cut my hair and she did a great job! It was everything I asked for and I had a coupon for 5 dollars off so my hair cut was only 15 bucks + tip! I would definitely come back again. Call ahead to get your nail on the list so you don't have to wait!</text>

My son has gotten his ears cut by two different stylists at this location.  Both stylists are gone but still. Makes you wonder about Supercuts internal policy of assembly line haircuts. Do them fast no matter the outcome.< /Review>

Use to come here every 2 weeks when I lived near by. Always on point. Always happy with great conversations. I was sad to leave them behind. I still haven't found a salon that takes care of me like them.</text>

Got a trim here with Alexa and she did a fabulous job. Cleaned up my layers really nicely, made my bangs look even better, and gave me a great blow dry on my fine hair. She also gives good head massages during hair washing. Ask for Alexa, she cuts great!</Review>

I've known that Supercuts leaves more hair on the top and back of your head to make you come back sooner for well over a year.  But I foolishly went to this different Supercuts yesterday and was again disappointed at their unwillingness to provide an adequate haircut.  Honestly, I blame myself for coming here after I should have absolutely known better.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Been going here well over a decade. Loan and the rest of the staff are friendly and professional. And take extra care to ensure the cut is done right.

Couldn't ask for a better experience. Highly recommended.< /review>

5 stars ! Really cheap pricing and honestly one of the best haircuts I've had in a while . Last time I went to a " luxury salon " the lady had no idea how to cut or use a machine on the sides . Here they did a fantastic job . Rather than 40 dollars a hair cut it was 19.25 . Great price .<//Review>

I was recommended to Lily I went and asked for a weave low lights being light brown and highlights blonde.  what I got was a disaster.  Black underneath and yellow on top...and if I don't use conditioner it wadded up in a rats nest.  I specially told her the last thing I want is dark highlights and she gave me black....

Maybe she's color blind......and I actually had to pay for this ugly mess....</Text>

I would leave a zero if i could this place is horriable. Went to get mys sons hair cut they said 5 minute wait well that turned into 20 and the dirty looks was everywhere. Needless to say after 20 minutes we left and went across the street to floyds. OMG such a better place they took us in right away smiles and good vibes all around.</text>

Bad Shawn, do better next time. Now that we've gotten the public spanking out of the way, Frank and his guys are incredible at what they do.

I've had and still do have a few performance vehicles with adjustable suspensions which means getting the alignment just right is a "female dog" however this shop gets it right everytime! Tire installation is always spot on as well, never have scratches on my wheels. Excellent service, always!!</text>< Rating>

<review>We have placed our trust in New Tire Warehouse in Santa Clara for several years now not only for our company vehicles but also our personal vehicles. We highly recommend this business. They are professional, efficient and affordable for the quality of tires we purchase. Services are included with the purchase. Thank you, Frank, for always helping us out!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjxO6L2-Ia5GS5zZsKSKuHBl_1QIGBsGFRqDJv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqPOmKCcnO9XV3sVXgPaKETZgvOTRag5Ikv8hM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNslWmUr-V6Tts-U9ui8LCGzwZKHaiP3B_f3FiV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPwQwH9yKShH19149aqbITdC90PachNLVz7YNT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808fca2b771e2581:0x58b6cd864a3309f7< /gmapID></record>

We coincidentally had our tire burst just close to this place, and ended up parking right outside. How does that even happen? But regardless, they noticed and came out and offered help (free of charge)! Though it was a simple tire swap that we were able to do it ourselves, they helped us fill in air in the spare tire.

I really liked the genuine offer of help. It's nice to have such businesses around.< /Review>

returning customer unfortunately the service was a little slow from start to finish. Went in on Friday ordered tires for a Saturday installation at 10am. All was well until it started to get a little busier. The front desk was a little overwhelmed with taking care of everyone and it really slowed things down. Friendly folks but they need help its took over 2 hours to get my tires and I was second in line from opening. I enjoy supporting local smaller chains but I really would like a little more organization. I wasn't in a hurry so it wasn't bad for me, but, for someone in a hurry it would definitely be a bad deal.< /review>

Came in for a tire change and was told an hour to an hour and 30 mins but after one hour with them not having in vehicles other than mine in the shop with the tires off, they gave a new ETA of 1-2hrs. Worst customer experience. The employees are just messing around in the back and the associate that helped me seemed like he didnt want to do anything. Will not come here again.....vehicles entered after me and were still done before me...worst customer service Iv ever had.<//review>

I got my brand new tires installed and all wheels alignment about six months ago.  Few days ago, my front driver side begin to develop a tiny leak between the tire and the rim that would deflate my tire completely in two days.  I called up Tire Warehouse, and they told me to bring it next day.  I brought my car there, they took a look and fixed the tiny leak that was caused by my rim chrome plate peeling without charging me a penny.  Now, that is customer service.  I have been using this place for my tires and alignment for the past 20 years, and they never failed me.<//text>

Had a drill bit (!) stuck in a tire and they took care of it right away, patching it up - I was back on the road in less than an hour. Great customer service and prompt action!</Text>

<Text>This place is the best alignment shop I have ever been to. They explained everything in details, patient, professional. Alignment could be tricky, since it is linked with suspension and other major structural components.  They explained all the details, inspected the suspension for me. It is a really cool experience to be here. They know what they are doing, and they charge absolutely reasonable! 4 wheel alignment for my Jetta only 89 bucks! It is much much cheaper than the dealer. My car drives perfectly after the alignment fixed. Definitely recommend this shop to everyone.</Text>< time>

<rating>1</rating><text>I assumed they inflated my tires to the proper psi, boy was I wrong. After taking a trip of around 500 miles I checked my tires cold psi and it was set to 45 psi. That's 12 psi over the recommended setting and over the max inflation set by Goodyear!!! Add the 2-3 psi increase of warm tires and my brand new tires might have just been compromised for safety!!! Besides that, I requested a rotation and they did not do it, but I caught it before leaving and made sure they did it. I now have doubts that they balanced the wheels. I guess it's why they only charge $50 for install. I'd rather pay a little more and get it done right the first time. To be fair, the office staff was friendly and professional. I would have rated them 5 stars if not for the overinflated tires. That totally defeats the purpose of buying new tires... For safety!!<//text>< pics>

We have been purchasing new tires from New Tire Warehouse in Santa Clara for several years now. They are easy to find, on Comstock St. off Lafayette and Central Expressway. Parking is very tight. Frank is great to work with. We purchase all our new tires for our company vehicles and personal vehicles here. Their service is outstanding and their prices are reasonable. They are very easy to work with.< /Review>

<Review>I had tires from tire rack mounted and balanced and a wheel alignment done. The entire service took just over an hour with no appointment needed, and the prices were great.

Edit: After getting home, I noticed that the tire pressure was quite a bit higher than the manufacturer recommended 36 psi. I got 38, 39, 42, 44 across the 4 tires several hours after I parked for the night. This was easily fixed but probably worth mentioning.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I was referred to Benzy (mechanic) who works in this place by my car’s previous owner. He ends up being professional mechanic and nice person, unfortunately on the day when I changed tires and made alignment he was not there. What happened other mechanics didn’t screw bolts all the way and my car was terrible vibrating in highway (I was lucky to enough that tire didn’t lose tire and I didn’t fall to accident). The most sad part was manager Frank who was in front desk didn’t even wanted to listen what happened to the car while he clearly understood this is 100% fault of his team. Benzy next day (it was not his mistake) changed my brake brackets and fixed entire tire on his own when Frank didn’t put any effort to solve the issue.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This was excellent!!! I had the avocado burger, and my boyfriend had kale burger. Both were amazing. There’s a little patio in the back where you can sit in the sun . But it’s a quick bite kind of place, no restroom and limited space. Now stop overthinking and GO THERE. Worth every penny</review>

I've been going for about a year to the one on Abbott Kinney. The first few visits were great!  Then they got sloppy. You can watch them make your food. Since Jordan (who says he's the manager) started working there,everytime I go and he's there it's a "fight".  He touches food without gloves, breaks the bread, overcooks the burgers and breaks them,  doest heat up the grilled onions. All this off and on, but he did ALL these things on my last visit on Wednesday night. When I refused the burger he added it to a pick up order to some unsuspecting soul!  I ordered fries, and they were done and packed right away, so they sat there for about a half hour. I told him,  "those aren't my fries, they've been there a long time, they're cold." He took them and put them in the oil for about 15 seconds and gave them to me. The kicker is that he had just made a whole basket of fries!! I demanded my money back,  $4 and he never fills the container. BUT, THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO CARE!!  There's a Latin lady who I've seen and has made my food, she is AWESOME. And Jesus makes the most TERRIFIC salads! I'll still go there, if I go and Jordan is there, I'll leave and go across the street to Butcher's Daughter. I'm not doing it anymore, paying $30 and getting aggrivated  to get your food???? No, I don't think so.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><review>This place is a MUST. To be honest, I was in the area to try another vegan restaurant but the wait was so long that I came here instead. I ordered not thinking much, I mean falafals arent usually something I get excited for. HOWEVER, Fala Bar changed my mind. This place has the best falafals I've ever had. I got the Kale Burger, which was amazing. I know, I know, how can a kale burger be good? Trust me I told the cook to change the name because it's too good to just be called something that sounds so unappetizing. The burger was huge and the falafals were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside but moist and flavorful on the inside. The Tahini sauce, veggies, and everything put together was so fresh and delicious. The customer service was also amazing! I can't wait to go back!

My only recommendation: a friend of mine ordered a variety of falafal flavors and had a difficult time identifying all of them. I'd suggest differentiating them for customers so we know what to order next time.</review><user>118411485511006564468< /user>< time>

<text>Great experience!! I would highly recommend this laundromat for everyone that wants to do their laundry in a clean establishment. They have many machines that fit a lot of clothes. Also, they have vending machines for snacks and drinks, and even vending machines with soaps and detergent which is great if you forget yours! Overall, I love coming here to do my laundry especially because it’s peaceful and very well attended. 10/10< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>117644670995775799714< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

When to do my laundry for the first time in the morning, Once i got to the door  i saw this lady cleaning and i ask her if she could explain me how everything work  there, she answered me very kindly and told me of course and  began to explain and she also told me about other service like fluff & fold, wash and  go and also that you guys pick up and delivery the sound awesome to me. I love how she explain me everything 100%, also noticed there where  no kids running around. I will definitely recommend  Laundry 360 with my family and friends.

This laundry 360 used to be just a Laundromat way back.. (the name of the place)

A lot has changed.
More cleaner! 👏🏻
And they have wash & fold services for people who wants their laundry done.
They have free drying now! Every wednesdays.
And I know they have days that have free pizza and discounted loads.

I've been going to this place since 2010.
And it's way better now!
New washers too!< /review>

< review>
I recently went, during the morning and I met one of the laundromat attendants, her name was Sandy. She was very nice and polite. Her customer service was amazing. As soon as she seen me take my laundry hampers out of my car she asked if I needed carts. She helped me take my things inside. She also showed me the kind of machines they had and told me the prices. Sandy explained to me the weekly specials. I now know Wednesday is FREE dry. That’s a plus. The laundrymat is super clean. The time I was there I constantly seen Sandy mantaining the laundrymat clean. They also have vending machines that are very modern and easy to work. Everything is always stocked up. They also have an area to charge phones. They have FREE wifi. They have TVs with both English & Spanish channels. Before coming to Laundry 360 (On Main St.) I disliked the thought of having to go to a laundry mat and do laundry. But with a clean laundrymat, nice and welcoming attendents, I will now enjoy it. I strongly encourage people to check this location out. Thank Laundry 360 & Sandy!<//review>

<text>All the washers and dryers are always very spic and span clean 🧽. And the restroom is very clean and smells always good. And also the staff keeps cleaning 🧹 every time and also very helpful , polite and friendly.... And of course they have a FREE WIFI connection and a cellphone charging station with a electric outlet and a USB outlet too.  I will give this facility a 5 STAR and a 5 THUMBS UP 👍👍👍👍👍...  🙂<//text>< Gmap_id>

Clean facility and new machines are nice! I go here all the time even before they renovate everything. The only negative experience i had was today. Their 8 loads machine broke as i was using it and when i notified the lady there about it, i was immediately blamed that i overload it. I probably did but how could you tell that? There is no warning or whatsoever and no signs in the laundromat. As a consumer i want to get the best value out of my money so i put as much as i could. I mean the machine worked as it proceeded to wash my stuffs but it broke in the middle. Anyway, i was told that they will not refund me as it was my fault that the machine broke. That’s when i start to reason with the lady and we reasoned some more but i eventually got a refund. She then told me as i was pulling my stuffs out that she will count how many i sheets i put and she will take a picture so that her boss will believe her. I didn’t mind but it kinda paint a negative light on the owner but the lady was trying her best to be nice so dont fire her. Anyway, ill still use this facility but when they start being strict and control you then that might be bad for business. The rest of the reviews here are accurate.</Text>

Self-Service. You Must Bring Enough Cash Before Hand. They run on quarters which you can get with the cash to coin converter machine inside. But Carry All The Cash You Need. If you are driving well it will be easier to get to. Otherwise it will be quite difficult. But once there it won't take very long to leave if you have a small load.<//Review>

Small area laundrymat in a small strip mall. Always overcrowded on weekends ( like most laundry's), as people do wash mostly then. It's been remodeled, with newer washers/ dryers and vending machines. They also have a clerk who works and does laundry services on site. Convient.<//review>

<Review>Great place. Helpful Staff and everything works! Free wifi and stocked up vending machines . One of the best laundromats I've been to in a while. It's clean with access to paper towels and a sink, bathroom is spotless and only for customer use. Decent restaurants in the shopping center which includes a convenience store. Ample parking as well. Large dryers that will dry 3 loads of washed laundry easy. They also have a credit/debit card pay washer to wash your big comferters or blankets. I really recommend this Laundromat.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd3512b46c2df5:0x4bb4a0bda23cdc54< /Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>114856189372317978611< /UserId.><time>1614880858256< /time>< rating>

Need more single load machines.  I use double load front loaders and my socks got stuck in the front gap and did not get clean.  I know it is a machine design and would happily use single top loaders but when there are people actually waiting for the single load machines what choice do I have?</Review>

I am extremely picky when it comes to my training facilities and have had recent issues at another facility and chose to come here instead and was very happy with my choice to do so. I am currently 16 weeks out from competing in the Figure Division at the Tahoe Show on 8/14, so my training time is very serious to me and I need my training equipment to be working and accessible and I found this to be the case in Manteca. The staff understands how serious my fitness goals are and provides an experience for me that is catered to what I need. It is very obvious that the General Manager, Sean, takes his job seriously and keeps his staff on-point and up-beat at all times. Great Job!< /Text>< userid>

Nice . Clean. Have to work on checking restrooms more ( paper towels run out quickly or dispenser not working properly. Some body area machines are left outside that isn't inside.  Hard to walk and handicap therefore it is  difficult to move from one area to another.< /Text>

The gym is nice. But honestly it gets very packed and there aren’t enough machines / room in the free weights section.. it was nice when because of covid there was an outdoor gym in the parking lot since it was very spacious.. but as of now it just seems to always always be waaay too packed.< /text>

I love the staff they make me feel like family. Amanda the manager is excellent Brandon the personal trainer is phenomena. Yvonne at the front desk has the spirit of hospitality with her warmed and friendly smile. In fact my husband is a member of 24 hour gym. I've been trying to get him to convert and he finally did this month. I love the facility they keep it clean kudos to the person who cleans up the bathroom I can't remember her name but she does an outstanding job. Working out is hard enough but when you have a place like in shape it's like going to your second home. Thanks for an awesome experience.</review>

During my 5mo journey with my trainer Justus I’ve come a long way with physical and mental health. He’s encouraged me and showed me the correct form, he changed both the way I work out and feel about working out. I decided to start with personal training because I was getting sluggish and I felt I had all this mass weighing me down. Previously the number on the scale was a challenge to accept. Now I realize it’s so much more about the body fat percentage and more importantly progress.

Some days I really didn’t want to train, it’s hard work to achieve substantial/sustainable results and to maintain it. Every week I knew I’d at least train once and feeling the change in my body pushed me to want to do more. Before I started training diabetes was knocking at my door. If I continued my bad eating habits and little exercise there’s no doubt in my mind the health concerns would keep racking up. Today I am healthy, happier, and my head is clearer than it’s been in a long time. I’m starting new goals and pushing myself harder than ever possible. Justus as my trainer has improved my quality of life. I know what it feels to truly have a great workout.

Thank you.</text>

Love the gym and staff, but it ended up to expensive each month. 44 dollars a month to be dedicated only to one gym only, was a bit much. I had to sign up somewhere that was affordable, and even at this other gym, it is 21.99 a month. I got everything solved with the corporate office, and they even talk off the fees. I gladly paid my bill, and hope to see better deals in the future.</review>

<Review>I love the yoga classes.  My favourite is Robin (Robyn?) on Friday evenings.  It's not too hard, not too easy.  If you are new to yoga, go on Monday evenings as Al does a fairly easy class.  If you want a harder class, go on Wednesday evenings as Sylvia works does the toughest classes.  She is fun and yet works ya.  Do it's nice to have different styles & levels to choose from.</Review>< username>

This inshape is more like a racquet club.  It is by the marina in Stockton and is more upper class not so many people all the time.  The atmosphere is great being right by the delta. The outdoor jacuzzi is large but is rough to sit on and needs to be refinished and smoothed down.  The out door pool is sectioned off in lanes for swimming so just going in and playing or lounging in the pool is not available all the time.< /Review>

<review>This is not my regular gym, but there are some things that I love about Manteca that keep me going there as well. I've never had less than a good interaction with the staff at this In Shape. Last week I went in looking for a certain machine but unsure whether they had it. Amanda (who was at the desk when I checked in) called over a trainer and asked him to show me the location of the machine I was searching for. He took me to the first of several machines and asked what I was looking for. I was able to describe the exercise I was replacing in my workout and he took me directly to a machine that did exactly what I needed.

There are always towels, the locker room has always been clean, I LOVE that they have a separate changing room, and the fans in the treadmills are amazing. There are almost always enough free weights (though there could be more of the light weights outside of Group X) and kettlebells and I rarely have to wait for a machine.

I have been to Manteca less than 10 times but have had multiple positive engagements with Amanda, the manager. As I've been an In Shape member for nearly 18 months and seen my regular club's manager maybe 30 times, this stands out to me. (To be fair, I work out very early at my home club and later in the day when I make it to Manteca.)

Overall, I'm very impressed with this club.</review><user_id>101465184045564772056< /user_id>< gmap_id>

Thank you for fixing the handicap shower. There is now a soap dispenser located within reach of the handicap shower chair. Now there is a bench in the shower to set on and get dressed. Thank you in shape for fixing this oversite asap. I am changing my rating. I will visit other gyms to ensure standards are kept high through out the company when it comes to the mobility impared.< /Review>

<userid>107752475614606623013< /userid><Time>1524002014416<//Time><Text>Edit after the Reply: So is she not the manager? Who is he??! Did front desk lie to me? Does anyone at this company know what's going on or does everyone have their heads in the clouds? I'm tired of being blown off when all I want is some questions answered... Point simple: If you would like to be respected and valued then go to another gym, if you want to be taken for granted and only seen as a money sign then I'm sure Amanda (or he?? Whoever that may be) would love to take your money.

I just wanted to first start off by saying I used to love this club, before the remodel (crazy as that sounds!) I just feel it was much more respected as well as the members.My husband and I have been platinum members for at least two years now (even though I do not need to be but I like the freedom) and I have seen my share of management come and go but the young lady in the office (or should I say never in the office) is the worst I have ever seen!!
Honestly I thought the bearded gentleman was the manager but after several days (weeks honestly) of waiting to speak with him about the towels stinking up the lockerroom, nasty gross panties left out in the open and even after several so called 'housekeeper sweeps.' She was under my nose the whole time, texting, playing on her phone with the other teenagers in the office behind the front desk and just ignoring any general questions the members may have... I would not like to be contacted, or offered any free junk. I believe the kid working the front desk told me her name was Amanda, I'm sorry but this location lost a member today. I'm sick of it and I don't think I'm the only one tired of watching the young staff neglect such a beautiful location after the remodel but I guarantee it will go down hill as a direct reflect of management.< /Text></record>

Solid gym with nice workers and Amanda is an excellent manager and extremely nice, highly recommended for families with children.  Also recommend going to the manager rather than corporate for any problems, you get a faster and better response.</review>

I like reading these comments and seeing people complain about stupid things.  I mean your at a gym were a lot of people go to, sorry everything isn't perfect.  There are times of the day its really busy because obviously that's when it is most convenient for them.  they all manage to get a workout in and sorry you don't have the patience to try... who cares that the associates are talking, they honestly shouldn't have to greet you or say hi, you're there to workout.  I love the place, i have gotten results with my workouts. I think people just need to try harder...< /Review>

<Review>Newly remodeled Looks good. However, The last 3 weekends there hasn't been any Housekeeping service until after 4pm. No Towel service had to use paper towels to dry off. Mens locker room was filthy, disgusting and unsanitary. Puddles of Urine underneath urinals, All toilets filthy and disgusting stained with feces. Even worse was the Steam room, Someone had stepped in what I assume was Dog feces and tracked it in steam room. I told front desk and was told Housekeeping didn't get there until 4:00 so it was still there 2 hours later. I even took photos to show front desk and let them know my concerns,  left my name and number for management to call me, that was Sunday and it is now Thursday and no one has reached out to me. I hesitant to go back this weekend but I think I will go back to see if anything has changed from the last 3 weekends I visited.
Revised:
Not much has change since my first complain in October. Today, Sunday 4/22/18 230pm I complained to front desk about the strong smell of Urine in the Steam room and He agreed that it did smell like urine and said Housekeeping will be here a 4pm and left it for housekeeping. He didn't even close the Steam room. Just left as is, So disgusting and unsanitary. When I asked to speak to management I was told that there wasn't even management on site. It is Obvious that this club is under budget for housekeeping and nothing is being done about it. I will now take my concerns about the unsanitary conditions of this disgusting club to the Neighborhood Social media page with photos and video in hope that by blasting these unsanitary conditions publicly will get your club to take Sanitation and cleanliness more seriously. I don't have this problem at your Tracy or Modesto clubs Just Manteca East Inshape Sport club.
Thanks for Nothing
Same disgusting and unsanitary health club since October 2017 when I first brought this to your attention in October 6 months ago.<//Review>< pictures>

There is another gym in manteca that's super cheap like 5 or 10 bucks a month has far more stable machines

A little update being in this gym for more then 2 years! They bathroom are filthy pee stains everywhere they dont put efforts to clean they just want to look pretty at the front desk. However, they did some advancements to the gym i would say 20 percent.

Michael i am not going to email you to tell how to do your job. You need to keep your eyes open and look for all this. Like they say you get what you pay for in this case its the opposite!

For the money you charge we deserve a little better thats all i am saying look at the gym around stockton they are far more superior then what we get here in this gym

You call this place Inshape. However the truth is most of your trainer are no were to be in the shape infact if they dono how to shape themself how could they ever help people acheive their goals. For example An Apple tree does not produce grapes.

I feel sorry for people wasting their thousands for dollars for gaining nothing.<//text><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

Worst service ever I went to add another car to my policy and they didn’t do it saying that I had to get a new policy so that I would pay less they wanted like 300 dollars to change my policy so I got out called my cousin that works at fiesta but another location and she did it over the phone ended paying only 65 bucks and plus my cousin said they had left a note on my file saying make him change policy don’t take any payments</review>

Representatives are extremely rude and I have never dealt with a more unprofessional place in my life. scammed me into an insurance policy and then told me that it was my fault. one of the reps got me insurance and then the dude quit a few days later the insurance company is now canceling my insurance saying that I am at high risk. Called fiesta back have been getting the runaround ever since.< /Text>< pictures>

I just had the best experience here!!! The agents are so polite. Very friendly environment. And their rates are amazing!!! I would definitely recommend Fiesta to anyone! And they pay you $25 cash for referring anyone to them!! I think that's pretty cool. Thank you for helping me with my insurance needs.<//Text>

I’ve been with fiesta for 8 years and I wouldn’t change it for anything else! And now that my wife diamonique is the supervisor makes it even better! Highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for good reliable insurance. If I could give 20 stars I would!</Review>

<review>Recently got my insurance through fiesta. As a young driver everyone was charging me really high monthlys on a 2015 since i needed the full coverage on it.  But Susana was able to find me a very good rate, without hurting my wallet. She made me feel like family with her amazing customer services. She explained all my coverages to me and answered any questions i had. Thank you again Susana for all your help!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Please please do your self a favor and go elsewhere for insurance!! Sure they advertise pretty well with their bird outside and all and let me not forget about how they throw in the Spanish speaking but as a Latina I am very disappointed in this company . This company is based on lies and it's sad that they target the Hispanic community the most. I was once am employee of this company and we were trained to get the most money out of hard working customers just like you and me . We were trained to rank up the broker fee as high as possible and had a daily email to remind us to get the most cash out of hard working immigrants like our parents . Sure are parents go go the pajarito Insurance because it advertises Latinos but we are trained to get the most out of each customer with high broker fees . If you have this insurance please go elsewhere they are ripping you off pay close attention nothing ever adds up 500$ broker fee come on now and trust me you'll be glad if you go elsewhere. This place is a fraud and racist towards Hispanics despite their advertising<//Review>

I just had horrible service from this Fiesta place. The girl didn’t even greet me and when she was handing me my change she just left it on the counter rather than handing it to me. Prior to assisting me she was very kind to a man that she assisted before me, and once she was done helping him she just went straight to her paperwork knowing that she had other people waiting. If I didn’t make a phone call and said that I was waiting to be assisted she wouldn’t have ever helped me out. Some of these workers seriously need to be grateful to have a job, and not give customers a rude attitude because without customers there’s no source of income.< /review>

Very bad first experience.  Not always good to go through a middle company (which is what Fiesta is).  It was my first time getting car insurance, so I went through Fiesta Auto Insurance in Madera (which is lead by the same person who works in the Dinuba office).  I paid my first monthly payment and starting fee of $200.  Things went normal at first:  I got my next bill in the mail, went in and paid it off three days before the due date and also upgraded my insurance policy for a total of $138.  Two weeks later, my insurance was canceled because Fiesta never submitted my payment to Reliant General, the company through which they were giving me insurance.  My bill for my next payment never came in the mail... It took a while before I found out I was driving without insurance.

I went into Fiesta and the first worker put the blame completely on me.  He tried to send me on my way, but I refused.  I spoke to a second worker and started a new policy for $79.  He did give me $63 back because my last policy didn't work.  At this point, I still believed the last policy cancellation was my fault.  I then received a cancellation fee in the mail from Reliant General for $45 along with a warning for "collection proceedings".  I would later receive a verbal warning "We will send our collectors."

After some investigation, taking time and energy out of my days, I finally found out the fault was on Fiesta.  To this day, no one has admitted fault and apologized for it.

Over the next two months, I tried to get in contact with the manager/accountant, Andrea, (who actually works at an office in a different city, Dinuba), to fix my $45 cancellation fee.  In the last few weeks, I was playing a little game of phone tag with her, as she would never call me back.  Andrea finally did part of her job and contacted me.  She never admitted mistake or apologized, but when asked why my payment wasn't submitted, she simply stated, "I don't know why."  Also, she decided not to pay my $45 fee though she knew it was the mistake of her company.

Even after all the frustration and being cheated out of some money, I cannot break away from my current Fiesta policy as I have invested too much money already.

Extremely bad first experience.  At least I didn't get in a car wreck during those 2 1/2 weeks I was unknowingly uninsured.</text>

<Text>I mentioned it was our first time and the employees sang a song welcoming us. A delicious frozen treat with the option to mix up to three (3) flavors and I recommend adding the soft-serve ice cream on top!

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Went on a Saturday afternoon. Line was about 5 people deep, which was about a 5 minute wait. At this time only one party is allowed per transaction. The cashiers were nice and explained the concept of the establishment. I ordered a medium mango, watermelon and pineapple combo. Only took a few minutes to get my order. Very refreshing, tropical and hit the spot on a warm day. Very colorful interior. Overall I highly recommend coming here.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Happy Ice is amazing even on a cold day in LA.  I love that they are dairy free so you can indulge as you wish and be worry-free of an impending belly ache.  It’s the bomb and you have to go and try it for yourself.  Each scoop is a work of art in itself and the crew are always smiling and you can tell they like what they do, so good vibes always can expected here.  Delicious and an LA staple for those who know, so now you know!  Go :)<//text>< user_name>

<review>They have a bunch of great flavor options. Happy Ice is like a  gourmet shave ice/slurpee. Flavors include mango, cherry, watermelon, blueberry lemon/strawberry and Rainbow Rocket .  Makes you feel Happy for only 5 bucks! You can select up to 3 flavors. Sometimes there is a long long line but it is worth the wait.< /review>< user_name>

<Review>Solid ice cream, definitely has the edge against places like Saffron and Rose in terms of quality of ice cream. I tried their rose water cream and their lavender flavors - both which were excellent. Overall, it's more on the creamy side and less on the sweet side which I like. Minus one star because of how expensive it is. Seven dollars for a double scoop? I could get a meal for that money.</Review>< pictures>

HAPPY ICE, HAPPY LIFE 💛💛💛
So happy that @happyice made it to Arizona & crossing my fingers that one day they open a spot in Az. 🤞🏼 For now check them out in California! Make sure you try all of there amazing creation of flavors /combinations! Pictured are the “All-Star” ,”Rainbow Rocket” & “Time Machine”. Take a bite of these treats & you’ll be in love & wanting more 🤤 . All Star & Time Machine are a must try!
My Personal Favorite was definitely the All Star! It tastes just like a “BombPop!”💙 The Time Machine definitely tasted like a “Big Stick” from the ice cream man! . If you can’t decide which flavor definitely try the Rainbow Rocket!</text>

<Text>It was my first time visiting Happy Ice LA on Melrose. It's like $6 for a large, a little pricy, but it's totally worth it! The spoons change color when cold and the cups are biodegradable. I loved the rad monopoly money! Collect 7 happy ice bills and you get a complementary icey. I ordered the 🌈🚀 which has all the flavors & was absolutely delicious and refreshing!<//Text><userid>107456248449764313545< /userid><time>1593821749343< /time>< username>

I have wanted to try Happy Ice since before the brick and mortar opened but hadn't had a chance until recently. I went on a very hot day and they did not dissapoint. The shave ice was a great texture and had an overall tart flavor which paired with the vegan soft serve was a really great way to blend flavors. Melrose Ave is a fun place to hang out and couldn't ask for a better sweet treat on a very hot day.<//Review>

<Text>A neat ice cream parlor we stumbled upon while roaming SF. Very impressed by the rich and exotic flavors. Got a "double smidge" with a scoop of Aztec Chocolate and Earl Grey & Lavender. Quite the interesting combo. The Aztec chocolate was certainly one of the more "spicier" of the spicy chocolates I've tasted. Earl Grey & Lavender had very robust flavors of both. Very delicious and authentic taste! I'm glad we stopped by.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Its good, but the heavier black girl was kind of rude. She also did not sing the song like my friend told me they did for her. But my friend did go there with a friend of the happy ice place. It should be the same across the board for new people.<//text>

<review>The ice honestly tastes so good and I don't know what alien technology they use but the ice doesn't melt fast. U get the same consistency until the last bite.

The ice flavors are so good. The large is too large, literally felt like a heart attack. The line is long but it’s worth the wait!<//review>

<Text>Not really following any Covid guidelines. Waited outside in the heat after cramming us into the store just small enough so no one had 6 ft. Servers, they can't be bothered to answer your questions. I asked how much, she showed me 3 little cups.  She showed me & said 4oz. , 6oz., 8oz. I said., again, how much. She told me the same thing. I said how much do they cost?  She said $4,$5,$6.. I said thank you & walked out.
How to lose a customer in one visit. Too bad. It really looked inviting.</Text>< Rate>

So yummy!!! I love how the ice holds the flavor all the way to the end and doesn't just melt and turn into juice right away. Very great price for a great treat!!! Catch their truck on Melrose 🌈</text>

Coming from Philly to LA I was very happy to find this place. Hands down the best water ice I have ever had and the service is always spectacular.</review>

< review>
Fantastic ! Heard about this place on a local news station And it was worth it! It was super hot today so an Italian ice sounded perfect . The parking in the area is a bit tricky but not impossible. The line at 4pm was a good 45 mins and wrapped around to behind the barbershop . So just plan accordingly and bring a hat and water since you are in direct sun in the line . The product is great and the staff is very friendly and are moving quickly for a small place ! I loved the rocket swirl which has every flavor and the pineapple was my fav ! Worth a try !! Costs 6 bux for a large<//review>

Crazy flavor combinations made to look like wizardry in a cup. I don't know how they make it look so beautiful.  It's like eating delicious art. Being from philly I would say this is legit. You can't even compare this to Rita's or John's or Philly Water Ice Co or really any other ice product out there. Maybe it's close to Polish water ice in consistency, but the flavors and taste are just in a different league. Lamier, the owner was super friendly and outgoing, nice guy. It's always appreaciate when the owner takes a moment of their time to chat. Can't say enough about how good this product is.</text>< Name>

Best ice cream around. Pistachio is best favor I've tried so far. There is always a line out the door. So be prepared to wait. Staff is always friendly.</Text>

<Text>Peeeerrrrrfect!!!! Everything about their ice cream is great! And on top of it all they’re vegan friendly. Great flavors, you can mix and match up to 3. Today was my first time trying it and definitely will be back. I got a large and it was well worth the $6<//Text>< gmapID>

Moving to California you can’t find food like East Coast food. No one in the LA area knows what water ice is! and no one certainly knows how to make it right. Rita’s Italian ice isn’t even good on the west coast. So when I tried this it took me back to being on the boardwalk in Wildwood NJ eating Polish water ice. It’s so smooth and delicious</Review>

<review>Last night I went to the 626 night market in Arcadia and the first thing that I found was the Happy ice stand and I got the small rainbow and I was amazing and refreshing. I’m going to follow your truck to get some next time. Thank you my whole family tried it and loved the delicious flavors together 👍</review>< Gmap_id>

The best New York Italian ices coming from a true New Yorker. Very big portions for a good price. It’s hard to contact them sometimes to find out where they are (bc it’s a truck and moves).</text>

I remember when they first opened, I was on Melrose and the nice lady at the front gave me a free sample. It was delicious.

Now, two years later, boy have they GROWN! Multiple trucks, multiple locations in one day, private parties... you name it.

In the hot dry summer of LA, happy ice is the perfectly refreshing, sweet but not too sweet, light dessert that is sure to brighten your day and cool off your body.

Color changing spoons too!

Pro tip: they are almost always at the vegan fair on Bakman in Noho on Sundays.

Suggestion: Can you guys get sour spray? A lot of Hawaiian ice trucks have it, it gives a nice sour kick to any icy desserts (;

Love it!</Text>

Good vibes and good ice!

I actually got happy ice from their truck just now on Sepulveda in Van Nuys near Petco. I was about to walk away because it didn't have the toppings I pictured wanting. I also wasn't that excited about any of the flavors.  The salesgirl was so nice that I felt guilty and got a small... I was so wrong..first off, I got the rainbow flavor (all of them).

The texture was unlike (in a Better way) any shaved ice place I've ever had. It was almost the texture of ice cream!
The way the flavors were stripes-- all separated-- but you could eat an individual color and it was that flavor-- allowed me to taste each flavor and they were ALL good, even the lemon.  NO TOPPING NEEDED.
I could go on... but I'm afraid you won't read it and you must!
To all skeptics- just try it, you'll be more than pleasantly surprised. I'm not a natural reviewer--- but the whole package was such a good experience I was compelled to.

Awesome touch with the color changing spoon.< /Review>

<Review>I must share with the world My HAPPY ICE experience. There was a group of young kids with a colorful idea that left a smile every time I looked for a fault. The truck itself sparked My brain and made Me walk over to find out what was going on. When I reached the side of the truck serving counter, All I saw were people (multicultural) eating heaps of something colorful from these spoons that turned colors. My brain is on overdrive with curiosity now, as I start to approach the line, I’m listening at peoples conversations about what they are eating. Fruity, tasty, refreshing, cool we’re just some of the comments I heard. I’m sold now, I’m in line! By the way the wait wasn’t to long because this young guy approached Me with a HAPPY ICE shirt and said HI with a big grin. He said 1st time trying Happy Ice, I respond yes. Well, I got a free sample. 2 words, I’m Hooked ;)))). Hey I enjoyed the sample so much I brought a medium water ice as HAPPY ICE calls it and a warm pepperoni cheese pretzel. The pretzel was a Out-of-the-world, 1 of a kind type snack. I’ve never imagined anything of the sort, Puzza pretzel, HAPPYICE calls it. Hey, this was such a treat, staff was inviting, everybody in the area eating HAPPY ICE actually looked Happy. This was a win win experience!! Oh! If your wondering, YES I’VE been back quite often, I even know the owners name. SO, Go experience the HAPPY ICE Movement, go Support this young entrepreneur, PEACE, LOVE & HAPPYICE. Oh, don’t forget to take your pic on the HAPPYICE truck backdrop. ☮️ 💜&HI😊<//Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The taste is okay, but there is nothing special about it.
It's a refreshing sorbet ice cream, so it's good to eat it on a hot summer day.
I visited it because it was a restaurant, but I don't think I need to come here to come.
It is recommended if you have a refreshing dessert when you come to Melrose Street.

(Original)
맛은 괜찮지만 그닥 특별할것은 없는 맛입니다.
상큼한 셔벗 아이스크림이기 때문에 더운 여름날에 먹기 좋을듯 하네요.
맛집이라 하여 찾아갔던건데, 굳이 이곳을 오기 위해 찾아 올 필요까지는 없을 듯 합니다.
멜로즈 거리 오셨을때 시원 상큼한 디저트가 당기신다면 추천합니다.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Typical establishment that employs young people to produce something that looks better than it tastes. The taste is not great water with a lot of sugar and some coloring. It is also expensive. I do not recommend it.

Típico establecimiento que emplea gente joven para producir algo que luce mejor que sabe. El sabor no es gran cosa agua con mucho azúcar y algún colorante. Además es caro. No lo recomiendo.< /text>

Smaller version than what they have in a big city. Much less variety of products but still seem to have a little bit of everything. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly much more so than I'm used to in other cities.</Text>

<Text>When I was there one of the store workers asked me about my pain that I was having and she pointed it out on herself where it was exactly without me even telling her where my pain was and she said a prayer for me holding my hand while my husband and oldest granddaughter was picking out a belt for my oldest granddaughter it was super fantastic! She was an African American girl very nice tall too! Very appreciative of her praying for me! So sweet  so thank you for her Walmart! Much love 💟💟💟💟💟 goes out to her! May God bless her always forever infinity and beyond times! 😁😎 from Missy Hernandez forever grateful! 1-16-2020 Thursday</Text>< Pictures>

No complaints. Had everything I was looking for. They're starting to order more stuff now since things are improving a little economically. Great customer service</Text>

Walmart definitely has some characters in there but has everything simple you might need. I filled up my apartment with household items from there and everything looks good and was cheap.. will be back but be prepared and don't be surprised at the people you see in there.</review>

<text>This store has had homeless problems.
Things like socks you have to ask for help to get out of
A locked cabinet.
Many items they take to the register with your'e name.
In order not to get ripped off.
Not a store I shop in offten.
Under staffed.
Under stocked.
Treat everybody like a thief.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I went to the check out in hygiene area. The lady working register seemed miffed that i wanted to check out there. It was so busy. Why only 1 counter open in front besides self check out. Every time i go here there's only one check out counter open, WHY???? Service sucks for that reason..... Otherwise its okay here. Where are all the slippers????? Its cold out. ...< /text>

Inexpensive shopping?  I compared the online prices with in-store items & concluded that you will be paying about 17% more in the store (or saving 17% by shopping at Walmart.com & having it delivered!)< /review>

Reasonable prices and selection. However, there was no canned dog food.
As always, could use more checkers, but a compliment to the service manager, since he kept helping those of us in line, even though he had a closed sign on the conveyer belt. THANK YOU!</text>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Everything is so empty the past few times I have gone here. Super empty shelves all over, not many options for any item. And so much stuff is locked up. I understand they have a theft problem but they also have a massive loitering problem. There are always lots of homeless and sketchy people in the parking lot. Maybe if they controlled that better the theft would go down some. It's just irritating to have to constantly push a button and wait or find an associate to get something out of the lock case. If u need spray paint, sand paper, socks, and a phone charger all in the same shopping trip, thats waiting at 4 different cases in different areas of the store. And there's much much more locked up. Half the time I say screw it. And then they need to bring the item to the front but only register 8 so if all lines are short or self checkout is open and register 8 is super long you have to stand in that line for your socks they unlocked. I also think customer service closes to early considering they always have a long line there and once its time to close they won't help who ever is left standing in line. And from my experience, the 3 times Iv gone to customer service the ladies working back there are super slow and chatty.<//Review>< Pics>

This Walmart had more empty shelves than I've ever seen at a Walmart. Very little selection compared to a SuperCenter. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the mall entrance is nice!<//Text>

It was ok but really low on stock in several areas. I've seen better Walmart's. The space they have doesn't quite fit with the service they should be giving.< /Text>

Walmart is one of the biggest companies in the world, therefore; they should be smart enought o have two employees work the customer service desk on the first. I've been in line for over an hour now< /Text>

<review>This is the 1 walmart in the whole northern California. So if you have to happen to need walmart and you're in this area. Brace yourself, there are very few places like walmart in Eureka, CA. Just don't leave anything unattended in your car that you don't want stolen and even then, just probably go up to Oregon itd be better.</review>< GmapID>

<Review>Sorry excuse for a store. The area needs a super walmart not this place. Due to the landslides in my area I "shopped" there yesterday. Was disgusted as I've been with every visit. Will not patronize this location again. I've shopped Wal Mart since the mid 1980's.</Review><response>None<//response><user_id>116391676908516922042< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Walmart is cool, often incredibly crowded, like chock full of??? All sorts, sporting all sorts of attire.
the staff is so very friendly and helpful, overworked and underpaid.
EDIT IN REGARDS TO THE "CUSTOMER SERVICE" AREA!  I can't imagine the stresses of you alls days at your work, but I feel that was uncalled for. The half pint behind the counter completely  ignores me, the seemingly friendly individual chatting up the customer ahead of me then wants to be impatient with me. The whole 2 seconds it would take to open the prepared screen shot, and suddenly ms impatient wants to set me in the corner until I'm better prepared. I feel for you both as to whatever you must endure throughout your day... but I'm not that guy. I certainly wouldn't treat you or your big boy pants coworker that way. But if thats how it has to be? Very well then, i can take my business elsewhere. Monday. May 17, 2021. 2:10 pm. I can only hope that it is you guys Friday. That ways after some rest and recharge you can handle things like assisting customers in a polite or at least professional fashion.</Text>

Prices are good.  Good place for camping  equipment, electronics, casual clothing, sterling silver jewelry. They have a well stocked pharmacy and makeup and accessory section.  Also, auto suppliers are much cheaper here than O'Reilys or Auto Zone.  Food is not any cheaper than Winco. Cigs are reasonably priced.  Open till midnight.<//Text>

This Walmart has the worst selection of women's clothing I have ever seen in any store hands down. The clothes are either for very obese people or extremely skinny people. And the selection is obviously chosen by somebody who has no idea what fashion or comfortable clothing is. I usually like clothing from Walmart in other cities but I can never find even one shirt or pair of pants in this Walmart that I like. Whoever their buyer is for products and needs to be fired. Other than that is just a lot smaller than most Walmarts and the location is not very great as it's hidden behind a mall.<//text>

Very clean and well stocked considering that we are in a GLOBAL Pandemic.  Looks like they are working as fast as they can. At the same time keeping to the guidelines recommended by the CDC and Our Governor.< /Review>

Makes you go into a Mall and then when you get to Wal-Mart door it tells you the entrance is at the back of the Mall so you have to go all the way back out of the mall again and get in your car and back behind the Mall. ???<//review>

Our Walmart in Eureka, CA is one of Walmart's Finer stores.
The customer service is always there to he there to help you find what you are looking for. The store is very clean and we'll organized. Although it doesn't have a fresh food department it does carry frozen and dry goods at some great prices. The only con I have is returning a item can be very painful taking more than an hour at times standing in a line where people are cashing checks, sending money etc. The pharmacy is the best in town with a very knowledgeable staff and quick refills. If we didn't have Walmart our mall would be empty!<//Text>

I really like are Walmart Store on the coast. It's close enough I can usually get a ride with someone.  The prices are nice just like most of the employees. If they don't have it they know where to get it.<//Text>

It was terrible they only had 2 cashiers working 4 or more people in every line. No respect for social distancing. Cashiers were rude. Put chemicals in bag with my food.< /text>

Big sign at the large entrance to the mall stating, "Walmart", yet upon entering, one discovers that it is merely the entrance to the mall and that there is no way to enter Walmart from inside the mall as those doors (not even close to the mall entrance) are locked... So you have to go back outside, get in your car, drive ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BUILDING to the back, party again, and then you can enter Walmart.

Even a sign informing shoes of this would have been nice!< /text>

It does appear that they are beginning to carry produce.
🤔
However, throughout the store there are vacant hooks and shelves. Many items remaining unstocked. 😕
Still, my go-to place for many items where Walmart's prices are still unbeatable.👍</text>

I have never been to a Walmart where: 1. They do not sell fruits and vegetables- I was told they don't have room. 2. Self checkout is limited to 20 items. 3. You can not purchase alcohol thru the self checkout - even though there is a employee standing there. 4. They have no deli.

Instead of making one stop we had to make two.  We will be by passing this Walmart in the future.<//text>

This store is being maintained at a bare minimum. It is in very poor shape and the things you are used to getting, you will not find. Walmart has other plans for the property but they will have to take ownership before spending a dime.</Text>

I had ordered this vanilla card for the 5th or so and took 53 bucks every time until they drained all my credit. Then wouldn't tell me what happened to the money. I don't have it in my account so I can say that I have to wait for 5 to 7 days to get it back. Meanwhile I'm out of money. Thanks for caring about your customer care  and making money off my credit money for them that have it all..<//Review></record>

Aaron from self check out is extremely rude. He rudely took items from my cart and said that my husband couldn't make a separate purchase since we both used the same cart to walk up to the check out stand. Despite there being absolutely no posted sign about buying multiple items at self check out, Aaron made a scene about us not being able to purchase our items. Completely unprofessional.</text>

<Review>They need air conditioning, because it's always warm and humid in there. I go there a lot and I'm tried of sweating there. They also need to add more places to sit, so people can rest while shopping. They also need more in store wheel charts for people that can't push a regular chart. They also need to be more stock up on stuff because lately, I've been seeing a lot of empty shelves.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>4<//Rating><userid>111322605355623543831< /userid><Name>Aleia Torres<//Name>< response>

<text>The line was so long and as usual only one checklane was open. I asked a manager if they could get more people to the front and he told me he was working on it. Twenty minutes later my line had not moved so I left my cart there with all the things I wanted to purchase. I went somewhere else and got everything I needed. Going to Walmart was a wasted stop!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

They asked people to wear masks, but don't enforce it. Personally, I wish they did.  The clerk in electronics was very helpful.</review>

Let's just say that Walmart here is a sad experience that is generally unpleasant.  Even with slightly lower prices, if I had to pick between a highly commercialized store I'd go to Target instead.</Review>

You can blame covid-19 but why are shelves still barron of product? Lame excuse or poor service?
American made products should be lining those empty shelves. We need to bolster ourselves, not foreign imports.<//text>

I hate Walmart. I wouldn't shop here under normal circumstances.  Everyone is hurting due to the pandemic, so we have to be frugal in a way that is disappointing. The least Walmart could do is sell ONLY Made In America products!! Shame on you Walmart! I will do my best never to shop there, again</text>

If you have a return, expect about a 35 minute wait time, they really need to have more than one associate working the customer service desk.< /Text>

Avoid the money center unless u have all day to waste... They usually only have one person working and all the other workers are just hanging out talking to each other. The worker Pam was awesome and very quick when I finally made it to the front of the line.</Text>

Never cashiers or any other department help available nearly everytime I shop. And when I've had to ask other employees to call someone to help in one of these departments they've treated me like an inconvenience/burden/issue and complained about servicing me,while rushing me so bad that I gave up on purchasing/asking for more help from them altogether</Review>

This Walmart store in Eureka was disgusting.  I won't go there again.  The store wasn't clean, bare shelves, products  on the floor.  The customer service, there wasn't any.< /text>

I have always been satisfied with this location. My only complaint is that they need to stop cheaping out and open more registers!!!! They funnel everyone through self checkout or register 8 where they sell liquor and cigarettes while registers 1-7 stay closed, it's very inconvenient. Their pharmacy is awesome though, great staff who should get 5 stars!!!!< /text>

They need more cashiers to be working. There shouldn't be just 2 working or maybe there might just be one open at times. Differently need cashiers to be working.<//text>

<review>Fun place to go if you've got nothing to do on a Saturday night. It's like a zoo with no zookeepers. If you station yourself in the freezer section for a little while, you'll see all sorts come and go. The employees look haunted, but I understand - I've seen the bathrooms. Free entertainment for hours.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Typically we love shopping at Wal-Mart...just not the Eureka Wal-Mart. What should have been a fun outting for all (considering that we have all been couped up together for a long time period.) Instead, became more like a nightmare. While we were shopping we noticed that there were employees sneaking around aisles to spy on customers. While we thought this was strange we figured that who knows maybe those customers were up to something suspicious... That was until it happened to us. We weren't doing anything other than our normal routine shopping. It completely infuriated my husband who kept demanding to know the reason for such behavior. Obviously no answer was forthcoming. Eventually we left everything that we were going to buy in our basket and left. How completely horrible! Neither if us has a history of theiving nor have either if us EVER stolen ANYTHING in our ENTIRE LIVES! So to be treated like a common theif was something I have never had to experience nor do I EVER want to experience again! We just wanted to enjoy our day out and instead got criminalized for no reason. To this day I still cannot fathom why they would EVER treat their customers with such disrespect. Then again I have never been a Wal-Mart employee either. So buyer beware! Wal-Mart good! Eureka Wal-Mart terrible!< /review><date>1587374576286<//date><Rating>2</Rating>< name>

Absolute worst Walmart I've ever seen or been in. Desperately needs updating, shelves half empty, dirty.  They also do not have any fresh food, only frozen.  It is in a failed mall that is in the same terrible condition.< /review>

People were nice and the store was clean.  Unfortunately, this WM does not have fresh meat or produce.  One thing we found odd was some product placements.  For example, a couple shelves of canned corn are between shelves of cereal.< /review>

I love Walmart expect this one that has everything under lock and key because of the tweekers so you have to get rung up in each department .. so I find myself going to target so I don't have to swipe my card 3 times before I leave the store< /text>

If you like buying cheap products or products made in China that are also cheap or you want to support the Chinese economy then Walmart is the place you want to be.

Now to be fair they do have American made products in the store and from other countries, might have to search for it but they're there. And I cannot help the fact that my favorite French vanilla creamer is there in large quantities and is the cheapest in town.

Yes, I know people that work there so this is not about the people who work there. Still they're understaffed and it is difficult to find someone who can help you and if you do find someone who can help you it's most likely a trainee. For the staff please don't take this personally it's not about you the person, it is about management though. And there should be more floor managers out on the floor. The regular floor employees are always pulling double and triple duty to take care of everybody. For as poorly as this place maybe organized and run it is still 10 times better than some of the stores I have found back in the South near their main headquarters. Even after all the criticism I might have about shopping at Walmart you will find me in there from time to time looking for that cheap product. I would say good luck to you Walmart but from your profit rating I would say that you're already having the best luck in the world. Now if we can only get a Best Buy Store in Eureka. I have a local electronic scratch that I can't fix online. Maybe we can interest Best Buy with recent departure of Kmart store at the south end town. Or maybe at the soon to be old Sears store. I hear things aren't going well for them either.< /text>

<Text>It was awful!  The big guy in customer service was not helpful, rude, and had a bad attitude. I'd never go back again and would way rather go to Target. The customer service is a hundred time better there. I'd suggest emphasizing being helpful and courteous to your employees.< /Text><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x54d400063ed0d759:0x811839d88968faf8</gmapID>< Rating>

<text>I am not a fan of this particular Walmart.  It is seedy feeling and everything is locked up, so it can be a hassle to buy something ordinary like deodorant.  The checkout line is slow and long.  The store feels dirty in areas.  It makes the already cheap merchandise seem even crappier.< /text>< pictures>

Wide selection of items for a small location. About half the employees have bad attitudes or just don't care at work. We've heard one girl use the F word several times. We shop there because you can't beat the prices on most things.< /text>

Clerk supervisor that is short tiny Latina has superb customer service as well as the young man who works electronics. Whoever does the merchandise ordering needs help with clothing departments, visit yuba City Walmart for better ideas. This Walmart needs help in this area.</Review>

<rate>3</rate><review>This location has the bare essentials, so if that is what you need, this store is great. We are used to super Walmarts and had some specific needs for this visit, but this Walmart just didn't have those items. Not too big a problem, since other specialty stores in the area had what we needed, just required more than the one stop to find what we needed. 3 star rating is due to the store not having everything we needed/wanted (specifically health and  body section and food section).

Store was clean and the lady at the checkout was very nice.<//review>< pictures>

Shopping on a budget and needs for everything from grooming, food, pharmaceutical and pet supplies are all available, in addition to the service desk providing check cashing, money orders and money transfer, the last being possible with the online app and a quick trip through the express lane for ease. The staff is knowledgeable and ALWAYS helpful, management seems to keep the machine running no matter how crazy it gets.I can simply say, for the diminutive value of the dollar, Wal-Mart is the prime reason why my shopping dollar goes far.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><date>1537737296256<//date><userid>107117268568784792326<//userid><user_name>Sean Avery<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

My wife really enjoys shopping here for the prices. I really like the techy side of things, like using the app to pay. I had a very good experience with using the mobile return function. We dreaded returns in the past because the CS lines were always very long but no one uses the mobile return and I was done quickly. In addition their online order pickup has really sped up!<//Review>

<Text>One of the worst Walmart stores I've been to. Everything is locked up so you have to wait for someone to get it for you then you have to wait in long lines because only one cashier. Plan to waste a bunch of time here that you shouldn't have to waste.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This Walmart can be a  s p o o k y  place they have folks posted at the doors to check receipts as you leave because theft is so common, the parking lot is less than safe and the store itself has some interesting clientele. I try to avoid it to be honest, but it does have pretty affordable prices for day to day essentials.</review>

<Review>No fresh produce, no deli and no bakery.  Very disappointed in what they did stock.  No variety of what they did have.  Wow. Worst Walmart I've ever been in and we go to all of them because we are full time RV'er.  However that being said the employees were very helpful very pleasant and nice.  Plus had to pay $.10 for each sack.   Only in California.  Lol< /Review><time>1557948882130</time>< user>

I am not a fan of this particular Walmart.  It is seedy feeling and everything is locked up, so it can be a hassle to buy something ordinary like deodorant.  The checkout line is slow and long.  The store feels dirty in areas.  It makes the already cheap merchandise seem even crappier.< /review>

This Walmart may be a little smaller than the average one but it gets the job done for the very most part! It's got a little bit of everything---with the exception of fresh produce and fresh meat/chicken/fish. For those you will need to go to Safeway (in Eureka). Or Ray's(to the South or north of Eureka).  Or to health food store or the "Canned Food Store". But really for most anything else-- this Walmart can be your friend. Friendly,helpful staff/crew and the best manager of any store I can remember ever meeting and dealing with. (James)  Good job, Walmart !<//text>

Third smallest Walmart in the USA. Ridiculously small produce section, but grocery and frozen aisles are sort of OK, they take up right side of store. You could do all of your grocery shopping here if you're not picky about certain brands missing. Clothes in the middle, pet food & cosmetics on the right, electronics and auto in the back. They managed to fit a mini version of every normal Walmart section into a tiny space, and didn't do a bad job at it. Definitely not worse than having no Walmart at all. Also recently installed self-checkouts, which is a plus!<//Text>

It's walmart what more can you say. Never have everything on a shopping list. I only go there because the travel time to go to more than one store is a waste. They are out of there own brand even at 10 am. Two slots for there cola soda and 10 slots ea for coke and Pepsi.</text>

Prepare to be treated like a criminal, scanners at every entrance. You cant bring in outside bags. In the cosmetic department you are in a secure section and have to pay for those items in that section before being allowed to shop in there rest of the store.<//text>

<Text>Easy returns, inexpensive items,  next time i'll shop online though due to the people that go there. Normally i notice they are either people with addiction issues, kids from the mall or a mixture of both. I see why there's pictures on google images under "walmart people" and why it feels so cringey. The workers have a cheery attitude but people who normally go in look to be under high levels of stress, just high or overloaded with children i'm noticing..i would suggest maybe our local walmart training their staff to not only have a friendly and professional attitude but maybe an event to be more involved in the community. i have observed poor attitude or inability to show empathy from both worker and customer alike but i think having the employees make a public event for families would be not only an excellent business opportunity but a great way to get happy customers and have happy workers. Just an idea from a local customer here who has both worked and been a customer. And, just one more thought, being that its summer and weather is changing around the world, keeping everyone cool, i think, should be a priority and a solution could be more air conditioning for workers and in the store, cooler filtered water at store drinking fountains for worker and customers. Maybe an hourly walk around the building with security guards (i would say 2 at a time due to the amount of people that are just hanging outside doing illegal activities and can be bothersome or rude to customers) offer a drink (of water) and ask them to go??? I only write a long review because these are the constant issues that make me not want to come back in my own community and these, to me, would make me want to come back. Honestly, our community also has a great college,both at CR and HSU that teach excellent skills to students who could certify as child care specialists and i think it would depreciate stress and increase shopping if walmart offered or funded proper child care for customers?? Just something that i believe many people would desire while getting household needed items. :)< /Text>< name>

Its got what I need and there is a person everywhere you turn. But never enough cashiers. All the service/associates I saw at least twice could never be found at the register when it was time for me to leave. The single cashier and the door person offered to go get aid for me since I hobbled to every corner in pain actually purchasing.<//text>

It's actually the second smallest Walmart in America,lol. The smallest one is in Ukiah, CA. Funny. I found it to be like a sample Walmart. It has everything a big Walmart has, just less of it, except for good prices and friendly helpful staff. Great for internet pickup.< /text>

Prepare to be treated like a criminal, scanners at every entrance. You cant bring in outside bags. In the cosmetic department you are in a secure section and have to pay for those items in that section before being allowed to shop in there rest of the store.</review>

This Walmart has NEW management!  NEW associates!  And NEW attitudes!

With the recent ouster of old management, some of which are facing criminal charges, this Walmart is undergoing much needed improvements.  New management has cleared out problem employees, hired 50+ new associates, and improved the overall customer experience.  New delivery schedules, new inventory procedures, and added employees mean shelves are better stocked, the store is cleaner, and customer service is improved.

Customers still need to consider that this Walmart is next to Eureka's largest homeless population camp behind the Bayshore Mall, and that some new store policies have been implemented to deter shoplifting, panhandling, and loitering by these local vagrants.  Overall, the store is 100% better than it was 3 months ago!

This Walmart, while small, does have a new produce section, offering a full array of fresh produce.  Due to store size, not all items that larger Walmarts carry, can possibly fit on their limited shelves, but they do have free Site to Store available online, so you can still get every item Walmart offers.

Go in and see the improvements!  While you are there, let the associates, and management, know that you notice the changes, make suggestions for improvements, and thank them for being there.  The employees are working hard to make this Walmart better for all customers and for themselves, let them know you appreciate their efforts!<//text>

Crescent city Wal-Mart is terrible the manager named Shelley is very rude to us every time we go there..always accuses us of stealing even though we would never steal .  they're always out of everything . there are a few nice workers an older lady with blond hair as the greeter shes always so sweet to us she makes the Wal-Mart worth the visit ..<//review>

You guys have the most shittiest customer service I've ever experienced. I waiting an hour in your customer service center two different times on the same day and they both gave me bullshit excuses on why I couldn't recieve my money from my family . There was only one person working who didn't care and would just take her time even though there was 20 people in line but she didn't care . Your customer service sucks!!!<//Text>

The ONLY Walmart in Humboldt County. Its in a very odd location, being part of the Bayshore Mall. Super small compared to any other Walmart I have ever seen. Prices are higher for most items here compared to WinCo 2 blocks away. Not enough parking. Getting in and out of the mall parking lot is a pain. NOT open 24/7. Not a Super Walmart. Puny selection compared to most other Walmarts. No appliances, bikes, automotive, bakery, take out food, small selection of electronics. Employees not really trained for their specific sections. Dont expect anyone in sporting goods to know anything about sporting goods or anyone in electronics to know how to set up a prepaid phone. If you need people who know what they are doing try Target instead.<//Text>

<Review>Smaller Wal-Mart; no live fish. Very small TV/electronics section. Conveniently connected to the back of the Bayshore Mall. Can't take the shopping carts into the mall though. Their propane tank system sucks. They've sold us old, expired tanks before; and they are horrible at refilling them. Heard many locals complain about them before, and after living here for a few years my partner and I agree with their complaints about the propane system specifically at this Wal-Mart. Low prices on cheap stuff tho.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This Walmart has NEW management!  NEW associates!  And NEW attitudes!

With the recent ouster of old management, some of which are facing criminal charges, this Walmart is undergoing much needed improvements.  New management has cleared out problem employees, hired 50+ new associates, and improved the overall customer experience.  New delivery schedules, new inventory procedures, and added employees mean shelves are better stocked, the store is cleaner, and customer service is improved.

Customers still need to consider that this Walmart is next to Eureka's largest homeless population camp behind the Bayshore Mall, and that some new store policies have been implemented to deter shoplifting, panhandling, and loitering by these local vagrants.  Overall, the store is 100% better than it was 3 months ago!

This Walmart, while small, does have a new produce section, offering a full array of fresh produce.  Due to store size, not all items that larger Walmarts carry, can possibly fit on their limited shelves, but they do have free Site to Store available online, so you can still get every item Walmart offers.

Go in and see the improvements!  While you are there, let the associates, and management, know that you notice the changes, make suggestions for improvements, and thank them for being there.  The employees are working hard to make this Walmart better for all customers and for themselves, let them know you appreciate their efforts!<//Text>

It's unfortunate that they have to keep the shampoo, makeup, and some of the other beauty and health items under guard. It makes shopping for these items difficult and awkward, because the area they're in is very cramped and confusingly organized. It's so bad that I usually buy shampoo when I visit family -- 6 hours away -- rather than brave that cramped little corner of the store. You have to purchase those items before you leave the area.
They also are chronically understocked in other areas of the store, and the layout is confusing.
The employees have always been friendly and as helpful as possible, and it really isn't their fault that shoplifting necessitated the shampoo guard, or that the pot growers buy all of their storage tubs around harvest season, or that the delivery trucks come less frequently here than to stores in the rest of CA. I give the employees 5 stars for carrying on.</Review>

Horrible experience overall. I was picking up money from the Wal Mart to Wal Mart momey transfer center. Just a heads up to the people leaving a domestic violence situation Wal Mart does not care. When someone is in transition there is no way to pick up money. Terrible business practices in my opinion.< /Review>

Would be better if the guy who is supposed to be watching self checkout didn't run off after shoplifters every minute for 10 minutes at a time then stop you at the door like a criminal and spend 5 minutes going through every one of your bags and receipt. The store is very disorganized and dirty feeling. Was even a guy yelling down the aisles about how walmart is enslaving children to work in a cult. Fun times.</Review>

Not impressed with the staff at all. They treat customers deplorably and act offended when called upon to actually do their given jobs. Always there is somebody with an attitude as a checker complaining about not getting paid enough to do their job. The store is actually not too bad for a small town Walmart in merchandise however leaves a lot to be desired due to the absolute lack of professionalism or courteousness in their staff as well they don't know anything about their own store. Every time I do business there I'm kicking myself in the butt for it because there's nothing worth going there for any more when you get treated so poorly<//text>

I guess it could be worse but barely. All the common things a re gone like white ts or black shoes etc. Dollar flash lights and sleeping bags are locked up because of all the homeless and thievery. The staff will accost you even if you slightly resemble a homeless person ie day after camping hair day etc. Door guy is a nazi about my service dog although ive told him 60 times hes got no right to harass anyone over it. Tiny. Half empty. Staff is never anywhere to be found</Review>

I would give this place -100 stars if I could. The "customer" service is atrocious. They will have one person at the register for a line of over 20 people!!! This is not Wall Mart it's a joke.< /Text>

I was in the stall trying to use it and some idiot kept cussing and then he started beating on the door. Even had the nerve to look over the stall door.(Where I hope He got an eye full) I will avoid this dump as much as possible.< /review>

Tweakers and meth heads milling about, homeless people in parking lot, one guy buying beer at 1030am with his pants showing his entire backside. Socks were locked up behind a glass case. Yes, I said socks. And it took 15 mins for me to locate an employee to unlock it. And her hands were full of restock merchandise. I realize Walmart does not care about the clientele as long as the money flows, but damn this was bad. Stay away.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I said,"I saw 40 employees back there someone 'could' help" and she replied, "that's too many"
I admit I was exaggerating but I literally saw 15 w/o looking and 2 customers besides myself. Fire her or I'll be in to complain personally.  Steve at the door said that he would have someone talk to her., but I dont believe him.
Next a handicapped customer behind me made a mistake and needed an additional item. Again she refused to help. I said dont ash her she went help you." She acknowledged me and replied,"nope"</Text>< pictures>

Worst Walmart I have been to in any state. Everything is locked up because of theft problems and there only ever seems to be one guy with a key to unlock stuff. Takes forever. Always out if dairy products. I avoid going here< /Review>

I was in the stall trying to use it and some idiot kept cussing and then he started beating on the door. Even had the nerve to look over the stall door.(Where I hope He got an eye full) I will avoid this dump as much as possible.<//review>

<Review>I think I’m being generous here. It is honestly a scary experience with kiddos at your side. Tweakers and meth heads milling about, homeless people in parking lot, one guy buying beer at 1030am with his pants showing his entire backside. Socks were locked up behind a glass case. Yes, I said socks. And it took 15 mins for me to locate an employee to unlock it. And her hands were full of restock merchandise. I realize Walmart does not care about the clientele as long as the money flows, but damn this was bad. Stay away.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Self check out is a joke! The people who use it don't know how. It takes way longer than before. People don't know jack about what they are selling but, that's the price you pay for low wage jobs. Always has long lines.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I would give them a ZERO if i could. Believe me when I say this, GO TO TARGET. I absolutely hate Walmart. WORST COSTUMER SERVICE IN MY LIFE. First off, this walmart has lost my packages 10 times. They refused to refund me for my store pick up items that they lost. THEY LOST IT AND WOULDN'T REFUND ME. IT WAS NOT SHIPPED TO MY HOUSE, IT WAS FOR STORE PICKUP. I WAITED 2 HOURS JUST TO HAVE THEM SAY, THEY LOST IT. SECOND, THEY HAVE 50 WORKERS BUT ONLY 2 CASHIER OPEN. 2 CASHIER OPEN!!!!!!! ALL THE EMPLOYEES ARE JUST TALKING AND LAUGHING. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I HATE WALMART! THIRD, EVEN WHEN THEY HEARD ME SAY OUT LOUD " I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE IT BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND IT." THEY JUST STARE AND WALK AWAY. WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER, AND THIS HAPPENS A LOT!<//Text>< pictures>

Standard Wal Mart with all the typical things you imagine when you think of wal mart with the added detriment of the Devil's Playground 100 ft away from your car.  If you don't know what that is, it's a famous place where all the homeless gather like a swarm and build a little shanty town every night.  Lots of stabbings and drugs there, documentaries have been made of that location.</text>

<Gmap_id>0x54d400063ed0d759:0x811839d88968faf8</Gmap_id><review>I purchased a straight talk wireless phone. Quickly I was prompted by over three employees asking about my day and if I needed help. Rarely do I find a walmart where the customer service is this welcoming. Complements to the hiring staff. I only gave 4 starts out of a bias for some of walmarts company practices in foreign countries.</review>< username>

this is your typical Walmart. But there's a lot of druggies that come in from the Marsh in the back and it makes it a little sketchy. Make sure you lock your car doors when you go shopping.<//text>

Regii, calling out white people in an attempt to  claim racial profiling is a special kind of ignorance. Get a life and study slavery and racism and learn a few things. We can all quote slavery propaganda, but you have a choice to step up and become more than just another victim. Get over yourself.<//text>

This is the smallest, most disorganized Walmart I have ever been in. The people who work their don't seem to care about anything in the store..includes security too!. The place is always a mess, but then again most Walmarts are a MESS! I"ve given the store a  shopping chance several times, but  it's always the same.....a MESS. The only point of this store is that Walmart got it foot into the Eureka market, and that's all.< /Text>

Really disappointed. A few times now I've not received all my item I'm purchased. Tonight I call, and inform them that I once again didn't have all items I purchased. The lady on the phone could careless, and put me on hold to speak with a manager that never picked up the call for 10 minutes. I will take my business somewhere else.<//Text>

Worst customer service!  You have to walk all over the store to get help.  What's the use of all the registers and only 1 or 2 are open.  Employees avoid eye contact with you because they don't want to deal with you.  Rediculous!</Review>

I usually stay away from that side of town because it's just gross. So I can't really blame the store for being what it is...Eureka in general just has nasty people. You get what you pay for and when I go in I'm looking for cheap crap.<//text>

<text>Walmart is Walmart. Some employees are friendly, some not so much. Since this is a smaller Walmart, many things in their sales ads are not stocked in.this store and you have to order.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Horrible store, even worse employees.

Called to ask if they had a particular brand of hair dye, the lady "checked" and told me that they did have it in stock. We made the 30 minute drive up there right away, and guess what? They had just plain lied. It obviously hadn't been stocked since we had checked two weeks prior. They have now wasted a couple hours of our time and a couple gallons of our gas. If you have any other option, do not shop at this Walmart. Not to mention, it's dirty and the employees are unprofessional at best.<//Review>< Response>

I usually stay away from that side of town because it's just gross. So I can't really blame the store for being what it is...Eureka in general just has nasty people. You get what you pay for and when I go in I'm looking for cheap crap.<//Review>

< review>
The staff were very friendly, each time I visited this store. On one visit, the customer's in front of me were quite unreasonable. When it came my turn to check out, the clerk could not have been nicer.  Very professional.</review>

<review>They racially profiled me.
The greeter at the front wouldn't allow me into their store with my bag. I saw a number older white women pass me by with their purses, but she stopped me. It might only be one person who works there, but I shouldn't have to feel racially profiled when I walk into a Wal-Mart.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x54d400063ed0d759:0x811839d88968faf8</GmapID></record>

<Review>the eureka walmart is a disappointment--very small & not a good range of products-they are located in a 1/2 empty mall and with not too much expense--put in a supercenter which is what the town needs--people still drive the 90 miles north to Crescent City to shop the big store there--the market is here but I think they are cheap & lazy on the planning end--oh well---< /Review>< UserId.>
