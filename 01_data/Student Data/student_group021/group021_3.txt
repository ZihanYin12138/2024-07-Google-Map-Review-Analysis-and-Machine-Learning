Perfect, just what the doctor ordered! The receptionist assistance and hygienist and dentist were all terrific and very caring. The office and treatment rooms were immaculate. But please don’t all crowd in there! I like it just the way it is, serene<//Text>

I have been a client here for over 17 years and enjoy my experience with John the hygienist and  his thoughtful approach to caring for our teeth, of course we also appreciate and love Dr. Nazanin Morshedi as well, very professional and personable and feel well taken care of. Thank you!!

Again such a wonderful experience and always feel so well cared for.< /Text>

<review>I have been going to this dentist for 15+ years and they have always been so friendly and professional. When I first came to the SF Bay Area, I tried lots of other dentists that I really didn’t like. I am so glad to have found them. My wife goes there too. We’ve moved a few times but we have kept our dentist.<//review><rating>5<//rating><name>Scott Caputo<//name><date>1564763363798</date><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

Dr Morshedi and her office staff (John and Catherine) are wonderful! I can not recommend them highly enough! They are caring, thorough, extremely responsive, do excellent dental work, and basically take care of all my needs and my family’s needs. We’ve used them for years and hope to do so for the foreseeable future!<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Morshedi, John, & Catherine all do a great job of making everyone feel welcome while also giving some of the best dental care I've ever received.
Catherine is always a step ahead of any insurance issues and makes every phone call or step in the door feel like you're interacting with family. With Catherine doing as much work on the paperwork side in advance and the efficient working relationship between Dr. Morshedi & John, I'm often in-and-out in 30 minutes for a cleaning.
Make no mistake, though, I've never felt rushed. After a warm welcome from Catherine, she or John start the visit off with a warm and scented neck pillow. The little niceties keep coming through the procedure itself with glasses to help block the bright light of the overhead lamp.
If they have to do any drilling, they offer a radio and headphones to help block that shrilling noise. I found even more comfort in realizing how up to date Dr. Morshedi stays on dental technologies. It sucks to have to get a filling re-done, but, dang it, it was so cool to see her take a 3D image of my mouth and then walk right down the hall to get my new filling off her printer.
Finally, whether it is a standard cleaning or another procedure, the cherry, er, maybe lavender on top, is a fresh lavender-scented towel to wipe off your face. After a quick stop with Catherine to schedule your next appointment, you're out the door feeling calmer than when you stepped through it.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We have been with Dr Morshedi for more than 10 years now. She is always wants
to “make the right decision to protect your teeth 🦷”  not aggressive, unless needed.
And if needed she has a great network for orthodontist and specialists.<//text>

She catches problems early and any follow up care is usually available within a week or two. She goes to great lengths to provide excellent care while minimizing any discomfort. She and her staff of John and Catherine are all affable yet professional and always welcoming. Even without insurance the out of pocket cost for preventative care is worth it in my opinion.< /text><date>1558052937878</date><user>110133623010367356407<//user><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rating>

The team here is amazing. Very kind, professional, and patient.
I developed a fear of the dentist after a bad experience getting my wisdom teeth taken out when I was 20. Their calm environment and mannerisms really helped ease my anxiety.
I have moderate to severe TMJD and was able to get it treated here. They were extremely helpful with that entire process.<//Text>

When you choose an item to purchase from the racks, they actually give you a fresh one from the back. Nothing picked over or previously worn<//review>

<Text>Sales Girl was more than helpful,  and wasn't the pushy kind.  She sold my son on the chocolate,  he loves it.  Got him a hoody and a hat,  great quality,  decent prices.

<review>The atmosphere in the place is more like a hangout, chill spot, the staff makes you fell welcomed, willing to help you make that style, even helped me create a look but if you know what you want and got your size they hook you right up.  Oh Yeah Thea got sizes, mass supply of sweatclothes or get some help in store to place an order good quality gear.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>I wish I could rate this place better. The staff was all friendly and helpful except for Marshawn. We flew from out of town and were excited to check out the store... Mostly everything was way to big and had very little selection.
Marshawn walked around the store grunting and glaring at everyone and picking up trash spread all over the place. We spent quite a bit of money and when we asked for an autograph Marshawn snarled and said one minute; then proceeded to walk around and ignore the guy asking for the autograph. Everyone in the town talks poorly about him although the media says he does a lot for the community. Even the airport staff says when he’s off camera he’s a jerk even to kids.
Go to raider image and spend money there. It’s clear that they actually care you are in their store.< /review><user_name>Dan Bennett</user_name><GmapID>0x808f80b6fd0bc9e7:0xa3098fd48907e5bd</GmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

<Text>Love this store, staff is exceptionally helpful ! I brought some beastmode candy bars back to Alabama for my boys,  originally from the bay, Everytime I walk in my 15 year olds bedroom I see the Tshirts and candy bars on display. I get a piece of home, thank you Beastmode !!

<Text>I want to say this is French style American cuisine or American style French cuisine, I guess it depends on what you order. I highly recommend this place for flavor and quality of food and service. The team here was phenomenal from the reservation to the desert. The couple that runs Rêve Bistro is steeped in hospitality and fine dining experience, very well run and extremely affordable for what you get. You will be delighted with an evening here!< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The mushroom risotto was amazing, the ribeye was underwhelming and the iles flottantes deserts was out of this world.

Two disappointments was we sat inside and clearly the service team was not used to having guests indoors as they were very loud in the way they communicated with each other....and the biggest surprise was when the server took my wine ($700 retail) and decanted it out of sight...I've  never seen that happen before.

I hate to leave a 3 star as I really love what they do here, and while it's normally my happy place my last two experiences (yesterday and 4 days ago) left me a little disappointed.< /Review>

<Name>nia chanel<//Name><time>1595781572687</time><pictures>None<//pictures><text>Their entree dishes look great and the ambiance is very nice!

The reason for my low rating is solely based on the escargot.... I was really excited to find RÊVE Bistro because it was the only French restaurant in the East Bay that offered them (near my house at least).

The sauce was good!!!! However, the snail tasted a little off and upset my stomach slightly.

I'd still go back but next time I would try another dish.</text>< rating>

<Review>Wow! I can't say enough about this place. I went here on a Wednesday (Tuesday & Wednesday 50% off bottles of wine) and asked the waitress for suggestions on wine based on our food. She was SPOT ON. The food was so amazingly done that we wanted dessert but literally was too full and ordered it to take out.

Ever wanted to experience France or love French food? Please go out and patronize this business! Every dollar is worth it.< /Review>< pics>

Then, I had Creme of Mushroom Soup, split a Seasonal Green Salad, Cassoulet for my entree and finished with Lemon Meringue Tart. Soup was 4/5; salad 3/5; bean casserole 3/5; tart 5/5.  The Cassoulet  was a bit too thick. I like mine to be wetter.  My understanding of Cassoulet is that it is a bean casserole with duck, Andoule Sausage and a chunk of pork (salted or smoked).

For me, the best parts of the meal were the Pomme  Frites and the Lemon Meringue Tart. I find it kind strange that the best parts of a meal where the beginning and the end.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXdhO_cnQAzE0DOEqZhHi_TzB5xDs1o6rLSVW2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_xb5tVAKM5eTPhVD0D687MGfa3VvxQEv8Ss9E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgyhd5TZEi1JrY_V5L-A7vMYqV-TF9iTc3s5gQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1584254261708, 'text': "Hello James,\nI'm sorry the chef's cassoulet disappointed you.

Love it wonderful classic French food.
Don't worry about dining outside it's honestly a little nicer than inside
Pricy
Home food not like super fancy food. Still fancier than the average restaurant.

Discovered a delicious treasure last night.  After a long drive up from LA for my mother-in-law’s memorial we decided to venture out to take a mental break. Felt so welcomed and cared for by our waitress (I’m embarrassed I forgot her name) and the best French onion soup and escargot.  Perfectly seasoned.  Better than what we got in Paris. Thank you Reve Bistro!< /Text>

Went here for my Mom's birthday dinner. Very quaint, hole in the wall spot. The outside area was dressed up to look like a lit up street cafe you might find in Paris. Service was excellent. Highly, HIGHLY recommend the Beef Cheek dinner. So tender and the Chestnut Spaetzle that accompanies the Cheek was great as well. Wonderful selection of wines and for dessert, ask Sophie about the Calvados after dinner drink for dessert. Great digestive to settle all the delicious French food.< /Review>

It was our first time dinning here and Revé bistro did not disappoint. In fact, they went out of their way to make is feel welcomed, taken care of and satisfied. With all the health concerns surrounding our world and the economy affecting everyone in different ways,  we felt that local restaurants must be feeling the impact too so we ventured out for dinner. This gem of a French bistro served delicious onion soup, a generous  and mouth watering serving of muscles with garlic and cheese sauce, a beautifully prepared and tender steak and to top it off, dessert was crepe suzette...my oh my!...We will definitely return and bring our most discerning French food foodie friends with us next time. Absolutely!< /text>

Greeted and taken quickly to table. Waitress very helpful. Explained specials, answered questions. Drinks came quickly and food came HOT! There were 4 of us and there was Nothing Left on Any of our plates 😋  We all had dessert and again there was Nothing Left on Anyones plate 😋  The Only downside is the seating is close to everyone and it's a little noisy BUT we Will be returning. EXCELLENT FOOD, DRINKS AND STAFF 😁😁😁<//Text>

<user_id>102798794754057024413<//user_id><Text>Replacement for Le Chevalier - inherits the true French cuisine. Frogs legs, Snails are available, but also a simpler menu cooked with élan and flair.
Steak frites, etc.

This place still has the patio forth long summer evenings. The cost makes it a special treat, but it has desserts like Ille Flotante - so that all is forgiven. The wait staff (mostly) can speak French.

Great for an unusual romantic dinner or a proposal!< /Text>< Rate>

<review>We were told the restaurant had outdoor heaters and some type of enclosure, this was important as we were celebrating my mother's 91st birthday.  So right away it was clear they did not have the standard 7' tall outdoor heaters, they had a small floor unit.  Needless to say this did not put out adequate heat, to make matters worse it stopped working all together.

My mother likes a simple daiquiri: Rum, Lime Juice & Simple syrup on the rocks, however this seemed to stump the waitress and the bartender who had to each come out and say they couldn't make it because they didn't have any daiquiri mix or a blender.  The bartender finally brought a drink out that clearly did not look right, nor did it taste right!  Bartending 101 simple drink.

My mom then ordered the mussels which was touted heavily by the waitress for the delicious garlic cream sauce.  When the dish came, none of us at the table could really confirm there was any garlic in the sauce.
It was a terrible dining experience right from the beginning to the end.<//review>< username>

<text>Wonderful French bistro.  The only bistro I have  found in the Bay Area that regularly offers gougierres, which are THE thing to accompany wine. They are made fresh to order and come to the table hot. We order them every time. I have been here a few times now, and everything I have ordered has been cooked to perfection. This is our go-to place for impromptu mini-celebrations or have a craving for good, authentic French food. Probably the best French restaurant in the East Bay,  at least , in my opinion.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Definitely a “little Paris in the ‘hood!” If you’re looking for a special night out where you want to just imagine that you are back in the City of Light, go to Reve Bistro. Such a great atmosphere with fun seating inside, especially at the bar, and outside in the heated tent. The menu changes based on the season, but you can always rely in delicious steak frites and mussels. Plus, end your meal with the chocolate mousse< /Text></record>

Excellent new venue for Lafayette!

I remember when the space was occupied by Levy's bagels i think back in the early 90s

Food and service is pretty traditional bistro fare

Highly recommend the charcuterie platter and the veal sweet breads

Service was even and competent

Only complaint would be the tight quarters and the rocking table which they eventually fixed</text>

I went for the first time to Rêve Bistrot with a group of friends and we had a fabulous time there. From far, I had some of the best food in the Bay Area.
It’s a place to go with friends/family or for a romantic dinner ... and I think I’ll go back for a romantic dinner with my husband.<//review>

The traditional food such as Coq au Vin, Cassoulet and the like are the best. They also have specials each week based on seasonal availability. We just has fresh locally caught salmon. Yum.< /text></record>

Excellent French dining and very good service. The entire staff gave me a signed birthday card on my birthday dinner...and I'm a total nobody.< /Text>

<Review>Gougeres were light and tender but slightly salty that dimished the cheese flavor. Chilled tomato soup was too acidic and salty. Some lobster pieces were overcooked in the lobster salad and the Coq au Vin was tasteless. No red wine sauce soaked into the mushrooms abd were tasteless, especially how mushrooms absorb flavor, lardons were practically non-existent and the ones I found were tastless and the tagliatelle was coated in fat and were greasy. When I tried to explain the problems I had with the Coq au Vin, he insisted there was a red wine sauce in the dish when there was no evidence it ever existed on my plate. Had high hopes due to reviews on Check Please Bay area but was extremely disappointed.😞< /Review><response>None<//response><pics>None< /pics></record>

<review>We had a nice dinner there last night with the Soup is the Day, Chicken Taco Appetizer, Seasonal Salad Special and the Beyond Burger with Sweet Potato Fries! The beer and Ale menu continues to impress.
The service was much better than our last visit 3 weeks ago.
Looks like the Beyond Meat Burger, which could be substituted for any of the burgers on their menu is there to stay!
We found a decent food menu and excellent variety of ales, beers (30) and Kombucha (2).
The pickled beets, daikon and carrots were tasty!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPISWt3XQA8E__wgaRhF95WhTjurWLqiARKuACv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1XA8OElDrQbkbZoUv5BqMlREmRCydyMn1HqAZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDDQQoBDTKC-6kYZIzsfLAXz6Ps52wQXTZ-0vL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP0BYt6sCjtAsIjd-fxOPDuf5Q_8ijNtX-3431=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVQJA3YQkYLyD7Pm4SIbOX6_TdUpuOI_5uaw18=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4TbY1PxW51EZamkHxzMP3GtyEcKLfR_8vWL08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5nVz11PtUn5YsftXRY3m_EFxWqU0rh5f_F3Ih=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDTiqjWM7RDIkxh_FGDs1ZJbh_AGKkvmtHLsrw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbN_EcLYugZ8m3knM0cpL7tok858L4mW8cjcOc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwQk9cUDEb4ahSKxU_8Wu2Xx5DcnZXcqt687z5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEn554QjmQFdwAzNGpLMH1Re-InCUS63US0IUk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFhqzaa-TIs4bcueVJCxPSRp8QExXgg8VAmKzu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-zmTwPTZ1SpylSqt5V4DtNDzyWaF77PwrBfLs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNae1mBQDsFPbqNvG5jZlGhevdHmTYibph1cOrl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPu2RnSxKyhHSk3DwLQYxKkxABiEhI4b23rDWhY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxVIGj22JXKrfqBkztNhY2aHoeQCQDxgTkVP1r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0pRFtc4snXgSggiAfw05yRoBb2x8jVpDwINok=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><time>1579367481352<//time>< gmapID>

The lamb burger with added goat cheese was heavenly. Sweet potato fries and onion rings lifted things higher.</Review>

<review>The Sweet Potato fries were delicious! The Beyond Meat Burger is a welcome addition to the menu. Oktoberfest Bratwurst was tasty but on the small side.
It was busy Friday night and the service was pretty bad. Not the time to start training a new beer tender without people skills!< /review></record>

Very nice neighborhood taproom with an extensive beer list and a nice airy atmosphere.  There are many options for those who want a local taste, those in the know, and those who want to experiment a little.  The staff are very knowledgeable and attentive.  Food is generally good and pairs well with the beer.  I'm not a fan of tacos with fried shells, so I would give that a miss, but overall the portions and flavor are good.<//Review>

What a fantastic lineup of mostly-local beers! Their choices always seem to align with my tastes and this time I was  lucky enough to visit on Mini Barrel-aged Fest Day (or something like that). Truly yummy stuff.</Text>

Had the lamb burger a year ago and it was great. Ordered it tonight for delivery and it was terrible. And not because of the delivery: the bun was about 5 inches across, the patty... about 3 inches across and less than half an inch thick. V. dry though the flavor was good enough and a bit spicy. The bun was soggy and falling apart in the very middle while the outside was hard and dry as if it were stale (with absolutely no filling in the dry parts as the meat portion was so small). The "dressing" for the burger was a small splotch in the very center of the already tiny and sad patty. Dont know if it was an off night, but so disappointing I won't be trying their food again... especially at $15 for that sad sad lamb burger!<//Review>

Solid beer list w/ like 25 varying options.  Tons of local stuff and some more well known craft beers as well.  They also do flights!  The food was good that we tried, which was their house made potato chips and then also some fried chicken sliders.  Good stuff.  Service staff was cool, he was a little busy but he wasn't letting it get him down at all.  Good joint all around.< /review>

Great selection of beer, the have a solid happy hour (first 20 beers listed are a $1 off) and the food is really good.  The house pickles are excellent, salmon sliders are spict, but not too spicy, and the onion rings are excellent.</Review>

<Text>I love the many choices in beer available here.  The bartenders are very patient in answering my many questions and very knowledgeable about the beers. It is never too loud and it has a nice variety of seating options.<//Text><GmapID>0x808579302ae77e53:0xf84d033b469ffe70</GmapID>< Rate>

Great selection of micro & craft brews.  Burgers and menu in general very well done.  Don't miss bluegrass by High Country the 4th Wed. of each month if you're around.<//text>

<review>A friendly taproom with excellent bar food and a good selection of beers on tap. The only downside is that the food is a bit pricey, even for the good quality. But if you want a place in the Albany/Berkeley area to sit with a friend or two and chat over some beer and burgers (table service is available as well as bar seating), it's a fine choice.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The beer selection was great. Your able to order food from Grazzy Burger next door since they are connected. The mushroom Marsala burger was ok. Needed to add mayo. The shoe string fries had way to much spicy seasoning. Made them bitter. We never received our apptiezer and the entrees took a long time. The waiter rarely stopped by. The night was not very busy. Hard to order more beer when we rarely saw him. We often had to go the bar ourselves to get beer. There was a younger guy at the bar and he was the only quality worker there.< /Text>

Here I am on a chilly Thursday evening inside one of Albany's charming establishments: The Albany Taproom. Service was slow. I came in alone after work and the staff is more concerned with interacting with each other than interacting with guests. Their loss!

Onto the beer folks! 32 selections and I choose the barley wine from Napa Smith. 10 ounces, 10% carmel notes, toffee aftertaste, not too heavy on the palate. It's a winner. Atmosphere is nice. Place is busy. Plenary of seating. I chose to not order food.

Great selection of beer. Good service when they get to you. Knowledgeable staff. Decently priced. Surprising bottle selection.

Atmosphere 4/5
Service 4/5
Beer 5/5< /text>

The Taproom and Grazzy Burgers next door go hand in hand.  The rooms are interjoining, and whichever entrance you use, you can order beer from the Taproom and food from Grazzy Burgers. If you like a brighter restaurant-type environment then sit on the Grazzy Burgers side, or if you prefer a darker pub atmosphere then sit on the Taproom side.  I’ve been here about half a dozen times (sitting in the Taproom side each time) and have always found the service to be super-helpful and the food to arrive promptly and exactly as ordered. To those that quibble about the prices being a little high, I would disagree - $9 (or even $11) for a burger is not a high price when you consider that the meat is humanely raised, grass-fed, locally sourced, and served on an organic Acme bun… and delicious.

Beer: Check the Taproom website for a picture of their chalkboard listing the 32 or so beers that they have on tap. Mostly local –you’ll see some familiar names (Fieldwork, Henhouse, North Coast, Stone, Drake’s, Altamont) but also some very unfamiliar brews, even from breweries that you know fairly well.  A recent highlight for me was North Coast’s Old Stock Ale, aged in rye whiskey barrels (its brother aged in wheat whiskey barrels was also available). It’s a dark ale, almost 14% alcohol ($8 for 10 oz) but yet isn’t overpowered by the ethanol or the whiskey flavors – it was well-balanced, potent, and very, very good. Another good one was Drake’s Unholy Alliance sour ale, fermented with Viognier grape skins from Rockwall cellars (also $8 for 10 oz). Yep, beer is getting pretty fancy these days and the Taproom is a good place to find out what’s new – and you can also get pints of well-made traditional beers and ales for $5-6. The friendly bartenders were happy to pour samples and frequently checked our table for orders.

Sustainability: I’m also giving the Taproom and Grazzy Burgers experience 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. Green stars you say? Why yes! It’s a new rating scale for social and environmental impact - it’ll catch on ;) The Taproom’s beer is predominantly from very local breweries and many of these (Drake’s, North Coast, Stone, to name a few) are making good efforts on energy use, re-use of spent grains, and philanthropic causes. Grazzy Burgers use mostly organic ingredients, all sourced from Bay Area farms, and again, those excellent organic buns are from Acme. Their meat is grass-fed (corn-free), compassionately raised without stress or confinement, antibiotics, or hormones and their salmon is wild. The pasture-raised beef and lamb comes from employee-owned Sun-Fed Ranch and Superior Farms (the latter is also 50% wind-powered).

The food: I’ve had their black bean fiesta burger, sweet potato fries, Kennebec fries, regular fries, onion rings, and hummus plate. My favorite is the black bean burger ($9), which comes with a side of homemade potato chips (fries is $2 extra). There were maybe four things that stood out: first, it was a real, homemade burger and not a super-dense soy protein or gluten patty and it was satisfyingly filling without being overly heavy. Second, it had this lemony flavor, not over-lemony but providing just enough acid, that really elevated it. I checked the menu and this delicious flavor was coming from the preserved lemon guacamole. Third, it was moist and had enough toppings (the guacamole, pico de gallo, and cilantro lime aioli) that I wasn’t even remotely tempted to reach for ketchup or mustard. Fourth – the bun was great. So many otherwise great burgers are let down by their buns – story of my life really. My friend had the Grazzy Classic beef burger (also $9) and like it a lot too – good bun and cooked to order.</Review>

I have been her more than a couple of times and have to say it's a great little spot. Sometimes the service isn't the fastest or most attentive but the servers and bartenders are hella nice. The food is great and not your basic pub fare. Everything's got a little twist to it, like harrisa ketchup, they've got sweet potato fries and "dino" chips aka kale chips. The beet salad (plus chicken if it strikes your fancy) is pretty stellar. Overall the food tastes fresh and is full of good ingredients. It's hard to go wrong with such a wonderfully vast rotating beer selection and cooler! Definitely a happy camper when I leave!< /Review>

This is a cool little quiet park hidden behind a business park. It was a great spot to get away from from pretty much everyone as there was no one here at all. The park is well kept up, has picnic tables and well maintained trails. At the front there is also a trail connected to it that goes for quite aways back with some cool different plants and trees. There are signs that tell you the different trees and shrubs along the way. I would recommend this spot for a family picnic or to get away from people.<//Text>

Beautiful park for hiking, picnics, riding bikes. I don't recommend it for skating. I was looking for the dinosaurs I saw in pictures, but they aren't there anymore. I would have nice for the kids, though.<//text>

The paved trails are nice, but the dirt paths take you out to some fantastic views.  Whether you're an avid hiker, a frequent walker, or just looking for a nice view, this is an amazing park come go to.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Hidden park and the entrance is kinda odd! I got to use the very long stairs where punch of people were smoking to reach the park. No kids playground. Very quiet park and not very clean. No lights at night. Wouldn’t recommend it for families.</review>

Wow! They are so amazing.
As in All-in-One Package.
Best customer service i'd ever had.
They gave me a great amount of discount.
Accommodation looks like classy yet very cheap price.
Hassle-free.
I will recommend this one to my family & friends. :D<//Text>

Food is tasty, always ready, and the staff is super nice. By far my favorite food, We discovered this place during shelter-in-place and my wife and I always come back. (Big fans of the vindaloo) I can’t wait to eat inside because if their takeout is this good, I can only imagine how good it is to dine-in!<//Review>

The most disgusting sweets you can ever get. The jalebi was pathetic and the Rosagulla was a hybrid version of a gulab jamun....take a look at the color of the jalebi...if you want to spoil your taste buds this is the place!!!</Text>

Ganesha's current low rating of under 3 stars is certainly undeserved.  We thought the biryani, palak paneer, and tandoori chicken was quite good (and respectably spicy, too!).   Absolutely worth a return visit.</review>

<review>I ordered Jalebi online to be shipped to a place 10 miles away from the shop. Jalebi had a bad smell so I, decided to email them. They did not even consider replying to me. When, I was contacted them regarding tracking info email was seem to be working fine. I had to
Email the second time to get a response from them. I told them I will be leaving a review so they responded immediately with;”we had no access to our email.” I asked, for a refund or a replacement. THEY RESPONDED SENT US A PREPAID SHIPPING LABEL AND WE CAN SEND A REPLACEMENT BOX AS A COURTESY TO YOU! What kind of courtesy is this?? Your product was bad so why should I, have to pay shipping. Never heard of this type of customer service. After, going back and forth they said we will arrange a local shipper. At this point, NO THANK YOU!! I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.

Thanks for sending the box but after going back and forth and not receiving your reply anymore, I was no longer interested in the replacement.< /review>< time>

I had ordered food last night. It was the worst biriyani I ever tried in bay area. Their samosa chaat tasted very weird as if tea/coffee had fallen in it. The malai paneer was below average. Money wasted.< /Review>

They send you orange juice and label it as Mango Lassi and all the dishes are flooded with oil. Extremely OILY food with a mediocre taste only if you can force yourself to eat it after seeing the amount of oil floating over the dishes. A big NO for this place.< /Review>< Pics>

I was only one dinner during lunch there. I ordered Briyani. Got in reasonable time. It was serverd in a bowl. Briyani taste was yakki. There was no plate. So I started eaing from the bowl. Almost half way, One senior person came with plate and said "He is new hire.". The raita (yogurt ) was so pungent, I tried only once and did not dare to do it again.

It is more of fast-food factory than restaurant. Jain, beaware they server chicken and ...I went looking for vegetarian food.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808fca6e795e6093:0xc30a8f83a93378b7</GmapID></record>

<Review>Worth reading my review, so please read before thinking of going to this place

Went to this place and none of the food is fresh (I ordered Chicken Tandoori, nan, Prawn masala, Tomato soup). Tomato soup like peas masala, Tandoori chicken is not at all fresh (should be atleast 2-3 days old), Mango lassi is also smelly, sour taste.

We are the only customer that day for Dinner. Saw one white lady who doesn't know anything about items in the Menu (even name). When I told her that the soup is not like soup and it is like masala, she was trying to explain me without knowing our Indian taste !!

I asked the waiter that i want to talk to owner and she went and told him, he didn't come and talk to me. Not even a single $ worth food over there. Food I ordered $38 is total waste !! I don't know even in US, such a worst quality food is being served and no action so far !!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Don't do it!
I was working late and placed an order for delivery, 1 hours later i call them asking for the status of my order, they tell me i can come and pick it up. i inform them I placed the order for delivery, I then get put on hold for over 10mins when someone answers the phone asking what i want. i tell them i've been on hold 10mins trying to get an update of my delivery. I'm then told it would be another 30-40 mins. it's now 2 hours since i placed my order and still no food. NEVER AGAIN</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

No Buffett... Found food ok (nothing great nor worse) except rice which appeared to be heated since some of the pieces were not that soft...that's why rating 2.5 since it was not a buffet lunch yet cudnt cook it good

Butter naan hardly had butter however it was fine (we ate it hot else it wud have been different story, as in wouldn't have been a good naan)

No AC, however they turned on fan after realization (kept door open for natural AC)
Inside could be improved to remove the clutter behind since empty sweet racks don't look that enticing
Didn't see anyone else at lunch time, perhaps I was early ...< /Review>

I went here based upon other reviews.  BAD DECISION !

Food :  Literally Stale
Veggies : Lots of masala gravy with over cooked veggies
Rice : Stale
Chicken : had some weird smell

Overall : Absolute waste of money. Instead go to burger place. Seriously!</Text>

I cant even describe the amount of kindness and professionalism the Team at Avalon Oak Creek has! from the day I came here to look for my new home Norene Santos treated me as if she would her own Family. She was honest, patient and made sure I found the right location and apartment home I was looking for. It took months but she continued to care and follow up. Kevin Dunn, the office Manager even made sure to follow up and go over everything with me before my move in date. Now that I live here- Everyone including the maintenance team is truly like an extended Family that I can rely on and trust! They always make sure to offer a helping had even if it is out of their work hours. I hurt my wrist a few weeks ago and could not take my trash out- Kai who works in the leasing office offered t o come take my trash for me because I could not. Every single employee here is a true gem. I looked at many apartments in the area and nothing compared to Avalon Oak Creek and the amount of professionalism and kindness the team here shows their future tenants as well as tenants. Could not be happier with my decision to move here !!< /text>

It’s easy to provide great service when things are going well but the true test is when things go south. Victor is an awesome maintenance supervisor. You can always count on him to handle the occasional hiccup quickly and efficiently.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Moving here has been an absolute dream. Everything in the apartment from the floors to the ceilings are so well made. I really don't consider this an apartment complex. It feels more like a condo/townhouse.

The noticeable difference here is how quiet it is! I was not used to this at all. (We do live at the very back of the complex and don't face any other units, which is probably why it is so quiet.)

One of our top reasons why we love living here is because of all the things we can do in walking distance. We are able to walk to Trader Joe's (takes 3 minutes), walk to Chumash Park (maybe 2 minute walk), and we've even walked to the Starbucks on Kanan from the park.

We have gone in the pool 3 times in the last week (in the afternoon and in the evening) and nobody was in the pool. Felt so private! The pool is also extremely clean and way bigger than I remembered.

Since our balcony is facing the back of the complex, we do have a view of a warehouse. But it doesn't bother us much since they are only open during the week while we are at work anyways.

The one thing (the fact that there is literally only one thing is amazing) that I wish they had was a spray nozzle for the kitchen sink. It doesn't have the faucet extender so it is a little difficult to spray down big pots in the sink.

Another HUGE plus to this place, ceiling fans! On the lowest level you can't even hear the fan. So we sleep with it on all night.

But probably hands down, one of the #1 reasons why we love living here is the parking. You get 2 assigned parking spots in the underground garage. You have a remote that opens the gate and a key that opens a door on the side of the garage. It's super safe and secure. And then any above ground parking is free to whoever. Not having the stress of no parking (like your average apartment complex) is a huge relief. Yes, this apartment is more on the pricier side, but I'm telling you every penny is worth it. The extra hundred dollars you pay a month is paying for privacy, parking, landscape, the pool, the gym (which is amazing), peaceful surroundings, distance to everything, hiking trails, high quality hardware, large living spaces, speedy maintenance response, super friendly staff, etc.

Also, they have food trucks every month that come and park at the complex! I mean, come on....</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpk7_7bLyxYpAPxmPXm5cjeyjv6co5HRjAOzwY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQvgzo-v6WMBv9Di0LXCQSE8hlw-r-ou0WEVtv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ6m1SqXbelrDrqhxtmqxePNhYHnXyoIhQ9fKm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjJZrLsYtATV1qvs1SjRgVU5qJ5iDuRFQg1-rl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlYP4NZQAR9ybL2DzjTEUdR0bX2bmc1Q2TrQhJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

The people who work in the leasing office are amazing, maintenance is quick, the neighborhood is clean and the apartments are spacious and so nice. Nothing about this place feels like a typical apartment. It truly feels like a home. The customer service from the leasing office staff is above and beyond. It might be on the pricier side but it is worth every penny. I plan on being here for a long time until I am able to buy my own home. :)</Review>< username>

We would like to recognize your exceptional maintenance and office staff at Avalon Oak Creek.  We recently moved in and discovered a few items that needed attention. When we contacted the front office we were greeted by a friendly and very helpful staff member who made this process pain free. Within a day, professional and very helpful maintenance technicians arrived to make the requested repairs.  The maintenance technicians repaired the reported issues, but also went above and beyond by fixing a couple other problems that wasn’t yet reported.

In addition, they arrived prepared with a smile on thier face exemplifying an incredible work ethic. It is greatly appreciated to receive such care and attention in our home.

Overall, the care we have received from your entire staff has been exceptional.

Sincerely,

Nancy Suarez

< Review>
There are many aspects to selecting a place to live. Location, neighborhood, and neighbors. Avalon Oak Creek apartment homes is the ideal combination of all 3 with the added benefit of a truly dedicated and conscientious administrative and maintenance staff who daily show pride in their work.

I moved in late February 2020. I had to call maintenance twice, everything was back in order by the next day.  Special shout out to Maintenance Supervisor Victor Gonzalez, whose professional skills will qualify him as the “Swiss Army Knife” of maintenance, was very diplomatic and kind in explaining how I got myself stuck in the handicap lift.

I have secured parking plus plenty of guest parking. I have easy access to the Ventura Freeway without the noise and smog.  Unlike the Los Angeles basin Agoura Hills provides fresh clean air and a sense of community with an emphasis on healthy living, education and family.  My neighbors, of all age groups, reflect those values.

I was originally looking into a 55+ community where I could maintain a home office and be close to my grandchildren.  Then my son asked, “So Papa, what do you plan to do for the next 30 years?” As long as they are able to maintain the resort atmosphere and excellent staff, I can see myself living at Avalon Oak Creek’s truly apartment homes 30 years from now.</Review>

<review>The move-in process was smooth and so far, every experience with the maintenance and management team has been quick and efficient. Special shout out to Gabby who has gone above and beyond a few times to ensure maintenance properly handled what could have been a messy situation.

As for the amenities, since everything has been suspended by COVID, I can't really provide any feedback.<//review>< Time>

My mother-in-law lives at Avalon Oak Creek and couldn't be more satisfied with the excellent service she receives anytime she has an issue in her apartment.  The service people consistently respond very quickly after the request has been made, are very pleasant, and take care of whatever the problem is without delay.  With respect to the office staff, we have dealt mainly with Edwin,  who has been extremely pleasant,  professional. and helpful, demonstrating good follow through on whatever assistance has been needed. The staff overall has really made a positive difference in the quality of the experience of living at Avalon Oak Creek.< /Review>

I have been here for a year now and am really enjoying my new “home”.
It’s very safe, surrounded with beautiful mountains and hills as well as streams.  It’s also very convenient;  closed to stores, markets , restaurants, parks and excellent schools.
The management staffs are not only nice but also very professional.
I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a very nice home.<//review>

I have been living in Avalon Creek apartments for almost 1 year. I love to live here! Amazing place for living with kids. There are A lot of grocery stories, cafes and more. The best schools! Close to freeway, but I don’t hear noise! Price is not chip and apartments are not new (kitchen), but we love it anyway !

<Date>1544757259515</Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>My husband and I moved to the Avalon Oak Creek after living at another Avalon complex and we love it!

The Avalon Oak Creek is beautiful with underground parking and walking trails in the complex as well as a neighboring (beautiful!!) park and trail to Trader Joe's. It's a short walk to Old Agoura, which we love!

I've enjoyed getting to know other dog owners within the community and have found the majority of our neighbbors to be extremely kind and welcoming!

The leasing office staff is quick, understanding, knowledgeable and very helpful! They TRULY do want their residents to enjoy their homes. We have really loved getting to know them.

The gym and pool area is always clean and can host a number of people without it ever feeling crowded. I have never had an issue in the gym with needing a machine and it not being available- the same goes for lounge chairs by the pool.

If you're looking for a reasonably priced apartment with a beautiful interior/exterior and a great team (office and maintenance) on site, then this is a wonderful option in Agoura Hills!<//Text>< pictures>

We've just moved in and the whole experience has been amazing! Kevin has been an absolute superstar! From the relaxed viewing and answering all our questions, to opening our apartment and loading in furniture that arrived days early (when we couldn't be there) to just mention a few ways he's helped! The whole team here continues to deliver on friendly help whenever needed and they truly do deliver on creating an authentic sense of community! We have two little kids who also love it here! I would recommend living here to anyone!- provided you're nice neighbours! (-;<//Review>

<Review>I have not moved in just yet, but I am so happy I found this place. I had been living at Avalon Warner Place in Canoga Park and decided I needed to be back in Agoura to be closer to my family again. I looked at Oak Creek and decided I wanted to apply. Edwin, my community consultant, has been so so helpful through the transfer process and guiding me through the process of transferring from one Avalon to another. He takes time to answer all my questions and give me updated on where I am on the process.
I've signed my lease and am so excited to move in to such a great community!!!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The best part about living at Avalon Oak Creek is definitely the service. I accidentally locked myself out of the garage in my building on labor day and they were able to help me get in. The move in/ move out process was also incredible smooth and easy! Would definitely recommend to friends!<//review>< Pictures>

Have lived there for 6 months and moved out. After I moved out I called back to ask something, the stuff was really rude and hang up my call while I was still talking claiming that “sorry I need to go”.

The place is not as clean as people described, there are cockroaches on the road during the night. Silverfish and spiders can be seen everyday in the room.

I have moved to Eaves, which is also under Avalon, much better floor plan and even much cheaper price than this Avalon Oak Creek.< /review>

My name is Judy and I also live at Avalon Oak Creek in Agoura Hills.  Last year we decided to move back to Agoura.  I have only the BEST things to say about Rosalind Cox.  Her presentation, knowledge and warm personality made the experience easy and smooth.   The Avalon did an excellent job by hiring such an excellent employee.  Rosalind was there to take care of any question and any situation that needed attention.  I rate her with a 10 !!!!

Kevin, a co-worker of Rosalind, has also impressed me.  I think he is easily another example of a fine employee !

I’ve just renewed my lease (3rd year) because I️ really like the area and physical apartment. However, I️ recently asked the leasing office if they would consider having my carpets cleaned in the high traffic areas (not moving furniture or anything). I️ explained I️ have no pets or stains and would really love if the carpet cleaners so frequently on site could stop by. I️ was quite rudely rebuffed and told this is no longer an incentive.

After three years with only one service request (for our building AC outage) and enduring loud neighbors, the death of the many next door while inside his apartment, endless pool refinishing and no use, rent increases, and a stolen bike, I️ felt like a simple carpet request could have been more kindly turned down.</review>

Avalon oak creek apartments is a nice facility, however, the people and management are unfriendly. Your neighbors will run to management complaining instead of speaking to you about the problem. On one evening, our dog barked while we were away from home for an hour, then later our autistic son had a meltdown and slammed a door. The next day we were threatened with three days notice and eviction if the neighbors complained about us again. This kind of treatment is ridiculous  and broke disability laws. In our 30 days here, before we had enough and left, my kids scooters were stolen off the porch, and my car was vandalized for parking in front of another building.</review>

<text>My family and I our so grateful to be in our Avalon Oak Creek apartment. We have just made a move from Houston, Texas. Where we have lived for 33 years to California to be closer to our daughter and grandchildren.  None of this would have been possible without the wonderful help of Rosalind. She was able to find us a prefect apartment to suit our needs. Moving long distance is always difficult, but Rosalind guided us every step of the way. Our apartment is beautiful and we are very happy to be here. We feel that special recognition should be given to Rosalind. She is a rare find in today's world and a huge credit to your organization.<//text>< name>

My only con is the space in the apartments, but maybe it's just me because all the other places I've lived have been very large.
I will say that all other apartments I looked at within a 20 minute radius seem to be even smaller!  Could just be CA?<//text>< pics>

Since I have lived in this complex for some time, I have had a few maintenance issues. I wanted to specifically mention George from the maintenance crew. Every time George has worked on ANYTHING in my apartment it is fixed promptly and correctly the first time.  He is always friendly and courteous on top of knowing his stuff!<//Text>

Washing machine broke (would not turn on when closed the hatch, not the computerized version, old school). Maintenance crew did a wonderful job, didn't replace the washing machine, but actually fixed the mechanics and replaced a few gagets and now, works like new. Impressed with the work.

Parking space is amazing. No trouble finding parking ever unless building parking lot is getting fixed or painted.</review>

I moved in 10 days ago. The grounds, management, and maintenance team are top  1%. I truly love the fact that we are so close to Trader Joe's :)
Need maintenance over the weekend and they were responsive. The sales team, Nicholas, Grant, and Matt are professional, friendly, and knowledgeable about the area.
I recommend this property.</review>

<text>BAD INTERNET, GREAT AMENITIES - I recently moved in, and this is an (otherwise) great apartment! The staff are congenial and helpful, the layout is well planned out, and it's got a great location near Trader Joes. There's even a pool and a gym! However...
There is a very large problem lurking behind the walls: There's only one ISP, and it's AT&T DSL. The best speeds you'll get here are 40Mbps, and you'll pay $60 per month (With $180 ETF) for the privilege. Time Warner Cable can get you up to 600Mbps for a similar price, but they can't service this apartment because of an MDU Exclusivity Contract Avalon made with AT&T when building it. The sales staff will say they're "Cable Ready", but that's a lie. You can get DirecTV, but that's your only TV choice. If you hate buffering and need a modern internet speed, steer clear.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The employees and the owners are very friendly and accommodating. Though their commodities are limited at this time, we can find most of the basic needs. Another plus is that this store is cheaper than it's counterpart.<//Text>

<Review>The store is under new management and new owners who, are way much friendlier and great customer service. So far, so good. Hoping that they will exceed the quality of service by the previous owner. I like it that they resumed cleaning fishes if requested and fry them for you for a minimal fee.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8094c0a2240bc237:0xa644ff478f3d47e5</gmap_id></record>

A great variety of authentic Filipino food. Stuff I haven't had since childhood. And they just don't look good but also taste awesome! And everybody is very friendly and welcoming , which is why I stopped going to zenny's. That old man and woman at Jenny"s are very unwelcoming and very rude. Unless your part of their circle.<//text>

The guy behind the counter who already had no customer service good attitude, I mean at least fake that your happy I walked in to buy something. Anyways, he just looked at me all weird and said you don't have cash. Ummm If I did don't you think I wouldn't have been holding my card in my hand. Never going back that's for sure.

<Text>Shrimp paste smell greet you, not Asian grocery store, more like 90% Filipino ingredients that Chinese Japanese Korean don't know what to do with. Good if you grow up with Filipino food, I am not a fan of fried pork skin nor the taste.< /Text>< name>

No Halo-Halo but you can get the stuff to make halo-halo. The store is tightly packed like a balikbayan box but they do the job. Sure they are a little ruff inside but hey it is a Filipino store not Wal-Mart.<//text>

They serve food here but do not have access to fresh veggies daily ?
No beansprouts ? No mint ? No basil ?
Basic things you can get at savemart, save yourself a trip. Savemart carries most of the items you want, and more.</Text>

If I could give this place negative stars. Under its new ownership, their employees told me that they stop cooking food at 3:00 pm but the store doesn't close until 8:00 pm.<//text>

This was my first time here and I’m definitely coming back! I called the day I needed an appointment and they took me within the hour! I got exactly what I wanted for my nails, and they were very patient to explain all of options and color selections. This is a very clean salon and they follow all safety procedures right now. Emily made my experience great and did an amazing job on this set!</text>

From 5 stars to 2.

Update: When the owner was doing my nails the first time he told me I could get them filled when it was time. I called while on my way to the shop and was told the price of a fill. I came in to get then filled and was told they do not fill dipped nails. I said to just take them off then and the owner came over and said they could fill them but for a higher price than I was told over the phone for the same service. I loved my nails the first time but the inconsistencies truly bother me. I do not like when people change the price and services once they have you in the chair. I did get a pedicure today and it turned out nice. However I don't think I will be returning here in the future, as I do not like when people play games with my time or money.

Original Post: LOVED my experience! Today was my first visit, I found them off an internet search and I am so glad I did! The service is great and so is the quality of the nails. You can tell they really care about how their customers leave the shop. I am so happy and will definitely be going back.<//review>

I had a very mixed experience. The ladies were extremely nice and helpful however I’m not really satisfied with my nails. I just got them done yesterday and they already look like I need a fill in. It wasn’t busy at all which was nice and the shop is very clean. I just feel like they rushed my manicure. I’ll probably go back once more because the customer service was great, perhaps it was just an off day.< /Text>

My nail tech is Tori and I Definitely love her vibe. All the other nail techs were super sweet they all came over and chit chatted with me. The service was incredibly amazing that I brought my boyfriend back here for a pedi within the next day and they sat us down immediately! Go check them out you will definitely love them.<//review>< Pictures>

Very professional and clean. I don't look for quantity but quality and cleanliness. My nails are perfect every time I leave this place. People in a rush need not apply. Places like this stay in business for a long time for a reason, they are in it for the long haul because they care. Thank you Bryan!< /review>

Not sure why this place doesn’t have more stars!!! The owner genuinely cares that all his customers are happy with his work!!! Made an appointment for a fill and took 40 mins. And I still had time to drive through some food on the way back to work!<//text>

I have gone there twice and their service is so genuine and they are truly one of a kind. The ladies are so sweet and give you advice on whether design on your nails will look good or not. Very caring environment!!! 10/10</Text>

I wanted them flat (not bulky like the pics) and to look natural. I had to have them redo one and unfortunately I didn't have time to redo all so i just left unsatisfied.<//Text>< pictures>

Been wanting to try out the nail dip instead of acrylics but have been to scared to because of the bad service I’ve seen people receive from other nail shops, but this nail shop does amazing work and have truly convinced me to keeping doing gel dip. They also did amazing gel work and art on my feet. It’s best if you make an appointment but it was so kind of them to take us in when they were busy but again appointment preferred. I definitely recommend Tori and Tammy. Tori did the gel dip and Tammy did my pedicure. Both were such a blast and had me smiling from ear to ear. This nail salon is the best and I definitely highly recommend. I will never go to any other salon again. Can’t wait to go back!!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWvaaery9N3pczfzkWc1JoioBLZSiUVlnIs9sw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

When they first said they were finished I could still see the white base color through the color and top coat. I politely asked him to fix the color. Which he did.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>I found this salon by accident while I was visiting the area. I needed someone to take off my gel polish that was over due . They did it quickly and put on polish temporary. I came back 3 days later with my mom and we had a mani/pedi. The pedicure was wonderful , the polish was done perfect and all the “tools” were new and came out of sterilized packets.
The manicure was a dip polish, my first time with this polish and I am now in love with it. The attention to detail and no-rush attitude left my mom and I wishing that  we could find a similar salon near home. I go to Ontario frequently and honestly I may wait till I return to get my nails done! The ONLY negative thing I have to say is that since they just re- modeled the whole salon  and opened the services under new ownership the services were not listed on paper and my moms “person” tried twice to convince her to do more. But I said no thank you and that was it. No big deal.
Thanks for a wonderful mani-pedi and it’s been 10 days and it’s still perfect! Love it!!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfdc_4ZQUABveB1D7dYydnCMFKO4p2ZTapyrwC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIXlc9r7UwM2ivPVHJNlAVw3vWRWQDPv4MCrz7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

The people there were very helpful and took their time working on my nails! This time I got the dipping powder in matte and I got 2 other ladies to try out the powder! They’ve done a fantastic job and almost immediately get seated every time I go :). I definitely recommend this place and will become a regular!</text>

*******NEW OWNERSHIP******

I've always wanted to try the nail dip instead of the acrylic full set. Nail dip feels so much better than acrylic and my nails look so natural instead of looking thick with acrylics. Staff is so friendly and welcoming.
Tory did my nails! I will definitely be back again.<//review>

In CA with my husband for his job. From NC so I didn’t know where to get my nails done and chose this place because it was close to our hotel. So glad I did! The staff was super friendly and did a beautiful job on my nails. Wish I lived closer because I would definitely be a regular here.  I’m probably going for a pedicure tomorrow. I highly recommend this business.</Review>

<Review>Great service, but that wasn't the issue. Called to make an appointment and they didn't honor it nor have records of the call (per person who had answered the call). Then was expected to wait (had to as it was rush hour and the other calls to places near by had a wait too). Great service but unpredictable accountability.</Review>< Response>

So, I give this place 3stars. I went yesterday to get a wax, and full set. Woke up this morning with bruised, and swollen eyebrows. The lady was just so heavy handed on my eyes, she pulled some of my skin with the tweezers, and even missed hairs. Would not recommend getting any kind of waxing (which wasn't a wax, was threading btw). I only give 3 stars because she did do a pretty good job on my nails, so if it wasn't for that, they would definitely get 1star. Oh!, and they arnt sanitary. I pray I don't get an infection. I will not be going back.<//Text>

This place is terrible. The lady cut the skin on two of my fingers and kept putting alcohol wipes on it. She didn’t even use the proper tools , just a mini file. Scraping  the skin of my nails. And when she polished my nails she polished them over cotton and lint that she left on my nails. It’s only been 3 days I got gel nails and the polish is already chipping. Gel nail polish is not supposed to chip after 3 days. Do not go here. They need to be shut down or get new nail techs</Review>

I wanna give 5 stars for Tammy she is awesome but the other staff ruined my experience I couldn’t relax... I kid you not EVERYONE around me was complaining about something the techs were HORRIBLE and didn’t know how to do full pedicure services... a lady next me called at 6pm and it’s 8:05 and she’s still sitting in a chair with NOTHING!! Never will I come back like seriously never

Nail salon is now open under “New Owners” completely remodeled and very comfortable welcoming shop. I went in for a fill and to fix a broken nail. Tori the owner is very sweet and professional. She did my nails ombré/dipping powder and they came out amazing and she did it all in less than an hour. I highly recommend this nail salon. I will definitely be back, this is my go to nail salon. My picture is posted purple ombré.< /text>

<text>Really pretty salon. Tiffany did a wonderful job making my nails pretty. Kim did a terrific job on my pedicure and even helped me to create a special color by using two polishes on my toes to give me that little extra special touch. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town. Susie<//text>< userid>

Most awful experience aside from my pedicure which was great. Smelled like a hospital or nursing home upon entering. The nail tech didn’t listen to my request to fix my nail upon noticing it was crooked. She kept saying she would fix it later; my nail is still crooked. I got a full coffin shaped full set and I can bend my nails like they’re plastic. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.<//review>

<Text>I came here yesterday after work. I got here at about 6:30. The owner Bryan said they normally close at 7 but he would be willing to stay open for me. They just opened about a week ago and they were trying to build a new client base. I wanted a full set dip and pedi. He was soo friendly and personable. Got a pedi from Nancy he was very thorough gentle and Bryan did my nails. I was a little hesitant just because I hadn’t had a male nail tech before. He was diligent quick and did a great job. With all of the people they took AFTER business hours it was about 8:30 before I left. All in all it was a great job and I will be back! Thanks Bryan!<//Text>< rating>

Everything is fresh and clean, all the tools are sanitized, and the buffers, file, etc are used for one client only. They use top quality gel and nexgen powders. My mani/pedi was just what I needed today!< /Review>< username>

I would give them zero stars if I could. This place is AWFUL. DO NOT GO.  Should have been a clear sign to me when I arrived on Saturday afternoon and there was no one else there. The staff was rude, and tried to push other services on us nonstop. But the kicker is that my nails LITERALLY turned yellow the very next day. And by today, 4 days later, one broke in half. It is shoddy, cheap work that they will not fix.  I called and requested that they fix my nails, or issue a refund, and they started playing games in pretending they did not understand me. I finally hung up, I am posting these bad reviews, and then plan to file a charge back with my credit card company.< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Overpriced, unclean, and poor job overall. We got a lot done. Tammy, the owner, wouldn’t go down on price of my husband’s pedicure got $45 one. He was so ticklish he didn’t get his feet scrubbed or massage just his nails cut. Lily cut the edge of my big toes sideways; For sure going to get ingrown toenails. They said they were going to give us a $5 discount and didn’t. Also their wax warmer was filthy. 🤮 I seriously regret getting going there.< /Text>< pictures>

I wish I could give them less stars. This place was incredibly awful. The first thing I noticed was the fact that they couldn't seem to decide whether they wanted to be a jewelry/knick knack store or a nail salon. Either way the atmosphere was very unprofessional.

The second thing that became clear was the lack of cleanliness. All the tools were clearly used and the nail file even fell to the floor and the woman just picked it up and placed it back in the tray. Absolutely disgusting and hoping I don't get an infection.

Third, the pedicure I got was so painful! The woman didn't seem to care that I was visibly in pain and trying to yank my foot away. The callus remover block was unusually rough and she decided to concentrate her attention on the arch of my foot. Not the heels or anywhere that actually might have calluses. My feet are still in pain and torn on the bottom. I doubt she even had a license.

They didn't even seem to have a drying table anywhere. I had to leave with my nails entirely wet.

I have no end to the negative things I can say about this place. Just please take my word for it and skip this terrible place.<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmap_id>

First of All, I got my nails done like half an hour ago and they’re still not dry… The topcoat was cheap. You can find it for a dollar at the fashion store. And second of all when my nails messed up while drying ( due to the cheap top coat ) the lady had the nerve to give me an attitude and a smart remark. “ you want to stay here forever “ ... implying that I wasn’t wanted.< /text>

<Text>The overall service here was terrible. I walked in and asked if they did facial waxing, which the old lady said they did. As I was getting ready for the wax, I was instead met with a thread. I didn't say anything after because I figured that she must know what she's doing and I was in a rush. The cost was extremely overpriced for a facial  threading. Once I got home, I immediately noticed that she didn't even do a good job. I would not recommend this place to anyone.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

There was only one nail technician for two guest. Each pedicure took about two hours per session. The the initial guess did not get a full pedicure but paid for package three which was one of the most expensive choices out of the selection. The nail technician that worked on me, constantly kept messing up on my pedicure, she ended up putting more than four coats of nail polish on my feet .  She didn't seem experience. There was another nail technician on their phone eating in my opinion we could've been working on the second guest but instead as stated above there was only one nail technician working on two guest which delayed my for their activities for the day. All in all they still charge  us full price. We ended up paying $75 for a half job/botched job pedicure.< /review>

I'm trying to plan a b-day for my sister and I live in another state, so I call for pricing and info on services and the gentlemen said they don't really do massages anymore even though it's on their website, I ask "what are your services?" He says that I would have to stop by, I explain that I can't and he says "oh well then ok thanks goodbye", I felt it was unprofessional and rude, we definitely won't be going there<//Text>

We went in for color change on toes and a fill on my fingers and they charged 47$ when they told us 37$. And it took 2 hrs. For not being busy. Not the best.<//Text>

We came to this salon due to reviews; but thought it only right to leave an accurate review
We had 3 people. All 3 of us got deluxe mani/pedies & paid 104$ to get file burns & inexperienced nail techs
They were inexperienced with the chrome process, they weren't willing to listen to what we were saying, they messed up the color choices, more then once.
It definitely was not a relaxing experience, they don't have a smooth process of doing A mani & pedi process & they don't seem to sanitize properly, nails ended up crooked & we left sore and in pain with less then par manicures and pedicures and paid over 100$ for them. We won't be back. And we would not recommend.<//Text>

<review>I've been doing my nails for over 10 years. This place is HORRIBLE. Skip it like the plague. Over priced, ancient nail techs who couldn't put on a nail straight if their life depended on it. Just buy some of the swamp meet jewelry and walk out before your fingers fall off.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Came for a fill, and they did a horrible job! My nails look like I just painted them and dragged them across the carpet.

They are not professional. I spent $74.00 there and got bad service. They do rush jobs and expect a tip for their bad service.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Bad service, uneven nails, injured fingers and the customer pays even if he is not satisfied. A shame. I will not come back.

(Original)
Mal servicio, uñas disparejas, dedos lastimados y el cliente paga aunque no esté satisfecho. Una lástima. No regreso más.<//review>

The last time I went I was told that they are under staffed today. I was told this in a really rude manner. This is the jack in the box that I stop at to and from my destination so I spend let's of my hard earned money at this location and to be talked to in such a way that now has me reevaluating how often I vist here or if I'm going to keep visiting at the location at all anymore. Being busy is a good thing that equals money witch means you get paid so I don't understand why one would talk to a regular paying customer in such away.</text>

Service was good, but we had to pull in the front to wait for the tacos. The employee said, "we're making them fresh". Then after waiting in the front they told us one of the drinks were out. So we ordered a different kind. Then another employee came out and told us that all the drinks have no carbonation. Then she offered us a water. Finally, the tacos were delivered. 2 minutes after we had left, they were cold.< /Text>

They really need to speed up service since drivethrough is the main source of service there, and they need to double check that they give the customer everything they ordered. Other than the 5min wait at the window, and missing the Teriyaki bowl I ordered it was good. Friendly/Pretty  employee.<//text>

Kerman Jack, All I can say is they put the "FAST" back into fast food!! Crew is great. Fast, Fresh AND Friendly these words don't always go together in quick fix food stops, as we all know. Other's should fallow Jack's standers🤔😝😝
KEEP IT UP JACK KERMAN CREW.

I was disappointed they didn't have any egg rolls...had to stay in the drive thru line until the other cars got their orders so I could leave..how do you not have egg rolls...that is the only thing I get and hurry and open the inside dine so I can at least go in instead of waiting all that time in drive thru<//text>

Orders Mozzarella sticks. Was told I have to wait for them to make them. Then when I got them they were old. The cheese was brown the crust was so stale . When I went to take them back the lobby had just closed the line in drive threw had like 7-8 cars. When I called the store no one answers. This place is just horrible. 2 time I have been her and both times was bad.< /Text>

Used breakfast coupons. Great loaded sandwich. Breakfast platter was good but didn't survive the car trip very well. Jack has better food then most other fast food places, but you pay extra for that. Coupons help me pay for it.<//Text>

Horrible late night service. My curly fries came ice cold with just barely enough fries (look like they were half eaten) they didn't give me ranch or ketup like I requested, no napkins and the wait was forever! By far the worst service ever!</Text>

Very poor service people are literally sleeping on there job it's not like it's hard to put some fries in the bag and to top it off I call the manager "Edgar" to tell him they didn't even put my fires in the back after the meal I ordered is $8.60 so I basically paid 9 dollars for a Burger and by the way it's 1:20 am and it's 39 degrees out I'm at home already and all this guy can say is that he'll put me down for fries on my next visit like are you serious who just orders fries on a visit you should just make sure there in the bag in the first place.  Poor customer service skills never again will I go to that location I should have just went to Denny's.< /Text>

Some Jack in the boxes are a hit or miss but this one seems to be good most of the time.  They're just always slow and make u wait in the front which sucks.</Text>

I rarely eat fast food, but I was thoroughly impressed with this place. The presentation and taste was spot on. I ordered the buttery jack and it was perfect. On cleanliness I’d give it a 4/5...< /review>

<review>I think the employee are nice enough but I can't say the same about the management when I produced a free coupon the manager says go around and get in line again I did present the coupon a little late so I asked if I could just go in. she said yes I waited 15 min to hear u have to buy something. So i left .it was clear I just bought something that manager was clearly using third word tactics</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>Staff was fast & friendly. Their soda machine was turned off for maintenance or something but they filled our sodas behind the counter for us. There was also a mishap where a customer in the drive thru got out food we ordered inside. A coworker flagged down the car before it left and gave him the correct food, and made us a fresh batch instead of handing us the food that was in the man's car. They were very apologetic for that which didn't bother me but it was very nice to make everything fresh!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Could not get my order correct three times in a row on the same order. Will never go back k there again. Employees did not know what they was doing when it came to working the soda machine & restarting it. It took almost 45 min just to receive one order with two sodas my sodas was watered down thanks to melted ice waiting for the machine to be reset. Ended up getting drinks from back counter. Worst service ever & very slow.< /review>

Could not get my order correct three times in a row on the same order. Will never go back k there again. Employees did not know what they was doing when it came to working the soda machine & restarting it. It took almost 45 min just to receive one order with two sodas my sodas was watered down thanks to melted ice waiting for the machine to be reset. Ended up getting drinks from back counter. Worst service ever & very slow.</review>

I actually think this is a pretty good store, with one (continual) exception:

"may I take your order?"
Yes, I'll have a medium #2, regular fries, and a diet coke.
"what size?"
Uh, medium.(frustrated)
"would you like regular or curly fries?"
Regular. (angrily)
"and what drink would you like?"
Diet Coke (suicidal)

With God as my witness, this happens EVERY time I order here. They have their routine so drummed into their heads that they actually don't even listen to their customers place an order.< /text>

The district manager Maribel listened and cared and handled my situation like a human not a representative of Jack in the Box. That's how I felt about it . Because of her I will stay going to this location, they have the best mini churros in the valley ..<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>This spot has lost the motivation and respect. About 1 month ago one male worker was bullying 1 female worker about showing up to work early, another male worker for showing up on time "a la verga" he says to him. Then a week later a female worker was rude on purpose and ended up messing up my order so I go back and when I pull up I noticed that her name tag was removed ( the first time I seen it on her).
Tonight I show up and I order 2 tacos, nothing special but when I get home and put sauce on one I noticed it only had meat and cheese and the other one had meat and lettuce. They should close with that service.< /Text>< Pictures>
