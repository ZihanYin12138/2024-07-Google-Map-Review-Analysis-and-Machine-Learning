< Review>
Excellent wine selection, with a good selection of California wines (including some wines from lesser known Northern CA regions) along with some international wines. Prices were reasonable and the pours were generous. We had the bruschetta and it was excellent! Atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, and all of staff we interacted with were friendly and knowledgeable.<//Review>

The owners Jeff & Jeremy are so involved and care about their customers and it is just welcoming. We have never had a bad experience since they have opened. I recommend Platinum to anyone who enjoys good wine and a relaxing atmosphere! Thank you guys! You are all great! Cheers <3</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Really enjoyed this place. They had great service and charcuterie boards. I didn't try the charcuterie really, but my friend's seemed to really like it. They got the Bavarian pretzel board as well, and there was no pretzel left when it was time to go.
The build your own wine flight is an awesome idea!
I ordered kne wine initially that I ended up being not very fond of, but the wine lounge was accommodating and replaced the glass with something else better.
Good service, great, open and airy modern-lined environment. I'd definitely recommend going here.
I actually like it much better than House of Oliver if you need a comparison. House of Oliver is very dark inside and kind of cave like, like a wine cellar. But Platinum Wine is well lit, open and enjoyable. I will be returning here.</review>

Attempting to have a memorable milestone birthday celebration during these times can be a very trying thing.  Platinum Wine Lounge made that happen this weekend for my sister.  We rented the back room for a small gathering and from the time we walked in to decorate we received excellent service.  The waiter assigned to our party was very attentive, made sure the appetizers were served in a timely manner, cleared away the dishes so we could continue to enjoy our time.  Did a lovely job with the cake presentation and serving.  The owner introduced himself to us and checked in our us mid way through.  He also arranged to have the live performer sing Happy Birthday.  It was a very memorable evening and everyone enjoyed the food and wine.  The owner mentioned they just opened up a few weeks ago, so please show them some love and support by visiting them for a glass of wine and some food.< /Text>

This place is fantastic! The food and drinks are amazing and the service is exceptional! Everyone really goes out of their way to give you the best service there. I really love the atmosphere too. Even with the closing of the inside with COVID and having to seat everyone outside, my friends and I were getting served with all smiles even in the scorching heat! I'm pretty sure I've met all the owners and they are great guys. I am now a customer for life!< /Text>

First time here with 4/5 friends. I purchased the Platinum flight which was excellent. Nice to see an expensive bottle of wine served by the glass. Charteruteri board was excellent ( I left the selection up to the chef). 2 other's had a nice (expensive) Chardonnay by the glass and one had the house offering from the central coast, which was also excellent at $6.00 a glass. The chicken skewers with tazekie was excellent, as was the salmon and a panini.
It was nice and quiet until about 5:30 when a large group of women changed that. No social distancing.
Very comfortable chairs. Great wait staff.
Looking forward to returning.< /Text>

<text>We have been here four times and we continue to be impressed.
*Best service in Roseville (seriously, Mike is amazing)
*Swanky comfortable decor
*Reasonable prices on food, wine and beer
*Good vibe!  It’s just that intangible quality. I can’t put my finger on it, but this place is so different from other places around here. The vibe is classy without being snobbish.
Thank you Platinum!</text>< pics>

<review>We were so excited to be a part of the soft opening of this great new local wine venue.  Very few places do such an amazing job of featuring both local wine and beer options with the ideal small plates to pair with the drinks.  A knowledgeable and super friendly staff help to put this place over the top. This was our first time visiting, but definently will not be our last.</review><response>None<//response>< user_name>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>this lodge returns a great value for money, the staff is friendly and you can hang out  24/7 in front of the fireplace in the main lodge. it is close to many attractions around. the lake outside is astonishing and is a great plus to the atmosphere.
the food in the breakfast and dinner is rich and tasty.
the bath is a bit dated but still fine.
I'd highly recommend it.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmD6jml0MmU3l8Pg8yw0VlYFnf4AxLpJQC_Hrk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtK_R5RPICnz4ZN02d4OgGsHsdUn4ykhm6VfSV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObR2XW9NR3R1_TG84dt3oKX5YZferrjNsljF8P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDYGUrnXjC-Ts-bGMSSe9WD29uNxbn9BJdm58Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3ptQqrgCgx43WECVusXmigVkJPDGbI6Vw3OKe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUM7hK_9jJAiy-LB2IMBdvCPtjkcXC7KFfkbv8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk5-36hrYVUGaWrzCcrrSR_ZMXy8ddo_brhjeJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
The staff was friendly and informative. Their food was good. The gentleman who made breakfast knows how to season food! There were activities even in this time of social distancing. Our room was clean and thank God free of bugs. They started a fire during dinner and it created a wonderful atmosphere. I really really enjoyed staying and hope to go back again both in summer and again with the snow.<//Review>

<review>Great place for the family.  The lodge was very accommodating to our needs with traveling with a baby.  The staff was very friendly.  The rooms were nice.  The downside when they said it was all-inclusive they want to charge 25 dollars a person to walk on the trails.  They are located in a secluded area and you already pay to enter the National park.  I feel you should be able to have access to their trails from the property<//review>< user_id>

What an amazing place to stay in the Winter!  I was a little reluctant when I heard about snow conditions and that we would have to be escorted into the property,  But with a paor of snow chains (yes, you need them!) and a friendly escort from Eric/Zoot, we made it to this incredible, secluded, beautiful lodge.In addition, your breakfast, lunch and dinner are included, and the meals were terrific - pork tenderloin, asperagus, chicken for dinner; made to order eggs, bacon, omelettes, pancakes for breakfast.And the scenery is breathtaking, with large sequoias on the property and dozens of peaks in view.My one and only complaint was a lack of electrical outlets in the room (there was only one accessible).  But everything else was outstanding.And more kudos to Eric/Zoot; who not only led the escort, but also helped us and at least one other family with putting on the snow chains.  Outstanding service!< /Text>

<user_name>ribbt mcabe</user_name><rating>4</rating><review>Everything good but the food.
We were pleasantly surprised to discover this lodge within the park, open during covid, with everything needed to play in the snow. It made logistics so easy.
Kong in the ski shop was awesome. Tubes and sleds free. Reasonable rentals on x country skis and snowshoes to use on site.
40 acres of nice pine forest with groomed trails - it is hilly. Great mountain views. The lake was not open for ice-skating.
Included food was sometimes very poor and one time it was good, but they still need to know how to treat a fresh vegetable when they get one.
Even without the food, it's still a good value, so I'd probably come again prepared with some good snacks and low expectations.

The room was totally comfortable with nice linens and a good view. Good heating but cold floors on ground level- I recommend slippers!

Finally the staff were great. Overall it's a great place to land and stay put for a few days of outdoor activities.<//review>< Response>

A wonderful experience and a great place to relax. First of all it was very well kept and clean. The meals were fresh and delicious with choices to help with picky eaters. The staff were friendly and helpful especially Brittany and Tatum at the front desk.</text>

Where do I start, first off the staff are awesome and make sure you are comfortable. Big Buffalo Bear gave us some amazing tips on trails nearby.  The food was amazing, first night was prime rib! The Chef Will (my apologies if I got it wrong dude) did an amazing job with the food. Ok, the views. They are quite breathtaking anytime of the day, morning noon and night. There are more then enough activities to keep the kiddos occupied so no worries folks, sleds and tubes are there for your use. The rooms are clean and cozy, we stayed in the Sugar Pine Lake View Lodge this time. Remember folks you get no cell service there and internet is limited, great way to disconnect from everything. There is a phone available there for you to use in the lodge. Even with everything going on with covid-19 we still have an amazing time, they took all the necessary precautions, great job all around. we already booked another stay, this time one of the fancy forest cabins. I will say this is one of the best kept secrets of Tulare County, see you all again soon.< /review>

< review>
I give 3 star because of the friendlyness of the staff and the location.
Value for money in our case was 2/5 ($170 night). But the weekend prices are $350/night which is a complete ripoff. Expect a room worth $30/night, the rest is the extra you pay for the location.

Positive:
- friendly staff, helped in getting there
- location

Negatives:
- was almost impossibile to get in into our room due to snow, the patio, and stairs were covered w/ ice and snow
- very very small room
- no blackout curtains nor shading on the windows
- expect no dinner if you stay for 1 night (and no launch if you arrive I assume after 7, despite the fact it has been discussed with the front-desk to pack our dinner as we arrived after 5-6 hrs drive)< /review>

Just here to give an honest review... The family was super stoked to go here and overall it was a good experience. Great location and our upscale cabin was perfect... (Shout out to Eagle, who was great with the kids program.) However, many little things were lacking. A fresh coat of paint, some tidying up, and a lit pathway at night would have really raised my opinion. All of the staff were very nice except those in dietary. They were less than enthused to be there to say the least, and although I don’t mind music playing on one of their personal devices, I’d appreciate a song that wasn’t dropping the F bomb multiple times through out the chorus as my 10 yr old is patiently waiting on her plate. If we ever fly across the country again to return, we’ll try somewhere else.<//text>

One of the best parts of my adventure in Sequoia and Kings Canyon.  I love the lake and the accessibility to canoes and such.  I love the top notch food and included three meals per day and all the milk/cereal/coffee/tea/soup all day long.  The views all around are 100% beautiful.  The staff was warm and happy.  Very relaxed and reasonably priced.  Loved it.  Any to go back.</Text>

They also offer free meals that were very delicious!   The staff were super friendly and even offered a free glass of wine upon check in.

<Text>The staffs made our stay a memorable experience.  From the time of check-in to check-out, we've met different staff members and they're all very pleasant and helpful.  We return to this lodge every time we visit Sequoia, and this trip did not disappoint. The room was clean; however, our kids did find someone's pair of socks in the nightstand drawer. Other than that, the room was prepared on time and met our expectations.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>None<//Rate><Review>Surprisingly nice for a lodge in a national park.   We had one of the "family cabins" which could sleep up to six with a king bed, a double sofa bed, and a loft with two bunk beds.   The unit seemed to have been recently remodeled and was quite nice.    The view from the back deck was also very scenic.The food was surprisingly good, though it is a shame they were not allowing us to eat in the main lodge dining room -- there would have been plenty of room for social distancing.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80955d83d7564403:0x18b3053cbdf85e46<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>This place is currently full of people not wearing masks. I entered the ski shop this afternoon and immediately left when I found it packed with people, nowhere close to 6 feet apart, and several of them not wearing masks.

Then this evening I went to the lodge and it's full of people just not wearing masks.

Don't come here.< /review><username>Daniel Sank< /username><gmapID>0x80955d83d7564403:0x18b3053cbdf85e46<//gmapID>< user>

We loved this camp style lodge. Dinner and breakfast are included with your stay and really makes life easier with the limited options in the park. The staff is very friendly. We were in the main lodge in room 101, it is a bit dated but with the view, we didn’t care!</Text>

A little pricier than other available lodging in the Sequoias but meals provided and amenities really made it worth it. Loved our family suite and additional bathroom/showers right in the same building. Pool/spa does close at dusk (not 24 hours) and we saw a large gathering at the camp fire (without social distancing or masks). We ended up eating our meals in our room to avoid crowds.<//Text>

< review>
Fantastic Lodge up by Sequoia! We had a great Christmas experience, we were surprised with an upgrade to one of the newer Forest Cabins! The Staff are friendly, the lodge offers great activities and provides a warm refuge from the cold in winter. We just spent Christmas up here, and would do so again. Word to the wise, this is not a resort, it is a lodge. It's all very rustic. You will be surrounded by people. That's part of the fun, talking and interacting with other real people and families. Meals are communal and on a schedule. You will not be waited on hand and foot. That is not a lack of service, just a reality of the type of establishment. The staff operate the facilities for hundreds of people....daily. They have wifi, but its only available in the lodge, but its connection is at best suitable for texting and email. Rooms do not have TV, nature is the star of this show here! I love this place and can't wait to return, maybe for a summer trip next!!< /review>

Love this place around Christmas, especially when there is snow. The lodge serves a breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet which is included in your stay. They also offer activities through out the day like hiking, archery, skiing, arts and crafts..etc we stayed at a cabin with a shared bathroom.</review>

<review>Best lodge I have ever visited. Good service, nice and kind crew, good food included 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner)! They provide variety of entertainments in and outdoor for summer and winter visits .
For sure best place to visit with family or friends.
I felt as I was a child in kids camp back in 90s surrounded by love, smiles and care, when time flies and you don't want to leave

Will come back 100%</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2nR00rRuwbdzh3of-WsDXtDj3dMifSA9gzPuB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaH3POKPIHeoJiMixDFj9NIq2VL9GQo0OULTqL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7hWYUbP6pnXKCggRawwU_ipHsB7dV-EyBXym1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

Paying almost $400/night for a 1-star room was not worth it,  specially when the room was not even available. We had to wait until 8:30 pm. I guess the location is worth 5-stars, but definitely the room was not.<//Text>

This is a beautiful place. You get your own cabin and are surrounded by nature. The huge trees and other cabins make it feel like you are in the middle of the woods. The main lodge is also great. You get to play bingo and have a chance at winning prizes. There was a bond fire where the kids were able to make s'mores. The food was delicious too! There were salads, fruits, vegetables, meat, desert, and much more. Overall I would definitely recommend staying here.<//text>

<review>Gorgeous location, doesn't get better than this. The room, although, was sad. We got a lake facing room at Sugar Pine lodge. It had water stained ceiling tiles and chewing gum stuck in one of the tiles, right above the bunk bed. Eww.
Food at the dining hall was fresh and tasty. There were vegetarian options too ( for my Desi friends, who don't eat meat).
Outside was a winter wonderland, inside, like an outdated and badly maintained motel. If I am paying so much, I at least expect it to be clean and un-eww. So, more like 3.5 , but rounded to 4..
But I understand that we paid for the whole experience, not just the room. Would I go again, yes ! It's so beautiful.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX59BXnRJ2iZ75eGv5_SS_soQakuB903v5gg7r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQpV2liIjSbriWGSIury61wpg0L5_M1a_Pfl5o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5s3htUfASXOq3cQrHPv-5W9n6JaGETZxttPBJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGIDYlrpBw4CU6T6hp0tNdAFNRaTzTbF9SMKxv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7aJIWMrPJ7yHPhffhTYgT-ci8me1qmmWn7B6I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjg2PVeKpBxnBwYGdN2jaVCuUXCJE3GfzmqWHR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcKbcNaFjmRLFVaO34z83jbAFZWAK5rkxWBsAW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

The worst part was the entrance slope and skidding backward in your vehicle if you never drove up steep icy road very disappointing. I also didn’t appreciate the snood attitude from the staff. The cook was wiping his forehead from sweating and handling our food not sanitary. I will not ever return to this place.< /text>

We just finished a four day family adventure camp here, and we had a blast! This Lodge is right in the middle of the action at Sequoia/King's Canyon National Parks. It is an easy drive from here to any of the major sites or hikes in either park. The lodge itself is nice, and offers a ton of activities for those who just want to stay on the property. You can boat on their lake, swim in the pool (or the lake), practice archery, shoot air rifles, do arts and crafts, star gaze at night, and a variety of other things as well. The staff here are great. In addition to leaving the on property activities, they will also guide hikes, and are generally knowledgeable about the parks. They are always friendly and good with kids. The meals are included, and you can pack lunches if you will be out on a day hike. This is definitely glamping; the rooms are more Marriott than tent. That is my speed, but if you are into something more rustic, then look elsewhere. The one caveat is that there is one TV on the property, and the internet is pretty laughable. However, unplugging added to the charm and family atmosphere. At the end of the day, this was a great way to see the National Parks and spend some time with the family away from the world. I would highly recommend looking at this as a vacation option.< /text>

< review>
It was amazing! I have a 5 & 9 year old so I never truly get to relax while on vacation but at the Montecito Sequoia Lodge I got the opportunity to unwind with my husband like never before. Everything was done for us & the staff was super friendly. I didn't have to worry about cooking or finding a decent restaurant, all three meals were included with our stay and they were actually delicious. There was no need to leave the lodge due to all the activities that were provided. We went canoeing in the lake, my son took archery lessons, we took a few beautiful hikes, made s'mores around a bonfire, played basketball & enjoyed the games they have in the lounge area. There were no televisions in the room but my kids didn't even notice!   I honestly recommend this place to families looking to get away & create unforgettable memories. The surrounding views are breathtaking, there's plenty to keep you occupied, the staff is friendly, my room was clean, the food was delicious! what else could I ask for?
I'll definitely be returning!</review>

<text>Probably one of the best getaways I have ever experienced. It wasn't perfect (small bathroom, fairly old carpets, poor wi-fi), but I'm more than happy to return for repeat visits. The staff are all helpful, friendly and kind, plus the location is so beautiful and the facilities are well-maintained despite the weather (and probably the age of the building). Food is great, and I appreciated the free-flowing beverages — plus the leftovers in the fridge, which everyone, even the staff, are welcome to 24-7.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXl38a4FF0BldX3rStJz7L7AG392PONuxH6PM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80955d83d7564403:0x18b3053cbdf85e46</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The area was very beautiful although the rooms are a bit dated and could use a bit of maintenance. We had a room with one king bed, a bunk, and private bathroom. The bathroom was quite large but the room was a bit tight. Unfortunately it was quite chilly when we stayed in late Sept and couldnt use their pool. Hot water was available and dinner and breakfast was included in the price. The food was buffet style and there was a good variety of food and drinks. The parking lot is a bit away from the cabins although you can park closer to unload. However if you have wheeled luggage you need to drag it across unpaved dirt areas to your cabin and some cabins are quite far away. Overall it was an enjoyable stay. We walked around the small lake in the morning and it was quiet and beautiful.</Review>< UserId.>

<text>The property was beautiful and very picturesque. The fact that meals were included was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly. My only complaint is that there was extremely limited WiFi, mostly only in the lobby. Because of the location of the hotel, there is little to no cell service, and lack of WiFi all over the property is frustrating. Especially when you do not have TVs in the room.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Great location, easy to get to both Sherman and Grant tree areas. Every employee was very friendly and the place had a good vibe about it. The inclusive breakfast and dinner buffet was surprisingly good, and just what my girlfriend and I needed before and after hiking all day. Our room in the main lodge was definitely no frills, but it was clean and comfortable. There isn't any cell service and the WiFi is slow, but that's not why you go to Sequoia National Park. All in all it was a great stay and I'd definitely visit again.<//Text>

Great food, wonderful and enthusiastic staff, coupled with amazing views are keeping us coming back. Activity options abound and the kids are well handled by the staff so the adults can enjoy themselves guilt free. Best for families with children, but enjoyable if you're interested in the art, activities and ambiance as a couple or group without kids.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Cabins are perfect for large groups with your own fireplace! Right next to a lake and you can see the mountains afar. The shared shower/bathhouse is warm and cozy. So much food at the center kitchen area with even extra apart from all three meals daily. Our stay was interrupted because of road closures after unexpected heavy snow and Tiffany was wonderful to explain the situation and help us with the refund.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My sister, daughter, and I were doing a spontaneous road trip from San Francisco to San Diego and stopped here without a reservation.
We were given many different room options and chose the queen and double bunks. We split the bill three ways so it was very affordable.
Especially when you consider what was included!
Breakfast, lunch, AND dinner.
Also, a cheese and wine tasting, EVERY night. And then, as if that weren't enough, S'MORES!! Every night.
The staff made everyone feel like family, including a space in the fridge, in the kitchen, for guests to put personal food items.
This place rocks, I didn't want to leave! Especially with snow covered peaks...
BTW, the view off the balcony is to die for.< /text>

My family and I were there for weekend visit. It is little expansive but it does include breakfast and dinner. The log cabin contains natural log burning fireplace. They had community bathrooms with very nice hot showers. They provided shampoo, conditioner, soap, and bath towels in cabin. They also have swimming pool and jacuzzi if you want to soak after hiking trails. The lodge is next to lake where the guests could use canoes, kayak and paddles. They provided tea, coffee and hot chocolate 24 hours a day. We enjoyed our stay.<//review>

<response>None<//response><Text>We liked our stay, but didn't know it would be so rustic. No tv, limited wifi, nonexistent cell service. The dining hall is beautiful in the lodge. The food in the buffets was very good, home made bread, great salad bar, good soups, and wonderful breakfast buffet. Our only complaint is that when I asked for a first floor room and said my husband couldn't walk well, no one told us that you couldn't park near your room and that the walk to the dining hall was a good distance, especially in the cold temps! My husband skipped breakfast as he didn't feel he could walk to breakfast and do the walking to load our stuff back in our truck, too hard on his bad knee and breathing. The heater in our room cabin was excellent for the cold weather. Bed was very comfortable.< /Text>< Pictures>

Our cabin did not have running water or central heat, however we had just spent three days in a tent, so this was an upgrade! The free breakfast, lunch and dinner made up for it! Beautiful rustic property and you CAN get a cabin with water if you ask.</Text>

Best lodge I have ever visited. Good service, nice and kind crew, good food included 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner)! They provide variety of entertainments in and outdoor for summer and winter visits .
For sure best place to visit with family or friends.
I felt as I was a child in kids camp back in 90s surrounded by love, smiles and care, when time flies and you don't want to leave

Will come back 100%</Text>< Pictures>

5 star experience for our children (aged 4 & 5), trampoline was a huge hit, plus fishing off the dock in the lodge's own lake, kayaks are there for you to help yourself. We did a lot of arts & craft, which the children loved. The counsellor staff seemed bit disinterested though (it was mid to late Aug after 10 weeks of family camp). We stayed in a king & bunk bed room in the original lodge - the room is adequate but dated, bathroom is tiny. Food is plentiful but quite salty.< /Text>

The setting was gorgeous on the lake and I was greeted by a friendly cat on the way up to the lodge. However, the outside of the buildings looked a little rundown and that they could use a paint job. I went into the lodge briefly to eat dinner but after looking around and seeing the place I decided to leave. I'm sure the food would have been fine but there was a line and I didn't have time to wait.<//text>

<text>Perfect! Everything in the area was booked and we stumbled on Montecito the night before we were going to be traveling through the Sequoia NP on our way to Yosemite NP. At first I thought it was pricey, but breakfast, lunch, and dinner are included; plus all sorts of activities! Food was much better than expected, buffet style and plenty of options

The staff makes you feel very welcomed. Big thanks to Patricia for getting us squared away and being so helpful!

We will definitely be back!</text>< pics>

For $300 a night, we got an unfurnished cabin w/o AC or bathroom, in the center of Sequoia National Park in early July peak season.  However, this includes free breakfast, lunch (they also provide packed sandwich bag w/ snacks and fruits if your reservation includes it and you order the night before), dinner (salmon, rib, salad, ... It ends at 7PM, arrive at least 30 min before that!), as well as kayak, stand-up paddle, pingpong, foosball, ...  Kayaking in the small lake is fun and relaxing.  At night, they have camp fire and marshmallow for kids too.< /text>

We absolutely loved staying here. It was great that it was all inclusive and that we didn't have to worry about our meals. The kids loved having access to cereal 24/7 as well as hot coco...s'mores at night helped too. I would definitely bring the family back here in a heart beat.<//Review>

<text>The best part about this lodge is that it is located right in between Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in a perfect location to explore both parks with minimal wasted time in driving.  It has a summer camp feel and includes three meals a day (with a paper bag lunch to bring on hikes). I spent 4 days in the area and was able to cross all of the most popular hikes and sites off of my list.  Downsides are minimal and easily overlooked.  No TV in the room, some would call the rooms a little dated but I only used to the room to sleep, WIFI worked in lobby but hardly in the room.  Upsides are the best location, excellent breakfast to start your day of hiking, excellent dinner, friendly staff.  I drove by the 3 other lodging choices (StonyCreek and Wuksachi and John Muir) located in and around the parks and they seemed to be just as dated.  There are no Ritz Carltons or Hiltons or other high end resorts in this area but I do think this lodge is one of the best in the park vicinity.  Overall, I had a great time and would stay again at the Montecito.<//text>< username>

Such an amazing and beautiful place with great staff! I've been coming for 7 years now and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves to go camping but doesn't want to worry about staying warm or making food. It's also a great place to make lifelong friends.</Text>

We were here just to eat because we had accommodations at Stony Creek Lodge, which is a "sister" property about 1/4 mile down the road. The food, which was lunch and dinner for us, was fresh and delicious.  Lunch was sausage, hamburgers, veggie burgers, a fantastic salad bar, peas and the best homemade potato soup I've ever had.  There is a self-serve drink dispenser and it's family style seating.  Also, you clear you own place, too.  Dinner was King Crab legs and prime rib.  The prime rib was gone when we got there, so the chef made us our own NY strip steaks.  The salad bar was once again, fantastic and there were potatoes, and veggies as sides to the meal.  We didn't get dessert, but it was cobbler.  Since we had a room at Stony Creek Lodge, we got a 25% discount.  Still pricey (29.00 for lunch, 79.00 for dinner), but delicious after a day of hiking.< /Review>

We love this place.  Our first visit was three years ago and we have returned every winter since.  No TV, no cell phones.  Leave the electronics at home and enjoy the outdoor activities. There's plenty of books, puzzles and games for the kids inside when you need to warm up. Perfect for families and kids.  My 4 year old can't wait to get there.  Even the food service is great.  I have never found a better deal to entertain my family.  One day I hope to visit during the summer too.<//Text>

Stayed here a couple of times over the years - the food and the service have remarkably improved. The staff are friendly, meals are served buffet style. The sack lunch option is really a great feature if you are planning a day hike. There are often vegetarian options at the meals. The rooms in the lodge are cozy, with few amenities (but if you're after amenities then Sequoia is not for you). The lodge is kid friendly so be prepared for families. There is a small, but full, bar open in the evenings for your post hike brew. Plenty of trails and sights within driving distance.< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>This place is quiet and nice. It's not luxury resort, but it does save time without in and out of the national park. They have wine tasting and cheese tasting in the late afternoon before dinner. The breakfast and dinner are included is nice.

We stay at the room in the main building, which is small. It's enough for two. Although the bed sheet isn't matching, but we don't really care. Consider the time driving back and forth in the nation park, we'd rather pay a little more to stay in the park.

There is a little lake that is beautiful in the early morning. See my photos. They also have a swimming pool with mountain view. It looks like a luxury mountain ranch.<//Review>< pics>

Even with a winter storm warning, their snow-plow escort got us safely to the lodge, where we enjoyed sledding and other winter fun amid several feet of fresh snow. Meals were included, but selections were limited and not great in terms of quality. Accommodations vary depending on the choice you make - the newer cabins are great.</review>< rating>

Convenience was the name of the game for us.  We wanted to spend two days in the park hiking and had originally planned to drive to the nearest town to go to a hotel.  That would have been about 4 hours of driving in and out of the mountains.  We drove past the lodge in the afternoon and went in and asked for a room and they had one so we stayed.  The staff was great, other guests were friendly.  Dinner and breakfast were included (nice surprise).
It had a very rustic lodge type feeling.  We had breakfast by the fire in the morning.  We were there in late April and there was still lots of snow, but we were just hiking.  Others were snowshoeing.  It costs a little more than a typical nice hotel room but the free dinner and 4 hours of drive time and gas offset that extra cost easily!</review>

The Montecito Sequoia Lodge was honestly such a nice place to see scenery. The only hassle I had was having to maintain the fire and having to go out of my cabin and into a different cabin so that I could shower and use the restroom. Other than that, all the employees were really friendly and just the outside was beautiful.</review>

The activities, lounge and activities are all great. The location is amazing with easy access to all parts of Sequoia National Forest. Meals are included and we met alot of interesting people while sharing a table. They will make you a trail packed lunch for hiking, which is really cool. The rooms are fine.<//review>

This is one of the best vacations we have had. The rooms were cozy and the views were spectacular. They were a little ridged about meal times but it was not major problem. The meals were delicious as were the cocktails. We will be staying here again.</text>

Quaint, cozy lodge. Great place to stay inside Sequoia National Park. All meals are included which is nice considering there aren't really any places to eat inside the park. They also had free wine and cheese tasting from 4-6 while we were there! Very family friendly with different activities like archery and s'mores making daily.<//review>

This place is well located to visit and hike around the park. The rooms in the main building are clean, spacious, but not fancy. The staff is extremely friendly. Their prices are very reasonable ($130 for a room with mountain views sleeping 4) and they provide breakfast, lunch and dinner (included in price). The food is nicer than your typical "camp food" and you can tell they make an effort to change the menu and have a variety of items, including vegetarian options. You eat in a large hall where all guests can mingle, play board games, or sit by the fireplace. I highly recommend it.< /text>

Absolute gem. Convenient location in park - easy access to both Grant and General Sherman trees. Fantastic dinner, cozy lodge atmosphere, and plenty of activities for the whole family (trampoline, tennis, archery, ping pong, pool and hot tub, etc.) Rate includes all meals - great value!</Text>

<text>We took a week to visit with our kids and my wife's parents, and found this to be the perfect place for an extended family getaway.  The buffet for breakfast and dinner made it easy to get in and out with the kids, and we took a packed lunch out into the park almost every day.  The food is decent.  The views off the back deck of the lodge/dining hall are incredible!

The rooms were adequate, but nothing fancy.  We took one half of one floor of a small dormitory-like building, with two bedrooms, a living area, and a bathroom.  It seemed a lot like a summer camp dorm (and I think it was, sometimes!), but we didn't spend a lot of time there anyway, as the whole point was to see the park.

There were guided activities for kids, from arts and crafts to sports to who knows what.  We were gone during the activity hours most days, but my (at the time) four year old enjoyed them on the day or two we were in.

The Wi-Fi was terrible, and there was no cell phone reception to be found anywhere around.  That was mostly OK for us since we were there to get away, but it was inconvenient a few times.  Cell reception isn't much better in most of the park, although there are a few places that overlook towns in the distance where connectivity is OK.

Parking is a fair distance from the lodging, but they let us bring our car in briefly for unloading and then to load up again to leave.</text>< Time>

<Review>The place it's awesome,  to relax, go out of the city and take some great vacations,  3 meals are included,  the dinner is good, you can have drinks,  cereal, fruit, all day long at the lobby.
Just they don't clean the areas, including your room, after you arrived there, nobody goes and offers you room service or at least clean towels or toilet paper, out of the rooms is dirty; the people at the office are not friendly at all.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80955d83d7564403:0x18b3053cbdf85e46</gmap_id></record>

Great place to stay.  Being inside the park was fantastic. Breakfast was good with cold and cooked items. Know that there is no cell service out here and that multiple mountainview cabins share a bathhouse. I think the forestview cabins have individual bathrooms but ultimately do not know.< /review>

<review>Just got back from a night at the Montecito Sequoia lodge - I heartily recommend it to everyone. This was my first time up to Sequoia and the Kings Canyon national parks in winter. Most of the roads were closed at this time, but the lodge was easy to find and turned out to exceed my expectations. Situated at a very scenic location on the banks of a small lake it offers tons of activities for people of all ages. In the winter there are activities like snow-shoeing, sledging etc., while during summer one can engage in archery and a lot more. They have also got lots of games which one can spend time playing with if one has to stay indoors. No television - but why do you need that in an amazing place like Sequoia. Internet works in the main lodge, so you can still keep in touch even though your cell phone won't work anywhere else.The rooms were comfortable, service was really good. But the best part about this place was the meals they serve - amazing buffets with food that tastes home-made. I'm going back here in summer, and this time I'll try to stay longer.<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>2</rate><Text>Location was fabulous.
But it’s a shame that the cabins are not as a high standard. First of all, our cabin was not appropriately equipped as our kitchen had nothing in it for us to be able to use it.
Secondly, the bed sheets were yellow (as in dirty).
Finally the food was okay but for the price, it had a lot to wish for. For example, the chocolate milkshakes were 6 days out of date.
Overall the place was not well maintained.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80955d83d7564403:0x18b3053cbdf85e46</GmapID></record>

If the following day is not your departure day, then you can order a free bagged lunch for each guest (if the next day is your departure day, then there is a charge, currently $10 each at the time of this review). If you get back late and miss the dinner, then you can get leftovers from the fridge where labeled.<//review></record>

<Name>Beryl Reid<//Name><text>You know that feeling that you have uncovered a "hidden gem" ? This is that gem! We were exploring the Yosemite, Sequoia National Parks in late October. We booked a two night stay at the Lodge. I can't rave enough about the experience. It's not "fake boutique" or "snobby upscale - cookies on the pillow" kind of place. It's authentic Lodge in the mountains. The staff were friendly, helpful and skilled. The food was all included and it was fabulous! Full ( anything you could dream of) breakfast, lunch and dinner. The cooks were great. It was family style - serve yourself in a large, warm, comfortable lodge room with a huge fireplace and leather sofas. They had activities planned everyday for the kids and the adults with a 5-6 wine tasting - great to watch the mountains from their wonderful deck. We had a guided hike to top of Baldy with a great guide, thank you Aries! The view from our room knocked my breath out! I wish I knew about this place when we traveled in this area a few years earlier. It is a rustic, authentic and warm haven in one of the most incredible places on earth. Clean sheets, great food, s'mores by the fire and guided hikes. A great memory!</text><pics>None< /pics>< user>

<review>While pricey, it is in the heart of the park, so it is convenient to the location. The price also includes a delicious buffet dinner and breakfast and amenities like a trampoline, ping pong, and lake activities. The location is beautiful with a spectacular view of snowcapped mountains. While the lodge is an older building, it is well maintained and the rooms were clean and comfortable (without phones or TV's but we didn't miss them). Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful.

<text>Great location inside Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. The lodge is on a small, pretty lake and in the warm summer (July 2017) they had kayaks, paddle boards, and tiny sailboats to use. There is a pool, volleyball, lots of older teenage camp workers, and a buffet restaurant, as well as a small bar. The surrounding area is beautiful. The big sequoia trees are 30 mins to 45 mins drive north or south in the park.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80955d83d7564403:0x18b3053cbdf85e46<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>The All Inclusive Resort is located in a beautiful area of Sequoia with a small lake. The staff are extremely friendly, the buffet styleels are awesome, healthy, and delicious. It is a multi national place to mingle with people from different countries, e joy a Smore next to camp fire at night, row in the lake or sit in mountain front porch and enjoy the view of mountains. Excellent place and hard to book. Highly recommended.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Montecito Sequoia Lodge is a great destination for families to spend time together and have fun participating in the camp's wide array of activities. The buffet style 3 meals a day offer variety and excellent taste. All the camp's employees and counselors are friendly and helpful. The location is stunningly beautiful, and it would be easy to spend months here enjoying the views. It is within short driving distance to many of Sequoia National Park's iconic destinations and hiking trails. My only gripe with the camp is the wireless network is not very well set up, and the placment of repeater routers seems arbitrary. But not having easy access to the internet seems to be somewhat of a blessing, you don't become distracted by social media and electronics, so you can better enjoy the wilderness. That being said, if you run a business like me, and need to respond to emails, the far corner of the lodge seems to have the best connection. All in all, Montecito Sequoia Lodge is one of my favorite destinations in the United States, and I am proud to have made many wonderful memories with family and friends here.</review>< date>

Staff was exceptionally friendly, food was great, location is unbeatable, and the rooms are spacious with private bathrooms. They will go above and beyond for example they even pack trail lunches so you could go hiking and still have food for lunch.< /Review>

<Text>Meals all included, and coffee/juice available 24/7, common area spacious and homey. Great experience, especially seems good for families with kids. No tv and wifi spotty. Walls are thin so can be noisy, and parking was sparse mostly due to snow. Packed lunch available if staying for the night. Would come back again!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

Very nice place inside the Kings Canyon National Park, perfect to visit it and the Sequoia National Park. Calm, on the border of Montecito Lake, they also propose lots of activities and food is included. The room did not have air conditioning but that wasn't a problem for us, even at the end May.<//review>

<text>I spent 2 nights here with my family. The place is fantastic: it's located right inside the Sequoia National Park, not far from some of the nicest spots. The room (cabin #21) was nice, with two bunk beds made of wood and a queen bed, plus it has a view on the lake.
The place has a lot of amenities: the fire in the evening, the lake with free canoes and a small slide in the middle, a trampoline for younger kids, several ping-pong tables, a foosball table, entertainment in the night after dinner and activities for the kids (we did not use these).
Meals are included: quality is ok, but can vary. Overall, very simple set up, which is great thinking that you are in a national park, but can be disappointing if you expect hotel-quality.
We had a shared bathroom: nicer than average camp site, but not great: considering the price, I think they could be improved.
Staff is nice and kind, even if not so prepared to give directions (we are inside the park...)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Employees are friendly but the hotel itself isn't the cleanest. The bed and pillow covers were a little dirty when I stayed. The included food is okay but other guests made a big mess<//review>

This place has an old and cozy atmosphere. Good to bring kids and disconnect the world.  The Wi-Fi and cellphone wireless network don't work there. And there's no tv in the bedrooms as well! Take another place if you are a very Internet and tv person. For me,  the food didn't pay the price. But the all place payed for it self.  Stunning nature surrounding!< /review>

GREAT FOR FAMILIES!!!   Montecito is a family friendly lodge/camp with both rustic and modern cabins available. Located on a small lake on National Forest Service Land with lots of trees, mountain views from the lodge and access to the Big Baldy trail, You don't have to drive anywhere! Tons of things for kids to do. Reasonable rates which included 3 hearty homemade meals a day.  Friendly staff!  Great Vibes!!  Strategically located between Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, you are within a short drive to both Grant's Grove and The General Sherman's Tree and at 7,400 ft you are up out of the heat!< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Although price is a little high, it is reasonable considering the round trip time to the hotel outside the park. The atmosphere was good and the dinner and breakfast were delicious. The rooms are compact but well kept and the amenities are satisfactory. I want to stay again.

<Text>(Translated by Google) The rooms are really dated. For the half board attention the meal finished very early and the hotel does not communicate the schedules end at 19h (it is necessary to think of asked whereas a service until 21h seems logical for a tourist place). The hotel has nice outdoor space and the view is really nice.

Les chambres sont vraiment vieillottes.

The bad, very weak wi-fi in the rooms, no reception, reasonable level rooms down and down, you hear everything as if the walls are made of cardboard, you hear the people walking in the hallway and the water tap opens in the rooms next door, breakfast is very poor and the dishes are dirty.

Le site laissait rêveur, au milieu de la forêt et au bord dun lac. Désillusion totale! Le cottage en piteux état (plafond pourri par endroit, avec des trous), les lits et oreillers inconfortables, la couverture trop fine, si bien que nous avons eu très froid, les prises sont inaccessibles, la décoration dun autre temps Il sagit plus dune cabane que dun cottage.  Nous sommes arrivés à 20h, laccueil est peu aimable. Le repas était servi à 19h! Donc plus rien. Après réclamation, on nous a dit de nous servir dans les restes au frigo. La vue de la cuisine coupe lappétit (cuisinière sale, sol couvert de débris, grille pains immonde..) les couverts sont sales. Tout le monde mange dans la grande salle commune où tous les repas sont pris. La piscine est sale. Lambiance fait penser à une colonie de vacances pour adultes tenue par des adolescents. Difficile dimaginer que lon puisse passer des vacances à cet endroit!! Et tout çà pour la modique somme de 390 USD dont 41,95 USD de frais de service! Nous avons payé moins cher pour un magnifique cottage à Yosemite.Une seule hâte au réveil, partir! Cest un cauchemar! Si vous avez le choix, vous savez ce quil vous reste à faire.< /text>

(Translated by Google) It is a campsite with these chalets equipped with a wood-burning and electric stove ... without a bathroom that is shared in other facilities just a few meters away where there is everything to spend a nice experience in the park. We arrived late and they gave us pre-cooked food to heat in the microwaves. All very beautiful. On the negative side, the girl at the reception (with colored hair) who, despite seeing that we were tourists, made no effort to be better understood. It was the only bit of a bona fide to tell the truth.

(Original)
È un campeggio con questi chalet dotati di stufa a legna ed elettrica...senza bagno che è in comune in altre strutture a pochi metri dove c'è tutto per passare una bella esperienza nel parco. Siamo arrivati tardi e ci hanno dato del cibo precotto da scaldare nei microonde. Tutto molto bello. Di negativo la ragazza alla reception (con capelli colorati) che pur vedendo che eravamo turisti non ha fatto nessuno sforzo per farsi capire meglio. È stata l'unica un po cafona a dire il vero.</text>

(Translated by Google) Fantastic location and surroundings, food at very limited times and not very varied (not at all my taste). Duvets could be cleaner.

(Original)
Traumhafte Lage und Umgebung, Essen zu sehr eingeschränkten Zeiten und auch nicht sehr vielfältig (überhaupt nicht mein Geschmack). Bettdecken könnten sauberer sein.<//Text>

Einfache, komfortable und fast schön luxuriöse Hütten und Häuser mitten im Wald, ein spannendes Erlebnis. Die Verpflegung ist lecker und für Wanderausflüge gibt es tolle Lunchpakete mit auf den Weg. Ähnlich einer Berghütte steht zudem die Küche die ganze Nacht zur Verfügung und man kann sich stets kostenlos verpflegen. Für Kinder gibt es sehr viel Angebote zum Zeitvertreib und für Erwachsene gibt es viel Natur. Die Montesito-Lodge ist eine klare Empfehlung für einen oder mehrere Nächte.Allerdings: Alles in allem ist die Lodge zu teuer. Geboten wird eine Camporganisation im Stil einer Jugendherberge (im positiven Sinn). Es ist kein Hotelbetrieb, d.h. es gibt bspw. auch keinen, der das Zimmer zwischendurch reinigt und ggf. die Handtücher tauscht. Wenn das kleine Fläschchen Shampoo leer ist, dann ist es leer. Wenn die eine Portion Kaffeepulver verbraucht ist, gibt es keinen Kaffee mehr. Dies ist für den enormen Preis, trotz der Lage, dann doch deutlich zu wenig Service. Zumal es sehr auffällig ist, dass an vielen Stellen in den Gebäuden und innerhalb der Außenanlage die Liebe zum Detail bereits vor langer Zeit verloren gegangen ist.< /review>

<Review>Leider waren wir nur eine Nacht dort. Großartige Ferienanlage mit vielen Möglichkeiten zur Freizeitgestaltung besonders für Familien. Vollpension vom Feinsten. Pool, See und ein unendlich toller Ausblick. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Blick auf den See. Allein die Zimmerdecke könnte erneuert werden. Sonst war alles super!<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>Im Herzen des Nationalparks liegt dieses Hotel mitten in der Natur, es ist ruhig und rustikal. Man wird bestens verplegt, das Buffet war sowohl zum Abendessen als auch zum Frühstück umfangreich und sehr lecker! Getränke sind vielfältig vorhanden und man kann sich bedienen wann immer man möchte. Es war genau das Richtige um sich nach einem langen Tag im Park zu stärken.Abends am Kamin sitzen war ebenfalls sehr angenehm. Erwähnenswert ist vielleicht, dass es keinen TV im Zimmer gibt und dass die Wlan-Verbindung nicht allzu gut funktioniert.Aber wir können dieses Hotel nur empfehlen!<//review>< Pictures>

<username>Expedia reviewer<//username><Time>1475798400000</Time><rating>None<//rating><Text>Vi körde bil från Los Angeles till Sequoia-parken, för att sedan köra vidare till San Francisco dagen därpå vilket innebar att vi behövde någonstans att övernatta medan vi var i parken. Efter att vi hade betalat inträdet i Sequoia-parken körde vi längs med 198:an hela vägen och gjorde stopp där vi tyckte det kändes lämpligt. Vi besökte Crystal Cave, vilket kändes som en slingrig väg till världens ände, men upplevelsen var helt klart värt avstickaren från 198:an. Dessutom finns det gigantiska träd i parken! ;)Är man inte rädd för höjder eller om man inte har något emot lite ansträngning, rekommenderar jag verkligen att ta sig upp på Moro Rock. Utsikten är helt fantastisk!En natt på Montecito Sequoia Lodge var välbehövligt, för parken är stor! Vi kom dit ganska sent, men som tur väl var middagsbuffén framdukat till 19:30, så vi hann få mat med oss. Tips: Ska ni köra genom Sequoia, glöm inte matsäck som vi gjorde. Det finns verkligen ingenstans att få tag i mat.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Hier hat es uns sehr gefallen! Wir kamen uns vor wie einem Sommerlager. Am Abend Lagerfeuer und Musik. Grosser See mit Pedalo, Boote etc. War sehr gemütlich und entspannend. Essen war inklusive und hat geschmeckt. Zimmer waren zweckmässig. Luxus gibt es nicht, dafür Ruhe, Romantik und freundliche Leute. Würden wir wieder buchen.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Total disappointment, the hotel warned us only 7 hours before we arrived that we needed chains to the car because of the snow, we had a rental car and no chain ... On the honeymoon the hotel n wanted nothing know and we did not have the opportunity to cancel ... In short if the hotel had warned 24 hours before we would have been refunded .... Really not nice it partly spoiled our honeymoon and we had to take another room in another place ...

(Original)
Déception totale, l hôtel nous a prévenu seulement 7h avant d arriver qu il fallait des chaînes à la voiture à cause de la neige, nous avions une voiture de location et pas de chaîne... En voyage de noces l hôtel n à rien voulu savoir et nous n avons pas eu la possibilité d annuler... Bref si l hôtel avait prévenu 24h avant nous aurions été remboursé.... Vraiment pas sympa cela a gâché en partie notre lune de miel et nous avons du prendre une autres chambre dans un autre lieu...< /text>

(Translated by Google) An aged accommodation! Nice location and for American standards good food (all meals included!) Distinguishes this lodge. Unfortunately, the rooms a bit worn, corridors down and Aussenalnagen not very well maintained. The price is just not adequate, but as an accommodation in the national park ok.

Stora salar, ok rum, otroligt trevlig och hjälpsam personal (tipsade om vad man skulle se och inte bara om det som turist kartan sa). Stor buffé som ingick (enkel men god och passande). Hela hotellet känns så natur och vandring och man fick sådan lust att vandra (synd vi bara bodde där 1 natt). Förvänta er inget lyx hotell, utan ett lyx vandrarhem. Rekommenderar detta varmt för den som vill uppleva naturen!<//text>

Familienfreundliche Lodge in schöner Lage, kommunikationsfördernder Gemeinschafts/Speiseraum mit offenen Kaminen, ganztägig gutes Essen am Buffet, für Wanderungen über den Mittag gibt es auf Wunsch Lunchpakete. Das Haus und die Zimmer sind zwar schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber für eine Lodge ganz ok. Außenpool und Whirlpool waren auch bei Minus-Temperaturen beheizt.</review>

<Review>Die Jugenherberge liegt einsam im Wald, Hotel kann man die Unterkunft beim besten Willen nicht nennen.Der untere Bereich des größten Gebäudes ist Empfang, Speisesaal, Spielzimmer für Kinder und Aufenthaltsraum in einem. Alle Zimmer liegen einen Stock höher. Die Zimmerausstattung ein Stockbett,Doppelbett und Komode.Auch ein Badezimmer war vorhanden. SpartanischWie verdreckt der Teppichboden war, konnten wir bei dem wenigen Licht nicht sehen.Warum diese Lodge 4 Sterne hat, ist mir unverständlich.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Room without tv or air conditioning. In my case overlooking the trash cans (like all the cjambres at the back of the main building)
Only good note the geographical position and in pretty little lake. GOING THROUGH THAT BY OBLIGATION. This is certainly not a 3 star hotel. He deserves not even a ..

< review>
We brought in our 1986 Toyota RV for a smog and emissions test. The RV failed twice but Lathrop Smog did not fail us. They were quick and efficient with testing and helped us to diagnose what issues we were encountering. Once we fixed the issues, we were able to get in at short notice and passed the test with flying colors. They went above and beyond to help us and we are grateful for their generosity. We would highly recommend them in you are in the area.</review>

<text>These guys took forever to get to me. I told them I needed to be in and out otherwise I'll take my business elsewhere. They sent me on a trip to store to get a part which they said was cheap, it was expensive af. Untrustworthy from the start talking about a part almost $200 is cheap. These guys held me up all day and now I have to stay in state for another day to go-to the dmv since they sold me bs word that this would be quick. F these guys take your business elsewhere if u need a job done in a matter of time</text>< pics>

I have to say that Nirmal did a fabulous job. I had full face and neck threading 🧵 (yeah, don’t judge), and she was one of the Most gentlest threaders I’ve been too. She did an amazing job. Highly recommend. Very easy to find within the mall.</text>

I came here and visited Nirmal, she did my brows and did amazing. Didn’t really think my brows could look that good but she did her thing and shaped them up so nicely. Would highly recommended requesting her!! Super nice, made me feel really comfortable and my experience was 10/10<//review>

Best place in Santa Rosa if you are in need for brow threading this place has everything you could ask for in a brow bar. I've been visiting brow arc for about a year now and always get amazing results.I recommend you ask for kripa she's the sweetest and knows exactly how to fix your brows to your fit. 10/10</text>

<text>I had a terrible personal experience with doing my own eyebrows, making the idea of doing my own become scary. I find it hard to trust another individual to work on anything on my face, but today’s experience with Nirmal has changed my mind. I came in and was kindly greeted and immediately sat down to begin. Nirmal listened to my specific requests to even out my eyebrows but keep them thick as I like. She was very kind throughout the entire experience and I will definitely be returning!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

Friendly staff, I did not have to wait long and was directed to the next step from the moment I walked in. Also informed of times and what to expect. Inside the lab every staff member was really clean and they all followed the same steps and showed me the process of all. No room for mix ups. AMAZING< /review>

The clinic was very nice, staff greeted me very helpful. Clinic very clean in compliance with Covid restrictions, rooms clean and overall the doctor was very nice and easy to talk to.  If I ask a question she answered without any problem. Very good staff and the ambiance was nice.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I had a terrible experience with the front staff. I called before I headed over and was told there would be a minimal wait as there were no patients waiting. When I arrived the staff told me I would have to wait an hour since the doctor left for lunch. Did they not plan for or know when the doctor was going for lunch? Why didn't they tell me? So I waited to be seen and they missed their quoted time anyways. So I had to leave and they wasted my afternoon. If they couldn't see patients then they should just say so.

I put this blame on their office manager/front staff. I'd recommend going elsewhere.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<rating>1< /rating><review>I went to get a required physical before I could start at my new job, that was supposed to take less than an hour. I ended up being in there for FIVE. HOURS. I went the previous day but it was too close to closing and so they told me to come back at around 1 the next day. I got there at 12:30 to be safe. Apparently the ONLY doctor they had was on a late lunch break and left at 1 instead of 12, so the lady told me she would be back at 2. Doctor didn’t come back until 3. So I didn’t even start the process until I had already waited for 2.5 hours. Once I finally got in, the nurses messed up my paperwork and had to reprint EVERYTHING, which took up more time. Once we finally started, the nurse I was with could tell I was visibly annoyed from waiting 3 hours so far for a 40 minute physical, and yet was still joking around and telling jokes acting like nothing was wrong. Read the room. Once we got through hearing and visual tests and stuff, she admitted that she literally DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO DO ONE OF THE REQUIRED TESTS and had to find someone else to do it. She ended up doing it herself, which resulted in me sitting there for 30 minutes while she figured out and guessed on how to put the equipment together and then failed to conduct a proper breathing test 8 times in a row. At this point it had been 4 hours. Waited another 40 minutes for a doctors consultation at the end, which consisted of the doctor just repeating “I’m sorry” every 2 seconds instead of conducting the exam. If she would just stop spouting meaningless apologies and do the test, I would have gotten out probably 10 minutes earlier. Total time for a supposed-to-be 40 minute physical at the end of the day was 5 hours and some additional minutes. Worst place I have ever been to, I’d rather walk on hot coals than come back. If you have literally any other option, take it. I usually never post reviews but this was horrific.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Excellent, and efficient drug test and although they had plenty of people testing they finished everyone in a very timely manner. The reception nurses didn't have nasty attitudes like so many do. I wish this was my Doctors office really. It's, sad. But, I'm glad I had this experience at Consentra for work. They, are AWESOME!😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇<//text>< rate>

I had a very nice experience at this clinic. The concentra clinic I visited was the one in el segundo. I went for a pre-employment job physical but they were so nice. Everyone was polite and just very friendly. Thank you so much for such an awesome experience at your office.<//Review>

The reception personnel and nurse Rachael were very professional and courteous. But I went in for a DOT physical for a job, but the doctor only would give a 90 day certificate because she wanted me to get a sleep apnea study. What difference is there if she would have given me a year one, if it’s so bad wouldn’t something happen to me in the next 90 days? I know, I need to lose weight and I’m working on that but the difference here for me is that 90 day certificate didn’t help me at all. Thanks to this doctor I continue to be unemployed and no possibility of health insurance because.< /text>

<review>Staff not attentive and welcoming as people walk into the office. Staff at the desk seemed unprofessional, and unorganized, my papers scattered all over the desk, they seemed like they were not prepared and in a rush, staff kept mentioning “sorry, it’s almost time for lunch break, the next girl will finish your stuff.” I ended up filling out double the paperwork because they were unorganized and did not know exactly what was needed (although I walked in with all paperwork in-hand and ready to go from my employer.)
When getting a urine test and eye exam, staff did not explain what to do, what to expect next; it did not seem like a smooth or professional process.
I was given a TB shot, the nurse drew it up wrong (I am a nurse and watched), she injected air under my skin and was nervous and surprised but did not correct herself, she blew it off. I am now needing to go back for a new TB test.
During physical exam, I waited 45min to be seen by the doctor. Once she arrived, she immediately took a personal phone call INSIDE my room for about 10 minutes. This was extremely unprofessional and rude seeing as I had been in the office over two hours for simple, routine work.
I wouldn’t go here if I had the choice! Awful and SO SLOW, very unprofessional!!</review>< Resp>

Always put on hold when first calling. Secondly they take forever to get test results back and use the excuse that there just a third party and blame it on the lab people there’s something that needs to be done we shouldn’t have to wait 5 or more days for test results most of us live with family members you guys make it 100 times harder for us at home. Other places are same day results. You guys need to get it together or start from the manager down and replace with people who care for your health not just a pay check.</review>

I needed to be tested for the COVID 19. For work.
Everyone is very gracious and patient.
Easy parking and easy to get to in the middle of the complex; just off the closed food shack
They know their business
I recommend them in a heartbeat 💗 💗💗

I came in for medical attention because of a cut on my forehead, while I was at work.
It was good my associate at work helped me apply first aid to my bleeding cut.
When I arrived at Concentra office I had to wait for awhile because of the load they had that time.
Juanita, the receiving nurse clerk was kind enough to help orient me with their procedures. I was even offered coffee.
The examination process went well. The attending nurse, Gardenia, and attending physician, Paul, did an excellent job.
I was told to come back the next day since it was a head injury, and I did. I was given excellent service.
My final appointment with Concentra was a week after, and I was released from their care.< /text>

I went in to make an appointment for a Physical Ability Test, required by my prospective employer.

The facility was clean with polite staff. I received some paperwork that had clear instructions, which closely resembled my appointment experience.

Once i was called in for the (same day) appointment, the therapist was polite and gave clear instructions and examples. After the therapist cleared me to leave, a staff member at the front desk validated my parking, which covered my stay at the facility.

(Parking validation gave me 2 hours free parking, i think that there is a charge for every 15 min after that.)< /Text>

I was sent by my employer here to deal with a stress-related incident. I was reluctant to come at first, after hearing experiences from my friends and family regarding industrial clinics. But boy when I saw Dr. Lee, I was just so pleasantly surprised. She is just the opposite of how you would imagine a doctor should look like, young, vibrant, attractive. But most importantly, she was so patient and showed so much compassion that my stress level came down tremendously right away. Ever since then I had requested to be seen by her every time. Maria was also extremely patient and had a great sense of humor which caused me to laugh every time. The staff at the reception and the staff who took me to the rooms were also all extremely attentive and had great attitudes. Overall, I am grateful that I was sent here to be treated. What's more, they validate parking which is awesome!<//Text>

unfortunately there wasn't a lot of people 4 workers had call out so that meant a huge wait and the ones working were not that happy to see me besides the lady at the counter everyone else had this angry face and manner,  while I was waiting for the Doctor, (close to an hour) I can hear everyone having a good time talking to each other i was hungry tired and in pain but they bother to offer at least a cup of water or ones in a while let me know how long was going to take? nope! I guess they just not care at all when a worker injured themself by the time I got out of there I couldn't even go to the pharmacie it was close to 6pm which is the time they close other ways I might had to stay longer< /Review>

< review>
The people were nice, but it was very inefficient. I was the only person in the waiting room and it took a half hour before I was called in. Then it was another 20 min before the PA came in. She spoke to me for a while, but then made another appointment for me to come back in 2 days to see someone else. I was there for 1 hour and 40 min.

Appointment 2– waited for 30 minutes in the lobby. A different PA comes in and says that I don’t need an x-ray and the only thing they can do is take a blood test. Then I waited a full hour while they figured out what color vial to use for the blood test. The doctor came in after 30 minutes and apologized, but it still took 30 more minutes. Total appointment time— 2 hours.

I have to go back this week for the results. I’m going to take a book.</review>

They are super slow. Not enough personnel. Be ready to spend here 2-3 hrs for a simple appointment. Also, they are super slow on their phone line. I'm sure everyone has other things to worry about on a daily basis the last thing they need is stressing over these people. Definitely should look else where!<//Review>

This is really more a review of Dr. Seema Sharma.  I stopped in just as Concentra Urgent Care was closing after a bad bike accident. Dr. Sharma was able to accurately diagnose my shoulder injury without an X-Ray and she has a caring, holistic, and reassuring manner.  She took the time to talk to me and though it took a long time to recover, I felt much better after seeing her.</Text>

<Text>I have been here for work related problem and have to say the continuity of care is the worst I have ever experienced. Staff are very nice but it's very clear the lack of training. Which can get frustrating for all.
During the onset of my injury, when I was in the worst pain I was seen by 3 different urgent care staff doctors during the first 2 months of care, before being referred to specialty orthopedics for proper treatment plan. On more then one occasion I had the staff correct my status report because it referred to a completely different body part. Yes, I was in for right upper extremities and Doctor referred to left...he even came in and said once, "how is your knee"...
Now here is wear it gets worse, specialty doctors are only available one day a week, every two weeks. So even when you get appointment you wait an hour to be seen.
It frustrating to wait a month for an appointment, then an hour late for all but was 2 minutes of the doctors time to tell you to come back in a month. Really....
Therapy staff with the exception of the initial consultation person lacked personality and manners. Everyone is buried in there phones and very little eye contact with patients.
Administrator at this facility needs to take a closer look at the continuity of care.
Stop making your staff look like a joke.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This was the absolute worst and scariest experiences ever! After waiting for over an hour to be seen- Dr. Pedram Kohan came in to assist me. I proceeded to tell him what I had came in for but I could tell he wasn’t listening based on his demeanor. He never asked questions, just kept saying ‘uh-huh’ . He then proceeds to tell me about some topical and Naproxen- I then say to him ‘do you think this headache has anything with my pressure?’ . He looks at the chart and immediately freaks out and says ‘Oh my god- I didn’t even look at your chart and the medication I prescribed would raise your pressure- you need to go to Emergency’ and begins to end the visit. My issue is HOW ARE YOU PRESCRIBING MEDS WITHOUT REVIEWING MY CHART! With a BP of 184/122 had I taken the Naproxen, I could have had a stroke! I thought doctors took oaths to save lives- but how can u save one without checking basic vitals like blood pressure! This is a disgrace and completely unacceptable.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I agree with other 1 star reviews. I had an urgent issue and called ahead to see how long the wait was. Juanita at the front office said she didn't know. She was literally in the front office and in-taking patients and didn't know how long she was making folks wait. That was the first red flag. When I arrived, I told her that I called to make sure that my insurance covered me should I get services there (as their website suggests). As I was telling Juanita that I called and had to pay co-pay, she gave me attitude, cut me off, dismissed whatever I was saying as if I was automatically wrong, and said she would still call. I understand the need to verify accurate insurance, but why tell patients to call ahead, do a little double-checking, and then treat them like they're idiots? About 30 minutes later she called me up and said she needed to collect my co-pay, to which I said, "so I was right?" And she pretended not to hear me. I told her, that I'm sick and I'm coming here for help and that all she needed to say was, "Thank you for checking ahead of time, I'll also check to make sure you don't get billed incorrectly." She said that she never gave attitude. Hah.
TLDR: Don't go here even if it is more convenient geographically. I'd rather take the bus or lyft to a different location.<//review>

Unbelievably rude staff. Non exsistent customer service. Condescending with a total lack of compassion . Took a friend there  from out of state who was suffering from an ear infection..... healthworks was pre authorized by provider. She had her card number and picture id. According to provider and the other Healtheorks clinic we went to this should more than suffice to render care. However the 2 ladys doing intake at this clinic decided it was not and refused to treat her. They were  horrible disregarding anything she said, they made no attempt to problem solve, suggest, refer or offer any resources to assist her. A total non exsistent effort from staff who did not want to do their job. Luckily she was able to contact a neighboring Healthworks clinic who said that is not how they do business and for her to go there. I wish we would have read the reviews prior. Obviously management has failed to make some serious corrective measures resulting in the negligent retention of incompetence.
Your in the healthcare industry yet have no concept of what it meams to care< /text>

I've tried so hard to work with this place. After getting an injury, I feel like I've been in complete hell for the 2+ years I've been with this healthworks place. Two times they accidentally released me when they shouldn't have, times where I had to wait 4 hours to see the doctors, wait after wait of being told I needed to get certain things done but never happening, and not providing me the right papers for me to get blood drawn at another place because they can't do it themselves. Not only that but they had troubles finding MRIs that I had done in the past and couldn't find information from the Gardenas Healthworks they sent me to even though they said it should be there. I tried. I try so hard to be positive about this but this is torture. And the fact that I'm still not good for my work and that I am struggling already doesn't help. I'm sure there are those who have not gone through what I'm going through and for that I envy you and hope you never have to. All I ask is that you don't do this to other people.< /Text>

They don't even deserve one star. I was here for pre emloyment physical exam and blood test. My company sent me here so I had no choice.  I waited for 3hours to get checked. After urine and TB test, I was told to wait again to see a doctor and it took them longer than 40min to call me. I got there at 1pm and it is 5:16pm right now and I am still here, waiting for a doctor. It is just ridiculous.< /review>

It’s ridiculous the amount of time you wait at this office. Last time I waited four hours to get a TB test which takes three minutes to perform.<//Text>

Waited an hour and a half for a test that takes 5 minutes, only to find out they all went on their lunch breaks. We don’t know how long we will be here, but we were told they should have been back a while ago. Super unprofessional when we were the only people waiting.<//Review>

TL;DR Keto friendly. Keto Unbun available. Great, customizable burgers.
Reasonable prices
Choice of meats: beef, Angus beef, chicken, salmon, lamb.
Falafel and B4 Burger also offered.
Friendly, homestyle courtesy and service.
Parking lot can be tight. Free street parking avaliable.
AWESOME BURGER PLACE
If you look at the menu online just know that you're probably going to be seeing the Grubhub menu and each item is marked up in price on that menu.
The burgers are totally reasonably priced on the Burger IM actual menu. I think the most expensive is $7.99. They do charge additional for premium additions like bacon, avocado, sauteed mushrooms, and the like.
This is just a straight-up, no nonsense, honest burger. The focus is on delivering top quality quality ingredients cooked perfection. It is  not that extreme, over-the-top burger with truffles and buns made of waffles kind of thing.
The regular burgers are either 1/3 pound or 1/4 pound. They also have 3 oz sliders if you wanna try a few different burgers or just have a snack to get you through that 4 PM hunger pang before dinner.
My group had 8 different burgers, including the lamb and grilled chicken, and everyone was happy with their selection.
We will definitely return again and again.<//Text>

< Review>
I ordered online two chicken burgers and one order of fries with cheese & Jalapeno . One order of onion rings, one 6 piece chicken wings. Everything I ordered was perfectly made.their cheesy fries was to die for.I was able to add comments to  say what I did or did not want on my burgers.  I ordered at 11:05am and my food was ready for pickup at 11:24!!!! Great job!! Thank you guys!!! We will definitely eat here again. The workers were friendly and wearing gloves.< /Review>

Absolutely amazing burgers wings and vibes. It's fine restaurant quality food with the cozy and cool vibes of a small street side Cafe. The prices are definitely not cheap like McDonald's or burger king but %100 adequate for the food they're serving. I eat there once a week because of how great it is Amazing food I highly recommend.</text>

I'm always on the look out for a new veggie burger. My friend took me here and I got the trio slider burgers. I got them all with the vg patty. Dude just a heads up they charge a dollar Extra to swap patties. PER SLIDER. I'm so over everyplace CHARGING EXTRA to go vegan/vegetarian. It's not cool. Am I paying 9.99 for just the bun mayo and pickles? I really hope this stops. The burgers are good and the fries are pretty good. I don't understand the whole fries and drink 2.99 extra and just the fries (I don't drink soda) is 2.99. I like this place as a t.y.s spot, the price isn't something I can do weekly. Give out coupons or something. They also take a min to bring out the food. Ok whew. Sorry it is good just a few things that personally come to my mind. Good buffalo sauce. #fillthefries #noextrachargeforranch #rollingwithlydia< /text>

This place is really nice

When I saw a burgerim open up in my area, I was really excited and I couldn’t wait for the grand opening. The place opened, and I’ve been going to this restaurant for a while and had great service! I came here with a family of 4 and we had a long complicated order, and they got it all right. And the cheese fries they gave was amazing, definitely going to come here every week. However, the order did take long, and I understand that my order was a big one.

But all and all, I think this is a great place and they give out my orders, no matter how complicated I make them.<//Text>

Great tasting burgers and good quality food. I like their twist on the fries that gives you something different then your typical fry but still giving you a fry. They have a really good vegetarian option if that is what you want and they also have a lamb burger option that is also very good. Can't go wrong here<//Text>

Ordered a burger, asked for a cup for water.  "Oh we don't have cups for water".. just bottles.  You know what, I may be petty for the review, but it's more petty to not have "water cups".  I'm like.. what about those?  "We don't use those" 😂  The burger was not the quality I'm used to either.  Bun was dry and there wasn't enough dressing which exasperated the dryness.  I asked for well done and it was very pink.  This burgerim experience was by far the worse.  So yea.  Dry medium well burger w a dry bun and no water. Horrible.  I guess this location doing bad.  Lord help my stomach tonight.  I might have made an error here today.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkP6HbW9z-qfS5d4GgFud54TgZNLxQkaRaJZ_B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

First thing's first, they have a really bad lighting problem, if you have epilepsy or suffer from migranes, the lighting in most of the restaurant will probably trigger a seizure or nasusea. My dad and I ended up sitting at the counter where the lights were normal.
I was really excited to check this place out when I found out it was opening up in our neighborhood, I look forward to a good hamburger. Finally got to checking it out today. The girl who took our order was very nice, took a bit long on taking our order, but in all fairness my dad's order was very particular (and they did get it right so points for that).

It felt like it took a really long time for our order to come out. We did like our food. It's was good but not great like I expected. I feel like if you're a decent cook, you could've made the same burger at home.

Also we ended up sitting fairly close to the kitchen so we so how the staff was and no one seemed very happy to be there. The one girl in the front was trying, and would go check to see if she could help anyone with anything. I wish I would've gotten her name because her effort was probably the best part of this place.

All and all they need some work, definitely need their lights fixed ASAP. If you want to eat a burger and don't want to cook at home, then check this place out.< /Text>

<review>I love the potato ship shape french fries LOL but I had to have the Spanish beef which has pepper jack cheese and habanero grilled jalapeños on it!!

It didn’t take even 10 minutes for me to get ordered and received my food I love sitting down the environment is really pleasant and very clean. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and I really like to here.

If you’re ready to get a big one I recommend the family box or the party box it’s really cool it’s an awesome sharing option!!</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Service was great and burger was good but not great. I had a grass fed beef burger, onion rings and soda. I just didn't feel it was missing something. I prefer charbroiled. I still may try other items on the menu such as the felafel burger.</Review>

No photos bc I ate the food too fast. But this restaurant has shake shack and in n out beat. The burgers were beautifully cooked that I devoured them in seconds. The fries with garlic and Parmesan rank among the best I’ve ever had. No complaints seriously this place is soooooo good.< /Text>

<Text>Horrible....I placed order on line, confirmation sent that order would be ready  @11:55, arrived and told they were working on my order, finally at 12:20 mt order was ready, I told them I was 2 orders of fries, they had one and said that they would need to make another, I left without the fries and the fries that I did get were cold.    Also, ordered without onions and there were onions on my burger.  First time going...Never again!<//Text>< time>

<text>Place is meeh, it's nice, ppl working there are nice but mmmmeeeeehhhhhh little expensive for what you get. But the order is done right, the food comes out well cooked, burgers are juicy, fires are crisp, and the tables are clean. But I would not go out of my way for theses burgers the same as I would for five guys or in and out. But over all yah foods good<//text>< Response>

Beautiful park! Nice picnic area, and flat sidewalks where kids can ride bikes. Has a bathroom. Only downsides  Are the little creek/pond is kinda gross and the grass around it is really wet. Also the dog park is great for the dogs, but some of the dogs seem aggressive, which is not so great when your there with your kiddos or smaller dogs.</Review>

One of the best parks for dogs in Santa Rosa that I know of is here. They have a water feature which looks nicer when it's raining. Great place for a picnic. Located by a library which is nice too. Good for a walk, good to take the kids, play baseball, throw a football or baseball, play tag, etc. Great place to relax. Some nice looking trees too.<//text>

<Review>This is a great park. Plenty of room for multiple events at the same time, lots of space to run and play, many trees providing shade for those hot days, easy access to modern, well-maintained bathrooms. Only thing that could have made it better would be a pool< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

There’s always a lovely breeze, lots of shade on hot sunny days, the bathrooms are generally well maintained, and there’s ample seating. Sometimes on weekends there are even awesome food trucks that come by! I love this park. 😊< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

< Review>
When owners bring food, they don't pay attention to their dogs. One big dog grabbed my chuck it and I told him "no!" And "leave it!" None of the owners lifted a finger. The dog bit me but not hard enough to break the skin. It wasn't until I screamed hey that anyone noticed.< /Review>

<text>Great place to walk the dog, relax, talk to friends on the phone, or just enjoy the scenery. Nice big trees, sprawling grassy lawns, picnic tables, benches, a dog park, a play area for little ones. Enjoy!</text>< username>

We go to this park often because it's not crowded like other parks. It's huge and lots of running space for kids. The play area for kids is well maintained and very nice.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I found this park when my oldest daughter was about 1 year 1/2, it has been such a haven for us. Bring a picnic lunch and spread out a blanket. Great shade during hot days. The structures are great for toddlers and young kids. Plenty of sand to build castles in. My girls are 4 and 6 now, we live closer to howarth park and that park is great for what it is but this is by far our favorite. Also love that we can do our library activites and go straight to the park afterwards.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The first time we came here, it was nice. Our dogs got along great with the small dogs that were present. The next time, a small dog owner informed us that 1:00pm is informally the time for ONLY toy breeds. This is a public park. Nothing is posted about certain times being reserved for a certain size or breed of dog. When our youngest wanted to play with hers, she told us to keep ours away from hers as if she owned the place. Excuse me, we all pay taxes here and Santa Rosa is a city in Sonoma County inhabited by more than 1 individual. Then a large un-neutered Yellow Labrador showed up and incessantly pestered and tried to mount our girls. The owner could have cared less. He said the dog wouldn't do anything. Well he was already doing something because he was un-neutered and out of control. People are very clickish here. Also, beware of un-neutered males with owners who have no comprehension of the problems an un-neutered male can havock at a public dog park.< /Review>

<text>SO good!!!! Me and my husband both got wet burritos, we got my toddler son a regular bean and cheese burrito with a side of fries, he's a very picky eater but WOW he loved that burrito!! The salsa bar was GREAT, wowee that avocado salsa is yummy!! The woman behind the counter let me taste the pineapple drink they sell there before buying and I appreciated that! Thanks for the wonderful food and service guys!!!< /text>< pictures>

The chile verde wet burrito was great! The building was on warm side and the tamale was pretty bad. But I'd definitely go back for chile verde again.< /review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>Not from the town, so tried to see what had some  high reviews. Ordered 2 tacos, the flautas plate, menudo. Not sure what is suppose to be good on the menu but none of it tasted any good. We were all starving so I thought something might come out alright, wrong. Would not go here again nor would I recommend to anyone.<//Review><user_name>Cee Cabrera</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80952c7e184a7941:0x4a5dcb8cb4bd0b2f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Tri3d this place out this past week. Heard many good things and have attempted to previous times. But was able to go into this week. Small place but clean, the staff was attentive and courteous.

Ordered a few tacos of carne asada and carnitas. Both were full of flavor and not greasy which is my pet peeve when it comes to tacos lol. The salsa bar was clean and fully stocked. The choice of salsas were plentiful and full of flavor as well.

Nothing that really stands out but nothing negative to report either. I will definitely be back to try their other meats and menu items.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>BOMB tacos and burritos. Prices are very fair. Plenty of tables inside to dine in. They have an awesome taco Tuesday deal. I love their salsa bar cause you can grab all the hot sauces, sliced cucumbers, and lemon you want to dress your tacos and burrito.< /Text>< Resp>

<userid>102125475780706969324<//userid><Text>Well I moved here from Bay Area, and it's been 3 months pass, so I wanted to try delicious taco's my nephew been talking about,
Then we headed to restaurant yesterday and I tried them,
So I told him, this is delicious too you, we should start heading back to Bay Area, cause this food sucks, I ordered 3 Taco De Asada and 1 de pastor .

I been Chef in restaurants and hotel's  for over 26 yrs.
And I can do better job, then these people,
I will never return to this place ever again.
And I noticed, meat had a wierd color, and pastor meat had bad taste to it, well I figured it out, it's all left over meats from pass days.
That's why I had bad stomach ache yesterday and constantly diahrea with onions.< /Text><response>None< /response>< rating>

<text>The chicken tamale was super spicy. I didnt like it.. we got pastor taco. Chicken and carnitas all 3 were great! The carnitas was the best meat. I also got a carnitas sopes.. the best. Hands down i will get that everytime. The wet carnitas burrito was really good, beans rice meat onions and cilantro. They dnt put cabbage on anything but it is in the salsa bar with had really good salsas.. the lime avocado one was the best and the others had some kick but really good flavor. We will be back<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>(Translated by Google) There was some dirt on the tables for the time I was there that was around 10 in the morning the taste of the sauce was good they had more or less good variety in general the rest of the place looked clean the service was also very good although the head taquitos that I ordered were a little small and the meat was overcooked or too soft it is worth mentioning that if you do not like white tortilla unless you want a burrito or tamales maybe it would be good to choose another place

(Original)
Había un poco de suciedad en las mesas para la hora que yo estuve ahí que era alrededor de las 10 de la mañana el sabor de la salsa estaba bien tenían más o menos buena variedad en general el resto del local se miraba limpio el servicio También estuvo muy bien aunque los taquitos de cabeza que yo pedí eran un poco pequeños y la carne se estaba pasada de cocción o sea demasiado suave cabe mencionar que si no te gusta la tortilla blanca al menos que quieras un burrito o unos tamales quizás Sería bueno escoger otro lugar<//text>< Pictures>

We were lucky to get a reservation for breakfast at 8am. I’m so glad we did, it was a great experience. Everyone was sat outside due to the pandemic, they had umbrellas set up to block the sun between tables.
Service was very attentive & prompt! We were very happy with the pleasant service and even happier with the food. Our party of 4 ordered iced vanilla lattes, guava pineapple mimosa, avocado toast, breakfast tacos, 3 Egg Omelette, French toast and some sides. Everything was completely scraped from our plates very quickly so I didn’t get many photos of the food!!

We enjoyed the food, service & ambiance.</Review>

<Review>The experience was great.  From the time we walked into the building.  Friendly staff everywhere.  The food was excellent!! Especially the New York Steak. Highly recommend with mashed potatoes.  Rooftop view was set the atmosphere perfectly. This is the place if your looking for a great meal and great memories.  Definitely a platinum Knife and Fork rating 👌👏<//Review>< Resp>

<Text>Where do I begin. My wife surprised me last week with reservations at the newest spot in town, I was pretty excited leading up to today. I'm happy to say I was not let not, our server Breanna was beyond amazing (is that even possible!?) And made sure were comfortable the whole time, she even tried getting us a table by the railing with the views (didn't know you had to specify when reserving) .  We made sure to try something from the drink/app/dinner menus. I had the Champ and the Jalapeno margarita both excellent choices considering I don't drink regularly. My wife had the darling, another great drink, we made sure to try two drinks that were recommended by the Elderwood. Appetizer was the pork belly, oh were we in for a treat, it was spectacular and should be made into a main dish. As for the the main courses, my wife had the halibut with forbidden rice, fish was nice and moist the way it should as for the sides both the Brussels and forbidden rice were on point. I got the braised short ribs, flavor was amazing my only gripe is it was not as tender as i would have liked. Sides were on point, that flaky pastry with the gravy was amazing. Bottom line I will be going here again and will recommend the Elderwood to everyone I know. Keep it up.  Would have been 5 stars if the short run was more tender.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Very cute place to have brunch.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  It is a little pricey but I felt it was worth it. Staff did a great job of following Covid guidelines and making sure everyone was safe and comfortable.  Would absolutely come back here again.<//Review>< pics>

I ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon and my friend ordered the shrimp scampi. Both dishes were delicious and full of flavor. Our server Breanna also recommended the spicy shrimp as appetizer and it was the star of the night. Would definitely order again! Would recommend having dinner here to anyone and everyone.< /Review>

I gave this place 1 star because that is the lowest I could give. IDK how people are writing nice things about this place. People, be honest, this place is so OVERRATED. When I made my reservations, I requested to be seated on the south sections of the dinning area because we did not want to be seated under a dingy canopy that is set up on the north side.(seriously we are paying TOP Dollar for a rooftop restaurant experience, and they have a big swap meet type canopy set up). Yes, I understand you are worried about the weather, but check the forecast. It has not rained in weeks, and we are not due for any rain in the near future. I got a text a day before to confirm my reservation and I replied "confirm."  I also called to confirm that we would be seated on the south side and not under the "tarp". Amanda, who took my call, assured me that we would be seated in the area I requested. I also asked if there was an elevator to the rooftop because one of my guests is in a wheelchair.  We arrived, and my friend in the wheelchair had to take a service elevator located at the back of the building, thru the hotel, then had to take 2 more elevators to finally get to the rooftop. No one guided her so she had to  figure it out for herself. When we finally reached the top floor, we were directed to then north side dinning. I immediately brought it to the host attention, and let her know we were supposed to sit on the south side. She told me we could not be accommodated there because my party was of 10 guest (my reservation was made for 10) and because we had someone on a wheelchair. I tried to explained to her that I called to confirm, and she rudely cut me off and said "we tried calling you and no one answered, and we left you a voicemail to call us back." What a LIE!!  I have my phone with me at all times, I did not have a single missed call from them and I do not have a voicemail set up, so how did they leave a message? She then said "well I'm sorry."  Had I been alone, I would have left, but my friends were with me, and they too were excited about the "rooftop restaurant" so we stayed.  We were seated under the ugly canopy, on garden chairs and tables you can find at local stores. We had 1 waitress and she was also attending 3 other tables. We were given water upon sitting down, and we asked our waitress on 3 different occasions for straws. we got them about 10 minutes later when one of my guest, said to her "excuse me can we please get those straws,"  she finally brought them. The overpriced menu does not have much to choose from. We stared off with ordering drinks, a few of us had draft beer,, but they were warm, (everyone knows draft beers need to be super cold). The mixed drinks are little and overpriced. Some decorated with and over sized shaped ice. You are paying for an ICE, that is ridiculous. One of my friends ordered a coffee, and asked for creamer and sugar. The waitress obviously forgot and brought them out later when her coffee was cold. We ordered appetizers, I had a mango ceviche, Hmmm 4 whole shrimps, some avocado slices, and some mix of veggie, does not make ceviche, I hated it. The entrees was ok, I ordered the the seafood pasta, but I definitely have had better at other places. Some of my guest were also expressing that they were not impressed with the food, and the service was terrible. We finally each got our $100+ bill, and are automatically charged a 18% gratuity. That is a JOKE!! That explains why our server did not go above and beyond she barely even did her job. Gratuity and tips should be earned and decided by the guest not charged.

Overall, I hated this placed. My party spent over $1,200 just to sit under an ugly tarp, on lawn furniture, eat overpriced food, drink warm beer and receive  terrible service. We would have been better off going downtown and doing the same thing for better food and drinks, and for a fraction of the cost.

I was looking forward to my 45th bday experiencing a dream but it was more like a nightmare. I'm completely disappointed with my experience at" The Elderwood."</review>

With the nighttime in your vision and the wind at your feet it was great from the jump. Our server Kimmie was spectacular in every fashion. We started off with spicy shrimp and pork belly as starters. Both were amazing but the pork belly stole the show. Succulent to say the least. Moving on the entrees we got the shrimp scampi which the wife absolutely loved and the grilled salmon was to die for. Oh yeah did I forget to mention the COCKTAILS. Ay Dios Mio. If you haven’t yet I recommend this place second to none.< /Review>< pics>

Thank you Elderwood for allowing me to do a marriage proposal with family and friends social distancing and guidelines were all kept and had a great time, the food was very good, the view is amazing nothing like it around tulare county being on a rooftop. The staff helped make this special event hough they were busy with other tables.< /Review>

I’ve had the pleasure to eat at The Elderwood twice and both times the entire experience has been nothing shy of amazing. Great food, great drinks, excellent service and an ambiance unlike Visalia has ever seen dining on the historic building’s rooftop. A+<//text>

<review>On Sept. 30, I shared breakfast with my sister & her husband, and we really enjoyed our waiter, Kievit, who was most accommodating, especially when we had to return our 2 Belgian Waffle orders.
Problem....They were not toasted; tasteless,  and had the consistency of rubber...Inedible!
And today it hit me that those waffles were frozen, then heated in a Mocrowave!...not a toaster!!! I was also told I could not have hot tea.🤔
I would definitely enjoy returning to the Elderwood, but only after Someone retrains the "waffle guy"!!!!!</review><Name>Sharon Gregory< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I accidentally ordered the wrong size tires online. When I arrived I was met by Joseph Benavidez. He fixed the problem immediately and although they were more expensive, kept my previous price. I am so grateful! I will keep returning to the Hawthorne Blvd. store. Their service is superb.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

It has been a long relationship with America’s tire company I have done a write up on them before with a five star rating and employees who work together as a team not really knowing who’s in charge because they all work at the same level I have made many friends there over the years as well as other locations there is much to say about this company it’s employees the friendliness they are very courteous very intelligent and knowledgeable regarding Tires safety maintenance reminders by email or texts for rotations they are all outstanding to the highest caliber and should be recognized as a team instead of an individual I would definitely like to say thank you to Gilbert great service very knowledgeable friendly and he will keep you in your budget also Robert A you can always count on this team I many thanks to you Robert as well and the whole america’s Tire‘s team another successful tire purchase there will be many more between my family and friends that I would highly recommend to go to America’s Tire‘s regardless of location they are all excellent professionals. There will be a few pics of tires soon.Thanks again long-time customer< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I am no stranger to this tire shop because I have been there in the past for tire purchases. I was there again yesterday for them to re-balance my tires since I purchase them more than 2 years ago. While I was waiting I had to seat by the window that separates the shop and the waiting area. I couldn't avoid noticing how hard everyone works there but I notice a worker in particular. Fernando. This guy is making the difference at this shop. If the manager gets to read my story I would suggest to him or her to take care of this guy by giving him a raise, tell him how appreciated he is to this business and that customers noticed his efficiency and hard work.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Came in riding on my spare, had the flat tire in my trunk with a screw in it. They plugged the tire and put it on, all for FREE.

I went next door and grabbed some Chinese food, sat in the grass and soaked up some sun. By the time I was finished eating they were all done.

Now that was some A1 Customer Service. When I need new tires, I know where I am going.</review>

<Review>I had trouble getting air into an old trailer tire.  Brought it in to the shop and the guy at the counter helped me out immediately, no questions asked.  I was on my way a few minutes later with a good tire.  I appreciate the service and will come back for any of my other tire needs.</Review>< Pictures>

Came in to get my tire patched. They said it was going to be 2 hour wait. They looked like they had a lot of cars to do so I was cool with it. I waited about 2 hour and a half. Still wasn’t seen. So I walked inside asked them about it and there system said I was already helped. So they apologize and had me pull into the next open spot. They where very nice.  they did a great job handling the situation.< /Text>

Rotation and balance faster than expected. Definitely make an appointment to expedite your service. Take advantage of website to keep track of your vehicles. Friendly and professional staff. This location is next to Y Not Burgers, a 7-Eleven, and across the street from Smog City West and Torrance Tavern if you need another excuse to come to this America's Tire location.<//review>

<Review>Good service. They make the cut to being a decent tire shop in my opinion. I've had some mistakes over the years. But they've always helped me to fix them. I love their tire warranty. All in all, they have been essential to my vehicles running correctly over the years. Thanks a lot guys!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

When I arrived I was met by my car by a service writer that I informed that I had a appointment for a slow leak. When it was my turn I drove the car into the stall and didn't have too get out of car while the tech too the tire off and found the leak and patched it from the inside the correct way to fix a leak. Never had to get out of my car. I recommend these guys they are the best.</review>< rating>

Today I had a flat tire and didn’t know where to go.
So AAA recommended america tire and not only  did they fix my tire with less then 2 hrs on a Saturday.
They didn’t even charge me.
I’m now coming here for any kind of car Maintenance or repair.
Thanks, America Tire!</Text>

<Review>These guys are the best! I only trust these guys at America's Tire Co. to work only my tires! They are very knowledgeable about tires and do a diligent job on my cars. I've been a customer there for more than 18 years. Dub the manager there takes very good care of the customers. They don't take shortcuts. Always torqued the lug nuts to factory specs by hands. Their price match policy is very competitive. And I should mention that tire rotation, flat repair (by removing your tire and patch from inside), and pressure checks are always free of charge whether you're a customer or not. That's what sold me 25 years ago! Highly recommended! I told all my friends and families about these guys!<//Review><response>None< /response>< name>

Such a great experience. Brought my Mini there. Had a nail in the tire. They had me in and out within 30-45 minutes. I was able to stay in my car for Covid purposes. They did the tire repair and a rebalance for free. Great experience.

Went in about a week later with my Abarth. So last year I went to a tire shop near my apartment in MDR and got new tires. I hardy drive the car so I didn’t realize until a couple months later that something was wrong. The car was shaking at highway speeds. I brought it back and they told me my rim was bent and that’s what was causing it. My rim was not bent before going in and I definitely had not been in any scenarios where I bent the rim in between. Needless to say they balanced it as best as they could and told me if it’s still noticeable I’ll need to replace the rim. It was still very noticeable. I decided to bring it to my dealership and have them look at it. They told me that the tires were overly balanced (too much weight) and that my rim was not bent. Needless to say it continued to do it after the fact.

I decided to take my car to America’s tire to get their final opinion before I made my next move. They rotated and balanced all of my tires and told me that the ORIGINAL weights from when I bought my car were still on the rims. Best practice is to remove all weights and start fresh. So needless to say I am very disappointed in the first tire shop and my dealership for giving me run arounds and not taking care of it correctly the first time.

BRAVO America’s Tire! You’ve earned all of my business.</Text>

America's Tire had been my go to place for this for two decades. Not only do they have great prices, but service has also been excellent.

I take my 1966 Corvette, 1967 Chevelle, and my newer cars there for all tire needs. I usually do my own maintenance but have used them for a free rotation once or twice.

They have helped me test fit tires for my cars, saved me money on custom wheels, and allowed me to observe their work directly.</Text>

They have the covid protocol down. I am quite cautious, and I felt safe.
They worked fast and efficiently as a team.
Perhaps, like me, others delayed servicing their tires...so it was super busy!  I recomend making an appt online.
Today, I had a tire patched and rotated and they made it easy.
We've bought dozens of new sets of tires over the years from this company and have always been happy. This location was excellent and I recommend them.</Text>< pictures>

I go here regularly for air checkup, as they have the automated machines that fill the air at set psi. Also, the technicians here are very friendly, and they actually measure the tire tread in front of you and show you whether you need new tires or not, so you know they are not trying to sell you forcefully. As far as the price, I believe they are competitve to Tire Rack, and they may consider matching their price with included installation. But the pricing cannot be compared eye to eye since there might be mfg rebates that might be offered here and not Tire Rack, vice versa.<//review>

This store's customer service is the worst.
There are two people wearing red T-shirts, and the young one is really the worst.
I called the store in the morning and ordered a tire and they told me that they would be able to change the tire around 3PM.
But they didn't call me, and when I called at 4:30 p.m., they told me they wouldn't be able to work today because the tires weren't delivered.
After 5 p.m., they called me and asked me to come quickly. They told me that the tire had been delivered and that we would do it now.
My company was a very close 3 minutes from there, and I went right there.
Inside the store, there was a walk-in line and appointment line, and I waited in the appointment line. A young man wearing a red T-shirt asked me, "Did you make an appointment?" and I said yes.
But he told me today's appointment was over, so I told him this morning that I had made an appointment and that I got a phone call that the tire was ready. He didn't even ask for any my appointment information, and he told me to back to the Walk-in line, no one have a appointment after 5 P.M.
He ignored me without listening to me and received the next guest at the walk-in line. I was still in the appointment line.
There were two employees wearing the red T-shirts, and the younger one was a terrible person.
Not the white-haired one< /review>

America's Tire is a great place to get new tires and any service done on any Tire issues you may have. they have the best prices around when it comes to brand new tires when you buy the new tires from them they will service them for free in most cases. lots of different options to choose from and they also sell rims.< /Text>

<review>The owner(s) and employees at this store genuinely appear to care about each and every customer's well being.  They listen, respond appropriately and respectfully, and even if they try to "up-sell" once in a while, as most businesses do, they never push aggressively.  I have three cars' worth of tires (at least two-times over for each one), and if I ever have any problems with pressure, repair, inspection, or replacement, they are always there to help with just what I need, and are ALWAYS very polite and efficient in getting me on my way.  I recommend this store to anyone I speak to when the subject of tires comes up!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b2114d8b8f5:0xacdd3969722988a7< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Friendly service. I'd recommend setting an appointment. From my experience, walk-ins will usually take an hour and fifteen minutes.< /Text>

I arrived a few minutes before opening time to get a tire replaced for one that failed after 7 months.  I was assisted quickly by a a very pleasant staffer, who informed me that since I had purchased the road hazard warranty, the only charge would be for the warranty on the replacement tire--$27.00.  My car was ready in less than 30 minutes.  The whole experience was efficient and very pleasant.  Kudos to this company.< /Text>

They check air pressure in tires for free and even check tread on tires. We got tires and warranty on them better than othet tire companies. Good price on expensive tires.  Wareanty covers nails as long as not on side. Even though it can be crided they are extremely friendly and fast! Never will I buy tires anywhere else!</Review>

Great experience always!! They patched my tire once for free and I wasn't even a customer yet. The gesture was enough to get me back years later for 4 new tires! Love the customer service.</text>

I've been bringing our cars to A T for over 20 years and without exception I get treated really well. They are always professional, helpful and courteous. I've also checked their pricing and they have always been very competitive. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Super helpful staff, just one thing I didn't like was the one who drove my car in and out of the bay was one of the workers with dirty clothes and still wearing the mechanic gloves that were greasy. So the steering wheel, shift knob, and door handle was sticky to the touch. If they make sure one of office guys do the driving from now on, I would be nice than happy to give a 5 star.</Review>

Had been having problems with my steering wheel shaking in the 50-60 mph range on my Toyota Tacoma. Went to 3 other shops for dynamic wheel balancing including a Toyota dealership and none of them could completely resolve the issue. Not only did ATS resolve the issue, they did it quickly and for 1/3 of the cost the others had charged to not completely fix the problem. Of course I could have just been lucky and assigned a good technician but with how professionally this outfit is run I'm prone to believe all staff is well trained and the quality of work done here in general is top notch.< /Text>

It's a great source of tires (price and quality wise). I've been going there to get a new tires for 10+ years already. The quality of the products and professional level of the staff are outstanding.
I dropped one star for the lack of logic on the logistics level: appointment system is designed to have job done upon one's  arrival. The customers who have made an appointment should not wait 30 minutes for 10 minute job. There is always some room for improvement. I'm sure it will be fixed  in a future.<//text>

Outstanding service, excellent prices, great selection of tires! These are great. Always willing to give the extra effort to make sure everything is perfect. I've been getting tires and services from these guys for over 10 years since I came to the area. I couldn't be happier. They do all my vehicles and are extra careful with my special orders and custom rims. They always accommodate my schedule and go out of their way to make sure I'm taken care of. I always recommend them to whoever needs tires. Extremely high recommendation for anyone thinking about getting tires and tire service here.<//review>

<review>Can be crowded but they work fast. I've mostly had good experiences, always a fare price. Be sure to get the 25.00 dollar warranty on your tires if you get expansive tires. If you get a flat that is not fixable they replace the tire for free. Example nails or screws to close to the sidewall.no questions asked they just replace the tire. At any of the store's they oner ther warranty. In my case that saves me hundreds. Good outfit.</review>< GmapID>

<Review>America's Tire has saved me more times over the past few years. They do free tire repairs for nails in tires (I've had a few repaired here). Also they do free air pressure too. I've recently walked in for a tire replacement and they said they could do it in 30min. Great and pleasant costumer service</Review>< pictures>

I will never go to another tires store.
Three days ago, I was not able to loosen a lugnut from my flat tire. Used the green sealent on the tire so I can get to the tire store.
I noticed the two new tires I bought from a different store a year ago had been rotated diagonally instead in front.
The staff checked tires and they were still good , so they fixed the flat tire, rearranged the tires in right order ,took off the bad lugnut and replace the new one. Every thing cost me a reasonable price.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Fixed my screw in my tire yes but snapped the bead on my tire and refused to help me out unless i bought 4 new tires 3 days later. Id say intentional damage. I didnt ask them to take my tire off just plug a hole. Then they want 80 dollars for one tire. I went else where thank you< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Took my flat tire to get replaced, they didn't have to do anything but replace the tire since I took only the rim with flat tire and I still had to wait about 2 hours to have my tire fix, I guess you have to buy the whole set of tires if you want to get good service out of this place.</review>< pictures>

Cycling through the park this afternoon, I thought it was good and wanted to go in for a stroll. I watched from a distance a man and a woman were skateboarding with three dogs. I didn’t care. Just after the semi-circular metal fence, the three dogs barked and fluttered.  Coming over, the biggest black dog was the fastest and kept biting on me. Fortunately, I resisted with a bicycle for a minute or two before biting me. During the period, the dog owner stood and watched without any reaction.  Take your children to Paramount Park. Please be optimistic about your children and bring dog-proof tools to avoid irreparable physical and mental damage to your family. At the same time, I condemn this shameless dog owner who doesn’t know that the dog is tied to Paramount.  Shame<//text>

This place was amazing! I went with some friends to Disneyland for their kids birthday and we spent hardly any time at Disney because everyone was soo much happier at Great Wolf Lodge! It's great for kids and adults! They have quite a few bars and they even have one with to go drinks! You can even order wine to be sent to your room once the kids are all in bed! Best vacation spot for sure!!</Review>

Very well maintained facility.  Been here for numerous occasions.  Nieces softball,  car show, family get together, etc. I enjoyed my stay there each time. Full featured park and better than most other parks. I don't know if they allow pets but I took my cats there and let them walk around.< /review>

Paramount Senior Center servers lunch on daily basis for seniors (HSA) & once a week dancing & once a month special party events. This facility needs more organized,  special senior doing wherever they want and  don't follow the rules provide by the center. So good luck if you want to joint.< /Review>

<response>None</response><text>Bad for kids. There's one tiny playground area for toddlers to play. Only 2 swings and a pit full of wood chips. I love the padded floor and the little caves. What bothers me is the size, it's not they don't have the space to build a bigger playground, because they do. Disappointing. Then, there's another tiny play area with 2 swings and one of them is for toddler and the other one is special needs. There's a tiny climbing net and a bouncy structure. That's it. Then there's three huge baseball field. What is really great about this park was the excessive equipment area. BOY! THOSE ARE AWESOME! YOU CAN GET QUITE THE WORKOUT THERE. Sadly, the smell of weed, people drinking and a few homeless sleeping in the grass, is what did it for me. After witnessing a drunken fight, I was done.< /text><userid>105158675940865348316<//userid><rate>3</rate><Date>1581982578511< /Date><gmapID>0x80c2cd2092055c6d:0x702b531f8fc757fe</gmapID><username>Gloria Guzman< /username>< Pics>

Meet my sisters and their kids for a day of swimming. My son had a BLAST playing Marco/Polo with his Cousins. The kids never came out the water. This place has vendors along side of the pool in case you need to snack on some chips, diced up fresh fruit, or cool down with a nice beverage.< /text>

<Review>I work for Human Services Association which is located in the park.We have a lunch program for seniors, which is located in Paramount Park.  We serve lunch Monday through Friday This location is one of our largest that we have. On Thursdays we host a dance prior to serving lunch. Today, at the site there were 170 seniors dancing and having a blast.  I am a backup manager for HSA and I found the staff and volunteers at this location to be outstanding.  It is a beautiful thing to see the seniors dressed up and dancing their hearts out. Please come and join us lunch is  a suggested donation of $2.25 for seniors and  it costs  $6.00 (not a donation) for non seniors.  This particular site has a kitchen and the food is prepared on site. This is a great way to keep our seniors happy and socializing.  If you are new to the senior lunch program you must fill out an intake form before you can be a part of this lovely group of people.< /Review>< Pics>

YMCA now runs the pool. Because of that you have to pay a registration fee and pay to get on the pool. My family of 5 had to pay 40$ to swim. If your not gonna go back than it would only be 20$. I just think that's too much for a public pool. But other than that my kids really loved playing in that pool.< /Review>

The bathrooms need to be more sanitary and the boys restroom needs to have doors on the Stalls there needs to be more charger holes on the walls but overall the park was very good and fun. Great place for family and friends and for kids to enjoy.</Review>

<Review>Not a lot of space to walk here as most of it is a baseball field. There is a little exercise area and a small place for kids to play in two different play areas, but unless you want to be on the grass when no one is playing, it’s OK. I would check out the Music sculpture underneath the flag.< /Review></record>

Beautiful park...The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is no soap dispensers or seat covers in the restrooms! The metal toilets reminds me of the ones at the beach.< /review>

<Text>My wife has been coming here since she was kid now that we want to bring our kids the first time we came in with no problems. Second time the staff came out to ask about swimsuits telling my wife she couldn’t get in because of no swim suit after she had already told her she was not getting in the water they still charged us for 2 adults and 2 youth pretty stupid after she clearly told them she  wasn’t getting in. Never coming back again.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>1<//Rating><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<Review>I'm trying to make myself go I am what you call of probably an early Bloomer senior citizen I'm 57 years old and I grew up in the park and I grew up in Paramount when I was a child my mom used to take me there and I used to play in that Park and I used to go for the rectory in the park and now they made it for senior citizens and I would really love to participate but sometimes the hours are hard and I've got so many doctors appointments it I don't know if I can go from the beginning to the end so it's hard but I really want to go because it looks like it's a lot of fun and I can make some new friends cuz it's hard for me to make friends and I really want to go so I hope to make it to at least couple of the classes and it looks like a lot of like there's a lot of nice people to meet so I'm hoping to make it there one day for a class instead of just going to get information so I hope somebody else can make it for me have a wonderful time there because I know I will soon as I can get my stuff there and the food smells wonderful there every time I go there either finishing eating or starting to eat so go have fun</Review></record>

Very great park. I always take my kids during summer vacation, they enjoy the play area they have. They are learning how to swim little by little.< /text>< pics>

Definitely a good place to spend a afternoon, just beware of the homeless alcoholics wandering around. They keep to themselves but they are still present. There used to be an outdoor pool here also but I'm unsure what ever happened to it.< /Review>

It allows plenty room for many of activities for kids but can be cleaned up more. It's very family involving which is great. Only complaint is it should and could be more clean.<//text>

<Review>Mid-size park next door to Paramount High School. Senior Center, 2 baseball diamonds, outdoor workout area, several reserveable areas for barbeques and parties. Also a gymnasium and outdoor pool. Local car clubs use the parking lot for unofficial car shows on the weekend. The downside is the park gets crowded and noisy at times. Lots of locals hang out at the tables and don't seem to be doing anything. The restroom facilities could be nicer. All in all its an ok place to visit.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>3</rate><Resp>None<//Resp><user>106987431096608619251</user>< gmapID>

< Review>
I was harassed by Parmount police @844pm he threaten to give me a citation for talking to someone in the parking lot... When the park is still full of people. But he singled me and only me out because i was Standing and taking while Black. When i told him this, he said the park closes at 8pm. I looked around. And said well tell all of them that ( speaking of the park full of Hispanic people) he then got on his loud speaker and said mumbled something and then told me "now LEAVE" while his patrol car was in front of mines...another case of abuse of power and racism. No more Paramount Park for my Family.<//Review>

This is a nice clean park but I wish they had more swings for the kids. My daughter loves to swing but it is cutthroat to get a swing on a busy weekend. They do have a pool for the summer and a soccer court and a baseball field. And most P aramount city. Events are held at this park.</Review>

My experience in the paramount pool has been a nightmare. I have a 3 year old attending the Tiny Tots class, at the beginning everything was perfect my son loved going to swimming classes. Until the 2 month they changed the swimming instructor and everything changed. The teacher ( IF ) I can call her teacher because she does not care about the students at all.  If my son did not wanted to do an activity she did not care to encourage him to do it, she did not even told him one’s.  One day she put my son time out because he said the word “no” to an activity. I agree with her that he need time out, what I don’t agree and I am very sad and disappointed with is because the way she talk to my son. Is not what she told him is HOW she told him.  Since that day my son is afraid of her, as soon as he sees her he starts crying and tells me that he is scare, and that he does not want to see lifeguards. To make things worse the City of Paramount staff did not do anything about it, and doubt my son. What I know as a fact a toddler is not going to be afraid of an adult just because. I recommend to all parents to think twice before enrolling their toddler to this class.</Text>

Went to the pool for an hour.  Was refreshing. Had numerous life guards on duty. Lots of seating but there was lots of people so didn't get a chair but just left our things out of the way. They do have cubbies to use at your own risk.  Also lockers for 25 cents. Showers if needed but no curtains or anything. Restrooms and benches to sit. Paramount fee is $2 and wrist band for the pool season for $1 and $1 there for after.  Not bad since it's close to home.  There were lots of kids but still room to swim. I would go back on a hot summer day.  Water wasn't to cold either.
They close at 3:30pm on the dot. Not at 4pm like the web says.< /text>

We were recommended to visit the set at Agoura by someone from the Visitor Center at Calabas (Santa Monica Mountains district), situated some 20 mins (or so) from the location. It's a treat, but especially if you love the old wild westerns. No doubt John Wayne and Clint Eastwood regularly rode into town looking for trouble! GOOD: A well designed, laid out ghost town used primarily for filming. While you can't go into every building, the shops and homes are impressive and extremely authentic. When we went, there was literally no other tourists so getting shots of the family together was a challenge. Thank goodness for the iPhone timer options. Recommend going to the jail and if you like, go behind the bars. No doubt some of you deserve your sentences! There's plenty of parking - allow for 45 to 60 minutes.BAD: Rest easy, no one will hang in Paramount's ranch but you may starve! There is a little visitor hut near by but if you're looking for proper snacks/food, there isn't much there. No tour guide but you can do this on your own.RECOMMENDATIONS: Bring water with you on a hot day<//text>

Big park, plenty of seating, public restrooms, shade, the cool thing is that they have a swimming pool with swimming lessons in the summer.</Text>
