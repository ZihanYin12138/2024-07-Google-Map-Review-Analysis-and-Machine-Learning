We swung into town last minute hoping to kayak the Channel Islands and needed daycare for our Goldendoodle. Enter Doggin Around Daycare to save the day; they were able to accommodate her in short notice and work with us on timing. Their massive indoor facility is amazing and they did a wonderful job. Our puppy played and played. She was returned to us exhausted and ready for bedtime. It was so nice to being about to entrust her to their care without worry. Thank you Doggin Around Daycare!<//review></record>

We took our girl for the 4 hour trial and she did great so we decided to bring her back for some day care. While we were out we realized we wouldn't make it back in time to pick her up for the day. We called and the said no problem they had a spot for her to stay the night. Friendly staff and more importantly she has fun.</Text>

I have never been disappointed with Healthy Spot. Great selection, super helpful and knowledgable staff, the grooming is on point and my dog and I never leave unhappy. For grooming, be sure to ask for Inyeah (I know I probably didn't spell that right) or Patrick! Both of these groomers are AMAZING! Thank you all for the continuous help, the answers, and making our dog look like 5 million bucks!< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Let me start by saying that my dog is adopted and has severe separation anxiety and strangers anxiety. Now that my husband and I started working full time, we had to find a daycare for our dog and we couldn't be happier to have found Doggin Around.
They assess your dog and find him the best possible group to play and spend his day according to his personality and his needs. Our dog now LOVES to come here! Every morning when I grab the lunch box he knows we are coming and he gets so excited, and when we get there he will start jumping and wining if they don't open the door fast! In the afternoon when we pick him up he is happy and tired after a day of play! He also loves the staff! Never we have seen our dog wagging his tail and letting other people pet him... this has been THE BEST place for our dog to relax and spend his day!
The staff is very nice, they accommodate to your schedule as much as possible, the location is big and clean and they treat your dog like you would. Prices are affordable as well.
I recommend this place 100%!!!</Text>< pics>

<text>The best judge of Doggin Around is my Husky, Poppy, and SHE LOVES IT!  When we drive close she starts to cry in the car, she barks at the staff because they aren’t getting her fast enough to bring her in the back to play and she runs in place to get through the door!
Jennifer and the staff are super. They watch them if they are getting tired and need some downtime and let them eat in private. They really respect them.
I feel totally confident when I drop Poppy off.
The prices are reasonable and worth the happy Husky who comes home.
Offering grooming and other services are more pluses!
Thank you Jennifer and staff at Doggin Around!
Poppy thinks you’re the best and she loves your treats!  She’s also made lots of good friends.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Jennifer always accommodates us when we need Lola our German shepherd cleaned, groomed,  and usually left for a play day. We usually call or text her last minute and she's always been there for Lola and Lola comes home looking,  smelling so nice. And she sleeps like a baby after her play time with the other dogs.< /review></record>

<Review>my dog likes this place. At first I was a little unsure, there is some turf for them to play on it on and concrete, not grass, which is confusing for the pup if your pet is taught not to go on concrete.. besides that my dog likes it a lot so we keep going. No aggression issues. They were going to be opening a new location over by the collection which we can't wait for.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Super easy & convient daycare. Jennifer made my whole day much less stressful as I didn't have to worry about my best 4-legged friend. They took my pup as a same day, new client while I was passing through Ventura with my toddler on our way to Santa Barbara for the day. When I picked him up he was as happy as can be & took a nice long siesta through the evening.</Text>< user>

<Review>Compassionate long tenured staff who have a genuine affection for their charges. My three mutts literally bound through the door to get in as they love it so much. I trust them implicitly to care for and ensure my furry compadres have a fun day. I've been a customer for years and have only wonderful things to say about their staff and services.< /Review>< rating>

I love this place and the entire friendly staff.  Always have peace of mind when dropping my furry friend off for the day or overnight stays.  Jen and the staff always gave us  a warm greeting and took great care of our dog, Layla.  Most importantly, Layla loved going and always came home tuckered out!  Moved away, but miss these guys very much!  Thanks, Doggin, for always being there for us!!<//Text>

Amazing experience leaving my 10 month old weimaraner for the weekend to attend a festival 💖 he had a blast i can tell! And they gave him a bath right before I took him home:)  it's a really nice place with wonderful, loving, attentive staff. I'll be making reservations for Huxley with Doggin Around anytime I need a sitter in ventura 🐾</review>

his leg.  Dr. Mandel found it to be melanoma and called me after hours
to give me the news.  This was on a Friday.  On Saturday (her time off)
she arranged to have him seen by a visiting specialist on the following
Friday because of a heart condition my dog has and will need to
be addressed before the growth can be removed.  She also fit me in
to her practice for tests to make sure the cancer has not traveled.  Dr. Mandel truly cares and wants to give the best possible care
for your pet.  I truly can't thank her enough!!  My doggie has a much
better chance of getting through this because of her!!  Her staff is
great also!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

They lost my dogs medical records for the la say two years. Then told me i must have changed my name, or the $150 i spent September of 2020 was for heart worm not for actual vet services. When it most definitely was because my dog was sick.</text>

It is so gratifying to all of us to take care of a patient over time and identify, diagnose and treat the problem and make them better. Moreover, that long term relationship with Bailey and her "parents" is special as well.  Glad your girl is doing so well!!! P.S. Yes, the COVID lockdown does make veterinary practice more challenging. Thank you and all our patients and clients for their patience and understanding during these times.

<text>JeffPark takes awhile, most likely a  result of  lockdown, and a bit pricey but Dr. M is the best and you get what you pay for.  Bailey was one of her first patients 9 and a half years ago, just six months old and could fit in the palm of your hand.  She wouldn't be here now without her.  Saved her bacon more than once since.  I'd go as far as to say with Dr. M you get several vets in one, with her extensive degrees and training.  Love our chats.  Staff is great as well.  The best for your furry companion.</text>< Rating>

I like the people here but it shouldn't take 2+ hours to examine a dog. He wasn't traumatized and that's a good thing but I left 3 hours between that appointment and another one and almost didn't make the second appointment. I also think a pet owner HAS to be allowed in despite COVID, for a first visit.</text>

I called the facility to schedule an appointment. She was very understanding and answered many of my questions. She had great customer service. The condition of the animal was extremely better in two days and cured within three. I was able to call and cancel the appointment with no push back or fees. Highly recommend and appreciated.< /review>

They were professional and very nice to talk with.  They were upfront and explained what needed to be done.  I would have liked to go inside, but Covid is happening so they have to remain safe when seeing our animals.  Very Nice staff.</text>

Great staff, took great care of our cat. Even sent us home with a free ice pack in the cat carrier, because it was a very hot day.</Review>

Excellent vet and staff. I always choose a vet just based where I live (I never do any research) so I am really lucky to have found this place.  I’ve lived in 4 different cities since getting this cat, so I’ve been to 4 different vets. This one is by far the best. This vet is really good with my difficult and grumpy cat, and you can tell she really actually cares. Her staff is wonderful too. I feel grateful to have found them, and if I move again, I will continue to come here.</Review>

Excellent care !  I just adopted a tiny deaf white Persian kitty who has had multiple medical problems her whole life.  Many requiring surgery and many needing long term care. Daisy is frightened of anyone touching her, and any vet care at all is just plain hard to do. Her Persian fur was the worst matted mess I have ever seen.  These are the folks that were recommended to me and was I ever pleased. We talked in the room and developed a plan of care before Daisy was even handled. Then with precision we started, Dr Mandel gave a little sedation that was easy and gentle on her system to begin with and then did all of the needed tests and ended with removal of all of her mats.  They were so deep that she had to shave her down to pink! Then with gentleness and care she held Daisy until she awakened from the sedation and I took her back.  If you want good care and a deeply knowledgeable  Doctor to care for your pet.  This is the place !!</Text>

<text>Dr. Mandell and the staff here are AMAZING! ❤️

I have a 15 year old cat who has always been terrified to go to the vet. His sweet personality would change and he’d get so scared that he wouldn’t let anyone near him without trying to attack them. It was extremely stressful for both of us. I felt helpless when I discovered a lump in his tail, fearing he wouldn’t let anyone examine him without causing him great stress.

But Dr. Mandell (The Cat Whisperer) ❤️ was so sweet and patient with him. She even got him to take treats from her hand, and I was shocked! He was able to get examined and also received the surgery needed, and she treated him with care. I felt a lot of peace in trusting Dr. Mandell and staff with my cat and I’m very grateful for all their help! I won’t take my cat anywhere else! ❤️</text>< GmapID>

<review>Dr. Mandell is wonderful!  She cares about each of her patients and clients.  She has vast experience and the ability to run tests in-house, and she will help you decide what is right for your pet even when the decisions are tough.  The prices are very reaonable.

< review>
I'm sure a great place but after what they did to us I'm disappointed in there live for a pet. . It seems more about money,  I took my cat in 12 min before 6 pm cuz my cat seemed as if he'd been poisoned so we rushed in and were told because staff would have to stay over 6 pm we were gonna get a walk in emergency charge and seemed to not really want to see our baby,  they told us it would be best to go some where else , it's pretty sad when some one comes in desperate to help there animal and it's about money and them wanting to go home over a animals life.  And my animals are regular customers and had been seen there before for there shots but our vet was out so the other would have to step in. . NOT GOOD BUSINESS.. YOUR SUPPOSE TO CARE MORE ABOUT ANIMALS THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DID. :( SAD we found another place that was closed but had no problem looking at with no charge and told us what to do. . They cared and it showed.< /review>

<Review>The Dr. claims to be the dog whisperer and will not let you make a choice in your pets care. As she put it, "I'm the "veterinarian." We went in for head congestion and was told it could be heartworms. She also proceeded to squeezed my dogs treachea to prove tracheal bronchitis. Yup, she will gag if you squeeze her trachea. I asked her if we could treat the congestion first, before ordering tests and she insisted on a heart worm test and xrays. The doctor walks in very combative and thinks she knows it all before reading the chart or discussing the symptoms with you. After she hushed my dog and pressed her fingers on her to supposedly "calm her down", I lost all faith in her. My dog wasn't doing anything, instead, looking at her while she imitated Cesar Milan by pressing her fingers into my dog and shushing her over and over. When I thanked her for her time, she asked how much I expected to spend. I looked at her and said I wanted to treat her cold and if that didn't work we should then do more labs. She was offended that I had an opinion about my dogs care. She is crazy and money hungry, don't go there. Before walking out she let me know I would spend more money going to the VCA.<//Review><resp>None<//resp></record>

Just not what I expected for a sick cat. I went to the wrong Vet, I should have went to VCA.</Review>

< Review>
This is the best Vet clinic ever.... I do TNR (trap neuter & Release) in my neighborhood & I brung my Socsy & Sammie for their shots & Emergency checkups. This has been the BEST Vet ever. I was even given a opportunity to make payments once on an Emergency for my very Ill cat Socsy (15 yr old tux kitty) with Hypothyroidism & is on hypoallergenic hydrolized protein that costs $56 biweekly. It gets expensive but since I come ever two weeks. My cat is still alive & I appreciate Dr Mandell ... Had it not been for Dr Carroll Mandell Socsy would be Dead he was so sick, I didn't know how sick he was.. she saved him. DR MANDELL also performed the spaying on Sammie & gave me a deal on the E -collar. I love this clinic its the Best.. so clean , & the nurses are so gentle with the babies  (kitties)
I'm stopping by today before closing to get Socsy's Hypoallergenic food...
I know I won't have to wait long. Everyone is super nice may God Bless them.<//Review>

<Text>Be careful taking your pets here! They're more interested in selling services than your companions well being. They wanted to hospitalize my puppy for an upset stomach after testing negative for parvo. When I declined hospitalization they wanted to charge me $115 for blood work but could not tell me what they were testing for. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired as well. I had to stand at the desk for way too long without being acknowledged by the receptionist while she spoke to a vendor on the phone. Total waiting time in the room was almost 2 hours. This does not include a 20 minute lecture by the vet tech about what a bad puppy owner I am. They wouldn't even let me out of the room to pay for the services, made me wait while they ran my card. And even asked me not to let Stella's paws touch the floor on the way out! I went to another vet in Sacramento for a second opinion. He advised me to feed Stella rice, cottage cheese, yogurt and canned pumpkin for 2 days. Add chicken the 3rd day. And begin mixing in her puppy food after that. He also advised administering pepto-bismal with a syringe to settle her stomach and mix pedialyte with her water for dehydration. Wish I had gone to him first. I would have saved almost $100 for an unnecessary fluid IV (which I practically had to administer myself) and an anti-nausea injection. I wonder how many clients would have followed this vet's first recommendation to hospitalize my 7 week old puppy. And to the vet tech with the pit bull with skin allergies and neurotic Labrador that destroys your furniture when you don't exercise her because she's afraid of the rain who lectured me.....please read this. "The primary and most important time for puppy socialization is the first three months of life. During this time puppies should be exposed to as many new people, animals, stimuli and environments as can be achieved safely and without causing overstimulation manifested as excessive fear, withdrawal or avoidance behavior. For this reason, the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior believes that it should be the standard of care for puppies to receive such socialization before they are fully vaccinated." I would add that many skin problems in dogs are caused by stress that can be alleviated with proper exercise. And your lab wouldn't tear up your furniture if you exercised her daily (and that doesn't mean a simple walk around the block when the sun is shining) And who ever heard of a Labrador being afraid of the water??! She's afraid of the rain because you never take her out to play in it! But what do I know? I'm no vet. But I don't appreciate the lecture or the attempt to extort my hard earned dollars for unnecessary and psychologically damaging treatment like leaving a 7 week old puppy in a cage overnight because she's slightly dehydrated from a mild case of a sore tummy. I will never set foot in this establishment again and I would advise anyone reading this to seek treatment elsewhere< /Text><userid>103549489339599087211< /userid></record>

<Name>Tracy Jemison<//Name><text>I signed up for "Science of Well Being" to receive the certification. I enjoyed the class and the professor, however I went through tech support to see why it is not showing I took the class. I also in the last two week was inquiring how to ascertain the certificate I paid for. I have my receipt to prove I paid for the course including certification. Yes, I did complete the course! Unfortunately the class would rate a 5 , but the customer service and not being able to resolve and unresolved issue after two weeks is just not acceptable.< /text>< Time>

Incorrect certification given that also after 4months. Worst customer service experience !!!

Issue: I did one of the professional certification courses in Coursera as their content was pretty nicely put together and the USP being the certificates along the the badges with the respective companies/brands.

I never received my final Coursera certification even after 4months of completion of my course. I did everything on time, no payment due & of course nevertheless my effort and time behind it. After reaching out Coursera accepted they had an issue on their backend system which prevented from issuing the final certificate !

Ok, but then the certificate has the passing date. 4months late than when it actually should be :( The delayed dates reflects my career progression, which is untrue.

Current stage:
I also pointed out some possible architectural cause and solution which can probably resolve this issue (being an outsider and with my limited knowledge). Upon emailing customer care, I have been informed that this has been escalated but no clear idea on when this will be resolved or even a promise that till be ever resolved.

The authenticity of a certification is the details mentioned in it. I didn’t take this course as any other online course for sake of completion and getting a certification at the end.

I did everything right, paid on time then why should I suffer just because their is a technical glitch on your backend.

I have emailed customer support, tweeted it and now leaving this review to get attention.

I feel not only frustrated with Coursera but it’s more like any other e-learning platform with standing true or giving true values to their main selling point and authenticity !

My suggestion:
Don’t be a fool & stay away.... There is plenty of online resources to learn from at a cheaper price and no false promise.<//Text>

I have been charged for months now , will it ever end? I signed up for the Google IT specialist Certification, I started the first class and then it would not let me log back in.  It has been 4 months now, and I keep getting charged 49.60 every month. How do I end this nightmare?< /text>

Don't let the .org extension fool you.  This is literally setup to extract the most money from you, including by outright taking money after you've completed a course simply because they happen to have your payment information.  There is no means for you to speak, chat, or communicate with a company representative to ask for a refund.  The help section is a loop intended to frustrate you and to force you to give up as I finally did.</Text>

The content of the course are interesting and the videos are easy to follow. Every week ends with a quiz, an assignment that needs to be completed and you're also required to review your peers in the class. The problem is that usually, you end up doing the quiz and the assignment in one day, and then you're forced to wait days/weeks until someone else submits an assignment you can review. So even though you're finished with 95% of the course you're stuck waiting and not knowing when you'll be able to finish. In theory, I suppose you could wait months if nobody else takes the course. Meanwhile, Coursera continues to take your money.<//Text>

<Review>No customer service, no help over 7 months, endless voice messages left, contacted through the bank, NO HELP. Just feel terrible and being robbed when no classes were taken you have been charged without knowing only to realize in the bank statement. Unable to request a refund or resolve the issue. Very frustrating. I can't understand as to why a customer service help is buried in "HELP articles" and no articles lead to you contact anyone.

Terrible company who charged me secretly. I just canceled that course and have no idea how that happened. The most ridiculous thing is there is no phone number or email address for people to contact!

READ CAREFULLY before subscribing to Coursera. I was double charged on my credit card and customer support refuses to refund the $50 for 1 month, although I DID NOT use their services or had any intention of doing so. There is no customer support line, no escalation to management, no way of getting in touch with anybody. See below screenshots.< /Review>

Beware. This outfit not only legally prohibits fair-use reviews of their coursework (verified by email inquiry), they send out emails to their account holders with no remove-me-from-this-list option. Even their web site has no option for getting such problems resolved. You have to track down their corporate offices to get a phone number, which they do not answer during their normal business hours. Every option for remedy requires login, which is not available. Nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. There have to be educational opportunities run by people with more attention to basic courtesies and honesty. Caveat emptor.< /review>

There is no way you can contact the customer service through mail or phone. Don't get trapped with COURSERA (FAKE PROMISE).

I have applied for financial aid , after 15 days i got a message that it is approved . but still 49$ will be deducted. And when i want to  ask why like that. there is no way you can contact through mail.

And when i see the FAQ's it says that you should not opt for free trails when you applied for financial aid ??????????????

Coursera will only mislead us after applying for financial aid. they say that your application is under process, mean while you can join the free trails!!!!!

and if you opt it than your application will be canceled , but they send the mail that it is approved..

Its so bad that even the esteemed institute like coursera will mislead people and do like this.

if you don't want to give the financial aid . then remove that option . simple don't trap the people by doing like this..

If you have any concern regarding this .   rectify this issue.< /text>

Let me give you a feel of how things are being handled.... First they have disconnected their phone, then they have hired Zendesk to answer the students questions about their "verified track". Zendesk lives up to its reputation, meaning that it is a black-hole with people at the other side of the planet that copy paste answers to questions they do not even read and most likely can't understand either anyway. So when you want to submit your ID, Coursera asks you to pay before they check if they will accept your ID... ( Yeah gimme the money and I tell you that you have a problem after I hold the money). THEN they switch you to Zendesk and living hell arises. I have written to Zendesk to let them know that I would post a bad review if they keep copy paste unrelated gibberish instead of answering my question... And I am still waiting, therefore, here is the first bad review:  I am left wondering if Coursera is ANOTHER of these companies in the US that nickels and dimes you and offers strictly no customer service.... Will keep you posted but so far: Very bad experience; don't pay for the signature track, it is a total loss of money; at the slightest problem, it is hell.< /text>

<review>Machine learning Class sucked.  This was the second awful experience I had with coursera:  MongoDB class was also impossible to complete.

I watched the first two weeks video's, but after logging out/back in they were no longer listed as having been watched.  Navigating the site is a pain as there is such a high latency that any click I made took so long to respond that frustration was immediately the result of navigating the coursera site and course pages.  Videos played but would automatically bypass their built-in quizzes and just play the videos without allowing me to perform the quiz portion, so it was impossible to determine if I was on the correct path.

Video's that were useful were impossible to navigate as attempting to fast forwarding or rewind to a previously watched section was nearly impossible... the settings bar never(or, hardly ever... i had to reload the page if i wanted to move around in the video because watching the videos made my browser wholly unresponsive...) shows and makes it impossible to navigate the videos.  The pause/unpause function work fine, just navigating is frustratingly slow. I gave up on watching the vector videos over and over... they were not that informative and did not have any real content, so watching them over and over was a waste of my time.  long, and drawn out 15 minute video's could have been bypassed with a printout that could be read and fully comprehended in ~10-15 seconds, and speeding up the videos using the speed setting makes the web pages completely un-navigable.

the quizzes are a joke: repeat the same questions over and over until you get the correct answers.  If you do not get the correct answers, there are no methods for you to learn what you did wrong: you are only told that you provided a wrong answer and re-directed to watch the same videos which you obviously did not understand in the first place- over and over again- until you "do" "get it", which for me was never.

After two futile attempts- and a major wast of my precious free time- I can not recommend Coursera classes to anyone serious about learning.  Use Youtube; it will be easier to watch their videos.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>Rude customer service from the owner's daughter and the employee John they pick who they want to serve. And so rude when they speak their language that no one else understand. I would have gave them a zero star but I had to give it a star.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Worst Nail experience ever!! I just wanted to get french tip nails and instead left with a bleeding thumb. A man with a twitching disorder "did" my nails. I should've known better. I asked him to re- do my thumbnail because it was crooked, and he kept insisting it was fine. He was really rough with my thumb, and it started stinging and he said it was fine, and I pulled my hand away from him, and he still kept saying it was fine. How can it be fine when it's stinging and bleeding. The other nails were done wrong too. Tracy was nice enough to fix this mess . What a nightmare!<//Review>

1 star is being generous VERY RUDE!!! When I went to get my nails done I asked if they could do the design I liked and they said they could if I decide on a different color so I did and the lady did acrylics and filed down until my nail was bleeding and in pain I said it hurt but she said it was just a mistake and brushed it off then the lady said she couldn't do the design and would just do her own thing even if I didn't like it and told me I had to pay her BEFORE she even started my nails  I had to pay $30 and when I said I didn't want her design i wanted my own and before she started she said she would she made a bug scene screaming in my face saying to never cone back talking about me in a different language and she took them all off and even after everything was done all she wanted to give back was $5 and I said told her I'm not trying to have a scene I could choose something  else she said I was difficult  and started screaming  at me telling everyone I was wrong and talking about me then she threw the money at me and told me to leave and never come back right now my nails are well a disaster and in to much pain to go anywhere else.< /review>

Its was a bad experience... She chipped my toe nail then glued it back on and polished over it... There equipment didn't work. The shop was dirty. She rushed everything.  She made us pay before she was done. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.</review>

They did my nails cute but they started lifting after 4 days I went back for them to fix my lifting nails but they were rude!!!! I didn't feel like a paying customer. They need to learn how to talk to people and how to treat customers!!! I left and went to another nail shop down the way and they fixed my  lifting nails.< /text>

went there for a basic mani/pedi. Paid $22. I was only in town for 1 day and it was Mother's Day so alot of places weren't open. Got home the next day with a little pain on my pinky. Woke up the following day with a full blown swollen, infected pinky. Now i need to go to Emergency and have them drain the infection out ! THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING ! NEVER GO THERE! NEVER EVER!<//Text>

They have the worst customer service!! This lady got mad at me because I asked her to wash her hands because I caught her digging in her nose. So she didn't want to do my nails. Then another lady  told me if she didn't want to I could go somewhere else. They're really dirty I would never come back!</text>

(Translated by Google) The place is fine but it is a little messy and the spa chairs are a bit visually destroyed and the ones that serve you are kind ... The price for the services is accessible

<text>My mom brought me here as a kid, I fell in love with them , i always been happy with the service,
Im relieved they didnt close down.
I usually get what i call the "Dela special" carne asada w chicken stuffed burrito.
Green and red sauce with everything in it. Wet or dry.
W a coca cola ✨
Sooooooo worth it .< /text>< Gmap_id>

Experience today was not the best. My family and I ordered our usual Red Chile burritos with rice, cheese, and onions. However, it looked like we came around the time they were closing so our burritos were very dry with hardly any red sauce! It was literally what we asked for and we were very disappointed. They should have just turned us away instead of making us these terrible burritos. Never go when they are about to close.</text>

I came from all the way from Anaheim just for a breakfast burrito (which are delicious), calling on the phone as well since 930am and no one answered, when I got there, its was about 10:02 just for them to tell me they were not serving breakfast and I wasn't the only one waiting and got the bad news. This place has great food but is poorly managed. Not a way to run a business.<//text>< Pictures>

Great store. Wonderful selection of yarns and accessories and expert advice. Trudy and Karen are helpful and incredibly patient. And knitting has been such great therapy during the pandemic. So lucky to have Yarnitudes in Sonoma County!</review>

<text>Wonderful spot. Friendly ladies who are passionate & super helpful in knitting and crocheting. I made some fun scarfs here. And love coming back to “sit and knit” with whoever is here working on their projects. Trudi, the owner is very sweet and helpful. Very relaxing environment. Special place to buy yarn and other goodies ad well as socialize. 😊</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfhlnK4EcjmshhVw_08bRweFy-ZK6_Z9YGDUzP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw_TF4EPeeT3I8626fTBL3k_1LZ9o1QXc4Mv7o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzd_fWuhs5sy3kQ8VTQTvhGf2s8K7_73XPwPDI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5voPtrsOYQDcT1LxTPPHFYfojdYaPlhNumbSI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Great knitting shop in the middle of nowhere, but worth the drive! (Easy to find) Large with Lots of inventory, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Great place to let time slip by....
Prices are reasonable too. Maybe best shop in North Bay.</review>

<Text>This is a beautiful store for knitters and if you like crochet. A great selection of wonderful yarns and good needles and other knitting and crochet supplies. The store is a bit dark which can be difficult if you're looking for matching colors. I like that I can look around in my own time and no one bothers me. Prices are okay. They also offer classes.<//Text><response>None< /response><Date>1540511466304</Date></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly and helpful staff, good variety of yarns. And they printed out patterns for a couple of items and most welcomely took the skein of yarn one of us bought and made it into a ball ready to work. They had a knitting class going on when we were there.< /Review>

I love going in to Yarnitudes.  The building is old, and there is nothing more comfy in my opinion than the old hardwood floors, tables, chairs, walls full of wool and friendly people to greet you when you come in.  And they're great about ordering any supplies you need if they don't carry it which makes it so easy to indulge.</text>

This location NEVER answers the phone! Want to have them cater? You have to go in person to make arrangements.
Want to order for Christmas/ New Year's? Forget it, this location will be closed for the holidays.
Seems they don't want your business as they will not answer the phone or take orders for the end of the year holidays.
Too bad, as their food is good but their business management is pathetic.<//text>

<Review>Finally got around to trying Luisa and Sons in Cerritos. They're situated in strip lot on South Street, next to Cafe 86. It's a small bakery serving up classic Filipino pastries and desserts like egg pie, cassava, turon, sponge cake mamon and many more. What caught my eye was their display case of hopia which I heard was good. They have several selections on hand like mung bean, red bean, ube and baboy (made out of pork fat, candied winter melon and green onions).

I decided to try a dozen ube hopia (85 cent each) and half dozen chicken empanadas. The chicken empanadas were tasty and crust was on point, but unfortunately their ube hopia was a complete disappointment. The ube flavor was lacking and quality of crust wasn't flaky. Both essential characters to good hopia. it just tasted like standard pastries without any soul and originality.

All in all, the experience was okay. The hopia place near my house is so much better. Return visit is unlikely, but if you decide to come here anyways skip the ube hopia.

Note: For some nutritional facts, mongo or mung bean helps lower blood cholesterol levels, helps prevent breast cancer and also it has low sugar level. So if ever you are on a strict diet, this hopia mongo will surely be a good pick. Make sure to mention that to your doctor.

< Review>
It's a nice little store.  Many items filipino flavor but the only problem is the Turon. My wife and I went  in today to get turon. There were 5 in the tray.  Of course the greedy man in front of us takes all 5. We ask if there is more...sure there is the guy says but it is all for placed orders...these are just extra we sale up front. That is so wrong...Turon should b available til the eve...dont aay no to a customer...that just makes us not want to go back...make the sale.  Avoid losing face</Review>

<Text>I was recommended to visit Luisa and Sons Bake Shop for great Lumpia's. I happened to be in the area doing some shopping and my Google maps brought up that I was within distance of a place I wanted to visit. I am so glad to have that option set and to maps running in the background of my phone. I did not realize how close I was and have wanted to visit for some time now.  I was too late for Lumpia's, as the friendly staff informed me they sell out early on weekends and it's better to place an order in advance. I will tell you their baked goods did not disappoint! I enjoyed the brownies, marbled bread and banana bread on this trip and look forward to coming back for some "ube" goodies. I was so excited to be there, I forgot to take pictures. Next time. Enjoy!< /Text>< username>

<Text>Empanadas outside bread were hard and dried, must have been old.  In addition, I bought one ensimada with cheese on top and after opening the wrapper I noticed there were gray looking spots on top realizing they were molds, again just have been sitting  on rack so many days.  Cheese doesn't go well when not refrigerated.<//Text>< pics>

Such good pastries. I really like the chicken empanadas (90 cents a pop) and the ubehopias (50 cents). The chicken empanadas are the perfect mix of sweet and savory. The ubehopias are choc full of sweet, smooth ube.

This is a really cute Filipino bakery that you should check out if you're in the area!< /review>

< Review>
If you are in Cerritos area and want a quick fix to your Filipino cuisine craving, this is a good place to go. They have siopao, palabok,  guinatan, ensaymada, freshly baked hopia,  empanadas and a lot more. Turon and okoy are always disappearing from the shelf. Sometimes you'd need to wait for the next batch or order in advance.<//Review>

< Review>
Love the Ube tarts and many of the other baked products that they make. Cheesy pan de sol was also very good.  Have had Ube Jam and pecan tarts in the past and they are very good as well.  The Ube pies are also one of my other favorites.  Definitely worth the visit if in the area.  Cash and credit card are accepted and the customer service was good<//Review>

I ordered 22 Turon just this past Sunday from Cerritos store. There were at least 8 with unripped and hard as a rock bananas. I stopped counting at 8. Beware!
I've tried calling the Cerritos today. it was a recording, closed for renovation. Then I called Norwalk and Carson, no one answered.<//text>

<Review>I so wish they had more locations , this is a must go to spot for some yummy mierenda (snacks) and desserts and some pre-cooked foods . I always make a point to stop at one of their locations, when I'm in the area . They are one of the few locations that's offers chicken and pork bola bola siopao . They also have amazing variety of these candied calls and boat tarts . Not to many places make these candies goodies .
They used to make a good pancit palabok, but I must say they have a new recipe or different cook. I do prefer the older version of the palabok verses this new one .
But , not to worry I'll still come here for their many goodies to choose from.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Lotta empanada for da dolla, I holla!

Just $0.60 gets you one of these bad boys, the Pilipino chicken empanada
Flaky, sweet, savory & oh so delicious!  Tender pieces of chicken, carrots and raisins stuffed inside a buttery crust.  I can polish off about 75 of these during one sitting ;p

Luisa & Sons is a Pilipino bakeshop offering traditional cuisine from the homeland, both savory & sweet.

Fresh baked goods are prepared daily & gobbled up by the masses

Have a sweet tooth?  No problem!  Luisa & Sons offers delectable treats to satisfy your sugar fix

Besides the sweets & baked goods, savory dishes are available for purchase in the freezers and for pre-order food trays, such as sisig & dinuguan.  My family has often ordered a tray of pancit malabon (Pilipino noodle dish) & a box of empanadas for special occasions.  They're always a hit & nary a leftover afterwards.

Service has always been good.  I'm a regular, so the staff already knows they have to restock their supplies once I'm done shopping ;p

Parking is in the Unimart shopping plaza, shared with Milk & Honey, Azon & Canaan restaurants, among others.

What da bloody heck ya waitin for?  Go to Luisa & Sons Bakeshop already!

Highly recommend!

<Review>Whoa whoa whoa!

I found my go-to spot for CASSAVA CAKE. We devoured it!

In addition to CHEESE CROISSANT ROLLS (similar to Portos' Cheese Rolls but BETTER)

I also tried the Beef Empanada which was also delish since I love raisins in those!

Must come back for Siopao, Halo Halo, and turon!

The sign looks like Suisa & Son's which threw me off a bit, but right next to a super market and Milk & Honey!</Review><gmapID>0x80dd2da0558bc355:0xf7e3751ef5e18aff< /gmapID><date>1398761111768<//date>< Pictures>

< Review>
Horrible service, Make you wait to long and if your new here they get there regular customers before you. To be correct they signed in just like I did so there was no appointment for businesses all use that as an excuse I waited 1 1/2 hour patiently and will never return to "Quick Cutz" and will also not recommend this place to friends are family also not following CDC rules everyone sitting next to each other not  6ft apart and ain't wearing masks the two women workers the one up front by the sign up sheet and the one to the back on the far left...</Review>

I have been coming here for years. It's located on Shaw and Peach. Just right behind the Long Johns restaurant.Walking in you need to sign in. If you like a specific person than you need to write that in. I like Dee. But it's your decision, Andy,T are awesome as well. I don't know the others names but I know they are good. They are busy during the weekend. But have a TV to watch if your bored. I love that they play the foot ball games or baseball when games are on. In the slower afternoons you'll find soap operas on which is ok. A haircut now cost $18 and for me that's cutting my hair and a fade. They also razor fade, eyebrows, women's hair, face hair. Please tip if you go in, especially during these times.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80945c6760d821c1:0xcedea199994fb9dc</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been bringing my boys here for over 10 years. once I got upset because the person cutting my toddlers hair was being ruff with him and requested a different barber. I continued to go here because it’s convenient and they do a decent job but the female owner has held a grudge. She won’t take my boys when it is their turn and will move people in front of me and also talks about me in her language. I won’t be returning. While complaining to a friend about service, she told me that Barber shops should not even be operating right now. I don’t know if this is true but the waiting area was at full capacity< /review>

It was definitely quick but not the best hair cut I've had. One side was uneven and you could still see the lines</review>

This is where my husband and I go for him to get his hair cut and me to get my eyebrows done. We always ask for "T" she does a very good job cutting his hair. And on the majority knows just how I like my eyebrows done. Been going to her for a while😊< /review>

I love T!!! I have been coming here for 15 years for highlights and haircuts. I recommend her for men, women ,and children's haircuts. I get my hair bleached and it's not fried,  it's still very healthy. She does an awesome job with great prices. 😆< /text>

Cheap good and fast usually don't go in the same sentence when describing a business.  But for quick cuts that's exactly what you get.  Good haircut, at a cheap price, with fast service.</Review>

I asked for a hair style I even showed her a picture, but I got a completely different shorter cut. I kinda blame my self because I had my 8 month old with me in the chair and he was crying the whole time😒. But she was fast and I LOVE the style she did I wouldn't have ever tried it on my own but I love it.< /text>

So far I've been to this place 8-10 times having experienced 3 different barbers out of the 6 or so and have had OUTSTANDING service. I'm very particular about my haircuts and before this place would almost always personally fix my haircut once I get home. But this place is cheaply priced ($9-12 for me before tip, Fresno can be $16 for haircuts, I'm used to $10 back home), usually very little wait time, open 7 days a week. They take their time and deliver. Andy seems to be the most wanted barber and I have yet to have a cut from him but once more they all seem to be pretty awesome.<//Review>

Very rude and bad haircuts plus they are expensive just go to fade shop for 20$ if your looking for a serious haircut but if you don’t care about haircut/customer service then go here they are pretty expensive 14$< /text>

< Review>
I do not understand these reviews where customer says they cannot get a hold of Customer Service..I have dealt with them for years and their other company Hancock, has most of same items.
I am connected within 5 min every time and helpful Representatives have refunded every item I am not satisfied with. Also allowed me to Add on to a recently placed order ...they exchange an item for a new one too, never had to return anything.  I love this company for that reason an the products are usually 90% good quality.< /Review>

My opinion of Starcrest is very poor. My elderly mother has ordered from this company numerous times. At first there customer service was great but recently she placed an order and received all but one of her items. She has called the last two weeks and has been on hold at certain times for an hour. She finally gives up and hangs up. I have emailed them and never got a response. She does not have a computer so I went on the tracking web site that they advertise on the phone recording but cannot find an area to ask the status of her order.
I’m sure that Starcrest main customers are elderly and now I understand why.  At least where my mother is involved. They can take her money and don’t send her her items, cash her check and not bother sending her a refund.   Now we have been on hold trying to reach customer service for 10 minutes.
Again, my opinion and I have asked her not to order anything else from this company. She lives in a retirement village and I told her that she should let her neighbors know how she has been treated!!!</review>

I am very happy the way this company treats me. They are helpful when you have a question about a product and are willing to replace or refund a product that arrived damaged or defective . Customer service is pleasant and courteous.  With the pandemic,  orders arrive very slowly, but I  have to be patient!  And I LOVE  Cali !!!!!  If I had the money, I'd come back to  Cali. Thank you, Starcrest.< /review>

I ordered 3 men's shirts for my husband .all xl. It took forever to come and then one shirt was xl and 2 LG .I call for over a week and different time if day ,hold for hours and no one ever picks up. I emailed and no answer, I mailed packing slip with problem Inc, no answer . He loves the one shirt and would like the other two xl .but no  response so far. They need a better system of response. Like a call back system  because of being backed up. Help !  Product good but help system very bad.< /text>

< Review>
Stay away, bad management unsafe working environment. I feel bad for working for these people so long. COVID was the last straw, they did not care about our safety or let us work from home. I felt so bad about customers not getting their orders but we were being so overworked and forced to do overtime everyday, and we could still never catch up with call volume due to being understaffed and people quitting. Please dont work or order  here. i have found a better job in which I have already gotten a promotion and raise in a few months while i was never given a raise or given opportunities to succeed in my years at starcrest. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.</Review>

<text>Just received my first order and have already ordered again!  Everything came quickly and  was accurate.  Not sure why there are negative reviews , because we have spend nearly $200.00 and am pleased to be able to purchase unusual items at great prices.  If I have a problem, I will let you know!  Don't be concerned about having a problem with your order.  Sounds like disgruntled employees, not customers.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Starcrest has FEDEX as their shipping company. I work so I'm not home for the delivery. When I called FedEx they said I could pick up my package at FEDEX in a town 40 miles away. So far I have lost out on 2 separate orders and have yet to get my money back.< /Text>

< review>
I was hired in a supervisory role. VERY overworked, and under compensated. Workers under me were underpaid and forced to work overtime, or terminated. Even if your currently experiencing work related problems, avoid this place. It's basically a legal sweatshop. Worked with some really professional people at mid-Supervisor tier, but bosses higher up were incompetent, and ruled to an extent by fear and coersion. AVOID this place as a worker. They sell trinkets and mail order garbage. HUMAN HELL HOLE.</review>

< Review>
I've been ordering products from Starcrest for over a year, and am pleased with their service so far. The various products that I have ordered have been as advertised, and shipments arrive within a reasonable time. I also appreciate that Starcrest carries some items that I've not been able to find anywhere else.< /Review>

<text>Great products and have ordered many times. The only thing useless that I have ordered was the tape for mailing packages and give wrapping.  Terrible quality and useless. Had to throw out. Consider what all I have ordered that was a very small percentage of items purchased over the years.</text>< Date>

<text>Fun, useful things at inexpensive prices. I've not had any problems with them. They have a great set of pens that we love. We've ordered them twice now, and always grab a few extra things that are different than what you would find in the store. I like them. Don't know about these negative reviews.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<username>Letitia DenHartog<//username><review>Unique items, some of which I can't get anywhere else. You get what you pay for on some items, but when there has been an error, Starcrest always corrects it even when it's my fault. You can't beat the shipping, if you don't mind waiting.<//review><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I have been ordering from Starcreast for years and have never received a bad product. Items always arrive on time and in good shape.  Good prices and good products. I think people who give bad reviews do so because they think they are beining funny. Good company.</text>

Just rec'd my first order with this company spent $160. I'm afraid  of the electronics. Purchased a battery operated dentures  cleaner. It got hot  smoke was coming from bottom the batteries were melting
My husband burned his fingers trying to get the batteries out one of them was stuck. Soglad we caught it before it got fiery
Now I'm checking all the electronics we purchased . So disappointed not sure if I'll buy again<//Text>

These people are bad news. Not sure if it would do any good but the BBB should get Involved. These people take your money but you don't get what you paid for. I will burn my money first before I send them another penny. Come on Starcrest  ether your going to do this or not. I think the term is S--t or get off the pot. How many people are you going to screw over before you go under? I can speak for myself, you just lost a customer.< /text>

This was by far the most shady and scandalous company I've ever worked for.
I was recently employed here for about 14 months as a buyer secretary.
Being that there was so many negative points to this company, rather than describe, I'll list all that was wrong:
- Unpaid hours !!!!
- Unfair wages to all employees
- Unorganized/lack of communication as well
- Very poor managment
- Does not care about employees
- No empathy to personal life that may affect work
- Very shady and sneeky
- Scandalous ! ! ! ! !
- No possibility for advancement
- Uses people until they break down (I've seen it with 16 very good people I came to know during employment) then throws them out like trash
- Ignores even the slightest comment/recommendation/concern regarding workplace, etc.<//Text>

Horrible. Ordered over a month ago, 54$ worth of items. Nothing has arrived yet. Gave them my debit card information and the money was deducted from my account.  I called a few minutes ago and a very rude worker didn't help at all. I told her what happened and she said "You ordered January 30th and you're just calling us now?". She also said "I don't have your order in our records." BEFORE i told her my name or debit card number. I pointed this out to her and she said "Uh, your name is Virginia!"....my name is NOT Virginia. She then stated I needed proof that I made a purchase, and I asked for the company email. She then said "WE DON'T HAVE AN EMAIL!". Very bad customer service. Do not order from this company. It's a scam!< /Review>

This was the Worst Fast Food Experience ever! (I'm Black and this incident was racially charged.)
Me and my girlfriend walk in and sit down to read the menu, then IMMEDIATELY the Manager yells at us from across the room "If you're going to sit here, then go sit outside"
So I told said "Okay" and proceeded to look at the menu then she stared at us (and mind you an elderly lady walked in right before us and the manager only asked her one time if she was still looking at the menu, but the manager stared at us and asked us multiple times "Do you know what you want yet?" Clearly all of us were still looking at the menu deciding.
Now I fear SPIT or something more DISGUSTINGLY will be in my food IF I order again.

<Review>I love Del Taco the food is always fresh and its presentation is always the same .. However this being said the EMPLOYEES could brush up on their CSR skills. The Del Taco "Management Crew" are very rude and disrespectful they are insensitive to customers complaints about how the meal was bring made wrong.< /Review>< Resp>

At nearly 2.00 each, I got screwed. 2 crunchtados would have been great if they were placed in the box right side up, but with the facing down, they were a mess to eat. What a wast cif time and money. This place is inconsistent and troublesome. Need to find a better Del Taco.< /review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Went to pick up an order, and drive thru was packed, so I decided to go in. Well now I know why Drive thru is backed up. You have an employee on his phone standing next to his register. I walked in stood there for a moment. When one of the runners acknowledged me then, he turned around and put his phone away. Then once he realized I was just picking up, turned sat back down on the counter and pulled out his phone. Then I watched as another customer come in to complain and stood behind him for a bit before getting even more agitated, and have to get his attention so he can put his phone away and actually help him. So Unprofessional to be on your phone at work, and also to keep your back to the lobby when the doors are unlocked.</Review>

I prefer Del Taco over Taco Bell. Their menu is so much better, yet their prices are equal. Plus they have specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays after 3:00 PM!!<//review>

I don't really care for this Del Taco.  Service in the drive thru is really slow even when no one is in line.</review>

The staff in the front tends to get my order wrong, So I don’t recommend ordering any specific burrito. I only go for the beyond avocado tacos so that way my order does not end up being messed up. Highly recommend the manager come and straighten this location out, it was better before.</text>

< Review>
Not sure what was going on will Del Taco on this day but service was super slow, took almost45 minutes to order and receive our food. Not sure what the staff was doing but you had one worker on the phone just chatting away. Then the woman at the window giving attitude because I told her we were missing a burger. She seemed frustrated, who knows if the restaurant is suffering because of poor management and staff not properly trained. I hope today was a fluke. Maybe I'll try again. No not really. Also fries were cold in the inside but warm in the outside. Got my order wrong too.< /Review>

Poor service
The store manager Carmen who can’t even speak English or Spanish properly is so ghetto and to top it off has a horrible arrogant attitude. She fails to understand that it is because of US !!! She has a job!

This lady has no right to mistreat and hang up on customers and insult them. We are there to pay for a service! We are not there to get free food or poor service after paying for our food.

The ladies at the swap meet are way more respectful that the trashy people they have as managers at that location. Never again!<//text>

No seating for my weary bones in side. The quesadilla had way too much grease. And the burrito was unexpectedly very spicy. Other than that, it was fairly pleasant with the employees and we enjoyed ourselves. We found seating outside. We got to feed the birds. Birds like spicy burritos. Lol 😆 The tacos were great.<//review>

It's not the best Del Taco I've been to, but it's still good food! I don't go through the drive thru because it's always always always busy! If you go in it's usually not too busy. Keep in mind there's only one register though. The manager is nice and the fries are always fresh! The tables are a little dirty and the floor could use a good deep cleaning but it's okay. I like coming here because they are fast and get your food to you quickly</text>

<Review>The store was nice and clean. Maria at the register was quick and efficient with taking down my order accurately (the receipt said Daniela but I was just going by name tags). My burritos and tacos came out to order fast and they were delicious! Would definitely come to this Del Taco again soon 😊 Thank you guys for the great service and quality dining!<//Review><user_name>Raymond Ballesteros (kroq1120)< /user_name>< rating>

For not being very busy, the service was slow. I had the wet burrito plate and the rice and beans were blah and dry. Usually better.<//review>

A lot of the low level, value meals lack. You have to throw down some salsa to get any zing. This chain had bland flavors and really is an overpriced rip off. Decent cheese quesadilla but for $3? I would only eat here if completely desperate or run out of napkins in my car. Close the doors.<//Text>

This young man was quite a gentleman, he took the time to walk my elderly mother into the hospital on a completely voluntary basis. He even refused to accept a tip from my mom as he could tell she's on a fixed budget. Very commendable character. Truly an asset to your organization and an exceptional work ethic.  Precisely the type of worker you should strive to retain.

The noachis are delicious better than Taco Bell if we are being honest , they use American cheese rather than the yellow cheese which makes a difference< /Text>< Pics>

I've been going there for many years, I love the turkey crispy tacos but today it was terrible!,  I ordered 3 crispy tacos, 3 were broken,  2 were missing meat  and lettuce, is the 1st time I get this garbage, they have different manager and obviously employees don't have consideration for customers and prepare the food in a very sloppy way. Shame on the manager ! I tried to call  Del Taco and the telephone line was busy forever!.  I'm so disappointed!</text>

This is strictly about the drive thru. Less than half the time I go through it, I'll get through like a normal drive thru would work. The majority of the time, I get a woman who holds you at the speaker to repeat herself 10 times and will tell you to "hold on", while she leaves for 5 minutes. I'm guessing she holds you at the speaker so that you're time at the window is quick. I'm guessing there's a timer inside and the faster they get you through the window, the better.

Today is pouring raining and I'm sitting at the speaker while the inside of my car is being filled with water and she keeps leaving the speaker< /review>

We are frequent customers of DT - it's location is walking distance from home & school, so the kids often grab food here. Food is tasty but still fast food. We do like that they will customize just about anything they offer, if you ask.<//Review>

I went thru drive and the young lady was very nice , I highly recommend the cheeseburger with fries believe when I say they are better than a Mccdouble !! The cheese melts in your mouth and it tastes very different . The fries are very different from the typical fries we usually get! The noachis are delicious better than Taco Bell if we are being honest , they use American cheese rather than the yellow cheese which makes a difference</Text>

<review>I used the drive thru, ordered a #2, beef burrito with beans, fries and a drink. The burrito was mostly or all beans, the Sprite was carbonated water, and the fries were ok.
I won't be going back anytime soon. Definitely not worth the expensive price.< /review>< GmapID>

When you walk in the roof is leaking water so you can only sit in half the area.  When I got my fries I found pieces of plastic in it.  They apologized and refunded me.< /Text>

I love their fries!  I get the kids meal for the kids and ok,  for me too.  Lol Just because it perfectly comes with everything I need... Cheese quesadilla,  crinkle cut fries,  drink,  and yeah the kids get the toy.  😁 No,  but really they are a great place.  Even gave me a yummy milk shake free on my birthday!</Review>

I like Del Taco but today I ordered the triple chicken box and up sized the fries too a large and when I get home, which isn't close, they were the normal small size.</text>

< Review>
Tonight was really bad which is very unusual for this location. The tostada shells where stale and nasty. The salsa that Congress on the crunchdadas tasted funny and old sorry Del Taco this is usually my favorite location but tonight was not so good< /Review>

The experience was horrible. I order food and it was WORNG... then I go back to make it over and they made it WRONG again. They don't pay attention to what they see on the screen or what they are doing!!!!! I also while standing there watched the older women working there get the order wrong while there boss was standing never. PLZ DON'T GO HERE ITS HORRIBLE. I COULD OF WENT TO MC DONALDS OR SOME WHERE ELSE IF I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS. AND I NORMALLY LOVE DEL TACO I'LL GO OUT MY WAY TO LA THE. GO TO THE ONE IN DOWNEY. I'M SO MAD AND STILL HUNGRY THIS IS RIDICULOUS MONEY WAISTED AND DEFINITELY GOING IN THE TRASH!!!!!</text>
