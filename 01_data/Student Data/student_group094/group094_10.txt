I've had the pleasure of working with Custom Fit and some of their trainers, not as a client, but as a videographer and photographer for their training and nutrition programs. Not only is their facility a bright, beautiful space to work in, CF has also shown a dedication to cleanliness and the safety of all who enter throughout the pandemic, which I was able to witness firsthand. The staff are knowledgeable, motivational, and fun people to be around and I would definitely recommend CF as a place to work out if you live or work in the area.< /Review>

Incredible experience with Custom Fit - Evan is a world-class trainer with (as the name suggests) highly customized workouts catered to your requests and varied each session. Facilities are new, clean, and equipment is the same with a number of state of the art pieces. Environment is very comfortable for all experience levels. Can't recommend Custom Fit enough!</text>

{'time': 1625111594457, 'text': 'Hi Travis,\n\nGreat to e-meet you. It appears we’ve never met nor have you been a client of our studio so it’s unfortunate we have to connect for the first time under these circumstances. As a local, family-run business we take our reputation very seriously and after being closed for over a year due to COVID, and only recently reopening at a limited capacity, it’s very disheartening to read your review of our personal training and nutrition studio.\n\nWe strive to be the best neighbors possible and have completed some acoustic testing to mitigate any vibrations or noise emanating from our studio. We do not intentionally drop weights (no olympic lifting) and do not do any exercises or play music that produce vibrations. Clients do accidentally drop weights from time to time so this could be the case here but without any context (time of day, what you heard, etc) of your review, it’s impossible to determine if this was caused by us. Being centrally located on Market St also means there are various noises and vibrations such as construction, sirens, cable cars, street people, etc. that could be the source of the disturbance.  However, if we did disturb you, I truly apologize, and I want to do everything I can to prevent it from happening again so please reach out at your earliest convenience so we can communicate in-person and solve this.\n\nI hope you have a happy and healthy 2021.\n\nThank you.'}<//response>

This studio makes so much noise when they slam weights down. Shakes the whole building. Selfish people only think about their own needs.</review>

<date>1619495225059<//date><rating>5<//rating><Text>It has been such a pleasure to work with Evan at Custom Fit! First of all the facility is gorgeous, and very well-equipped. I love the clean, modern, and alive vibes of the space, with lots of plants, and earthy design accents like bamboo floors and astroturf. Makes working out more pleasant for me when I’m doing it in a beautiful (and spotless!) space.

Evan is also incredibly professional and really knows his stuff in terms of how to address each individual’s body differently. Custom Fit is a perfect name since I really feel like he customizes an exercise plan unique to me. We spent the entire first session just assessing my movement habits and figuring out where I needed work. He identified several asymmetries right away and gave me exercises and stretches that helped SO much! I also really appreciate the added nutrition piece that he and his colleagues offer. As a fellow healthcare professional, I know first-hand how crucial proper nutrition is, and agree that true fitness is far more than just working out.

If you’re looking for help with your fitness, give Evan a call! Highly recommended!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Custom fit has changed my life and my body! Eric is genuinely concerned about my fitness goals and makes sure that every workout is different from the last. You are sure to get a great workout and feel a part of something bigger than yourself. I am grateful for Eric's focus on what my needs are and sets up the next workout to achieve my goals.

<UserId.>114777121983470674731<//UserId.><Text>I go to Custom Fit for both the "Personal Training" and the "Nutrition" and they both get a resounding 5 stars from me.

Nutrition:
I work with Tarah Venn, who is an incredibly thoughtful and adept nutritionist and has already helped me make more progress in the 2 months I've been working with her than I made in the last 2 years on my own. She promotes long-term habits as opposed to "quick tips" to reach goals quickly. If you're interested in getting some help to reach your dietary goals, I couldn't recommend her more highly.

Personal Training:
I work with Kendra Africa, who has been a perfect match for me in terms of personal training. She's customized all of my workouts to optimize strengthening muscles where I've long had weaknesses. I also have dealt with multiple knee injuries and Kendra has been so helpful finding ways to prevent future injuries. She clearly has a vested interest in my success and that's really awesome.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I’ve worked with personal trainer Charles Armstrong for over 3 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I've made about my personal health and well-being.

His great skills in personal training honed with years of experience and education make for great workout sessions. Charles pushes me to constantly challenge myself and I have definitely seen results in my physical (and mental!) health.

A trainer and client have to be a good fit. One of the main reasons Charles and work well together is that I trust him. He is an all-around great person to be around. He is always positive, personable and reliable.

I've gone from never working out (before I worked with Charles) to now working out 2 to 3 times a week with him. I can be very unmotivated to work-out, but he constantly changes-up my routine so that I don't get bored and stay motivated. He constantly watches my form and reminds me of any corrections I need to make.

I also really enjoy training at Custom Fit - the people are friendly and the space works well for individual training sessions. The location works well for me too< /Review>< pictures>

Really great facilities & trainers. Katie is amazing. She is knowledgeable, non-judgemental, and motivating. She is there for you outside of sessions and does her best to change the way you think about fitness. When I started with Katie, all i cared about was what I saw on the scale. I rarely did any strength training and spent the last couple of years in grad school without even stepping foot in a gym. With her help & coaching, I feel myself improving with every workout and learning to love my body and its abilities more. Highly recommend.< /Text>

<text>I have been training with Evan since 2015 at another studio prior to Custom Fit.  When Evan opened Custom Fit, I followed him.  Why?  As a plus size woman,  being comfortable with my trainer is important to me.  Evan is non-judgemental, easy-going and keeps me motivated by making each training session unique so it is never dull.  He is challenging but never to the point where I feel discourage and overwhelmed.  I often joke with him and tell him "I am playing ball with the big boys now" bring it on!  because he makes me feel like I am capable of doing anything and that is very important because it keeps me going!!  I train now once a week with Evan and twice with Allen-another extraordinary motivator!  I was reluctant to train with Allen because I was so use to training with Evan three times a week but Allen has completely won me over!  Allen's dedication to my success has helped me stay focus.  He is driven, passionate and does not deviate- it is all about staying focus, having control and breathing properly.  When he talks about his own personal workouts and how great he feels, he lights up! and as a result it motivates me to continue pushing myself even harder.  Now that is what training is all about!  Having the desire to take it to the next level!!! Having both Evan and Allen as my personal trainers,  I know that 2020 is the year that I will make drastic changes for a better and healthier self.< /text>< pics>

I train at Custom Fit with Katie Kroshka and I absolutely love it. Even when she's pushing me, muscles burning, lungs yelling at me and I feel like I can't do another more rep, I'm still having a blast. And with a smile from Katie and encouragement I'm able to finish the set. She literally lights up like a Christmas tree when she's proud and you've done well. She takes pride in her work and truly loves what she does. I think there needs to be a good balance between serious focus and having fun. Katie has found this balance and shares it with me and I can't thank her enough. Her knowledge is deep and sometimes, I don't even notice we've had a session until the next day. She makes it easy and challenging at the same time. Wizardry.

The gym itself is clean, comfortable, and has all the tools we need for whatever we're focusing on that day. The other trainers are respectful and kind and you don't even notice anyone else in the building. Everyone is focused on what they're doing and I like that. I'm a fan of privacy, especially when it comes to self improvement. So feeling comfortable in this professional space is a determining factor in me coming back to Custom Fit time and time again. If the gym seems like a scary place to you, or you're a seasoned fitness pro, Katie and Custom Fit will help you ease those fears or meet those goals. Thank you!< /Review>

<Review>I signed up to Custom Fit 4 months ago as a first-timer to Personal Training, I am absolutely delighted with the experience and the results. Evan conducted an initial consultation and assigned me to Jackie - a calm, patient and good-humored trainer. Each session was unique and challenging. Never boring. The gyms are spotless and the equipment well maintained. In parallel I consulted with nutritionist - Marissa, who offered pragmatic tips on dietary improvements without compromising on quantity, flavor or convenience. Highly recommended.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Awesome experience working with Evan & team at Custom Fit SF for partner training.  The gym is conveniently located, clean, well-organized and super functional for strength and circuit workouts.  Lots of fun equipment to mix up workouts (sled, battle ropes, kettlebells, etc.) and for recovery (massage guns, foam rollers, etc.).  The vibe is friendly and unpretentious and even at peak hours the gym is never over-crowded.  Our trainer, Lucia, was extremely professional, easy to communicate with, and planned fun, challenging workouts.  The included nutritional advice and recipes was also a huge additional value!  Highly recommended, would gladly train here again in the future.<//text><Response>None< /Response><Rating>5< /Rating><username>James Honsa< /username>< Time>

<review>Initially drawn to Custom Fit because it's so close to home and convenient. Keep coming back because the workouts are awesome - dynamic, never boring or repetitive, and challenging (thanks, Jackie!). Definitely workout harder than if I were to do it on my own. Added bonus: large, clean space. Never crowded. Great package deals.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I wanted to get into shape before the big day and knew I needed help doing it. From the get-go, Evan took the time to understand my goals and assess the shape I was in. He is professional and articulate which makes it easy to understand the various routines sets out for you.

I was assigned to Scott as my trainer in the beginning; however, due to my schedule with work Evan moved me over to Keith after a few sessions. Both Scott and Keith were great! Energetic and encouraging. Keith took the time to get to know me and clearly outlined the various exercises each and every session. He also kept it ever-changing, working different muscle groups while maintaining a focus on my core as that is what I wanted to see changed for my wedding.

My husband said I looked amazing and I felt great! I attribute Custom Fit to this and the amazing operation they have. It's a beautiful, clean gym with a variety of equipment. I highly recommend! Only thing to note, keep in mind it's a tad expensive--but most personal trainers are.<//Review>< pics>

This review is long overdue. I have been working out with the team at custom fit for about a year now, and like all the other reviews on here could not be more happy with it. Worked with a variety of trainers any would be a great choice.
Space is very well kept up, AC so its never to hot and very clean. I have now long considered this a must when looking over a budget, I would do yourself and your body the favor of trying it out.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I’ve had a great experience at Custom Fit. I’m an older guy, hadn’t worked out in several years, and was hesitant to go to a typical gym. Then I heard about Custom Fit. Evan, the owner, matched me with a talented trainer, Dennis, who knows a ton about diet, exercise and physiology in general. Dennis eased me into a routine, always being sensitive of my limits and injuries. (I hurt my lower back running a 10k a few months back.) To make a long story short, over the course of six months, I’ve lost 25 pounds and three pants sizes. My mood and self-confidence have soared. And it’s all thanks to Custom Fit.</text>< pictures>

Working out at Custom Fit has been such a great experience! I've been working out with Scott for over a year now and before I started training with him, I maybe went to the gym a few times a month and ate poorly. In addition to having amazing workout sessions with Scott (and a few times with Evan), they've given me advice about nutrition which has really helped, and I'm now in the best shape of my life. Would totally recommend Custom Fit to anyone looking for a trainer!</Review>

<Text>I don't think of myself as a person who would join a gym but at 67 I wanted to get in shape and trade-in some fat for muscle. I wanted to change my diet as well. You can find all of these services at Custom Fit. In just a short amount of time I have lost about 25lbs. and I always walk out of the place feeling stronger and having more energy then when I walked in.  Scott is  also working with me to strengthen muscle around some old injuries so I won't need surgery and it's working.  Scott is a great personal trainer who listen to my needs and customizes routines which I can work on both at the studio and at home. All of the trainer seem to support one another so the customer feels both the personal touch and a team support to each person they work with.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I've never been to a gym like this one, I actually didn't even know they existed before. I usually walk by on my way to work and noticed how cool it looked so after checking out the website I decided to give personal training a try. I initially met with Evan for the first session and decided to give a two trainers a try, one each per week. This is great for me as they both are very knowledgable and I have more scheduling flexibility (I travel to the south a lot). It's been a few months now and I'm making great progresses for a 60 yr old and doing things I never though possible. I'm now even considering meeting with their nutritionist to help with my diet. Would recommend 100% for anyone looking to improve their fitness in a professional atmosphere.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I do really enjoy working out at this gym. Even when it is busy with people working on their fitness, it is never crowded and never feel judged. They have personal training and nutrition advice that you can get, so it is one of the best ways for me to address some of the gaps in my knowledge. More than anything, having someone help you with accountability is huge.<//Review><time>1555953403743</time><rating>5<//rating>< Resp>

This review is about Nutrition planning with Marissa at Custom Fit. She had a thorough screen of my diet and provided helpful meal planning that was manageable on several fronts: the recipes were quick, simple and delicious. I also like that ingredients crossed over from one recipe to another so there was virtually no waste. I really liked the make-ahead meals with variations that meant I had snacks and/or breakfast on the go. I hate throwing food away and feel guilty when I buy an ingredient I am unlikely to use again that goes to waste so this aligned really well with Marissa's suggested recipes.<//Text>

I'v been training with Milad at Custom Fit for 8 months. If you have a goal and you take nutrition seriously you can get amazing results. I was able to lose 2 pounds a week when I had a weight loss goal. Now I have a strength goal and am gaining 2.5 lbs of muscle a month. The workouts are effective, focused and aligned with the goals that you have.<//Review>

I’ve worked with two trainers here so far and now I’ve decided to take it to the next level with my nutrition and about a month ago signed up with Marissa. The training + the recipes and meal ideas are fantastic and I feel great. They are customized to fit your cooking skillz, tastes and anything else you want (protein, veggies, etc.) Would definitely recommend Custom Fit if you’re looking for a super clean fitness space, a team (or just one…) of great personal trainers to get you in shape or a nutritionist to help with your diet!!< /Review><username>Barry Schneider< /username>< user_id>

Have been coming here for almost a year and the professional, yet laid back atmosphere makes it an absolute pleasure. Evan was extremely helpful at building a tailored work out plan and Keith does an excellent job executing it every week for me. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to get into better shape!</review>

Highly recommend this studio. I worked with Keith for 30 sessions - I loved working with him and I'm so pleased with my results. The folks here are friendly, knowledgable, and very thoughtful in their approach. The equipment is new, the space is clean, and the music is on point. The location is also very convenient.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I've been working out with Milad for 6 months now, and the results have been fantastic. I started working out with Milad to get ready for my wedding, but I was so happy with my results that I kept going for another two months. Milad is a great trainer with a ton of experience, but he also makes the workouts fun and tailors them to your specific needs. No two sessions are ever the same, which keeps things interesting. If you're in pain or uncomfortable, Milad knows exactly the right stretch or modification to help. I could not recommend a better trainer!

Additionally, Custom Fit is a great gym. The facilities are clean and spacious, and the equipment is state of the art. Everyone here is friendly and focused on their own goals which makes this a comfortable and supportive environment to sweat in.< /review><gmap_id>0x808580a0194d2cb5:0xfb26f15dc1e052b7</gmap_id><response>None</response>< Pictures>

Beautiful space. Top notch amenities. This is the place to work out if you're after results in personal training. Evan assessed my posture and movement and designed stretching and strengthening exercise program to address my goals and challenges. I do Pilates and Redcord suspension exercises three times a week and was looking for something to compliment my routine. I highly recommend both Evan and Custom Fit.</Text>

Evan is by far the best personal trainer I've seen since living in SF. I've been training with him since he coached at the olympic club and now that he offers full nutritionist services I have a fully tailored health and fitness experience.  Would recommend for anyone who needs a plug and play personal trainer with a great attitude and tons of experience.</Review>

I was about a year out from rotator cuff surgery, and Milad customized our sessions to ensure that I got the results I wanted without re-injuring myself.

<Text>I've now been working out with Scott once a week for the past several months (previous trainer Summer moved away – I've been working out at Custom Fit for over a year). Scott is awesome to train with, and I wake up on Monday mornings pumped to start my week with a fun, challenging, exhausting but energizing workout. Every single workout is different and new, but for me they always includes cardio, strength training, core workouts (killer), balance, and boxing (my favorite!! - Scott trained as a boxer for years so he's ridic and even though he's clearly going easy on me, it doesn't *feel* like he is, haha).

The new thing I've noticed, too, is that trying new routines with Scott makes me want to keep it up and try things at my regular gym the rest of the week. The other trainers and clients are awesome at coordinating space with each other, it never feels crowded, is always bright and sunny, and clients are all ages and shapes and fitness levels which I absolutely love because the gym feels inclusive but everyone is motivated and training hard. If I could budget to start every morning working out with Scott at Custom Fit, I totally would!<//Text>< pictures>

Let me start off by telling you how NICE this studio is. Beautiful, bright, airy, clean, sleek, simple, welcoming, and fully-equipped. I've been lifting weights, taking classes, and playing sports (including high-level and very competitive) for much of my life, and Custom Fit stands out and stands apart from the many, many places I've exercised. It's a place that makes you want to work hard and do a few extra reps, just because it's such a great environment.

From the moment you walk in the door, Evan and Marissa and their staff are friendly, genuine, low-key, extremely knowledgable, and highly professional. Don't let the laid back demeanor fool you, though; These are people who are serious in their quest to provide the full, personalized health experience for the widest possible range of people. Whether you're training for something specific, or re-evaluating your exercise routine, or just needing a little help, or changing your whole life around, this is the place.

It is immediately evident that the trainers are extremely knowledgeable about fitness, nutrition (especially Marissa, what a gem), and general healthy lifestyle choices. They work together with each client (and with each other) to create a personalized, informative, understandable, and achievable set of goals, and then commit themselves to helping each person achieve them. I can't say enough good about the stuff here. They're the best I've found, hands down.

I also love that the studio is really clean (the complete opposite of those grungy training studios and gyms that are supposed to be "authentic," but are actually just gross). Floors, ceilings, and everything in between is state of the art, functions perfectly, and is extremely well-maintained. The bathroom and shower are excellent. The equipment includes some things you're probably familiar with, and some things you probably aren't; the trainers here are experts in using it all in creative ways to help each person make the most of their training experience.

Lastly, just some little things that especially stand out: they'll wash your gym clothes for you! No more sweaty clothes sitting in your car while you're at work all day. So underrated, and a great perk. Also, great music on a real stereo system! None of the standard box-gym garbage played on tinny little speakers. As you can tell, I'm a big fan of SF's newest (and by far nicest) personal training studio. It's the total package, and more. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!< /Text>

This is South Pasadena not Compton people we can do better than this!

<Text>This is my go-to for any hankering I have, the plates are well portioned and the service is always excellent, and I love the atmosphere. Dining in from what I remember was extremely pleasant too, with a lot of seating options and a great location, it's easily a 5 star from me.</Text><response>None<//response><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

<Review>This is the first time I've ordered online and my food wasn't waiting for me when i arrived. In fact, i waited 10 minutes for them to get me my single gyro wrap. Not a huge deal but if it's going to be delayed the website ordering system and or email confirmation should reflect.<//Review>< Pictures>

I like the food, what I don't like is the service.  Twice I've ordered online and chosen a pickup time (20-25 minutes).  Each time the food was not ready when I arrived.  The last time (Saturday night), they didn't even have my order.   Why choose a pickup time if they can't have the food ready?  There were only 3 staff on a very busy Saturday night, so where is the owner or his family to pitch in and help out?   Right now it's mostly takeout, so Nick, get your act together.</Text>

<Text>Very disappointed at the quality of the food. We got 3 gyro and 1 burger. Only one of the gyros had a decent amount of feta cheese and thequality of lamb/beef tasted cheap. The baklava was sugary sweet when it is usually syrup sweet. I have also never had to use a knife to cut baklava. Spent almost $100 definitely not worth it.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Nick the Greek has great and quick Greek food that combines traditional dishes like Gyros with American ones like fries (Greek fries). I had the beef/lamb gyro, and although simple, it was delicious. For only $9.95, the meal was a very filling lunch that was fast. My order came out within 10 minutes and it was gone in five. This is a must have for people who stop by in Santa Cruz or just the bay area in general as I have seen other cities with them. Additionally, Nick the Greek was very spacious providing ample room for six feet. Along with this, staff wore masks and there were hand washing and sanitizing stations.</Review>

Loved them forever until:  I decided to order some food for Myself, after delivering for Grubhub and Doordash for 1 1/2 years.  After a shift I ordered, waited 15 minutes, was told to ask for. Industrial discount by worker I have known 7 months from there.  Brought $10.37. It was $11.42. HE NEW GIRL SAID NO DISCOUNT!   SO, I DECIDED, THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SANDWICH AND I WILL NEVER, EVER DELIVER FIR THEM AGAIN! PERIOD!  SHE WAS SO SATISFIED WHEN I TOLD HER THAT. LIKE, NO BIG DEAL!  LIKE ...I WAS NOTHING!   HU!  MEANWHILE, IT IS SUNDAY AFTER MY SHIFT N I AM STARVING!   THANKS ALOT NEW GIRL! YOU ARE REALLY LAME!  YOU MESSED IT UP FOR YOURSELF AND ME. I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY.</text>

If I could possibly give a half star  I would, good food, bad service. I ordered a combo special through grub hub app for my son who loves thier gyros... when my husband went in to pick up order( they seemed busy, was quite a few people in lobby waiting for orders), he was told quickly by cashier that there was no order under our name, I know I ordered because my card was charged, my husband asked for the manager,  he then says he doesn't have the order either...after my husband running back and forth, he says he found the order. And that they don't use that  company anymore..?! I know I'm not the only one who uses Grubhub to order stuff ..and he wanted his money...
At that point we just wanted our food so we can go..finally he said he would give us our order and try to collect money from company. My card is still pending and hoping that the store gets thier money and a new cashier to be more nice and accommodating to customers who are just trying to get their food..< /Review>

Tasty! Delicious! Eating here for the first time. Thanks to Covid, they got takeout and it couldn't have been smoother or quicker. I called in my order and by the time I got there, it was ready for me. Terrific set up for the times. Hand sanitizer by all entrances, telling patrons to use it and, of course, masks when entering. On to the good part now: the food. They were SOOO delicious beef/lamb gyros. I also ordered a side to go with the spicy yogurt sauce. I might add a terrific addition. We are going to be back for sure!< /Review>

Pretty damn good. Was in Greece around 2 years ago and it's spot on. Beer is pricey, but everything else reasonably priced.  We had the Lamb gyro, greek salad and Nick's Fries rounded out with 2 ciders. Get some Baklava while eating outside during this covid.< /review>

I was a bit put off by the numerous tables needing wiped off, but the place different seem overall dirty. We enjoyed our wraps, but the 1st round of fries were cold. I appreciated they were quick to apologize and correct it with fresh hot delicious garlic fries. The taziki sauce wasn't the best I've had, a bit thick and pasty, but not the worst. The gyro wrap was absolutely fresh and perfect. We would eat there again.< /text>

Some great Greek eats. Their beef/lamb gyro has some good flavor and their creamy sauce is excellent. Service was quick too, even on opening day midway through the lunch rush. Surprisingly busy too given the place didn’t even advertise their existence much.

The portion-size of their Gyro-Fries Combo is equitable with that of Five Guys’ Cheeseburger and (smallest) Fries Combo.</review>

I've tried all the meats and don't really like them but the falafel is always good. Maybe I've just gotten unlucky with the meats but they've always been dry or unpleasant. The baklava is sooo good def recommend. Idk if this is authentic, it's more of a chain style fast food style Mediterranean but it's still super good. The fries are usually good too. I like the spicy yogurt sauce and usually get an extra one on the side.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Wildly inconsistent. 50.00 for a dinner for a family of four should be hot, out together correctly and come with everything that was ordered.  That has not been the case on two occasions at the Santa Cruz location.  Just check your order to make sure it is correct don’t trust the packaging.</Text>

I’m so happy to have a new Greek restaurant in town. A no frills approach to Greek food. Keeping it simple and tasty. These guys know what they are doing. Their food is delicious!

Service is friendly and quick. Make your order and choose a table to eat in or get your food to go and head to Abbot square or any other spot you like.

So far I’ve tried the chicken gyro, falafel bowl and Greek fries. Everything was really tasteful, but my favorite was the falafel bowl. Amazing!!</review>

It was my first time having Greek food and I loved it. The price was great too. I had the chicken gyro with garlic fries and a drink for around $15. Definitely recommend.  The interior of the restaurant was very nice too. They have music playing and TVs to watch. Overall the place and food is great.<//review>

Never was a customer never will be. My 7 year old son went in there on his own to use the restroom. And they told him no, if he wasn't a customer. This never happened  before nowhere, who says this to a child that needs to use the restroom?</Review>

Dirty tables and floors. Paid for food for my family only to watch order after order come out that belonged to people who came AFTER we ordered. Finally got our food and the gyro salad tasted like nothing but oil and salt. My sons French fries were the best tasting thing out of all we ordered, FRENCH FRIES! I regret coming here.< /text>

Not bad for a chain Mediterranean place.   Not really authentic, but decent falafel, gyro, etc.   I realize these foods vary a lot from Greece to Syria to other such...<//Review>

<text>I just had a chance to try the beef and lamb gyro wrap, it was filled with so much flavor. I love how the restaurant looks nice and modern. I was able to order my food in 2 minutes and have it served to me within about less than 7 minutes. I will definitely try exploring the menu next time and recommending it to my friends</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I actually really liked the Sunnyvale location of Nick's.  The food was fresh, servings large and the prices seemed reasonable.

This location our food was cold and the fries were overcooked and cold. An early problem we had hoped they had worked out.

I kept looking at their food prep video repeating over and over in front of me and thinking "I want THAT!"...not what I was served.  Those fries looked like what I got in Sunnyvale.

Music in the restaurant was really loud and pretty much precluded conversation.

Disappointed.<//Review>

Very good food. Nick's fries are very tasty and the bowl is a good option. Gyro meat is fresh and staff is very friendly. Highly recommend when in Santa Cruz!</text>

Food is really good, we ordered both the beef/lamb and the pork belly gyro, both really tasty! great value and good proportions. The only thing I'd add is to have extra tzatziki to serve in a cup for the food.

We also liked the place is clean and with plenty of space, there are high chairs for kids as well!

EDIT: They are tzatziki cups upon request<//text>

<review>As someone who loves Greek and Armenian Nick does very well for flavor and portion. What's is lacking are good tahini and garlic sauces for their chicken.  Ask for the chicken with the mustard sauce on the side, Nick's mustard is an unfortunate sugary mustard which tastes like ketchup without the tomato.</review>< GmapID>

Did not get a sandwich, just cut up meat and little triangles of pita bread. Salad was the worst Greek salad I have ever gotten, no Greek Olive, two little pieces of tomato, two little slivers of onion, and a whole lot of lettuce, and i have no idea what the dressing was but was not a Greek dressing I am aware of.

< Review>
For my first time, Nick the Greek was fairly disappointing. We were here for the beginning of lunchtime and I expected everything to be cooked to order. Instead the fries were stale and dry. The feta cheese was not enough to make the Greek Fries worth the money.

For those of us that ordered meat, it was not the most pleasant experience, in that it lacked flavor, and it tasted a day old. When it came to the rice, it was crunchy, thus underdone.

We had researched the restaurant online. Watched some amazing videos of how the food is prepared and ultimately, we found ourselves disappointed in the quality of the food.< /Review>

<Review>I loved the food, the falafel bowl was delicious.
I went for my first time on a day they had a test kitchen going, before the grand opening. I never felt like it was a practice run, they we're really quick, had friendly service, nice/clean space and great food! If the quality stays the same then I'll be back!< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Friendly service, nice clean open floor plan and a wonderful addition to the downtown community. I hat the Chicken Souvlaki plate with pita bread and I thought it was very refreshing and tasty. The mustard sauce complimented the chicken and the rest of the ingredients.

< Review>
Hands down the best Greek food in Santa Cruz. My wife and I ordered a couple of times through DoorDash and it always seems to arrive lukewarm. We remarked both times that we should try to go to the restaurant one time. I'm glad we did. It is so much better fresh out of the kitchen. I had the Chicken Souvlaki salad and my wife had the Falafel Bowl. Both were delicious. They need to work on delivery times, but the food in house is great.<//Review>

Went there twice,  ordering chicken slouvaki one time and just chicken skewers the other.  Both times I found the chicken pieces to be full of fat and gristle, and not made from just chicken breast as I requested.  Will never go back there!!</review>

The Customer service was on point I loved talking to Faith and Sarah they were very nice and got me to save some money with the student discount (package). Also Aspen did a great job on my eyebrows 😁👍. And don't forget to get your first free wax! Refer me and help a guy out. 😂</Text>

I got a Brazilian and my legs waxed by Shayna!! She was amazing! So kind, informative, funny, kept the conversation going. Made me feel so comfortable. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is because there were no chairs or anywhere to sit while you waited for your appointment. (Not sure if that was due to COVID)< /text>< Rating>

<text>Today I decided to visit European Wax Center because I am new to the area and I have always had a good experience with the waxing services from other European Wax Center facilities. However, I will not be returning to this particular facility after the experience I had today. I believe my estheticians name was Aspen. I specifically asked for just a simple clean up and I stated that I would like to keep my eyebrows thick. She left my eyebrows completely uneven and extremely thin. I did not mention anything about my dissatisfaction to her because I did not trust her to do a good job at modifying my eyebrows after the work she had produced. Typically, I never fill in my eyebrows but after today I had to go out and by a product in order to fill in my current asymmetrical eyebrows. I am unhappy, because of this visit I had to go out and buy an additional product for something I originally did not need.< /text>< pics>

I went here in preparation for my wedding (super fun times) and I got waxed for the first time. The girl that did my wax, Amara, was incredibly nice and talked to me the entire time because she knew I was uncomfortable (it being my first time and all hahaha) but it seriously helped me keep my mind off of what she was doing and lemme tell you it looked GREAT. I def recommend.</review>

Loved it! The minute you walk in the staff is super friendly. The place is super clean. Super helpful and free eyebrow wax for first visit! Plus the wax they use is less harsh than most and doesn't hurt as much. Definitely worth it!</review>

<review>I love this place everyone is so nice and friendly and they work with you if your running a bit late or need to change days or a walk in depending on what it is but very flexible. They call you to remind you of the appointment you schedule and they are open 7 days a week so awesome also, very clean and always smells good in there, I was so excited I was calling around called 3 or 4 places before I called them I asked if they could fit me in today because it was around Valentine's day and I knew it was gonna be crazy busy and so hard to be seen before the weekend when everything usually is closed with my luck and I live pretty far away but I called they said if you can come in now and already being in Chico that day not having to wait 3 hours for somewhere else I said, OH MY ARE YOU SERIOUS!!  I'll be right there I was so excited and happy</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1521211405661, 'text': "Lindsey Boehm, we're happy you found our staff to be so supportive during your experience here at European Wax Center.

The last girl didn't listen to me at all and waxed them into two thin lines that looked ridiculous. I've been growing them back out for months trying to get them to look like real eyebrows again.  Next time, I will spell out EXACTLY how much to take off, instead of telling the gal how happy I was to finally have fuller brows. Ugh.</review>< Pictures>

I always feel so welcomed by Faith and Randi when I walk in the door! They greet me by name, and they're always so positive & happy. I've been going to my waxer, Brittany, for several months & she's the best! She's so thorough which is amazing! And she makes me feel comfortable, and is super friendly!< /Review>

I love European Wax Center. Taylor was the one and only person that I would go to because she was so friendly and thorough with her job. She made you feel very comfortable and always explained exactly what she was doing and was very knowledgeable with any questions that I had. I definitely recommend going here for all your waxing needs :)</Review>

Very greatful it is under new ownership! I had some dissatisfing experiences in the past and decided to give them a org try since I still had two waxes left on my pass. I went to the brow event they hosted I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they were under new ownership! I was very happy with my wax and the whole experience. The new owner is very polite and thoughtful. I would recommend to anyone.<//Review>

< review>
I have enjoyed my experiences using this waxing company. However one experience really ruined me wanting to work with them again. I had scheduled an appointment at 3:45 and received a confirmation email for that time and day but on the day of when I arrived they said my appointment was at 2:30. I had received a voice mail the day before but did not listen to it as I had received the confirmation email already. Being in the service industry I believe that if you need to change an appointment time for a client you call them and confirm the different appointment time rather than just changing the appointment time and leaving them a voicemail. People have things going on during the day and aren't always able to adjust their schedules more than an hour. And so I was very disappointed and upset that they did not attempt to contact me more and only found out on the day of at the time of my original appointment that they couldn't get me in.</review>

I'd rate 5 star, but for the sales pressure. There is a constant pitch to buy products or more services, which is off-putting. It could be more subtle, I understand the reasoning, I just don't appreciate it.</review>

Went in to find out they raised their prices which is understandable however the lady made me feel very rushed waxing my brows without even prepping or putting calming cream on after, as a result my brows were uneven and still wax left on my skin. For that kind of money and mediocre results I will not be returning.<//review>

Do not bring your car here! SLOPPY WORK! Oakdale Auto Care & Tire damaged our car during repairs.... broke the turn signal, ripped shifting boot, scratched brake handle, and left the car greasy and dirty! Owner agreed on making all repairs due to damage and would provide us a partial refund check. While picking up car Manager at Oakdale Auto informed me that owner changed his mind and would NOT issue a refund! Not all repairs completed! Poor communication skills!< /review>

I went in, they tested battery, alternator and checked fuses. Gave me a quote and did repair while I waited. All work was done with warranty in writing. Friendly atmosphere and no pressure up sale. I'm very satisfied with work that was done and would recommend to anybody.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><text>2008 Cadillac wouldn't start. Had it towed to this shop and they called me and told me that the reason that my car would not start is that there was low compression in the cylinder, etc etc and that it was going to be $260 to do a further inpection to look at the rest of the cylinders, $1250 re-machine the piston if it needed to be fixed and if that didn't work, I would need a new motor! Had it towed home, charged the battery and voilla! car started right up, no problems. Seems like this place wanted to try and charge me thousands of dollars for nothing since they thought that they had me on the hook because my car was towed there?

Had made arrangements to changes shocks & struts, new tires and alignment.  Had shopped other local and Dealer bids for same work.
Oakdale Automotive was the lowest.  Expected to be a most of the day turn-around.  I had the car back in a matter of a few hours.  Steve & Luke are terrific to work with.<//review>

I started out at Les Schwab and what a mistake that was. The guys at Oakdale Automotive were kind, professional and honest. The work was done quickly. They respected the fact that I was there on my work lunch break.
The cost for my tire was $40 less, as well. I’ve driven by this business so many times, and I called them after I left the other tire place, completely frustrated. I am so happy I did.
They will get all my business now. I often feel some repair places take advantage of the fact that I am female and not terribly knowledgeable about car repair. That was not at all my experience here.<//review>

Well... unfortunately I have to say this company no longer has my support. The lack of customer concern left me a bit discomforted. Making unjustified political statements, AT A TIRE SHOP,  far out of line. Sad to see someone on one side of a political standpoint discriminate the other, like they encompass all people?? Very uneducated low blow.</review>

Highly recommend! Friendly, reliable, honest, and knowledgeable staff saved me. My car wouldn't start, and I initially towed my car to them. They realized it was a serious engine issue, and advised me to try to get the dealership to cover it under warranty since it would be so expensive to fix. Ron (the owner) even called my dealership directly on my behalf and got them to commit to covering my car under warranty! The dealership ended up giving me a horrible time once my car was towed there, and denying the claimed engine issue was there. Ron still acted on my behalf with them, and never charged me for anything he or his staff did!  Dealership ended up replacing the battery, sending me and my car home, and claiming Oakdale Auto Care & Tire were lying. WELL, a week later, my car broke down! Turns out Oakdale Auto was absolutely right! My car is currently at the dealership being fixed under warranty as we speak. I am forever grateful to Ron and the staff, and will always bring my business here, big or small!</text>

Only putting a one star on here because I have to do that.
The prices are reasonable but the  management or owners are unreal! they do not stand behind their customers when their employees  drops the  Center cone from the tire balancer or drops the socket while putting it on and Leaves  divots on my brand new rims.
I have NOT EVEN MADE my first truck payment on my Husbands truck!!
The Poor management this place has really needs to take  nice long look at there  Etiquette on how to speak to a  Customer that comes back with a complaint of the rims being destroyed .Due to there Employee  Ruining my rims on my tryck
I could go on for days and you say all kinds of things but in the end I would never ever take any of my automobiles to establishment that does not backup to come and stand up for what their employees done wrong.  You never even once offered to have my rims fixed!
You can take these in and have  Then fixed or resurfaced nothing was offered,</Review>

For as much as they charge they should use top quality parts which they dont and charge you for it,  they use garbage parts from oriellys paid alot of money to do my front end here it is a couple months later and im having to pay another shop to replace everything they did, before this I took my truck back 3 seperate times to them cause the cheap brake pads they were using kept breaking. My Dad is dealing with the same problem with these guys and they dont do nothing about it just make excuses. BE AWARE!!< /review>

Parts were replaced and wheel alignment  was done mileage at 339,140.All parts used were top quality ,Wagner and Motorcraft brake parts, Moog suspension and Monroe shocks.So in 13 months you put on 39,967 mile on your truck. I spoke with you on the phone 28th Feb. or March 1 you claimed we used cheap parts from Oreilly's and I told you was no true. I asked you to bring your truck back to the shop so we could have a inspection done and address your concerns,you have not come in so I can't validate your statements. We stand behind all repairs we perform at our shop,but when you don't return then I have to reply that your statement is BOGAS!\n\nEric Hewitt\nowner"}<//Response>

< Review>
I go to different 24 hour gyms and this one is by far the hottest! They don't turn the AC on I feel that I am overheating and I lose strength and energy because of it. I see 3 fans are on but on the lowest setting its ridiculous so much body heat and they can't turn on the AC for our $40 we pay a month??</Review>

<text>I like the ease of a contact less check-in. The 1.5 hours time slots to work out is just right to get a good enough session completed. This particular location provides more than enough supplies to keep the equipment as clean as possible. The only suggestion I would have is to increase on site staff. Overall, I believe 24 Hour Fitness is doing a credible job in this current environment. I feel safe and that's appreciated.< /text><Time>1609544993167< /Time><username>Anthony Villaflor<//username>< user>

<Text>All outdoor equipment covered by a giant easy up. Good social distancing and cleaning supplies available to wipe down equipment. You have to make a reservation in advance but easy to get into and they allow you a 1.5 hour workout. Nice and friendly employees as well.</Text>< date>

Given the circumstances, this gym has done a fantastic job to be flexible and accommodate us (the community). They're professional, understanding, and courteous. Their equipment is well taken care of (above 90%).<//review>

<Review>They have everything a gym should have. Employees are alright. Plenty of parking too. Only downside is when the maximum capacity is reached people have to line up outside but that usually only happens at its most busiest days and hours.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcb057b584b38d:0x87acdfb792accced< /Gmap_id><rate>3< /rate>< user_id>

< review>
Worst 24 hour fitness location I've ever visited. I go to 5 different 24Hr fitness locations. I visit the one in Apple Valley very occasionally. The one I go to the most, would be the small Hesperia location. I visit the one in San Bernardino occasionally, if I want to beat the traffic because it's right across the street from my job. I've been to the one in Moreno valley plenty times with friends as well. I visit this location in Riverside on weekend mornings.

The 24 Hour fitness in Riverside is by far, the worst location of all the locations I've visited. There's not enough squat racks and they don't even hand out towels... That stuff I can get get over it and dismiss... The thing that absolutely gets under my skin the most, is just how lazy the staff is on weekends!

NONE of the dumbbells are in their correct designated spot. They're either on the floor, or you'll see the 60lbs dumbbells on the 10lbs spot. I'm not even exaggerating. On one occasion I was using the 100lbs dumbbells, one of the workers comes to "organize" the dumbbells, there was 70lbs dumbbells near by, and this employee grabs those 70lbs dumbbells, places them where the 100lbs dumbbells go.

Every other 24 hour fitness location I visit, has staff members constantly walking back and forth to organize the weights. Even the small one in Hesperia which RARELY has people during the time I visit, I'll see the ONE staff member go organize weights.

I don't know if it's ran by corporate or if it's a franchise, but things needs to be taken care of. There is no excuse for how messy and unorganized it is on weekend mornings.

EDIT:

WILL BE UPDATING REVIEW THIS WEEKEND WITH PICTURES TO PROVE MY POINT.< /review>

<text>The best location in the city in my opinion. Plenty of equipment so that you don't have to wait, everything is clean and lots of cardio machines.

They don’t keep the equipment cleaned on a daily basis .  Nor doing they regularly check and clean women bathroom and steam room.  I can come 7 in the morning and the same trash and more are still located in these areas.  Several complaints have been made they say they will take care of the problem but it still exist.  They have plenty of young people working at the front desk loud laughing playing that could maintain the facility but they do not.<//Text>

<Text>They don’t keep the equipment cleaned on a daily basis .  Nor doing they regularly check and clean women bathroom and steam room.  I can come 7 in the morning and the same trash and more are still located in these areas.  Several complaints have been made they say they will take care of the problem but it still exist.  They have plenty of young people working at the front desk loud laughing playing that could maintain the facility but they do not.</Text>< pics>

<text>Had to put my membership on hold a few months ago. I check my bank statements every now and then, I look through them and see 2 charges, one for my membership fee of $39.99 and another for $49.99. Wasn't aware of the annual fee to "keep the gym clean". I thought that's what paychecks are for. Guess not. I was able to get my membership fee refunded through them, but the annual fee I wasn't.  A month goes by and guess what. I'm charged again for the annual fee. They say it was refunded but Xavier the manager says it's not refundable. Now I have to bring in my bank statements and prove I was charged when the lady at the front desk clearly said "I see you were charged twice but one was refunded" hmm I thought they didn't refund those. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I'M WARNING YOU.</text>< rating>

<Review>There is a Sport location 6 miles from this one that has more to offer than this "super sport".  I was excited when I heard there was going to be a Super Sport because I've gone to over 10 24hr Fitness and 4 of those have been Super Sport.  I was hoping for racquetball but wasn't holding my breath.  Not only did it not have that, it doesn't even have basketball courts.  There's also no towel service which is crazy because even some regular sports have towel service.  I'm not sure if 24s are franchises but that would be the only explanation as to why they thought they could get away with this.  Wither that or corporate got greedy and wanted to charge people extra for an inferior gym.  The only extra thing is that they have classes you can pick and watch in a big tv in the group x room but that's the equivalent of having home videos you can watch at home.  This 24 was a complete let down.  Unfortunately I have my service because this pool is less crowded than the Sport but man it sucks.< /Review>< rate>

Way to small! Why would they build it this small in Riverside?!  Its always extremely crowded and you can never get a machine. Plus the $40 a month is crazy for what this gym offers. You would be better off going to planet fitness if you want a gym that's 24hrs.< /text>

<Review>People leave their things everywhere and staff does nothing about it. There was water bottles that were left on machines for  days. And weights are literally everywhere and completely out of order. For being a super sport and going to other 24 hours this one doesnt compare. The 2 stars are because at least the locker rooms are decent<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>First impressions at this gym were not that great. The first associate said there was nothing they could do with my current 24 Hour Sport pass because I got it from Costco (not correct), luckily the manager was there to correct him. Overall it is pretty well maintained and clean with exception to the sauna which is pretty dirty for being brand new. Good selection of machines, even when its busy you can get a decent workout in without waiting too long. No towel service at this Super Sport.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Awesome gym, clean, new equipment, nice staff! We’ve travelled all around Orange County and LA and this is def one of the nicer ones for sure! The only thing I wish they had was towel service but it’s not a deal breaker so I’m satisfied!<//Text>

<Review>Love this gym, in my opinion it is the best 24 in the area. They are still doing construction in the lot, so there is only one entrance. There is no basketball court or towels, so if that's something you need in a gym this isn't the gym for you. Staff is friendly, and so far will maintained.</Review>< pictures>

<review>It’s a good location with all the equipment I need as a beginner to weightlifting. So many gyms do not have squat racks or dedicated lifting stations. This gym has four which is 4 more than most.

The fact that the mirrors aren’t floor length and the squat rack faces a window is annoying. I like to check my form while doing the exercise but it’s next to impossible once you get low in the squat.

I do think that perhaps they should invest in more of them instead of the smith guided barbell thing they have two of since often they aren’t in use. The squat rack is the king of weights section since that’s where all the major compound lifts are performed.

Overall, I wish they had more of the equipment that faces major use such as flat bench presses (only 3) instead of inclines/declines and Olympic lifting instead of the boxing area that rarely anyone uses.

They do have a neat children’s play pen area for parents that need to work out hard but also have to keep track of their kids.

I don’t use the pool or sauna. I don’t buy stuff in the store (why even have that?). I don’t really do cardio (this is not the gym to go to for cardio).< /review><userid>116874732178914225159</userid>< gmapID>

My mother and I had a membership, which I cancelled 3 days after she suddenly passed away. I received the confirmation that the membership was cancelled, 3 weeks later almost $300 dollars was charged to her account for a personal trainer. Now I have to wait approximately 22 days for them to fix the problem that they caused and refund the money that they should have never took from a dead woman. How can you trust a company that would do something like this<//Text>

I pay good money to come here and they are seriously lacking equipment for this size gym. They have no shoulder press bench, only 2 abdominal machines, and no trap machine. They close the sauna for 5 HOURS now from 11pm-4am!!! That is upsetting when charged 40 bucks per month.</review>

No star if could. Poor service, females no privacy at Sauna, no baby sitter when u need them mostly picky. U have to buy towels or worst no towels at all...expensive membership and annual fees. It would be fine if u actually get what u paid for...but no they have alibi’s why they cannot do their job. I got flu in this place because some guys joined in the Sauna and he is so sick! Cellphones should not be allowed in Saunas people are trying to relax but some people are playing loud music! Sick place to go..: cancelled my m membership as it is not what i expected for a sport club gym as they said.<//text>

<Text>I took my sister so she could get a 3-day pass and just try it out. Being that it's a new gym, I was excited. I also wanted to go work out here and see what was different from the other super sports I usually go to. Black female at the front was very nice and professional. Immediately felt welcome with her. However, my sister was asking her about a 3-day pass and out of nowhere some very rude and unprofessional employee invites himself into the conversation and starts talking about how they can't issue them at the time because he had already clocked out. If he was clocked out, why did he even bother to talk to us? We were doing just fine talking to the young lady in the front. And to top it off he said the only way to issue a pass at the moment was to put down a deposit. A deposit? For a FREE 3-day pass? Yeah, no thank you. I just feel like first impressions are everything, and they definitely ruined this location for me. Will not be going back anytime soon. My sister has already looked into other gyms and already got a FULL  FREE WEEK for one gym and a FULL FREE MONTH for another. And they made it a HUGE deal over a 3-day pass here. I will definitely consider changing gyms just do to the treatment we received. Just made me feel like all they want is our money. They need some serious training on customer service.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I have a membership here but totally regret it they never told me i had to pay a annual fee and after 3 months there's a almost 50 dollar charge plus the monthly fee i was so mad because the guy insisted he advised me about the yearly fee, a total lie 🤥 the gym is ok they have everything new of course but there is no motivation the trainers look like they don't even work out how are you going ro pay to look like a regular person to work out in your own is ok most of the time there is not too much people kids club is a little pricey they should consider that the mebership is already expensive i undertand kids will like it but what of you have more than one kid especially now in summer time<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Surprisingly dirty and it smelled bad in the locker room for a location that is almost brand new.

Also, this location is a fake super sport.  No towel service, etc.  Pretty crappy to charge that price to the customer and provide a service that is subpar compared to the other locations around here.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

DO NOT SIGN UP!! THEY WILL BILL YOU THINGS YOU DID NOT EVER GET ANY WARNING ABOUT!! So we signed up and as usual we paid a fee to join. They never mentioned that 3 months in they arbitrarily charge you a $50 per person "annual fee" at 3 months??? And they say it is on page 1 of the docusogn paperwork they don't actually give you a copy of!! I am calling the main office which is not open 24 hours. Do NOT BE FOOLED. If you join this gym they will bill you in 3 months an annual membership fee that no other gym I have ever been a member of ever did such a thing. They also do not have any control over temperatures and then keep the cycle room extremely hot! So who wants to try to exercise when a room is 76 degrees!! The only thing they can do is turn on fans that bring it down 1 to 2 degrees if there are a few people in the room. So I paid right at $200 to join the gym and $80 a month then 3 months in they bill an additional $100 plus our monthly $80. This is crazy. We have been members at Ballys, Lifetime, and LA Fitness over the years, NO ONE EVER HAD AN ANNUAL FEE!! They stated it was for wear and tear on the equipment. Is that not a part of our membership fees we pay monthly??? It seems like they really have lost their minds and are not interested in being honest about the price. That makes me really angry that they could have been upfront on all this and just honestly added that BS annual fee into the monthly fee like normal gyms have always done. And so tomorrow I have to call back to find out what corporate has to say since they are not open 24 hours. But please be warned they are ripping people off. It is more about feeling lied to than money!! Just randomly adding whatever they want to the credit card you put on file!! #shadybusiness #ripoff #badbusiness #lyingwhenyousignup #shadygym</Review>

There is a woman who usually come to the gym around 10pm to 12 midnight.  She always disrespectfully turn on her music to have other people hear HER music, in the pool, shower, or the locker room.  I have been reported her rude behavior to the staffs several, but the management can't do anything about it.   :(</review>

Read the yelp reviews .They are horrible.  This place is a total joke . The sauna is turned off 11 pm to 5 Am every day . The steam room is cold . You sit in it waiting for it to get warm and it never does . You end shivering because you are wet in a cold room. . 39.99 $ per month is not worth it .<//review>

Don't waist your time and money
There was nothing wrong with my teeth
After trusting 4030 dental
I have all sorts of problems
They will lie and lie and lie some more to get more and more money
They aren't good at all they don't even know how to work on teeth

However the orthodontist that is in that office is a great ortho and does a great work.<//review>< pics>

Dr. Aldairi Husam is one of the most disrespectful Dr. I have ever seen. The way he speaks to his patients is awful and unprofessional. I would not recommend this clinic to anyone. Him and his assistants are over the top with rudeness. He should be working at a club with his assistants NOT a clinic.< /Text>

The RECEPTIONISTS are very rude and inconsiderate. I would never recommend this dental office to any of my family or friends. It seems they "JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER."

I have never in my life received such horrible service, Dr.Hussam Aldairi was the Doctor who I was seen by, and he treated me very poorly, He was extremely rude, arrogant, very unprofessional, and unreliable. He does not care about his patients, he has preferences on who he will help, I waited months to be seen for him to simply not show up the day of my appointment, not only once, but THREE TIMES!!! I missed work for these appointments and for what? To show up and him not be there but he doesn't have a problem remembering to charge my insurance, the whole staff was very unhelpful, they didn't even bother to call and they cover for him. One of the days he didn't show up due to an "emergency " I looked into it and found out he was at the El Cajon location working on a different patient! If you are thinking to come to this place, or someone referred you here please look for another place, you will honestly thank me because this establishment should be shut down due to lack of experience and unprofessionalism.< /text>

I’ve had problems with the people who schedule appointments, I take a day off work and walk in to my appointment and they tell me “oh your appointment is not today!” Its like my calendar and I are lying! They don’t even apologize and say the truth that they’re the ones who moved my appointment without calling me or letting me know. I mean they need to be taught more about professionalism and how they should treat their patients!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

All what they care about is how to rip off the patient, I visited them to refill a cavity but Dr. Husam put their benefits over the patient’s benefit! They supposed to be taking care of my teeth but they did more than filling the cavity just to take more money from my insurance, they did the same thing with my mom, they made her visit them at least twice a month for over a year and my mom started having severe teeth pain right after the first visit and yet! My mom tells them of the pain but they NEGLECT her and they kept lying and tell my mom different stories. I highly advise all to AVOID and double check what they tell you, DO NOT BELIEVE THEM, would rate them even negative.</text><username>Nore Butris< /username><date>1533826247610< /date>< resp>

<Text>Dr Hussam and Dr Neran have a very bad attitude, judgemental, and very arrogant, they are the king and the queen of DRAMA. On top of that they don't respect their patients. They have a very prideful attitude as if they are doing us a favor and we should bow down to them and they think they can treat us as they desire, they are in this business they are getting paid for it by our money and our Insurance but they don't appreciate us and when they make a mistake they never acknowledge it, they're very unprofessional. Don't just waste your time and go there, find another dentist office, it will save your time and a headache and stress... believe me.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎<//Text>< GmapID>

If you care about your teeth or your well being at all, stay farrrrr away from this place. They ruined my root canal and crown over 2 months ago. I have been in pain everyday. I went in, they looked at my face and said it doesn't look like you're in pain. How these uneducated front desk people can make a medical decision like this is first of all illegal and unprofessional. The office manager RAGHAD should not be allowed to talk to patients with her disgusting demeanor. She just told me go ahead and do whatever you want, call the cops if you want, we can't help you. I was not in pain before I went to this place. I will be reporting both dr. Husam Aldairi and this disgusting excuse for a human raghad to the better business bureau and to the American dental association. This place should be closed. They are horrible at patient care and have zero follow up etiquette or customer service skills. Shame on you people for operating under these circumstances.<//Text>

All I want from them to put an Orthodontic and they said I have to make 4 fillings then we'll give you an Orthodontics as free if I use 2000$ with them. I had 2000$ for dental clinics. So after they made fillings and took 2000$ they said that right now we can make u an appointment to put an orthodontic to you. I said ok they gave me an appointment one month later my appointment was 13th May but  I forgot it before they always send me a (message) before my appointment 24 hours but when they took 2000$ they didn't care about this appointment!
So I hope they be honest with all people when they say anything and care. However, I don't visit this place anymore also I will advise all my friends and tell them about what happened to me with this dental clinic.

Thank you.

This has to be the best clinic I’ve been to yet and I get free service. The manager(s) are very professional and same with the doctors. The best doctors would have to be dr.Aldairi and dr.mustafa. I highly recommend this dental clinic.</text>

This place is a dental care assembly line. They get you in the chair and then you have no choice but wait while the the doctor does a bit of a procedure on you, then runs to the next room to do a partial procedure on another patient, then another, and finally comes back to you. There is NO individualized  care at this dental care assembly line.

If you complain, they take it as a racist comment and accuse you of complaining because the doctors are all Arabs/Middle East. They accuse you of being racist when that is not the case; you are complaining because they SUCK, not because they are of Middle-Eastern descent! I demanded they give me my medical records and then I went to another dentist. When I did, the new dentist told me 40/30 dental did an extremely poor job on my dental crown--they only did half of what was needed.</Text>

I have been going over there for more than 6 month and have been oatient with them and they rub it on my face like they did a free work for me. They canceled my appointment without my notice and pretended that nothing has happened. If you pay cash they book you right away and if you are a medical patience it tales forveer for them to give you appointments and they are always going from one room to another. It takes forever to call you name and when they do you have to sit in the chair forveer because the lazy doctor does not want to work more days to make appropriate time for the patience, definitely discrimination and prejedice. Peole do NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. This is trash they will waste your time and money!!!!!!!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>They don’t respect the time so if you have an appointment at 10 you will be seen by the doctor after at least one hour or maybe more, and then your next appointment will be too late so probably after 3 or 4 months. It’s so bad!!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend Dr. Hossam Al-Dairi ... It is not suitable for a doctor to be a mean person ... and harassing women and his ridiculous appearances ... A person who is morally fallen.

<Text>(Translated by Google) A very bad clinic in dealing with customers, from the secretary dealing in a dry way and a fake smile (if I smile in the first), passing the late dates, I gave me the first date after four months and when I went to the first appointment they gave me 11 appointments and the earliest appointment after three months, so that I went to another clinic And it turned out that all I needed was only five appointments, not 11 appointments, and I finished my entire tooth with just three months, in another better and better clinic, so when my wife went to this clinic, their treatment was worse, and even the doctor himself, the owner of the clinic Dr. Hussam and his wife, gave the anesthetic and left the patient For more than an hour to speak on the phone and when I blamed him for what If I was late, he started to go beyond words and raise his voice with logistic words, and when his wife came from Al-Manjar I expected that she is a respectable person and she will apologize, but she expelled us from the clinic ......... Doctors mocking marketers who do not know to treat gentle and respect through. Going to this clinic is a loss of time, money, and health. There are many clinics much better than these marketers.

عيادة سيئة جدا في التعامل مع الزبائن , من السكرتيرة تتعامل بأسلوب جاف وابتسامة مزيفة(هذا إذا ابسمت بالاصل) مرورا بالمواعيد المتأخرة , انا اعطوني اول موعد بعد اربع شهور وعندما ذهبت للموعد الاول اعطوني 11 موعد وافرب موعد بعد ثلاث شهور , بحيث اني ذهبت لعيادة اخرى وتبين ان كل ما كنت احتاجه هو فقط خمسة مواعيد وليس 11 موعد وانهيت اسناني كلها بثلاث شهور فقط , في عيادة اخرى افضل واجود, كذالك عندما ذهبت زوجتي لهذه العيادة كان تعاملهم اسوأ وحتى الدكتور نفسه صاحب العيادة د.حسام وزوجته, بحيث اعطى  البنج وترك المريض لأكثر من ساعة ليتحدث بالموبايل وعندما عاتبته لماذا تأخرت , بدأ يتجاوز بالكلام ويرفع صوته بالفاظ سوقية , وعندما اتت زوجته المنجر توقعت انها انسانة محترمة وسوف تعتذر بل هي طردتنا من العيادة......... اطباء مسخرة سوقيين لا يعرفون للتعامل اللطيف والاحترام طريق. الذهاب لهذه العيادة خسارة للوقت والمال والصحة. يوجد العديد من العيادات افضل بكثير من هؤلاء السوقيين.<//Text>< Pictures>

Awesome venue for a workout, indoor and outdoor workouts. Very well timed and controlled. Trainer Mike is great at helping out beginners.
Look forward to coming back again.< /Review>

I have been training at Versatile for several years.  During COVID it was almost like losing a limb when I couldn't go in and work out.  Bryan who is the owner is one of the most engaging people that I have ever met in the training world.  His energy is infectious and he finds a way to always keep the workouts new and challenging.  Thankfully Bryan was able to offer At-Home training routines to follow or I may have lost all of what I worked so hard to gain.

I couldn't think higher of Versatile Fitness and Bryan's instruction.  If you are looking for a place to train GO TO VERSATILE!  It doesn't matter if you are in the best shape of your life or at ROCK BOTTOM Bryan has a workout for you.

Getting better by 1% everyday adds up and you will get that training here.<//text>

<review>This place is the best!! I have been coming here for over 2 years around 4-5 times a week and Bryan and Mike have been amazing each and every time! Tough, boot camp style workouts that are guaranteed to make you sweat and leave you sore, but the results will be worth it!! Thanks for always kicking my butt!</review>< pics>

<Text>Great classes! I’ve been to all sorts of classes across every major city while I travel for work and Versatile Fitness is the best. You get the trainer expertise and high energy workouts you’ll find at a Barry’s Bootcamp or Orange Theory but with a more close knit community that gives you hands on attention. Would recommend for anyone who wants an effective workout where you’ll see results.</Text>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Review update: Started going to VF around Feb-Mar 2020 and enjoyed the variety of workouts, coaches, music, and the daily schedule that provides class options throughout the day. The 5:30 AM M-F class is perfect for me.  When I workout I'm not much of a talker and appreciate that most other members also workout first and socialize second. During quarentine restrictions the staff made major adjustments setting up their expensive equipment outside ensuring the quality of workouts didn't lessen during these times that we can't workout inside.

After 6ish months of working out with VF crew I don't think I'll be going elsewhere for my workouts. The staff is top-notch and regardless of class size they pay attention to how individuals are doing and provide adjustments as needed.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Amazing is all I have to say! I've been with Versatile for 2 years now and will never leave! The trainers and people you meet in the classes become your family! Always pushing you and encouraging you to be your best! The work outs are always changing up and always so much fun! Music is always on point, and let's just say you won't be disappointed!! Join now and change your life for the better!</Review>

Great place to get in and get some work done! Every day is a new and challenging workout regardless of your fitness level.  ALL the trainers are invested in the culture at this place and are more than willing to share their success stories, guide you through workouts, help you supplements or just motivate you to be your best.  Great way to spend 45 minutes of your day! Highly recommend the Fat Shred Challenge if you need a fitness jump start or just to try a new routine!</Text>

I hate the gym, but I don't hate Versatile Fitness. I reluctantly came with some friends last year and loved it. The work outs go so fast and they are always different. The trainers are excellent and encouraging. My surf paddle strength has greatly increased which has made surfing way more fun. If you live in the PB area I definitely recommend coming here.< /Review>

You may die your first class and think what did I just get myself into...but as a woman who always lacked upper body strength, I actually have some legit muscles now. 💪🏻  I’m so glad I didn’t quit after that first class and kept coming back.
The key is to make the personal commitment and just keep coming back, you WILL see an improvement in your body and endurance level.
All of the trainers are excellent and want to help make you better. There’s definitely a sense of community, which is something I loved.
Try their 7 day trial for $10, so worth it!<//Review>

Love this gym. I’ve never stuck with a gym more than a month or two, but a friend brought me to Versatile Fitness a year ago and I can’t imagine going to any other gym. The trainers are all super friendly and supportive. Each class is a little different, so you never feel stuck in a boring gym routine.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Bryan, Mike, Chaya, and the rest of the trainers at VF are the real deal. They all have the heart of a teacher and actually care about you achieving your goals. I trained with them for about 9 months. The workouts were upbeat, fun, and each trainer had their own positive training style. The only reason we stopped going was because we moved out of state. I saw real result and was guided by real trainers who cared about my success. I would recommend them to anyone who is ready to make a real change and wants guided workouts backed by a strong community.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Versatile Fitness isn't just a gym...it's a fantastic group of people who have saved me from my own taco/wine/pizza loving self. I started coming to VF 3 months ago...I have lost almost 20 pounds and never felt so strong. Thank you SO MUCH Mike, Bryan, Candice, Edgar, Chaya, and Chelsea for your constant encouragement, motivation, and positive attitudes. Looking forward to 2018!< /Text>

If you want to get your booty into shape, and have a great time then this is the gym for you. Quick 45 minute classes with AM and PM openings. The trainers truly get to know you and are always coming up with new workouts for us to do. It's never a dull day at VF! It's more than a gym, its a fit fam!< /Review>

I started with the Fat Burn Challenge and have stayed on with the gym since.  Throughout my life I've had personal trainers and other gyms and this is hands down my favorite.  I came to Versatile Fitness at my most out of shape ever as an adult, I really hadn't worked out in 9+ years, and it is so great to simply show up, do what I'm told and get a great workout quickly and efficiently.  The workouts can be done at any fitness level and I don't see an end to the challenge.< /Text>

<Review>I hated my postpartum body.  But, I loved my baby and focused my entire existence on keeping him alive. I forgot about me. The mom-guilt was strong, but the mom-bod was not cute. I had to do something. I took a leap of faith and signed up for fat shred challenge in Jan 2015. I was terrified until I showed up. I was pleasantly surprised that the workouts were ONLY 45 minutes.  What was even more appealing was that every 45 seconds you switch to a new station that was more challenging than the next. I kept telling myself "you can do anything for 45 seconds!"  - I got this!

Fast forward three years, I'm 30 lbs lighter and leaner. I have more energy for my very active toddler which is a huge win. The balance that I've found in focusing on ME and setting aside 45 minutes 5 days a week has made me a better mom (i think). Ha.

If you're ready to be a better version of you, check this gym out. You won't regret it. Every single trainer is amazing. Bryan, Mike, Edgar, and Chaya...wow. I can't thank you guys enough for inspiring me in more ways than you know.  Thank you for being a gym that i can call home. You're constantly improving which is also what I keep coming back for.<//Review>< pictures>

Versatile Fitness provides a killer circuit workout. When the 45 minutes is up, I'm out of breath and sweaty. The trainers are motivating and friendly. After they figure out what you can handle, they add or adjust exercises to challenge you more. I got tired of the same routines at the gym and having to plan ahead for different exercises. Coming in and having it set is convenient and makes the 45 minutes all about the exercise, not socializing or waiting for machines. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to switch it up this year!</text>

<review>VF is the best gym I’ve ever paid for for numerous reasons.
1.) The trainers are super friendly. They don’t just know their stuff, they make the workouts fun and they put the extra effort into getting to know their customers.
2.) The workouts are insane. After 1 full year of going to VF I’ve transformed my body and sef-esteem. The workouts they design get your heart rate up, and your muscles pumping every time.
3.) The community. People that go to VF know eachother’s names and a lot of us hang out outside of the gym. Good people are attracted to a good gym.
4.) There is no judgement at any time and people of all walks of life go to VF and sweat together. The workouts are a litte intense if you’re very overweight or haven’t worked out in an extended period of time, but if you’re remotely athletic you’ll love the workouts.
5.) The pride that Bryan and Mike have for their business is rare. Most people go for a big chain gym or a cheap gym and will never get the experience of being a part of a small but rockin’ business. Bryan and Mike love this gym and the community of VF beasts and it shows.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>The actual product is good but any / all of the employees should be fired and need to undergo change. They aren’t friendly or professional, any questions seem to be the biggest inconvenience and they don’t make any suggestions or help. These people clearly  don’t care about customers. Save your money and go somewhere else. It will be worth the drive.<//Review>< Pictures>

They have everything that you can possibly need for growing. Great pricing, knowledgable staff, and it's definitely my go-to store. Its tucked up next to Mountaisia, up the same long drive way, in case you have trouble finding the entrance. I drive so far to come here--I live in the Valley, but I only come to this place. 5 stars all the way.<//text>

The customer service here is amazing. Better than a high end hotel no joke. They will go out of their way to make sure you get what you're looking for. Great team of guys there and very knowledgeable. I've been going There for years and the service has never changed. It doesn't matter if you are just getting a mix cup or 100 lights, they treat every customer like #1.</Text>

They literally charge double for Canna Coco A+B than everywhere else in California. I tried to explain to 2 separate people that they are supposed to be sold as a set for that price rather than individually, but they continued their lie or ignorance. Do some research next time idiots!</Review>

< review>
I have known these guys for years.  I distribute a secondary fertilizer, called Sea-Crop.  These guys picked it up right off the bat, for both their stores.  Now Sea-Crop is in 51 stores and growing daily!  Thanks for the support guys.  They treat everyone equally, from the experienced grower on down to the newbie.  Great prices too!</review>

<Review>These guys know gardening and have everything you need. Way better than Lowe's or Home Depot if you're looking for anything to help improve your garden.< /Review>< user_name>

They are under new ownership, so if you didn't like them before, you'll like them now.  Friendly and knowledgable.  Check them out!  A plus...open Sunday, unlike the other hydro store in Thousand Oaks.<//Text>

<Review>I have never liked the extra charge they have, I was once hooked on this thrift store but I started adding up how much the extra charge was taking away from me for free & I stopped for years coming here. Until recently w the pandemic I started coming again. Prices are okay when it comes to toys household simple stuff like that. But the clothes seems a little over priced.  Associates there are whatever not much hospitality. You can find some good finds here & there.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

<review>I shop here all the time for stuff for my classroom. Great deals but it's a hit and miss because the stuff is donated. But if you don't mind checking it out on a daily, weekly, or just spur of the moment you might be surprised at what you might find! I'm only telling you because I have too much stuff and I need people to buy it before I do!</review>< name>

Some items are a bit overpriced and on top your purchase they add a 10% surcharge (???)  they say it's to keep prices down, but who knows , at least they post it that notice on the door so that you will not be surprised when you  pay (and of course sales tax is added).  They have a do not have  daily 50% off color tags however on Friday's they have 2 colors 1/2 off , remember the 10% sub charge addition though.<//review>

<Date>1541344885255< /Date><rate>1</rate><Review>🚦🚦🚦Pay close attention, if you purchase any type of furnitures in this place and you don't have a big car to take them home they will charge you if you pick it up the next day. I got a dining table here for $149.91 surcharge was 14.99. Taxes 16.90 in total was  $181.80. I'm not adding what i paid to take it home. I couldn't take it the same day because i had to work at 5:00p.m to 2:00a.m. a Saturday, Now i have my doubts about the dining table if it is  worthy or not!! Another point here is that these places get  all this stuff for free and they already know that life in California is expensive and they over charged you? If they have some selected items at a low price it is beacuse they have been there for over three weeks so they need to get rid off of all that junk! People who says that these people are friendly probably are friends because i did not see no smile from them or a thank you for spending $181.80🙄<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Got some jeans that were $4.29 and once I went to pay, it went up to $5.29?? They said besides taxes, they charge a surcharge fee? What is this? I just see it as a dollar of tax which is way too much for an item priced $4. St Vincent de paul has the best prices and all prices are flat with no tax or fees, dont come here, just go to st vincent.< /Review></record>

I like this place, although they don't get the best of donations. They are small but I do find things there.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I love The Habit and this location is always good. The food comes quickly after ordering. The staff is friendly. On our last visit we had the seasonal garlic Parmesan fries.  Very good and very garlicky!  I usually get the Teriyaki Char. No cheese, onions, or mayo. I’m a purist...I like mine with just sauce, lettuce, and pineapple.  So good!

We will usually share a side of fried green beans and onion rings or fries.

The burgers are flavorful and juicy.  Not like the tiny overcooked ones at another chain.

There is indoor and outside seating. Can be hard to get a seat when busy. Also the parking lot is difficult. Whoever planned the layout should be fired.  Just saying.....</Review><Time>1554009432309</Time></record>

I've posted this on Facebook and will repost on yelp i don't know if I became invisible or what happened but I don't appreciate the service i was given and only put two starts because I generally like the food from the habit. I was standing in line behind a woman who was ordering when a man and his son walked up to the left of us seemingly in no line at all. To my surprise when the woman finished the man taking her order then turned to the men and said we'll take your order now I couldn't believe it and almost walked out but hoped for an explanation. I was called finally when they walked away and asked why they were swrved first and the girl at the counter didn't have an answer so I'm here writing this review it was really uncomfortable and unacceptable</Text>

<Review>Place is very clean but the employee's are not to bright every time I have ever been here they have always messed up my order some how tonight the young lady said our whole order back to us but when I got home they put a totally different order the sad part is when I got home and realized my order was wrong it was already closed and no one answered my call I can see if this was the 1st time but this happens every time we go ! I will not be back but I will go in tomorrow with my receipt and demand a refund!!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

My daughter loves this place. She always gets the kids meal with burger with cheese. She used to complain that it took to long to get the food but now she is willing to wait. She says almost as good as In-n-out. That is saying something cause she loves that place.</review>

< Review>
The burger was good. It comes with all the normal toppings. A basic burger was large and very satisfying. I went on a Sunday evening and it was rather busy. Waited for 15 to 20 min for my food as a take out order. They did include plenty of napkins, ranch and blue cheese at no additional charge. I would recommend ordering ahead to avoid the long lines.< /Review>

<Text>Where to start.... The Habit is one of my favourite places to eat. Their burgers are always juicy, well seasoned and generous with portions and toppings. Fries are fresh every time. Their salads are the best and it's not that disgusting cold deli chicken they put on their but delicious hot seasoned chicken. I am in love with their Southwest Bbq salad. It hits all the right spots with the cilantro lime ranch too.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcb74b01215b47:0x665be6d465d4cc41</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I came in today February 24th of 18 and I got a double Santa Barbara cheeseburger with bacon and no tomato along with onion rings the burger was really good as well as the onion rings the only problem was is they don't clean the tables after people are done eating there's trash all over the floor and it takes awhile to get your food but I guess it's worth the wait cuz the food is really good I'll be back but probably to the one in Menifee where it's cleaner<//Text>

My husband and I came to dinner at the habit and really enjoyed the food but most of all I really loved how the manager Jose treats his employees. He told each one of them by name how great they were doing. Love the customer service here so great. Thank you for your hard work.</review>

Ordered the double char and was asked if I wanted cheese. Meat tasted frozen. I mentioned it to the staff and they said they would get back to me.  Waited 20 mins and nobody ever came back.
Fries seemed fresh at least, but their deep fryer looks like it needs to be scrubbed and have the oil changed.< /Review>

The food was good (onions a bit salty) but good. The restaurant is to cold inside to enjoy your meal though. They need to lower the AC.<//text>

Dry, flavorless, unremarkable burger, small portion of cold fries, watered down, bland ranch dressing. Overpriced for the quality. I will not return nor recommend. Riverside on Tyler.</review>

<Review>This was the first time I was going to visit this restaurant and I won't be returning.  I went in about 6pm and was standing there for like 5 minutes and was never even greeted.  No "hi welcome" or "we'll be with you shortly ". Nothing. This is super bad customer service. Well.. I guess I'll never leave a food review because I will not be returning.<//Review>< pics>

Habit Grill gave La Sierra High School a coupon for a free burger! My husband and I tried them on Sunday evening and we weren't disappointed. The service was great, nice smiles and warm greetings. Clean and wonderful smells. We ordered the onion rings and loved them!
Would definitely recommend and go again! Even without a coupon!<//review>

I can't remember a Santa Barbara Burger being so greasy I didn't add anything extra just exchanged mayonnaise for mustard. The onion rings were less greasy tgan the Santa Barbara. Go figure...? Flavor was decent all the way around though. Greg</Review>

I'm giving it 4 Stars cuz I love the burgers here, they're delicious and so is the strawberry milkshake, my favorite milkshake compared to other restaurants. However, just taking off the one star because the Gold Chicken Sandwich was actually amazing when they first came out with it but the quality of it has gone down big time and it sucks now.< /Review>

One of my favorite places to go. They have all kinds of concoctions you can make. And for those people that want a little more, they have a little ingredients bar with some amazing peppers. Good hamburgers and good service.<//text>

<text>The Santa Barbara Char? This was my order without mayo and without cheese . Took one bite and looked at the beef wondering why it was do soft.  It was the reddest burger I've ever seen. Took it back and between the rep and who ever the chef was it was delivered back as a single burger, pink now not bloody red but it was not A Santa Barbara Char anymore. No avocado, no double burger. Decided to leave it on the table and never eat at the Habbit again.<//text><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

< review>
I went in to have what I believe is my last hamburger-a double char with cheese, and onion rings, only to find out I can have the meet wrapped in lettuce (bunless). They have a veggie burger option, various salads,  Plus they have garlic roasted brussel sprouts and some other healthy  choices. I'm glad I went, and will be heading back.< /review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>OK, so I'm going to change my initial review to four stars based on corp. customer service. I'll give this location another chance in the near  future and will update my review again at that point. In the meantime, when you visit any habit burger, be sure to tell them that "The Mattress Maverick" sent you. We don't get anything outside of a smile and maybe even a giggle, but you never know either. What if you walked in and they told you that I pre-paid for your meal. Plus if I happen to be sitting anyplace having a meal and hear someone telling the cashier that, I'm going to get up and pay for that person's meal. Updated review coming soon.</review>< Resp>

If you see a long line, do not be discouraged. They handle lines perfectly. The service is great, food comes out swiftly. The food itself is amazing, i got the Santa Barbara style and it was delicious. The sourdough bread, patties, and avocados were perfect together. I got the sweet potato fries with it and they were awesome, only critique is a pinch of seasoning.<//review>

<review>My sister's significant other loves this place. However I'm not as impressed. The initial price seems reasonable whereas if you get anything different then the Habit Burger you're talking a lot more money. What I had was delicious but what I wanted was way too expensive!<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Not quite the best burger, but better than most fast food burger places. They are cooked fresh, you have several options to customize your burger, and the patties are good sized. Not paper thin like some places.</Review>

The only problem I had with this place was that there was only one vegetarian burger on the menu. Since I am a vegetarian, I didn't really get a choice on which burger I wanted to eat.

Twice you've messed up my order on a plain burger. Why do you add cheese and then onions when I order completely plain. For this reason yall should go back to 10hr. Pathetic service here<//Text>

<Review>Disappointed with The Habit the last two times. The Charburger and fries were cold and the bun stuck to the paper ripped half the top off and the sweet potato fries were soggy. At least the vanilla shake was good!**Update**Went back ordered the same and it was delicious! Thank you for making it better!<//Review><Rating>4< /Rating>< username>

<Text>Went around 2:15. No other customers in line.  Received order fairly quickly.  Cashier was courteous. Ordered the Santa Barbara sandwich, small fries and coke.  $11 and some change.  Pricier than combo at some other fast food places.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Very good charbroiled hamburgers reminiscent of days gone by. However, the French Fries at this facility are sometimes limp, under cooked and served warm not hot. Other Habit facilities are much better.   I guess you pays your money and you takes your chances ! !</Text>

<review>Food and service was good as per usual.   It was busy but it didnt take too long.

Left my purse there like an idiot,  when I called they asked for a little info to make sure it was mine and held it for me!  They clean up really quickly,  so they got it before a customer took it.   Awesome manager, and I got my purse back with everything in it no problems.  Everyone was super sweet and friendly the whole time,  and I really appreciated their help!  10/10 would leave purse there again.</review><GmapID>0x80dcb74b01215b47:0x665be6d465d4cc41< /GmapID><user_name>Lauren Fukushima<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

One of the BEST BURGER'S AROUND! All the talk/arguments about who's burger is the best, to me everyone is different and has their own opinion. I've had The Habit, In-N-Out, Whataburger, Five Guys, and many "mom & pops" burgers.. But I can promise you this, I will always go back to The Habit. Always good, always fresh, and I absolutely love the pepperoncini's, they are always SUPER FRESH! lol. But if you've never had or just looking for a good burger, this place should definitely be a go to! My hat is always off to this particular joint, service is never short of great!< /Text>

<time>1550766086820< /time><rate>5<//rate><Review>One of the BEST BURGER'S AROUND! All the talk/arguments about who's burger is the best, to me everyone is different and has their own opinion. I've had The Habit, In-N-Out, Whataburger, Five Guys, and many "mom & pops" burgers.. But I can promise you this, I will always go back to The Habit. Always good, always fresh, and I absolutely love the pepperoncini's, they are always SUPER FRESH! lol. But if you've never had or just looking for a good burger, this place should definitely be a go to! My hat is always off to this particular joint, service is never short of great!</Review>< pictures>

Very good charbroiled hamburgers reminiscent of days gone by. However, the French Fries at this facility are sometimes limp, under cooked and served warm not hot. Other Habit facilities are much better.   I guess you pays your money and you takes your chances ! !<//Text>

The Habit is a decent place to get a Burger or a Sandwich. I got the tri tip Sandwich and it was pretty good. I'll say better than McDonalds because of the variety of the menu but nothing spectacular.<//Review>

I really enjoy their Portabella Charburger. It has lots of umami! Their ahi tuna filet sandwich is good as well. Onion rings are always nice and crispy, you just wished their portion size is a bit bigger for the price paid.</review>

I received very disappointing customer service at this location.  I had signed up for the  Char club - The Habit then sent me a coupon for a free burger.  I handed the coupon to the cashier - she forgot to take off the coupon.  So she talked to another employee about having them refund my money, (before even the next customer placed their order) that employee then talked to another higher level employee.  They then told me that they could not refund the over charged amount, that I would have to come back at another time to use the coupon. and that there was nothing they could do.  i will start going to the other location in Riverside.<//Text>

Its nice looking inside and out but vents over the grills must not work the best because the entire establishment was filled with a light haze from the cooking of the food ( an hour later it was still hazy). The old was excelent.< /review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Wow riverside is moving up in the world it now has two of these in its biggest shopping centers. The seating is small but if the outside temps are below 80 the patio seating is nice . The patio has a great view of the parking lot, Taylor street and the 91 express way . This place is a little smaller than the other Habit in riverside plaza . The a/c works well with the desert climate of the IE. Parking is tuff there are five shops and one lot.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Time>1477336208717</Time>< user>

I absolutely love how the habit has delicious and affordable food, excellent wait times, and great and very friendly service! The habit has amazing music at just the right volume, and is sooooooooo unbelievably clean. I will come here every single day for the rest of my life because of how much I love the habit. I love it so much, that if they closed it down and the only habit in the whole world was in Ohio, I would pay trillions of dollars for a bite of that delicious sweet juicy burger of amazingness! The habit is the heaven on Earth!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>This restaurant is new to our area, it smells so good. The menu is simple I tried the Tri Tip Sandwich. I like it on toasted sourdough, medium rare with grilled onions. They put mayo and tomato it doesn't need the sauses they offer, the flavor is good on it's own. Try it how ever you like, The bread stays crunchy til the end of the sandwich.
If ur a fan of onion rings these are the best I've ever had, they stay crunchy also even if they sit while you eat ur sandwich. We've even tried the kids meal is good if ur short on funds, it will hit the spot. Our favorite store is the location in the Riverside Plaza. All the staff are great and the manager was very Awesome, when our order wasn't right he made sure we were satisfied. The burgers are cooked to order,and delishious. I would definitely check it out if you're near by, its habit forming.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Ordered their "sushi grade" tuna burger and they gave it to me well done. I told them that it needs to be raw in the middle so they gave me another burger. The remade burger was also well done. He looked like the manager, when I told him that it still wasnt raw in the middle he rudley  responded " thats not raw to you? Its raw." So they finally remade my burger the right way. They messed up twice and he gave me attitude. Why would a restaurant pay top dollar for sushi grade fish if they are going to cook it through? Unless the customer requested it. Sushi grade means, inspected raw fish.Suppose to be a quick sear on both sides and pink/raw in the middle. Its the basics, every restaurant does it. Burgers are good but I havent gone to it since. I see reviews for good service, sure if everything goes smoothly. Be nice and helpful when there is a issue. Mistakes happen, be cool when fixing them.<//review>< Date>
