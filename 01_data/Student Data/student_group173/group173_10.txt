<text>Love the service from the team there!  they both go out of their way to make my renting easy.  Things are very clean and well lit up and security is wonderful.  I have been there for 2 years and could not be happier.  It is more expensive then other storage units in area but, I really do feel safe working in my two units by myself.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1614803163293, 'text': 'Thank you so much for sharing the great feedback, Danielle Bell .

By far this is one of the cleanest storage facilities in Stockton. You don’t have to worry about people living in the units or rats running around everything. Debbie and James are always a pleasure to deal with and Tim was a lot of help explaining everything and setting up my unit. I will forever recommend this facility to family and friends!<//text>

Park West is a well-run, super clean facility. The managers, Debbie and James live on site and take a vested interest in keeping the facility clean, neat, and safe. They are friendly and helpful. I don't have need to store stuff at the moment, which is why I left, but if I ever have need to store things again, they will be at the top of my list.<//Text>

I needed to upgrade to a larger unit and the staff at Park West Storage was able to get me into one almost immediately. They made the transition process so easy. The facility is well maintained and the staff is friendly and efficient. I’ve never had a bad experience with them.</Review>

This was my first time renting a space, and it was very simple.

I was able to check availability and also reserve my unit online.

I was given a reservation number along with a date to move in, upon arriving to the office.

Me and my fiancée were greeted welcomingly, the office was clean and set up with hand sanitizer and protective glass.

The process was very quick and painless, after my code was chosen we checked out the unit.

It was completely clean and just as described, the location is also very ideal.

If you have the need for a storage unit this is the place to choose.< /Review>

We came here to pick up a Penske Truck we reserved online. They accidentally rented it out ugh. So why the 5 stars? The employee was obviously very concerned and truly felt bad for what happened. She started making calls immediately and found another truck for us in Modesto. When all was said and done, we got a truck and a discount for the hassle. Great customer service.<//review>

Great little winery with fine wines. Our host was Brandon? and he did a superb job, made our visit so special. This place would normally rate 5 stars except for.............

So this place has a criminal themed decor with a mini prison cell and museum; there are booking mug shots of famous criminals posted all around. Front and center, around the large fireplace are the criminal lovers Bonnie & Clyde; EXCEPT it’s not a picture of Bonnie (it’s her sister Billie Jean Parker). While there are many famous photos of Bonnie Parker I don’t believe she has an official booking mugshot, she was only arrested and place in jail once (Kemp, TX early 30’s)</Review>

<review>It's a great little winery! Nice wines at a reasonable price. Love the wine and cheese pairings at the tastings. It's nice to order their delicious charcuterie board and enjoy it with a nice bottle of wine on their lovely patio. They often have some great live entertainment on the weekends! There is also a wonderful gift shop managed by Blair that has beautiful and unique gift selections.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The pairing of wines and cheeses is something I've not experienced at any of the wineries in this area.

<review>Solitary Cellars provides a stellar wine tasting experience in every aspect. The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The wine speaks for itself and is a gem of a winery in our central valley! The cheese pairings are perfect...you literally cannot go wrong with any of the combinations. To top it all off, Solitary Cellars is openly supportive of our service men and women and correctional officers. They just keep getting better over the years! Keep it up, gentlemen!< /review><time>1573177533525< /time>< rating>

This place has great wines and a great atmosphere.   You can't go wrong with a bottle of red or white.  They also have wine accessories that are great. If you like wine, try it here and you'll love wine.  The Barbera is mine favorite but I will drink any of their wines. Highly recommend it and hope you give them a try.  Look into the wine club as well. If you sign up for it tell them I told you about it.</Review>

Absolutely the best winery in the Fresno area! Taste for yourself and I’m sure you will be impressed. The ownership and staff are great. While you’re there I recommend one of their delicious cheese plates.< /review>

<text>LOVE LOVE LOVE Solitary Cellars! You get it all here! From the spacious lawn shaded by a giant tree that holds awesome summer tribute concerts, to the inside of a jail cell and prison museum! Oh and some pretty AMAZING wines 😉  Greg & Rick (the owners) are great hosts, always welcoming and ready to chat share a glass of wine with you! And don’t forget to order one of their perfectly paired charcuterie boards! No matter if you’re coming for an event or just a casual wine tasting, you’re going to love this place!< /text>< pictures>

What an awesome place! Never thought I would be able to do a wine tasting with an ex prison guard. Today was an education in wine and prison life which was totally unexpected. The owner was wicked to chat too, would recommend this place to everyone. SW11s most wanted will be back<//Review>

Love going to Solitary for wine pickup parties and in between. Greg and Rick enjoy sharing the wines with cheese. Pick up parties are fun and a great way to meet others enjoying wine, food, and music.
Not a Chardonnay fan but enjoy Old Vine Zin, Barbera and Lifer (which is sold out).
Until next stop...Wine, Cheese, Wine!</Text>

This place is so amazing. It's like a Cheers episode. "Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name." They remember their customers and talk about real stories. It's so much fun. The wine tastings are a full 1 oz so you know its a good pour. The vibe here is just chill and fun. Their charcuterie plates are delicious and worth the price!!! They are next to APCAL so when they have concerts you can reserve a table on the patio. There is literally nothing bad i have experienced here.< /Text>

Add this great winery to your list of Must stops while in Madera. They have a great story and the wines are tasty. Ask them for the story behind the Ball and Chain.</text>

As a wine enthusiast and a member,  I do not give 5 stars lightly.  Solitary Cellars is one of the best kept secrets in the valley .From Cab’s to Zinfandel they have a wide selection of very well thought out varietals that compete with some of  the best wines in the Paso Robles region. They also have great blends like “Ball and Chain”  “Code Three” “Lifer” & “Los Grilletes”:  The best part is there is no need to travel far for great wines.  The blends are excellent,  and the Barbera is one of my favorites along with a magnificent Pino Noir. Couple that with excellent service and you will certainly have an excuse to give them a try. I'll bet you'll become members as well. Tell them Edmund sent you.< /Review>

The meat market features fresh meat which the butchers are more than happy to prepare any way you prefer. The produce is also fresh, and they always have what I'm looking for. The owners are also the operators of the market and are so friendly that my family and myself consider them as family.</review>< pictures>

This fly has been frozen in La Chona cheese. This market should clean refrigerator storage up for releasing more space in order to artificially kept cool and store veggies and fruits.

Dec. 26, 2020, Red Baron Special Deluxe Pizza has passed expiration date [and the food] is spoiled. I am going to bring these receipt and bad food for a refund because this will cause the symptoms of food poisoning. The exp. Of this food was Dec. 31, 2020. This market should also sell Seirogan Herbal Dietary here as well. Dec. 27, 2020. There were Dollars seven for refund.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2d0b804f1b06b:0xa58fd13b24096617< /Gmap_id>< time>

The BEST butcher shop in the San Gabriel Valley. Have been coming here for over 25 years. It is under new ownership and they sure have made the place alot cleaner and more accomodating. Lots of new product to offer.</Text>

Amazing customer service, really friendly store owner.  Great butcher as well as enough dry goods and produce to make it my first choice for groceries.  Peck Market is my recommendation to locals since it has better quality meat and produce than some of the larger supermarkets, and spending money here supports small business.< /Text>

It's a quick In & Out the door. Cashiers are polite and respectful. Beats going to the Supermarket and waiting for 10-15 minutes waiting in line to pick for your groceries! Or for one item.</Text>

Located in the historic Sacramento Ice Blocks on R Street, Device Brewing offers a great selection of craft beer. The atmosphere is inviting and there is a large outdoor space to enjoy the lovely valley weather. Will definitely be back!</Review>

Came here for the Happy Hour and got charged full price. The Pocket location is $3 off beers before 5. Guess it's different here.</review>

I've been going to the original location for years so its awesome to see them be able to expand like this. The location is great and the set up is good. It was day 1 so it was packed but still kids and dog friendly. Same great beers we are used to and even saw some of the same staff. Congrats guys! Excited for you!< /Review>

Friendly staff, good beer. If you're an IPA person they've got a lot of those. If you're not an IPA person(like me), your selections are more limited, but still good (get the Nitro Salted Caramel Porter)<//review>

<Text>It is such a blessing and great privilege to have a brewery of this caliber in my immediate neighborhood. I stopped in for the first time on the morning when the Croatia vs. Russia match was on. I enjoyed two different selections on tap and felt really at home in the upbeat, friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The indoor space is ample and bright, and the outdoor seating is a nice addition. This is on my list of regular hangouts now!<//Text><Time>1531078135160< /Time></record>

This place is super nice! It's a new brewery that opened recently. Its Pet friendly! The staff super nice. I had the kettle sour and I loved it! Will be coming back to get this drink again soon! Hopefully they keep brewing it. I love the outdoor sitting. And the decor.<//text>

Great location right in the Ice Block. I’ve always enjoyed Device. Usually stuck with the Kid Casual but they have a lot of great options. They have indoor and outdoor seating and are located near a lot of great restaurants. I definitely recommend stopping by here.< /review>

The standard flagships are always good, but a good, consistent West Coast IPA would be appreciated. The batches of Made In Sac have varied wildly in consistency. Set the first one aside, but the Hop, Sip and a Jump was a great replacement.<//Text>< Pics>

The new Device location is a hit for a number of reasons.  One, the prime location gives you access to do other things after drinking.  Another reason is that the beer has improved drastically since my last visit about a year ago.  Customer Service was also good, but the I wish the prices were better.</Review>

Every time I come here is a great experience. Stopped at the nearby Safeway and picked up a deli sandwich. It was just ok. Didn't really expect much. Other better food sources around. Bartender very helpful with asking my preference and guiding me to beers I would like. My flight was perfect with liking all 5 beers. Will be back soon.< /text>

The quality of the beer is amazing, and there is a pretty big selection of beers on tap. The menu is pretty IPA heavy, but there are other options too. Im happy to see Device expanding the way they are.

The Ice Block taproom is kid/dog friendly too. It has both indoor and outdoor seating, so you have options of where to sit depending on the weather.</Review>< pictures>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>I'll admit I came in distracted and without best attitude as I had just visited friend in hospital. That said... Beautiful architecture and design. Would like to visit again when it's busier 'cause it has potential, except - of 12 beers on tap, 8 were ipa's. A rice lager, a pilsner and two stouts rounded it out. Tried the dry Irish stout. Was decent. Chalkboard said $6/pint. Bartender said $6.50 and then gave me no change from $7. I'd have tipped him a buck, but if he's making his own tips then he's lucky to get fifty cents...</review>< name>

{'time': 1562854178332, 'text': "Firstly, I'm sorry to hear about your friend, and send well-wishes for a quick recovery.\n\nWe are a bit IPA-heavy with some of our special releases lately. But the truth of the matter is that when we brew traditional styles such as an amber or English mild, very few people actually order them. It's a shame, but it's the consumer who ultimately dictates the styles of beer that dominate the menu board. I'm glad you liked our dry Irish stout on nitro, it is quite lovely.\n\nRegarding the beer ringing up at $6.50, our sales tax rate in Sacramento is 8.25%, which on $6.00 will ring to $6.50 (actually $6.495, which the system will round to the nearest penny).\n\nWith regard to not recieving your change, that is not acceptable, nor is it a practice that we would ever condone. Would you please email me the date and time of your visit, and a description of the person who took your order? This will be addressed, to be certain, as customer service and ethical business practices are of utmost importance to us. devicebrewing@gmail.com\n\nI'm sorry for the day you must have had, and that we were unable to make it better. I hope you'll give us another chance sometime.\n\nAll the best,\nKen Anthony\nOwner"}<//response>

<Review>I went in for a beer to try it for the first time today at 11:30. The beer was great. But the blond working there was a real stuck up B. Absolutely no personality,  acted like we were lower forms of life. My friend, who does not drink beer ordered a Coke in the can. She asked if he wanted a glass, but rolled her eyes when he said no. NEVER going back.<//Review><username>Bill Russell<//username>< Response>

<Review>Good beer, beautiful setting.  My only critique would be to add different beer styles to have a greater selection of beer.  I love IPAs, but my lady likes Sours, Saisons, and others specialty beers, which Device doesn't have.

Ramona Park is one of the best parks in the area with a good playground for toddlers and another for older kids. There are lots of benches and tables and most are underneath awnings for shade. It’s very quiet and secluded so you can often have the whole park to yourself.< /review>

This place has an incredible craft beer, liquor and wine selection. They have a walk-in beer room, wear a jacket if your browsing. I would highly recommend this place.<//Text>

I always find great beers here in their beer cave.  Also, this is the only place I can find Pliny the Elder. They have a nice big selection of popular beers and random cool finds plus they have a cigar humidor closet thing and a bunch of wine 👍< /text>

Great for a local convenience store.  Getting in and out is easy, and so is parking.  There's never much of a line, and they sell all sorts of stuff.</text>

Great staff, very helpful.  Can place special orders although if you can't find what beer you're looking for here they will have something comparable.

Great walk in beer cooler. If you love beer then consider bringing a jacket or sweater cause it will be easy to spend 30 minutes just looking.

Please note this is just beer and wine, not full liquor.

Overall my go to place for specialty brews.</Review>

I've been shopping here for years.  I doubt there's a broader selection of beer in the area; and yeah I know about the place on Atlantic at Carson.  These folks are always friendly and neighbourhood kids come in for the soda or ice cream bar.  I like having places like this around.
Also, if they dont have your favourite brew theyll bust one to find it for you.  Support your local!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><user>114226656846574788461</user><Review>this place has been around for a while under i believe it's third ownership. it's been well known for its relatively huge walk-in fridge containing a long hallway of craft beer. if you're looking for hazy ipa, california traditional ipa, double or triple ipa, stouts, and limited release russian river pliny's and/or blind pigs this is the spot for you. always call in to check to see if they got the limiteds though. they also always showcase new independent and local breweries outside of your usual selection of stone brewing, modern times, etc. been coming here for years for my craft beer fix so i'm never disappointed. and as always check the bottle and can dates before you purchase and if you want to purchase a fresh release.< /Review>< gmapID>

<userid>108626466859356524976</userid><resp>None</resp><Review>Amazing selection of beer in the "Beer Cave". They also have a cooler of cigars. The wine selection is not as large but has a good variety, with some nicer mainstream vintners (Cakebread, Justin, Caymus etc). and also more middle of the road wine (chateau st Michel, Josh, la crema).
The cashier was also very friendly and helpful, I must note. Either they've changed staff Or the previous reviewer just caught someone on a bad day.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>The owner or cashier was very rude  and insulting.
When i asked if he had a michelada product he responded with derogatory words saying that he does not service Mexicans nor crazy people when i ask why is he saying that about Mexicans he just simply said we do not carry that here and walked away while talking on his phone< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

It's a little pricey, but their selection of COLD beer in the Beer Cave and their neighborhood closeness make this place a go-to resource when the beer fridge is empty.<//text>

The burritos are way too small for the price! I ordered a fry fish, it was rubery cold in the inside and it was not crispy. They have a sign of "HAND MADE TORTILLAS" however, they never have them.< /text>

Just passing through this little town and considering the limited options I decided to stop in. I didn't have much expectations but I was reeeeally surprised. The Pastor super burrito was fresh made, the meat was seasoned perfectly, the rice/beans had so much flavor and it hit the damn spot. I damn near crashed leaving town trying to inhale it! 2 thumbs up< /Text>

Price wise they are on the high side, but the quality and authenticity of the Mexican Cuisine they serve is well worth it. I had a Carnitas Burrito Supreme, Fries, and a Pork Tamale and I must say it was divine. If you can afford the price, I recommend you try anything on their menu. Customer service was excellent and very helpful in assisting me in deciding what I wanted to eat. They go the extra mile to make sure their customers are satisfied.</Text>

<Name>Joe Fernandez</Name><Review>Never been really impressed with this place, but when you live in the sticks you don't have much choice. So I gave it another try. First off I paid $16 for two tacos and a bean, yes bean no meat burrito with a horchata.  $16 bucks, just me.  Not a meal, alacart.  No waiters, paper plates.  Bean burrito!!!!  I should have said WTF and walked away when he said the price, but I was really hungry.  Then the food came and it was kind of a disappoinment, but then o remembered why we do t come her often.  Okay I think I've learned my lesson now.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>2<//Rate>< userid>

This is probably the best Mexican food you can get in Linden. Price is a bit high and some stuff is better than others.</review>

Food was really greasy ordered a burrito with extra meat but instead the just loaded it with extra rice meat also had no flavor, on top of everything theres only kid running the restaurant not one was over 18. I will never eat that this place again! Neither should anyone else.<//review>

The park is cool, it's decent, the bowl is better then most around. Good park to just skate, nothing too crazy though. Unfortunately you do have to pay for lights with quarters only, which is ridiculous because the parking lot lights stay lit all night. Sometimes the gate gets unlocked around 8am in summer months, sometimes the maintenance guy don't show up till 11am!.  Most of the people who come here are generally nice, restrooms aren't very nice for the females. There are a lot of local skaters who skate here regularly, and unfortunately there's also a lot of small kids who get dropped off while their mom or dad sits in the car. Most of the smaller kids here don't watch out for other riders, they Mostly go in circles and cut in front of everybody. While their parents just watch, and honestly whenever someone tells one of these kids to watch out for others, that's when their parent comes into the park usually trying to intimidate other kids. Please learn to ride whatever it is that you choose at home before going to skateparks, it's helps everyone. Parents should know better when they see their kid playing in the bowl while everybody's waiting to actually ride it, and get em out, these parks aren't playgrounds......J.D.🛹🛹🛹🍃🍻< /Review>

<Review>This is a place for all ages who enjoys skateboarding. There are BBQ's, a LARGE patio area surrounded by green grass , (public) facilities, parking, and also lighted skateboarding arena (coins not included). Limited space not sure how to reserve, I assume parks/recreation would likely have answers..< /Review>< Name>

SKATEPARK REVIEW ONLY:BMX PERSPECTIVE:
This park is not a bad park at all. It's not the best  Ut if your within 2 hrs which is kinda pushing it. It's worth a trip. The bowl has some nice vert that once you get comfortable can be very nice. Bowl to bowl spine is moderate size, bigger than most places about 5ish feet maybe bigger but its steepish. The taller quarter in the street section is nice for airing out as well. All in all it's a great little park to get creative and have some fun. I was told that the lights no longer work, THESE ARE LIES LOL THE LIGHTS WORK. you have to pay for it though, I assume if your quarters dont work right away, try try try. It spits them out the bottom if it doesn't go through. You'll find a few riders from time to time. COME OUT AND RIDE!!< /Text>

<Review>Been at jurpa rec center twice for my grandson karate class and police have been at skate park both times would rather see skate park closed down would never recommend this to anyone you don't even deserve one star maybe a minus 50 would be the best rating for this place also to much smoking allowed really healthy don't think so shut this place down.< /Review>< pictures>

Great customer service. Delicious Cobb salad & nuggets made with real chicken. We also tried their Mac & cheese - Delicious. Their brownie comes warm & it melts in your mouth pairs well with their ice cream.</Review>

<text>I really only like the chicken egg and cheese biscuit at Chick-fil-A but I got there at 10:32am and breakfast had just ended. Since I was stuck in the line, I ordered the grilled chicken club. To my surprise, it wasn't bad at all. I wished the bacon was crispier but they told me they couldn't make it well done. I would get the grilled chicken club again but I'm really going to try and make sure I get there before 1030am for the breakfast sandwich.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

Very efficiently organized. I got worried a little bit when the staff just zigzags their way between cars on the order line. Didn't know how they will sort out their orders. But they have another staff at the end of the line before window pick up to verify order. Then staff will bring your food to your car. Very fast, efficient and food still taste delicious!</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Terrible. I ordered via the app two 8 count meals included sauce in the order. I get back to my room no sauce for either meals. Someone tell me how do you eat chick fil a without sauce. I call the restaurant to ask the manger for a refund or to accommodate us. Her response we can reward you with a side.
After waiting 20 mins for a curbside order.

The manger has no skills to defuse a situation if I could give -0 stars I would.

This is coming from a former chick fil a employee.</review>< Pictures>

<text>This is thr only Chic-fi-la that I continue to have a problem with.  Every other one gives you a full cobb salad this one is always give half and lack of chicken.

My chicken sandwich was missing bacon I waited in line to return it for 20 mins she walks out with cold bacon in a cup to place on my sandwich and now my entire sandwich is cold.

The people are friendly but the qaulity sucks< /text>< pictures>

<text>Chick-fil-A hardly EVER disappoints in terms of service and food quality. The location is a bit suboptimal. The drive thru is located right around the corner and backs out into the intersection during peak hours. They have recently closed off one of the drive thru exits, so you're pretty much forced to sit in your car even after you've received your food. It's a bad bottleneck in an already bottlenecked situation.<//text>< Pictures>

Drive-thru situation is awful at times it just depends on when you go. mobile orders take way too long to be ready for counter or curbside pickup which is why I originally opted out to the drive-thru pickup cuz I thought it would be faster and it still is even with the god-awful lines< /review>

It gets a bit tight going around big vehicles that are parked next to the drive-thru on the bottom level.</Review>

It's Chick-fil-a... They're pretty consistent. The workers were friendly as usual. Soggy fries by the time I got back to my hotel to eat my food. I've never really been a fan of un-crispy waffle fries. I'm liking the addition of Mac and cheese as a side for a change of scenery.< /Review>

You normally give a place a few chances. This Chick-fil-A is a nightmare. I’m not sure they understand why people order ahead. The 3 times I’ve been each time I’ve placed a curbside pickup at least 15 minutes ahead of time. I get to the restaurant and Mark that I’m there and have to wait another 10-20 minutes. Meanwhile the drive thru line seems to just breeze through</review>

Maria is very slow and they lack common sense such as putting multiple, soggy paper bagged food that belongs to one order all into 1 plastic bag to go.</Review>

<Text>Very unorganized drive-thru during lunch hours.  The food doesn’t take too long unless you have a big order.

The service here for the first several months was not close to my past experiences with Chick-fil-A but they seem to have improved in that department, however they seem to still struggle to get orders right at this location. Deciding to post since it's been multiple times now, specifically tonight I order no pickles and cheese had two people tell me my order correctly and then I get a sandwich with extra pickles. They also consistently ignore my request for light ice on any drinks for pretty much any time I visit. Love Chick-fil-A and happy they finally got more locations in South Bay so hoping they improve their service.<//text>

The parking is a little tricky when I tried curbside pickup, so I'll keep doing the drive-thur option. It's easier to get to the left turn lane onto Maple.< /review>< pictures>

Food was delicious, but the portion sizes were a lot smaller than other Chick-fil-A restaurants. My fry container was only 2/3 full. My tenders were puny. Even ordering a 4 count tender meal with fries and a drink, I was still hungry! Usually I'm mostly full after the same meal at other locations. For $10 on fast food, I expect to be full!< /Text>

Slow!
Yes there is almost always a line but in addition to that the service can be very slow.
Staff is nice though.< /Text>

I have never had a bad meal at chick fil a until now. Chicken was old and overcooked. It hurt my gums to even bite on the nuggets. Not sure how they have such a long line and things aren’t fresh. Super disappointed.<//Text>

<Review>Being a life long resident of El Segundo, I'm sorry to report how disappointed I am with this Chick-fil-A in my home town, the total experience was horrible. The food is okay, but the drive thru is the worst....I wouldn't recommend coming here, as there are many other / better choices.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b17118adfa2f:0x45593851415b5688< /gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

This place has the weakest staff.  Got rotten yogurt for breakfast.  Had missing egg an order last week.  Week before they forgot the bacon.  Another time charged for three sandwiches instead of two.

Never comming back here.  Once season starts, and you're off to being 6-29 in the first quarter, it's obvious you didn't put work in.</text>

My wife's chicken fingers were really small.  Much smaller than normal.  Not sure if it was a one off problem or this location isn't as good as usual.  Also they were not even warm.< /Review>

This location is experiencing growing pains at least I hope.

Food quality was on par to other CFAs so the star rating is relative to better experiences.

Arrived at the start of lunch time rush, line inside was only halfway to the door but still only had two cashiers working. 10 mins to put in order and 16 mins to receive food, seems like the norm as there were plenty of people sitting and waiting for their food. By the time I left, line was to the door and drive thru line had overflowed onto the street, which along with blocking traffic also blocks those that just want to park in the parking lot.

I plan to reassess in the future to see if improvements have been made.

4/14/20 Update: while their setup for curbside pick up, I beat the lunch time rush and my order came out incorrect. Ordered and paid for spicy chicken sandwich but received an original chicken sandwich< /review>

<review>I love Chick-Fil-A, but the parking lot,and drive through at this location is horrible. It needs to be redone. The wait time is really long, needs more employees.

I went back on 4/22/2020, the worst cobb salad I have ever had. I will not be back to this chick fil a, the salad felt like it was made days ago, and there was only 3 piecee of chicken. Did not taste fresh at all. Absolutely horrible.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Rude service. I know there are growing pains but the owner of this location has been doing this for 7 years In Santa Barbara and all she has to show for it is angry Santa Barbara residents. Guess El Segundo decided to find the worst franchisee they could to take the spot.< /review>

Worst Chick Fil A i ever been too not coming back. Literally i never have gone to a fast food restaurant and been told not to sit down because it makes it hard for them to find the person who is dining in. Never heard of such thing. Slowest service ever as well the person taking my order literally had me standing for a while to get my drink.<//review>

We waited in line for a while then the line started moving, it split into 3 and we were confused on where to go. We unfortunately picked the only alone that wasn’t for the drive thru and they told us we had to go to the back of the long line so we left. Never going again.<//Text>

Nothing more needs to be said about Chick-fil-A. While I respect their reason to be closed on Sundays, one still needs to eat!< /review>
