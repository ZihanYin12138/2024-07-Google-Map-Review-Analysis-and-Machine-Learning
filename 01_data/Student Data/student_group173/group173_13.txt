I love the store because there is so much that you can get. I like also that they except EBT, and it’s a really fun place to go because you do not need a card or anything like that you can literally just go in and go out. What I love about this place is that everything is so beautifully organized for example there is stuff like canned foods, to frozen foods, and more. Also you can also get other stuff like home supplies like soap and drain cleaner and clothes wash. What I like about this place is that the prices are really good as in really low, but the quality still stays high. I go to these places I feel like I am shopping at the best of the best but honestly it’s just how the store is and that’s what I love. Also another really cool thing is that you can buy stuff like canteens here and plastic water bottles that are reusable. Another amazing thing I saw when I was leaving was that there was umbrellas that they were giving out and I think that is really amazing because this is just meant to be a grocery store not an everything store.</Text>

I enjoy shopping at smart & final. You can find bulk items at very reasonable prices. They have a very good meat selection they have paper cups and plastic plates for party supply they have extra big servings of essential items. There's eggs,milk,cereals. They also sell dog food and very large bags. I was amazed to see the size of bacon packages that they sell along with big packages of cheese and Coffee-Mate for your coffee. I found the sales associate extremely helpful and cheerful.</text>

<Text>This store was pretty-much as expected, but had to ask to fond the location of fresh meat (advertised chicken).   It was in front, in the produce section, not in back with the frozen chicken.  Unexpected.  Driving out of this business into busy traffic is kinda' scary.   Frequently visibility  of on-coming traffic is obstructed by large parked vehicles along this busy thoroughfare.  Be careful and ready to quickly accelerate up to fast street speed.<//Text>< time>

Alcohol won't be sold after 8pm you better be at the register at 8 or you can't purchase alcohol, even after you get there a second after the mean person anounces it. Too bad sir, go drive somewhere else and waste your gasoline. I'm never going to a smart and final. I guess you can say I got smart and my decision is final.< /Review>

Great customer service! They called me over three times to keep me updated on a procedure they were performing on my two senior pups. I switched over to this office from the canoga park location in pet smart, they were to small and staff are rude.< /Review>

3.5 stars. Just very busy even if you have a specific time. They do take good care of your pets. If you're not part of the wellness plan, it's extremely exquisite cuz its already expensive with the wellness plan< /Text>

Two stars are for the doctors alone, they are great but minus one star for the front of house staff (not all as some are very pleasant when you check in, but most have been rude when I ask questions wanting up front costs and left me on hold multiple times so long it goes to voicemail) and the fact that they don’t let you have appointments with your dog (-1) so you drop your pet off and everything is telephoned. I pay for the wellness plan which ends up being just about $600 a year they sell you on the fact that the cost of the appointment and that vaccinations (only some) are included however every little thing down to nail clipping is not included in the annual exam.  I have had to pay extra every appointment, even my groomers include the cost to express her glands in the visit cost but not Banfield it will cost you $37 more and you want nails trimmed that will be $18. It’s a corporation and they are about making money, there is a sincere lack of humanity and extra layer of care. Not the staffs fault it’s how the business model is set up. My dog is like my child and because of this I am cancelling my wellness plan and taking her to a real vets office where I can actually have a relationship with the vet and get transparency of costs without having to pay a monthly premium. If you take your dog in often for check ups this might be the place for you, but it’s no longer good for me and my pet.< /Text>

< Review>
I scheduled an appointment for my 4 month old kitten, Onyx, online last week. I was offered the free office visit. Onyx has been sick so I knew the entire visit would be costly and was thankful for the free office visit for first time patients.  We take Onyx to the doctor, and the doctor seemed knowledgeable and polite.
HOWEVER, WHEN THE ITEMIZED BILL ARRIVED AFTER IT WAS PAID... they charged for the office visit. I asked for the credit for the office visit as promised during my initial scheduling the appointment.  I was told "It was too late. I should have given them the coupon at the beginning of the appointment. "

HERE'S THE THING: I received an email reminding me of my complimentary 1st patient visit on today at 2 p.m. So, SOMEONE knew it was supposed to be free of charge. My baby is sick. He needed to be seen anyway. BUT, THIS PLACE LIED!!! IT'S A SCAM!!! THEY LIE TO GET YOU SCHEDULED AND THEN CHARGE YOU!!!

DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION!!! LIARS!!!!< /Review>

Advantages for me, whenever there is a complication with my pet's. I can get an answer from a physician right away, if it minor or severe Banfield has been there.
Wish they had a hospital program for critical  situations.  Great Service!!!!<//text>

I am not even accusing banfield of wrong doing, I am just wanting to cancel my plan to avoid being charged further. You do not pay for a persons insurance premium after they pass, it is unspeakably cruel to continue to charge me.

I've been going there for a year now. The care my dog gets (along with the way I'm received) is always heartwarming and caring. When I have questions, Dr Del Pino always addresses them with patience and details that put me at ease (especially with a recent surgery he had that was quite involved). From the staff all the way up, I can't say enough good things. Plus, the place is always immaculately clean and, with the plan we have, I rarely have out of pocket. And, when I do, it's the plan price, which is more reasonable than non - plan.< /Text>

<Text>Staff is amazing, friendly and knowledgeable, they make you feel less anxious when taking your pet to the back.  But my doctor is no longer with them so I was assigned to a new doctor who after examining my dog, she called me and told me his liver enzymes were Slightly higher than normal, so I told her that this has been the case since I adopted my dog.  Then she said his kidney levels were high so I asked what’s that from, her answer was from too much protein, and I had just fed my dog before I went to the vet as the appointment was at 6pm.. so I couldn’t let him starve all day if I wasn’t instructed to make him fast, so she asked what did I feed him, told her he only eats lean meat with his kibbles otherwise he won’t eat his kibbles and that he is a picky dog, she asked what kind of meat, so I said lean meat, such as fillet mignon or other, she gasped and told me oh then you should do the test for kidney test it’s only 29.00
Something, and I do get upset when the vet automatically tries to sell tests instead of giving me advise on what to do to make this lower and fix the problem even when I told her that I had to feed him before we came to the appointment, she said well he is a small dog and doesn’t need allot of protein, and she said that she still can do the test for kidney disease with the small blood sample she has, instead of telling me to reduce the protein amount and test again afteR to make sure, She also mentioned the amount, and since I got upset I told her I can not afford that test at the moment, and her judgmental answer was:  “well you can afford to feed him fillet mignon but you cannot afford the test?”
First of all I wanted to tell her it’s non of her business but I’m a shy person and cannot be rude like that but that was my first thought but told her that I was a chef and I have access to lean meat plus it no ones business how I can afford the meat for my dog!! Instead of being a vet and telling me that it’s ok we can text him again after changing his diet, she judges me!  I’m just writing this review to show the difference about vets and that this one is a sales person not a vet who actually cares about the dogs wellbeing!  Dr Wrenn, if you can’t afford fillet mignon, don’t judge people who sacrifice to give their babies or pets what they love to eat! Maybe if you are more compassionate and actually care for your pet petite ya, you’ll have more patients and make more money to afford the fillet mignon which goes for $11.00 a lb and can feed my small breed dog for a week! 🤬😡🤬</Text>< user>

A few years ago I took in my cat BJ for several visits and ultimately had to put him down due to inoperable cancer that had progressed too quickly to be treated where he could have a decent life. Throughout the entire ordeal, the whole staff cared for & loved on my grumpy cat, and even with the painful experience of putting him to sleep, I felt their care - for both of us. Because of the *heart* that shined through, even though I might find slightly more inexpensive care elsewhere, I wouldn't dream of doing so. BJ's vet, Dr. Song is no longer there as far as I'm aware but the staff that remains continues the exemplary care I saw during her tenure.

Banfield, and this location in particular, will always be my go-to vets for my babies ❤</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1582151603667, 'text': 'Hello Suzie - We appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts about Dr. Song and the Northridge staff.

Took my new 9 week old Golden Retriever puppy on 03/13/20 for her first check up/ 2nd shots. Dr. Renn at the Northridge Banfield, was the one to check her, asked her regular questions. My puppy had ONLY diarrhea and slept non stop for 2 days, didn’t really eat much or drink. I thought because of change of food and normal puppy behavior, I didn’t really think much of it. Anyways, Dr. gave her a parvo test and she was positive and she and the nurse explained what it was and how lots of dogs don’t make it, etc. They gave me the option to do inpatient treatment only but was not a guarantee that she would make it. Told me in a few days my puppy was going to get worse, just to wait it out and eventually she will pass away. Dr. Renn rushed out of the room when she said she was contaminated and didn’t return. The nurse did come back to check up on us and made a comment that the DR. didn’t want to euthanize my puppy that day because she was still up and alive, SMH!

I took my puppy home, I was devastated but didn’t want to give up. I started researching home remedies, gave her pedialyte just to keep her hydrated. She kept playing, eating, drinking, no vomit, but again ONLY diarrhea. On 03/16 I came home from work and diarrhea was still there but it had blood in it. I took her to VCA emergency and I was there for 4 hours but it was the best thing I did. They gave me outpatient treatment and HOPE. Throughout her treatment at home, not once did she show any other symptom of Parvo. Diarrhea cleared in 2 days. My Nala got cleared of Parvo already and in a few days will be getting her continuous round of shots. She is strong and has parents that didn’t give up on her.

I’m writing this review now because I needed to wait it out to make sure my baby made it. This is not a review to bash Bandfield or the DR. but this happened and it shouldn’t be left unknown. I hope to anyone reading this always gets a 2nd opinion if you can.</Text>

I have to admit that I'm typically not a person who would take my pets to a vet inside a pet store.  But Banfield isn't even in the same league.....We LOVE Banfield!!!!  We normally see Dr. Nardi in Canoga Park, but since she's on maternity leave we started coming to Northridge (and it's closer to home!). Every employee I've come in contact with has been exceptionally knowledgeable, patient & friendly.  Our younger dog, Brit was spayed and they called several times to ask how she was doing.....I'll be honest and say it would impress me if my own doctor did this!!  They always do their best to get an appointment for us as soon as possible, or they set up a "drop off " for the next day.

If you're looking for a good vet, give Banfield a shot.  And their Wellness Plans?  With my 2 dogs it saved us close to $1,000 just for when they were spayed.  No fee for office visits.  I think we pay $30/mo each dog.<//Text>

They didn't have some vape stuff I was looking for before but they were willing to order it for you to come in soon so really accommodating.. oh and they have these really cool real crystal pipes and manager is also really cool..< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Ill stick to lala land this place does not accept returns even if you only used it once to try it and clean it to look brand new and return it the next day. lala land actually excepts returns as long as its in like brand new condition meaning they get to at least try the product before making it a final sale. so im staying away from this place they basically robbed me $60 if i knew there was no returns i would have never gone here in the first place. The guy says they do accept returns as long as you come in the next day which i did but told no returns even though he said they do accept returns. This place says one thing but then says another. Get your story right either you accept returns or not period.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Horrible customer service. Not knowledgeable of their own products. Way overpriced. I would not recommend this shop to anyone. I asked for a RPM coil, he didn't what they were. I told him I see the box right behind you. I asked to see the front of the box 3 times to see if they were the ones I wanted. He then tried to school me on the product, which was ridiculous. I asked how much for the box of 5, he said $35+. These go for $20 anywhere else. This was a horrible experience. First and last time I come here.
Update:
The owner wrote back a reply to my post and since deleted it because she/he thought they were dealing with someone uneducated. I made sure that wasn't the case.< /review>

<Review>Love this place, always friendly and great customer service! Not to mention best prices and selection around. Half of the places around here either over charge or just don’t have what you’re looking for. With puff and pass I’ve always been very pleased especially with their selection in vape pens and glass. I’d rhighly recommend checking this place out before anywhere else.</Review>< Pictures>

Did not find that to be good business.</Text>

Widowed at age 54, I was distraught and turned to Robert Mansour to help me create an estate plan from scratch. Rob competently and thoroughly explained the living trust and walked me through the options to create a plan that exactly fit my needs. He gave me great real-life examples to make things very clear. He was compassionate and the process was stress-free. Now, my kids' future is protected. I highly recommend the Law office of Robert Mansour for estate planning and family trust services.< /text>

Extremely knowledgeable, patient, thorough, thoughtful, and highly professional - In a nutshell, this was my experience with Robert Mansour and his associates.

Contacting an attorney is nerve wracking enough (at least for me) and I’ve had to deal with quite a few for various services. Contacting Rob’s office and setting up an appointment was the most seamless and, dare I say, “enjoyable” call that I’ve had to make in a while. Maria answered the phone and took down all the relevant information that Rob would need in order to help me with my situation. Specifically, pertaining to Proposition 19 and its impact on inherited property. I had NO idea what to ask about specifically but Maria was very patient and made my ramblings into coherent notes. She said that she would discuss with Robert when he was free and get back to me about setting up an appointment, which she did in less than 30 minutes.

During the call with Rob, he could not be easier to speak with yet still very direct-to-the-point. Rob let me know what he thought my concerns were and, once I confirmed that I agreed, he went through his recommended solutions/options. Beyond his legal advice, Rob also leveraged his experience to let me know about certain pitfalls that might happen based upon family dynamics, emotions, etc. I truly appreciated his sharing his experiences with me since these issues never had occurred to me… things like how family dynamics might be great now, but money has a way of changing that, issues that can arise during probate if you are not comfortable addressing uncomfortable issues like certain assets and how they should be inherited and by whom, etc. It was this part of our call that I found most helpful and proved to me that Rob’s experience and his ability to personalize "legalese” would prove invaluable.

Unfortunately, Rob was not able to take my case because I live in a county far away from his practice and he felt that I would be better served with a more local attorney, one that would be more familiar with the nuances of the county in which I live. I really appreciated his honesty and candor. It turned out that he was correct because there are certain processes and procedures in our county that are slightly different from the counties that Rob currently serves.

Frankly, it was such a positive experience, I just might try to convince my wife that we need to move to Santa Clarita during our golden years just so that we can have Rob do our estate planning! ;)</Text>

I have nothing, but great things to say about Robert Mansour and his team. He does his industry right. They are honest, trustworthy and truly there to help you when you need it. I can honestly say I would trust him with my affairs and recommend him to anyone looking. After working with them through numerous obstacles they are always there and working as hard as they can. They don't let things slip through the cracks and are the best people to have in your corner.<//text>

I am extremely happy with the service provided by Robert Mansour and his staff. Robert presents information in a clear, easy to understand format. He takes the time to really make sure you understand the reasoning behind each decision. It was a pleasure working with him and I would highly recommend his firm to anyone needing Wills & Trusts.<//Review>

<text>We hired Robert Mansour to put together our family trust and he did a wonderful job - everyone in his office is outstanding. We recently had a question on another matter, and after reviewing some documents and letting us know his thoughts, we determined there was no need to meet. I asked for an invoice and he told us it wasn't necessary in this case as it didn't take him much time to review the documents. We have the utmost confidence and trust in Robert Mansour and his Law Office. We just referred our son to him to create his trust. Highly recommend this firm.< /text>< pics>

From day one that I met Robert and his staff I felt the care and sincerity that they were willing to put into my case. They definitely proved themselves and the outcome of my case exceeded my expectations. Thank you for all your hard work and kindness.
All my thanks for everything you've done

I expected that creating a Living Trust and Will would be a sobering experience.  It was not!  Robert made the experience (dare I say) enjoyable and very informative. Robert was very personable and easy to work with.  I  don't think there is any substitute for a real professional. Robert is that.<//text>

This has literally taken me a few years, but they say better late than never!!! I highly recommended Robert Mansour. He’s very attractive and never rushes a meeting. He won our sons case and we couldn’t be happier! Thank you for fighting for justice.<//text>

<Review>A the beginning of 2019, my wife and I chose the Law Office of Robert Mansour to assist us with our first family trust. Given our complete lack of experience with such legal matters, I cannot stress enough how important a simple and concise explanation of one's options can be. Mr. Mansour was excellent at explaining these options, along with the pros and cons of each choice in a very clear and easy to understand manner.

Very professionally, Rob and his staff helped to guide us through all of the necessary steps for our trust. He prepared all appropriate paperwork and legal filings, keeping us updated on progress. Our official signing was on schedule.

We are extremely happy with the end result, which was professionally presented in both hard copy and electronic form. We can't thank Mr. Mansour and his team enough for their thorough and professional advice and service. Highly recommended.

He didn't pressure me into going into the office or setting anything up. He started the conversation by getting to know my situation and its' circumstances, asking proper questions along the way. He was able to answer any and all of my questions with ease & gave me very helpful knowledge throughout the 22 minute phone call, which he generously took the time out of his busy day for.

<text>Very professional, great staff and incredible service!

Thank you for taking care of my mom's affairs and getting them all in order for her. After her diagnosis it was one of the first things she thought about. It gave her some peace to have it all done the correct way. Robert and staff took the time to answer all question and help lay out a plan with sensitivity and patience.

Mansour for assistance with my daughter's auto accident case.  Even though the accident occurred 18 months ago, I wanted to get an attorney's opinion on the settlement offer we had received from the insurance company.  The response I received from Rob and his assistant , Marie, was prompt and professional,  as I expected.  But, the best part  is that they are truly kind, caring and genuine.  Rob set  up a phone consultation for FREE and spent 30 minutes discussing the case and provided a course of action to improve the settlement from the insurance company, all at no charge.  How REFRESHING!  For sure, he will be the first attorney I call if I am in need of legal service again</review>< userid>

Robert Mansour is the best!  Before I talked with him about my possible problems and fears concerning my Trustee duties, I was a borderline nervous wreck.  I was worried about my not-so-nice brother giving me major problems with the money that we inherited from my Mom's estate.  But thank God I was referred to Robert Mansour, who led me through each and every matter, giving me solid, sensible, and professional legal advice on every important matter pertaining to ME and MY safety and well-being as Trustee!  I feel so much better, thank you, Robert, you're the bomb!<//Review>

I can't say enough about Mr. Mansour and his incredible staff.  He was there for me every step of the way to the bitter end.  I don't think if I had anyone else in my corner I would have had the outcome I did. If you need someone to fight the good fight he us the one to call on.  I could go on forever he is just that good.< /Review>

<text>A few years ago my wife was diagnosed with an advanced form of brain cancer.  One of the things we needed to do was make legal arrangements.  I am so grateful that we found Robert and his incredible staff.  He guided us through everything in an extremely thorough, knowledgeable, and compassionate way.  They were also aware of the time sensitive nature of things with my wife's progressive brain cancer and helped expedite everything while she was still very much able to participate in the process.  These kind of arrangements can be uncomfortable in the best of circumstances, and in our case they were of an even more imminent nature.  I couldn't have been happier with how the entire process was handled.  I would recommend Robert and his office to anyone.  Our sincerest appreciation goes out to them.<//text>< resp>

I found the Law Office of Robert Mansour through all these wonderful reviews. I needed some legal advice regarding my mother's accident and Robert was able to speak to me the same day of my inquiry and was thorough, honest, and extremely informative. The staff is also very pleasant.
I felt such great relief after speaking with Robert and will definitely give them a call in the future for any legal matters.< /Text>

Robert Mansour  represented my brother-in-law in a auto versus pedestrian case. My brother-in-law had started with another attorney, who didn’t provide any help. We turned it to Robert and found someone who was very efficient, and very easy to talk to. He said at the beginning that he wasn’t sure how much compensation my brother-in-law would receive, but he said that he has a policy that the client will receive more than he will.  Robert and his staff kept us informed of any changes, or progress in his case. My brother-in-law received more that he hoped for. We are very thankful for Robert. He is very professional, and we would highly recommend him to anyone else that is considering hiring an attorney<//review>

By far the best attorney and staff! The entire office made an unfortunate event easy to deal with. They take care of you and keep you updated the entire time. I’ve dealt with other offices where it’s impossible to find out what’s going on with your case, but Rob and his staff inform you of everything that’s going on. I can not rave enough about their services. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel like they’re in good hands with an attorney they can trust.<//Text>

<Review>Robert and his staff are a godsend. They are so compassionate and they will hold your hand through the whole process. When you go through an ordeal that is life changing and you need somebody that will fight for you and for the justice that you deserve, I would go the Law Office of Robert Mansour.  If I had a question there was always somebody there to give me an answer right away without having to wait for days for a live person to get back to me. Robert is honest, compassionate and a very straight forward person and to me that was important. I didn’t want somebody that would sugar coat the process and the challenges that filing a law suit would bring.  There were no hidden agendas and his concern for what I was going through was genuine and I always felt that I was important and not just another case file. I was constantly informed of any updates that pertained to my case and kept in the loop so I never felt that nothing was being done. If you ever get into a bind that you need to seek legal advice, I would totally recommend the Law Office of Robert Mansour.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I'm an attorney, and Robert Mansour is my Estate Planning attorney.  Being an attorney myself, I easily recognize the level of expertise another professional has in his/her chosen practice area and Robert is the best of the best.  He answers all my questions with the ease that only comes with years of practice.  Outside of the legal knowledge, he is compassionate, responsive, and a true professional all around.

My firm refers Estate Planning cases to him exclusively.  It's a reflection on our practice also and I'm proud he is in my community.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I'm a fellow attorney from Minnesota and retained Rob and his firm to assist my parents, who live in Californina, with estate planning issues.  Rob's work product, attention to details, and vast experience in estate planning was so helpful and effective.  My parents and I appreciated Rob's practical approach to resolving the issues confronting us.  He went out of his way to make sure that all of our concerns and questions were adequately addressed, and he explained everything in a simplified manner for us to understand the intricacies of what needed to be done to achieve our goals. I wholeheartedly recommend Rob to anyone who is looking for legal representation for their estate planning needs.  Thank you Rob for your guidance and counsel.<//text><user_name>Phong Luong<//user_name>< user_id>

I met Robert Mansour eight years ago when he prepared my estate plan.  As life’s twists and turns are often unpredictable, I had the need to meet with him again recently to review my plan and make significant changes.   Robert’s kind nature makes approaching such an important exercise as preparing an estate plan an effortless task.   He presents the material with clarity, information, patience and a sense of humor.  During the process he spends the time necessary to educate you as to the choices in front of you, and the ramifications of your decisions.  Also, an important note, everyone on his office staff is prompt at returning calls, making appointments and answering questions.  What peace of mind! I hold Robert Mansour in the highest professional regard, and recommend him without reservation.<//Text>

<text>Excellent! We highly recommend Robert Mansour. Robert’s professional services were excellent and he delivered the product as promised before a very tight due date. Robert kept us up to date throughout the process and promptly responded to any questions we had. Robert’s advice and clear explanations along the way were very useful for us. This is a true professional at the highest standards at a very reasonable rate.< /text>< Pics>

<gmap_id>0x80c27de1f2212517:0xc322ca56b2235b2d<//gmap_id><Review>I was recommended to Robert Mansour for the estate planning my husband and I had been meaning to do for years because he BREAKS THE PROCESS DOWN INTO EASY STEPS. Wow, was that true! I only regret I didn't find out about him sooner and get things in order for our kids earlier. I feel so much better.

Mr. Mansour was amazingly personable, serious yet light-hearted and all we had to do was fill out a questionnaire and have a one hour conference call. Our documents were prepared quickly for electronic review then he sent us official documents, we signed/notarized and we were done! We also went with a living trust instead of just a will which Mr. Mansour similarly demystified for us. Great experience, we highly recommend him.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My experience with the Law Office of Robert Mansour and estate planning has been great .  Rob helped with a very complicated situation, taking all the time necessary to address my concerns and never made me feel like I was taking too much of his time (and I'm sure I probably did!!!) He listened to my needs and offered options while explaining everything in terms easily understood.  He is very professional yet has a good sense of humor and easy to talk to.  I really appreciate that he makes himself accessible for any concerns any time. I would highly recommend his services.</Review>< UserId.>

<review>I was recommended to Robert by my chiropractor last year when I was involved in a large accident- at the other person's fault. I couldn't be happier with the service. I had an initial meeting with him soon after the accident and he broke everything down for me so well. I had never gone to a lawyer before for an accident related case and was only 23 when it happened, so I was lucky to find someone who is genuine and will truly work hard for you!
Just a truly nice person who doesn't cheat you out of anything. Communication was great also- any time I had questions, they were promptly and well answered. He's been so nice and supportive to me for everything and I'm truly grateful!
I definitely recommend him and his office to anyone who is looking for a good lawyer :)<//review>< GmapID>

We asked Robert Mansour to review our existing estate plan. Our old plan was written at least 10 years prior. We also found that the attorney who provided our previous document had been disbarred!  Mr. Mansour's review was extremely thorough. Our previous document had not been fully executed, nor did we truly understand all of it. Mr. Mansour took great care to understand what we wanted and help us achieve an estate plan that works for us and our family. The updated plan was presented in an organized notebook with instructions that are easily understood, MUCH better than our previous document. He and his very pleasant and efficient staff have made us feel like family. I highly recommend them.

Recently, I asked Robert for advice regarding an insurance settlement for a motor vehicle accident. We talked about the problem, and I provided a large folder of information which he reviewed. He spent over an hour on the phone discussing options and offered advice - all without charge. We are very happy we found Robert Mansour and his staff. They are truly caring professionals.<//Text>

<Text>Robert was very helpful and informative and was patient with all of my questions. He made what can be a very overwhelming and intimidating experience much easier and allowed me to focus on the important decisions I was making instead of being overwhelmed with the legality of the process.  I would highly recommend Robert to anyone who needed estate planning or legal services. He was kind and genuine and truly is someone I could trust and will trust for my future legal needs and questions.  Robert went far above and beyond my expectations and made me feel at home and comfortable through the entire process while displaying the needed legal expertise and availability to assist me with all of my legal needs.</Text><Date>1411678292063</Date>< Rating>

Mr. Robert Mansour is an exceptional and professional attorney.

Mr. Mansour is very caring, honest, courteous and knowledgable.  He has a welcoming and professional staff to help his clients.

< review>
My car was totaled after a teenager was playing with his phone and slammed into my stopped car.  I attempted to work with his insurance company, State Farm, but was given the run around... even after they accepted liability.  They treated me like a criminal from day one, more interested in getting the case off their books than listening to what I had to say.

I required medical attention and State Farm expected for me to pay for all services then submit my bills for their "approval."  At that point I contacted Robert Mansour... it was the last time I had to deal with State Farm.  He arranged for my medical care and dealt with the insurance company, taking that headache away from me.

After all was said and done, not only did State Farm pay for my medical bills, I walked away with some extra cash for all the trouble I had to deal with.  I never hired a lawyer before to deal with such an issue, but I am very happy I hired Robert and his staff.<//review>

I highly recommend Robert and his professional team to handle your personal injury / car accident case.  From the very beginning he was supportive understanding my injuries, work and personal concerns.  My car accident occurred in October 2015, less than 3 months after I purchased a new Dodge Charger, when another car decided to make an illegal U-turn causing a head on collection. I turned to Robert and his team to help me in getting my life back on track, because after an accident every day is a challenge.   His team was vital not only in getting the professional medical care I needed to recover, but also helping me out with auto insurance adjusters in getting my car back to its original running condition.  Robert and his team went out of their way to make sure my medical needs were met and everything was taken care of in a timely manner.  I can’t say “Thank You” enough!!</Text>

Robert Mansour is an excellent attorney.  I've used him to deal with several legal problems/issues and he's been incredibly helpful.  You can get a good idea about how he works from his website.  He has tons of articles and videos that explain things and it's all free information.  He spent a long time working as an insurance company lawyer so he knows car accident and personal injury law from both sides.  I've also used him for estate planning and an employment issue.  He knows his stuff and has a sense of humor about it all so he's fun to work with too.  I definitely recommend him.< /Text>

< Review>
If you are injured in any kind of accident Robert Mansour should be the first person you call. I was in an accident October 2014 & was injured pretty substantially. He was a breath of fresh air in that whole horrible ordeal. I didnt have any medical insurance & my medical bills were piling up & wasnt sure I would be able to handle getting my bills taken care of on my own. A coworker who was involved in the same kind of car accident the previous year recommended him to me & that was the best move I ever made. He kept in constant contact with me, both him & Melissa were so amazing in putting my mind at ease & made me feel like I was in good hands. I never had to deal with anyone on the other side (insurance, kid at fault, etc). He set up my medical care (physical therapy, exams, etc). I was blessed to have him put a few doctors bills on lein to give me time to pay them. He did the best he could to keep my out of pocket expenses to a minimum. He was a great person to have in my corner. He was so completely honest with me, never made me feel like i was being "played" in any way. His honesty & good character is what made me glad to be a client of his. He has a great repore with alot of the doctors, physical therapists & insurance adjusters which not alot of lawyers seem to have. He makes you feel taken care of & he truly has your best interests at heart. I couldnt be happier with the outcome of my case. It finally has come to a close & he went above & beyond my expectations. I couldnt be happier & if you are in the market for a fighter, someone to be in your corner holding your hand every step of the way, Robert Mansour is your man. Good luck to everyone.< /Review>

I called to check oil change prices and was told I could bring in my own oil and filter and have it changed. I went out and bought the oil and filter and then Wheel Works said they "haven't used customer parts in years" and that they couldn't use my oil or filter to change the oil.< /review>

Wheel Works gets 5 stars for several reasons. First I called to alert that I received a flat tire from running over a screw (thanks to all the construction in downtown San Jose), and asked for reference for towing company. They directed me to Pineapple Towing which provided timely, inexpensive and impeccable service. Second, they fixed my flat tire within an hour or so which exceeded my expectations since they said it may not get done until following day. Lastly, although my car was ready to go that afternoon, I had work conflicts until 5pm, same time the shop closed. They waited for me after hours to come get my car. All with courteous and friendly service. I was very pleased with my experience and would go back to them in a heart beat. Thank you!< /Review>

Terrible customer service. First called to inform me that I was not allowed to wait on my vehicle, despite having that option available online. Fine. Then called again stating that they gave away my appointment and I would need to reschedule. Both this location and the Kiely location are terrible. DO NOT RECCOMEND<//review>

<review>Went in for a simple flat. They put the tire on backwards. Now George wants me to make an appointment to keep the car for at least 3 hours for them to flip it. No consideration for people’s time.< /review><rate>1< /rate><time>1582494600524<//time>< name>

<text>Woke up and found that my front driver side tire was completely flat and there was a nail in the front driver side tire . I called AAA to get them to put air in my tire so I could drive here to get it patched up. Arrived to the location a few minutes before they opened, 8:58am. I explained to them that the tire was completely flat earlier that day and there was nail, they said it was no longer there but they would check out the tire. They gave me an estimate of 60-90 minutes for the repair. I decided to leave and come back. After two hours still no call saying my car was ready, so I called to ask and they said all my tires where ok. I re explained again what tire it was and that there was no way all the tires were okay because my tire was completely flat earlier that day. The guy tells me they will recheck the tire and give me a call in 30 minutes. An hour goes by and no call and I just decided to get dropped off at the location and check on my car. When I get there I see the guys checking the wrong tire. First and last time I will go here. I’m still just waiting for my car over 3 hours later.< /text><Rating>1</Rating>< name>

<Text>Would give zero stars if I could. They seem congenitally incapable of keeping their word. 10:00 a.m. appointment turned into 3 hours for installation of 4 tires that were in stock. And the manager thought I was being unreasonable. Unbelievable. They promised an hour and a half delivery time and then wanted an additional 45 minutes. No nitrogen available either. Pick someplace else.<//Text>< Pics>

Very disappointed, this is my second time buying new tires here this year (and my last)..takes 4 hours to get new tires even WITH an appointment. People working at front counter ( Margaret) seems care less about customers waiting for too long👎👎all worker seems to work in a very slow paced.

<Text>Dramatic. I changed the oil filter: 3 weeks later, the new filter broke (!) and spilled oil all over my parking lot during the week-end (Sunday night and Monday morning). Obviously, I went to a different garage to get my oil filter replaced (why trusting this garage to get their mess fixed?...). I went back to complain, and the manager refused to reimburse labor and part due to another recommendation of changing a part, and she said she will contact the HQ. Resultat: DON'T EVER GO BACK THERE TO GET YOU CAR FIXED.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808fcb5d754b528f:0xa31059937f682805<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Ok so not sure how this place works but had appointment at 11am. Came in at 10:45am. It’s 1:10pm. Told them I have to be some were so if possible they can finish before 12:30 max 1pm since I’m in a rush or I can bring in the following day we’re I’m not in a rush and they said “SURE 2 hours is enough time ”. just came back from a long walk to find out they just putting my car on the rack. They said they need an hour to an hour and a half and now it’s 2.5 hours and still not done. I checked in and the response was I did not know you were waiting. Really? Don’t bring your car here unless you can spare 3 to 5 hours.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1556731049104, 'text': 'rithwan, we know your time is important, and we definitely want to look into this for you.

Went in for a leaking tire, I have AWD so I was dreading having to replace all 4. Will at the service desk was very nice, very helpful, and got the tire patched and taken care of in under an hour, even though I didn't have an appointment. Only $30, much better than the $800 i was expecting for a new set!< /text>

I would give 0 stars if I could. Called to see about an oil change. They told me to come in at 10:15am and my car would be ready within 2 hours. Finally around 1pm I headed back because I hadn't heard anything from them and my car was still sitting right where I left it... They hadn't even started on it. The kid at the counter had no idea what he was doing and when I asked for a manager I was informed that there wasn't one on site. I thought 2 hours was a long time to wait for an oil change with an appointment but apparently appointments mean nothing here because my car didn't even get touched<//Review>

I'd give zero stars if possible for this location. There was an unauthorized charge to my account that I did not do under someone else's name, except it was the same last name and address... just different first name. This was back in November 2016 and they still have not removed the fraud charge. Just give me the "run around" saying they will take care of it. Well, guess what? They never did. I spoke with the credit card company which instructed me that only the store was able to remove the charge as a "misapplied purchase" and credit my account. We have called them numerous times and they promise to remove the charge but never do. The person who had it charged to my account drives a Ford Focus. I don't even own a Ford Focus!! I'm so angry and tired of waiting on them to remove the charge. Heading there in person to get this resolved and I'm not leaving until it's removed!! Don't go here or use your Wheel Works credit card here. They are dishonest people.</text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>This tire rack is unusually good. I consistently get honest and fair service that I can trust. I have multiple cars, and so appreciate having a place I can trust nearby. For example, they use a torque wrench on the wheel lugs rather than just using the air hammer.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

You cannot rely on what they tell you.
I called and asked if they could repair a flat tire within 2 hours. The guy I was talking with said yes bring your car. I was there within 8 minutes, but I was told they couldn't do it! Very rude and no apology!</review>

Had 2 front tires put on my old car. The next day I noticed high pitched oscillating screeching. Commonly associated with brake pads that have worn down to the indicator. And the oscillation indicating that the rotors are warped. I took the car back in politely explained the symptoms that I was experiencing. And right off the bat Will the manager started accusing me of accusing him of causing damage to my car. I promise this was not the case. I suspect that my pads are worn down I just wanted to know for sure. I have pads and rotors I have been sitting on for a while waiting to install. So if it turns out that the brake pads were worn. It would not have been a surprise to me nor would it have been a problem for me to replace them both myself. I can tell you that my brake rotors we're not warped prior to the tire install. Because I had already planned on replacing my pads and rotors myself it would not have been a huge deal if they warped my rotors. The reason for the one star rating is because when I asked will to just let me know what was going on with the brake inspection and to please make sure that the lug nuts are properly torque. He got super defensive and standoffish telling me that everything is hand torqued and started to become quite intense. I decided to ask for my keys back and stated that I will be taking my car and leaving. I feel that his conduct was unprofessional. And after reading some reviews here this place seems to have a history of not assuming responsibility.

I also want to add that Will was trying to feed me bull crap by saying that rotors do not Warp. I called The Bureau of Automotive Repair services you verify his bold statement. It turns out rotors can Warp. And one of the main contributing factors is improper torquing of the lug nuts. So my first and last experience at this location was being lied to and accused of being that guy. I was nothing but nice and polite prior to wills episode. I advise using Firestone over Works. They run a tighter ship there. And less mistakes are made.

I forgot to add as insignificant as it is. Will offered me a $10 discount on a set of tires. Which at the time I was grateful for. When it came time for check out I was overcharged $10. Which I did not notice until I got to the parking lot. After I noticed the overcharge I was instructed to call back when will was on the clock. And that he could take care of it. At the time I assumed it was an honest mistake. But after my recent experience I now find myself wondering. It's sad that it is so hard to find honest reputable work in this area.

*update. After some research it turns out that rotors cannot warp. They experience lateral run-out. Which is caused by buildup of rust between the Hub and the rotor or by improper torquing of the lug nuts leading to uneven wear. And since my rotors were not removed there should be no variation between the mating surface of the Hub and the rotor. Which only leaves improper torquing of the lug nuts. Which brings me back to my point. I brought the car in because I suspected that the wheel was improperly torqued.

This is not the kind of experience anybody should have to expect When taking their car to a "professional" shop although technically rotors do not Warp as I found out it is a common shorthand phrase to describe lateral run-out. I feel that instead of arguing semantics will should have just offered to take a look and report back the findings as well as making sure the lug nuts wet properly torque to spec.< /text>

Wheel Works on The Alameda is my go-to place for oil changes and tire issues.  I find a newspaper coupon, drop my car off, and wait at the nearby Starbucks.  They're always friendly and fast, and I don't feel like they're trying to screw me over with additional things I need fixed on my car.< /text>

< Review>
They're consistently are lazy and dishonest at this particular location.  Which is why I drive across town to either the Kiely or the Prospect location who have great service and are honest.
This location lied about replacing my tire that was full of nails and under warranty....they left all the nails I'm and just reinflated it and told me it was ready to go! Luckily I took a closer look and I was pretty pissed.  And it wasn't a mistake.  They admitted to not actually changing it because they thought it was "ok" still and it had over half a dozen nails still in it!!! (Some truck spilled them on the freeway ~_~).  They decided not to change my tire AND decided to lie to me about it.  Because they wanted to hurry up and finish early for the night.
I made them replace it and I was pissed.  The time before that they tried to lie to my wife and say she needed new brakes....when I had already done them myself and they had over 70% life left. And were wearing evenly.  NEVER trust the shady guys at this location!!!!!!! Take the extra time to goto their Kiely or Prospect locations!!!!<//Review>

I had the extreme good fortune to meet Rory today. I am getting ready to move out of state and needed a nearby location to store things while we pack and have some minor work done to the interior of our home. Rory was extremely helpful in showing me a couple of different sized units that fit my needs. He helped me get all of my paperwork set up and gave me some helpful recommendations on help with moving larger items and other services that I'll need over the next few months. The location is super clean and very well maintained. He also took the time to show me how to access the unit and explained the hours. He is extremely friendly and really made me feel like my stuff will be in good hands and very safe under his watch!<//text>

My husband and I have had multiple storage units over the past few years and Mini U storage has the best costumer service by far! The owners are great and are always around if you need them, we will definitely be recommending them to friends in the future! Our unit was also very clean and we love how secure the property is!

I was in need of finding a small unit to store some household items. I reserved a unit online with a facility close to my house. The office was closed due to covid and after a week of trying to call and email I was never contacted. The day came when I needed to move my items so I decided to drive to this location to see if they could help. I’m so glad I did. Even while using covid precautions they were able to meet my needs quickly and efficiently. Very nice staff as well<//text>

Me and my boyfriend came here to rent out a storage. And had received the best customer service from Rory. He took his time to show us around, explain to us the paperwork, and made sure we understood everything. I definitely recommend coming here, it is a very clean, gated, and safe area to store your stuff! This is a very trusted company, we feel very safe to leave our belongings here. Thank you again Rory for the best experience!<//Text>

<Review>We've been with this place for years, and have always been happy with them! Rory & Sandy have given us nothing but top notch service from the beginning, and are very personable!

They always keep a close eye on who comes in and out, and don't allow any BS on the property. I feel it's one of the safer storage locations in the area!< /Review>< Date>

Rory at Vacaville Mini U Storage is a very informative professional who offers excellent service.  A great price for a safe storage unit offering perks for Veterans and Active Service members. I highly recommend Vacaville Mini U Storage.<//review>

I needed a storage unit for moving and downsizing. Meeting Rory and Sandra was a blessing. They worked with me and helped me through the process. I can't express how grateful I am to have met them.< /Review>

We went to a few other places in Fairifeld and decided to drive out to Vacaville and we are glad we did.

If your undecided on where to rent a storage space it doesnt hurt to come out and get a quote. You will not be disappointed.< /Text>< Resp>

I LOVE this place.  Rory and Sandy are great folks, and they really helped me in my time of need.  It is close to where I live, CLEAN, and to cap it off, I got a free truck rental with my first month's rental space, which saved me a lot of money.  I also like that their prices are way better than any of the other storage units I have rented.  They are genuinely nice, honest and care about their customers.  I would give them two snaps and a twist and recommend them to anyone!!</review>

Without a doubt one of the best customer service experiences I have had in years.   When I called at 9:00 am, I got a prompt answer without the phone ringing and ringing.   I got a lady who took my info, and within 5 minutes, Rory called to make an appt.   I have to tell you, both Rory and Sandy went above and beyond to explain their facility, and there was no doubt in my mind that I was in good hands.   The facility is very clean, and these two people show pride in their facility.  A true pleasure to do business with them both.   We really felt like family.   You can't go wrong doing business here.    And the price is competitive as well.   What more could one ask for?< /text>

They made this move in so easy.  Needed a storage unit last minute and they made it quick and painless.  Very friendly as well, they wave every time you drive through.  Area is kept clean and secure, also they don't allow any food in units to cut down on pests.  I would recommend them to anyone.< /Review>

I was even more happy to see that the the property is kept clean and seen that Rory and his wife really work together to keep the place nice. I like that they tell you all the little things you should know before renting a unit  from them so that there will be no surprises later.

The on-site managers were incredibly helpful and had amazing knowledge and tips to pass on to us during a stressful time. They offer shelving, packaging items, locks, even the use of a truck.
Easy access, right up the street in town. 24/7 security. And the best managers EVER!
Ask about specials and deals, there is usually something going that will benefit you.

I went to this facility because of the price, but I am staying because of the customer service.<//text>

<review>Great little spot to pick up and go. Fast service. The people working there are always giving it their 100 and I can say that because I see it every day info pick up either some breakfast or lunch since I do work close by. Everything is fresh. Never even seen a fly in there. Super clean.< /review>< Pictures>

Excellent work. Very professional and nice guys too. They arrived early and took great care wrapping my heavy items in blankets and saran wrap. Upon arrival, they used creative thinking to fit my items where they had to go, which was not simple. Took great care to make sure they didn't scratch my floors or walls. I would use them again Ina heartbeat. Hire these guys!< /Review>

Would use them over and over again. I highly recommend if you are moving that you use Fast and Easy moving Company. You definitely will not be disappointed!!!!!!!

These guys are simply the BEST. This is the second time I have hired them and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use any other moving company in the future. I manage a French Restaurant in Central LA and needed to move the entirety of our business. I was happy to be greeted by two trucks to help expedite everything and employees that are concerned with the care of all items as well as speed. Their pricing is beyond fair and as opposed to other moving companies I have worked with in the past these guys work fast to help keep the overall cost down for me.</Review>

Showed up on time, and wasted no time getting the job done. It went faster than expected! They were also super kind and went over the top helping my husband and I move. I will definitely be using them again and will recommend to all I know. Thank you for taking care of us!</review>< pictures>

Einars and his team were awesome! They were very professional, friendly and efficient. I was especially impressed with their problem solving abilities and their tenacity - they were hired to move a soundproof meeting pod that is oversized and heavy (approx 1000lbs). Every roadblock encountered was easily resolved, and the pod was removed and delivered with no issues. I love their teamwork and can-do attitude - I would highly recommend anyone moving to use their service!< /review>

The last time I moved was from LA to Little Armenia three years ago, and I did not have a good experience with that moving company. This time, I spoke to friends who suggested Fast & Easy Moving because they were professional, gave the best quote, and got the job done quickly.

I am so happy that I followed my friends’ advice because Einars was amazing! When he says “everything is included,” it is not a joke! I have a rather large wardrobe, and they packed it in seconds. My things were taken care of in the transition from one home to another, and I felt a huge wave of relief as he was working.

If you’re like me and working in the industry, you don’t have time to do all of this yourself, and if you find the time, you are probably exhausted from your long working hours. Treat yourself to a move that happens so fast, you’ll blink and be in your new home. I promise!

Happy moving, and thank you, again, Einars!</Text>

<review>I can highly recommend Fast & Easy Moving. The team was very reliable, friendly, on time, fast and brought all needed tools to protect our furniture. I've heard so many bad stories about moving companies and that people had to pay for so many additional things afterwards. Fast & Moving makes it super easy and transparent – You pay an hourly flat rate and that's it.<//review>< pics>

We used this service to pick up some furniture from our office. They were easy to communicate with, came on time and finished the job quickly and efficiently. Very easy to work with and definitely on my list to reach out to for moving services in the future.</Text>

<text>A great experience! Einard and team is the best. Very professional, respectful and courteous with my elderly mother who was moving, and so good with communicating times and details even throughout the move. They moved everything so carefully, left the storage unit clean, and not a scratch on any walls or a single broken item. We were so pleased with the service and will definitely recommend Fast and Easy Moving for anyone who asks. Thank you again!< /text>< pictures>

Awesome service, awesome people. Very professional at what they do and how they approach every move. A piece of furniture “not fitting” isn’t in their vocabulary. They lifted and wedged my new couch through my balcony to make sure the job got done. A+< /Text>

They’re fast, efficient, fair rates, accommodating — simply put, just competent. Isn’t this what you want for your precious belongings? I was apprehensive in hiring someone to move my items from LA to Austin, and I am so grateful that I found Fast and Easy moving. Einars was incredibly accommodating when I had to change my date and arrived promptly when I was ready to schedule and survey the job. I had fun chatting with him as well... he’s incredibly intelligent, personable and funny. He made me feel secure in sending my items with him across the country. I’ll update with more when I’m moved into my place in Austin, Texas!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The movers were amazing and so kind! They were very timely and super sweet for the whole move. They helped me pack up everything and move it to my new location. Extremely professional and great people! Will definitely use them next time I need to move :)< /Review>

<review>I had a great experience with the team at Fast and Easy Moving. They were quick, efficient, and took good care of my items. I was most concerned with moving some of our more fragile and expensive items and they handled them with care and ensured everything was delivered in great condition. This was the first time I used a moving service and I highly recommend fast and easy moving and can’t imagine moving on my own in the future.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
This company is a 10/10!! They went above and beyond and were working hard in 80 degree weather to get us in our new place as fast as possible. I'm very particular about how people handle my belongings as I have expensive furniture and they really took my concerns to heart when they wrapped every piece and communicated to each other my requests. They don't slack and do the best they can in the time given...they dont try to scan you for any extra time. I would use this company again any day and am recommending them to all my friends and family. Thank you!</Review>

Fast & Easy moving surpassed my expectations. Arrived right on time, worked efficiently and effectively. We moved from Los Angeles to Berkeley, and their team made it a seamless move! Very professional, and well priced. 10/10 would work with them again, please don’t hesitate to hire them!<//review>

I can highly recommend Fast & Easy Moving. The team was very reliable, friendly, on time, fast and brought all needed tools to protect our furniture. I've heard so many bad stories about moving companies and that people had to pay for so many additional things afterwards. Fast & Moving makes it super easy and transparent – You pay an hourly flat rate and that's it.<//text>

<Text>Fantastic all-inclusive service at a great price point! They came early, prepared well and executed the job with great precision.

I had a difficult job of moving a 400 pound treadmill from an old gym into my condominium, which involved going through very tight spaces and corners. My thought was that they would only be responsible for moving the treadmill, which was a difficult enough job as is. However, when he said this was an all-inclusive service, he really meant it. Einer and his partner literally took apart the treadmill and the associated electronics outside of my unit, brought the whole thing into my unit, and then re-assembled the whole treadmill again - piece by piece.

Overall their attention to detail and prompt service was impressive. They did all of this with masks on. I would not hesitate to use them again for any moving job.

A+ service. And all with a great attitude. I had quite the job and the 3-man team that helped me out did everything with the best attitudes and did everything efficiently and quickly. Made a stressful situation for me very easy and relaxing. Would 100% use them again and highly recommend them to anyone who has a move job. They disassembled and reassembled my furniture, packed up some small things I didn’t get around to packing up yet, my very expensive tv was delivered with the utmost care, they treated my items with great care. Just an all around great experience.</Text>

I was planning to move my stuff to Texas by myself, but glad I didn't! I hired Fast and Easy Moving, and Einars was in and out in less than 30 minutes. The service was right on time and professional. To top it off, I received a ridiculously good rate for a move to Texas compared to all of the other quotes I received. 5 stars!!!<//Text>

Einares was great. Kept in touch prior, announced his ETA,  was punctual and boom!, he went into action.
Moved me from Long Beach to Bakersfield. Crew boxed up our smaller boxes for efficiency and disassembled mu queen electric bed & moved my piano. Got to Bakersfield  and the house (and impressively without getting lost) and set about unloading, reassembling and boom!, gone. I can’t thank Einares and crew for making my retirement and relocation easier.
I’d recommend Fast and Easy to anyone. Oh, my daughter Eryn says Hi!</review>

<text>They did an excellent job helping move a fridge for me. So much so that when it wouldnt got through the door they were able to take down the door to make room and put it back up afterwards. They're hell was greatly appreciated because we couldn't do it ourselves and they charged the lowest hourly out of anyone I could find. They were extremely easy to book as well. I would highly reccomend then to anyone looking to move anything from even one item to their entire home.</text>< Pics>

<review>The best movers I have ever used and I’ve moved a lot! I couldn’t be happier with the service I recieved. For the owner of the company to
Come out and assist me on an extremely short notice same day move... they were fast, no
Hidden fees and so so so nice. I will use them for every other move I have ( which hopefully won’t be for some time)

You will not at all regret using this company for your moving needs. The best experience I had. My initial mover was unprofessional and cancelled on me and fast and easy was able to quickly get my booked and showed up within the hour! Words can’t express my gratitude for their help as I would be in a horrible
Position without them.

Einars was great! He and another guy, Alex, were some of the most focused, efficient guys I've seen. Seriously, they're pros. Fast and reliable. They showed up right on time, got our stuff moved, and were super reasonable on pricing. They also helped pack up the rest of our apartment, and it was a lot 😅</Text>

The team did great work! They were efficient in wrapped all items needed and made sure to alert me of any broken or damage furniture before transporting it.  Not sure how two men can move a whole apartment so fast, but they wasted no time. I loved the professionalism and also care for my items. They really did seem sweet and very genuine in their work.

I moved from L.A. to Palm Springs.  I didn’t have an excessive amount of items to move, but I was quoted $2400 for door to door service from another company, which didn’t include packing (I prefer to pack myself).  Einard and Pavel arrived early and brought everything, including boxes I didn’t need. They wrapped everything and handled delicate stuff with kid gloves. They hustled and gave me door to door service charged by the hour.  All said and done, it was four times less than the other place, $600 total. On top of it all, they were really friendly guys. I actually feel badly that I gave only $100 for them to split as a tip. I should have given them $100 apiece.  I would recommend Fast and Easy to anyone!< /Text>

This Moving company is the best!!! It was fast and easy move for sure! My family was moving from big 3000sqft to much smaller size house. We were very stressed out and worried but movers Einars, Oleg and Valery was very professional! Everything worked out better than we could have ever asked. I highly recommend this moving company for your next move. They are not just movers. They take great care of your stuff, also give you emotional support and make some jokes to make it easy. Definitely go with Fast and Easy!!!<//review>

Hired this company a week ago for 3 bedroom apartment move from Westwood to West Hollywood. 3 guys showed up on time packed and prepared all furniture loaded in truck unloaded at the new place. Nice team not a  scratch. All furniture was placed neatly as we asked. They using pro blankets and equipment. All including price. Thanks Oleg Einars and Vlad.</Review>

Fast and Easy Moving is the way to go if you're relocating in Los Angeles!

I sent out a request for movers and they were one of two companies to respond with reasonable accommodations and pricing. I was won over because of their locality. Einars and Vavo were prompt and ready to help us with whatever we needed. I was very pleased with the amount of wardrobe boxes provided, along with their response to any special requests I had.

Einars is a great businessman with one hell of a personality. It only made the move more enjoyable to have such good energy around. Vavo was a wonderful accomplice as well!

If you're looking to move in the L.A. area, please give these guys a try. They won't let you down and will be hard to beat in terms of efficiency, friendliness and a good experience all around.</review>

<Date>1622313198605<//Date><Rating>4</Rating><text>I placed an order online to pick up some sushi and a seaweed salad. The order was being completed as I walked in and was handed to me over right away - excellent timing!

I found my Philly roll to be fresh and delicious. The seaweed salad was mixed with what appeared to be cucumber, but delicious nevertheless. I somehow forgot the name of the second roll, but it was good as well. The only recommendation I would have for the restaurant is to provide a bit more wasabi and soy sauce packets.

Will be back!< /text>< Pics>

<text>Friendly atmosphere.  Great food choices.

I had the bento box with three items and it was a lot of food.

Tempura was crisp, the ratio of meat for the tonkatsu was perfect, loved the salad...

Get there early for lunch, it gets packed.< /text><user_name>Ken Kondo<//user_name>< gmapID>

<text>During the 2020 Covid19 virus pandemic, this restaurant has definitely not fared well in the keeping social distancing a thing. I pick up deliveries from here and have often been put into uncomfortable situations with customers and their staff because of how small the lobby is for their establishment. Just recently I was working and picking up a order a gigantic white man walked into the tiny lobby while I was picking up a order where the lady didn't properly give me space to get the order without her being in my own 6 ft space. I asked the gentleman to place step outside so as I could feel safe to get the food and leave the establishment without having to risk contact. To which he replied someone else won't be so nice but I better ask more sweeter or someone else won't be so nice. Which that meant to him threatening me and not moving actually then moving closer towards me while staring at the employees to which they stared on with no care for how a delivery driver being paid to help their establishment be threatened by a customer for politely asking for social distancing during a difficult and trying time for everyone. Will not be supporting this restaurant any longer.</text>< pictures>

This is my husband and I’s favorite sushi restaurant in Santa Rosa. Their fish is really fresh and the staff is always very nice. This is our special “date night” location that we are always very excited to go to as a special treat.< /Review>

I just returned from a wonderfully delicious lunch at Aji. Christine the owner greeted me warmly as did all of the staff whom I interacted with. My roll was so fresh and scrumptious. This is the first time I've ever been able to finish my roll on my own and it wasn't because it was too small. It was the perfect amount. I just had to pace myself and I felt perfectly sated when finished.
Treat yourself to a great meal at recently opened Aji Sushi and Grill, where Boathouse Sushi had been for several years. I am already looking forward to my next visit!
I was so famished when that beautiful roll with fresh cran and tempura shrimp was placed in front of me that I didn't take the time to photograph it, next time I definitely will, a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good quality sushi & grill with amazing staff who are professionals and polite then this is the place for you !<//review>

Food was good, but service was extremely slow and disorganized.  Took over an hour to get our order out of the kitchen.  Understaffed for a Saturday night.< /review>

Food was good, but service was extremely slow and disorganized.  Took over an hour to get our order out of the kitchen.  Understaffed for a Saturday night.<//Review>

I know good sushi, it's the main food prepared by extended family.  This place while new is great.  Good service, a little expensive, but you get what you pay for.< /review>

They did a tune up put in the incorrect plugs, and wired it wrong causing the engine to miss fire and messed with the cars electrical system. My car is now at Ford and they are trying to fix what this place caused. Save yourself the money and headache and go to a dealership. Especially when the issues they cause can lead to your car not lasting past 100000 miles.

Update: if a Brian calls you when you ask for a refund because they mess with your car, he will be rude  Good luck, 👍🏻 and just contact corporate.<//review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Overall I’ve had a good experience and nothing but good vibes in this place OZZY is great always proper when I call in and always very friendly when I bring my vehicle in. Today I went in and Joseph the manager was in not OZZY and I was very disappointed because Joseph (the manager) had this sense of entitlement and was very rude. Joseph lacks common courtesy skills and tries to over charge you for things you don’t need like literally I just changed a part days ago and now it needs to be replaced. This needs to stop! Joseph please lead by example if you’re going to wear a managers shirt. Overall great service when Joseph isn’t present.

Once again I came right when they opened and I was 3rd in line then 2 more cars came after me Joseph helped them before me. While OZZY was giving me great service customer Joseph walked in and started telling OZZY that I came last and to not help me. I told him look Joseph you already skipped me twice and I just didn’t say anything then Joseph tried to argue with me. Joseph needs social skills and better customer service. Joseph needs to go somewhere where he can learn social skills or work alone away from people that obviously put food on his table. If Joseph front desk I just come back a different day but when OZZY works everyone leaves happy. Jiffy lube please filter out people like Joseph and keep the good employees employed.< /text>< Pics>

I will never use this place again. I went in just to get a oil change. Got a oil change and a new air filter. The next day my son took it back in because the check engine like came on. Supposedly they did not put the air filter in properly. They said they fixed it. My son needed to use my car for family emergency.  My car has never leaked oil. I told my son to take it in to see why its leaking. Could not take it back in to jiffy lube because he was out of. Town with my car. He took my car into Valvoline  and they said the gasket was not the right gasket and that's why it was leaking. Had to get another oil change to fix it. I use my adapter to check codes on the computer in my car now it said Master Flow Sensor is acting up so my son cleaned it. still check engine light is on. I bought a new Master Flow Sensor and put it in my car. Now i have more codes popping up. I took my car into chevy to find out whats going on. They found the problem. Jiffy lube did not put the air filter in properly so the filter was bouncing around and making codes popping up. Chevy put in a new filter because the other one was damaged from bouncing around. So now i have forked 70.00 for a nother oil changed to stop the leak. 149.00 for a new Master Flow Sensor. 188.00 for chevy to find what the problem was and a new air filter. I called jiffy lube to talk to the manger i told him i will be coming over after i picked up my car from chevy. When i got there he was gone. He new i was coming over. 400.00 to fix there mistake. I will be filling a small claim against this company.< /text>

No extra service charges. Sometime mistakes get made. We are human. It's all about how a business handles these kind of situations. I would definitely continue to give them my business.

<Review>I was very dissapointed with this place.  I received an email from Jiffy Lube back in March that they have "Stay in your Car" Service due to the Covid-19.  I even called the Jiffy Lube (at this particular place Sanderson and Devonshire) and asked if that was still a service they had available, and they responded yes.  I went ahead and went to the Jiffy Lube and asked them were to pull up and the technician ( middle eastern with green eyes named Khasam I believe) asked me to get out of my car because their policy does not allow people in the car.  I was ready to leave when another technician called to him and said to allow me to stay.  So I went ahead an stayed in my car while they did my oil change.  Thankfully all technicians had masks and were friendly.  The reason of my visit was to avoid contact with other people and not allow anyone in my car due to any potential germ contamination.  So after they were done with the service the same technician Khasam asked me to get out of my car  to clear my maintenance light. I wish he would have just asked me to do it myself and not enter my car.  I was pretty upset because it defeats the 6 feet of distancing guidelines, allows his germs in my car, and I don't feel safe as a customer. I carry a bottle of Lysol so I Lysol my seat and steering wheel right after he got off.  After the service was done they asked me to pay inside, so I did. When I went inside, I had a mask on, but the customers inside did not have masks on, and when I paid with my card the counter and debit card machine was not cleaned.  Even after I paid the technician Khasam, he did not disinfect the counter or debit machine after I left.  So people out there be careful with this particular Jiffy Lube, on the corner of Sanderson & Devonshire, the service is quick when you are in the car, but it is not clean, they don't disinfect, and they are not holding customers accountable of distancing and masks.  If they would have allowed me to stay in my car the entire, pay, and made sure to disinfect their stations I would have given them 5 stars.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Thorough check of lights, fluids, and tire pressure. The usual offer to do more than the oil change, but not a real hard push. Overall,  a good experience,  but they could use another technician. Only one on duty, Friday afternoon.<//Text>

<Text>Brought my Miata here today for an oil change and spent 100$ for a synthetic service. Needless to say, it's the biggest waste of money and the worst experience I've ever had with vehicle service in terms of them taking care of my car. They over serviced my engine by a full quart, which has now over pressurized out of the engine and onto my driveway, probably blowing a seal or two along the way. Not to mention the entire splash  pan of the car is now covered in oil from a sloppy fill, which is now dripping all over my driveway. They're good at taking a clean, leak free car and turning it into something reminiscent of a 40 year old, leaky junk heap sitting in your driveway. Never again will I ever choose this company.</Text>< pics>

<Text>MY PURPOSE IS TO GET READY FOR A LONG TRIP THE FOLLOWING MORNING .
THE GENTLEMAN (RANDOMLY APPEARED)AND WHEN I STARTED ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS OF SERVICES (AT THE BEGINNING BEING IN LINE AT 5 P.M.)  I WAS DENIED EVERYTHING I SAID.
NO TRADITIONAL OIL CHANGE FOR MY 2004 SATURN VUE USING A $21.99 COUPON. HE INSISTED AT LEAST TO GET THE SYNTHETIC OIL- BLEND FOR 69.99. AND I SAID: "I DON'T WANT IT".
BEING DISORIENTED AND SADDENED,  I WAS SHOCKED AND I LEFT HIS PROPERTY.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I LOST THE CHANCE FOR MY BIG REWARDS OFFER USING MY BANK CARD (EXPIRING TODAY).
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ACCEPTABLE.
THEY ARE KIND OF COLD (LACKING OF COMPASSION) BEING FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS (AT THE SAME TIME). IT SEEMS THEY ARE UNHAPPY INDIVIDUALS.< /Text><time>1467426551707< /time>< Gmap_id>

THIS PLACE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO LISTEN. I pulled up asked how long of a wait. HERB told me 40 mins and I said ok, he said pull it up and I did. As I got out of my car I told the guy I gave my keys to that I had just changes my engine and cabin air filters and not to check them because I just changed them last week. He said okay I'll let them know. 20 mins later HERB comes in with both filters and I said, I had told you guys I didn't want/need my air filters checked I just replaced them past week and that there's is a screw that was stipped and now it got messed up because you checked the filter I told you not to check. And then also they checked my cabin air filter located behind my glove box and HERB disconnected the retractable arm and left it like that..  that helps hold the glove box and he told me that that is how it's supposed to be done. Wich is not how toyota had it. Overall horrible experience I had originally came here because toyota overfilled my oil resulting In a failed smog so I'm still trying to get a good oil change due to HERB denying me service do to me being upset because they didn't listen. horrible I won't even have my girl come to this one all because of HERB.</Text>

<user>107058588632485609979<//user><username>jules lash</username><Resp>None</Resp><review>Favorite buffet now. Actually, the ONLY buffet we frequent now. Their hot and sour soup is unbeatable, and you can add vinegar and green onion, to taste. I am so happy with that option. Honestly, I come here for the soup, but the variety of seafood and other meats is excellent and I always leave way too stuffed. But satisfied. 😋 They also have a hibachi grill. Wish the sushi was better though, but even that doesn't take away a star.< /review>< pictures>

At about $25 for all you can eat, don’t expect your fellow patrons to be classy or polite. One family of six, swarmed the crab legs as soon as they came out. Multiple times. Leaving nothing for anyone else. Wow, just wow.

Dinner here was good. I enjoyed almost everything Golden Koi had to offer. Most of the food was full of flavor and not watered down. There’s sushi, Mongolian BBQ, Korean BBQ, various Chinese dishes and then a pizza, huh? Nothing stood out as horrible so that’s a good sign.

The staff is very friendly and attentive. They do work hard to keep this place clean.

It is a bit messy at certain stations but you can blame that on your fellow patrons.

I’d eat here again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Golden Koi did a great job of accommodating protocols during Covid. Everyone had to wear gloves when serving themselves.  I normally do not like going to buffets because the thought of people eating and kicking their fingers and going back for seconds and touching the serving spoon with locked fingers is a disgusting thought.  But because everyone had to use gloves to serve themselves,  this thought was diminished. The food was good and being a seafood eater, there were plenty of selections to choose from. I think the dessert table could have had more variety but I cant complain about the main dishes. I ate on a weekend and I'm not sure if the menu is the same for weekdays but I was definitely pleased with the selection. I would have given it 5 stars since they weren't lacking, but like I said I'm not an avid buffet goer so 4 is the most I would give for any buffet. Definitely worth the drive to head out to roseville. Wish they had one like this in Elk Grove.<//review>

I’m surprised it is rated poorly by some! The workers are always friendly, the food is tasty, what more can you ask for? I took mine to go, as it was Saturday night and the place was at capacity with an hour wait. People know they are back open and are there in droves. When retrieving food, you have to wear plastic gloves. Overall I would recommend!< /text>

Went with 2 adults and 2 children but my 12 year old was considered an adult. Paid $90 dollars and couldn't even eat the crab it literally tasted like plastic or rubber!!! Even the feeling of the crab meat felt plastic. Never going again. Do not recommend.<//Text>

Very happy this place has stepped up their game from the past. Very good food and varieties! A little pricey but all you can eat people! There are no other places around like this.</review>

UPDATE!  The Koi Buffet is now open again! It's all the same great food as before. I just can't see the negative reviews here, cause service is great and the place is clean. The food is all fresh if you get here at a reasonable time. Best time is when they open! Fresh food and nobody has picked over all the food yet!  I gotta go back for those wings and ribs!

Closed for now due to the virus thing, but I really can't wait till it opens again! This is the best buffet in the area for a reasonable price. It's under new management so it cleaner than before and the service is perfect. The food is a generous selection of Chinese foods that you don't normally see at most buffets.

What I really like are the fried chicken wings and the ribs! Yeah Chinese do the best Chicken and Ribs! They even have french fries here, just in case you don't want Chinese food. I've always found the food hot and fresh, but do go 1/2 hr before closing and expect all fresh food just for you, it won't happen. Go at opening 11am! I want this place to open again!</text>

So finally been to a place where we wear gloves and grab our own food. It was a little to pack in the food area and no 3 or 6 ft distancing. Food was good.</Text>

Crab legs were soft and mushy. It’s still ok buffet but definitely not worth the $18.99 dinner price. Very disappointed 🙁</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We were so excited to try this place since it was the first buffet we'd been to since the lockdown.  Unfortunately was disappointed greatly.  I was most excited for the crab legs but there was none. The container was empty except for a couple little broken pieces.  Super sad since that was the main reason for going. My stomach was not feeling very well afterwards either.< /text>

Went for the second time the other day I mainly go to buffets for the crab legs lol but I was a bit disappointed AGAIN because the snow crab legs seemed a bit old and had no flavor like they've been sitting in plain water all day.. my advice would be just STEAM the crab legs to warm them not soak them.. I Will go back and try again for a third time but if things haven't improved I will lower my rating because I am a crab Critic lol. I'll update y'all I believe in 3 chances after that you're canceled if no improvement 😒< /review>

Food was good. Steady stream of customers for the lunch crowd. Temperatures taken when entering. Everyone wears a mask when not eating, hand sanitizer and disposable gloves worn while getting your food. We'll go again.< /Text>

<review>Cons: When getting food, people don't social distance but everyone has masks and gloves on unless seated.

Otherwise, I loved it. Oysters weren't great but the Cocktail Shrimp made it a great date.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><username>Madison Moulton<//username>< GmapID>

Have not been here for a year. So glad I came. Though it is more expensive now, the food and cleanliness was EXCELLENT! The food was very fresh and there were new selections. Glad I came early as it got crowded at lunch time.<//text>

< Review>
Pretty happy decision to eat there. Looked at the food before deciding and about 8/10 things looked pretty fresh. This was on a Thursday evening so maybe not the most busy time. At least not very busy when we were there. I imagine weekends to be busier.

This place is pretty big. Could seat many people if needed. Food was good and I think it's cool they have soft serve and regular ice cream.

Mostly pretty typical Asian buffet stuff with a few surprises. The Mei Fun was nice! Thin little rice noodles with a simple and warm flavor.

I might come back if I'm in the area and looking for a buffet again. Sushi wasn't great here but most non sushi buffets that offer it generally meet a low expectation for that.

Solid 4 stars. Service was friendly too! Maybe even more so than most buffets. I'll give them credit there.

5 stars if the sushi were better and more of the food items were fresh. But the price is quite good for what you're getting.

Maybe it's tough for buffets to compete at this price range though because Thunder Valley does a buffet that is bigger and about the same price for dinner on weekdays. Between the two, I'd have to give it to thunder but for the sake of variety I'd probably come here from time to time if I frequented this area a lot more.<//Review>

<response>None</response><Review>There's a good variety of foods and the restaurant is clean.  The buffet area, dining area and bathroom are clean, and that's each of the handfull of times I've been there. I appreciate that during this Covid time, they are requesting guests sanitize their hands and then put on one-time use disposal gloves each time they go get a new plate of food. The sanitizer and gloves are provided. It's a reasonably priced buffet that offers Chinese food and then some American foods for the pickier eaters (which include a small variety of french fries, cheese pizza, fried chicken, mac n cheese, etc.). They also have good customer service.< /Review>< GmapID>

Celebrated our 22nd Anniversarry excited our  favorite buffet was open. We had to dine outside which was okay on a warm day. Food was dry, cold, and limited with no sushi, Mongolian, fresh fruit, or ice cream. They did have many protocols to stay safe with covid to include wearing gloves and mask and eating outside.We loved this place before covid and hope they can make it thru these tough times,but sadly not worth high price with half the buffet options available 😢< /text>

Just your typical Asian buffet. They have seafood and regular Chinese food a dessert area fresh fruit area. They have a grill station but the cook kept burning everything. They had sushi which was okay. The main thing I disliked was that they used canned tuna in some sushi rolls<//review>

New ownership and food and bathrooms much much much better.  Overall really good.  My daughter and I only bothered to come in because we were driving by and saw the new ownership sign.  Glad we did.  We'll definitely be coming back.  Sushi was actually very good (and cold) for a Chinese buffet.  Mongolian stir fry and grilled shrimp were excellent.  Many other quality options as well in the Chinese buffet selection.  So happy to have a quality Chinese buffet again in the neighborhood!<//text>

Love coming to this to all you can eat buffet. Great food and best of all lots and lots of crabs to eat. I want to thank the manager Francis for his hospitality and care for his customers, he made sure I got the best crabs first after they ran out! Definitely recommend this place. Also very family friendly.</text>

<Text>The experience was great. Our server was on it with refilling our drinks and taking the empty plates away. The sushi was fresh and the tuna melts in your mouth. I also had bbq mackerel that was cooked in front of you and steamed king crab legs that was tender and sweet. Everything I tried was super tasty. Dinner was around $16 a person but truly worth it.< /Text>< pics>

Crab was awful, Chinese doughnuts were stale and had hard spots, and in my opinion the worst crime is the vanilla diarrhea they call ice cream.
Side note our waiter was actually creepy.<//review>

The new ownership has some decent items to choose from and run this place decently compared to the former hyenas that ran this restaurant. I would give this place three and a half Stars. Not bad and for the price it's pretty decent.

My advice is to get in before the quality starts to go downhill. With places like this usually new ownership tries to do their best but when they start to realize they're losing money it all goes to hell.</text>< pics>

<rate>1</rate><review>I don't think I can say anything good about this place...im not a person to usually complain about service but this place was bad. There was zero service for the 2 hours that we were there. To start it off they tried to seat us at a spot that had about a cup full of rice and noodles spilled all over the floor under the seats of one side of the table. We had to ask them to clean up our spot a few times until they actually did anything about it. We didn't get any drink refills(not even water) or plates cleaned off the table the whole time. By the time we were leaving we had plates piled up quite high andthere was little room for anything else on the table. The food was nothing special at all, so unless you are going to only eat crabs you might as well go somewhere else, cause that was the only food they had that was tasty.< /review>< pics>

<review>For an all you can eat place the food was very pleasing. One of the few we found with crab legs and oysters. The staff was very friendly and service was that of a fine restaurant. Plenty of food variety for pleasing children and adults, the only critical remarks I can say was that the dinner only signs were a bit confusing. I'm sure had I asked I could have cleared up that confusion. I can say the experience was overall pleasant and the restaurant was clean, well kept, and we'll managed. Thank you Koi.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>First thing you see is a nasty fish tank. The place was also hot and humid. Some of the food tastes  old.  The floors were sticky.  The cups weren't cleaned.

This place could use some help. For now I'll rate them a 1 due to the simple fact that I see no changing in the near future. These are the kind of people who will get by with what they can.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I was invited by my daughter and grandsons to dinner at this place...it was appx.8pm...to say the least we will never go back.. they are very racist there,and stood over our table like they wanted to know everything that we were eating...Several guys working there didn't speak a lick of English ,and the manager,made them watch us,and she made sure they didn't say a word to us..it almost seems like a bunch of puppets walking around at her command...there was a old van outside..that made me feel like something wasn't right with the guys that were there...They seriously acted like they had never seen black families dine out,it was very uncomfortable,when my daughter asked about the price change,an older man said something to a older woman ,and she locked the front door...lol..it's a nice clean place,but the people's that running it is extremely rude and never people friendly...I'll pass on this place never to return...< /Text>< user>

<text>Hands down favorite buffet in the area!! So delicious, nothing tastes like it's been sitting under the heat lamps forever like at other places. Great service, employees are super nice and helpful. Also, compared to other buffet place prices, this place is priced pretty cheap for the high quality of food you're getting. Absolutely love it, and higly recommend to everybody!<//text>< Response>

<Review>We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch there today. My husband & I are only visiting for a month from Fiji & we depart tomorrow.  Out of the 4 Asian buffets we visited here in California, I am highly recommending Golden Koi Buffet. The restaurant is clean, the varieties of food are so good & the customer service is superb. I ate alot of the mussels on the shell that was spicy & also loved the shrimps that were deep fried. The new manager, Francis, was so welcoming & checked every now & then to see if we were okay. The service boys, were quick to clear our used plates & were also quick to refill our drinks. Will definitely revisit Golden Koi when we are next here in California<//Review></record>

Good Chinese buffet with good selection.  Price has gone up some especially weekend nights.  Lunch is the best value.  Don't expect gourmet but look around there will be some good dishes.  If they are doing the Mongolian grill have that.  Don't judge this place on the nuggets and french fries that not what you come here for</Text>

Place was ran down. Prices listed are not accurate. Customer service was very slow and was hard to understand wait staff and hostess. Steamed oysters were not fresh and tasted like sand and dirt. When I brought it to the hostess attention she went and yelled at wait staff in front of everyone for the slow service but, did nothing to help them or try to improve the evening. They are getting one star because my boyfriend was happy they had crab legs and they had a decent amount of meat in them. However, both of us had upset stomachs after even though didn't eat much and date night was kind of ruined.</review>

Crab Legs were a bit bland even with the butter.... I enjoyed to Mongolian bit though, kept going back for more... Servers are a bit rude and don't refill drinks often at all. Oddly enough I'd probably still be willing to go back.<//Text>

<Text>Best seafood buffet around. Salt and pepper shrimp, coconut or Walnut shrimp, crab legs, lots of times they have called mussels too. And that's not even 1/3 of the fish selection! They also have decent sushi (although it's not the best) and a grill, plus all the stuff you would expect at a Chinese buffet. The only downside is that the floors can sometimes be slick. I one-time went in wearing a special boot from my doctor's office... Had never had any problem with it anywhere else but it just didn't have enough grip on the slightly slippery floor
I ended up leaving halfway through my meal because I was seriously afraid of falling.</Text><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

<Review>It's great for buffet, take out makes it less affordable since it's by the pound and you don't get sushi for the take out. But the sushi is very simple and there is a chef on standby to cook your food like a bbq style ! Quick service and nice ladies. Clean bathrooms!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

It was okay there is a lot to choose from sushi bar crab legs Mongolia bbq type stir fry bar. But the melted butter for the crab legs tasted like plastic the crab was cold and wet like it sat in the pot it was cooked in all day. But it was worth the 12.00 i recommend there ribs they are awesome<//review>

We had celebration yesterday.
Costumer service must be improved!
Four our friends left , because of unprofessional customer service..
They included tips in to the bill..!
I can tip only if I see service. We didn’t see that..

Buffets!!! What can I say, most buffets are the same but if you manage to go right when they open is the best time to go.

Small buffets dont have enough people coming in at open so they dont make enough food then you find yourself waiting for things.

Not here, at ooen at least be smart when you go to a buffet, Golden Kois good is great to taste, fair priced, and they're always stocked, bot running low like some other chinese buffets. Maybe that's why they're one of only a few left around here?

From best potstickers I ever had ( because it tasted like they were partially deep fried) to their deep fries shrimp what else can i ask for?

Trust me theres more, just go!!!</text>

<text>The buffet selections are extensive including many Chinese food favorites, soups, sushi,  and Mongolian grill.  Ambiance is up scale and spacious. Servers were attentive.  I enjoyed my $10 buffet lunch plus drinks, and would do it again. I'm a little surprised the weekday lunch crowd was rather light.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Great variety from sushi to sea food to stake and chicken. BUT... it needs more cleaning. The entrance has crumbs all over the floor, under the table floor was disgusting also. I had to tell the server to sweep the floor for us. The two ladies in the front had their own thing going instead of making their area look good. Your lobby is your presentation, right?. If that is right at front, Can you guys imagine how dirty is the back where we don't get to see?? Uhh goosebumps...<//Text>

The front desk lady seems doesn't care about being polite. The food ... the food didn't look fresh and tasty. Some of the sushi looked real old. The lunch is inexpensive. And that's plus.</Review>< pictures>

Food was good. But the area where the food is was so crowded. A lot of bumping in to each other. And the restaurant wasn't even that full. The food area is definitely not in proportion with the size of the restaurant. Food was worth it though.</review>

<text>Food started out great when first opened. Quality and service has declined. We gave it a second chance, but they just couldn't get it right. Food was not fresh, and seemed to be a little worse the second time around. I had hoped it was timing, but friends and family have had the same experience. Please save your money for a better restaurant/buffet.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have been to this buffet before and considered it to be one of the best. This time was different. Most of my usual favorites were there but they were not hot. Everything on the buffet line was barely warm. It was all still quite tasty, but disappointing based on previous visits. I'll give them another try whenever I'm in the area again.<//text>< resp>

<Review>We went with our friends and kids a couple of days ago, and we had the worst experience ever. After two hours of eating there we all felt horible. We all were vomiting . The food is not fresh at all. You will make a very bad decision going there. Worst food ever... this kind of restaurants must be closed forever, people are in danger eating there...</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

All food is greasy or oily. Staff is nice and tends to everyone in a timely manner. Prices are a tad high. Good selection of food for everyone.<//Text>

<Text>I have been to this buffet before and considered it to be one of the best. This time was different. Most of my usual favorites were there but they were not hot. Everything on the buffet line was barely warm. It was all still quite tasty, but disappointing based on previous visits. I'll give them another try whenever I'm in the area again.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Food was not good. Flies. Employees kids running around, like 5 or 6. Dirty tables. Employee was having lunch at the table next to us, slurping a bowl of gross stuff. Windows looked like they were cleaned with a stick of butter. Waited a long time for dishes to be picked up. We should have walked out. This place was great a few years ago.

We love this place! Lots of foods to choose from. Sushi and lots of cooked foods and deserts too. Only waited a short time for seat once on a holiday, and usually get right in. Can do a carryout here too.</Text>

I am not sure why the others are saying the food isn't fresh and delicious.  It is every visit for me.  It must be the day and time of day I usually go (Sunday, about 1pm).  Everything is fresh and hot.  They couldn't restock crabs 🦀 fast enough. I enjoyed just about everything I normally would order at Chinese restaurants. I don't get food poisoning from eating there.

Three things I don't care for there: salad bar, sushi, and the grill to order meat. 1) Chinese food isn't about salad, it's about cook veggies. Don't eat that raw greens at buffet. 2) sushi is Japanese food. Chinese are notoriously bad at making sushi. If you ever had bad sushi, chances are the owner of that place is Chinese or Vietnamese.  3) I watch those guys grill...not sure what it is but they manage to burn the meat all the time. Plus they don't change tongs between raw and cooked meat. That's just asking for trouble. Avoid these 3 and you'll have a more enjoyable experience.

I dock a star for crappy service, as it is expected of Asian restaurants to have crappy service.</text>

<Text>One of the worst experiences ever the food look like it been out forever and cooked in old oil the pepper steak had no pepper no flavor it was like eating wet meat! The food was barely warm!  My wife and I could not even finish one plate! When we complained and asked for a discount we received a senior citizen discount which we could’ve got anyway so that was laughable!

<GmapID>0x809b21ee172bf235:0x1c377604113065c2< /GmapID><review>If I could give them zero Stars I would. My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday and our 10th anniversary. We went during the dinner rush and the food was horrible. Everything was either cold or overdone the sushi looked like it had been left out in the sun all brown and wrinkly. The fresh meat for the grill looked at least a month old some of it was indistinguishable. The hot and sour soup was anything but hot and sour more like slippery and slimy. The vegetables in the salad bar were wilted and not very fresh at all. The desserts were dry with no flavor. The ice cream came out of the machine like liquid. I didn't want to pay but I learned watching Judge Judy that if you eat the steak you have to pay for it and if you don't like it don't have to go back again and you couldn't give them a review that shows how I feel. I would not even sneak food out for my dog. So heed my warning it's not worth the money or the stomach ache I'm sure to have later.<//review>< Pictures>

This Chinese buffet is glorious. Glorious. So much of so many kinds of food. So much food. Also I'll just say, they've often got pricey stuff in the buffet: crab legs, fish, shrimp, beef, Mongolian bar b que.
Fried foods.
Kid friendly foods (a whole line up of the kind of stuff kids who don't like Chinese food would like: fries, chicken nuggets, desserts, salad, etc). And two dozen more things. Classic American Chinese food: chow mein, been and broccoli, fried rice, General Tso's, orange chicken, etc etc. Also Soups. Crab Rangoon, egg rolls, pot stickers, teriyaki skewers. I truly cannot remember everything, just what I've tried.
Bring $12-15 and feast<//Text>

<Text>Way over priced horrible food. They honestly shouldn't be allowed to serve what they were giving us. Plus the tall server's that works their attempted to help us when our daughter spilt her drink, he went and got a rag wiped up maybe half of the split soda, laughed at my daughter, and walked away. Don't WASTE your money !!!!!!! I'm actually feeling kinda sick righting this.</Text>< pics>

Rude front desk staff/supervisor/owner. Plates still wet. Food is not good for $16 price. We are  not done eating and they started cleaning with the smell of bleach. If you guys will accept guests last minute before you close, dont make us feel like you are rushing us.</text>

The food was just ok. The service was TERRIBLE. The manager is extremely rude. We had called about prices before we went in. When we got our bill we were charged more then what we were told over the phone. When we asked about it the woman was extremely rude about. On top of that it was freezing inside! Customers were eating in their coats. The staff was walking around in winter coats. When we mentioned it they just looked at us and walked away !!!! Absolutely terrible service.<//Text>

<review>We came here when the place first opened for the day. The sushi was not the prettiest but we still got it thinking maybe it'll still be okay. It was probably the best thing we had but nothing special. I got a steamed oyster and shrimp, neither was clean on top of that both were bland. The rest of the food we got wasn't even heated to the right temps it was all luke warm. I 100% wouldn't take my friends or family here again.</review>< date>

I normally do not like buffets very much due to lack of variety. Golden koi though has it down right there's just enough of everything to keep you interested. Staff is alert. Food is great and there is a wide variety.</text>

<text>The food was tasteless the crab legs were soggy it was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted. Even the pot stickers were overcooked hot and sour soup was rancid tasting.

The entire 2 hours we had not one person come up and ask us for a refill.  And worst of all they didn't bother cleaning our plates off of the table. Second,  the lunch service food is absolutely disgusting. Tasteless and a waste of money. I think the only thing I ate there a d enjoyed it was the wonton soup. My kids didn't bother eating their pizza, French fried, chicken nuggets, doughnuts,  not even their fruit. I mean just terrible. Never coming here again. Not worth the time or money. There are plenty if other buffets in worse r off areas that are much better.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Great choices and very nice dining room. Many of the buffet food labels we're missing and that's why 4 stars< /text>

Food is decent but the facility is neglected. There hasn’t been a toilet seat on the toilet in the men’s bathroom for a couple of visits. Had to ask to use the women’s bathroom for my 3 year old. The soap dispenser is also off the wall so no soap to wash hands. What do the employees do? Disgusting. Won’t be coming back here.< /review>

Very nicely furnished inside the restaurant. Food looks great, but not fresh. I got two salmon sushi and had to spit them out. Tasted like day old sushi. Most of the food are not good even the order to grill meat.
The only okay food were split shrimp with cheese on top, order to grill shrimp, the ice-cream, the fruits. Everything else are horrible. My friends tried the oysters and they said they were okay, but I didn't dare to try.

The only redeeming value is the nice decorations and the place is huge, a lot of space. Price is good. I think it was $15.99 AYCE on July 4th. So that's probably dinner price.</review>

The food has been going down in quality for some time.  Lunch buffet does not serve Eel, Tuna, or Salmon sushi anymore.  Some food is palatable, but most of the items during lunch is poor quality.< /review>

I like the food,  for some reason though,  the back of the restaurant is incredibly,  uncomfortably cold.   I'd give them a 5 if it wasn't for the temperature issue.</text>

< Review>
terrible customer service and food is barely edible, seemed left over from day before, one person in our party got violently sick from the grilled meat. they would not honor our 1/2 off on the 2nd dinner because the others in our party got the senior discount even though we got separate checks. not deserving of even one star but you have give star to be posted<//Review>

Just yesterday my family had lunch at Golden Koi Buffet. This was the first and last time we visited this place. We didn't find any outstanding food in comparison to other buffets, but service turned out to be much worse. For more than an hour while we were eating our lunch nobody even tried to offer a refill or pick up durty plates from our table. We had to make a tower of dirty plates and left-overs in the middle of table. It seemed like they have forgotten about us or just ignored. We didn't even receive our meal ticket at the end, so strongly decided not to leave any tip for such shoddy service. But voila ... 10% tip (or as they call it service charge) was already included to our bill. Any attempts to get it waved were unsuccesfull. SO, KEEP IN MIND BEFORE YOU GO TO Golden Koi THAT YOU'LL BE CHARGED 10% MANDATORY TIP WHETHER OR NOT YOU RECEIVE ANY SERVICE.< /text>

<Text>Food is terrible... not warm, over cooked. Sushi is bad quality. The staff always changes. I used to be a fan of this place. Not anymore. Nice neighborhood, nice bulding and plaza. The temperature of the air is either too cold, or too hot. Currently hot. I would rather eat outside! 1 star for the building.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Absolutely HORRIBLE! I never write reviews unless they are pleasant, however I felt compelled to write this to warn others how disguting this place is & to help people save their money. I spent $31 bucks on garbage. The food tastes like its been sitting under those heat lamps all day. Huge health concern. The sushi/tuna was turning brown. The crab legs were filled with water and tasted like old fish...not crab! My sons chx nuggets were so hard he couldn't even bit into them. The dessert buffet is cookies they bought at wal mart, left them in the package & set out for people to grab....like really?? That's what I'm paying for? The wait staff is not friendly at all. Workers are playing on their phones behind the food counters, just ignoring you. I could go on and on and on....but I think you get the picture!!!!!< /text>

Waiter was almost completely non-attentive. Never removed a single plate. I placed all used plated on a nearby table. We also had to request refills. Definitely could use some  coaching.

The cooks refilling the buffet were significantly more friendly and kept me updated on the ETA of what I was looking for.
They even looked me in the eyes as I was talking to them. I don't see a lot of that anymore.

I was going to give only a 2/5 star rating, but the cooks by themselves earned, and deserve, the third star.

- UPDATE -

Dropped to a 1/5 star. Prices are NOT posted. Adult dinner buffet is $16. Two children in our party, same age, charged different prices. Tip is added to the ticket. Our waiter didn't earn at time of anysize. I just had to wave him down to remove a stack of 4 plates. Total ticket for 2 adults, 2 children, and 2 softdrinks, and aadded tip... $51.04.

We will not be returning.< /Review>

Super disappointed. Food was not as good as before.  And then they wouldn't honor a free birthday dinner for my son because we didn't have his birth certificate. REALLY, who carries a birth certificate with them and he's only 15, so he doesn't have a license yet. We had a party of 6 people, so needless to say we won't be back😣😣</Text>

<Text>Food is horrible, it's cold and you can tell it's been sitting there for a very long time! Worst service ever, couldn't even get water! Stood in line to have chicken cooked for me and 20 min later they got one of the bust boys to cook it. No one was there restocking the buffet trays so the food options were very low. Place is dirty! Will never go back!!< /Text>< pictures>

Bottom Line...the food is awful. I don't have high expectations for a Chinese buffet but this place sucks. There were a couple good things but for the $12 or $14 or whatever it is for lunch, it was a complete waste of my time and money.<//text>

The service was wonderful, the people were very friendly, and were definitely on top of things. As for the food, it's mostly seafood oriented, so if you can't eat seafood or don't generally enjoy it, the number of items is severely limited. If you are a seafood buff, it looks very appetizing and I was very excited to see whole cooked crawfish among their selections, not something you generally see west of the Mississippi. I was also happy to see the bean-paste filled items, something my family greatly enjoys when we go to any oriental themed restaurant.
The soft serve ice cream, though, was definitely refreshing, having a vanilla custard flavor that was very delicious as opposed to the run-of-the-mill watered down vanilla you can find standard in a lot of other oriental buffets.
I would've been a lot happier, though, if there had been more beef-based products, or dishes that didn't have fattier-ended meats. The General Tso's chicken is also VERY Americanized, very sweet with very little spicy and sour. My current take-out place wins over The Golden Koi.<//review>

< Review>
My 2 friends followed me in, they didnt eat because they had just finished eating greasy Mcdonalds. I told the staff it's only me eating and immediately they motioned their frail asian waitress to watch us like a hawk for the entire duration to make sure I did not pass a single rice grain or grape to my friends. No water refill. Napkins came right before they gave me the [charge fee ticket on the tray] to go pay. I ate at lunch time and it lasted to the crossover of dinner, they plastered many "Dinner only" signs above their newly switched better food trays to deter me from tasting it. Their bathroom is so dark to the point of it being spooky, you might start thinking about Freddy Kruger lurking in there. But really, the darkness is a slip hazard. The staff has no personality at all, they're all doing the mannequin challenge up until its time to take payments, then back to weird mode. Dessert section is horrible. 3pm Lunch time foods was obviously from 11am due to visible limp brown broccoli. I'm not talking about brown gravy all over it, Im saying the heat lamp destroyed greenness of the vegetables. Even the onions have wilted to fetal positions. Bendable  carrots. No crisp snap. Do not try their cheesecake, it tastes just like a flavorless styrofoam or a dish washing sponge (texture!)<//Review>

Food was terrible , my girlfriend didn't even eat it, she tried a salad, but that too wasn't good, how to you mess up salad? When we told the people who work there, they said to us oh well its always the same.. I think they may be right, re-heated food it tasted like.

Stay away from this place,  YUK!  We wasted 40 bucks that night.< /review>

Used to be the best Chinese food buffet in Sacramento, but they are now not worth the price. Service is really good that is the only reason I gave two stars. I will not be returning any time soon. JD< /Text>

<Review>Food is going downhill fast. Crab legs way too salty probably cause they were bad. Both my boyfriend and I got deathly sick afterwards. Service was horrible you'll die of thirst before you can ever get a refill on your water.

Entered for two.  We got a table that was half a$$ clean  right in front of us. Im looking at food smear on the table ask for another  one was told no. They ran out of plates  so i went back to my table which i cleaned to get my plate. Plates were bought out  the first two  i picked  up was dirty
Litrerally someones ate food from a  took fromn a table ran through a washer and bought back out for people to eat off of. (That how people get sick.) Most definitely wont be BACK .</Review>

<Text>The food is ok depending on what you select.  The dessert selection is not good the ice cream is never working good.  Golden Koi Buffet needs to step it up on cleanliness and fresher food.  But remember it is a buffet.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The food is very bad, shrimp any two or three days old, the appetizers are hard bread and gelatin. The whole rice was also hard as days. And now I don't even follow him ... I went by recommendation, but I'm not going to stop there again. 😖
