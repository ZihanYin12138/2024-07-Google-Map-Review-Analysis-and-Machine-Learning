<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Absolutely delicious, i was on the run so i only got the wrapped grape leaves and the Gyro sandwich. Both very delicious. But for sure next time I'll order a bigger meal for more to enjoy. The restaurant was clean and decorated so quaint, the people were so kind and respectful, and the smell from the cooking was causing me to drool.💜🍽 Can't wait to come back!< /Text>< Pictures>

Soda was dirty. I asked the waitress to change it and she was not happy. The next drink was dirty too. I decided to eat my food without a drink! The saffron rice tasted like burned bread. And the supposedly lamb kabob was definitely not lamb. It was beef kabob. This is from almost a year ago. They may have other chefs. I have never been there since then and I'm not planning to, anytime soon.</review>

<review>We had this Togo. The chicken, flank steak , were tasty grilled goodness. Seasoned just right with quality meat. The ground beef consistent in flavor. Out of the three, the chicken and steak were the best. The basmati rice fluffy and nice. Served with grilled whole tomato and jalapeno. Bottom line, the food is simplistic in form and good. $$. As always  explore wherever  your travels take you...< /review>< pics>

Absolutely the worst food I've had in my life and I'm not even picky. How can you mess up a basic Persian rice let alone kababs. Nice job on the raw tomatoes too.< /Review>

Exceptionally great food, friendly service, and lovely food presentation! Impressed with new ownership and subtle changes that make it unique to Betty's. We're previous loyal patrons of George's but are certainly happy to have Betty in town. Fresh tasty hummus pairs well with an aromatic Perisan salad over thin bread. I enjoyed a hearty plate of lentil soup which I devoured as my main dish. Spouse ordered the combo plate with chicken and beef kabobs that he thoroughly enjoyed. Servings sizes are generous, bring your appetite, or even share with a friend. Our server was charming, efficient (water glasses ALWAYS filled), and had a nice sense of humor. We are big Fans of Betty's and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great meal in town!< /Text>

Just had my first visit here today. The owner was so welcoming and hospitable. Plenty of serving with the koobideh plate that I ordered; fit for two meals for me. The basmati rice was so sublime! I'm planning on giving them a phone call directly to place my take away order again very soon!</Text>

Welll, let me start off by saying I absolutely love quality, let me repeat, quality Persian food. I have traveled hours to go to the Bay or Sac to get something decent. We stumbled on this place looking for something that wasn't packed due to it being Valentine's day and all. Ok let me also mention I’m Middle Eastern myself and KNOW good quality ethnic food.
We called to see if they are open for dine in and the woman who answered the phone was so so pleasant. Very welcoming. So we get there, nice family owned restaurant. Very quaint. The beautiful Persian music was playing. We ordered our food and sat down to eat. I have no words to describe how happy I am to FINALLY have a GREAT Persian restaurant close enough to frequent regularly. The food was superb. The kubede kabab was amazing. My husband ordered the steak and chicken kabob combo. Holy smokes. I was blown away. We ordered two more dishes to go for dinner.  I want to try everything on the menu. Oh and how can I forget to mention the Baklava!!!! YUMMMM. I had to write this review quickly so people can spread the word. Lets support this amazing spot.</text>

My husband and I really love Mediterranean food and were really excited about trying out this restaurant.We tried it but were absolutely disappointed with the taste and quality.The food taste like it was cooked in old rancid oil.(Disgusting)This was the first and last for us.The End<//Review>

The food here is homemade and just delicious! Particularly if you are a little adventurous with your palate or if you are partial to Mediterranean food. We had a yogurt, herb and rice soup that was just great. Of course we had the lamb and chicken kebabs and the cabbage dolmas. The owner Betty is a doll. We will be back soon!!!< /review>

Earlier today I told my wife that I was craving Kabobs and I really wanted to feast but didn't want to spend a bunch of money at a sit down nor did I want to fire up the grill and go through that hassle of making kabobs. A couple weeks back we passed Betty's after church but I was in a rush to get home but the smell of the Kabobs were stuck in my head since then. I called them up today and a lovely lady picked up the phone and I ordered 2 koobideh dinner plates, a skewer of tomatos, 5 skewers of koobideh and 1 skewer of chicken breasts. Let me tell you they like to add roasted jalapenos on the side for free which was an awesome bonus. All of this for less than $60!!!!! I gave them $60 and an extra $10 as tip. This much food would be well over $100 anywhere else. The owners were extremely hospitable and accommodating. I told them I would be cutting it close to their closing time and they said no worries and they waited for me. I don't think I'll ever make Kabobs at home anymore. I'll be using Betty's from now on for all my events. This is a must go to for Keto meats.< /Text><gmap_id>0x809056c7cb8d6983:0x432875af1b9a0224<//gmap_id><Name>Eilo Betoushana< /Name>< Response>

Fantastic! A 10+. Food is cooked and prepared perfect! The staff, as sweet as can be. The chicken kabob, prefect, and the rice, yes please. The Baklava, save room to have a piece, and to bring some home. A must to visit. Betty is SO sweet!<//Review>

I'd add photos if the food had survived more than a few minutes haha. Overall the food we had was fantastic. Pita is great, gyro wraps are delicious and large for $7.99 (if you're getting your food to-go I'd get an extra taziki sauce), and the hummus appetizer is an amazing value. Delicious garlicy hummus with tons of pita bread to eat it with. Definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of Mediterranean food!</Text>

We had a great experience at Bettys Kabob today! The young waiter was very friendly and obviously wanted us to have a good experience there. The food was exceptional. They make everything from scratch I believe,  so it does take longer to fix than fast food,  but it was worth the wait. Go when you have time to relax and enjoy the experience. We definitely plan to return.<//text>

In my opinion Betty’s Kabob is the best Mediterranean restaurant in Modesto. The service is fantastic, the food is beyond great, and you never go away hungry. One word of warning: don’t order too many dishes; you will not finish everything
We started with Cabbage Dolma and Hummus and were full when our lunches arrived. Cynthia took home her Greek Salad, but I tried to eat the Chicken Kabob Sandwich. Everything was so delicious, but I ate way too much.
Oh, try the doogh. Fantastic!< /review>

Mediterranean food and the setting here is super good. Visited on Fri I believe. I look forward to a return trip. The prices are well within reason for the quality. I can see why they have so many good reviews.</review>

The staff is great and super-friendly. The burgers were very good, but the fries just I'm. If you can, have some of the lentil soup. It is the absolute best I ever tasted. We finished off with some baklava. Fresh and delicious all the way through!! We'll be back.<//text>

Portions are generous. Quite inexpensive for the amount and quality. Food is delicious! Came for gyros and kabob and they made it possible having both without having me order extra food on top of throwing in extra Gyros! Delicious! Will def be coming back!</review>

I got some food to go. food was not good. Ordered a chicken kabob with rice. Chicken had little to no flavor. The rice tasted really earthy and was not good. I had to throw it all away. Other places in town with similar food but way better.< /Review>

<text>The food is amazing, however the service is so bad that it kinda sucked the flavor out of the food. Me and my cousin went there to celebrate me getting a new job and it took over an hour for our food to get ready. We tried to ask for a refund and the cook lost her temper with us and dared to give us attitude! She was like well geeze thanksssss! What am I gonna do with all this food, and we said is been way over an hour. She said I am alone in the kitchen today. And we said that's why we were considerate but to a limit. How is that out fault? Then I told my cousin well if the food is ready we will just eat it because I don't want to waste food but she had it in to go boxes when were dinning in. We just took it to end the fight, but it really left us feeling bitter, unwanted, and a burden which is no way for a customer to feel. However the food was actually good I just wish we had a better experience.</text></record></dataset><record>

One of my favorite places in Modesto. Only gave it 4 stars because I'm used to a thicker and more robust tzazaki sauce & I don't think they salt their meat. The hummus is so good! Pita bread is so fresh. Really delicious affordable Mediterranean.</review>

The servers are very nice. We had the gyros, falafel and sliced beef kabobs. The rice had saffron which was very nice. The food was grilled very nicely. I would have liked some Mediterranean music in the background and perhaps shwarma on the menu. The falafel was wonderful and I will definitely be back for more yummy eats!<//text>

George's Burger have recently come under new ownership from what I can tell but are still serving up quality kababs. I never order anything else. The combination plate is wonderful.<//Text>

This is Betty’s Kabob now, not George’s Burger yet this page has combined the two.  Betty’s Kabob is delicious!!!  We have enjoyed the gyro sandwich, chicken barg, flap meat kabob, koobideh, and lentil soup.  Got to sample the new falafel recipe, too!  Mmm.  Great family, great service, and delicious food!!!!< /Review>

Giant burger.  Needs more sauce and a thinner cheese. Also helps to put fixing on top of the meat so the bottom of bun isn't mush in the 5 minutes it took me to get home also decent portion of fries but under cooked I'd rather waiting 3 more minutes and receive fries that are fully cooked. was a disappointment.< /Review>

The burgers rival.any of those from big chain stores. The other food available make you want to try them instead. So my son had the gyro's and I had the burger with some if the tastiest fry's (unsalted), for those if us with high blood pressure.<//Text>

Order at the counter, family-owned segment.  Great service.  Great prices.  The Pepperjack & Jalopeno burger had a perfectly grilled, quality patty.  Sitting in a freshly toasted bun with grilled, fresh jalopenos, cheese and tomatoes/lettuce/bbq sauce... plus a side of fries to boot.  A QUALITY burger.  Portions more than par for the segment.  Prices a little less than par.  A well earned 5-stars in this competitive segment.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

They were very welcoming and kind. They were able to work with me to get my dog in as soon as possible, and their prices CANNOT be beat. I drove down from the Sacramento area to have my dog seen and I don't regret it at all. These guys are great< /text>

I was very pleased with the way my cat, Charlotte, was taken care of her last days.  The vet and staff were very carrying and did all they could to keep her comfortable.<//Review>

They got us in on short notice and they took us through a side entrance into a private room so we didnt have to go through the waiting room. We had taken care of the arrangements over the phone so we literally just handed her a card and signed in the room. No mention of business or money or anything to detour from our last moments with our baby. The nurses and Dr. got down on the floor with us and talked to our sweet pooch so kindly and with so much love. All I can say is on a really really bad day this place brought us some comfort.</text>< Rate>

<text>Everyone there is wonderful. They are personable and they really care about the animals they treat. My personal favorites are the vet techs. I don't want to put their names online, for their privacy. They do a great job and try to give discounts if they can. Dr clay is very thorough, I have nothing to complain about. I give it 5 stars, they earned it.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I took my Conky here to have some blood work and he is going back for a dental soon. I have been in rescue for many years and seen several vets in my moves. The Dr here is knowledgeable and friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the care my dog recieved there. After our summer at Bear River cabin i will be driving from Antioch to bring my baby here.< /Text>

I woke up on a Saturday to my cat clearly in pain. I had just moved to Pine Grove and hadn't established a vet yet. I tried to call the vet an hour before they opened and someone answered! An hour early on a Saturday morning i was able to get him in right as they opened.  It was an emergency so i was expecting emergency prices for the visit.  My cat had an abscess that was early enough to just keep clean. They gave him all the shots he needed with the visit.  The vet and staff took care of my cat like he was their own. I was in and out for way less than i would have ever dreamed.  I had to make sure they were charging me for the emergency visit and routine shots he needed. This will be my vet for life! Thank you!</Text>

@Bob Molin and @Donna Cooksey. Since new ownership began in March 2018, neither you nor your pets have been seen at the clinic with any of our doctors. You are not in our system as active or current clients and these comments have been flagged for review as spam.< /Text>

<text>The vets are smart, patient, and kind, and the staff is top-notch and wonderful to work with. The services are comprehensive and affordable, including boarding. The whole thing is housed in a darling old yellow farmhouse on the main drag - very easy access. Pine Grove Veterinary Clinic is a community treasure!<//text>< userid>

It’s a shame there is a new vet there that doesn’t know what she is doing and some of the staff are very rude. If Dr. Clay was still there I would stay, but unfortunately I’m not going to be wasting my money on this lousy excuse of a “vet clinic”.

Update: I decided to go back since it was under a new owner. I’m glad I did. The staff is better. Dr crunk gives you excellent one on one and genuinely cares. I’d highly recommend this vet over any other vet I’ve been to.< /Review>

We remember your pet and you very well, and were concerned with gross neglect after you declined and refused treatment for your pet. You also declined allowing our clinic to take over care for your pet and find her a new home. Her condition was by no means a “joke” and we recommended her eye condition to be treated aggressively with surgery.

Oscar was really friendly, professional, and fast! I'm also very happy that I didn't have to leave the house (since it's a mobile service & they came to me). I would definitely recommend Perfect Vision!< /text>

<Review>My roof was hit by a rock while driving by an overpass and my sunroof completely cracked. There was no way for me to drive like this especially when it's rain season. Thankfully Oscar was able to find the right part (which was extremely difficult for me) and came quickly to get it done! If ever need quick, reliable service I highly suggest contacting this company!< /Review><Time>1578958025592< /Time>< name>

After getting quotes from several other places, we decided to go with the one that was recommended, Perfect Vision Auto. We had our replacement window the next day in less than an hr. We are very happy with the friendly and efficient service from Oscar and his crew. Would definitely recommend them and will be using them again if needed.< /review>

<text>Out of the dozens of windshields I've had replaced over the years NEVER has it been done as quick and efficiently as with these guys. OSCAR clearly proved his stated 15+ years of experience as he literally not only effortlessly replaced the Durangos glass but answered my questions and performed as if I wasn't hovering and ready to critique at the first chance.. well that chance never came! Highly recommend these guys as I will be using them til the end!< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1618342600744, 'text': 'Thank you for your business Robert'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Customer Service is outstanding. I had my windshield replaced the day after I made my call.
Oscar quoted me a very fair price, work was completed in about one hour (as promised) and went over instructions with me on the care of the car.
Oscar is a very professional, pleasant, friendly person. I highly recommend Perfect Vision Auto Glass.</review>

My morning started out bad after having a wood block for a yard project slam into my windshield on the way home from Home Depot. I contacted Oscar from a google search and was immediately impressed with his professionalism. He agreed to meet me that afternoon and showed up right on time! I watched the windshield replacement install from start to finish and was very impressed with his attention to detail all the while making casual conversation. He did an excellent job and I will definitely request his services again in the future if I’m ever in need. Extremely fair price too!< /text>

Absolute best at what they do! The whole experience with Perfect Vision Auto Glass was stellar! First off, they had the best prices. I've been postponing replacement of my windshield and been driving around with an ugly crack because when I got quotes from other places, the price was too high.
When we contacted Perfect Vision Auto Glass, I couldn't believe how nice their pricing was. Oscar was so kind, attentive, understanding and professional! He is just the sweetest guy! Dealing with him was such a pleasure. He let my 4 yr old son watch him replace the windshield (me little man really wanted to watch). He did a great job, very fast, great quality, super skilled and professional, and I'll repeat again, very nice and kind! I'm so glad we found them! Thank you again!!

After Safelite could not complete my job due to one of their policies, Oscar and Perfect Vision came out on a couple hours' notice to finish replacing my van's windshield. They were easy to communicate with and did a great job in a very timely fashion for less than I expected. Would recommend to anyone.< /Review>

Oscar was very professional,  he came out to my husband's work to fix our truck window. He was there and gone with no problems. He vacuumed all the glass out of our car and made it look great! We are very happy with his service and that within less then 24hours from calling we had a new window! We highly recommend him and for any other window repair we will be going through him.< /text>

< Review>
Oscar worked with me, around my schedule, and location, making it very convenient for me to get my windshield replaced. I’ve never had a windshield replaced so I was not sure what to expect. Oscar’s calm and confident demeanor put me at ease. He let me know what he would do and what his timeline was. He completed the repair in less time than quoted and provided me with follow up information about the repair, next steps and warranty information. My new windshield is perfect and I know that I will not have any problems due to the pride Oscar puts into his work. Thank you for making this experience so easy! Oscar will be our go to person, and he should be yours too< /Review>

Perfect Vision Auto Glass installed both for us. Great prices and friendly service. He was very professional and was able to get our windows fixed in a timely manner. I would recommend him 100%.

The staff was amazing. I called and got a quote. The price was reasonable and then some. Communication is also great. They told me it would take at least an hour and they were done before that time. They were great. Thank you so much. I feel so much better now that the wondow has been repaired.< /Review>

I needed an entire windshield replacement after a rock shattered and cracked my windshield. Perfect Vision Auto Glass worked with my insurance company to get the approval for the replacement.  The very same day Oscar came to my home and replaced my windshield right in my driveway! This company is fast, efficient, professional, and provided great service. I highly recommend them.</review>

Oscar fixed my windshield in 24 hours the same windshield a  large insurance recommended company took 3x trying to replace and 4 weeks to get it right and still the OEM windshield came scratched, I had to decline the windshield.  He worked quickly with my insurance company and within 24 hours of the final straw for me he was able to find the exact OEM windshield, install the windshield and calibrate it. He is knowledgable experienced and did a fantastic job, he was impressive to watch him do the job. The windshield looks and responds perfect!! He was on time and worked efficiently. I’m completely 100% satisfied with his work. I’d give him 10 stars I’d it was an option. Thank you again Oscar!!</Review>

Our community vehicles were vandalized on New Year's Eve, and Oscar was referred to us.  I called Oscar a couple days later, not only was he professional, yet timely. Oscar did exactly everything he stated he would provide, the window was replaced, all the glass was out the door and inside my vehicle.
It brought smiles back to my daughters as well as myself after being vandalized.
I recommend Oscar and his service to anyone, he's totally personal with his professionalism of his work, he takes great pride in providing services to the community.
Thank you, Oscar!< /Text>

<Review>I came outside today to find my windshield was pretty smashed--I freaked out, but not for long. I called Oscar, who was referred to me by a trusted friend, and he was here within 1.5 hours and completed the work quickly, professionally and did a great job!! Much below the other estimates I received-Thank You Oscar! Will recommend you to everyone I know :) Use Perfect Vision Auto Glass instead of the other places the insurance companies recommend, I promise you it will be will be the best decision you've made today. Support local small business! And he was almost $200 cheaper!! Excellent service, great guy!!! 10/10 will always recommend him.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

We were so bummed when a drunk guy punched out our back window of our newly purchased vehicle. Our insurance originally pointed us to Safelite , and we also looked at different shops around the Chico area and they were all charging 30-70 dollars more then the guy at perfect vision was charging . He came to our house in Chico all the way from Yuba City in the morning, and was done before we had to start work. We are very happy with the job and highly recommend!< /review>

<Review>Oscar is amazing and so professional. He was highly recommended from a family friend and I can see why. I contacted him and he was able to fit me in the next day, without any hesitation. He was able to come to my work and do it. And to top it off, he even vacuumed the inside of my car. Wasn’t expecting that at all and I really appreciate it!! Thank you again!!</Review>< pics>

<Review>He fit me in so quickly and had excellent customer service. He even vacuumed out my car where the window was he was replacing. Overall, exceeded any expectations I had and if i ever need another window done, he’s who I’ll go to.< /Review>< user>

I am so thankful I came across Oscar and Sal! They really saved me after a botched job from another individual. They didn’t have to go the extra mile as they did to make sure I was taken care of as they did. Not only was Oscar very profesional but he was very knowledgeable and compassionate after the mess the other person did. Thank you Oscar and Sal for saving me today and getting me back on the road safely. God bless you!</Review>

< review>
Dr Ariani has been my husband's cardiologist for the past 25 yrs. We have always felt he was so caring and took a personal interest in his patients as well as their families.  I have been so thankful for his willingness to take time with me and explain the different procedures that were necessary regarding my husband. Now that it was necessary for me to see Dr Ariani as a patient I had complete confidence in him and his staff. I  trust his advice and would recommend him highly.< /review>

I am writing this review on behalf of my father. My dad would recommend Dr. Ariani because his office is compassionate and knowledgeable. His staff is very professional and courteous, the office is super neat and clean. My dad couldn't be happier with his cardiologist.< /Review>

<Review>When I walked in, I was greeted by the young lady behind the glass shield. Without me saying anything, she noticed that I had the paperwork that they sent to me prior to my appointment and politely asked if she can have them. Then within minutes I was called inside. Another young medical assistant took me in and performed an EKG. Very polite and very respectful from the minute I walked in. Then the doctor came in and introduced himself and started asking questions and examined me. He seemed very knowledgeable and answered all my questions without trying to rush me out of the office.
He is on top of my list of recommendations to friends and family.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Dr. Ariani is an excellent doctor. To which I want to add that he always takes the time to relate to me as more than a patient, but as an individual who has personal needs that impact my health. I have known the doctor for many years, and even though I moved to another county I continue to see him two or three times a year. I highly recommend Dr. Ariani to any one looking for a an excellent doctor patient relationship.<//review>< rate>

Arrived early by mistake and they got me in no wait, what a great break, awesome. Office personnel are always generous, personal and good humored Dr Ariani can be personal and really present when not rushed and those visits always comfort my fears. In the days of great doctors over worked, it’s a solid office and a good experience, no time for hand holding, but those days are gone everywhere.</Review>

I had 2 fillings done today, and Dr. Winters and his assistant did a great job! I didn’t feel any pain whatsoever, he did a great job numbing me the right amount and he was very precise and efficient. I switched my son from a dinky kids dental to Dr.Scoot Winters and I completely am happy with this decision. His assistants do a really gentle and good job with the cleaning as well, and they are very personable.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Winters is hands down the best dentist I have experienced.  My autistic son had a VERY traumatic dental experience before we were referred to Dr Winters and he Dr Winters was so patient and kind to my son that he is no longer afraid at all to visit the dentist.  It’s no longer a anxiety ridden experience to have to take him to the dentist.  I was so happy with how well he handled my son that I ended up going to him myself.  Now he helps me and both my kids and I will always refer him to friends, especially with kids.  I think we have been loyally going to him for 3 years now and I wouldn’t go anywhere else.  Additionally, his staff is amazing, every single person I have come into contact with is so kind and helpful.  Customer service is a lost art and I will always give my business to a group that gives good customers service as well as care.< /review>< Pics>

My experience with Dr. Winter and his office and reception room and the treatment I received from him was excellent! He was so caring that I did not get a bit of pain, and I had 3 extractions. I want to report the goodness in his heart and his help to everyone I know.”</Review>< pictures>

I love how they schedule their patients for a dental visit they are really good with timing and really good with kids. I’m usually never there for more than an hour and they get the job done as professionals should. I highly recommend winter DDS! They’re awesome. P.s. (I never do reviews.)< /text>

I've had many Dentist and hygienist in my life. After returning from serving in the Army, it took me a while to find a "good" Dentist and staff. Dr. Winter, the hygienists, and front office staff are an A+. I did get lucky in striking gold with him. Very knowledgeable and each hygienist are excellent and fun to convo with. Very efficient and friendly. They provide early morning appointments so I don't have to miss work. My entire family are patients. Dr. Winter can also do wisdom teeth extractions which he has done for my sons. You will not be disappointed in having Dr. Winter and his staff as your life long Dentist.<//Text>

I love Dr Winter & his staff they are the best. Dr Winter & staff always make you feel good about going to the dentist. Dr Winter always makes you feel very comfortable while doing your exam or dental work. The front office, hygienists & his assistants are great. I highly recommend Dr Scott Winter.<//Review>

Every time we come in we are treated like family. The front desk gal Nikki is always smiling and friendly. It seems like every person that works there loves their job. My 9 year old son actually gets excited to go to the dentist. Overall so very happy and would recommend all ages to go there.</Review>

This is the most personable and professional dentist office.I only wish I had found them sooner.
They call you by name the moment you walk through the door. They are both patient and supportive.
The office staff Will get you in as quickly as possible
And most importantly if you were missing your smile they will help you find it</Text>

Mariette had a non eventful appointment yesterday thanks to Dr Winters and staff. Please see for yourself what friendly family professionals can do for any and all your dental needs.

Mariette saw Dr Winter for a followup today and once again she went on and on about how gentle and caring her appointment was today.  As with her prior visit all involved from the desk to the procedure room were instrumental in making a potentially traumatic experience into a smooth sailing voyage from start to finish

Today Mariette’s  visit was for Professional cleaning. Since joining Dr Winter’s service we have been completely satisfied with knowing our dental care is in full control and worth every penny spent.<//review>

I finally got my crown installed after a long delay due to the Covid 19 crisis. Dr. Winter and staff are taking extra precautions to make sure patients are not exposed to the virus by seeing only one patient at a time, which gave me some comfort. As always, they did a great job. My crown fits perfectly and looks great. Kudos to Dr. Winter and his wonderful, professional and  friendly staff!</review>

Winter and staff are fabulous!  Like most people, I was in need of a dentist because I had an issue I could no longer ignore.  A cracked tooth that resulted in a root canal.  I was nervous beyond belief.  To my surprise--and huge relief--I didn't feel a thing!  Dr. Winter and staff went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable from beginning to end!  Hats off to Dr. Winter and his staff!  If you're in need or searching for a great dentist, call Dr. Winter's office!

The visit was good.  The dental assistant was thorough and professional.
I was in the chair for less than an hour; had all my teeth cleaned, polished, and had fluoride added.< /review>

I have real sense that everyone working here loves what they’re doing. All are friendly and it immediately makes you relax and feel comfortable. I had fillings on my front teeth. They did a beautiful job. What a difference it’s made to my smile!< /review>

<Review>I had a fear of the dentist like many people and avoided going for years and my reluctance cost me dearly. I have been going to Dr Winter since he began his practice at this location. He and his excellent staff got me straightened out and now going to the dentist is no problem at all.  Dr Winter and his entire staff make going to the dentist as pleasant as it can possibly be.
Don’t put it off any longer. make an appointment today!!
Highly Recommend !!!<//Review><user>110791259315184717035<//user><user_name>Bigrig 66</user_name></record></dataset><record>

I have had a phobia of going to the dentist for years.  When I started going to Dr. Winters I was straight forward with him in telling him how much I had a fear of the dentist office.  Dr. Winters and his staff were very understanding and caring for my feeling.  They worked with me and made me feel comfortable.  I would recomend him to anyone that has a fear and needs the extra support in getting the proper care they need for their teeth.<//Text>

<review>My experience with Dr. Winters has been terrific, he is both skilled and knowledgeable in the field of dentistry. I have found he and his staff to be professional, kind and patient. His rates are fair and the staff follows through in taking care of billing my insurance in a timely manner, and invoice appropriately any balances not covered by insurance. It is important as a consumer to build a relationship of mutual trust and respect with health care providers. I feel that I have this with Dr. Winters and have been his patient for more than five years. The staff has respect for my time and in return I show up for appointments as scheduled. When there is an issue, I appreciate how Dr. Winters carefully goes over the results and clearly indicates the areas of concern on the X-ray. I appreciate this sort of detail and explanation during my exams.< /review>< Time>

<text>I have been a patient for over 30 years and have always received great care & service. At my last appointment I was surprised to learn afterwards  I was financially responsible for the cleaning as my insurance wouldn’t cover the service. I was never advised by the staff this appointment would not be covered and as long as I’ve been a patient I had ALWAYS been told beforehand of any procedure that would include an out of pocket cost to me, so I could make a decision on going forward or not. They dropped the ball this time.and I’m hoping it won’t happen again.</text>< rate>

<review>NO EMERGENCY CARE! Very unprofessional and have no empathy for their patients. Would not recommend this office at all. My mother had an emergency situation and after waiting all weekend we were told that if we couldn't get there in a half an hour there were no appointments for the whole WEEK! My mother was a patient there for many years and that meant nothing to them. Neither did her being in pain all weekend. They absolutely did not care!  We called another dental office and even though she was not there patient they squeezed her in and got her antibiotics.  She is now referred to an oral surgeon to drain the abscess since she had to wait so long. Not to mention she is 82 years old.  NO EMERGENCY CARE!!</review><Gmap_id>0x809056aaa5e02439:0x57622d6043e3866< /Gmap_id><response>None</response><rating>1</rating>< pics>

Professional staff and hygienists. I received extra procedure not  covered by my insurance, but was not charged. Doctor Winter was professional, low key friendly, (as in genuine), and straight forward in repair options for me. No hard sell.
I had been told by previous dentist, (a different business), that my son was in dire need of braces. I questioned this for good reasons and asked for specifics in writing. None provided.  After a thorough exam at Winter's, no braces or fillings needed.  Integrity is great.< /text>

<Text>First, you need to know, I have huge anxiety and fear of dentists, due to multiple traumatic experiences as a child.  I have been a patient here for about 10 years and I will not go anywhere else.  The staff is understanding, comforting, friendly, professional and excellent at what they do.  I had to go in for deep cleaning yesterday.  I was scared to death.  Their Conscious Sedation option not only gave me confidence to walk through the door, but I slept through the entire long procedure and have zero discomfort today.  Thank you Dr. Winter and your staff.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Dr. Winter is a fantastic dentist! You can tell that he cares by the way he explains the how and the why of each procedure.  I feel very confident in his abilities and appreciate the depth with which he is willing to answer my questions.  I believe him to be a highly trained dentist who I can trust to do a quality job every time.  Honesty is evident in his practice and that is huge to me.  Too many dentists perform uneccesary work in order to drive the bill up.  My kids absolutely love him and his staff.  They are all so inviting and friendly.  On the way home from her appointment last week my 6 year old daughter, without any prompting, said: "Daddy I love the dentist".  What else can I say.  I'm sold.<//Text>

When it came down to my care it was just about money.  They didn't really care about me or my pain.  I was treated poorly.<//Text>

I celebrated my nomination this evening in this great place. happy to tell that it was a cool evening and the venue was certainly the reason for that outstanding gathering. The waiters  collaborated in a splendid style, the food was very good and my buddies were so  cheerful. We shall surely come back again for more celebrations. thanks very much.</Review>

<Text>I was so displeased with my meal.  I ordered one all beef new york hot dog.  I was charged for 2 and received 2.  That would have been fine, but when I got home anxious to enjoy my meal, I was sorely disappointed.  My 2 hot dogs were old, the tomatoes were old and the pickles were old.  I couldn't even eat it.  I am a long time Der Wiener schnitzel diner, and I've never received anything like this from them.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I love this brand. Used to live in Sa Diego and went to one there all the time. I live in Boise and there isn't one there.  It would make a fortune if one was built there.<//review>

<UserId.>116716927159477458929</UserId.><text>This place is a gem. Eaten here frequently over like 20 years. Awesome, friendly staff first off. Second the hot dogs are better than Pink's. Get the chili dogs or ask for a straight up can of chilled chillin in a can for latter. Amazingly sinful ice cream such as chocolate dipped cones or cups drizzled with fudge or  sumptuous banana split. Don't try to avoid the fries, if driving through, you won't likely get home before finishing them. Get the mini corn dogs but the best is the Polish Sandwich, a hot dog in a rye bun with mustard, swiss and a pickle. Simple but brilliant.< /text>< rate>

<rating>1</rating><text>At the end of me and my family's day we decided to go to this Wienerschnitzel it took about 10 to 15 minutes before speaking to anyone once we got to speak to a employee they could not get our order correct but once we got to the window you can clearly see that two of the employees was high or drunk you can tell from their face and their mannerism once I receive my receipt I noticed I was charged for things that I did not ask for and they was not in our bags and when I requested my money back the two employees acted like they wanted to fight me</text>< pics>

It's ok. You have more selections than the average Wienerschnitzel but it's one of those occasional places I would go to if I was in the mood for a chilli dog. Not the next quality but affordable.</Text>

I have found that Wienerschnital tastes different from place to place. Southern California seems to be the best. Utah is the "not so good" place.<//review>

<Text>Love coming here for lunch! Food is bomb. I don’t know but for some reason the chili cheese fries come out looking real good every time. Gone to other locations, and they either don’t put enough chili or skim you on the fries. Real fast and convenient. Inexpensive. Staff is very welcoming as well. Sometimes however, it is a mission to pull out of the drive thru. So be very careful as you come out.<//Text><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Cashier guy is very rude! They definitely need to be secret shopped. Cashier guy looked like he was doing something sketchy in the back with the chief when making the food. At the end he didn’t even say thank you for stopping by or anything. He just handed me the bag and walked away. I didn’t even trust him with my food so I just trashed it and now I’m speaking to corporate about them. They need to learn how to speak to customers.< /review>< pictures>

<username>A B</username><Text>This place needs to close or have an entire staff - and especially manager - replacement. It's amazing that despite being located somewhere as nice as Santa Monica, this particular Wienerschnitzel location is the worst I've ever been to. The food here used to be the only thing going for this place but even that is gone now. The service here has been awful for YEARS. It'd been about a year since the last time I visited this location so I was hoping things would be better but they were worse. The problems with this place used to be horrible service because the staff was rude, often made orders inaccurately and would turn off the fryers long before closing. In addition to those problems, now the food is sickeningly cold and disgusting during midday hours. It wasn't busy, there was no line and there are no excuses. I couldn't even finish my food because it was so cold and inedible, I had to throw it away. I regret giving this place a chance and I suspect most people will too until drastic changes are made here.

(Last Year's Review: The food here is just as good as at any other Wienerschnitzel location but the staff is not. Even if no one is line, they’ll take a long time to get to you and take your order (almost as if they’re hoping you’ll just leave and they won’t have to do any work). When they take your order, they’re not very polite or professional; they sometimes have a hard time understanding English; they’re not very helpful with answering any questions about the menu; and they don’t even always have the courtesy of telling you what your total is and asking you to pull up to the window once your order is complete – then they have an attitude if you ask them if you should pull up or not. Sometimes the ordering process here can be very slow and frustrating. [Warning: They do not take American Express!] To make matters worse, the food here isn’t always done correctly – always make sure to check your food before leaving! Also, if you show up within the last hour before closing (from 11:00 PM – 12:00 AM), they will often tell you that some of their food is no longer available as they “already shut off those fryers/machines”, even though they’re not supposed to be closed yet.  Very disappointing and unprofessional.)</Text><resp>None< /resp></record>

The pastrami was cold and cheese wasn't melted on my fries.The Jalapeno poppers had an after taste. The strawberry pineapple lemonade was excellent.< /text>

Not bad really.
Worth upgrading to the all beef dog.
Outside seating and drive thru only.
Burgers and fries just okay but the Santa Fe covered fries surprisingly good (it might actually be New Mexico green Chile)</Review>

<review>Good hot dog. Fries were ok

The guy wouldn't let me inside to urinate during rush hour traffic. I really had to make a pee but the guy didn't seem to care. The guy showed absolutely no sense of empathy or care towards me during my state of vulnerability; which truly reflects how this corporation treats its loyal customers.

I ended up having to pee in my Weinerschnitzel cup.

Will not buy from again, will definitely never endorse their food to any of my large circle of friends or associates.< /review>< pictures>

The salesman was very rude!! I bought a candy shake with m&m, and he put 4!! 4!! But I’ve already bought candy shake there, and another man put me enough of it. But this guy started to ask me the money for extra! What?! I just asked a little more m&m. Im disappointed!</Text>

Took forever to order, asked for two things off my sandwhich including onions cause I’m mildly allergic and it’s just very annoying and slightly painful the rest of the day. I received my sandwhich with onions on it and I nicely asked for it to be remade the young kid said sure, then gave it back to me in 1/4th the time it took to make the original one. I asked if he made a whole new one, he said yes , I said thanks cause I’m allergic to onions and he nodded yes again. I opened up the sandwhich with the same old melted slice of cheese with a very cold second slice of cheese of top and no bbq sauce...I asked for a refund cause I was on my lunch break and now it’s way too late to wait for another, and the manager was verbally not happy about the request . I just got a job down the street and it sucks cause the deals are great but the fact that the employee lied after I said I had an allergy is Not okay and I will never go back or take anyone there. Not out of being a jerk, just so I don’t get an allergic reaction.</Review>

<Text>Went thru the drive thru. I ordered a combo that consisted of A hot dog, a chili burger and chili cheese fries. When asked to replace the hot dog for a extra burger or all-beef hotdog (No matter the price), I was told it was not possible even though I've done it plenty of times at other wienerschnitzel locations. The area in which the prepare the food looks very unclean and unsanitary.</Text>< Pics>

I love Wienerschitzel's chili most of all their chili cheese fries and I come here all the time when I'm in Santa Monica; but tonight might be the last time I go to this location. I went there with my daughter because she was hungry and she wanted chili cheese fries so we ordered two and the guy working the drive thru name Ramon took my order and totally messed it up. Cool not a big deal I know It happens so that's not why I'm complaining. I get half way home on the 405 freeway when my daughter realize that the order is wrong, they gave us something called blazing fries instead so I turn all the way back around just for a remake I get there to return the food just for what I had ordered and  the guy Ramon had a bad attitude making me feel like I was wrong for returning something he messed up on and then accussed me of lying saying that I ordered blazing fries instead of my actual order. He didnt provide me with a receipt so I dont know what I paid for and most of all I never been called a lier in a drive thru before and honestly it took a lot to keep my composure since my daughter was in the car with me. What shocks me is that he did not reframe from arguing he insisted and then was reluctant to give me the managers name and wouldn't provide me with Corporate information instead I had to find it online.</text>

I almost never take the time to give ratings, but this was literally the worst customer service ive ever had, and they deserved to have their rating knocked down.

McDonald's is right next door.< /text>

Giving this one star review because I'm here at 11:45pm and the guys inside said they are closed and have nothing left. Whatever that means. I really really hate unreliable hours!!! I drove here specifically because they were open.</text>

No complaints if you whip looks awesome. And no arguments with the deal, they hooked it up.

Fun fact: they finance so you won't be broke and able to go out in you good looking car.< /text>

Delay after delay to drop off my truck to get lowered. I get it back with a bumpy suspension , front bent license plate and missing ONE wheel cap. I was only missing one front one the first time I dropped off my car . When I get it back I’m missing two wheel caps after I specifically asked for the other one back it’s hilarious. Left my message on open too when I asked if he had found them and didn’t even bother to reply , nice job manny 👍<//Text>

<Review>I’ve never left a review about anyone or anywhere but this place just got to me. They have rims online at posted prices and shipping available. I made my selection and grand total was $515. I didn’t pay though, i thought i would head over to the store the next day to do it person. So i did and the dude says my total is $800. Didn’t know an installation was over $250 dollars lmao. This place is a joke. He says “gotta cover shipping bro” haha funny guy. Go to express wheels in south gate , they’ll treat you right no BS< /Review><time>1590654513791</time><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<review>If you decide to do business with this establishment please check your wheels before leaving this shop if they drill the mounting holes out for you as mine are not correct. So bad that my car shakes horribly going down the road. They left huge scuff marks on the wheels when they drilled out the holes and charged extra tax which I didn’t notice at first because the handwriting was so bad. Wheels LOOKED great on my car but they came at a price. Not going to tell you how to spend your money but definitely will not be spending mine here if my life depended on it. Customer service is horrible. You may think you are getting a deal but what will it really cost you in the end? Messed up car and court fees? God bless and happy shopping.</review>< rating>

<Text>Great variety, great customer service. The owner, Adrian, even gave me his personal line so that i could ahold of him at odd hours due to my hectic work schedule. Very happy with my purchase and the effort of the employees to build both of my rides to my specifications. Best prices on Giovanna Wheels  and Asanti Wheels in all of Los Angeles.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>I wouldn't buy anything from this place, I couldn't even make it through a whole phone call with this clown, absolutely the most incompetent place I have ever dealt with, rude no nothing wanabee, I cant believe he names the place Ballerz, like he actually is, what a joke! With all the competent dealers around I suggest shopping around before sending any money to them, he is more interested in you sending that deposit in then when you start to question him a little bit he hangs up the phone, I couldn't even imagine trying to get a warranty claim or a refund from them, not sure where the reviews he has came from but something isn't right, my guess is that you are talking to someone sitting at home on a cell phone! Beware research this place first for your own piece of mind!< /text>< Pictures>

im with Bill Moran these people are not good business people. I communicated with them about purchasing a set of wheels but the response has been terrible. To make matters wore they dont even have a business line they use a cell phone no real business uses a cell phone and not a landline especially if its a shop.<//text>

They steal money from their customers!
Charging over $300 to add vehicles to your policy when other pleases charge $50. Plus the person in charge is extremely rude, she screamed at my mother because my mother was asking questions about the charges. All they do is steal, please do not go to this place.

Their agents will gladly assist you find the policy that meets your needs at the best possible price. Big downside are their brokerage fees; I was being charged over $300 to modify my policy which I didn't have to pay by contacting the insurance company directly. What I recommend you do is to ask them for the quote estimate and call that Insurance company yourselves.</text>

<date>1517182549420< /date><Rate>1</Rate><text>On Dec. 29th, 2017 I went in to cancel the insurance I had with Alliance for an older car. Also, I went to get a quote for a newer car that I had just purchased. I have had good experiences with other agents, but not with Lucero. Lucero did not cancel my insurance for the older car so I had to pay for the month of January for a car that was not under my care anymore. Now, there is no way I can get my money back because Erika, the supervisor, I am assuming, said that I have used the insurance for the month of January and there was nothing on file proving that in fact I had cancelled the insurance. I do remember signing a document, but then again Erika said there was nothing on their end. One thing I did mentioned to Erika that if her agents were properly trained they should know the process. Honestly, some fault falls on me because I called at the end of the month to follow up instead of attacking the issue right at the beginning but I trusted Lucero with the cancellation. I had automatic payment set up for the policy so Lucero said that although the money was going to be withdrawn from the account I would get my money back because Alliance needed a 10 day notice prior to cancellation. So I waited like a dumbass, thinking that I would eventually get my money back but I did not. Anyway, if you plan to cancel any policy with these people make sure you get a copy of the cancellation or at least that they do their job right and complete all the documents required for cancellation. Advice: Go to a different insurance broker. I have a busy life like other people and we need things to be done right the first time. We do not need people like these who wash off their hands and are not accountable for their mistakes.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We have added a new vehicle to the policy and the representative Lucero explained our coverage to us in detail. We have myself and my husband four years with Monas Auto Insurance, we will recommend them with family and friends for their excellent service to the client.

(Translated by Google) I loved the service. I made the change of car title in less than 20 minutes. They treated me fast and I didn't have to wait 3 hours in a line. Thanks to Victoria.

The maintenance crew at Avalon Eaves, especially Richard are amazing. Any time I have an issue (which is rare but has happened), they go above and beyond. In one instance recently I was having issues with a dusty air vent. Richard personally called me after putting in a written request on their site. He came over immediately and checked it out himself. After assessing the situation he recommended  calling in a professional Hvac company to do a thorough job, as it is their specialty. Richard personally scheduled their first appointment, and managed the entirety of the project moving forward. He kept me in the loop and made sure all the work was completed correctly. I thought it was great that he took control of everything and didn't try to do a quick fix of the problem. Two days later he personally followed up to see if everything was working out, and if I had any questions. I have lived in many apartments and can honestly say that Richard cares about the tenants and is fully committed to giving top notch service. Very impressive.<//text>

Maintance service at the Eaves San Marcos is outstanding.  I called in for the first time and spoke with Axel, I told him I was new here and I’ve never had to make a service call before.  He was so friendly and helpful and got my service ticket all set up.  Not long after that, there was a knock on the door and Darin introduced himself.  Darin was incredibly polite and respectful.  I asked him about the smoke detector as he was replacing the battery in it.  I was pleased that instead of acting like it was a silly question, he provided the information I asked for.  Overall, I couldn’t have been happier with the service today from Axel and Darin.  Thank you both!</text>

And the maintenance team? INCREDIBLE. Darin in particular has serviced several of our maintenance requests and is always kind, efficient, knowledgeable and even provides tips to prevent future issues.

Eaves San Marcos has been our home for the past 3 years, and we have loved being a part of the community here. We fell in love with the area, the amenities on site, the park behind the property, and the top notch elementary school in walking distance.

The team at Eaves is top notch! JJ and Hanna were the first faces we met when touring places for a cross country move and they were extremely helpful!  Any maintenance issues during our time here have been fixed promptly by Lupe, Darrin, and Richard. We felt very taken care of any time we needed assistance with our apartment.

Our building 837 has the most fantastic views, and we have felt very blessed living here.

We have personally recommended this place to people who have asked us about the apartments, and we will continue to highly recommend Eaves San Marcos as a great home and wonderful apartment style living community.</Text>

<Text>Shout out to Richard and the rest of the maintenance team at Eaves San Marcos!! My wife and I were showed a remodeled unit before signing the lease but when we got our unit it turned out it wasn't remodeled. Richard took things into his own hands and ended up helping us out with free upgrades on literally every the new models had short of new cabinets. new blinds, new ceiling fan, new mirror in the bathroom, new bath rub with shower rod, new lights, new mirror sliding doors over linen closet (shutter doors before). He really hooked it up! Then our dryer was having some problems but Richard and the team fixed that with ease! Great guy, and super solid maintenance team at Eaves San Marcos.< /Text>< user>

<Date>1607118819496<//Date><rate>5< /rate><text>My Fiancé and I made a huge move relocating from Northern California to Southern California, during a Pandemic non the less. While searching for apartments we applied to many places and spoke to a bunch of different places all to which made us jump threw loops to get approved and send tons of documents all threw email or mail. It was lengthy and stressful so when I found Eaves at San Marcos I was pleasantly surprised to receive a phone call the following day after inquiring about their 1 bedroom apartments to realize they don’t require a proof of employment and actually TRUST their soon to be tenants. We got approved that SAME day! Upon arriving to our apartment, we had a mix up and ran into some issues with the 1 bedroom and needed to moved, JJ at Eaves in San Marcos helped us out and moved us to a better apartment and we couldn’t be happier. The shopping across the street is very convenient, literally a 1 minute walk to Wal-Mart and other restaurants. I highly recommend Eaves of San Marcos for the easy and stress free move. I’d also
Like to give Darin the maintenance man a huge shout out. He came and installed a new dishwasher for us and did an excellent job! We are very grateful for his services! Thanks Team at San Marcos !<//text>< Pictures>

I have had nothing but great experience with maintenance. They usually come the same day, that I put in a request. They are all very friendly, and hardworking. I have no complains with this team, at all. I want to especially recognize, Richard (maintenance supervisor). He's very polite, friendly, finishes everything in a timely manner. Makes sure everything that he works on, is top notch work and leaves the area clean. He goes beyond his job requirements, and is always ready to give a helping hand. He runs a great ship, with very hard-working guys. Thank  you, Richard! So grateful for having amazing maintenance group.</review>

<text>Darren Kelly is really amazing. He takes intentional effort to understand what is wrong. Today, I put in a request around 10am and left until 4pm because I thought some electrical issues were happening in our apartment. When I pulled up, Darren happened to be walking by my car and said that surprisingly he checked each outlet and confirmed it wasn't electrical, it was truly all 4 lights had gone out at the same time! He is a superstar because: 1) he knew who I was when I pulled up 2) knew our issue and 3) just as friendly and kind as can be. I love this place because of Darren. I can always count on him to do a great job.</text><userid>105027026377335339952</userid><username>Shannon N<//username></record>

She was nice in the beginning of our leasing process but as soon as I had questions right before signing our lease (thankfully I didn't go through with it) she began to give me attitude and talking to me in a demeaning manner. "I've been working here for over 10 years hunny so I know what I'm talking about." What kind of response is that? She needs to be retrained in her position because obviously after 10 years she thinks she can talk to future customers however she wants. I had already given my security deposit and been approved but thanks to her unprofessionalism I changed my mind because I figured we would have to deal with her attitude in the future if we wanted to live here so we're going to look elsewhere.

I am coming to the end of my lease here at the Eaves and I honestly have to say I am a little sad to be moving from such a wonderful apartment. The maintenance team here is phenomenal. Lupe always has such a positive attitude servicing anything in our apartment. So far, he has fixed our dryer, bathtub, window seal mold, and door frame. Despite the many request, Lupe and his team responded within 24 hours of our request. The maintenance manager, Richard, always stepped in when it was a two man job. Richard is a problem solver and is great at communicating with the residence about the job at task and gives good estimates for when the job will be done. Darren has also come to help replace the blinds when it was dismantled. All in all, this is a great team that takes care of their residents issue when needed. Big thank you to Lupe for always having a smile on his face every day that he is here.<//Review>

Apartment was conveniently located, but the office workers are terrible. Lived here for 3 years and I constantly had issues. Was a very prominent area for college students and I would constantly have to deal with noise complaints and smoking. By the end of your lease, I suggest you basically clean the apartment like brand new or else they will charge you a ridiculous amount of money.< /Text>

Eaves, San Marcos is a great place to live.  It is convenient to the freeway and shopping areas.  The staff is fabulous.  They quickly respond to any maintenance requests.  I put in a request this morning and Lupe was at my door within hours to get the kitchen sink unclogged.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.
Eaves is also pet friendly, even big dogs are welcome! For those of you who have large dogs you know how hard it is to find a place that accepts them.</review>

I have been a resident of eaves San Marcos, since September 2017! I have really enjoyed my stay here! The complex is quiet, comfortable and well equipped with what I needed personally (full-sized washer/dryer, hard wood floors in parts of the apartment, spacious patio, walk in closet, sizable storage on the patio and great neighbors). The apartment is centrally located to the freeway, shopping and even hosts great places to get your nails done, eat a great meal and a great place to walk and be outdoors. I love the management team, especially JJ (Jeannette) and the new maintenance manager, Richard. They are kind, thoughtful, professional an always available if I need something. It's a great place to live and I am grateful for the recommendation to move here! - Lisa H. Resident<//Review>

A big thank you to Jeanette in the leasing office. She went above and beyond her job duties. I was at work and I could not get a hold of my elderly mother on the phone who lives with me. I called the leasing office and asked Jeanette if she could go to my unit and check on my mother. Without hesitation Jeanette said yes. Jeanette was able to make contact with my mother and found out her phone had died and plug it in for her. Jeanette called me back and informed me my mother was fine and that her phone had died. I was so grateful. Thank you again Jeanette your awesome.</text>

<Text>Me and my husband have been living here for about 7 months now with our teenage daughter.  We love the amenities.  The apartment is very up to date with new appliances.  The apartment comes with a full size washer and dryer inside the apartment which is really nice.  We've only had to contact maintenance once and they came right away and fixed the issue.  The management is wonderful here.

My husband and I and our roommate moved in in July and not gonna lie, the first month has been a bit rough. While we love the apartment itself, we've had appliance issues. However, with that said, the staff at Eaves San Marcos is so incredible. Every time we have had an issue, Steve, the maintenance guy and Hanna at the front office have been so nice and accommodating. They take care of the issue in a quick and timely manner. We are overall very happy with our decision to rent here. We hope that the remainder of our lease goes a bit more smoothly but we know that if something does happen, they are on top of it, so we're not too worried about it. They are also great with our dog that is there during the day, we have no problems with them going in and out while we are not home. Although we have never lived in an apartment before and do not know how other apartments handle their tenants, this has been a great first experience.</Text>

<text>I got a voice mail today from our maintenance manager asking if we needed someone to let our dog out of our bedroom after an inspection. I have never been more pleasantly surprised with an apartment complex. While I didn't need the assistance, it was still so unexpected of a southern california apartment community, that I had to say thank you to the Eaves San Marcos team for making such a thoughtful offer.

One additional pleasant comment about this community is when our lease renewed this year it was actually a reasonable increase. Living in north county for several years has accustomed me to the annual $100-$200/mo. Increase in rent at every renewal. When eaves renewed our lease this year it went up by aprox $60 a month which considering everywhere else I've lived, was out standing!

Thank you to the Eaves San Marcos team!<//text>< pics>

Since I moved in, everything in the apartment and community has been top notch.  The leasing process is so easy and JJ took the time to walk me through every step of the way.  I deducted one star for a few minor maintenance issues- all were handled right away by Steve and Lupe.  I am so glad that I chose to live here!</Review>

< review>
The leasing office lady was extremely rude when I asked her where the leasing office was located. I had made a turn too soon and ended in another property so I called to ask where the office is located she responded with, "I can't believe you can't find the office its right by the tennis courts right by the pool" Her tone sounded frustrated and very condescending. She then proceeded to say, "I'm baffled at how you can't find it, that's amazing you can't miss it!." After that phone call I already knew I did not want to rent an apt here even if I liked it. I believe as a leasing office manager or rep. People who work in the leasing office are often the first people you talk to at the property and the first impression is always important. During the tour she started talking about a 2bdr (I'm looking for a 1bdr but i like to have options) so I asked if she could show us a 2bdr. She gave me a face of disgust and ask if i planned on having a roommate or if it was just for me. This is my first time looking for an apartment and this was the first apartment tour I've ever been to and I was disappointed on the way I was treated. Also, make sure to look at the corners of the tub they are black and rusty. I'm not one to write reviews but I felt that the way I was talked to was rude and unprofessional. There are other reviews on yelp explaining the tone of voice the lady has. Please look at reviews before renting/purchasing anything. I believe the leasing office lady's name is Jeannette she goes by "JJ".

I will say JJ does know her property and sells it well by the knowledge she has of it.< /review>

We have a great fitness center and pool, as well as nice grounds  It's safe here and fairly quiet.  When I have problems in my apartment or concerns, Steve and Lupe address it promptly, and the office staff is wonderful (Holly, JJ).  I'd recommend it here.  The only drawback...it's a bit pricey.

Wow... to think this place has good reviews. GO CHECK YELP! It tells the truth.

Btw, Jeanette is one of the leasing ladies at Eaves and I have honestly not met someone so rude and condescending towards tenants. I called looking for something in my old apartment, mentioning how getting a hold of them was hard and she immediately dismissed my complaint as if I was not only wrong but how dare I even say that sorta thing went on, I was just so shocked. How can someone be so unprofessional towards a tenant at your own job?! Still in disbelief, they need to work on customer service skills... ESPECIALLY JEANETTE!!! (And if you check yelp... others complained about her too)</text>

Hi everyone my name is Luisa Jimenez and after 20 years in a relationship I recently became a single parent with 5 beautiful children. So as with every divorce my credit just waved goodbye and flew out the window. I would hear about Paul Blanco Good Car Company and how they help people like me. So I went and Herbert Giraldo was kind to see me and my daughter and take care of us. I was so sure that I was going to walk out the same way I walked in, empty handed. But what a surprise!!!!! We got approved for a 2016 Hyundai Accent. Now I can start my new life with a new car and if I can do it you can do it too!. Thank you Paul Blanco< /text>

The salesman Matthew really went out of his way to be sure he was able to get me into a car. I had a very tough situation, and with his help and communication, he really made it possible to get a decent car that was comfortable for my 3 daughters. He never gave up on my case, even though he really could have. With that being said, his hard work is very much appreciated! Thank you Matthew!</review>

< review>
I came in with low expectations because of my low credit score. I knew I was not going to get to pick the car of my preference and expected a very high interest rate and crazy down payment. I sat down with Jonathan Buss and told him I don't want to spend a lot of wasted time looking at cars out of my budget and only wanted to know if they could finance me. I figured I could get a ball park figure and maybe have to come back with a down payment another weeks later. I was very pleasantly surprised with Jonathan's friendly, laid back professionalism as he gathered all of my income documentation and asked for my preference in price, style of car and how quickly he was able to come back with a payment within my budget AND the car I had looked at out in the lot (secretly wishing I could afford it)! This may sound like a fake review or a made up commercial but this really did happen and I really appreciate the Paul Blanco fresh start credit program! I am now a believer!

I bought my car earlier this Christmas Eve. When I tell you that I was in dire need of a good vehicle at a fair/good monthly payment, Nick and team answered the call and then some.

I went in skeptical, as I have challenged credit and had already been denied at several other dealerships. However, from the moment I stepped on the lot, the approach was all about trying to solve my problem and get me in the car I wanted... AND THEY DID!

I got a great car and a better than expected payment. Also, I was in a rental car, and Nick even followed me to rental car location to help me drop off rental and get me into my new vehicle.

No exaggeration, this is where you want to go to buy your next car. They really have "good cars and good people." There is nothing more you can ask of a dealership and it's team!

Thanks again Nick and team! You guys made my Christmas and helped me end 2018 with an amazing bang!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Best service ever, people there are nice and cooperative. I came on the lot thinking I won’t be able to leave with a car due to my status. Then I met Nick! The best salesman I’ve ever met. Straight forward, no bs, and no hassle. He and his team made sure I left happy. Best day of my life by far! 08/08/2018
Again, Nick is the man that looks out for his customers. I’m am satisfied!< /Text>

I purchased a car from this location at the end of December.  The service was amazing and I would refer people to visit here to purchase a car.  I got the payment I wanted and the down payment I needed.  My disappointment comes from the condition of the car.  Which I take responsibility for not checking in more detail.
1. Within 24 hours I found the one of my passenger window will not roll down from the button on the door, but I can control it from my door (the lock is not on)
2. One of the third row seatbelts does not buckle, so I can not put my child back there like I had hoped.
3. Numerous vent and plastic covers are broken and off and I can not get them to stay on.
4. Stains on my ceiling
5. About two weeks after I purchased I am notified that the air bag is not working.

Now I understand that I signed an "as is" contract, but I feel that there was a lack of pride in the product that was sold.  Why was the car on the lot to sell if not in working order? Makes me wonder what else wasn't checked....  The lesson for me is now when I buy a car I will roll down every single window, check all seat belts even if I have to crawl in the third row and check all plastic covers.
God only knows what it will cost to fix the window, seat belt and air bag but it sucks that I have to fix them before I made my first payment....<//review>

Nick Buss was outstanding. He and his team were able to help me get into the truck that I really wanted. It was hassle free and he was very professional, honest, and quick. No games, no getting people's hopes up. Just honesty and dedication to the customer. I recomend buying a vehicle from them in the future. Awesome staff and great selection of cars!  Nick is awesome!< /text>

I have bought several cars from them but this will be my last...

Make sure you get in Writing that you will receive

Working Key Fob

Rug Mats

Car Manual before you buy

My Wife and Mother have just purchased a car this weekend with Henry at the Norco dealership. Henry’s less than customer service attitude really struck me as odd. I have purchased several cars with you in the past. One was 2014 Chevy Cruze as well as 2015 Chevy sonic. Both of those experiences were great. However purchasing my third car from you has not been so pleasant. Henry sold us a 2017 Hyundai Elantra and this time around, we feel like your Good car Company has shafted us. We test-drove this car and it had a key Fob “My wife remembering seeing the Key Fob”. We signed the contract and then was given a random key and told bye bye by Henry. Henry did not congratulate us as previous salesperson have. We were made to feel like he was doing us a favor and not giving us customer experience that was before. I asked about the Fob that my wife had seen before and we were told this is all you get. Very completed I asked again about the Fob Henry sighed and said he would go see if he could find one. Henry came back with a 2018 Fob and told me that I would have to pay to get it working with my car. The experience that you have given me is not what I would expect from your company let alone when a Roach climbed up my wife’s leg and Henry did not bat an eye you can still probably see the roach smooched in his carpet. What happened to your customer service?

Update i will get a manual for my car that they will send out. Lets see if it arrives...<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>I purchased a car in April of this year. It was a 2016 and I was hesitant at first. After thinking about it I decided to go ahead and purchase the car. The office staff was typical--salesman passed me off and the money people were in no hurry to get the paperwork prepared and ready to sign. They were busy chatting with each other. That  in itself would Normally have been frustrating,  but they were well aware that we had a fussy 18 month old toddler with us. Extremely frustrating!! Deserving of 0 stars.

The reason for the four stars in Fatima Williams. She  is in there Sacramento office and is the liaison with the DMV.  When I spoke with her yesterday and explained that I still have not received the license plates for the car she immediately researched why not. Apparently no one requested license plates for the car. We do have the registration and the tags but nothing to put them on. Once again BOO  to the people at the local office. Fatima sent me the paperwork via email within 10 minutes and  reassured me that as soon as she received the paperwork, the license plates would be in the return mail. I appreciate all of her efforts in getting this handled promptly  and feel confident that I'll have the plates as soon as possible.< /review>< pictures>

Nick Buss went out of his way to get me financed in my first car. I totally recommend him because he's honest and knows what he is doing. Before I went in I read the reviews on the website and seen that he was recommended by so many people with a five star rating. I walked out a very happy man

Everything about the entire process was painless. The salesman Matthew was very professional and attentive. I got the vehicle I wanted, and with a low down payment and low monthly payments. Everything was fine until I got the car home... the technicians did not torque the oil drain plug and it eventually fell off in my driveway bleeding ALL of my oil out.</Review>

I went in to buy my first car. I knew what i was walking into knowing my credit history and what i wanted for monthly payments.  I had nick buss for my salesman and he made the process quick and easy and explained any thing that i had questions on.in fact the whole team  made sure  i was informed  and were happy to answer my questions.  I felt confortable and  i was extremely  happy when i was able to  drive out  in a jeep compass  without a cosigner and low payments. If anyone  is looking for a new car i would try this place out who knows  it may be the right place for you, it was for me !!<//Review>

<Review>I am so grateful for Nicholas Buss for his hard work in getting me in my car. Paul Blanco has helped my family and I get back on our feet when I thought no one was ever going to finance me! I appreciate their very upfront procedures and the fact that I really did feel that everyone (including the people at the corporate office) went above and beyond!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I have to give a huge Thank You to SAM! He is a great salesman made us feel comfortable right from the beginning. He helped my son get his beautiful 2016 Charger. I'm also thankful my son remembered his name from a previous visit. Upon walking in, had I been alone I would have waljed right back out. First impressions are everything and when we walked inside 1 salesman was sleeping on the couch, the other was relaxed in a chair on his phone. Sorry, that's why SAM gets my sale. I maybe be back worth SAM for 1 more.</Text>

My family and I came from San Bernardino to help my sister find a new car and had the privilege of being serviced here at Paul Blanco's Norco location.We were helped by Sam who was very friendly and  exceeded the expectations of great customer service. He was quick to answer all of our questions and was very considerate of our what we were looking for. Needless to say, my sister is now a happy owner of her 2017 Toyota Corolla</text>

Just traded in my Camry that I still owed money on for a almost new Tacoma and the sales guy Matthew made the process easy and stress free. They gave me top dollar for my trade in and Jason got me a amazing deal on financing and also went above and beyond to make sure I got the truck I wanted. I will never buy a car or truck anywhere else!</Review>

My wife and I both went in just to take a look at what we can do. Our salesman Nick Buss was awesome, totally honest and upfront with us. Did everything he could to make us comfortable and even found ways to go above and beyond anything we could ever ask. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a car to go see Nick.</Review>

When I was shopping here I was told by the sales guy that after a year of making payments on time I could trade in my vehicle or refinance for a lower interest rate, I chose not to go with them because I knew I could go anywhere and do that. My dad went in and was told the same thing and decided to get a car from here. The sales person was not clear from the beginning, was inaccessible just a few weeks after the sale and a year later we were told that refinancing was never an option here. Multiple calls have been made to speak to a manager, we are always placed on hold and still have not spoken to anyone past the initial sale. NEVER come here they are not out for the little guy they are just another shady car dealership.<//Review>

Very simple ......... file bankruptcy n start over.... it’s not worth paying for a use car twice the amount that the car is being sold.....don’t get caught in the moment and sign for example the car I want is for $21,956 at 19% interest payments at $545.56 for 72 months comes out close to $40,000 for a 3 year old car with 30,000 miles???? Not worth it unless u live with mommy n daddy  n they make u only pay utilities bills.....< /Text>

Not helpful at all. Went in with an urgent need for a car and was told they would help with a down payment due to their various programs. All lies. I wasted hours of my time as well as leaving a friend waiting for us in his car for hours just so they could say NO to us in the end. I was up front since i walked in, they just kept s stalling. They just want sales. They dont really see your need. Not helpful at all.< /Review>

I was very comfortable because I had originally only stopped to see what kind of inventory they had on site. And just had a pleasant gentleman we had a conversation probably should be a fantastic price and why not One Stop Shop I would encourage anyone to at least go by and check it out thank you to Henry and all the staff and have a Merry Christmas< /review>

Tonight  I went to get a Kia SUV, after doing some research before I got there My sales man Henry  (super cool dude) tried to get me into the KIA but said the payment would be $550 a month on an 11K SUV KIA that they were selling for double the price.  After telling him that would not be possible and I thought it was way over priced he brought in his manager. After explaining the retail for the KIA is worth 11K and they were trying to sale it for 20K used he said the only way I would be able to get into the KIA is if and only I put down a huge down payment that made no sense and my monthly payment would still be $550 a month. Unfortunately I did not leave with the KIA and I'm glad because their cars are way overpriced. Again Henry was super cool and tried to help but we could not make a deal.< /Review>

Called before I went because I came from about an hour away, so I was very clear about my situation I had bad credit no cosigner and they told me everything I wanted to hear. They said they are more based off your income that they don't really care about your credit, and that I pre-qualified through the phone just based off my income saying I was good to go to get a car. When I got there they ran my credit asked me if I had a cosigner, mind u I had already explained my whole situation to the guy before as well. Just to tell me that I was not approved and I needed a cosigner and that I dont qualify because of my income which is what they told me In the first place that, that's why I did get approved. Worst experience ever I don't recommend.</text>

<text>It was quick no pressure no hassle and stress free process. The whole thing too about 3 hours. My ac stopped working and they fixed it no questions asked, gave me a loaner car. If you have challenged credit and little money to put down this is the place to go. Buy a car from them and find out for yourself.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I was very comfortable because I had originally only stopped to see what kind of inventory they had on site. And just had a pleasant gentleman we had a conversation probably should be a fantastic price and why not One Stop Shop I would encourage anyone to at least go by and check it out thank you to Henry and all the staff and have a Merry Christmas<//review>

Our experience here was wonderful! Jose helped us, and he helped us pick just the right car for our family. We went in thinking that the most we could afford would be a cheap compact 4 door sedan, but he showed us a 6 seater Mazda 5 that we just fell in love with. It was the exact car we needed for our family that we never would have looked at because we never thought it would be something we could afford. Thank you Jose!</Review>

Wow! The easier car buying process EVER. It was an amazing and beautiful experience. My spouse and I moved across the country 2 years ago and accrewed some debt in the transition. Our salesman Herbert was so easy going and helpful. Our finance manager was incredibly educational and they didn't make us feel bad about our credit score! They encouraged us and even talked with us about helping fix our other car. I am so elated by the way it all fell together and I walked off the  lot with a beautiful vehicle and a fresh start to my credit. Thank you guys so much!< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Purchased a 2016 Camry in May and now I'm having battery issues after 7 months with the vehicle. They cannot replace it since their 30 warranty has expired. A used 2 year old vehicle should not be having battery issues. They exchanged the original Toyota battery so Toyota cannot honor their 7 year warranty and replace it.
Another issue is my plates. Still have not received them. Contacted DMV and confirmed Paul Blanco did not request new plates for the vehicle and they should have mailed them to me. Terrible< /Text>< Pictures>

Had to purchase a car immediately and we weren't sure if we would even get any kind of approval due to the previous weekends outcome. Apparently, Nick, who was extremely new  (his first day) had helped us get into a pretty new SUV with a fair monthly car payment. I was thinking that a car was out only option to keep lower payments but Nick had helped us get into an SUV for our family. I really appreciated the time they took with us, especially in the beginning when we were very indecisive.  Thanks Nick and glad we could be your first sale.</text>

I'm rebuilding my credit and they gave me money for a trade towards my down payment, and they judged other factors beside that darn credit report.

Though I was unclear how to handle certain aspects of what they needed, they were always patient, willing to work with me rather than being stringent. Keeping the goal of helping me to find a car to meet my needs as the first and highest priority. Rather than a company looking to the bottom line first. A great big thank you to Henry and Jason.</Review>< pics>

<review>I wish they could run your credit prior to you wasting time driving to their show room for them to say, we're sorry, you have a loan on your credit that's stopping us fron loaning to you even though outs a secured loan with collateral.
I pay more for my rental, almost double what is pay for a new car, and they can loan me enough to purchase my own. Doesn't make sense to me, but maybe someone else will be luckier then I was.
It's an ok company just not quite what I expected from their advertisements.</review>< pictures>

<text>Great place especially if you are a young first time buyer. The finance team really works to get the best deal. Tony and Jason really are the best.</text>< gmapID>

am leaving this review today, and I don't usually do this, to inform any potential car buyers to go to Paul Blanco. I was always treated like I've been there many times, like a friend. My buying experience was great, and Paul's finance department ACTUALLY got me financed! I'm rebuilding my credit and they gave me money for a trade towards my down payment, and they judged other factors beside that darn credit report. Overall great experience and I enjoy my new Chrysler 200S! Thanks Charles. Thanks Paul</review>

<review>This was a pretty easy transaction. I have poor credit after a divorce and really wanted to buckle down and get my stuff together. I applied online, they said I was approved. Went in and met with Henry. He helped get the process started. We walked the lot and we talked about what I could get and what I couldn't. Met with Jason, finance, who really is helpful and transparent about my situation. I am in sales also, so I am very leery of other sales people. (I know I know) It was almost painless. LOL! I feel I got a fair deal for what my situation is. The customer service is very good here. Henry and Jason were always available to answer my questions if I was there in person, phone, or via text. I started this process on the computer. I went down for the initial meeting which was about 90 minutes, which resulted in my picking a car, and working the numbers. I had a list of things that I did want. It's always the little things that matter. Like the SD card for navigation, floor mats, warranty, washed and detailed when I pick up please. Oh and my payment needs to be here. Once that was all squared away and we had a deal we were all happy with, I came back the next day and closed paperwork with Juan. WHo was also very nice and answered all of my questions. I am gonna give them 5 stars because they really wanted to work with me. My only two suggestions... Owners manuals for the cars are a MUST! I was disappointed when mine did not have one. And the gas tank should be filled up before the customer leaves the lot. Because I had to stop for gas on the way home and had to You Tube where the gas lever for the gas tank was to get it open. Little things guys! All in all very satisfied.<//review>< Pictures>

The staff at Paul Blonco are top notch. I have never had a good experience when buying a car because of the runaround car dealerships give you . This time was different no time was wasted waiting for these guys I was in and out in about an hour so by the time we left with my wife’s new car I was still in a good mood the staff are top notch thanks again Paul blonco you guys rock over there  👍<//text>

I wanted to thank my salesman John Buss for his great customer service. Usually car salesman are very pushy but John wasn't. He made it clear that he was there to help us and that he did! My husband and I walked out with our dream car a 2014 Ford Flex. I would definitely recommend John to my friends and family. He made us feel like his friends and not just another customer. Thank you again John.</review>

< Review>
I was absolutely terrified of the whole car buying experience at first but Tony and the other gentleman that helped me really broke it down and made it simple and they definitely worked with my budget. I couldn't have asked for more helpful guys to get me through this.
Tony definitely brought the fun and personality to the table. A total asset to that company, in my opinion. The music and Lazer show he put on for us was awesome...where else would you find that kinda fun!?
I will be sharing my great experience with everyone! Thank you Paul Blanco team!<//Review>

I had a great experience here at Paul Blanco . The staff was great and very professional. I highly recommend them. If your thinking about purchasing a vehicle come on by and ask for Javier Sanchez, he's the sales person who helped my husband and I. He will definitely help you  out, just like he did for us.< /Text>

Nick Buss was our sales person and we had came into see if we could trade our car in, and although the car wasn’t worth much they were willing to give us another car but we couldn’t except the offer because my boyfriend and I couldn’t afford two car payments. I thank our sales person Nick for doing everything he could.< /Review>< Pics>

And they don’t work with all types of credits.  Their  finance  Manager was very rude. He laughed when I told him I needed a lower payment. He wanted 1000 down and in 3 weeks another 1000. He was upset that i didn’t like any of the cars shown to me. And then he told me I wouldn’t  find anything else any where else. Well I got into a Chevy Impala 2016 way lower car payments then the Nissan Sentra and Altima he was trying to get me into.

Pretty good selection of vehicles... Don't go in if you need to trade-in a vehicle worth over $20K though (they won't buy it from you).  If I was looking to get into a used vehicle and had med-poor credit, this is where I would go.</Text>

So far a good experience. My fiancé and I don’t have the best credit and we were still treated with respect and the willingness to work with us.  We haven’t made a purchase yet, but we will be going back to work out all of the details.  The sales manager and agent stayed late to help work through our paperwork.  Very grateful to find a company that looks At you like a person and not just a credit score.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I was in a tough spot recently but I was fortunate enough to be helped by a gentleman named Nick. The car I had been driving the past few years finally quit on me the week before Christmas and I needed to find a reliable vehicle quickly. It didn’t help that I had poor credit and as I continued to shop for cars, it just started to seem like I wasn’t going to get what I needed. Luckily, I heard about Paul Blanco and how they can help people in my situation. Upon arriving, I was greeted by Nick who had also happened to be a customer of mine for some years at my place of work. He quickly gathered the info and preferences I had for the car I needed, as I had work soon after I arrived. Only a few hours after arrival was I able to drive off the lot in my 2017 Hyundai Elantra and with only 44,000 miles! They even helped me with the down payment by giving me a few weeks to pull it together. Needless to say, I will be recommending Paul Blanco and Nick to my friends and family in the future when it comes to any car purchases. Thank you Nick, and thank you Paul Blanco’s Good Car Company!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Paul Blanco advertisers state that they do alot to try and get you a car. Well it took about 20 minutes for them to say no. I have a family memeber that had extremely bad credit and no co-signer and was able to get a vehicle in Fresno Paul Blanco, yet it took Norco Paul Blanco less then 30 min to say no unless I have a co signer. I honestly believe that they simply wanted to go home. It was 8 pm. I went today to a neighborhood dealer family owned, took 3 hours but i drove away with a nice used 2016 Chevy. I work two part time jobs and attend class at USC, and still could not get a car at Paul Blanco Norco, not to mention I drove two hours in LA traffice to get to them.<//Text>< name>

<Text>They turned me down because of my credit & type of income. They told me there was no bank out there but one that would accept my type of income (Lyft Driver) & that bank wanted $5000.00 down.
After that their whole attitude changed with me.
I left Paul Blanco dealership, went to another dealership & with the same credit, same income but this time I got approved with only $1500.00 down & they gave me 30 days to pay out the $1500.00.
DO NOT believe Paul Blanco's commercials & the customer service is horrible.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551<//Gmap_id></record>

Very disappointed will never go back there. They tell you lies they do not try to help you regardless if you make good money or you have a steady job. I walked out of Paul Blanco feeling like a fool! The sales man Henry did absolutely nothing he didn’t even try to help me all he did was walk around while I was sitting in his office waiting.  PAUL BLANCO IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! I do not recommend this place to anyone!< /text>

Let's just say you've been trying to get a car for awhile but to no avail don't give because these guys are the shoulder to lean on. I promise they'll work with you to ensure you get something and I know this because they worked with me and my circumstances when others turned me away. So before you give up run down to your local dealership and talk to someone, you'll most likely leave in your new ride.<//Review>

<Review>Nick Buss is the salesmen who helped us into our new van. He worked hard to make sure we didn’t walk away with nothing. Even with a repo and bad credit they were able to help us. This is the second time we’ve been to Paul blanco. We wouldn’t think of going anywhere else. I highly recommend Paul blanco for your car shopping needs and nick as your car salesmen. Not only was he patient with us he was very patient with our children. Thank you for everything.<//Review><userid>113010252884038797259</userid>< Rate>

I was treated well by Jose Sanchez(sales agent) and John Balogh(general manager). I've never purchased a new car and these guys went above and beyond to help me understand the process and to get me the best interest rate possible. Great experience!< /Text>

It was everything they say in the commercials on the radio. Good friendly people from beginning to end. I got more than I expected for my trade in and didn't have to leave any money down. I got the car I wanted at a good price at a payment I can afford.
Thank you.<//review>

< Review>
My wife and I just purchased a Kia here yesterday. The over all buying experience was good. We were happy with the car but I noticed a pretty big gash in the tire that went down to the threads that should have been caught before the car even went on the sales lot. I told our salesman about it and he said the service department leaves at 3. That seems a little early to me. He said we could bring the car back the next day and it would be taken care of with a wash as well. The finance guy said the same thing. So my wife drives an hour back to the dealership this morning only to be put in a rental car because nobody communicated about a stupid tire. So in short if you want to buy a car at a decent price its great but don't expect much from their service side.<//Review>

This car company is very poor my dad got a car from them they don’t know how to do finance they miss lead you once they get you into a car and what ever bank they put you to says yes then goes oh no we can’t accept this person cause of whatever then they switch you to a different bank and want more money down. They also shred documents that shouldn’t be shredded. All there cars have baddly detail, car is not clean and they don’t clean the car when you get it. I don’t even want to put a star I’d give them a 0. If you don’t agree to there terms they charge you a $500 restocking fee to take the car back.<//review>

<Review>It does not look like a auto dealership at all. From front desk to meeting the agent. No one greet us in a good manner. The agent knew my name and then again he asked me my name. He even knew the stock no. Of the car we want. He showed us the car but it looked like no one touched it ever since it came to their lot. It was so dirty in and out. The agent did not let us test drive without filling the docs. What a misrable place!!. They need to change lots of stuff to be upto date.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>This dealer is like no other I walked in with a bad feeling of not getting approved because of my credit score. when they saw my credit they said no worries have a Leander for you in 10 minutes I had a car loan and in less then an hour I drove off in a nice SUV.
Great sales people. The owner Paul Blanco is down to earth and easy to talk to.<//Review>< Time>

I did a pre qualifying app online and was called to make an appointment to go into the dealership closest to me which was norco. Before making the appointment i asked multiple times if they would be able to find a bank that could finance me as first time buyer and self employed and the rep assured me that they can finance anyone. I asked again instore beforr having my credit run and the sales rep also reassure me. After they ran my credit and and took all my bank statements they then told me that i would have to put down 4000 and a cosigner because i am a first time buyer to get anything which is completely unreasonable and why i asked so adamantly before them runing my credit and wasting my time. Then they proceeded to act as my banker telling me how to build credit and tell me that if i get a real job would i return to there car lot. Completely ridiculous i will never give them my bussiness!< /text>

<Text>The whole radio campaign is fraud I’ve never been so let down. But they’ll do anything to run your credit to get a loan. They do not specialize in special financing it’s all bs and not to mention the guy who helped us office was disgusting with dead flys and spider webs and a dirty desk was appalling<//Text>< Pictures>

Paul Blanco good car company helped me find a car I wanted very fast. I don't have the best credit by a long shot but they worked with me to make things happen. I worked with Nick and John, both good people. If you're lookin for a good car and think you can't do it because of your credit give these guys a shot.
Thanks guys< /review>

<review>I drove out from the Palm Springs area told that I was already approved just to come down with my paycheck stubs and I would be out the door with a car. Needless to say that was not the case at all. I showed up there with everything that I needed and I was told that I needed $4,000 down. If I had $4,000 I definitely wouldn't be at Paul Blanco that's for sure then I was told and that they had another creditor so that they could go through and they would get back to me the next day it is not been 3 days<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>This car dealership is not nice! The Sacramento people are lovely especially the owner and the assistant! Theyre helpful however the norco office is terrible. Customer service is obviously not important. I’m very upset that they threatened me that if I did not make a call to the bank for my welcoming call that the bank would take the deal back. I have the text message saying make it happen and the threat about the deal. I am very upset because I went into their dealership and I was treated not nice as they sold me car then when I went into to finalize they said they couldn’t sell the car because my partner who’s away for military was not here. Then they changed their minds then this message!!! Not happy<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551<//Gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

My wife and I decided to go in to see what we qualify for and we're immediately helped by John Buss.  It's always great when a fellow veteran with integrity and honesty comes along your path.  He assisted us into walking out with a 2016 Jeep Compass...I was very impressed.. Even Mrs. Blanco helped us get a lower monthly payment which we were extremely pleased with... Thanks Paul Blanco!!!<//text>

<time>1535593563302<//time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Horrible Experience! Had the unfortunate luck to be “helped” by Herbert. He introduced himself and seemed friendly at first, we got to his office and not one word cane out of his mouth until he asked for my ID and pay stubs. Very awkward silence not even a simple conversation. He then asked what car I was interested in and said I was practically dumb to choose that car then proceeded to say “But I’ll see what I can do.” He was huffing and puffing the whole time that I was in his office. He then left to see what bank would “approve me”. I decided to walk out because he was being very unkind and rude with his words. I don’t believe that anyone should be treated this way no matter the circumstances they are facing. It seems like he likes to pick and choose who he can “help”. I will NOT be doing any business with Herbert or this company.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>I purchased a truck there and it has been nothing but a nightmare. 3 different tires on the truck, no spare tire, electrical problems,transmission replaced, motor oil 3 quarts low when I got it home to check it. I have had to have the truck towed 5 times. Service depart ment is friendly, but they okie doke the customer. Was told that they changed transmission filter and solenoids on it when I took it to a professional transmission shop I was told nothing was done to it. They over charge you for the vehicle. I would recommend you get gap insurance if you decide to purchase from them.< /Review>< GmapID>

At first I was hesitant to go to Paul Blanco good car company because I read some really negative reviews. Upon arrival I met with my sales rep and was treated very well. I did not feel any pressure to buy. Overall it was on of the best car buying experiences that I have had.<//text>

Took my son to Paul Blanco - Norco to buy his first car & sales agent Eric was incredible!!!! He was genuinely interested in what my son was looking for & needed...  Eric was so efficient that my son walked out with the keys in less than 2 hours! This is our second purchase with Eric in 1 year - very rewarding.<//text>

Very nice people.. Even though i went home without a car because the banks were closed I still have faith this will work, I love how they put the numbers and things together to tell you if your approved first before anything. (keeping it real) Eric is my sales man now, see him when u go he will take care of you.  Wish i could have found this company first before going thru 15 other dealerships.  Thanks Paul Blanco<//text>

**** Update: so while we were at this office they told us that they couldn't get us a loan for a truck with a payment less than $700 a month for a used truck , which was way over our budget and that the loan would be at 20% or more. My husband and I went over to Raceway Nissan maybe a week or two later and were able to get a loan at 11% and a payment of $375 a month for a brand new truck. Be very careful when going to a place like this they are likely to screw you over.

My husband and I came in to the dealership after I had been a pre-approved. I tried to ask questions before driving from Moreno Valley all the way to Norco. I didn't get any answers so we decided to go. We knew going in we were going to be asking for a lot of wiggle room. We also knew it was a possibility we would not leave with the vehicle we were intending to purchase. We were greeted quickly and Herbert came within minutes to come get us. Within the first minute the salesmen basically told us that we are wasting our time and that he was not going to be able to help us. He then proceeded to continue to run our credit and "see what he could do". The entire time he was huffing and puffing and you can tell that he was pretty upset. My husband and I considered just leaving but he said that he might be able to work something out so it didn't hurt to try. He kept insisting that we be willing to pay a higher payment like all salesman do but we are pretty set and want to be able to make our monthly payment so we said we couldn't. At the end of the day he was unable to get the finance department to even look at our application. I'm giving this place 1 star not because we weren't able to get what we were looking for because we knew it was a stretch but because of the terrible customer service that the salesman presented. He made us feel very uncomfortable like we are wasting his time. And if he knew from the start that he would not be able to cut a deal why would he have a sit there and go through the process other than to pass the time. He was rude and made it seem like we were being unreasonable for staying within our budget that we could afford. We will not be coming back and if we do we will not be working with Herbert.< /text>

<Text>They were so awesome and made the car buying process stress free. Having bad credit and other open auto loans all other dealerships said no or wanted high monthly payments and huge down. At Paul Blanco's fresh start program I was able to put a reasonable down and have a low mobthly payment and a great 2016 Hyundai Elantra!</Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>My scepticism antenna was running high. I didn't feel comfortable with the salesman, and felt that he was trying to offload specific cars to us, that after online comparison, were overvalued by a fair amount of money. He was dismissive of proper rational conversation, and he had an aggressive tone, which I didn't understand why. Could I be wrong? Maybe. But this was the feeling I got.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We were contacted by the call center and spoke to Vickie , she made it seem as if she worked at the lot and we were expecting to see her when we went. She promised us the world and 60 days to pay the down payment. When we got there we saw Eric. He was ok but didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Well when all was said and done they could only approve me for was 7000.00! I couldn't believe it. I have no credit I guess that's why! Was very disappointed that night.< /review>

<review>Very nice people.. Even though i went home without a car because the banks were closed I still have faith this will work, I love how they put the numbers and things together to tell you if your approved first before anything. (keeping it real) Eric is my sales man now, see him when u go he will take care of you.  Wish i could have found this company first before going thru 15 other dealerships.

I was sent a lot of texts and emails to come to your location and buy a car I spoke to some one on the phone this person assured me there were several banks willing to work with me so I decided to give this company a shot so after work I spent 45 minutes sitting in traffic to get to your location met with a young man who attempted to help me he left me in his office for 30 minutes while he went to get approval came back and told I was approved for $6,000.00 I said (REALLY......) what the hell. Am I going to buy for $6,000 I was told nothing here I then said well thanks for waiting my time and I left<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551<//GmapID><Text>I went to Paul Blanco yesterday with some hesitation after reading some of the reviews.  I was extremely pleased with the front desk, my salesman, Jose Sanchez, and Jon Balogh, the General Sales Manger.  They were very attentive and found a car that I could afford.  I wasn't in the best of moods, because I was turning in my old Jag that I loved. They gave me a very good trade in price and couldn't of been more helpful with no pressure.  The GM wanted a larger down payment and I just said no and he worked with me.  Overall, it was an excellent experience and I wasn't there all day!!!

place was a sham, no one was friendly,  they did everything backwards.  After they got my "numbers" they said sais this is the type of car.
I said no way, plus their.call center is messed up they lie just to get you in.  Was told they help with down paymemt then im.told its just 1000 they help with and you have 3 weeks to pay it back.
I drove 170 miles round trip to be lied to. Why would i want a chevy sonic its tiny.

Stay far away from this place<//review>

My husband and I have been having super bad luck. We were trying to get a vehicle and our credit is not the greatest. We went to Paul Blanco and we told them exactly what we needed. We were not pressured into anything. My husband met with Eric before I came here with him. He told Eric what he wanted, how much we had to put down and how much we could afford. My husband told him what type of vehicle he wanted and Eric worked with him. He got him into a 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan with low mileage. The other dealerships we tried to go to wanted either massive down payments or wanted to put us into a piece of junk vehicle. I had lost all hope until my husband showed up with a new vehicle. Thank you Eric and Paul Blanco for working with us and getting into a nice vehicle. We will definitely be sending people here and coming back when I need another vehicle.< /Review>

Worst place to go if your getting a car. Good credit, bad credit, no money down, first time buyer etc is all BULLSHARK. They want minimum of 4,000 down and become pushy and rude when you don’t have money to put down. I call this whole place FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. I wouldn’t recommend this place to NOBODY if you want a car go to Mitsubishi there fast friendly and they work with you. After going to Paul Blanco I went to Mitsubishi and I was approved for the year 2017 with a low interest rate with my trade in car. Paul Blanco is NOT willing to work with you they just want to run credit and ask for so much money down. Again WORST PLACE DONT GO THERE ! If I could I’d give this place 0 stars.<//review>

Both Sam and Javier made my car buying experience quick, easy, and painless.  I am super excited to have been able to purchase a vehicle.  Yayy, for a fresh start!  Thank you, Paul Blanco.  Thank you, universe. Luv, me!< /Review>

I was sent a lot of texts and emails to come to your location and buy a car I spoke to some one on the phone this person assured me there were several banks willing to work with me so I decided to give this company a shot so after work I spent 45 minutes sitting in traffic to get to your location met with a young man who attempted to help me he left me in his office for 30 minutes while he went to get approval came back and told I was approved for $6,000.00 I said (REALLY......) what the hell. Am I going to buy for $6,000 I was told nothing here I then said well thanks for waiting my time and I left</text>

As soon as I arrived I was greeted by an older gentleman who seemingly wanted to be helpful. It wasn’t until we were seated that the experience began to unravel. He began asking questions that I had already given answers to over the phone, during the pre-qualification process. Apparently they use a call center, centered in Fresno, but those call center employees relay NONE of the information to the actual dealership. I was given incorrect information, regarding acceptable documents necessary to purchase a car. My credit is far from perfect, however, I was made to feel like I was a waste of time and that my concerns were irrelevant. I was told I would not be able to get financing at any other dealership due to my situation. They brag about having a “fresh start” program, but this individual was incapable of making me feel like I could continue with the process at Paul Blanco. I would not recommend the Norco dealership. I left feeling completely disrespected.</Text>

<review>I have to say they did an amazing job helping us when we went into the Norco office. Javier who helped us was awesome the whole time great customer service and with a smile the whole time. He made the experience feel like I was at a comedy show rather than actually being at a car dealer. I would recommend everyone to go to Paul Blanco not only for a great deal on a car but the wonderful customer service and you should ask for Javier.</review><rate>5</rate><userid>111726191164891754516<//userid><resp>None<//resp><Date>1485496534550</Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was helped by Tony who was respectful and extremely helpful thru out the entire process. I explained it was my first time ever buying a car off the lot. He walked me thru it and in the end I drove off with a beautiful pre owned Hyundai Accent 2017 with a low down payment.  And low mileage. Thank you Tony for helping us into our awesome car and being so nice to our kids who were raising ruckus during the application process. Paul Blanco you Rock. Way to Go Tony.

I was pretty disappointed with the service, from the start it seemed like they were in a really big rush to just get me financed and out the door without even looking at the cars. While waiting on the lenders to get back with the financial info I had to walk the car lot alone and view vehicles with no prices no info and dirty. Once I was approved they showed me a type of vehicle that I told them I wasn’t interested in but they tried to push it anyways. I was surprised that with the amount of advertising that they have that the experience would be better. Needless to say I won’t be going back and I’ll never recommend it to family, friends, or anyone.</text>

<text>Absolute terrible service. Henry Smith is the most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. Extremely half assed. Bad attitude. It seemed like I was bothering him by trying to buy a car. I didn't accept the deal he proposed because the car wasn't worth it. I left he then proceeded to harass me the next day about a different deal while I was at work. When I didn't reply as soon as he wanted me to he went on the call me a flake and admited to making up a false deal to prove to his boss how much of a flake I was. I went in interested in a car and instead got harassed and got called names and treated like trash. I have taken screen shots of the conversation and will be posting it all over social media. Stay away from Paul Blanco and Henry Smith. I'm contacting corporate even Paul Blanco him self and showing the screen shot of the conversation on every social media outlet. They must learn that they can't treat people like this for simply rejecting a deal that any sane person will easily see how bad it is.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Horrible customer service! We drove up, got out of the car and no one walked over to greet us. As we walked up closer, the guy just sat in his chair and asked if we had an appointment. We said no so he said ok, well go ahead and look around anyway. We didn't know we needed an appointment. He said "I'm going to see you a car today" , well no he didn't, we walked out after like 2 minutes. the cars are not washed and had scratches on them.< /review>< Rate>

Bought a 2013 Ford Fusion from them in April 2016 after being referred by a friend who had just purchased a vehicle one week prior. At first I thought it was a wonderful car buying experience, until the vehicle began to have problems such as check engine light and power steering assist fault, all within 45 days of purchase. The extended warranty didn't cover any of the issues and Ford refused to acknowledge that my vehicle should have been included in several recall notices for Fusion models. Dealership was no help when I tried to take the car back, Tidal Wave Finance wouldn't listen when I told them the vehicle was a lemon and asked for help getting into a car that was safe for me and my family, and Ford just kept telling me to take it back to the dealership.

End result I surrendered the vehicle after the engine had to be replaced due to a recall issue. After doing some research, I found out that Paul Blanco was doing the same lemon vehicle sales in Northern California. Please save yourself the trouble and money and don't buy a vehicle from Paul Blanco.<//text>

Was approved online and verified information when they called me. I called them to ask about cars and down payment options and was assured they had a payment program. Went to dealership in Norco and they didn’t have the car. They did not work with me on a down payment program. Waste of time.< /Text>

<Text>I went in yesterday to see about buying my first car. Due to having no credit and very low income I thought for sure I wasn’t getting a car that same day. Until I was introduced to Matthew at Paul blanco in norco he jumped through obstacles to get all my documentation, signature from other parties considering I went by myself. I’m extremely happy to say I purchased my very first car that same day. Everyone was very friendly and acceptional. I’m sitting in my new car very pleased so far. Matthew is phenomenal and made this all possible I highly recommend you ask for him when coming here. Thanks again Paul blanco!!<//Text>< Rate>

<Review>I was quite hesitant to stop by based on a lot of reviews I read over yelp. However I decided to find out for myself and it was actually a quite pleasant experience. Tony or 2_themoon was a cool dude. Had lots of conversation and he took care of me and my car situation. Along with the manager Jason'. I was very limited on what I could offer and they helped substantially. I'd definitely recommend, especially when you're in a tight situation. I wouldn't mind going there agian for my next car<//Review>< pictures>

<Date>1538334209233</Date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I heard about Paul Blanco on KOLA FM. I needed a new reliable car because I’m getting divorced and I’m living on one income, and only have so-so credit.

Within three hours I drove away from the Norco branch in a 2017 Jeep. My salesman, Michael, was so kind and gave fantastic, personalized and careful service. I didn’t put any money down. My personal circumstances were considered carefully and I felt really as though I had been listened to as an individual.

The car has a two year dealer warranty with it. It looks like it is barely driven, is low mileage and was a great price. Michael even followed me home in my new car so I could take it home right away . This kind of wonderful service is very rare and is to be recommended without reservations . Go and see Michael at Paul Blanco, Norco. Absolutely brilliant.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>The worst financing department ever. 4 different Times I was told I was financed and then it didn't go through. When I did FINALLY get financed, I received letters saying I wasn't. So I prepared to turn in the car. Spent my down payment on moving closer to where I work. Then they called and asked for my down payment because I was indeed financed.

Get it together.</Review>< pictures>

The car dealer Herbert Giraldo was an exceptional sales person and we left with a vehicle we wanted with reasonable terms and monthly payments. This is the 22nd vehicle we've purchased with Paul Blanco and this experience was just as comfortable as the first and very fast professional and courteous service. This will be our family car shop forever. Great job Paul Blanco and associates.</review>

We did not realize they were expired right away. When we did it was about three months after we purchased it. My husband has been calling at least once a week to obtain current tags. They keep promising they are in the mail, someone will give him a call back, or they are having them delivered to the store. None of these have happened. I called myself today and left a message for the owner of the company to give me a call back by this Wednesday before 10am or I will be contacting the BBB and an attorney. I would have rated this company, im sorry, this location a negative five stars if possible. The only reason im giving them one star is because I have to do so to write a review. The staff there was great when we were purchasing this vehicle. Since we have had issues and had to call regularly they are rude and disrespectful. Im just trying to get my end of the contract satisfied as they get theirs by receiving my payment every month on time. 😡😡😡</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

Called multiple times to confirm my appointment I spoke to them every time and said yes I would . I asked if they had the vehicle I'm stock that I was interested in.  The females said yes it's on their lot . They told me multiple times that the truck I was looking for was there.  I got there it was not there.  There was not a truck there.  The sales guy was pretty rude and very unhelpful . Said the truck I wanted was out of the area and ibwould need to pay to have it brought down . All and all a really bad bad experience.</Review>

The way they advertised it I thought it was going to be different. It's basically going to a normal dealer which better off going to a dealer ship cause they don't sell rental cars.<//text>

What made us really hate this place was the finance department because they wouldn't work with us to figure out numbers. The guy said he didn't wanna put in all the work because we were undecided about getting the car, but its your job to change our minds. If he would have ran the numbers and they were favorable we would have got the car right then and there and if they weren't we would have returned the next day. He was his laziness that put us off. Literally it's your job to persuade us and do whatever you can to convince us to buy and they failed to do it.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
We came here and we're excited to get our first  car. The guy that was helping us was very creepy and would reveal personal information but did seem nice he was just too much. What made us really hate this place was the finance department because they wouldn't work with us to figure out numbers. The guy said he didn't wanna put in all the work because we were undecided about getting the car, but its your job to change our minds. If he would have ran the numbers and they were favorable we would have got the car right then and there and if they weren't we would have returned the next day. He was his laziness that put us off. Literally it's your job to persuade us and do whatever you can to convince us to buy and they failed to do it.</review>

<time>1509560469851</time><rating>2<//rating><Text>Okay experience...it’s my first time buying a car and they were not thorough. I wanted more accurate information for them to submit to bank and for some reason they didn’t think it was necessary. Got a really bad offer from a bank that was overpriced for a Chevy spark and said I needed a co signer. Told them I’d pass. Went to carmax the day before I went to them and was approved for a 2015 Kia Forte w/ 28k miles, no co-signer and payments exactly where I wanted. And they were way more professional. Just my experience. So I actually regret going there and having my credit ran for no reason at all. Good luck to everyone who uses Paul Blanco.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Paul Blanco maybe able to provide the car, however their banks aren’t providing loans all 125... After months of phone calls and emails, of we can help, our banks want to work with you, I finally go down to the dealership and helping me was not the case... If you have challenged credit, I wouldn’t suggest Paul Blanco...< /Text>

<Text>4/20/18: Still no answers still no help still no registration. All were told is we'll get back to you. Had to file a DMV Complaint (from K-35) and a BBB complaint. Why should I have to pay for Registration a second time with late fees?????

4/4/18: couldn't figure out why all the used cars didn't have plates and come to find out Paul Blanco is known for Not paying registration and not registering vehicles in a timely manner per DMV requirements.
Purchased the car 2/17/18 finally received DMV plates with expired past due tags. Spoke to DMV car was only issued replacement plates, Dealer states registration paid and issued same date as plates ?????? DMV has no record of paid registration, CHP has no record of registration. Paul Blanco Finance manager and DMV rep no longer return or take my calls.
I have to pay expired plus late fees now to register vehicle a second time.

It’s no wonder they won’t tell you information over the phone.  They drag you in and make you waste your time.   Unless you make $4000/mo this place will screw you over.  Saying they want to help....BS.  They made me come out and left me stranded at their lot.  Now I have no car or means of transportation back to my original car.  Thanks Paul Blanco, you wasted my time and money.< /text>

We came to Paul Blanco before any dealer and the told us we needed $2,000 deposit down and a possible co signer. We left a little disappointed.  We went with my mother in law to Toyota of Glendora to try and we both came out with brand new cars! Me with only a $500 deposit and her just signing and driving off. I was able to do it with my own credit and lower deposit with a better and newer car! Thry are just trying to scam people with bigger deposit so they don't end up losing.< /Text>

I found Paul Blanco to be a pleasant and reputable business. The service was down-to-earth courteous thorough they put the needs of the consumer first. It made me realize that there are still honest businessmen and women in the in the Empire I would recommend Paul Blanco to anyone who leads a car even if you're going to the trouble they go out of their way to help you. I will be directing all my future car needs a Paul Blanco and my friends and family will get a recommendation from me. And I just want to take him to the sales representative that helped me kudos< /review>

My fiancé and I went into Paul Blanco to purchase a second car ( we share one but between work and school it's getting near impossible) anyways the gentleman that helped us did a poor job. He seemed very careless, didn't want to even try to help us, quiet honestly gave the feeling that he was annoyed we were even there. We were denied because we have an existing open car loan ( obviously the car we share). He knew that we wouldn't get approved because of the open car loan but still he kept saying how our income combined should be enough to qualify us (mind you my fiancé's income alone would've been enough to qualify us) but that's as much help and feedback we got from him. I recommend if you can go somewhere else please do so it's a waste of time, don't believe the radio commercials; false advertisement. If I could rate it 0 stars I would<//text>

The females said yes it's on their lot . They told me multiple times that the truck I was looking for was there.  I got there it was not there.  There was not a truck there.  The sales guy was pretty rude and very unhelpful . Said the truck I wanted was out of the area and ibwould need to pay to have it brought down . All and all a really bad bad experience.</Text><gmapID>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551<//gmapID><Name>John Rowland< /Name><time>1527007613860<//time></record></dataset><record>

I’ve boughten a few cars in my time and they were nothing short of being traumatic experiences. They lasted all day. The “back and forth” game with haggling. At Paul blanco’s, in a few short hours, I had my paperwork completed, test drove a few vehicles and BAM! Before I knew it..I was leaving with my new car! And the haggling? Was about getting me better prices! Best experience EVER! I will always use Paul Blanco for my car shopping needs and refer everyone I know!!!!<//Text>

I found Paul Blanco to be a pleasant and reputable business. The service was down-to-earth courteous thorough they put the needs of the consumer first. It made me realize that there are still honest businessmen and women in the in the Empire I would recommend Paul Blanco to anyone who leads a car even if you're going to the trouble they go out of their way to help you. I will be directing all my future car needs a Paul Blanco and my friends and family will get a recommendation from me. And I just want to take him to the sales representative that helped me kudos< /Text>

I didn't even know if I would be able to get a car, but the staff explained everything to me, and answered any stupid question I had. First experience buying a car, and I believe they raised the bar for any other dealership. Thank you!!!!!! Oh, and my car is amazing!< /text>

Went here With my siter with only 1000 down. Credit score not so great. 1st car time buyer and everything worked out so great. We treat driveds a few vehicles and got approved for 2016 vehicle. Nick was our sales person and worked with us made ua feel comfortable . We had a few laughs and good conversations. I highly recommended anyone who is looking into buying a vehicle especially. For 1st time buyers they had so many to choose from and they really work with you on Which vechiles fits you most.  Please dont waste yiur time going to these other small lots. Come here they will help you and fimd the right vehicle for you!!.<//Text>

Javi was amazing through this whole experience. He worked and talk is through each step of the way. He really took the time to get to know us and know what was going to work for us. We had our 4 year old daughter with us. He even brought he a snack when we were financing to hold her over untill we were done. The whole staff therebis amazing it really felt like a family. Thank you guys again we are so happy and couldn't have been more pleased with these guys!!<//Text>

Came from 30 miles away after being turned down by nissan westcovina and kia west covina i came here. They at first did what they could on a sunday and than called me on monday today 4/9/18. And told me they are able to get the deal i wish to have and made my day i got the suv i needed to make my life easier .. Thanks to the team amd my car agent nicholas hes a great guy come in and make a deal u wont be disapointed just dont expect a 1000000 dollar car and u can only afford a 10000 dollar car. .. Build that cradit score and come here make that change and make a bettter choice come on down and buy a great low miles car and truck and suv. Mini vans also. I also want to add that the finace girl liz was very good at explaining the contract as well as all other documents i was about to sign. Shes very nice and is very respecctable and explains anything more than once if needed.</review>

<review>We “pre qualified” on their website, but when we got there they told us they had nothing to offer us... The service associate was mediocher at best and the facilities were disgusting... there was ABSOLUTELY no attempt to get our business and quite frankly we felt they could care less..

We left there pretty upset and frustrated and drove straight to drive time. Within 30 mins we approved and selected a truck ( which we were buying for our father )

<Text>Very upset that when I talked to the lady on the phone, i told her all my information, everything that was need to be known. Credit score, what I was looking for and everything. I'm told you guys can help me and would get me in a car today. I made it clear that I didn't want to waste my time or money paying someone to drive me out to the location and that today was my only day I could do this do to being on the road most of the time for work. I get there and end up being told that basicly there was nothimg yall can do to help me and I ended up wasting my time and money coming here. You should have the people on the phone more informed and not that the only job they have is to lie to the customer just to get them to come in. Very disappointed by this company. Thanks for the false info and waste of time and money.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

First off the guy who helped us acted like he was on crack. We told him we had a car to trade in, then we disclosed to him that we had bought the car from them 2 years ago. He then proceeded to tell us that the only reason we had gotten a car last time was because the sales person who worked for them and the underwriter were doing illegal processing. So no I do not recommend this place to anyone. By the way the name of the sales guy who acted like he was on crack is John Buss.< /Text>

<Text>I give zero stars. ( had 2 select 1 star to post)
When I was contacted by a Paul Blanco rep after i applied online. We went over my situation.. She stated she documented it in my file and that Paul Blanco could work with my situation. When i got there it was like the Salesman had no idea of my situation and once i explained then the salesman was unprofessional not helpful and had an attitude.  As I left, the manager did not approach or ask if I needed anything.. I am very disappointed in tbe manner in which my appointment was handled, and the lack of customer service that was provided from a company that promotes  its self on helping "Good people" with not so good credit...

Thank you

<text>It was clearly a waste of time. This is not a second chance car dealership. They function just as the rest. You need money down or a co signer for any transaction same as a regular dealer if needed. I explained my situation before going and they were very blunt that they were different from the rest and they weren't. I was informed by a different car dealer as to how Paul Blanco works and it was true. They might be able to help someone but they were not able to help me. WASTE OF MY TIME and gas. If you want a car and don't have much money but need in house financing go to Reposess Auto or Finance Auto in Hawthorne Ca they really work with you.  This is a car place that knows how to help if you make little or a lot of money or you have repos or bad credit.<//text></record>

<Review>I filled out an application online, and the next morning a representative called me. I went in that same day, to the Norco, Can location and was immediately helped by Jonathan Buss. He was terrific! Honest, didn't pull any punches, no gimmicks, no slick salesman speeches, just honest advice and tips to help me get a car. I'm hoping to get one by the end of the week! He was terrific! Thank you Paul Blanco!!! And...John!

Update- I still think that this place is the best place to get a car if your credit isn't so good. I love my car. I only have one small complaint. It's been over two months and I still have not received my permanent license plates from the DMV. I called the DMV and they told me the dealer hasn't turned in the final paperwork yet. So I contacted Paul Blanco, and a girl returned my call and said that I needed to bring the vehicle in so to get could verify the VIN #. SO, I drove all the way from Victorville to Norco to take the car in for the verification. I was in and out in about 10 min. Great right? Wrong! In less than a week later, I received ANOTHER call for me to bring the car in to verify the VIN #!!! I told the person on the phone to that I already did that, and that was only 5 days previous!  I realize that to these people probably sell hundreds if not thousands of cars a day, they get busy. But, they really need to be better on top of stuff like this, those temporary tags on your windshield are only valid for 90 days, mine will expire on May 14th. Will Paul Blanco pay for my ticket if I get pulled over and the cops see that my paper has expired? I don't think so! Anyway, if you buy a vehicle from this company, stay on top of things when it comes to getting your plates, tags, etc. They are very slow in turning in their paperwork and they are not through in this area. I'm just hoping that I get my plates soon!</Review>< user_id>

Freaking joke and we were there not to long ago and didn't drive home with anything but a flipping headache... While waiting,  we weren't the only ones being denied, especially when you here that they want cash on top of a trade in... Besides their prices where way high for used.<//Review>

Someone is got to be Lying I came in with 1,000 Cash And A Trade in and they didn't want to offer me anything. Also they did not care when I told them my car had be
en stolen and I had to pay the impound 410 Dollars. can you believe that 410 Dollars to retrieve my stolen Vehicle and thats the reason I needed to replace my old Car so much incentive and then the man that helped me I do not recall his name gave me a paper and said it's my credit score for next Time or supposdely for people don't try to rip me off but what he really meant by that paper was go try somewhere else. So unless you have great credit and a good down payment which makes no sence in what they advertise I would just skip this Place.<//review>

<Review>Staff was great. But the ads and staff that call you to verify your information are misleading. I was told I was approved for 0-99 down. But when I got there I was told I need 1,500 down in order to proceed. Total waste of time.</Review><gmapID>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551< /gmapID>< UserId.>

<text>DONT SHOP AT PAUL BLANCO!! YOU DONT EVEN GET TO PICK YOUR OWN CAR!!!  This is an expensive ass loan for a car you might not even want. The way I understood the commercial on the radio is that this is a dealership to help people with bad credit. I went in with poor credit and in a desperate situation so yes I did leave with a car I didn't want, a loan I didn't want but my rating is in reguards to the process, and service I've received. While the Sales rep was checking my credit he had me write down three cars I'm interested in so they could see what they could do for me. This pissed me off afterwards because it was completely useless, I'm not sure if they do this to everyone with bad credit but I was not allowed to pick the car that I have to pay off and drive around in, apparently the lender chooses the car for you!! And that's it, no getting around it, 8 months later the dealership has yet to send me my plates, I spoke with the DMV and new plates were never requeated they were suppose to give me the ones from the previous owner, no one at the dealer has even bothered.< /text>< resp>

Paul Blanco's Good Car Company exemplifies the "Good Car Buying Experience". From the time you walk on the lot to the time you drive off the lot you feel reassured and confident that you made the right decision by purchasing a valuable asset such as your next vehicle  at Paul Blanco. The Norco site is clean, their staff is friendly and professional at all times, and their vehicles look pristine. On top of such an amazing facility I was fortunate enough to have endured the car buying process with Charles Gonzales. I had so many doubts and negative belief that I would not be able to purchase a vehicle anywhere after failures at multiple places but once Charles was in the drivers seat I knew that I had come to the right place. I left with an outstanding new car, a stress free car buying experience,  and a great reference on where to send friends and family to buy a car. Thanks again Paul Blanco and Charles Gonzales!</Text>

I'm very grateful for the first class service that Joe Nieto gave me upon the purchase of my vehicle.  I can truly say that he went above the call of duty in making sure I drove away with a new car which replaced a car that was literally on its last leg.  I have referred several people to Paul Blanco since purchasing my car and have told them to talk to Joe Nieto because he truly cares about his customers.  Thank you again Joe and keep up the good work!</review>

< Review>
Got a 2013 Dodge charger back in July the  sales representative and everyone there was very friendly at the time of my purchase I asked them for copies of the carmax and some other papers we signed also for a car key duplicate they agreed to do so by the time we were done with the deal ...well no copies they would mail em to me but NOTHING what about the car key duplicate oh we got your info and the car's so we'll send it to you NOTHING ...3 weeks later the paint on the passenger side door started to peel off called them they would look into it but NOTHING 3 months later no response more paint details started to show manager wouldn't call me oh because he doesn't speak Spanish well guess what I speak English well in that case sir the manager is busy and will call u back  5 months later NOTHING keep getting direct to full voice mail boxes (sal's and Eddie's) the manager have never called  ,no email,no copies, no car key duplicate, paint looks not worth $425 a month seems like they paint the car just to be quickly sold< /Review>

I had such a great experience at Paul Blanco. Joe Nieto went out of his way to help me get into a great car. He made sure i was taken care of and didn't have any worries. The staff there was very friendly, professional, down to earth and just very approachable. I am going to recommend them to my family and friends. I am even considering going back again if i decide to purchase another car from them in the future. Hopefully Joe will still be working there. Thank you Paul Blanco.<//text>

I Came to Paul Blanco's looking for a vehicle to purchase.  I have had bad credit due to financial problems prior years.  I was hoping for a solution as I needed a vehicle to commute with.  Everybody that I had called was of no help.  Joe Nieto from Paul Blanco was very helpful and helped me get into a vehicle.  I was very happy that I was able to buy a car.  Joe Nieto and Paul Blanco's gave me a new start.
I recommend this to everyone that is ready for a new start.</Text>

<review>I was looking for a car due to my car breaking down before the holidays I search and found Paul blanco I was pre-approved on a car then I received a email and then a call from Mrs. Willams from Paul blanco dealership she went over my application over the phone and she also approved me she assured me that I would be approved for a car and told me Paul Blanco works with many lenders. I told her if I come in it has to be a guarantee I told her I had no money to put down she then assured me that Paul blanco will pay the down payment and I will have to pay the dealership ship back. I took a Uber that cost $55 dollars one way to get to the dealership in Narco Ca to be turned down they asked me to get a co-signed I did that to. I had no back up plan to get home due to Willams assuring I would be driving away in a car. I trusted what the agent told me over the phone and I used my last money to get to the dealership only to be turned down. Luckily one of the salesman named Javi Mojavi and his wife Maria lived in my area and offered me a ride home because I had no way home and I was 60 plus miles away from home. I would have NEVER taken that chance if I was told the truth if I was told there was a 50/50 chance. Instead I was lied to and played by Paul Blanco and that’s ridiculous I will not refer anyone here due to the negligence and lies told to me. I have 3 kids and she took the time I had away from them I called off work for this and all for what to leave empty handed. I don’t understand why? Why lie? If it was not for this kind hearted couple I would be stuck in Narco with no way home to my kids. Thank you Javi for your kind heart. May god bless you and your family. Paul blanco hit a gold mine when he hired you!< /review><user_id>102781876111830737326< /user_id><response>None</response><name>bamboo king<//name>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>5 stars are for our sales guy Jon. My wife and walked in undecided and walked out happy . He did everything he could to fit our needs with our car. Great place to go to and the best part about this place is you don't get all kinds of sales people running up on you like scavengers. one place we definitely will be going back to soon. Jon made it comfortable for us and our kids. The one thing I can complain about was the sour ass finance guy. He was a dick and really rude the type that tried to make you feel stupid.  if wasn't for jon we would have walked out. I didn't like that he tried to down talk Jon with his job, very unprofessional!!!!! turns out Jon was right anyway.

<rating>5</rating><Review>My family and I went to Paul Blanco's Dealership in Norco with not too many expectations because our credit scores are very low. Once we arrived, we were greeted by JAVI who was very high energy and friendly. He told us we weren't leaving there without a vehicle and he was right! He not only got us a great SUV with low miles but we got a lower monthly payment than we were expecting with not a lot down! We had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend JAVI and Paul Blanco to anyone that is interested in purchasing a vehicle!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>My sister bought a car here and has been the worst experience for a first time buyer she has a ridiculous interest rate and high payment. Her payment is higher than mine was when I bought my first car for more and a higher interest rate. This place is a rip off do not go here and waste your time and money. Oh and she just got a ticket was told the registration was a year past due and still registered to some guy in Texas if they don't take care of this issue and her ticket there will be a lawsuit< /Text><Date>1457546365899</Date>< username>

I had lousy credit a repo and not much to offer  except my word and 1500 dollars to put down and no co-signer but Chris my sales person and the Paul Blonco team stuck to their word and I left the same day in a new 2016 Nissan Sentra if you can't get it done anywhere else I suggest you stop by Paul Blonco Inland Empire in Norco trust me you'll be leaving with a smile.    Happy customer

The sales rep couldn’t get the deal done. It felt like false advertising when they say income base... it was all about the credit score. I felt mislead. My wife and I felt frustrated and very unhappy. I wanted a truck and he was worried about commission or getting a sale so he tried sleep me a car and a mini van. Overall my experience was bad. The high not is the sales manger was real and upfront with us after we had the dog and pony show.<//review>

Paul Blancos' Good Car Compnay is by far the best car buying experience I have ever had. I am a person with very challenged credit, but the dealership looked past my issues and treated me with fairness and respect. They were able to finance me a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. I was in desparate need of a vehicle, and Paul Blanco Good Car Compnay made it happen. I would recommend them to any person looking for an option to buy a car. I would like to give a special shout out to my salesman John. You did a wonderful job and I am grateful for your services.<//text>

<Review>All bad ....these guys are sharks circling..there are no sticker prices or vehicle info on any of the cars ask for the mileage and prepare for the run around ..they want to run your credit  first and see now much u qualify for and then they adjust the price accordingly...regardless of the kelly blue book ...they take advantage of the hard working  and under paid ....those with credit issues or down on their luck ...make no mistake you will owe an arm and a leg before you leave the place...< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>My experience was the worst experience I ever had at a car dealership. To begin with the sales rep complained about not being a morning person the sales rep did not provide me the necessary information I needed as far as the available cars on the lot they took way too long to service me and it was just an overall bad experience I left the dealership ready to go somewhere else to be serviced and purchase a vehicle I will never go to Paul Blanco ever again</text>< pictures>

<review>PAUL BLANCO LOCATED IN NORCO, CALIFORNIA IS A HORRIBLE PLACE TO GET A CAR FROM. A MONTH INTO ME LEAVING THE LOT WITH A VEHICLE THEY CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME I NEEDED TO BRING IN THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE LENDER SENDING THE DEAL BACK. DUE TO UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN THREE DAYS LATER THAN WHAT I WAS SUPPOSE TO BUT I MADE SURE TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE DEALER. JUAN THE FINANCE MANAGER WOULD NEVER CONTACT ME WHEN I REACHED OUT. ONLY TO THREATEN ME WITH A “recovery team” IF I DID NOT BRING THE VEHICLE BACK THAT SAME DAY. I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER JON AND LET HIM KNOW I WOULD NEED A RIDE HOME IN WHICH I WAS PROMISED! I GET THERE AND ITS A DIFFERENT STORY. THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE KEYS, HAD ME SIGN PAPER WORK TO CANCEL THE DEAL AND THEN LEFT ME HANGING WITH MY TWO KIDS. THE MANAGER TOLD ME “AN UBER IS 60 DOLLARS.” MY CHILDREN AND I SAT IN THE DEALERSHIP FOR FOUR HOURS STRANDED AT NIGHT. EVERYONE ON SHIFT JUST WALKED BY AND SAID NOT A WORD. DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO SEE IF I WAS OKAY AS I WAS CRYING THE WHOLE TIME BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE A WAY HOME WHEN I LIVE TWO HOURS OUT! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I STILL DONT EVEN HAVE MY TRADE IN OR MY DEPOSIT BACK YET AND I HAVE BEEN CALLING ALL DAY TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH IT. WROTE PUTU THE OWNER ON FACEBOOK, SHE SAID SHE WOULD GET BACK TO ME TODAY AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER EVEN AFTER I SENT ANOTHER MESSAGE. SHE READ IT BUT GAVE NO RESPONSE. THIS COMPANY TRULY DISAPPOINTED ME. THEY TELL YOU ONE THING TO GET YOU IN THE DOOR AND ITS A DIFFERENT BALL GAME AFTER THAT. THANK YOU TO LIZ IN FINANCE AND JON BRUSS FOR THEIR CONTINUED PROFESSIONALISM AND KINDNESS. EVERYONE ELSE CAN KISS MY ASS! IM GIVING BAD REVIEWS EVERYWHERE! You have lost my service and my trust. You do not deserve a star let alone one! 😡<//review><gmap_id>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551< /gmap_id><username>Tiana James</username><Rating>1</Rating><resp>None<//resp></record>

We were mislead through the process. When we arrived they had none of our info stating that what we filled online only goes to corporate. We were told to come in any time before 8 pm on a Saturday, but once we got there and gave them our info for a second time, their finance companies were no longer open. They were supposed to call us the next morning but as of 330 pm Sunday, we have not heard anything from them. So we went from being told that several of their 100 finance companies will finance us, just come with proof of residency and income and we'll have you in and out in 1.5 hours with a car to spending a 1.5 hours in there getting no car and now no call from Paul Blanco.  To add insult to injury, I called them after I wrote this review and was told that The managers were busy and that I needed to call back.  For real I have to call back? OK!!!! As far as I'm concerned Paul Blanco falsely advertises what they can do for you. Never again!!!!< /Text>

<Text>We were mislead through the process. When we arrived they had none of our info stating that what we filled online only goes to corporate. We were told to come in any time before 8 pm on a Saturday, but once we got there and gave them our info for a second time, their finance companies were no longer open. They were supposed to call us the next morning but as of 330 pm Sunday, we have not heard anything from them. So we went from being told that several of their 100 finance companies will finance us, just come with proof of residency and income and we'll have you in and out in 1.5 hours with a car to spending a 1.5 hours in there getting no car and now no call from Paul Blanco.  To add insult to injury, I called them after I wrote this review and was told that The managers were busy and that I needed to call back.  For real I have to call back? OK!!!! As far as I'm concerned Paul Blanco falsely advertises what they can do for you. Never again!!!!</Text>< Pics>

<text>From the beginning the salesman didn't promise in the vehicle I was looking,but work with the bank,surprised I was approved on the spot without been around the bush,because my credit is low the down payment was a little higher but work out for me,at the end got what I like it no pressure Henry Williams was polite and courtesy spend over 4 hours fill out paper work so happy...</text>< Rating>

We came into Paul Blanco Norco feeling hopeless after having a terrible car buying experience in the past. We were immediately greeted by Xavier, who "promised to sell us a car that day", and he did!  We had a great car buying experience and drover away in a beautiful,  reliable car with low miles and we couldn't be happier with our purchase. Thank you, Xavier, and everyone at Paul Blanco Norco!!!  You guys do good things for good people!<//Text>

<Text>They advertise alot of false b.s. at "Paul Blancos" they claim a "senior gold program" to help seniors get into a car. I went there on a appt. where the gal on the phone assured me I was approved with my $1500 down payment. After arriving there and going thru the same process they came back telling me I need $3000 down. I explained I had already been approved before I came in with my $1500 down for a car. The sales rep and mngr basically told me that they don't have no cars right now for my bank approval. I wish they had not lied and made my daughter take a day off work to take me down there for nothing. Just to be lied to and not even a apology. Shame on them.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Javi and Jason were professional and friendly while pulling all types of strings to make sure I got the exact car I wanted! I didnt think I could qualify for a brand new car because Carmax and Nissan turned me down but Paul Blanco got me in a 2015 Chrysler. I am another very satisfied customer!< /Text>

I had a very positive experience going to Paul Blanco to purchase my vehicle. I would like to thank you too Joe Nieto for such a great experience. I told him what i was looking for and what issues i expected to have and they did what it took to get me financing. I left in the vehicle i wanted and needed and I didnt have to spend all day there. I would highly recommend  Paul Blanco and would happily return there for my next vehicle!!! Thanks again Joe.

<Review>I was asked to leave a review, I called before hand explained my situation and asked about down payments, they assured me everything would be good, so my first uber trip was $20, and then leaving unsatisfied I had to spend 26 on uber in peak hours to get home, when I could have just waited a few days to get the down payment enterprise requested and had a much more enjoyable experience<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>My husband and I came to Paul Blancos because our credit was, sadly, really bad. They worked with us and got us into a 2011 Dodge Avenger and we love it!!! They took our 2006 Suzuki Forenza that had rescently got into a fender bender and gave us 1500 towards our dodge! Unbelievable!!! That was more than it was worth!!! We had a great experience. So great we went back not to buy yet but for in a few months (tax season lol). We are expecting our fourth child so we need another vehicle with more seats! So we went to check out what they offered and all we need is 1,000 down!!! Which is amazing for us considering our credit is terrible! If you're thinking about getting into a new car come here!!! Ask for Charles Gonzales and sit back and let him work his magic for you! I promise you won't be disappointed!!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The only things are that he needs to let the customers feel welcome and to remember that they are here to buy a car.

Let me just say, i live at the northern most part of fontana. Paul blancos is a 40 minute drive on a good day. Bad day, the drive ends up being between and hour to 2 hrs.

Day 1-Sunday. I walk in around 10 am and within a few moments, Henry Smith, salesman, comes out of the offices to greet me in the lobby. We run all my documents and I find out I've been denied. No surprise there. So they ask for a cosigner to which I have one. So we run the information and after about 5 minutes of me waiting, someone else approaches me (short, older Hispanic male) and tells me that he has 2 lenders who may be willing to work with me. However, according to him, neither of the representatives are near a computer. At this point, it's 1 pm and I have to leave for work so both Henry and the older Hispanic male tell me they will give me a call by 6pm that night or by the next morning. 530pm hits and I haven't heard anything so I call them, leave a voice mail with my name and number and ask for a call back at THEIR earliest convenience.

DAY 2. MONDAY. Around 11 am, I call, get no answer and leave another message. I text Henry, the first salesman to begin my case, and he tells me just to go in. I respond by telling him that i would rather know beforehand as to whether or not I had been approved. He tells me he could go in the next day if I would be willing to wait. I tell him I can be at the dealer at 130.

DAY 3. TUESDAY. I get a text from Henry at 11 am. The text read " you are approved"  so 130 hits and I find myself in the lobby at Paul Blanco. I end up waiting a little more than 2 hours, the entire time, a few salesmen cracking jokes and speaking about me as if I weren't there.  Finally, Herbert comes up and tells me that Henry wasn't there and hadn't even notified them that I was going. If fact, it didn't seem like he even had any intention of him going in to help me. Herbert looks at my application and then tells me that I was approved but the ONLY way I would be able to leave with a car would be if my cosigner were to trade in one of HIS current cars. I told Herbert that Henry NEVER mentioned that to me not even when I applied a few days before. I asked to speak to the manager and the only thing me manager did was give me a number for a complaints department.

All in all, I drove a total of 2.5 hours there and back, wasted 2 hours waiting around, and then left without a car because of something that Henry never mentioned at all in the days that we had been texting. I would definitely never recommend coming here since the only helpful one was the receptionist. This place is a waste of time, energy, and gas..<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dcb0f1a98a65cd:0x4a7861bbe8dd2551</gmapID></record>

They are out to take advantage of anyone and everyone, VETERANS BEWARE. They promised me a 2.9 percent APR without running my credit. They are psychic too. Wow. Multi-Taskers.. Just stay far away from there. If you want a real deal, Browning Jeep/Chrysler in Norco. I got my vehicle down from 26,999.00 to 17,100 before taxes. No hidden fees. I was also given 0 percent APR and 0 down on my 2016 car. Also, I was out of there in one hour after I made the decision of which car or truck that I wanted. We went down to show it to the folks at Paul Blanco, and they acted like we had never been there that day. Paul Blanco should lose their business license for deceiving everyone that makes the mistake of stepping foot on their lot. I wouldn't buy a candy bar there. That is as kind as I can make this review. Sorry to everyone that was taken for a ride..I wish I could give them 1/2 star. That would be for the guy at least for shaking my hand before he tried his games on me.< /review>

<Review>I wanted to leave no stars but wont let you. They have horrible service. they have you make appointment, you go to your appointment then they leave you there waiting  almost an hour and a half then tell you wait longer leaving you there.  after days of Hound you with calls for days trying to get you to go in, and then just leave you hanging. worst experience ever, very unprofessional would never recommend Paul Blanco to anyone.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Worst customer service possible. Told me I was pre approved then drove and hour and half down there to find out I was approved for anything.

Took 4 hours just to see about getting approved . Told me all u need is co signer . Went through the trouble of getting one . Still didn’t get approved . Told me I have 21 days to come up with down payment then turns out they didnt wanna offer me that . I thought this company gives fresh starts doesn’t seem like it to me<//Review>

Was no help! Drove almost an hour to the nearest location (since they couldn’t give me the details over the phone) to only get told they aren’t able to help me with what I wanted but insisted on selling me a pile of junk that server zero purpose to what I needed! Sales people will be sales people I guess<//Text>

Was at the store for 3 hours and only saw one car. I went in with a specific purpose and they ignored it. I kept asking about pricing and what models they had on the lot and they picked the car for me without allowing me to see the cars on the lot. Needless to say I won’t be going back!< /Review>

This place is a joke it's funny how they try to put me in a little sonata or ugly Mitsubishi with a payment of 400 to almost 490 the guy who helped me was rude and I didn't like him so what if I'm a first time buyer or haven't build my  Credit so I went to a real dealership and got a 2015 Honda for way less with a 7 year warranty 0 miles and 200 a month on top of 500 down<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I bought a troka and I don't even have 1 month, and the mechanic charges me $ 900 to fix it.

(Original)
Compre una troka y no tengo ni 1 mes ya se chingo y el mecanico me cobra $900 por arreglarla.</review>
