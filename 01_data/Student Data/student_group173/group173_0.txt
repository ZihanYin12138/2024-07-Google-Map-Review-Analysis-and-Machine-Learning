I have always had an extreme fear of the dentist. But here, everyone is so incredibly nice and knowledgeable that it was difficult to have that fear take over. I am an unfortunate soul that usually has to undergo deep cleanings instead of the quick and easy cleanings, but it was not until coming here that I found out WHY, and have a treatment plan set to finally make cleanings less painful. On top of that, I was astounded to not be crushed with a massive bill for all the treatments. They make it really hard to fear a dentist visit when you can afford it and everyone there is so nice.</Text>

New location Aspen Dental in Hollister Ca.
I was pleased place was very clean even smelled great!
From the receptionist to the dental technician and doctor they all were friendly. Very top notch..
While visiting my mother for the holidays I experienced pain with an implant. Dentist was able to see me right away. Doctor took care of the pain and  all my dental needs. Would highly recommend Aspen Dental to everyone.

I’ve been here twice and both experiences were great. Friendly staff and great customer service. Everyone is very nice, welcoming and professional & they are very straight forward with your dental diagnosis and they definitely remove the fear of going to the dentist. They take extra precautions due to COVID and are very safe. They are a great environment!<//review>

< review>
So I have to admit that I have a completely irrational fear of all dental work, because of this I avoid the dentist at all cost. When I finally did eventually go to the dentist I chose aspen because of the good reviews. So I wanted to let other people who have extreme dentist anxiety that this is the place to go. This was the first time I’ve been to the dentist in 3+ years and I had so many issues with my teeth, but the whole aspen team was really comforting and super helpful. From the receptionist to the hygienist to the doctor, they were all very nice. They also were very attentive, I went in for a check up and they made time to give me xrays, cleaning, and filled two really bad cavities.
I still have so much more dental work to get done but I’m not nearly as nervous.
I highly recommend this office.<//review>

I absolutely recommend this dentist office. Dr.Ichhya Pathak Paudel and her staff are amazing.  I have had a lot of dental issues and have not been to the dentist in awhile  But when I came here all that changed they have help me on the a great dental health plan.  I am also doing invisiline with them and they have made it affordable and have worked with my insurance. This is the best dentist office I've been to. My experiences here have been nothing but stellar.</Text>

Office staff couldn't  tell f I needed  permission for xrays and exam.

The staff was friendly and competent, but getting money  was the main objective of this office.  I was quoted $7000. 00 for work that didn't need to be done.  I went to local family dentist and got what need doing done for $450. 00

Delicious Matcha Chai Latte!! I'm addicted. This location runs like a Swiss clock. Love the "mobile pick up" option too. So efficient, friendly and quick. Given (void of males behind the counter) it's women's month-  you ladies killed it!!<//Review>

Ordered Iced Green Tea Latte, Venti but got it almost half gone because of the foam. I guess I’ll have to start ordering it “with no foam?” But it shouldn’t have foam 😅<//Review>

<Review>I'm tired of wasting my money! ALL of the Starbucks locations that I have gotten coffee from, have seriously gone downhill in quality in the last few years! Their coffees now are almost devoid of coffee flavor unless you pay extra and add an espresso shot! I will from now on, go out of my way to get coffee from Peet's, Caribou Coffee etc. to get a quality cup of coffee, or do without!</Review>< pics>

Asked for a hot tea to be blended with ice. When I got the tea, the venti was only 3/4 full, lots of foam (?) And not blended with ice... but I understand it's covid time, so maybe not the best times to ask for special drinks to be made..< /text>

<user_name>C M< /user_name><time>1594765733284< /time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>I stopped by this location yesterday a little after 5 AM to get breakfast and coffee before my appointment across the road with Stanford Cancer Center. I commend the location and the early morning staff for strictly following proper social distancing measures. Although this review is not only meant to praise the cleanliness and the safety feeling it gives their  patrons but particularly about the young lady who greeted me at the door. All three staff had a pretty good system where one was the runner (the lady greeter), the second staff (male) was the dedicated barista for the day and the third staff (female) was manning the cash register and helping out at the kitchen. Obviously, customers weren’t allowed beyond the makeshift barrier they have provided as you enter the door. Unfortunately the cash register and the app scanner was understandably located in its original location which was behind the makeshift barrier.
So in order for my app to be scanned, the lady runner has to bring my phone over to the scanner.  The staff saw that I was not comfortable with the idea because I didn’t see the runner change gloves after she helped the customer before me. I was trying to explain why I was feeling uncomfortable and apologetic at the same time, telling them that I am an immuno compromised cancer patient. The lady cashier immediately dismissed me by saying that I can always go to another store. I got all flustered  because I was thinking I didn’t have my sani wipes available because I knew that I did not need to touch anything except for my order and I just wanted my coffee and breakfast.
The next scene is how I find the lady runner’s response highly commendable. After hearing about my condition, she immediately offered to wash her hands and change gloves to which my knee jerk response was, “yes please”. Without saying a word, she did oblige while the cashier was mumbling a comment to the barista and shaking her head.
At that moment I felt embarrassed because I realized she didn’t need to wash her hands, she just needed to change her plastic gloves and yet she went above and beyond what was expected of her. That’s great customer service right there! I wanted to go back and ask for her name but I didn’t want to give her the wrong impression. Obviously this lady was trained well and  was putting her professional training to good use. She remembers her core values and knew how to practice them as a means to de-escalate the situation. God bless her for doing such a great job and may she be recognized as a valuable employee of Starbucks!</Text>< Pictures>

Did you know that all of their team drinks are available without sugar? I had a lovely simple green tea with 0 calories :) I'm on a crazy sugar free diet these days :). This place is particularly good for small groups that need to have a meeting also.<//text>

Usually I wouldn't bother to review a Starbucks as they're all pretty much all the same. BUT this Starbucks would easily have to be the worst I've ever been to. The staff were uninformed about what size my drink cup was. The wireless chargers didn't work. and they never bothered to call my name at least not so that I could hear it so my drink set up there for a while before I decided to go check up on things and grab it.

I would recommend the Starbucks at the corner of Los Gatos Boulevard and Winchester over this place but they are closed for repairs at the moment.< /text>

It's Starbucks! No mystery here. This is a nice enough store located next to the freeway (CA-85) art the Los Gatos Blvd/Bascom exit (across Los Gatos Blvd from the Stanford/Good Sam hospital medical complex.

The partners are friendly and the customers are dominated by medical personnel who clearly frequent this store. This is a busy, well-run store which features a great location and inadequate parking.< /review>

< Review>
This is the closest Starbucks to my home, but I try to avoid it. First of all, it's on a busy corner and parking is a pain. There's more parking in a garage underneath the building, but it's inconvenient to access. The store itself is clean and well-kept, but the employees are always slow; even when I use mobile ordering it takes way too long to get in and out. The location down the street at Los Gatos and Blossom Hill is a better pick.</Review>

Very Convenient location right on Bascom. Staffs are friendly. Morning could be little hard to find parking space in front of the store but there are plenty of parking in the back.< /text>

<Review>I go between 3 and 4 stars in this place. I guess it is one of those places that it depends on what you order and who your server is.  They get everything else right, decor, menu, etc.

But the experience there seems to always come down to those 2 things.<//Review>< userid>

The place was jammed.  It was raining and the parking is totally innadiquate requiring me to park out back of the building in a mud parking field and walking clear around the building to enter this business.  Next time I will go to the store on N Santa Cruz Ave. when in the Los Gatos area.< /Text>

<review>Been their customer for 10+ years. Lately the quality has gone way down. Been using Mobile order for a while, for the last two days, they got wrong drinks for each order in a roll! For a normal latte, they have sticker on cup but add mint into it. The manager is not as capable for sure.< /review>< pics>

Not very client friendly.  Parking is very limited and only 20 minutes per parking stall. Once you get inside there is very very little seating. And the seating is not that comfortable. This is a very small location.< /review>

<text>Wow, what an experience for my daughter today. Being only one person is allowed in the room, the staff was very accommodating in letting my 9 year old to be with Tyson. My daughter felt so grown up. Dr. Brittany Neal was excellent, and took her time when conversing about our pup. I highly recommend this place for your furry family members.

<Text>Took my two cats to confirm if they were pregnant or not and the doctor couldn't figure out if there were even though she's a doctor and said we needed to pay for a tester for 190 each! So I declined because that is too expensive and then I later on over heard the nurses talking about my cats saying that they were pregnant, meaning that the doctor did know they were pregnant and was just trying to make us pay for nothing.</Text></record>

This place is really good. The staff is really nice. I came as a walk in they attended my dog very kindly. My dog had an infection caused by foxtail embedded into his skin the vet took him in to get it removed and cleaned his infection the same day. The initial price was around 500$ but they took off optional things my dog didn't really need which brought down the price to around 200$. I had a very good experience very nice people. My dog is good now his infection went away with the help of the medication they prescribed and he's back to his old energetic self. (Here's pictures of him in the vet and after he came back home from the vet)</text>

<Text>Brought dog in for injured eye and was informed that she may need to have it removed. Dr Neal offered alternate treatment that worked and my dog has both eyes still, not showing any signs of discomfort. The treatment was effective and less expensive than surgery. Support staff were also helpful, explaining details and providing phone reminders. Overall great experience.  The people seem to genuinely care about the animals, not just $$$.Thank you !!< /Text><user>115775251155895609005</user>< Rating>

<review>Staff and doctor were very friendly,came here for a second opinion and I was not disappointed. Appointments are necessary but make the visits easy and quick. My dog got the attention she needed and was taken care of asap, which I appreciated. All my questions were answered and explained. It was also a lot more affordable than other clinics. It was nice and clean which is a big deal. They give you options and let you know what you're paying for. This will be my new favorite clinic to take my senior dog.</review>< GmapID>

<text>Took my dog for first time, felt like the doctor could of advise the  best treatment for my dog with her experience my dog had a hematoma due to  ear infection, since I took him on saturday they have you pick which option do you want for treatment So picked the one they able to do on Saturday needle aspiration ,next day came back, fluid of blood was almost the same as when I took him, I think she knew she mentioned  it could possibility return, it return next day  paid about $340 and then she recommended doing minor Surgery $546 2nd procedure  it too expensive ,she would just best treatment only would of paid once.  Took my dog somewhere else the  vetinarian of coarse the hematoma and blood would come back that wasn't the best treatment to doWon't go there again .<//text><userid>103398259935794277263<//userid><gmap_id>0x80c2cb42eea12f0f:0xa307d8952c386b3</gmap_id>< resp>

Dr. Brittany Neal very much cares for these animals and their owners. Prices are still reasonable. And now they use technology (diagrams, data) to show more in depth the health of your animal after a blood test which is neat. The new design done to the hospital is refreshing.</Review>

<Review>A very beautiful experience I had, recently took in my dog in to be put down and they did not rush they did not push they did everything to help, usually animal clinic smell and look bad but not this place it smelled very nice and was very clean and nice. The staff was very nice and I don't think the price is to much actually they where cheaper then the other places I looked around, I'd recommend this place.< /Review>< pics>

Alameda Animal Hospital is a great local vet for small animals. The front waiting room is nice and clean. The front office staff are nice and friendly. In addition, the young vet doctor is very friendly and knowledge. She gives you great information about the animals healthcare. Furthermore, once you make appointment you with receive a text message reminder a day before your appointment, or will call you personally if need to reschedule appointment.</Text>

What a wonderful experience my Pomeranian and I had.  I didn’t have an appointment.  Not only did they make the time to examine my dog, they didn’t rush through the exam.  I’m so happy with the new staff.  I’ve been coming here for a little over 9 years.  Front desk staff is welcoming, friendly, and engaging.  This is important as it sets the tone for the visit.  The vet spent time asking very good questions about my dog during the examination.  She was very thorough, made a couple of suggestions but NEVER applied any pressure to take those recommendations.  In all the dozens of years I’ve taken my dogs to vets, this experience reigns supreme and I’m talking 40+ years of vet visits.  Thank you for patiently answering all my questions and for the stellar service you and your staff provided.  If you’re looking for a great vet, please give this place a try.  They know their stuff.  This was not the typical trip to the vet I’ve had many, many times before with my pets over the years.  This was an experience—I left with more education about nutrition, prevention, treatment and overall well being of my precious dog.  It’s nice to have people talk to you instead of shoving a metric butt ton of brochures in your face.  I don’t live nearby but it’s well worth the trip to receive excellent service.  Thank you.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Gibson was our vet for many years. He sold the practice and we were disappointed to lose him. We didn't know where to go our who we can trust with our dog's health. But our dog got so sick that we HAD to take her in. I called the vet and came in on a Wednesday and to my heart and pleasant surprise, Dr. Gibson opened the door and welcomed us!!! As it turns out, he works there one day a week (on Wednesdays). We were so happy to have our doctor back! My dog needed an operation to correct a  bladder problem and she is on the mend. I'm so happy Dr. Gibson is there. As for the management staff, I must say that Jason, who manages the front desk, is very good and nice. The young lady who took my cc info, misspelled my name on the bill, even though it's on the cc. But Jason made the necessary corrections and all is well again.< /review>< pics>

I've been taking my dog(s) here since their puphood and I can say I am satisfied with their service, friendliness and over all willing to help. My dog absolutely loves the people who saved him. Now one year ago  from now It's time to move on hence I moved else where, called to see if they could email me my dog's vaccinations and rabies certification, which was immediately sent.

As long as you communicate with them well you shouldn't have a problem. It's a pet clinic, they fight to save other people's pets everyday - it's not an easy job!<//Text>

Under new management. Their service has declined tremendously. I’ve been coming here for over 10 years. I’ve recommended several friends and family, some whom tried since the new management and decided to go elsewhere. It’s convenient for me so I’m trying to give the new management time to improve. The new admin and receptionist are not pet or customer friendly. I’m here now and called 3 times to finally get a response and appt. I will give it a few more visits and hope for improvement. Otherwise will have to look for a new vet.< /review>

AWFUL!! I have been a 15 year plus customer and used to like the service and vet. Used to recommend friends and family. Felt it was more about the pet and the former staff cared. The new management took over the service dropped tremendously. Even pre-covid they were hard to work with appointments. The vet is constantly not in or at long lunches. The staff is unprofessional. They won’t work with you. Want to send every dog to urgent care because they have no walk ins or same day appointments. I’m already looking for a different vet. Raised there prices by a large margin. They try to convince you to run unnecessary tests to get more money out of you. If you love you pet take him somewhere else.</review>

< review>
The staff at Alameda Hospital is AMAZING!  My mother and grandmother has gone there for years. After relocating from Houston my dog became very sick. She suffers from reoccurring UTI's and had been having some digestive issues. There was a new Dr. there named Dr. Brittany. she took such good care of my fur baby and helped me come up with a long term health plan to keep my dog stabilized.  The staff was very friendly and has since assisted me with any questions I have regarding my dog.  There is no greater feeling than someone taking good care of your pet and knowing you can trust them with your pet!
GREAT JOB GUYS, thank you for everything!<//review>

<review>Went there with my lil dog who was in bad condition. 15 mins before closing didnt know what time they closed- refused me service unless I paid an additional $100 for after hours.

I am so overwhelm with joy when I found this hospital,  the wait was 10 minutes top to be seen for the first time.  When I came in with my 8 week old cat my 16 yr old daughter crying and the cat having seizures uncontrollably it was heart wrenching to see the kitten suffer.  I had previously went to another animal care place that try to charge me $100 higher than Alameda hospital and a extra charge for medication which I could not afford.  Thank GOD for Alameda Animal hospital Dr. Thomas L. Gibson save my kitten life.  After the exam he knew exactly what was wrong.  The cost was very affordable, the lobby clean, the environment friendly and inviting.  I will be going back for more follow ups for my pet and would recommend you to do the same if you have pets.   My kitten name is Bunnie a.k.a Sea Buscuit she is recovering well, what a scare....</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cb42eea12f0f:0xa307d8952c386b3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This park has lots of space and and a variety of trails to run around on. Everything is fairly spread out rather than one big play structure. The easy climbing wall and rope pyramid are hits with my kids. The water-play feature is unique but the flow rate is a mere trickle. The lack of a dedicated parking lot is the only downside, and that assumes you are driving here.<//Review>

Nice walking path for people, dogs, bikes. Good bird watching opportunities.  Easy street parking. Decent bathroom up by children's play area was a blessing after our morning walk.<//Text>

Love everything about this park... other than a weird tendency for parents to not watch their kids.  Been here dozen times and each time I find myself having to police kids running amuck while parents chat among themselves.  Usually older kids (9-10 yrs old).  And I get that kids that age don't need to be hovered over, but they still need to be monitored.  Today there was a group of 6 girls all climbing in, over and on top of the tube slide... Almost kicking other kids in the face as they came down the slide.  They also left their shoes and socks all scattered around at the bottom of the slide, leaving other kids to trip all over them.  Their moms?  Sitting on the bench taking selfies.  I know there are parents at every park not paying attention, but speaking anecdotally, there seem to be more parents of older kids who are distracted a lot more (or for a longer period of time) than at other parks.  I imagine it's because it's more of a social gathering spot for the grownups too.  Regardless... it gets annoying after awhile.  Regardless of age -- parents need to keep an eye on their kids to make sure they're being responsible and respectful of others at the park.<//Text>

Over the last few years, Comcast has really upped its service game, especially at its store locations. They get you in & out of the store quickly and efficiently, and actually care that you are a happy customer! The service is a bit pricey (negotiate with them), but continually improving in features, speed and content. I love the DVR service and online streaming capability.<//review>

<text>There was a pretty long line outside the store about an hour before closing time but once we got in service was very quick. Have to give employees credit for working through these challenging times given limited historic capacity and distancing restrictions.<//text>< gmapID>

Representative here is kind and friendly. But the problem is the internet service. Xfinity internet service is really worse. You won't be able to get the download/upload speed as what said in your plan. And the uploading speed is a disaster. 1Gigabit plan with 35Mbps uploading rate? What a joke. And you when you upgrade to 1Gigabit plan but use the modem that you used for 600Mbps/15Mbps plan, suddenly you will get only 5Mbps uploading speed, then the representative will just tell you that your modem is not compatible with 1Gigabit plan, but cannot solve the problem for decreased uploading speed. After wasting 5 hours, I decided to change to AT&T fiber. Then I feel released.

If you read all comment, you should cancel Xfinity service ASAP, and just install AT&T fiber. You will know how s**ks Xfinity is.</text>

<Review>Xfinity  is the same old Comcast in a new wrapper.  Store personnel were somewhat knowledgeable but lacked the fine points of the Xfinity contract world. We returned one piece of equipment that was no longer needed.  Sceptical that just placing it in the return container would be enough, we actually handed the equipment to a person. That person told us just place it in the container.  We protested and a "manager" took the equipment inside the store. He came back with a receipt that said "equipment issued".  All of the Xfinity equipment was listed. The manager just said something like , the returned piece is now off of your account. Nowhere on the receipt does it state this.  When we got home, I called Xfinity. After all of the recorded BS, I spoke to a person that confirmed the equipment return. Xfinity needs clear, concise information it's receipt<//Review>< Name>

This is my personal experience, your mileage may vary.

Be careful with Xfinity or Comcast.....they lure you in with "specials" that expire and then prices jump up quickly.  Reps will promise deals or free stuff that they won't honor.  You can buy your own equipment and don't have to rent theirs which is very expensive.  They almost always overcharged me and when I called them on it, they wouldn't refund the overcharge.

An In Store rep here felt bad because Comcast had overcharge me and promised free content to offset the charges.  When it didn't show up as promised, I went back, she wasn't working that day so I asked for the manager.  The manager wouldn't come out, hid in back but told the rep I was dealing with they would not honor the commitment even though I had it in writing on the rep's business card.  Blew my mind and forever changed my opinion of Comcast...

In Comcasts defense, their internet only is OK as long as you only care about download speeds.  Their service for the most part is limited to much slower upload speeds, mine was capped at 12mbps with 150mbps download.  Before I switched to Sonic fiber which is $90/mo for 1gig up and down, I used Comcast internet and it worked.  I now only pay for internet and stream whatever services I need, i.e. youtubetv, netflix, youtube music, amazonprime etc.

If you have no other choice, Comcast is reliable if a bit confusing and expensive...just be careful.  Always review your statement to make sure you're not paying for something you didn't sign up for or are not being provided..... :-(<//Text>

<review>Just avoid all things Comcast if possible.
Hope you never have any billing issues.
I moved and cancelled with confirmation. About a month later I get a large bill (with late fee). Then I got to spend the afternoon on hold trying to correct it. I thought I was finished until they said I still had balance. Turns out they conveniently had a much later stop service date (save your emails folks). With that accepted, now I'm just waiting on a mailing to confirm everything is complete.

Good thing I didn't trust them with auto-pay.
Just avoid all things Comcast if possible.<//review>< rating>

The last visit I had there about 3 years ago was the worst customer service I've ever had.  They act like they don't care what your issues are because they have the upper hand at everything.  So just get what you need and get out of there.  You can do more research on your own.  Be prepare.  Hopefully by now they have better service.< /review>

It will be much faster and cheaper to handle everything online or by phone.
Came here to get new internet service and they wouldn't honor the online price. They said that at checkout, the online portal will change the price to what the store was offering. This obviously wasn't true since I was able to get the same service for 25% cheaper per month by doing it online.< /review>

My experience with Xfinity in general hasn't been satisfying as a customer whether on the phone or in person. It almost feels as if they intentionally want to give their customer a hard time and I'm positive that is the case. I was at the store to pickup an activation kit and they made me wait for half an hour just to hand me an activation kit after several attempts at trying to catch their attention when they weren't even busy. I still found a couple of the employees there who kindly tried to help which I appreciate. Thanks Brian!< /text>

The phone number goes to Comcast's general switchboard, not directly to any local store.  There is no way to call any Comcast local store.</review>

< Review>
This review is a few months overdue, which I sincerely apologize to Michael M. for. I came into the store hoping to repackage my previous 1-year bundle plan for a better price.
(To note, each time I come into this store I am warmly greeted and welcomed)
Michael was the first to help me. At first glance there was nothing really he could do for me in regards to a better package that suited my needs and was at a reasonable price. However, Michael took the time to keep looking until he found something for me at a price I walked away happy with. What's more, I also appreciated Michael taking the time to help me find routers that would be compatible with my new services. I had many questions and Michael never seem to be bothered by it; he also gave me his card so that I could reach out to him with any problems or concerns regarding my account.
I apologize for Michael for taking so long to write this review, but walking away from Xfinity that day made me not only appreciate his amazing customer service but happy to be a customer of Xfinity because there have been horrible cable service company's I have had to deal with and Xfinity has been nothing but great!
Thanks Michael!</Review>

Tyler L. and Alexis H. are the most AMAZING Xfinity employees at this store! I tried to upgrade to the Note 10+ for me and my husband, for two days straight we had an issue and I was refused an upgrade because I missed ONE security question (Soo frustrating!) Finally on the 3rd day Tyler went above and beyond to make sure I walked out with my new phone. It was ONLY because of him that me and my husband were willing to go in for a FOURTH day straight to upgrade his phone. Alexis was BEYOND sweet and understanding, and went out of her way to make sure my husband walked out with his new phone, we even bought two cases from her. We've been with Xfinity since 2016 and those two are the most AMAZING sales reps we have ever had the pleasure of working with.</Text>

I would have given 0 stars had there been an option. Please save yourself from these cheaters. I went in this store to get a new internet connection for my home. Serge helped us out. I was told there is a combo pack for 200mbps speed and 200 cable channels for $49.99. Since I saw no such package on their website, I literally asked him to confirm the speed. Everytime he said, he has checked and for sure it is 200mbps. I buy this package and after a few days, I see the internet is pretty slow. I check my account and this guy Serge sold me a combo 25mbps plus 25 cable channels for $49.99. this is absolute cheating. Even the package on their website which costs $49.99 gives 10mbps speed.
I would want the authorities to take strict action against these cheaters who they have employed.<//review>

Worst customer service. The sales persons are extremely unprofessional and are not focused on the customers. They also sent me around in circles and refused to reach out to their phone customer service, what kind of customer service is that? They did beyond the bare minimum. Definitely not going back. A phone representative from Portland was so much more helpful and helped resolve the issue-- and was friendly!!</text>

The rating is for the equipment/service provided:

The store itself is beautiful and is 5/5 stars.

I needed a wireless box because I got a new SmartTV for the living room and I moved the smaller non-smart TV to the bedroom(now too far away for a direct cable plug-in). Xfinity assured me they had a box for this. The box worked one day, and after THREE separate trips back and forth to the store... one issue was a box and the other two were remote problems... I'm not sure if there is a Quality Control process at all(if so, it's pitiful), but I finally decided to return the box instead of paying $120 additional a year to Xfinity (not to mention the headache of inadequately trained employees- there first instinct is to always offer someone come out... Do you think I have time to wait between 8-4? For the tech guy to show up ..?? ) and so I got a SmartTV with a Roku built in and I'll stream Xfinity for free. Thanks for nothing Xfinity, I was able to figure out my own problem.<//text>

They were careful in reviewing my quote and caught an error. The person that was helping me said "that looks a little high" and reviewed, then adjusted my bill to the as-advertised price. The experience: they weren't busy so they were talkative but not at all imposing.< /text>

<Review>Had us go back and fourth all day because the our self install kit was not working so we called and the representative told us we had the wrong box and that it's been discontinued and they wouldn't send a tech to fix our internet until we replace the box. The manager is very rude. I told him why we were here and he raised his voice at us. Spend your time else where. These guys are very unprofessional</Review>< time>

<Review>Which out even looking at the system, customer service representative at this location just told me that your annual internet contact is over and price went back to $66.95, "I have no other plans to get u below this price!".
Well, that was not accurate! I'm not sure if he lied to me or was lazy to check in the system or ...etc.

You guys at Comcast need to train your staff at this location,  cause I could simply renew my annual contact at the original price of $49.99 online for another year, which btw I just did after experiencing a bad attitude from customer service representative in this store.
Poor service..<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

Comcast really needs to review its customer service policies. I needed just to drop off the equipment, all changes to the account were already made on the phone with a rep. The same rep on the phone informed me that when I drop off the equipment I SHOULD get the receipt confirming that all equipment was returned because the returned equipment tends “to disappear” and then charged to the accounts. So I disconnected the equipment and came to the nearest store during my lunch break. At the store I was informed that I can drop off the equipment but if I need a receipt I have to wait for a rep to handle the receipt and stay in line for at least 20-30 minutes to do the drop off OR I was also told I can make an appointment to drop off the equipment (!). BUT if I want to drop off the equipment immediately then I can just leave it with the front desk with no confirmation of drop off!!!

Wait! Here is the question— why the same front desk cannot scan and print confirmation and reduce the wait time for customers who actually DO have issues to be resolved and concerns to be addressed!!! This approach absolutely does not make sense. I am sitting in a line with people who need 20-30 min to get answers, etc.

And here is the update: to drop off the equipment took 30 minutes. The actual scan and print of the confirmation, just as suspected earlier, was under 30 seconds!!!<//text>

One more excellent review of a great Tech, Victor T! He arrived early, was fast, efficient, and incredibly nice. We bombarded him with questions and conversation and he patiently handled it all and finished install in under 20 minutes. Even with our mangled wiring issues, he was able to get us up and running. He made my day :)</review>

<review>Really the worst customer service. The sales persons are extremely unprofessional and focussed just on selling without giving complete information. They are not aware of very basic information. For every question, they formed a group to discuss and provide me with the some random answer. For a faulty phone bought from xfinity, they force to visit to the manufacturer's store within their mentioned 14 days of buying and refuse to exchange.. Just wasted my whole time..</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fcaab7ca453e3:0xfa670238374f482b< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Went today at 10.30am. Not many people but all the reps were available. The rep who attended to me was very polite and handled my queries well. I had gone to turn in the Comcast modem and also downgrade my service to remove TV service and retain only Internet. The rep offered me with good plans which helped me to save a good amount of money, no hard selling to upgrade to stay with existing plans. Keep it up!!! This is a good location to get things done.</review>< pics>

Remodeled facade cannot hide its monopoly business model and how that affects their employees behavior to a captive public (not considered customer). No other utility company behave and get away as much as this business. Be prepare to lose a lot of personal time for nothing and lose tempers. It is advisable to use a magic 8 ball for more consistent answers than asking the same questions to different employees, in person or online.<//Text>

<review>No waiting time and I wasn’t harassed  to resubscribe. It was actually a very normal interaction. The store was clean and modern; temperature inside air-conditioned down to a chilly 65°: neither comfortable nor environmentally savvy - but I guess that‘s part of the corporate strategy to get people out faster. I‘m just sorry for the employees who can‘t leave.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The agent in store was cheating... The package he told me he ordered for me was different from what was actually ordered and placed in my account. I found out after my online account was setup that the internet I got was actually 60Mbps instead of what he told me in person 150Mbps.  I couldn't believe how a big provider like Xfinity can cheat on its customer like this. I'm very disappointed and now I need to cancel the Xfinity service.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Visited twice in two days - wanted to buy a phone. Store was empty except for 3 employees. Extremely rude and lazy staff, with no information about the product and promotions. They won't even let you touch the box of the phone that we wanted to buy, as if we would run off with it!!<//Text>

He arrived on time and called to let me know when he would be at my place.

He was friendly, professional and I was up and running with THE FASTEST internet service I've ever experienced in about 15 minutes.

This is without a doubt THE BEST service I've ever experienced with an ISP. I'm used to dealing with the big 3 in Canada... Xfinity Store by Comcast is leaps and bounds ahead of them.

Will be recommending to all my friends :)</Text>< pics>

Got there close to 9:30am on a Saturday and the place wasn't too busy. They have an easy to use check-in system and a monitor that will call your name when they are ready to service you. Friendly service. They do try to upsell but you can always decline or state that you are in a rush.</Review>

Terrible experience. I went there for a internet connection swap. They suggested that the old account holder cancel their service and I start a new account. The employee gave me what seems like a new router and sent me off saying everything I need to setup will be available in the app and process will take minutes. I came home only to realize the modem keeps on resetting and when I called customer service , they tried fixing issues for 2 hours on phone with no progress. Finally I am told to wait 2 days to get a service technician come to my house and manually reset the router. I will have no internet for two days now. I have a job that requires working from home after hours. This kind of crappy service bothers me a lot.<//Text>

I got a good surprise today.  My Comcast internet deal expires and the price went up to 50 %.  I negotiated a deal with online which is bundled with cable.  However, we seldom watch TV.

My colleague told me the Comcast might have different deal.   I went the San Jose one this Tuesday (1/10/17) and I got different deal without cable.  I like it and took it also that day.

Today(1/14/17), I went there again to return the unopened cable TV box due to my deal change.  I was surprised that there is NO record on my previous deal I made 4 days ago and I think I was day dreaming that day.

Feel disappointed and talk to the front desk manager (ID: WD5) as last try before  I plan to switch the different vendor.  Surprisingly he gave me a better deal and apologized for the confusion and inconvenience Comcast gave to me.  Really appreciate his help and kindness.

I was told Comcast service is a kind of chaotic and I somewhat agree.  However, from this manager's apology and deal, I would like to be Comcast customer to see how they improve the service.

Thanks again.</Text>

Just came by to pay my monthly bill. So you have 2 options, pay through their kiosk or be asssisted by an associate. Since the place was packed i used the kiosk. You can pay in cash but they don't give you change but they credit it to your account.<//review>

Nothing but problems...still waiting for the $285 refund they owe for putting me on the wrong mobile plan. They ONLY take payments straight from your account. Still not able to see a bill due to when I login it says I don't have an account. Took out 3 payments in 4 days for a total of over 400.00, yet I have to WAIT 5 days for a refund...guess my child shouldn't eat this week...
3 days during the month not able to text at all. Twice in month no service, their excuse was "well it shows your bill is due in two days, maybe that's why"..(although it's on auto pay...go figure)..
Do not recommend at all! Would give zero stars if available!</review>

<Review>I just changed it to 4 stars cause my recent visits of getting 3 Xfinity mobile services went very well. I have two BYOD phones and bought a cheap phone(moto G7 power) from them as well. All of them works like a charm. The moto G7 power is dam good. The battery can last me 3 whole days! And it have fast and sensitive finger print sensor. Their face recognition works which amazed me though the accuracy and speed is intermittent. To my surprise, Xfinity wifi hotspots are more than I think. And I get good coverage while hiking in the mountains. 7/23/19

10 month ago.
I want to call this store to ask about their cell phone plans since I am Xfinity internet user. What surprises me is that the phone number is a 1-800 number and I have to spend many time to answer the questions from a robot?! I don't understand why a human operated store needs a 1-800 number and a robot to answer customer phone calls! And the 1-800 number are the same for all of the Xfinity stores.< /Review>< pics>

Comcast has gone a long way to try and make their brick and mortar locations more efficient but they are only acceptable if you compare it to the nightmare that is their online/phone support. To be fair you are significantly more likely to get resolution from the store so it is definitely worthing coming here. This store has an automated check-in system where you type or answer the reason for your visit and then you are shown your position in the queue and called up once your number shows on the TV screen, and you are told what window to approach. Wait times have usually been relatively short no matter what time I come. Staff is usually disinterested but capable of getting most needs taken care of. If you receive equipment, make sure there aren't pieces missing because its definitely a problem.<//Review>

<Text>This store committed terms for a contract renewal, put them in writing, and then reneged, providing lame excuses.  Employees at this store treat customers with a sense of entitlement, and feel completely comfortable providing misleading information.  Typical behavior of a monopoly.  Comcast needs serious competition badly to get its act together.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Dishonesty, greed, and the worst customer service is what Comcast is known for.  They rely on people who don't check the bill and overpay because they're off of the promotion price.   I just wasted 2 hours of my life on the phone with 3 customer service reps and they all agree how greedy Comcast is.  Please avoid giving them any money.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

After explaining numerous times that I have my own DSL modem and I am returning an old modem, so please make sure you do not disable the wrong modem, the employee still went ahead and cancelled all modems on the account. Not only that when I called to re-activate, the next rep decided to run my credit for no reason and without even informing me!!! This is only one of my very many horrible experiences with Comcast this one just happened to involve the store...

I walked in to the front counter to tell the guy working at the greeting station that I needed a new remote as my sisters dog had chewed hers up. He sent me out the door with a brand new one no charge and a smile and was SOOOO polite and courteous he deserved a 5 star post here!!!< /review>

I want to give the no star if I could.
No one, I really mean no one in the store is trying to help customer, they are not helpful at all
I came their willing to transfer my acc to someone else, the stuff there making fun of other customers of ‘wired disconnection’ or ‘wired transfer’. The stuff are being very unresponsible.
If you want to do sigh up, think carefully, because they are not care any thing only you pay the money.

The x-fininity management make verything so inconvenient and complicate, we have to wait a day long to receive when they say the email has already be send out.  And we have to do all service via email, not even over the phone or in store.

Representatives say the same thing differently, I called earlier before I come to store,  representatives told me to come to any store for ID verification, when I come to store, they told me I have to do over the phone, when I call again, they told me I have to do everything by email.  Everyone is let customer to figure out a way.
If you ever think become new customer to them, think very carefully!! Neither the company and the stuff are professional. Very terrible experience I have.</text>

This is a good example of a company that has been outsourced.  Customer service has no clue what the the third party technicians do on the field.  They are under staff in their local sales offices (where you need help to return a box or get service).  They spend billions on acquisitions yet they can't  afford to hire a temporary help for $10 per hour at their offices.  On average you spend 2 hours or more just to get a cable TV box or switch a simple equipment. If you are lucky, you get the correct item the first time.  Just go to their 10th street office in San Jose, or the one in Saratoga Ave, and you can make your own reality TV show on how ridiculous and inefficient Comcast operates!!!....people need to start a class action lawsuit actions this terrible organization.<//text>

<Review>It was really a complicated experience. At the beginning, a comcast representative was so irresponsive that we decided to visit their local premise and over there we got everything (blast internet, tv and phone) and we were happy. then one week later we received another full set of equipments (router, setup box, etc.), i called them and was told no one would come to pick them up and i had to return them to their local premise. this was still acceptable, what IS really irritating is that later i can no longer access the xfinitywifi, this caused real inconveniences when i was in ces 2015, dozens of calls made, complaint email sent, so far this simple issue was not solved!<//Review>< UserId.>

Worse than DMV.. wait times are infinite.. staff keeps chatting with customers with no regards to wait times for those in queue. If you step out and they call your name, you lose your position in line and then again another hour of wait.< /Text>

I paid for wifi from xfinity, but it's  too slow.   Frequently it will not even open the web pages.  Trying to watch videos reminds of dial up  service from years ago.</review>

Awesome place. They are polite and patience. They serve you with a smile and not attitude.  They provide with options and wide range of price options to fit any budget and they explains things so you can understand the benefits of your choice.</text>

Cannot recommend this place enough. Cody was super knowledgeable and genuinely interested in getting me the best bang for the buck products for my situation.
I walked into the store and asked for help buying spearfishing gear, explaining that I know close to nothing about the sport. Cody spent no less than two hours with me explaining my options. He went above and beyond by providing tips for my new sport as well.<//Review>

Can't recommend this place enough. Their sales people were super knowledgeable and seemed to genuinely care about making sure I left with the gear that suited me best (I was wetsuit shopping...get it? 😂). You can tell they enjoy their jobs and working with the customers. Their onhand inventory is huge and I was glad that I had plenty of options when it came to picking a suit instead of only having just a few options in stock and me having to settle. Having "try on suits" was a great touch to make sure I could be sure about my wetsuit size without having to commit. Prices are the same if not better than online and you get the personal touch of knowledgeable staff to buy with confidence. Madison was particularly awesome to work with and was super patient as I flip flopped between sizes over and over again. Definitely swing by for your dive needs. Easiest 5 star review so far.<//review>

Did you know you can get your child as young as 10-years old PADI Open Water (Junior) Certified?  A really important question is: should you?

Certifying our son, who just turned 12, didn’t even occur to my wife and me until we finally booked that dream trip to Australia.  We booked a couple nights on a liveaboard on the Great Barrier Reef.  At first, we planned to just snorkel with him, “chase bubbles.”  Then we found that he could scuba with us.

We can, but should we?  Getting Open Water Certified in South California in Winter is not a trivial pursuit, especially for children who don’t spend a lot of time in the water.

We researched the local Certification Programs and decided that House of Scuba was the best fit for us.  Their staff was friendly and professional and their shop was well stocked from the value end to the “elite” end of the spectrum.

Kevin, the Shop Manager, was helpful in setting expectations.  We felt comfortable and ready.

Justin, our group’s Instructor, was without a doubt the best instructor you could hope for.  Certified at 10 or 12 (I forget), he is a True Believer.  More time in the water than out.  He still remembers what it was like to be certified as a child – the special challenges – since it wasn’t that long ago.  His demeanor with both the adults and the kids was perfect.  He is professional, extremely knowledgeable, highly-qualified and kept the dives very enjoyable, but properly focused.

So back to certifying your child.  There is a risk of your child not being comfortable with the non-tropical California conditions.  Your child might not be comfortable enough to meet the certification requirements?  Should you try, without knowing for sure if your child is capable?  The answer: yes.  House of Scuba’s staff and instructors know what they’re doing, understand the challenges for adults and children, and are very capable of finding solutions.

We had a short window to try to get all the dives in.  Conditions weren’t optimum. My son had little snorkeling experience.  He had some issues on his second Open Water check dive.

Kevin and Justin recommended finishing the dives with one-on-one instruction.  Having little time, I pushed to finish the dives on the following weekend.  Ocean Conditions were very rough, but the bay can be used as a backup, though visibility is often quite poor.  Though the staff recommended waiting for an Ocean Dive, Kevin and Justin accommodated our request.  This customer is NOT always right…

Our son just wasn’t comfortable in the bay, so we did not finish the dives.  This was his First Big Fail and it could have been emotionally catastrophic.  Our son’s disappointment was deep, but Justin’s professionalism, experience, delicacy and grace throughout the pool and Open Water dives really kept the experience a positive one.  Justin handled everything perfectly.

Back at the shop, everyone was very supportive.  It did not feel like a Fail.  Kevin was outstanding with the business side of things and we are arranging to complete the PADI Certification via Referral in the clear, warm, summer waters of the Great Barrier Reef.  Our son has very good instruction and some pretty substantial experience in far less comfortable conditions; I’m completely sure that he will be fine and complete his Certification there.

So, back to the question: “I’m not sure that my kid is capable of getting certified yet. Should we try?”  I say: yes!

There are a lot of factors that are beyond control; House of Scuba does a really good job with all the factors that are controllable.  They even were able to make our First Big Fail a Temporary Hiccup (and an excellent learning experience).

We’re disappointed that we did not get certified on schedule, but really happy that we tried and that we chose House of Scuba to help my son get started in this wonderful lifelong adventure.

Followup:  I attended my son's Certification Dives in Australia.  Even though it was two months since the Pool and Ocean Dives with Justin, it was clear that Justin did a great job teaching What, How, and Why.</Text>

I showed up on a friend's recommendation with only a vague idea of what I looking for with a million questions. Thankfully, Hannah and Cody were working that day and were more than willing to help me figure out exactly what gear I needed. I called a few days after to inquire about changing out an item and Kristen was super helpful on the phone as well! The staff was friendly and the selection was huge - I will definitely be back soon!<//Text>

Great shop.  I am not local, but called in hopes of getting a replacement strap for a my son's mask.  Cody was extremely helpful, and pleasant.  They had a strap that would fit and worked to send it to me quickly.  Rarely am I impressed with customer service these days, but this interaction was really excellent.  I may never need additional scuba equipment, and this shop is across the US from me, but I will certainly place orders here in the future if needed.  Highly reccomend if you want a real person, who really cares, and a quality product (at a great price).</Review>

Excellent Customer Service! Thank you all so much for getting my Apeks stainless steel backplate to me fast as requested! I purchase dive equipment all around and having a company that can have what I need in stock, properly package it, have it shipped as requested and answer their customers emails in a timely manner, is very rare these days. Thank you for the professional attention to detail!<//text>

< review>
Purchased a mask with "free shipping". Had to return the mask because it didn't fit properly and purchased another with "free shipping". Mind you, I had to pay the return shipment. I was only refunded a partial amount because I was told they had to recover the initial (free) shipping fee for the first mask plus restocking fee, even though I then purchased a proper fitting mask from them. Terrible way to do business.  If it weren't for the fact that customer "service" was timely, I would've only given them 1 star.</review>

<review>Overall just an okay experience.

Paid almost $200 for a night dive, which I would never complain about...only I was told on the phone that I was responsible for printing out 2 waivers, and that they couldn't do it there.

Also, it cost an extra fee if I wanted to have my gear brought out to the dive site.  I was scratching my head to figure out what exactly the $200 covered.

Ken, on the other hand, was a phenomenal guide, very knowledgeable, and I felt very secure diving with him on the night dive; he knew what he was doing. On top of that, though he didn't have to, he offered to take my stuff back to the shop, so I wouldn't have to worry about it. Awesome guide, you'll be in good hands.< /review>< pics>

First pair of sunglasses broke within a day. Replacement pair never received. No refund. I purchased a pair of sunglasses online at houseofscuba.com. After purchasing I was informed the glasses were out of stock so they sent me a different pair. Received those glasses and they broke within a day. I paid HouseOfScuba more money for a different pair of sunglasses, and then I never received those sunglasses. I have complained to House of Scuba and they won't resend the glasses, or refund my money.

Update as of 3/8/21: I have never heard back from House of Scuba regarding additional details of the first or the second USPS inquiry. I only learned of the second USPS inquiry via the response to this review. I filed a complaint with the BBB a while ago and despite repeated attempts by BBB, House of Scuba never responded to BBB. It was Sept. 2020 that I first purchased the glasses that broke, paid more for upgraded glasses that I never received, and have been simply trying to get the sunglasses I paid for. 6 months!<//Text>

Bought an Aria Full Face Snorkel and a SharkBanz for my boy about a month ago.  Store was welcoming and the staff was cool.  Lots to see and play with, EVERYTHING you'll need underwater, and plenty of stuff for noobs like myself.  I'm very happy with my purchases.   Thanks House of Scuba.</Text>

<review>Excellent customer service. They have more on their website than you will see when you walk in the store, so they have a lot in the back that they can bring out to you if you cruise their website beforehand and know what you are looking for. They are also very knowledgeable and helpful if you are unsure about what you want. And they price match from other reputable dealers, so that's a plus. Great team, great shop, great vibes.< /review>< time>

I have only got great things to say about House of Scuba, I am a British backpacker who while in San Diego on a layover needed to purchase some dive equipment before starting a job. I visited a few dive shops in the area and found House of Scuba to be the most competitive in terms of price, stock and used scuba equipment. Trinity and Keana were so knowledgeable, helpful and enthusiastic while I was choosing which made the whole experience a pleasure. Would highly recommend and if I am ever back in town I will be sure to visit again. Thanks! James</review>

My absolute favorite dive shop in San Diego!  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  They happily spend as much time as needed to help divers make the best choices for each person's needs.  Steve is a particular favorite.  Generous return policy including 30 day return for store credit if you have tried some equipment out and decide it's not right for you. (60 day return for full refund for items that have not been used).  That makes it much less stressful when making a large purchase.  Thanks to everyone there!< /Text>

<user>109948696041591021572</user><review>Wont be going back. Rented scuba gear here and it took about an hour and a half for the staff to put together three sets of scuba gear. They failed to mention that their fins we're not included in the scuba package, which cost an extra $20/pp. Had we known this we would have just used our own but by the time our gear was all put together we just wanted to get out of there so we paid the extra charge. Not upset by the price--just unclear advertising online and in the shop. I called ahead and was told that diving conditions were "ideal" that day. They definitely we're not. When we got out there the visibility was about 3-4ft. We also didn't have enough weight to dive at all--be fair on this point, it was our first time diving in 7mm suits so we didn't know how much weight we would need. When we returned our gear they realized that they hadn't sent us out with enough weight and offered a free rental package in the future. Nice gesture but we won't be back and it won't fix a wasted day of vacation.<//review>< username>

{'time': 1566591317488, 'text': 'Chris, I am sorry that your experience with us was not to the standard that you expect, and we will certainly look into the descriptions of our rental packages in the future. Having spoken to our team, it appears that you were allocated the standard weight package of 28 pounds and two of you were given and extra 10 pounds each. 38 pounds is generally sufficient weight for a diver as we generally assess 10% of you body weight plus 6 to 8 lbs, this weight would work for a 300 pound diver. It can be the case that with divers not familiar with cold water diving, 7mill suits, hoods and gloves and low visibility that it becomes more difficult to control breathing and in turn buoyancy when diving. The dive conditions in San Diego do vary and on the day of your dive the San Diego Lifeguard report said that the dive conditions were good, this is our reference for condition reports. We are sorry that your experience was not what you expected and we hope that you dive again in San Diego.'}</Response>

On-line buyer beware!!  My experience with House of Scuba was purchasing snorkeling masks on-line.  I ordered three masks to try on to find the best fit.  My order qualified for FREE shipping.  Beware, it is only free shipping if you do not return anything.  I found this out when my refund did not match my purchase price.  When I first read the return policy, I saw this -  If it is within 60 days and the items are in new condition with original packaging, there is a 100% credit or refund available on any item.  This led me to believe I would receive a full refund.  But wait, there's more...in the paragraph above it states you will be charged for the amount of free shipping you were originally given on your order.  So in reality it is not FREE shipping after all.  On-line purchasers be aware of this fact.  If I had realized it, I would have chosen to take my business to another website.  After I protested they offered a store credit but that is of no use since I will take my business elsewhere.</Text>

<Review>I was on a business trip to San Diego and wanted to see BCDs in person as I was looking at a lot of different packages online. Marcelo is the bomb - he knew so much about the stock and was able to help me pick out a great bcd package. Unfortunately, their packages as listed online are deceptive. I told Marcelo I wanted to buy everything at once and he told me I could save a lot of money by buying a package. I confirmed verbally several times the package would have everything I needed. We specifically looked at gauges because he said the only thing not included was the gauge.  I bought online because to use PayPal in the store would have been a delay. What I didn’t observe was that the octopus “option” was not an optional upgrade but rather a question of to Octo or not to Octo. I paid for everything on a Wed night thinking I could get the package pretty quick. First, they didn’t have the regulators advertised in the package. Then they didn’t have the gauges (which were supposed to be the only thing not included in the package). Then, the replacements for the discontinued items had to be shipped to San Diego. They did “upgrade” several items because they didn’t have the real items that are supposed to come in the package, but that package is still on the website. Later, I was told everything was being assembled. So, it took about a week for “everything” to be ready to ship. I travel a LOT for work; this weekend will be the only weekend I’m home to go diving between July 4th and Thanksgiving. Paid an extra $45 to get it by today. Everything came not assembled. Spoke with a manager named Kevin who explained that since I hadn’t taken the Octo “option” that meant I hadn’t bought an octopus at all. That would have definitely have changed whether I bought this package or not from this store. I can find a package with this BCD and two stage regulator on Amazon for about $800 as opposed to over $1100. Now they will give me a credit so a local dive shop can assemble everything. So basically I paid extra delivery for nothing and bought a package that is turning out to be WAY more expensive than anticipated. I think if you can go to the store and work with Marcelo and you’re just really careful about what the agreement is, this is probably a decent store if you live in San Diego. I think if you’re shopping online, I’ve seen WAY cheaper packages than the one I bought that would have come quicker with less hassle. I most likely will not do business with them again. I really wanted to go diving this weekend and I really didn’t expect to have to drop another $500+ after paying over $2k just to get all the basic equipment I need (to be fair, that’s for 2 kits, although one came with a bag etc the other looks like it might have been a demo or something). Not a happy customer at this time.<//Review>< pics>

House of Scuba is the best scuba store in San Diego. I just got back from a trip with them to La Paz. They kept us all safe and happy and really cared about us. Mike and Jamie led this trip and never disappointed anyone. Erin at the shop is very helpful in setting-up these trips and great at customer service. They will treat you as people and not just a customer because they care. Thank you for all you do, James B.< /Text>

If you are looking for a scuba shop that has amazingly friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful staff, look no further than the House of Scuba!  Everyone was amazing!  Shannon helped me pick out gear to rent for our dive in La Jolla Cove and she was efficient and kind. Kevin helped us get one of our personal tanks inspected and a valve replaced on it overnight so that we were able to make our second dive over our short vacation.  They were both amazing and so caring.

We waited for our tanks to get refilled the second day and we had no less than three other employees asked if we had already been helped, which we had.  Everyone had helpful tips and suggestions for our local dive and were more than willing to chat while we waited.  Best of all, we got to meet both owners of the shop and spoke extensively with one, Jason.  He was so helpful and pointed out some of the sea life we’d likely encounter on our dives in La Jolla.  He really took the time to get to know us and see that our needs were met while in his shop.  This shop gets an A+ in customer service and I highly recommend it!<//Text>

< Review>
Went into House of Scuba this week, brand new to diving and with not much experience.  Charles was working the front room, and he helped me and walked me through everything I needed to know.  He got me enrolled in the class, helped me pick out gear that worked best for me (not just the most expensive stuff!) and gave me alot of tips along the way.  Also, their dive instructor has been great to work with thus far.  I definitely recommend this place!</Review>

< Review>
Came here because of the reviews, and I was not disappointed.

House of Scuba is pretty much everything I want in a store/rental place. The staff are very knowledgable and helpful, they carry a wide variety if equipment, and the prices are reasonable.

A friend and I rented snorkeling gear here, and I wound up buying my own set. I was patiently walked through mask fitting options, different types of fins and booties, and was able to find one that worked perfectly for me. When one of the masks didn't work as planned, they were extremely helpful in getting me a new one that fit properly and wouldn't leak.

Overall I was very satisfied with the level of service and friendliness with everyone there. I plan to come back here for my rentals and wetware in the future.< /Review>

<review>Just a quick review.  I stopped in yesterday to look at the Scuba Gear.  The girls working in the shop were very helpful and the company instructor (I think his name was Tim) even came out with a few other BCD's for me to try on.  They didn't have what I was looking for but still were helpful and informative.  I was surprised they didn't get a higher rating on here.</review>< Rate>

Ok this place is great because they have sooooo much in stock. If you need a wetsuit and have had troubles in the past they will find one that fits! Extremely knowledgeable of the products! I had to try on 5 different wetsuits until I found the perfect one for my body type...you can't do this kind of thing online. Amazing results - had everything I needed! Thanks guys!</review>

I called House of Scuba and spoke to an awesome customer service department!! I sent the knife back and had a replacement in a very short time.  Yes I know most companies will do this, but during the process we were called personnaly and kept up to date on our replacement, lets see others do that!
Thank you House of Scuba, you guys rock!!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I purchased this watch: "Blue Freestyle Betty Shark X Sports Watch Ladies Womens Surfing Diving Surf Surfer Waterproof Divers Dive Swim Swimmers Swimming Watch Authorized Dealer Full Warranty"

No where in the online details did it say: NOT TO BE WORN IN SHOWER. If I had known, I would NOT have purchased it.

I admit I did not read every fine detail of every paper that it came with, but I did read the directions on how to set the date and time, the basics. Ended up taking it in the shower with me.

Made the mistake of admitting that taking it in the shower caused it to fog up and was unreadable. It had also happened when I went to the beach and while I was washing dishes. So in general, this watch is too sensitive to the head and humidity. But now my WARRANTY is VOIDED.

The correspondence was prompt but NOT concerned with keeping their customer happy. The only thing they offered was to send me this "waterproof" watch back... with me paying shipping AGAIN!

I'M NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY OR FREESTYLE... shady descriptions that entice but very poor quality. I've purchased cheaper watches from Wal-Mart before that didn't fog up so easily.</text>

Purchased a quick draw pony mount, arrived incomplete. They did not know the way the product works and could provide no assistance in how to mount. Instructions which came with item where very difficult to read, ie looked like it had been copied many times so the print and photos were illegiable. No cam belt or rubber patch provided, both of which are required for mounting of pony. Worse unable to find the rubber patch on their website.<//Review>

I ordered a bunch of stuff at my size shoe and one pair of boots didn't fit - I had to pay for shipping costs both ways to get the next size up because their suppliers can say a size 10 shoe is whatever size they want it to be. Online retailers should demand standardized sizing or pay the return costs when stuff that should fit doesn't.< /text>

Very unethical distributor!  An order was placed, the item shipped was not correct.  This should have been no big deal. After calling and speaking with them, I received an email counter to that stating they would not stand behind their error.  My credit card company provided a refund but this shop did not.  Save yourself the trouble.< /Review>

<review>i had a limited amount of time in the San Diego area and I had never snorkeled before. House of Scuba (HoS) said it was no problem and was able to get me scheduled very quickly. I went in to the store after meetings to get fitted and the next day i met my instructor (Jake) at the Children's pool in La Jolla.

He took me through the basics and was quickly able to put me at ease. After a few times in the water i was practicing diving and going further out as my confidence in myself and my instructor increased.

On top of that, Jake took some awesome footage using my GoPro session.

Overall a great experience. If I am in the area again I will definitely look up HoS.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I go this laundry mat often since it closest. I go at night usually to run my nitro rc in the empty parking lot. Never had issues. You get your share of weirdos here n there but security has improved on managing that over time. Plenty room sit kids down n free wifi till 11 i believe. Plus you go during store hours plenty to do to pass time with local market a skip n hop away.  They got vending machines but also a little market for gallons of soap etc. Overall ok if you got lil thug in you. Lol< /text>

Horrible place to do laundry. First the machine broke down and the person that supervised the place did not do anything about it just keep saying to let it run till the cycle ends, but it never did. Then another guy had to come open the machine to take my clothes out
and didn’t even return my money. This place steals from you if you let it.< /Review>

A small laundromat but cozy. All amenities you need under one roof. Plenty of parking. The Caretaker Ladies Are Very Nice & Cool. Highly Recommend This Joint. 😎👍< /text>

<Text>Was putting off the review on this place its a nice place ever since the remolding even has ample parking as well as snack & laundromat supplies machines apart from a new lil corner mart that sells supplies. However the customer service leaves alot to be desired, now on to to the equipment. By now its simply blatant disregard of proper maintenance and upkeep of most machines of the 3 loads an under, they have this smell to it (you can tell in some machines right away) however those which you can't end up leaving this persistent lingering smell which didnt come off easily< /Text>< Date>

Humid like no body's business. Half arsed wash jobs unless you use the $4 machines. Semi affordable laundry products. This place got me through the worst of times so I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The washing machine only took out hot water and I put it in cold! Check the water temperature. It can damage dark clothes. Garbage from washing machines always comes out hot water when you put it in cold

(Translated by Google) Lately the service at night I did not like very much they cover the machines to a yes there are too many people,
And the last experience (TODAY, AUGUST 22, 2020) they told me that if I was in a hurry I should go to another laundry,
instead of leaving the covered ones to wear,

I HOPE THE SERVICE WILL BE SOLVED SOON BEFORE LOSS OF MORE CUSTOMERS.

Última mente el sérvicio por la noche no me a gustado mucho tapan las máquinas a un si ay demasiada gente,
Y la última experiencia ( HOY 22 DE AGOSTO 2020 )me dijeron que si tenía mucha prisa me fuera a otra lavandería,
en vez de dejar usar las tapadas,

ESPERO SOLUCIONEN PRONTO EL SERVICIO ANTES DE PERDIDAS DE MAS CLIENTELA.<//review>

Previously I needed to get air in my tire twice and both times they were spot on with the help they gave me. They get what good customer service is all about.<//text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>I took my Subaru 2015 to change the rear brakes, the owner(the old Asian guy) isn't too friendly to begin with, anyways since those cars have electronic emergency brake, you need a software to disengage the brakes, and the man hooked it with electronically device and able to access the brake mode, but after 40 minutes he called me and told me all the alarm signals are on and he doesn't like anything to do with the vehicle. I told him that the signals weren't on when I left it, it must be the program screwed up, he insisted he did nothing. Anyways I had to call a tow and took it to the dealer, who charged me $189 just to turn off the signals and told me that the man accessed the brake mode and didn't know how to turn it off. Finally if you have electronic emergency braked vehicle I wouldn't recommend there unless you want to pay the dealer unnecessarily, and get it fixed somewhere else. The guy who works on the windshields is however very decent and professional, he fixed my scratch for free and without me asking him to do it.<//review><gmapID>0x80857df97ae427b7:0x9585a29c902439cd</gmapID><Rate>2<//Rate><user_id>110096380538662582027</user_id><Response>None< /Response></record>

This man is so disgusting dishonest (Art) he will befriend you like he really cares about your car. All the time riping you off. He is another one of those mechanics  who will fix your car but leave no oil  in your car. When you bring it back oh DID IT OVER HEAT? If you care about you car DO NOT LET ART TOUCH IT!!!<//Review>

<review>I called to ask if their smog station was STAR certified because I need to get my car smogged at a STAR certified station to renew my registration and the person who answered the phone hung up. He didn’t answer me, just hung up. My neighbor recommended this place for smog service, but didn’t know if they were STAR certified. I’ll look for another place.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1576140103455, 'text': 'Sorry for the inconvenience\nWe still trying to get the star back!'}</Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
I have been going to this gas station for I want to say about 10 years I met a & P Valero when I needed a mechanic for my Honda got my Honda working great then I got a Buick LeSabre that just would not start I mean totally would not start it needed a whole new transmission so got a new transmission in there my Buick LeSabre still runs great to this day it's been about 6 years we ran it to Sacramento and back and it is fabulous now he is working on my black 2002 Volvo he is doing an overhaul on the engine for me and I have never had any new problems once it's done and I thought he was very reasonable the owner is really nice too and comes out to greet everybody<//Review>

I went in to purchase a wig that will fit since I have locs. The owner was very helpful and kind. She helped me find what I was looking for. Also I was able to try on some wigs unlike these other stores. The wigs are good quality too. I will definitely be going back.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbII6elhTNDDAQ0Yc62rg0RuMRRbLQK9nVjkj5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

What a gem this place is! I went to a couple of other hair supplies in the area and was less than impressed with their selection and underwhelmed by the sub-standard customer service. Kim at Nefertiti was extremely knowledgeable and professional.  Her selection of hair and hair care products was huge. She was very helpful and guided me to choose the right type and color of twists for mu upcoming appointment.  I highly recommend you make Nefertiti your supply of choice as I have!< /review>

<text>Called and got an appointment right away. The location is close. Jasmine was very quick, only took 5 hours to finish. The only issue I have is the hair she recommended was NOT what I wanted. I wanted Marley braids so she asked me to buy Marley hair. I was confused because the pictures I saw was not the texture I wanted. She said it would match my hair better. It doesn’t. It’s itchy and feels cheap and my hair does not blend at all. The hair cost me another $40. Next time, I will use the hair I want. Especially when I am paying $300 for a style.<//text>< Pictures>

Thanks for assigning Jenny to do my facial! I like her because she was so friendly and professional in doing her work. I can say that she is one of your best beauty therapists. She proved to me that your beauty shop is one of the best here in our region. I was so surprised when Jenny finished the assigned session immediately. You are strongly recommended!< /Review>

Lawonna does such a great job with my hair. My dreads started off really short and within 6-months Ive seen exponential growth. The staff here is friendly and very welcoming.</review>

This is the shop I've been looking for! Knowledgeable,friendly and a fair price. Most of the maintenance I can do myself, but there's some things I leave to the experts especially when it comes to safety.< /text>

Susie and team were fantastic! I went in for an electrical problem; my tail light was not working properly. In no time, they had it diagnosed and recommended repair options. They were professional, gave great information and even saved the old parts to show me what was the source of the issue. I will definitely be back, should I need any maintenance or Harley repairs in the future. Thank you!< /Text>

DO NOT USE THIS PLACE.
OIL CHANGE NOT DONE CORRECTLY.
Bike is leaking oil even after I brought it back to them to fix. I have lost confidence in this shop. Their solution in how to diagnose what was wrong made no sense. There was no reasoning and no giving back any portion of my money. So now I will take my bike to a real shop. That’s what I get for trusting a low budget shop.
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.</Review>

Dropped of my wheel to get a tire change and couldn't have been more satisfied with their service. Staff was super friendly and explained all their tasks and they worked super fast, even on a busy Saturday. My wheel was done in less than 2 hours. I highly recommend!</Review>

Being an avid Hyper Bike rider in the Bay area, it's my pleasure to write a review that reflects the love I have for these people. Have over 20 years with these folks. They've truly become Family to me.. and never seems strange to me that when talking about the place to someone, that,  over and over, I'll hear " Oh Hell yea, I know the place". It's a rewarding feeling to know that the people I'm out doing my own "High Speed Ballet" with are involved with the same folks that are working on their bikes, as well as my bikes!. Wouldnt take a chance on anyone else's quality of workmanship. 5 stars doesnt seem like enough when you talk about Precision tune! At least for me!! They are awesome.< /text>

<Review>Brought my bike in for a full service (the service interval where you have to change EVERYTHING) and a rear tire. Great service, friendly staff, and quick turnaround. A nice change after dealing with poor dealership service department. I wish I had found this shop sooner. Bike runs, looks, and sounds like new! Very happy!< /Review>< pictures>

These guys are great!  My battery toasted my connections on the freeway a few miles north of here.  Gave them a call, the staff said they could take it that day, so I pushed that sucker in.  They immediately took it and it was fixed in a timely manner.  Highly recommended.<//text>

<review>Beware of this place...
Took my bike in for full service at 15000 miles they only changed the fluids “if they actually did” and replaced a 9/16 bolt that they claimed it was loose for $818.16 and giving me a false report that the brakes were good at 70%. A month later my brake pad was grinding on the rotor which eventually damaged it and also put me at risque.
When I complained they said it’s a wear and tear! They came up with all kinds of excuses that have no basis to wash their hands off. And they wanted to charge me more to repair their lack of liability and negligence.
I would not recommend this place to any follow riders. Ride safe and don’t trust this place.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1604117430819, 'text': 'Sir, we had to take a restraining order out on you for breaking into our shop, coming in and screaming at staff.

< Review>
After trying out several repair shops, this is undoubtedly my favorite. Competent mechanic work. Up-front and fair prices. I've taken bikes to them several times and they spend extra time explaining what's wrong and what they fixed etc... They routinely do little "extra" things to my bike and don't charge me. The place is usually busy, but if you have an urgent situation they can get things done quickly for your. I live close by, but even if I didn't I would make an effort to go to this place.< /Review>

< review>
I recently bought a used Ninja 250r and it quickly got a flat tire. I had it towed to Berkeley Performance Motorcycle for new tires; since it was in the shop anyway, I went ahead and requested a carb clean because it had some issues starting up and would stumble quite a bit after it warmed up -- I just suspected that it was a carb-related issue. Within the next couple business days, Carra contacted me via phone and text to let me know that the tires were put on and that the carb was actually in good condition and needed no work. It turned out that the issue was attributable to some leftover bad gas (an oversight on my part). Carra further informed me of a couple other minor issues that she could take care of, but didn't do anything without my permission. I was impressed by the shop's integrity and would definitely recommend utilizing the services offered.< /review>

Never leaked a drop till that day. They refused to fix it and now I am stuck with an unsafe motorcycle. They suck< /Review><Time>1512075106573<//Time>< gmap_id>

Maintenance quality is average (they do basic job but don't have time to check things. I got ticking sound from the engine and they told me it is ok. But I know now that this is one of valves getting stuck).
Main problem is constant delays - you cannot get your motorcycle back quickly. Even the smallest service will take at least a day because they cannot garantee that they will start working on it. And if something more complicated - you can wait for weeks. I started to maintain my motorcycle myself to avoid these guys as I used my motorcycle to commute to work and cannot afford to leave it for days.<//text>

I used to do my own work but due to issues with my hands I can't anymore... the idea of taking my bike to the shop made me feel like a total loser AND there's the whole trusting a mechanic to do it right (and listen to me... there are some out there who don't take female riders seriously).

Well, a friend of mine saw my lamenting on Facebook and recommended this shop... I've since taken my ZRX here several times and they've always taken good care of my bike.

I can't comment on the cost being fair or not because I'm unfamiliar any other shop costs. I hate spending the money but I feel comfortable doing so here because the work is done right so it seems worthwhile to me.< /review>

If you have a motorcycle repair issue that doesn't need the dealership key code Berkeley Performance is an excellent place to get professional repairs at fraction of the cost.<//text>

Got my tire patched, they didn't tighten the wheel all the way back on, ended up getting a chain falling off the rails while I was city riding.

Im sure the other ppl here had great reviews.

I will never take my bike back here again. Cant risk them forgetting something major like that.

go to berkeley yamaha,<//review>

The worst service I ever got in a shop. It took very long and the lady at the front desk was very rood, impatient, and didn't give me any information about the situation of my bike. I do not trust them at all. My experience as their customer was very unpleasant and I will never take my bike to this shop again.< /Text>

Ordered a daybed online and very satisfied. The price was so competitive that I was skeptical at first. I called the store and the rep was very nice and helped me check if it was in stock. Then I proceeded with ordering on their website and it was very easy. The daybed arrived in a few days and the delivery guys even brought it up to our second floor patio. Very happy! Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>Aetna Furniture store is the best place to buy furniture. Alejandro and Artem set up the furniture and did a wonderful job at it.

Bought a dining room and sectional, not great quality. We have 15 days and the items look like we had them for about a year now. The table can scratch and the paint is bad. I contacted them and they just gave me a credit for the table, the paint on the dining table is very bad. One of the chair has a rip on the cushion. The sectional the long part moves and is longer than the leg and the cushion is cheap. When delivered they didn't even tighten the chairs and still has plastic under.<//Text>

Wow, prices are amazing! Large showroom many different options for those on a budget. When I went I was looking at sectionals and couches for a new apartment. While checking the furniture out a male worker came over and started showing me how different sectionals converted into sleepers. He was very helpful and I appreciated his willingness to show me the functionality of different pieces I was interested in purchasing. He was a lot more knowledgeable than the female European sales person sitting at a desk. The female didn't even know that the store sold adjustable bed frames when I inquired about the beds. I had to correct her and inform her that the store sold more than mattresses. If you go, I'd see if the middle aged Spanish man is available. He can help you with the functions available with the furniture and won't make you feel stupid for asking questions. I'd recommend that you check it out yourself and get blown away with the prices. Happy furniture hunting...< /text>

This trip to LA was absolutely absurd.  I made sure to call and inquire about the items that we wanted to purchase. I asked several times if they were in stock. I was told yes they were and we could purchase at the store and pick them up as well. Well, my husband and I drove 50 miles to LA for NOTHING. We were told by the saleswoman that such items needed to be ordered online and the items would be delivered.  Such a disappointment.</Text>

Recently purchased a 6 pc dining set from them. Delivery date was earlier than expected; Delivery time was also spot on. Thanks to Alex and Dinar for being kind enough to drop the furniture inside despite the large number of stairs. Would definitely consider buying from them again.<//text>

This is my second time here and I highly recommend it. They are very professional and so helpful. They don't try to oversell you which I found a lot of places do. One stop shop for your mattress and headboard. Don't go anywhere else! :)< /text>

<text>Ordered a bed and nightstands. Delivery was a nightmare but with COVID I understood. What they don’t tell you is if you don’t pay for assembly they will send you a broken bed and you’ll need to go to Home Depot to fix it yourself because they will hang up the phone and not answer any emails. Never had a worse experience anywhere. It wasn’t something I could work around because I couldn’t place the boards on without this wood that looked ripped off.</text>< pictures>

<text>Finally went to the new Burbank store location... it was much easier to get to the store parking than the last one.   We came early in the morning so we found a parking spot right when you enter, but it looks like there's another parking lot on the other side of the front entrance.<//text>< gmapID>

My salesman was Marcus. He was very knowledgeable and patient. I finally zeroed in on a model and it was delivered this week. I had to do nothing but open the door for the guys who delivered it. They did all the work, they took away the old setup and assembled the entire new frame/boxspring/mattress even the bedskirt. They took away all of the wrappings etc. I am very happy with this purchase and Aetna Stores and would not hesitate to recommend them.<//text>

I bought a dresser online that arrived already built and the drawers were not closing at the same depth.
They were not lining up- making the dresser look weird.

They ended up sending someone to fix it and resolve the issue. They took responsibility and made sure I could enjoy my dresser. Very much appreciated!< /text>

<text>I have been calling this place and sent an email and still no response.. All I needed is assistance with an online order and there is no one answering calls or returning emails. I was interested in a few items and would like the 8% cash discount. How is this going to work if your showroom is closed? Also, the way it reads is I will have to pay online and then come in the store and pay cash (a second payment) and then the first will be refunded? That means I would have to “temporarily” spend close to 4 grand just to get the 8% discount? (Close to 2000 order) ... That isn’t going to work. I can come in and pay in cash and your team can place the order at that time, or apply a promo code for the 8% off that way I don’t have to double pay for a purchase.... so far this is extremely frustrating. The fact that as a customer I am unable to reach anyone with the company is ridiculous.<//text><rate>1<//rate><userid>108291691146041938893<//userid>< Response>

Finding the right pillows changed my life.  Not kidding.  These pillows worked magic on my neck.  Non-toxic is a huge plus.

I'm coming back for a bed next.  The guy here was very patient and he had an uncanny knack for picking out the exact products that would work or me based on my description of my issues and what I like.< /review>

Horrible.! If you are looking to buy furniture here, while it is a very good descent price, it is not worth the headache.! I've tried ordering 5 different items, 2 being a couch set, 2 ottomans and 1 dining set. The only emails I got were apologies that they are out of the product or that it is discontinued.... discontinued.?? Why is it still up on your website then.!?!?! It is not hard to contact manufactures to see what is their inventory looking like to update on your website. No, instead they have me purchase it, wait 3 days, finally email you saying they apologies but here is some "similar items". I didnt ask for similar items.! I asked for that one that your website that said you had it stock so I added to my cart and purchased..... I can honestly tell you first hand, dont purchase from here.! I myself have a lot of patience.! I work with people everyday.! This cuts the cake though... I applaud you Aetna for crushing my dreams of furnishing my new place with the furniture I wanted.! Please feel free to take a bow.!</text>

I bought a sofa bed, not to long ago. They charge arm and leg for delivered and assemble, they say 7 days for delivered it took almost 3 weeks and they send me a totally different material then the one we see and pay for, of course low quality.
I don't recommend to anybody.<//Text>

<text>I can't recommend Aetna Stores enough!  I've use them for years and recommend them weekly. Their quality of work is superb!  The owner Edmond is an Awesome guy. He's friendly, accommodating and professional.  They really know their stuff!  Not only with their upholstery but with their restoring and refinishing.

I ordered something on line and they put my order on hold because I wanted it to be sent to my sister's address and unless I sent them copies of my credit card and drivers license they would not proceed.  I ordered what I needed from Jeromes. A little more $$ but I have always liked the quality and service at Jeromes. I only went to Aetna because my disabled sister needed a specific kind of recliner and she sent me the link.. Never again.< /review>

This place is great. And it only took four business days to get my couch. A rep from the company asks you for a delivery window and a mover came and dropped it off in side my apartment complex.</Text>

I am fully satisfied with my purchase and the delivery service. I bought Denise Mink Fabric bed by Acme Furniture. Bed looks really good. I like the color, the fabric and the style. The delivery team was very punctual and professional. Artur and Gena were very polite and did the job well. Thank you and Aetna store!< /Text>

I cannot day enough good things about Aetna furniture. From beginning to end, the experience is incredible. Their customer service team is very professional. They provide updates whenever you call. Their contracted moving company makes the experience in valuable ! I HIGHLY recommend paying extra for assembly, they are quick, efficient and very thorough. I had Vlad and Yura help me with my assembly and these guys are like a factory: they quickly brought all items up, were very careful not to bump or cause damage, and even helped clean up everything afterwards and take all boxes down. They even helped me configure my room until it was perfect and to my liking! So professional, they made a stressful move very very easy. HIGHLY recommend !< /text>

Den and Eugen were very polite and professional! The store said it would take 5-10 days for delivery and my furniture came in 6 days. The time I was given was from 8am-12pm and they were here by 8:45am! I had 3 items delivered and assembled in a little over 2 hours. Den and Eugen were very efficient and did not waste any time! I really appreciated their help! Thank you!<//Text>

The quality is terrible, the boxes at the dresser and the night stand do not close until the end.  The bed was brought with spare parts from another bed and I waited 3 weeks for a replacement.  When other parts were brought in, during the assembly process it turned out that the slats on which the mattress lies more than the bed frame .... I called and said that I did not need such a bed and I could not sleep on the floor for 2 months and wait, so I want to  return the bed and the whole set.  They answered my request for a refund that they could not accept it back because it was collected.  Now I am paying a loan for this garbage, which is in the hallway.  I do not recommend buying furniture from this company, because they do not sell high-quality goods, which you will not be able to return later.</text>< pics>

We just ordered a new dining table to replace our old broken one.
We paid for assembly as well. Vlad and his team member came and were very professional and efficient in assembling. They also kept the space very clean and kept all the packaging pieces and trash were contained, and they kept all the pieces in the box and Vlad advised us to keep for one month in case there are any issues. That was extremely helpful. Vlad also figured out the problem with our old table leg and helped to fix that as well. Thank you Vlad and Aetna Furniture for such great service.</text>

At first I was a little bit skeptic to order from unfamiliar store. But the drawer came assembly, delivery team was quick and really professional. Seems I will be a customer of this store. Also customer service is 5 out of the 5.

<Text>If I could give Aetna 6 stars I would. I ordered a large bathroom suite and as it was readied for delivery I had to travel to the east coast for a family emergency. EVERYONE I dealt with at Aetna was incredibly kind and thoughtful. When I finally made it home, the team that came out for the delivery was amazing. Huge heavy pieces, navigated through a maze of narrow doors, each piece put exactly in place, all hardware attached and every shred of packing material vanished. Thank you Aetna. And customers -  if you happen to be shopping for bath vanities and such, be sure to check out their Design Element collection. I looked everywhere and nothing came close to matching the style, quality and value. The stuff is gorgeous. Thank you Aetna. I'll be back.<//Text><Name>susan robinson<//Name></record>

< Review>
if you want to buy furniture online , go somewhere else ! it will be much faster and easier.
-ETA from manufacturers are not up to date.
-credit card payment without secured system so if you want to buy more than 3000 dollards you have to pay by check or cash, not very convenient when you buy online.</Review>

This place has a huge variety of furniture in a lot of different design styles. The staff is not at all pushy and will leave you alone while you browse, but they're also very happy to answer any questions you have. The furniture isn't cheap, but it's reasonably priced for the quality. I didn't happen to find what I was looking for when I visited, but I'll definitely be back next time I'm looking for furniture.</Review>

Nick and Ted were great! Excellent communication on getting scheduled and super easy to work with. They were professional and courteous. Best of all, they cleaned up (including vacuuming)!! They were in and out in an hour and a half and I was left with a completely put together bunkbed, no mess, and 2 happy kids! The extra cost for the white glove installation was 100% worth it. I got to spend time with the family while they worked hard to assemble and clean up. They even took the trash with them. I will definitely come back!!<//Text>

I paid for the "white glove" delivery, which includes assembly.  It took 2 men 3.5 hours to assemble the bunk bed I ordered.  The assembly was well worth the price.  The assembly was well done.  The bunk bed was of very good quality.  They removed all trash when done.  The entire experience could not have been any better.< /Text>< pics>

Everything was great! The delivery was smooth. Everything arrive with 10 business days. Prices were beyond reasonable. Customer service with Irene was easy an flawless. We love the items. Easy to assemble and our living room looks great now!

Especially the coffee and end tables we ordered. They're great.

Thank you Irene (and everyone else at Aetna) for all your help!

I'll be telling everyone about Aetna Furniture!</Review>

DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!! I wouldn’t give them any stars if possible. I have never had such poor service. This company is beyond unprofessional. My fiancé ordered $8000 worth of furniture in the first week of December which they said we would get in 2weeks. It didn’t come til middle of January with all wrong equipment and furniture. It is February and we have gotten nothing but excuses on why they haven’t brought my mattress and my bed pieces. It has been such an awful experience and so stressful because they have came twice with wrong equipment. My mother has only her box springs and She has chronic back pain, which she takes strong medication for. Now they are saying we must speak with claims because they have to approve for us to get pieces we already paid for, but they have failed to bring right pieces why are we going threw claims. Very unhappy with money spent with them.

It’s funny that you try to make it seem as if you are doing all you can to fix the problem, but instead of giving us our money back for the mattress you never brought and then sent a email with demands in order to get our money back ( we would have to take down our review in order to get our money). Such bad business. Also, we have told you we are still pieces. We have only received partial parts and even if we had the parts, we are left to figure out how to put it together because we paid to have you guys put it together. I doubt you will be in business long if you continue on your business like this.< /review>

{'time': 1549412323313, 'text': "Dear Dashonda,\nWe are terribly sorry for the inconvenience you have had experienced with your order. All the missing parts were ordered from the manufacturer immediately and we were following up with the manufacturer every day trying arrange the fastest delivery to your location. Due to manufacturer's mistake, we received the wrong parts. Unfortunately there are some circumstances that are beyond our control but we are doing everything possible to find the way out in situations like yours. The manufacturer confirmed that the correct parts are ready to be shipped out to your location.\nOnce again, we apologize for the situation, Aetna Stores"}<//response>

< review>
Today my furniture was delivered. I had a wonderful experience. It was my first time shopping with them but it won't be my last. This man named Ilia delivered my furniture and set it up pretty fast. I was really impressed. On top of that he was just the nicest guy ever. Aetna is a great company and I recommend it to anyone.< /review>

<text>We ordered the Franca Grey Polyfiber Sectional Sofa a couple weeks ago and LOVE it!! The delivery guys were so nice and helpful and made sure everything was just how we wanted it. They set up the whole thing, carried it up all three flights of stairs, and cleaned everything up in a very efficient manner. The couch looks perfect, and is very comfy and spacious. I can tell it will last us a very long time:) Thank you guys for being so accommodating, helpful, and willing to answer all our questions!

Ilia and Levon from Aetna Furniture stores delivered all the items that I purchased in timely manner. They were both very professional, positive, and honest about doing their job. I had 2 items with upgraded white glove service for them to assemble a king size bed and a computer desk. They were very quick about doing the assembly for them.
I would definitely recommend to others for Ilia and Levon and I would love to get their assistance again next time.</Review>

<Text>I would not recommend purchasing from this furniture store due to poor customer service and lack of communication regarding my claims. I purchased a bunk bed from the company that arrived in good standing.  The contractors took 3 hours to assemble the beds and damaged/left out necessary screws. Instead of the contractors informing me about the damaged/missing items, they attempted to leave my home. However, I noticed the damages/missing items and reported them to the contractors and aetna. The contractors took pictures, told me that they will report the damages to aetna, and reassured me not to worry since the items will be replaced. However, the contractors never reported the damages. I've had a difficult time communicating with someone by phone regarding my claims and the claims department will not respond to my emails. Also, the claims department can only be reached by email and contacted me about my claims after 9:00 pm. The store refuse to replace the damaged items, per their policy and/or provide me with a full refund after their contractors damaged the bunk bed. I am not satisfied with purchasing a new bunk bed that is damaged and unsafe due to missing/damaged parts. I am also disappointed with the store not adhering to their policies and not resolving my complaint.</Text>< Rate>

My new bed was delivered as promised by a very polite young man who assembled it without any issues. He then unpacked my new mattress and box spring and put them on the bed for us (even though we had purchased those elsewhere).  He even took all the packing materials from the mattress and box spring out to our recycling bin. Very good service!  Well worth the nominal fee we paid for setup.< /review>

<Text>This is not even a store they are like an eBay for furniture And beside some that I went and placed my order at the store after placing my order online and having it pending for 2 weeks I go to the store and purchase the bed frames the man says 7-20 business days for delivery 5-7 for pick up and two weeks later I’ve had it and contacted them asking for it and they tell me it should be here Monday and an hour later they say it was never in stock to begin with yet I was charged cash and was given a receipt and then he tells me I need to wait for an appointment to see if the store has cash honestly worst experience HELEN sound like a computer copying and pasting the same thing every time you ask her something she says the same thing</Text>< GmapID>

They were both very professional, positive, and honest about doing their job. I had 2 items with upgraded white glove service for them to assemble a king size bed and a computer desk. They were very quick about doing the assembly for them.
I would definitely recommend to others for Ilia and Levon and I would love to get their assistance again next time.</text>< rating>

I cannot say enough good things about Aetna Furniture. From start to finish the service has been amazing. I am now a happy owner of a brand new bed!

Not only did they offer the cheapest price for the bed frame I wanted, but they made sure to keep an open line of communication the whole way through. Paul was very accommodating with a last minute address hangs.

Andrew and Alex came to my apartment and assembled the bed in record time. I would absolutely recommend this to all of my friends. GO WITH WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY!!!

Thank you Aetna for all your help :)<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I never normally leave reviews but I am so upset and angry about the customer service at this retailer.
I ordered a $250+ dresser that the delivery guy delivered inside my door - still boxed - and then left. I took the item out of the box and IMMEDIATELY noticed it was damaged - Marks up the side of the item and that the second drawer does not close properly and the colouring of the handles was not the same as pictured and written online (silver and not brass as I wanted). I called Aetna straight away - within 20 minutes of the delivery even! - noting the problems and that I would like it returned. I was told I had to email and could not reach anyone by phone to voice the issues or have it picked back up now.
After back and forth I was basically sent the refund policy with parts highlighted saying that it had to be in the original box (it is so not sure how this is relevant?!), the damage needs to be noted on the delivery note (If it was noted damage why should I have accepted it, and if they did not stay for it to be unboxed then how would the damage be noted?!) and that if I want specific colours I need to contact them first and it’s not always accurate on their website (so then what’s the point of the description if it can be completely different?!)
I can’t believe they then offered me a *$30* refund for a brand new faulty item that cost me $300 and I reported faulty within *30* minutes of receiving! That’s a complete insult.
Maybe if your item is delivered and there’s no problems this company is a 5*. But a business in my opinion is rated on how they deal with the issues. And this company is terrible. I’m now out of pocket $300 for a damaged dresser. Be warned.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1541003093612, 'text': 'Dear Emma,\n\nWe are truly sorry for the inconvenience you have had experienced with your order.

Entered all my information online and paid with a credit card, then I received an email from Irene asking for a signature and pictures of my ID and CREDIT CARD, I declined because it seemed  very weird and like a scam.

I DON'T RECOMMEND AETNA SORRY.<//review>

<review>Aetna Stores made us this beautiful sectional , according to all Our specifications, they suggested fabric , shape and color of the legs along with all the finer details that really makes our couch beautiful but also very very comfortable. The only drawback is you have to be ready to follow up and expect a delay in timelines but this is the case with every furniture store in the bay, they were nice enough to waive off delivery charges . It was definitely worth the wait as we get complements on our coach every time! I would definitely refer them and it's a much better and more feasible option no doubt then any other furniture stores. Thank you snow and team.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My girlfriend and I ordered a couch and a bed from Aetna Furniture with the white glove service (they put it together for you in your home) and we absolutely loved the furniture and the service. Alex helped us schedule the delivery at a time that was convenient for us and the two gentleman that delivered the furniture Ilia & Levan arrived right on time - put the furniture together in less than an hour - and cleared up all the trash. All while i was able to enjoy my morning Coffee. 10/10 I recommend this place if you're looking for good quality furniture in the LA area.< /Review>

< Review>
Went in to see a couch that I saw online but it wasn’t in the showroom. I wanted to test it out before buying, of course... No problem, I think. But, woman working there makes it clear that if I order it and don’t like it there is nothing she can do about it.

Now, as a business person, don’t you think you’d tell the customer, let’s see if we can get one delivered here OR let me find out where you can try it out? Nope. Sad, they lost me as a customer because I’m ready to buy!<//Review>

Vlad and Serg came and outdid themselves with the delivery. They had to maneuver around a ton of plants and statues to bring my coach in. Thanks you two!< /review>

They don’t have everything at the store, I drove 1 hour from home with traffic and waisted my time
No guarantee at all
They advertise 10% discount but the night before they change the prices setting more expensive ones
They don’t have a name on the wall, I was lost driving around the same place and I couldn’t see the sign
They charge you a delivery for every item not for the same service, if you buy 5 item you pay 5 deliveries !
They have only at the store the used items that the costumer return
And so on</Text>

A friend told us about this place, so we went with him yesterday after looking for the last few weeks at a variety of furniture stores. Not knowing what to expect, we were quite pleased with the quality of the furniture, the variety of options, and without planning on it, ended up buying a gorgeous leather sofa sectional and it was delivered that same night.</Review>
