This was a good late night spot. Had a great curry dish and they even shaped the rice like a heart! Some of the most amazing calamari I have ever had.<//text>

<text>This place is right down the street from my work and I love their lunch special, it doesn’t hurt my wallet and gives me a great tasting meal.  I was their today and my rice came in the shape of a heart, idk why but I liked it.  The chicken was tasty and crunchy, the way it’s supposed to be. At first it seems like a lot but it was a perfect portion.

The only think I believe they need to work on is meal diversity. It seems like it’s a huge menus but it’s just the same items with different choices of meat. Or maybe reduce it and make it simpler to follow.<//text>< pics>

Stopped here on the way to a show at the Fox Theater. I noticed they offered a whole menu of martinis, so I ordered a gin martini. I don't know what I was served, but it was not what I ordered. I'm not even sure it was gin. I couldn't pinpoint the flavor. About 15 minutes after I ordered, I was served some kind of liquid in a margarita glass, with lime wedges. I could not finish the drink it was so terrible.

Bathroom requires obtaining a giant key from the staff, and when I was there, they seemed understaffed, so it took a while.

On the upside, the food was tasty with generous sizes.< /review>

Great food.  The Appetizer Platter and fish Pad Thai noodle dish is excellent.  Inexpensive and great selection of martinis.  Tried the Thai Tea Caramel Martini and is was actually pretty tasty.  Recommend a visit and certainly to try the inexpensive dishes.< /Review>

My husband and myself  always  come  and dine at this restaurant. We find it  a nice place to dine.  Few days ago we noticed they have new people (servers) and one doesn't get the order  only the payment. She is a Thai lady. When I followed up our order she said" the other lady get your order not me" in a loud like angry voice. She doesnt smile and  her face is not peasant to the costumers.I was shocked the way she responded me, maybe it is the way they are? but her costumer service is not nice to be in this place -California.  The management should train her how to handle  guest  or better yet she  will not talk to costumers and she will be assign in the kitchen.  I noticed one old lady guest talked to her for something  and when I turned my head to them the lady was so upset how she dealt the old lady costumer because that Thai server just walk away from her. I hope the management  will know about it . They are the only Thai restaurant in that Mission Inn Avenue and so they should maintain good costumer service. Yes it is nice to have Thai people server because  of the  concept they are carrying but make sure  to train your people.< /text>

I have been here a few times before I decided to commit to a 3 star review. Why did I give a 3 star review you ask? It's always just okay. Not bad, but okay. Yesterday we sat out side for lunch, and the lunch special seemed like a great deal, it came with an egg roll, a little salad and Tom Yum soup. Well we never got our soup, and I don't chase waiters around...< /text>

Their panang curry is the best I have ever had. The flavors were perfectly balanced. The brown rice and orange chicken were also  excellent. The wonderful elephant decor is a lot of fun, too. Our servers were patient and friendly with our large group.< /text>

<review>Let me start by saying that I have eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants and several times while visiting Thailand itself. After reading the mixed reviews, let me give you mine. My wife and I had the pad see ew with duck. I have never had a great plate of food with chunks of duck meat for less then $20. I paid $13 here and it tasted great!! Also had the seafood Currie with peanut sauce and that too was great at $14. For appetizers we had the crab Rangoon wontons and calamari that was awesome. Food came out quick and hot. Had a few Jack Daniels and coke at $5 a piece and can you say a Little coke with the Jack, it was almost a double. If your looking at great food for a great price, this is it. If you don’t have time to wait for good food, then go to a fast food restaurant. Will definitely be back again!!! Hope this helps<//review><response>None< /response><username>Joe Gallardo</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I’ve been here 3 times now with either friends or family and everytime the service and food has been wonderful! It’s not crowded so there is no wait. It really should be though because it’s a great place. My new favorite in downtown. P.s. I’m a resident so I’ve also tried another Thai place but this one is way better quality in taste.<//review>

Who are these fools saying that this place got them sick or is bad? This place is great and I did not get sick from any of the food. Just because food is taking longer than normal means the food will turn out better than to just hurry it. If you want fast food then go eat fast food and avoid restaurants. I like this spot and have it saved to go again anytime I'm in Riverside.<//review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>The service was great and very customer oriented. I got the vegetable pad Thai (since they were out of tofu). When I got it, it was a red color, no peanuts, and almost a solid mass. I wouldn't go there again especially because other people had similar complaints. My pad Thai sauce was thick and bland, vegetables didn't seem cooked, and the rice you could tell had sat out for awhile. Service was great but terrible food.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Not very impressed with this place - I had the kapow which was supposed to be spicy and it was so bland it would have been great for someone who loves flavorless things. Thai tea was powdery and sweet and my cup came super sticky I didn't even touch it. Hard pass.< /Review>< username>

Everything about this place is terrible. They claimed to have lost our order but it miraculously appeared when it was time to pay. The food was mediocre at best. It's over priced and underwhelming. Will never go back.<//Text>

Our experience was alright. The food was alright but the service was terrible. We waited 45 mins for them to take our order and then an hour for them to tell us they had no more beef. They didn’t even give us our drinks we ordered. I found a hair in my food, which I for sure know it wasn’t one of mine and the waitress gave as attitude and was rushing us to order.< /review>

I liked the food but they were out of 3 things that I tried to order: tofu, lamb, and a drink on their holiday menu. Why have them on the menu and not have them available? Or tell us when we sit down at least...</Review>

This is a cute restaurant that serves everything just like you'd expect. I got the salad, the teriyaki chicken, and had corn water. Nothing bad about here, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to try for their first time.</Text>

Gave it another chance because we were at the art walk and decided to give it another chance .. learned our lessons.. never again</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Everything started ok. Then the order came out wrong. It took 25 minutes for the two entrees to be served after the first three were delivered.  Drink orders  were 45 minutes apart. Service is very slow as there are not enough servers. The food, if you can get it, is good.<//review>

Service horribe, food horrible, and not worth the price.  Food was completely overpriced . We ordered the spring rolls 7.00 (which was actually not that bad), bbq chicken (the menu said it was grilled but clearly fried.  One bite and I had to spit out it tasted like the chicken had gone bad),  chicken cashew (veggies were not fresh at all) chicken pad see yew 10.00( which was the dinner entree, portions were like a kids size)  the Thai tea was served in a small glass for 3.00!!  We didn't get our food until about 40 minutes being in the restaurant.  The only good thing that came out of it was that 2 of the dishes was taken out of check after explaining 3 times yo 3 different waitresses Still our bill was 25.00 and we didn't even enjoy it  what a waste of time and money.   I will never go back to that place.  If your looking for a good Thai restaurant Best Thai on spruce is AMAZING and Little Buddha in Mira Loma is definitely better than  this place<//Review></record>

After I showed them the description on the menu they took it back and added them on. Should've comped our bill. When my wife asked for refill of her drink they said no refills. Wouldn't recommend, would not go back.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>104875556399002017687</user_id>< user_name>

Went here for dinner, had appetizers which were alright and extremely oily. Then went to order dinner and they were out of tofu and I'm vegetarian so paid $20 for some oil and a beer and now I feel sick. Won't be coming back.< /text>

I loved the staff they were friendly and professional.  They did an amazing job on my daughter's manicure and pedicure.  Kathy did an amazing job on my manicure and pedicure as well. I loved the color I picked. Such a beautiful color. I will definitely come back to this place.</text>

I took a chance on a smaller nail salon and let me tell you do not go here. I was hoping to see Kathy because I read so many good reviews about her work but I got two men that completely messed up my full set and pedicure. I could’ve done a better job in my opinion and I was upset by how much I had to pay for nails I didn’t even like< /Text>

The owner is a prime example of what happens when you let your emotions take over your brain and mouth.  There is no common sense with this one.  They couldn’t even follow something as simple as wearing a mask.  Ya know in countries like Japan they wear masks when they get a cold to help prevent spreading their cold to others, we even practiced that in the military.  Here some Americans are so self involved they can’t even wear a mask during a pandemic.  It’s not really that hard.  If we who serve in our nations military can do it to protect our brothers and sisters because we care for each other’s health, then what is the problem with some of these civilians?!  I attempted to go to this store a few months ago and I chose to keep walking, from the reviews sounds like I made the right choice.< /text>

I am so happy I found this store! I am trying my best to live a healthy life; health is so important and we must take care of it. This store carries all organic, non toxic, high end, USA made products. I am so please with everything I have purchased, we have decided to buy our house products from ECO CHIC (and organic clothes), because not only are their products superb, but all the staff is friendly, relatable and attentive to ones needs, very accommodating too! I don't live close but they send me videos of their items and answer all my questions in a timely manner! (is like having a personal shopper) I receive my items in the mail right away (and they always send extra items/gifts) I love Chrissy the owner and what she stands for, she truly cares for her customers and her purpose is always to help, find an answer and a solution to my health needs and more! I love to see her children in the store, I value a family owned business. I prefer 100 times to support this business than any big box retail store! Love Eco Chic, their products and all their staff! In this time when people have become distant and customer service has gone down the drain, what a gift it is to find a store where people are friendly and smile back :) and you can see their smile, warms my heart! Thank you Eco, than you Chrissy!</text>

<Text>We drove 2 hours to shop and we were not disappointed.  We found several items we were looking for, had all of our questions answered & even researched on the spot, and left with some treasures that we didn’t even know they carried.  And, recommendations for other local places were shared that turned out to be gems as well.  We can’t wait to go back!</Text><Name>Stephanie Chandler< /Name>< gmap_id>

<review>Found this gem of a store and have made the trip from Concord several times to keep supporting local and businesses that take a stand against the insanity that is happening. I found her book on one of my trips and have already helped fix my son’s constipation, allergies & car sickness with natural remedies I feel safe and happy to give my kids. Also very proud to be supporting such a stand up all American business owner.<//review><time>1618948540394<//time><Rate>5</Rate><userid>100548297403551604183< /userid><gmapID>0x80853d5447de45fb:0x7a08b9d14d4ea5a6</gmapID><user_name>Christy Papalii</user_name></record>

This is my favorite store and I drive from the East Bay to support this business. I love that I can grab my raw milk, supplements and the cutest shoes for my little one, all at one store.< /Review>

<rating>2< /rating><text>There’s some clothing there that reads “resist tyranny” or something along those lines 😬 Their cashier wasn’t wearing a mask when she checked me out and that kinda confirmed the message they are sending when you visit. I hope it’s not political but in this climate I wish people would just follow science. Wearing a mask isn’t that hard. It’s even more frustrating because we are the only county in the Bay Area stuck in the red tier right now.  The products are all still top quality though.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I am review as an online customer.  Eco Chic has a wide variety of health necessities.  I love that I can order so many different items on my list from one store. I know that the store is ran with integrity and know that my order will come well packaged and in a timely manner.  I highly recommend their Instagram page where there is SO much  helpful information on the different products in store.</Text>< Pics>

Owner and staff are always, kind, helpful, have gone above and beyond for me to answer any questions or concerns. On rainy days, they have even let me pay my invoice online and brought out my purchase to my van bc I had all my littles with me. On top of that, they have the great apparel and accessories, it’s a one stop shop! Don’t miss out on supporting this small business!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Wonderful customer service! I called in with some questions about natural allergy help for my kiddos and not only was I able to purchase over the phone for pick up later, my car was full of kids and Mika saw me pull up to let my oldest run in and she quickly handed it off to him. Thankful for small, family run stores that make mom life simpler ❤️<//Text>< Date>

My all time FAVORITE store! Not only do they help with any questions you may have, all the store personal are friendly and welcoming. You dont get that kind if service when you shop anymore. They also leave you alone if you dont want help, dont worry lol Anyways love all the organic and natural alternatives for my family!<//text>

Based off the name I thought that their products would be eco friendly, many were not. Along with that the store is not following CDC guidelines and not requiring customers to wear masks, so if you are like me and have a health condition, or are elderly or have young children this store is not safe for you, there have been many customers seen without a mask, so i wouldn’t recommend buying any of their products, who knows if any of the customers that have been there without a mask have had covid and touched products. 0/10 find better ACTUAL eco friendly products elsewhere !!</review>

I love the brand choices, usually going into a store I feel the burden of searching for the best quality, best ingredients, what’s really organic and what’s not. Here I feel that work is already done, I can relax and trust the quality I’m buying. Super grateful for that!</review>

<Time>1595352451263<//Time><rating>1<//rating><Review>Use to work a few doors down from this business so I would pop in on my break occasionally. Rarely was there even an employee in the store, several times I couldn't purchase products because no one was there to assist me. When there was an employee present they were on the phone and ignored anyone who came in the door that wasn't one of their friends. Also it is always weirdly dark in there.
The label "Eco" Chic always felt very green washy since so many of their products aren't eco friendly. There are so many other great small business with similar products lines, I now support in its place.</Review>< pictures>

A native Latino Vacaville resident was treated very rudely and poorly by the owner.  As I see the other glowing reviews of how kind she was I can’t help but wonder if it was based upon race... which is really sad...

The owner was also video taped saying inappropriate things about “China-Ing”  schools and town related to Covid 19 at the school board meeting.  She does not believe Covid is a real threat.  Her business can’t be safe with such extreme beliefs.  Don’t shop here.<//Text>

This is one of my favorite stores in Vacaville. They always greet me with a genuine smile and hello when I walk in.  You can tell that excellent customer service and knowledge of their products is the cornerstone of their values.

I arrived a few minutes after they closed last week and Rebekah was so nice to open the store back up to let me buy a few items. She kept a smile on her face the whole time and was extremely patient with me and all my questions on a new product I was purchasing.

I am very health conscious and extremely cautious about what I put into my body.  Eco Chic is my go to store for all my holistic remedies, supplements and protein supplements in Vacaville. They even have products for my 2yr old son that I don't have to worry about giving him.< /text>

<Review>Great finished product installation of four new tires, and services. This is walk in, first come, first serve basis, although, I was there at 8:30 AM still a 2.5 hour wait. Normally, not so unreasonable, but a loud playing television of Fox News was least enjoyable; I did not appreciate being obligated to listen to the politics of this or any other establishment.< /Review><userid>110793340086227371648< /userid><Time>1621362558068<//Time>< Pictures>

Above and beyond customer service. Leonard was amazing in his effort to get me a replacement tire and back on the road as quick as possible. He didn't have my tire in stock and he called other area tire shops trying to find me a tire. He ended up ordering a set of tires and had them first thing in the morning and got back on the road. The cost of the tires were $200 cheaper than other places I had called. Without a doubt I will buy all my tires from Daniels Tire Service.< /Text>

The staff is friendly and professional and when I have price shopped them they typically are the best deal.  I have taken a car, a truck, and a minivan to them and I have referred many family and friends to them.  The newly remodeled lobby is also nice.
Update: Just picked up a 2-inch piece of metal in one of my tires. As usual they took care of the issue, got me great deal, and got me back on the road fast.
UPDATE: I had a flat tire yesterday and thankfully was only about a mile away from the shop.  They put some air in my spare tire and fixed my tire while I was at work.  I only had to stop in for a few minutes later in the day to get the tire put back on.  Another win for Leonard and his team.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMORRucGCs-RDO85zF9_lhrN0ddBl_3M1VKtwRE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCWqOsDLLtE_XYOFplm3FP922Gp0cHHJBt_9Vt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

I was so glad that this was the same place that my husband Terry went to a few years ago for a new tire that had blown out on interstate 10 , they where so helpful and we had oil changed and they went over his truck thoroughly. Being from Illinois was so blessed that we had a wonderful experience. Now my husband has passed and was great to have the same experience they gave a woman , I haven’t had very good luck in a mans mechanic world. Thank you Daniels Tire.< /Review>

Just returned again  on the 21st of May 2021 for a true rotation and oil change. Brake inspection  as well. My brakes are still good. I trust them to not sell me something I don't need.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I had taken my wife to have her blood taken. After we came back out, the car wouldn’t start. Seemed like it was a computer issue. We got AAA to come out and they jump started it.  We then drove straight to Daniel’s and told him how the car was having issues. After first telling me they were too busy, Jose told me he would take a quick look. After determining it was probably the battery, he had one of his mechanics drive us home in Jose’s personal truck and said he would work on it later. By 5pm it was taken care of. This is the second time recently I have just showed up and Jose has taken care of me. Love this place!</review>< user_name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The reviews definitely don’t lie. I had come across DTS before and seen their great reviews when I was searching for a shop that did basic maintenance for if and when I needed it, at least I knew where I would go first, but it wasn’t until my alternator started failing that I actually ended up doing service with them. They are in accordance with my warranty company (thankfully) and since I had read about them previously I was quite relieved to find that they were associated with them. I took my car in on Monday, and had it back in great working condition with a new alternator the following day (Tuesday). Through every step of the process Jose was extremely kind and helpful, he constantly assured me that I’d be taken care of and that, I was. He was on top of everything and extremely professional. I will definitely be coming back if I have any further car issues (knock on wood) and I highly recommend them.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I came in to this shop to have an issue looked at here; due to this shop being a CarMax RepairPal partner. It didn't go very well.

I was kept in the dark the entire time and every chance I got to ask a question regarding what was going on with my car, I was met with an exploited opportunity, by a salesman to lord over my head, how much I did not know... Fine, but my questions were still not being answered.

The transparency was not there early in the process. The guy showed up and told me to sign something to get my car looked at. I was explained CarMax would pay for the check up over the phone, but still got charged in the end. After bringing this up to the salesman and asking him to review one previous visit (same issue, zero fees) the salesman refused to bring up my "file." I had to take a picture of what his tablet had to say about my car in order for me to start getting info.

In the end I got a screenshot of what was wrong with my battery pack and I got the actual service paperwork, which I needed to answer questions and seek out my options. Was treated very rudely, felt super uncomfortable, and felt left in the dark, which is why I don't usually go to shops alone.<//Text>< Pics>

We always will call them to try and get them to pay for services but sometimes they will not. In order to check that battery which is located under the seat it takes time to do that service.

During these times it’s very uncertain the way people treat each other so customer service is vital to maintaining kindness between the customer and the business. I was greeted by Luis with the utmost respect and kindness. I knew I was in the right place to have both my vehicles taken care of. The whole staff was honest and straightforward with my vehicles issues. I would definitely refer this business on top of a dealership any day.</review>

Everybody there seemed to know what they were doing

Took just over an hour to get my oil changed and tires rotated and out the door for just under $60.< /Text>

I’ve been to this shop a couple of times, and I will continue to come back! The last time I was there. They unfortunately weren’t able to service my vehicle. They advised I take my 2011 white Kia Optima to the local dealership for a full diagnostic checkup concerning the issue I was having! I was totally fine with that! That kind of honesty is what I believe a business should be all about! Instead of guessing and trying to work on a problem, which potentially could make things worse? They gave me a straight up suggestion on the best thing to do! They even put oil into my vehicle without a charge, and let me keep it on their property until my towing arrangements were in order. All the associates at Daniels are extremely nice and understanding especially during these trying times, when finances are pretty tight. Jose was one of the gentleman I had talked with and so was Zachary. Both were extremely friendly. There were a couple of other associates that I had spoke with, but couldn’t recall their names. I would definitely recommend Daniels Tire of Bermuda Dunes Ca. For a service! I will definitely be returning myself! Thank You Again, Matt</text>

These Guys at Goodyear Tires & more are the BEST. The 2 front desk Guys are very helpful & experienced. They explain the details & make me feel comfortable. Service is fast & efficient. They offer shuttle service, that many places do not. That's meaningful to me, so I can be home doing things versus sit in lounge all day!  Thumbs up to these guys. They have replaced many parts on my car (2003 Honda CRV).< /text>

I towed my car on Wednesday, Friday it was ready! The fact that Jose and Lenard and everyone in the shop is on the same page, it just blows my mind. The customer service I received was perfect. They keep in touch with you of what's happening and what's going to happen. I never once had to call them for any status. If you bought you car at Carmax and you have Max care, no problem they take care of dealing with the insurance. I'm so thankful for this shop, no more trips to Riverside carmax for me cause I found someone that's Local & honest, Thank you guys so much!< /Review>

It took 2 hrs but they offered me a shuttle ride if I didn’t want to wait. I live close by so I just walked home and came back when it was ready. I called when it had been 2 hrs and it was reassuring like they said it would be. They even checked my battery and let me know it was low needing to be replaced soon. I came back two days later to have them retest my battery so I could see the results and they did it for free. I didn’t even have to wait. They checked it right away. Very nice, good customer service! Also fair price for oil change $35. I will be going back again!< /review>< Pictures>

I went in with a battery issue and was told to check with interstate re my warranty.  I went there and was not happy so I came back.  My card was taken over the phone and battery was installed in 1/2 hour.  Excellent customer service by the guy who helped me.  Now I know why I was referred to you by the Camacho family.  Thanks

<text>Actually they were really good as far as my car went. I called before goi g in to make appt. They said give them 45 or so no appointment need. I get there they said they were a little backed up it would be 1 11/2. I said ok I'll go eat and stuff then. So I left came back and had to wait another hour and half but that was ok if they did a good job and they did.  I pay he gives me my keys ect but I couldnt leave because they parked a car behind me and was working on it and it took another 1/2 hr to get it out of the way! That super irritated me and ruined a decent experience. My time is valuable I had already been waiting kind of a long time and yo wait another 30 was more than I could take, I almost blew. Everything else was top notch though.< /text><username>Debra Rapp< /username><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

<Review>Was driving to Phoenix from LA when we got a flat tire on I-10.  With a fully loaded car and 2 kids, we wanted to get a new one ASAP.  They fit us in immediately and we were out of there in less than 30 min.  It was a great experience and they made the hassle much more bearable.  Thank you.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1590177692222, 'text': 'We understand the inconvenience of an unexpected tire service, Colin.

I've been going here since I moved here 3 years ago. They're pretty straight with me. They always remember my name, my cars, and know who I am as soon as I drive up. Sure, they are not the cheapest, but they will work with you, tell you what can wait, and stand behind their service when there is a problem.< /Text>

Great experience at Daniel's after attempting to get my car serviced at another Goodyear service that is closer to my home in La Quinta. Tne service writer there said to call in for an appointment in the next day or two. No apology or concern that they weren't going to service my vehicle. I called Daniels and spoke to Leonard who invited me to come in and I would be the second in line. I arrived and they quickly got the process going. I also noted Daniels pricing for oil changes were 40 to 45 % lower and included tire rotation. My
first impression of Leonard was that he was a bit gruff, but very business like and thorough. I later observed and was very impressed by the interaction Leonard and others had with the many customers coming and going. They seemed to know everyone by name and I saw them attempt to find solutions to their needs looking for options that would be most cost beneficial to the customer. Something one doesn't see that often anymore and really impressed me. Upon completing my service the tech who performed the work spoke to me and said he had topped up everything except the power steering as it takes a dealer only product which they do not carry and rather than take chance and use the fluid they stock that I could pick up a bottle at the dealership and come back and he would put it in for me. Needless to say Daniels will be my dealer of choice going forward.</text>

Your staff is awesome!  I had a situation we're I was going to be stuck out on the road miles away from home.  I called your facility at 5:55pm. Your shop was closing at 6.  I explained my problem and your manager said he would wait for me. I arrived about 6:15pm and to my surprise they were expecting me.  I was so relieved and cared for!  From me and my family we'd like to thank you!  Terrific service is what I received.  Tell your guys thank you and great job. Ramon Villalobos< /review>

<username>Ed Rempalski< /username><rate>5< /rate><review>Sorry to say, one of the Best and Worst experiences I've had.  Thanksgiving holiday, found my daughters Jeep with a low front tire on Black Friday.  Her tires looked worn as well, and she needed to get back home to LA on Sunday.  Googled Tire shop, found "Ramona Tire, Firestone" and headed over, this is NOT Daniel's tire but please read on as this is a dual review.  They were very friendly, took a look and said the tires were too old (by date code) to touch.  One guy tells me they have a buy 2 get two special and I say prefect!  Inside, the next guy says that deal is gone (it's Black Friday, odd) but they have a buy 3 get one, I say OK, they charge my card right then.  Here's the story;
1- No tires in stock, they will have by noon on Sat (they are closed Sun).
2- They tell me that they will call when tires arrive, (they didn't)
3- I called Sat at 1p, no tires, told me before 2p latest.
4- I drove there at 2:30p, still no call, no tires, then they tell me "the company that makes them went out of business", wanted to switch to another brand, and these were not in stock either but could be delivered from Indio.
5- I said cancel please, lost faith, poor communications, and seemed just janky overall.
6- Insult to injury, they refuse to cancel my credit card and tell me that they will send me a check in a week or two "from corporate".
7- Then the Manager has the gall to ask for my future business!  Ha!  And this shop was deserted both Friday and Saturday, but the guys there managed to pass the time with their BBQ.

Now it's Saturday at 3p and I still need to get my daughters Jeep fixed.

I see a Goodyear Sign across the road (actually Daniel's Tire Service) and take a chance, here's the rest of the story;
1- They were very nice, agreed on tire need, could get the same tires that were on the car, but had to deliver from Indio, but could be done by 4:30p!  I said YES Please!
2- While they were prepping the car with wheels off, the mechanic shows me the rear brakes, they are shot (I'm a tech, they were bad, rotors shot), they didn't have parts, but could get them in time, go!
3- Rear shocks also shot, really shot, not in stock but could be delivered, Go!
4- I watched 4 different deliveries of my parts, all went smoothly, and I rolled out of there at 4:45p, one hour and forty-five minutes from when I walked in!
5- They charged my card AFTER everything was complete.

I can't say enough how professional and fast the folks at Daniel's Tire Service were.  They were moderately busy and managed to pull everything together for me in time and at a reasonable cost, that is how it's done folks.<//review>< Date>

I've been going to Daniel's Tire Service in Bermuda Dunes for years.  They are knowledgeable and fair.  I've purchased this for several vehicles,  had routine maintenance and major repairs done here.  The team is courteous and helpful,  and repairs are performed as quickly as possible.

I never feel like i'm being "sold" work that I don't need,  and they always give me options.

If you're looking for a new neighborhood shop,  or just for good tires, I recommend Daniels!< /Review>

<text>I needed to have my 2004 Lincoln Town Car diagnosed in regards to faulty suspension. I dropped the car off in the morning and about an hour later had a complete report from Leonard Ortiz on what was the problem, what needed to be done and at what estimated cost. Friendly, prompt, professional, to the point. Completely satisfied and would recommend Daniels Tire Service to my friends and family.< /text></record>

I highly recommend DANIELS TIRE SERVICE the team went above and beyond the call of duty. Also the place is very cost conscious compares to other shops close by.

I came in to check and change vehicle fluids, also ask to check my differential casa I was hearing noises in my rear. They recommended only my front and rear needed fluid change but as I drove away the noise continued rather than taking a look inside they requested to change the hole thing. Currently I'm waiting to see if they find the part or a solution . They are very helpful.😀👍👍👍I  posted the review yesterday and today the owner reached out to me and was concerned about my review,  after clarifying what was going on he understood why. Nothing negative to say about the staff, I was very appreciative that he reached out to me so promptly. ✊right on for the prestigious customer service. I was even offered a refund for the rear service. Though they didn't have to, It says a lot. I  will return for future service< /text>

I gave NAPA 5 stars for so many ressons.
1. I live in sugarloaf 3.9 miles from the store. Which is respectful however this is big bear lake... 8,000 feet elevation. I do not complain about prices here.. I bought 1 oil filter? I hope you enjoy my photo.< /review>

I was in need of a deep cycle marine battery and the woman who answered the phone and helped me in the store went out of her way to help me make the proper selection.

Great customer service and I truly appreciated it.</review>

During a Christmas day snow storm the owner opened the store to sell snow chains to stranded Big Bear Lake visitors. This store is highly recommended.<//Review>

Nicely remodeled store, they have everything and run shuttles so I’ve been able to order parts in the morning and have them sometimes the same day. Working on my GFs truck and has been a blessing having a great parts store to rely on! And locally owned!<//text>

Bought an auto part in NAPA Redlands and thought I could return it to this store NAPA Big Bear and they refused to take it even though NAPA's return policy says I could.
Way to screw over your local citizens NAPA!
I guess I am buying parts on Amazon from here on out. Good luck NAPA.

Didn't have everything I needed on hand, but they were very helpful in suggesting available options to me. Fairly quick customer service with lots of customers waiting.</Review>

<date>1510955819994</date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I have been a loyal patron for nearly 20 years but I will NEVER take my business here again! I have a battery under warranty that is leaking acid out of the posts so bad that it eroded the entire terminal and ate through the main power relay wire. I tried returning the battery but the manager claims that the liquified corrosion is standard and not a problem. It is bubbling around the terminals and posts but she will charge the battery and I can pick it up in a few hours... Lmao

<text>Horrible service!!!  I walk in there are 4 guys standing around ,no customers. I Just needed a battery for my car remote.  Instead of looking up in the computer to assist me on the battery typ. A guy in his 40's about 6' just pointed to the end of the Isle and said I could look there.  When I asked if they had a small screwdriver to open my remote ,he litterly tossed a small flathead screwdriver on the counter ( which obviously was going to be too big)  I was astonished at how rude he was by his actions an disinterest in helping!! I'm a Law Enforcement Officer ! And a female which was the only reason why I was able to keep my cool!# I'm used to dealing with these kind of miserable people! #  Just quit your job allready!    Just learn how to treat others the way you want to be treated or at least the females in your family!!</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c4b3892e8ac071:0x43c16d62936c6113</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you're looking for a good place to relax, have a cigar, have a beer or cocktail, this is the place. No judgement. No reservations. The concurrent crowd is just as pleasing to chat with. As a local, I give this place a solid seal of approval.</text>

My friend and i came to segovias tavern and just enjoyed the vibes and music. Loved the punk,rock,metal music in the background. Drinks were great. Local tattoo artist that works across the street was their and was very welcoming to us non locals. Bar tender A1. It was just a very chill place and whenever i have a chance to come back to monterey i will definitely visit segovias. A plus was the beetlejuice movie playing in the background. 5 Star worthy tavern!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

My only complaints are that they only take cash and since so many people like to celebrate there, sometimes you get the groups that insist on "jukebox wars" and prevent you from playing something from another genre.< /Text>< name>

<Text>I  couldn't be happier with the work that Organized Garage Solutions did for me to help organize my garage. The flooring turned out beautifully and the cabinets are a great addition.  They are well built and offer me plenty of space to store items in a neat and orderly way.   I  am so glad I  called Organized Garage Solutions.  They yelp reviews really are true. This company is the best and I  would DEFINITELY recommend them to anyone looking to organize your garage.</Text>< pics>

This review is long overdue! I received three estimates for cabinetry and Jay's team impressed us to the fullest. His professionalism and the quality of the craftsmanship far surpassed the other bidders. Truly the decision was a no brainer. We continued to be impressed with the product that safely (and beautifully) holds our belongings. So glad we were able to work with him and hope to again in the future. We highly recommend without any reservation. Thank you Organized Garage Solutions!<//text>

All of those that I interacted with were responsive to my questions and modifications.  The staff person that worked with me on the design of the shelving was great to work with.  The installation was on time, fast, and they helped me put some of the heavier boxes on the higher shelves.  After living with the system for some time, I am thinking of adding a few more items.  I had a great experience. Highly recommend them.</Text>

<text>I ordered some cabinets and a workbench area. The cabinets were delayed due to shipping and logistics. No fault of the company. To make sure that I was happy the guys made an exception and came in in a Saturday to do the install. They were on time early and very professional. They did the install and it looks amazing. It's everything I had wanted. Thanks guys stellar work!!! 10/10 will use again and recommend.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1624390521174, 'text': "Thank you!

<Review>I love my new garage. Organized Garage Solutions helped me plan for my dream of a gym within my garage space. We replaced open shelving with beautiful modern cabinets and my cement flooring was replaced with a granite looking durable coating.

We have used this company for 3 different “phases.” They have always been extremely professional and knowledgeable.  Their quality is top notch!  I highly recommend them.

I reached out to Garage Solutions and they sent one of their premier designers, Ren. He listened and made some recommendations and provided a 3D CAD. We just installed the polyuria floor and it’s absolutely fabulous.<//review>

This is copied from my Yelp review in August 2019 when the work was originally done. I feel the same way today. Everything has held up beautifully!

I don't know what we're more pleased with: Our gorgeous garage floor, our beautiful cabinets, or the A+ service from every individual we had with OGS. I'm a property manager of 30+ years, with high standards, and the quality of work and courteous, professional people exceeded my expectations. Everyone with whom I've dealt (from owner to each worker) has been courteous, reliable, helpful, patient, and more.

The flooring makes the garage look like an interior room - gorgeous! It is bright and smooth, with just enough roughness to help prevent slips. And it's going to be so easy to keep clean. Dustin and Hector took extra care in its installation; e.g., extra concrete prep for cracks, taping off the kitchen door so no dust came inside, and more. When they left, other than the floor, there was nothing to know they had been there - spotless.

The cabinets were made to exact measurement requirements, the material is strong and feels substantial. The hinges and drawers function smoothly. Varand and Victor were perfectionists in their installation, ensuring every piece was perfectly level, secure, and no screw was exposed (even ones against a wall that would never be seen). It ended up I had a gas valve in the way that I didn't think was where it was, and they kindly discussed options and worked extra to accommodate the pipe. They, too, left the garage and new cabinets spotless.

Jay worked with me on the order, and I admit (a bit embarrassingly), I changed my mind on cabinet measurements a few times. Jay was patient making the changes in the drawings and pricing and showed nothing but patience with me.

Now, pulling into our garage makes me smile, as it's like an extra room in our home - a very nice extra room!<//Text>

<review>OGS did a fantastic job with my garage makeover!  One day to do the floor, one day for the shelving and slat walls.  Took about a half day each time, very professional, kept the work area clean and asked me questions regarding the particular placement of the shelving and slat walls.  Very impressed with the quality and all the attachments that can be used with the slat walls - baskets, hooks and other items to keep my stuff off the garage floor!  Well done, I would highly recommend these guys for your garage project.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1614098536630, 'text': "It's been a pleasure working with you Michael!

<Text>I was extremely impressed from start to finish with Organized Garage Solutions. Kevin was terrific, he came out, measured everything, we laid out a variety of options. He sent me over a matching series of estimates as well as 3D renderings, all with no obligation and no payment. I could have taken all of that difficult and very detailed work and gone elsewhere. I didn't because Kevin's professionalism made me feel he was the best fit for the job.
On the day of the install Marc Cortez came with another gentleman. What impressed me was based on the discussions with Kevin Marc brought options. Turned out our job was a little more complicated due having a combination of wood and metal studs. We came up with an alternate gameplan for which Marc had options ready. Additionally, he was able to cut and adjust on set of overheads to make everything fit and look perfect. The install was beautiful. Additionally, I had just had a soft water system installed and the workmanship was extremely poor with plaster residue being left on the newly epoxy'd garage floor. I asked Marc about it strictly for advice as he mentioned that they also did floors and he appreciated the work that had been done. On his own and without requesting any sort of additional payment, simply because he is a good man, Marc got some acetate and with some elbow grease managed to get what to me felt like cement that I couldn't get off the floor up without damaging the floor.
I cannot recommend these folks enough.<//Text>< pics>

Talked to the owner, Jay, to book a visit and free estimate. He was very nice. The best part was I never felt he was trying to just sell me something. As promised an associate named Kevin showed up a few days later. He was extremely knowledgeable and answered every single question I had and that already is impressive because I can be a tuff customer. I got the quotes a few days later as promised. They gave me a very fair deal and accommodated my schedule. Today the installer came exactly on time as promised and finished the job in the exact amount of time as quoted and promised. Product and customer service were both spectacular. My wife and I are very pleased. Can highly recommend. Tiles were cut precisely to the wall and we are very happy. Great job. Very impressed. Garage looks finally great.<//review>

<Review>If the pictures don't convince you, maybe words will: these guys are GREAT! The design consultation that Krister provided helped me create a space that I could not have envisioned, much less created, on my own, and the end result was EXACTLY as he drew it up. Actually, it was better, because I had two last-minute ideas that the installers, Mark and Carlos, were perfectly flexible and happy to implement. They exceeded my expectations with their helpfulness, promptness, and friendly customer service. All my friends and neighbors, besides being jealous, are asking me to help them organize their garage, and I have to admit that I can't take the credit.<//Review></record>

Jay and Marc and the team at Organized Garage Solutions transformed our garage into a place we want to spend time in! We had a large crack running down the middle of our garage floor that they were able to easily fill and smooth. They worked promptly, helped me choose design, and were very attentive throughout the whole process. I highly recommend Organized Garage Solutions for anyone looking to improve the look and feel of their garage for years to come! And as they guarantee their work, you never have to worry about it again! Thanks Jay and Marc and OGS!<//Review>

<Text>I've had these guys install cabinets, shelves and a rack in my one car garage.  They were professional, efficient and timely throughout the whole process. They offered clear planning including 3D renders, they offered options without being pushy.  The job was done in a few hours, I didn't have to be home. The final product looks great, would definitely use them again.<//Text>< name>

Did a good job.  Showed up on time.  All looks good.
Could've planned some things a bit better as one of the selves ended up in an unusable place, and they charged me to have this fixed.  Also were suppose to get back to me with a quote for soft closing hinges, and I never heard back.<//Review>

Just purchased and installed Polyuria Floor System and Monkey Bar System from these guys. From the start I was impressed with the professionalism and time and advice provided by Jay who drove out to provide a free estimate and full rendering of what my garage would look like based on the designs discussed. There was no sense of “salesman” or push to get the deal done at all (which I experienced with other companies). The products sell themselves. The rendering provided the same/next day and detailed estimate allowed someone like me who didn’t have much knowledge of flooring and shelving systems to feel confident in the product I was purchasing but it was the extremely reasonable price and customer service that sold me. Working with Jay was easy and he responded quickly on all my inquiries and adjustments. I was scheduled for a 2 day job within the week which was a huge plus for me. I was already confident with what I was getting myself into but the crew for the floor (Victor and Dustin) and crew for the monkey bars (Marc and team) blew me away with their workmanship and professionalism. Both teams arrived promptly at 7:30am despite the long commute to my house ready to work and review with me their plans for the day. They were in and out with no fuss and cleaned up after themselves leaving me with a transformed garage that I just LOVE! Seeing the high quality finished product and quick turn around these guys provided along with excellent customer service and satisfaction honestly will make me a customer for life despite all the other choices out there. These guys are simply the BEST with what they do and I am proud and beaming at my new garage so much so I leave the garage door open just to show off how clean and organized it looks now. I HIGHLY recommend these guys to anyone considering a change for their garage. You won’t be disappointed.<//Review>

<Text>Jay and his team did a wonderful and top rated makeover to our garage, to include, flooring , wall cabinets and work station for my husband and son. His crew is very punctual, polite, kind and ethical. Brian and David are detail oriented, very knowledgeable of their trade and very professional. The end result is a showcase which we are very proud of. The  garage is looking great, beyond par and second to none. I give a 10 so , here's 5 more stars.....

You will wish your garage was your living room!  The organization of our garage was a perfect project from beginning to end. Jay, so professional and knowledgeable, listened to our needs, made suggestions we never thought of and provided us with one of the best rooms in our house, the garage!!
His company uses the best materials at a great price, and stayed true to the expected completion date.  (The monkey bars ceiling storage are a must!). Thank you Jay and Organized Storage Solutions!< /text>

Way, way overpriced for about 7 feet of wall cabinets in a garage + a 4 foot metal shelf next to them costing over 2k.< /Review>

<review>My garage looks and functions so much more efficiently as a result of AAA. I really appreciated the creativity of this team to use both the Monkey Bars and hanging racks to solve my storage issues. I have a relatively small garage, but can now fit both my cars AND easily access my skis, 2 bikes, golf clubs and beach chairs.</review><date>1618195960363<//date></record>

Jay was very helpful in the planning stages- and very flexible since I wasn't sure how much storage I would need until I could see it up.  He gave me a fair quote, and let me adjust as the job was being done.  The team was on time and very professional.  Highly recommend!!< /Review>

Had a great experience. These guys did the floor on my one car garage, as well as installed a flip-up workbench. Nice guys, professional work, loved the final product. Would recommend to anyone looking to make their garage as nice as their own bedroom - assuming they have a nice bedroom.<//Review>

Jay listened to what we thought we wanted, drew up some initial plans and returned to discuss them. With color renditions of the project we were able to very quickly realize some changes were needed. The quote for the desired work was extremely fair and reasonable.  The Crew and the install team showed up to install and build out the cabinets on the appointed day on time and thoroughly cleaned up when finished. Without hesitation we highly recommend Organized Garage Solutions for any project you may have.  The team comprised and produced a HIGH quality result.  In every respect they genuinely are professionals.< /text><name>Aras Akbari< /name><rating>5< /rating><Date>1512063789302< /Date>< Resp>

I love my garage overhead shelving. The entire team (sales and installation crew) were professional. The shelving was up and ready to use in 6 hours. I have a 3-car garage and I had shelving placed around the walls, along with utility racks for tools and bike.  It was the best decision and now my garage looks like it did when I moved in 28 years ago - clean and organized. Don’t buy outdoor sheds. Also, company is very honest. They had calculated a couple of installation bars too many which weren’t needed. They called ME to let me know and REFUNDED the money immediately.<//review>

<text>Local neighborhood market and liquor store with a great selection of house hold essentials wine and spirits. They do carry limited produced and also have a mexican restaurant inside that isn't half bad. The isles are always stocked and you can find some great deals at this lucky retailer!

They carrier a wide variety or snacks and also craft, domestic and international beer. Aside from the good service I love that they always have Celsius sports drink in stock.

Parking is super easy with plenty of room to get in and out from Hazletine and/or Burbank Blvd.<//text>< gmapID>

<text>I went into the store around 730pm. When I was in the store, I observed one male customer, two female customers and a child in the store. None of the customers had face coverings on inside the store. All others stores i have been to, customers had face coverings on. This store chose profits over safety. I will NEVER go to this store again. I will take my business elsewhere.</text>< username>

<text>A large variety of beer, Hard alcohol, wine and Gatorade and Rockstar types of drinks.
Very friendly staff. And on the east side (inside) is a hot food area where you can order tacos, plates, and other tasty foods to go or eat in. Very friendly cook and quick!< /text>< pictures>

<resp>None</resp><Name>Valli Aman< /Name><review>This place generally has what I need for last minute items and they also have a well stocked liquor department with all different sizes from very tiny to regular size and even though I'm not much of a drinker once in a while I just wanna buy a very tiny bottle which might be half a pint I don't know for $2.98… the guy that owns the place is very nice and because I'm on a Walker very often they help me. I think it's a great corner store</review></record>

Probably the best selection of craft beers in the entire Valley.  Full liquor store, decent "Dale's Jr." market, excellent in-store Mexican restaurant, easy parking.<//Review>

DO NOT GET FOOD FROM THE INSIDE RESTAURANT, i order a burrito the attendant told me she was going to make it so i decided to grab something from the store while waiting in less than 5 min, three tops, she went from grilling some meat to having my burrito ready, chips were soggy, small salad seemed old & burrito itself seem old, try calling the place but i couldn't find it on yelp, grubhub or any where else... but harvest market two thumbs up.........<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>, The new owner has changed quite a bit it's more upscale definitely a place to go to get what you need reminds me of the true Dales junior but it's now harvest market. And they have a wonderful selection of anything you need< /Text>< Resp>

<review>AVOID USING YOUR DEBIT CARD AT ALL COSTS HERE. ONLY USE CASH. TWO times already, my card has been scanned & duplicated here by some loser that's in the parking lot when you're filling up & paying at the pump. how do I know it's this place? I ONLY use a certain card for gas, it's always after I put gas at this specific gas station. Please be cautious, they take EVERYTHING in ur account.< /review><user_id>107766934433072501538</user_id><gmapID>0x80db43e5c26d160b:0xa7c16bd034bb1ebe< /gmapID><rate>2< /rate>< username>

Good for work attire but man do these sweats fall apart way too easy.  And color bleeds out after 1 washing. I was expecting better quality at 20 bucks a pop. I'll just stick to Ross, thanks!<//Review>

You can find anything from school shirts and pants, to jackets, hoodies,  belts, and jackets. They carry big sizes so this is definitely the place if your child is tall</Text>

<Text>This place is ALWAYS incredible. A bad meal at Mae's beats the best meal almost everywhere else! And in the past 13-14 years...I have never had a bad meal.

I typically settle on breakfast...I love the Lyonnaise potatoes option. However 75%+ of the time I get Mae's Manly breakfast. No other spot has this...and if they did, they wouldn't do it as Manly as Mae!

Love this place!!!<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>Food: 3 Stars - Food was good (Tijuana Scramble, Hash & Eggs, Sampler). It is what I would expect from your average dinner.
Service and Cleanliness (+1 Star): Service was good, friendly and attentive. Cleanliness was spot on and saw them disinfecting surfaces, including door handles multiple times.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoDeMJBl9GqjuVwLNV8STcx5XZAVIlvtq0x4WK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9LnjOrh69g4U1B3r7wZ6oVKfwHjYJpTKSs0sf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

This was my first visit to Mae's and definitely won't be my last!  It was a toss-up between the Cobb Salad & a cheeseburger, the cheeseburger won out this time.  The cheeseburger was delicious & our waitress was very friendly & accommodating!< /Text>

I really love coming here with my friends. The food is good (as good as any diner food you can get), but we come here mostly for the atmosphere and the friendly staff! The hosts are always friendly and make sure you are comfortable. The shakes here are really good too! We would regularly visit here at odd hours like 3am before the pandemic. I hope we get a vaccine soon, so that Mae's can go back to being 24hrs again! I really miss the staff and the midnight atmosphere.< /text>

<Review>Before my friend and I were seated outside, I noticed the tables and chairs was very dirty. That was my sign to run but my friend insisted on eating there. The waiter cleaned them up but I felt they should've been cleaned before we arrived. You're having customers eat outside your establishment. I ordered a Cobb salad. The eggs were not cooked and the avocado looked unsafe to eat. I ask for a take home container for my friend and it was filthy. I gave them 2starz because the waiter was pleasant.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><user>102290841262374211596<//user><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Good food, affordable, nice portions, welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. The chicken fried steak was insanely tender and juicy, and the Tijuana Scrambled was a great combination of flavors. The biscuits and gravy was just mediocre, mostly cuz it's not sausage gravy, but that's the only "complaint" we had - the flavor of the rest of the food more than made up for it. Even at around 2:30, there was still plenty of traffic coming into the place, so I imagine this place is quite busy during peak hours. Would definitely recommend!<//Text>

Not a bad place for brunch. While there, someone got the T-bone steak and eggs. The aroma was so appetizing I got one myself. Ordered the steak medium rare but came out more on the medium side could be due to the hot plate. Biscuits and gravy were really good compared to others places. My friend got a hot links plate and eggs. Hot links were good too.<//text>

<text>I was with friends a few weeks ago and they decided to stop and get something to eat. It was lunch time and I had never eaten here before. I ordered pasta with a little extra sauce and a salad. The food was very good. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was a generous portion. My pasta was hot and had plenty of sauce. The lunch was filling and put a smile on my face. I left happy and was glad they decided to stop at Mae's Cafe.<//text>< Resp>

A very good place to eat food delicious service was fabulous and very friendly. She gave us refills and we didn't have to ask. We will return here whenever we can .

Had Sirloin Steak n Eggs, with home fries & toast.  The Steak, which I asked for to be cooked Medium, was tough as  shoe leather & not tasty. The scrambled eggs were good, as well as the home fries & the toast. I  THINK, we will try again and get waffles, or French Toast.<//review>

This place has the BEST Turkey club sandwiches! Apparently the cooks make all their turkey in house so its like having a turkey sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. We usually come here about twice a month just for that. 😁<//text>

Great coffee shop open 24 hours. The food is really good, especially the Tbone steak served on a sizzling platter. The waitresses are friendly and very efficient and helpful. We are definitely will be coming back.< /review>

This was one of our favorite meals in Maine! Delicious Brussels sprouts hash! Very good food and quick service. Crowded but worth the wait. We bought a giant Whoopie pie and took it with us to Acadia- it was so delicious hours later. Highly recommended !<//Review>

<review>Came in for dinner on Easter. It wasn't extremely packed, but the tables were getting filled up. We were seated, but waiters didn't come to ask about drinks until 10 minutes later and didn't come to ask about food until 20 minutes later. A party of 6 came in at the same time we did and they left soon after drinks were given to them cause the wait was so long. Food also took long to come out. Their food was just average. Nothing too special. I had ordered medium rare steak and it came out barely cooked on the inside, still completely raw. And hash browns weren't cooked completely as well. I've been to this restaurant for years and even more so lately cause my friend chooses this place as his go to when we want to dine in later in the evening. But this was the worst experience we've had.< /review>< Pics>

I give Mae's Cafe located at 9062 Trask Ave, Garden Grove, CA 92844 FIVE STARS. This place has been my go to place for many years. MAE'S offers great meals 24/7 and a welcoming experience each time I've gone. They are known for their sizzling steaks that are topped off with a DELICIOUS butter.  Make sure to order a John Wayne special  and add biscuits smothered with a bunch of gravy.</Text>

Only on very rare occasions did I get food tasting worse than my expectations. They serve breakfast anytime. I ordered Eggs Benedict last night and it was better than expected. Lots of ham piled up and eggs were poached perfectly. Hollandaise sauce was creamy and consistent in texture. Potatoes and onions were a perfect complement and literally finished everything on plate with a nice bowl of fruit which I just ended up taking home. I would choose this place over Denny's if ever given the choice if I had to compare with a similar restaurant.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

A great place to eat and go back in time. We felt like we were in an old diner in Vegas!!
Their style potatoes is great and the steak should be ordered medium rare, since it still sizzles when it gets to you.
We went there at 2am and the waitresses were still smiling.
We will go back to try other dishes.<//Text>

Great comfort food. I go here fairly often. Waitresses are always nice and the food is good and very reasonably priced. Last time we went here we had a fairly new server named Madison who did a fabulous job, was very attentive, and made some great recommendations which were perfect. You guys need to keep her around cuz she's a great asset to your team</review>

Well...it was quite an experience to try this place. First impression not good, entering one of the waitresses told me that considering it was just me, I should be seated at the counter, because they were extremely busy, so I did precisely that.
After 10 minutes seated and looking how waitresses and busboys passed by without even looking at me, call the attention of 1 of the waitress and she finally gave me a menu.
Decided just to have a malt and an appetizer, considering that supposedly they were extremely busy, glad I did just that, because for my small order it took them 20 more minutes to just give me the appetizer I order and apologies from the waitress, because she couldn't prepare my malt, instead she gave me ice tea for the inconvenience.
After I finished my appetizer, she finally got time to prepare my malt, but not the one I ordered previously, but just a vanilla one, when I ordered butterscotch, so quite a different flavor.
Finally noticed that there was a very nice couple that arrived about 10 minutes after I did at the end of the counter, who were still waiting for their food when I was leaving, so that gave me the correct impression, that or they are lacking personnel or definitely there's a bigger problem between the service and the kitchen, to create such an awful delay like this, between orders.
Definitely and quite sure, I won't be back at least for quite awhile or until I heard better reviews from someone else!!!</Review>

The food is your good old diner standard fare. Good selection. Big portions. And the prices are hard to beat. Far from elegant and maybe not the best kept up place, but they keep things clean and consistent.<//review>

coming here early to grab some omelettes has been great. the server was quick and the food came out fast. if im passing by i know where to come for some 24hr spot. their home potatoes are highly recommended.

Over the years it's lost its heart and charm that made it such a wonderful diner.  The familiar faces are gone as well as their loving and warm service.  The new people working here don't seem to care as much which is unfortunate but they do their job well.

Food is as good as it gets for late night diners, I recommend the country fried steak and eggs! It remains consistent and delicious.  Occasionally I get the sizzle skillet steak which tastes great! But I feel I lose a bit of value with it's pricing.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

It's a family restaurant, with homemade meals, simple but tasty. Service is friendly and quick. A lot of locals come here to eat, open 24 hours. We always enjoyed our dinners here.< /Text>

Staff usually stay on for a long time so that shows it is run well.  Open 24/7 which is definitely good when you have some crazy late night need for a meal.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I don't know where to start. The food it's great. Fast service and a lot of food for little money. I like coming here with my wife and have a nice conversation while we enjoy our delicious food. It is a cozy place, takes me out of my regular routine. When im there i feel like i am in a different town close to the mountains.</review>

Best fresh breakfasts in Orange County. Ruby is the best waitress. She is the reason we visit Mae's. Ruby is fast, attentive and not intrusive during your meal. Always ask to be seated in her section.< /review>

Lady staff wasn't very helpful. Seemed to be bothered. Not busy but still had to remind her for my toast order +remind for to go box. Hmm? Food is Basic. Nothing to exciting. Breakfast is Basic. But hey open 24hrs. Parking is good. Needs a update.<//text>

<text>I have tried almost every American style diner in the Westminster area, and this is the best I have found. Mae's has quality food, breakfast served any time, and good portions. Two unique items that caught my eye right away were a corned beef benedict and that they have cherry pie regularly.<//text><date>1536277649097</date><gmap_id>0x80dd287ffadf6c11:0x8463434eac1577a3<//gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

Mae's Cafe has great comfort food that comes out in big portions @ a reasonable price. My family & I have been coming here for years & we've yet to have anything we didn't really like. They are always open & the staff are all very nice. My favorites here are the Ground Round Steak loaded with grilled onions & mushrooms, the Liver & Onions loaded with lots of grilled onions & the Eggs Chelsea Benedict because I love corned beef hash & hollandaise sauce! The men in my family tend to go for the Steak & Eggs or the Porterhouse. Check it out!<//Text>

Food was good. Prices were good. Service, not so much. We were seated fairly quickly & given menus. After that, we were apparently invisible. The waitress for our table started clearing the one next to us, sat people at that table, gave them menus & took their order, without even acknowledging us.

Once she finally got around to taking our order, it went well. We were served our main plates, then we had to flag down the waitress for anything & everything after that & EVERY SINGLE THING, from missing silverware to coffee & water refills, creamer, sugar, jelly, ranch dressing, etc..... were plopped on the edge of the table as she walked past. VERY  UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!

We are not needy customers, but we do expect proper restaraunt service to go along with our meal (& we tip accordingly). Isn't that half the point of going out to eat?

If we ever do give them another try, we will request a different waitress.< /text>

<text>We waited a while to be served and our party was served food at differant times. Waitress was new we understood that but the day we were there three people kept going in and out. One was in the bathroom for almost an hour while the other was banging on the door telling her to get out or he will break the door down.  Wasn't pleasant and hopefully this isn't a daily occurrence. I probably won't go back. Food was okay.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>One possibly positive possibly negative thing I can say about Mae's is they're open 24 hours a day. While I truly appreciate anyplace that serves food on my insomniac schedule I'm not entirely sure if the risk is worth the reward. I am not implying I got sick or anything bad happened but if you're going to be open 24 hours a day and say on every page of your menu "all items available all day" it would be great if you could at least try to live up to that. I tried to order a Dinner entree item at 4:00am. The very nice waitress informed me there is no soup, salad and most of the sides are unavailable at that hour. I ordered the fried chicken and it was served in a styrofoam container. At one point I think I ate a piece of the container by mistake. I say I think because I honestly couldn't tell the difference in taste if I tried. About the only thing I would say about the two is I think the container would have satisfied my hunger more than the chicken did.</review><Time>1541419720521<//Time><resp>None</resp>< Pics>

<text>Food is good depending on chef cooking that day. The waitresses on the other hand are the most rude and scandalous. There is an Asian waitress (I'm not racist) who always has the worst attitude and even though she see that some of the food is not acceptable she will still serve it. My last trip there I checked my receipt only to find out she tried to tip herself about 30 dollars!? If i didn't review my receipt before paying she would've gotten away with it (damn cake face snake) and on top of that her manager tried to back her up and they were trying to force the tip on me telling me it was mandatory to tip!?< /text>< Pictures>

Who is the waitress?! She always looked like she hated her job, so unprofessional!! I don't know why she always stands and watches the cooks making our food giving them attitude and impatiently waiting. Last time she barely acknowledges us and when she does she has an attitude like she doesn't want to do her job. I even had dirty utensils on the table. Last time I asked for water, she gave me HOT water, then when I told her I wanted cold water she gave a look like "why didn't you say so" kind of look. I don't know how is she still working here. Does nobody not say anything to her or about her? Do they fear her? I wouldn't be. I wouldn't even want to come back to that unpleasant behavior she has. All the other waitresses are fine with smiles on their face and being very helpful and know that we customers are actually there. Someone please knock some sense into the other lady or replace her PLEASE. I know I'm not the first person who ever encountered this issue. Anyway, she was a tall thin lady perhaps in her 40s. Some of the food is good and some did not much have any flavor..but other than that, I don't think I would come here again until you guys get better staff.< /text>

The staff is always friendly here. This place is great for late night cravings, especially after a night of booze. I highly recommend the porterhouse steak and eggs with extra crispy lyonnaise potatoes. Mae, whoever you are, you're the best!<//text>

<review>5:38 AM I came in sat down got my order taken. Then a man came in 3 minutes after, sat down got his food before me. My steak came out, the waiter came by to ask he could borrow my A1 just for a minute to give the guy that came in after me, never return my A1. so i had my food after him and now having my steak without A1 because of him. Sitting there thinking WTF the whole restaurant only have 1 A1 bottle to pass around.  Terrible experience, only if i just wait for 30 more minutes then other restaurants will open. I will go home with a smile and a full stomach. I always tips 20%-30% but this time my check was $15.18 i tip $1. I was thinking to put 82 cents for tip.</review>< Response>

The food is well seasoned. Service is a bit hit and miss and they have new staffs often. The butter on the waffle is ridiculously delicious. The sizzling skillet will cook the steak more than ordered and makes a mess so I usually just ask for my steak on a plate. Large portion.< /Text>

<Review>Had a late lunch there with my friends 3 adults 3 kids.. 2 highchairs 1 booster. The waitress was super patient and had alot of fun talking to the kids. And the waitress helped out with *a kidsmeal* order not on the menu. A collection of al a carte items. Super tasty. If you didnt know this place was in SoCal on a busy street next to a In N' Out...its ez to think you are in a old school cafe *good ppl good food and great coffee!!

The waffle was thin and crunchy tasted like it was a day old waffle. The BLT was asked with sourdough bread and it was just white bread which was also stale< /Text>

The best thing about Mae's is the late hours. The food is ok, but quality of preparation varies, and it is rarely wonderful. It is a reasonable price. The service varies widely.< /Text>

This place is bar none the best place to get a good meal for a good price any time of day or night.   Anyone who didn't like this place is the reason that we creep ever closer to a totalitarian corporate oligarchy, devoid of happiness, freedom, and food that doesn't come from a tube.< /review>

<Name>Sonny Dong</Name><resp>None</resp><Review>Had a very bad experience here. Came in with a group of 6 people. Got seated and  waited for 15 minute; no menu and no service. Walked up to the counter and asked for the menu and why there's no waiter assisting the table while other table are getting service. Got an apology for not realizing the group was seated and another apology for assuming there would be additional people coming, when clearly, I stated 6 people and was told to sit at the particular table. Afterward waited for 10 more minute to receive the menu. Long story short there's a lot more issue but to long to write it all out. The food is decent, but service was beyond horrible.< /Review></record>

Maes is a classic American restaurant. Good food that's open 24/7 365days. Can't complain because it's way better than norms and dennys<//review>

This is my 30th year as a loyal customer.  With so many years, I have seen a thing or two at this reztaurant, but they strive to make right.  Fyi, try their fajita platter.  It is to die for.< /Review>

This place Rocks. I've been coming here ever since when my real good friend R.I.P Jack Dunigan. Introduced me to their 2:00am breakfast specials as well as the porter house steak with laonase potatoes with their secret sauce. The only thing I let you know, if you want real good OC Dinner fit for a king or queen. Make sure you bring a empty stomach...</text>

Until today I have had wonderful meals at Mae's Cafe, however, I just finished paying for a meal that I didn't get to eat with my friend as my order came and was totally wrong so I had to wait longer for my meal to come and my friend gracefully waited as well so his meal was cold when we did eat. I am disappointed and disgusted with the service and the food so much so, that I will not come here again.< /Text>

Very pleased they took The Godfather off of the menu, was a complete abomination of a sandwich. Prices went up a tad but the quality to price ratio is still pretty dead even. Great job Mae's< /review>

It's not what it used to be but if you're hungry and there's no place else to go and you don't feel like going to Denny's again, it's okay. I stopped going to this restaurant when he decided to turn off the Wi-Fi. lots of people hung out here when he had Wi-Fi. The one they turned it off a lot of people didn't come back like me.
I sure do wish it was like it was before.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I was recommended this place from a friend and I had heard about it and thought it would be good for 24 hour late night food I've only been twice the food was terrible not cooked well and overpriced for a $9 burger that was not cooked right and have basically no taste it was terrible. Second time I went with a friend and she didn't like her food either if they cook the food properly it might actually be better but hard to tell. Never been back too pricey to take chances on bad food.< /Text>< pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>I have been coming to Mae's since I was a kid back when it was Jon's coffee shop, for those ignorant cry babies who complain about the interior look, that is part of the theme of this place the southern diner look it is what makes it so homely. The food I love the chicken grilled fajitas they are delivered hot on skillet, chicken Cesar salad is awesome, french dip, chicken club sandwich all good breakfast is good especially considering the price you pay.  Waitresses are really nice and I know them well for the most part some people will never be satisfied no matter what can I say.  I will continue coming here for as long as I can.</Text>< userid>

My first night there, from that little open window where the kitchen is, i saw the chef scratching his back with one of the spatula. Another night, my friend ordered a salad and while he was eating it, he found parts of the wrapper that the lettuce came in. That same night, i ordered fried chicken and while i was eating it, both my friend and i realized that it still had blood in it. Ontop of that, their butter for bread was outdated and tasted moldy. Worst food experience at a diner i've ever had.<//Review>

So me and my sister, looking for a new place to have dinner. I was kind of curious of this restaurant next to in n out burger so, we decided to stop and we order. My sister order the turkey dinner and me just a beach burger. My burger was ok , not so impress very plain. My sister's turkey dinner suck big time her turkey was super dry , sorry chef regardless of all the heavy gravy you put in it !!!! She could tell that it was not fresh and so hard to chew ! ! And forget the stuffing !!! It almost look like a bread pudding!! My sister complain to the server and the only thing he said was, that she had already ordered and that next time she should order gravy on the side and gave her the check. Sucks the first impression on this restaurant!! Sorry server there will not be a next time.<//text>

A bad excuse for a dinner, terrible
food even a sandwich was dripping oil ,with wet bread.
Decor is dark, dinghy, worn and
very old looking ,not a pleasant experience. Nothing is ever fresh.< /Text>
