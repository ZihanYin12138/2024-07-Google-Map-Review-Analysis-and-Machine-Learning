Super fun experience to have an awesome RV delivered to my race and be able to stay at the track the whole time instead of a hotel! It was like having a home at the track. The RV was really nice and clean, and Andy and his crew were there anytime we needed anything. He was a cool guy and even wished me luck at my races, and checked on how I did during our stay. Andy is a great guy, and his RV was so awesome!! Can’t wait until the next race down there when we can do it again!< /text>

<Review>These people are soooooo nice!  They were knowledgeable, friendly and so accommodating.  The  campers we rented were very clean and functioned perfectly.  If you looking to rent an RV this is a fabulous place to go, we went to there yard to take a look at a few option and different sizes RV's and they showed use all the requested RV's before we booked it.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Amazing experience!! First time ever renting an RV, and Andy took great care of us!! Here are just some if the ways First Class RV Rentals made this an exceptional experience:
- Andy was very patient with our complete lack of knowledge of all things RV, and took the time to make sure we knew how to work everything
- The RV was already set up & ready for us to walk in the door when we arrived with all of the linens & kitchen items stocked, as well as basic necessities
- The RV was very clean, beautifully maintained & in immaculate condition, everything worked perfectly throughout our 6 day stay
- He was always available, 24/7 when we had questions or needed help
- The staff was very helpful determining which RV would best suit our needs, and made the choice easy, all done via email. When we arrived, the RV was exactly as described

We highly recommend First Class RV Rentals, and will definitely be renting from Andy again soon!</Review>

<text>First Class (Andy) made my first time RV renting experience extremely easy and very pleasant.
Andy made it easy for me to book (last minute/day of my trip to be exact) and even waved misc fees. Andy was very helpful and professional despite being overwhelmed with work. I can say with certainty that I will use First Class for all my future RV experiences! Keep up the awesome work Andy! See u soon 🍻<//text>< pictures>

This place is a diamond in the rough. I have been renting the same style RV for the last 3 years. Every year this company impresses me. Very accommodating with the best prices around. No hassle with high quality staff members. I would recommend anyone who is interested in renting an RV to check out First Class Rv Rentals before any place else.<//Text>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,  ANDY IS A CRIMINAL.  We hired a RV from this company over 2 months ago which had an operational fault at time of pick up.  Every effort was made to fix the problem, however we were given the choice of taking the unit as is (with a portion to be refunded because of the fault) or not to take it at all.  We opted to take it as we had no choice.  Now, not only have they not returned the deposit and partial refund, they will not answer phone calls or return emails.  If you are thinking of using this company - think again.  You won't get your deposit back.  We intend on communicating this to as many people as we can - especially our Burning Man family.<//Text>

<Review>First Class RV Rentals has always been a great company to work with. I have been using them for the last 5 years and they always meet my expectations and are understanding about drop off and pick up times. If you're looking to rent some of the best units out on the market, these guys got you covered.<//Review>< pics>

I am the owner of the Springdale unit that Andy rents. He has not paid me since begening this year and it has been rented out multiple times over the year. He refuses to contact me. I pay the monthly payments and insurance and he makes money from my RV. I have also been contacted by multiple other RV  owners who have not been paid. Andy needs to pay all the RV owners for the use of their RVs.....  Watch out when you do business with this company.< /text>

<username>Crystal Hernandez< /username><Date>1573266281497</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Horrible horrible horrible!!! Do not rent from here if you have a planned trip bc you will be let down! I scheduled my trip back in September and never could talk to anyone after I sent all my info but was verbally told do not worry our trip is set. Andy the owner will leave you hanging and never return calls. He claims he’s in “meetings” first off it’s not even that type of business and secondly meetings are not 3 months long. We rented from him before and we witnessed how other people were treated  and I guess we got lucky then. He goes through employees by the day and you never talk to the same secretary. Not to mention his prices are way outrageous and I got a brand new RV for our trip from RVShare that is 8 years newer and is gorgeous for way less and my payment is secure!  I had 5 different families for our trip originally planning on booking through them but they kept getting the run around and had a bad feeling. I was not going to risk my families trip they look forward to bc you verbally said it was a “go” but I can’t get you to return a single call or email. The negative reviews on here are 100% accurate< /Review>< Pics>

The staff are friendly, and the class-c unit we rented was in good shape, clean, and operated without incident. We also informed them about our intent to bring our pet, and while we did have an additional deposit needed, before we returned the vehicle we cleaned up the unit and received our full deposit back. It’s clear why this location is rated highly on yelp as well. If your debating whether or not to go with one of the larger national corporate companies to rent your RV, or First Class RV. Use First Class RV! Hands down the customer service at First Class RV is way better, units and the overall experience better.<//review>

I would give zero stars but it will not let me. We are the owners of the Nitro XLR and Andy has refused to return it like requested and agreed upon when we first started this rental process. Now he has ignored all calls, texts and emails regarding our camper and last 2 months of income. Our camper was supposed to be returned mid-May and is still not here. AVOID doing business here. Not to mention when he dissolved Abs Rv rentals his ex wife was living in our camper and we were making NOTHING on it and were not contacted until I asked what was going on.</Text>

<text>I have used Andy / First Class Rentals for 4 different RV's over about 6 years for our large desert trips, and could not be happier. Delivery, picking up, dumping and cleaning all taken care of....made every trip so easy. I have only had 1 issue, with a generator...and Andy had a repair man come out and changed the carburetor on a holiday weekend within hours. Homerun! Good clean units every time, and Andy and his team are so accomodating...they go above and beyond to make sure their customers have a great experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1528384225168<//Date>< Rate>

<Text>*DO NOT RENT FROM THESE CROOKS*
I would give negative stars if possible
After booking with these crooks, I read the reviews and I was hoping and praying the bad reviews were isolated incidents and that I would be one of the more fortunate ones, everything I previously read was true and happened to me! The good reviews have to be left by him or people he knows, First off the owner ANDY, is a straight loser, he appears nice, helpful and accommodating when you are booking your reservation, but that's just so he can get your money, I booked a reservation in July and left a $500 deposit to secure it, I called every week for 3 weeks up until the date of our trip to ensure that everything would be ready, cause once again I read the reviews, THE DAY that we were suppose to pick up the RV I received a call from Rose, the receptionist, stating that our bed was broken and would not fold (we had rented a toy hauler and needed the bed to fold in order to get the bikes in) and she said she could just issue a refund, I informed her that this was a family trip that was planned well in advance and we had kids that were anticipating on going and could not be disappointed, so canceling was not an option, nor being able to find another unit on such short notice, We were finally able to speak with the owner ANDY, and he reassured us that he would have the bed fixed the next day even though this now delayed our trip a day, I called before I get there to make sure repairs were made and he told me they still had not been done, we had no other choice but to pick up anyway, we get there and now the TV isn't in it which is what we paid for, we had to go back and forth with him until he finally said one of his workers would go "find one" and install it, we finally take the unit and find out during our trip that the heat didn't work, upon returning, I called Rose to let her know we would be coming back late, she told us to leave the unit on the grounds with keys inside, which I was not all comfortable doing due to all of the shady events that had already transpired, and there would be no one there to do a walk thru, We returned first thing in the morning, had a walk thru done, told everything was fine, and that my deposit would be refunded in 2 days, when I still didn't receive my refund I called Rose who informed me that ANDY would be calling me back, he told me that he WOULD NOT, be refunding me my money back because I kept the rental for 2 extra days, which wasn't true and even at $160 a day still doesn't add up to my $500 deposit and that the slide was inoperable which was never determined at the time of the walk thru, ANDY is a straight racist criminal business owner, this company looks like a straight trailer park dump, don't be deceived by the nice website, google the address, and he has workers that live on the premises that look a lil "strange" and he uses their services in exchange for rent, he makes them slave over these units while he scams people to get the business, VERY unprofessional, I don't want anybody else to have the experience I did, call JR RV Rentals, they are a real business.< /Text><name>Alyse Hudson<//name><Date>1543525009956< /Date><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Absolutely the worst RV rental you can find. Booking was easy, until they decided the RV was unfit for a mountain trip, fine. They requote for double the original price, fine. But then the OWNER decided to cancel- a day before!!! I mean come on, at least give someone a few days to completely replan their trip. They are unreliable and lack any sort of communication. It's almost impossible to get a call back.<//review>< Pictures>

***TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!***

We reserved an rv that we wanted to take to stagecoach. We made our reservation with the owner Andy, paid our deposit,and was given confirmation several times. As our rental date neared we emailed again to sort out the details of how and where we were going to meet up.

I was informed by the secretary that we no longer had our reservation for the rv that we had booked and that the owner had decided to put us into a different RV without EVER telling us about it!! When I asked to be put back into the rv that we had originally reserved, we were denied because they had already booked it and were not willing to change their reservation because they “paid in full”

We asked to speak with the owner Andy to get this sorted out but he would not return or pick up ANY of my phone calls. After several days of dodged phone calls our reservation date was fast approaching. We decided that the owner was not willing to resolve our issue so we had to ask the secretary for our money back.

To this day Andy never acknowledged the situation or had the decency to even apologize for what had happened; not even when we saw him in his office to pick up our deposit.

I will definitely never do business with Andy again. There are much better businesses to support.<//Review>

Ruthie alone is worth 10 stars, and not just because we have the same name lol. The place is impeccably clean and well managed in a safe area. All of the staff I have interacted with has been phenomenal. The only thing I do not like about this place is that my bill went from $108 to $124 only 4 months after renting, and during a Pandemic no less. The reason I only took one star off for that, is the prices are very low to begin with, and Ruthie told me in advance to expect an increase based on the rental season, but hell 4 months? I would reccommend people rent here, but expect to pay more than that "low price very quickly"</Review>

This is not the first storage facility that I've used. I've been here for about a year. Both Ruth and Victoria are extremely friendly and always helpful. I only wish other businesses had people this friendly and professional. This place is not only very secure with security cameras everywhere, but it's also kept extremely clean. If you're in a position that necessitates renting storage space in the area, this is the place.< /text>

I have had storage in different places but this one is by far the best one. This review is for the GM Ruth. She is the best manager that I have ever encountered with.  She always on point with the property and anytime I ask her to do anything she is there right away. I'm sorry that I cannot say the same great things about the manager that was there on Sunday. I asked her to change the bulb on my new cube and the experience was weird. She removed the bulb and instead of stepping down to put the light bulb on the floor, instead she drops it as I was standing there.  After trying to replace it, she couldn't and blamed Ruth for not ordering the correct bulb. I found that to be very unprofessional and uncalled for. Ruth is very professional and always willing to help. This experience I had with this manager was different and next time, I will wait for Ruth to be there . When Ruth and I went to check out the space she noticed that it needed to be swept. The manager was in that area sweeping and Ruth asked her if she can please sweep the cube before I moved in. The managers face didn't look too thrill when Ruth asked her to do that. When I moved in the cube, there was webs on the corners and none of the corners were swept.<//text>

This is my second time having a storage at CubeSmart and both experiences have been excellent. Denise and Lisa were friendly, professional, and informative and provided the most pleasant customer service experience. Moving is stressful and they definitely made the process a little less painful, even when we underestimated how much stuff we had in our house and had to rent a second storage unit.< /text>

<Review>I work all over the country and I've had my 1953 GMC truck and a storage for my personal effects and furniture for 4 years now. The women who work there are wonderful. There names are Sol and Shawntel. When the cover I had on my truck became tattered they called me on the phone to tell me. And low and behold they repaired it for me!! totally unexpected and highly appreciated.
They have always looked out for me and my wife's belongings, and when I came back to Cali during hurricane Harvey I stopped by and rented a trailer to tow my old truck to Texas with me. I pulled it out the day after my rent payment had been collected for the next months rent on the truck. I didn't even think about that, and a couple days later Shawntel called me and said she was going to get me a refund check sent to my address in Texas!!
Storing at this facility has been a very Pleasant and great experience. I highly recommend it to anyone,  Kai</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Listing here pushes delivery service that doesn't exist. Forces users to sign up for "blizzfull", which is a scam. Called restaurant and was informed that delivery is not offered by restaurant.< /text>

Roman (the guys who helped) made sure our order was perfect and went the extra mile to make sure we had a perfect meal. The bbq short ribs were amazing! We also got the salad and French fries. So many places close early and thankfully he stays open late. Everything was clean and wonderful. We will back for sure.<//Review>< pictures>

I like this place! They give delicious meals, their menu is decent, The cook in that restaurant is a real pro, I love very much tasting all their food. The food is always good, the service towards the guests  is good. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was unhappy.  I highly recommend it.<//review>

<text>This restaurant is located in the heart of Glendale and is well decorated and unique.  The surfboards on the roof are eye-catching.  There are drinks and beer for sale here, the dishes are fresh, the taste is good, the meat has its own characteristics, and the workmanship is good, making people feel appetite.  The price is fair.< /text><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

So glad to have found these in LA. Not that Hawaiian food is hard to find, but prior to this, good Hawaiian food was quite difficult to find.  The moco loco and the macaroni salad are just amazing and I only wish they were better for you so I could rationalize having it a lot more often<//Text>

If it we're possible to give this location a negative star review, I would. Of all the L&L locations that I've eaten at over the course of about 20 years, this Glendale location is the worst. From the terrible customer service at the counter, to the food that we ordered. The Kalua pork was dry and tasted like it was left over from earlier on in the week. I didn't think anyone could screw up french fries...... They did. When I brought up the quality of the food that we had ordered to the manager (same guy who cooked the food), and gave him the opportunity to make things right. He really didn't give a damn about his customers.
Never eat here unless you like throwing your money away.</text>

Never eat here.. the manager on duty "Ruben" is very unprofessional. His staff got our order wrong and he didn't deal with the situation like a professional manager should've. He was belligerent and demeaning.< /text>

Open til late (10pm or 11pm depending on what day of the week), this is the go to spot for home style Hawaiian BBQ. With generous portions, you'll feel the Aloha spirit with every bite. Try the ever popular chicken katsu meal (w/ extra rice) and you'll immediately be hooked. Don't miss out on this place, brah. 😉</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The Glendale location is probably the best one of these that I've been to. It's still an L&L when push comes to shove, but the friendliness of staff, quality of the food (especially the Malasadas) and the cleanliness give it bonus points. The only downside is that it's in a strip mall like area with plenty of other places around no real street parking but there are paid for garages. If you're already visiting the Americana this place is very convenient to stop and eat at considering you're probably going to pass by at picking up your car.<//text>

Super small portions and WAY too much rice.  I feel very ripped off. Seafood combo was a joke.  I'll never eat there again. Crappy.</review>

I just went in, but the cost wasn't bad .... but the barbecue sauce used a little less soy sauce. The noodles are fresh. The chef doesn't seem to be motivated. Value for money is not bad.

특정한 날 대부분의 음식점이 문을 닫아 몇몇 오픈 음식점이 문전성시를 이루어도 손님 한명 없던 식당. 그냥 들어가 봤지만 가성비는 나쁘지 않았고 ....다만 바베큐소스는 간장을 좀 적게 사용했으면...다소 짜다. 면은 싱겁고. 주방장의 의욕이 없는것 같이보임. 가성비는 나쁘지 않다. 조금만 개선해 주시길....<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The wheel on my Dad's wheelchair came off and the inside of the leg was stripped. The medical supply stores nearby were closed so my husband said let's try Ace. They dropped what they were doing and helped us. Very nice people inside appreciate the great customer service and help fixing it!</Review>

As usual this store is wonderful.  Always willing to help resolve issues or help make choices.  My BBQ was assembled,  delivered and installed.  My newest purchased was a leaf vacuum.  Again assembled for me.  Small is so much better.< /text>

<Text>Great customer service. Mike spent a great deal of time to assist me an my wife finding the stuff we needed. When we found the type of screws we wanted, there were not enough of them in stock and had to pre-order the quantity we needed.
After two weeks I got a phone call they received them, and I picked them up with no problem. Good experience!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcd101b7197989:0x4d2d626ac7dffaf8<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I prefer Ace Hardware over the other hardware stores. More personable service. I brought some paint samples and ideas to the store. They gave me very good service and matched the paint. I am very pleased.< /Review>< pics>

<text>If I could rate this location zero stars I would. Went in to have a screen repaired and was rudely told it would take 7 to 10 days with a cost of $35 dollars. The man working in the department was sooo rude! I left and drove to Diamond Bar location and they repaired the screen right then, no wait time and they charged me $1!</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great go-to hardware store.  I find the prices aren't generally out of line and the knowledge of the personnel makes it worth it.  Today I brought my 8' sliding screen door there for re-screening and expected to leave it and come back, but they took it in the back and rescreened it on the spot while I watched!  Done in 20 min and total charge was $27!  Great service and a very reasonable price!  Mobile screen repair quoted me $100.</Review>

Getting my work truck detailed to sell... These guys did a great job.  It took a while (1 hour, 10 minutes) but the results were good.  Will definitely come back again.<//text>

Minus the wait time (yes they are currently under staffed) their attention to detail has always been great. The staff is always friendly and understands the expectations of the customer. Though today is a windy day and might not be as beneficial for a carwash our vehicle did need it after our most recent outing. Thank you Casino Carwash for always doing an amazing job.< /Review>

<Review>If I could give 0 stars I would. Absolutely shocked by the way the manager acted when I took my car. I called for the price to get my seats shampooed and was told it was 79.99. When I get there the "manager" Angel tells me that it's 140 because there's no way I can just get my seats shampooed, that I have to do the carpet as well. I tell him that I called and he told me he didn't care who I spoke to because what he says goes. He had the worst attitude and automatically got defensive. Will not be going back ever again!!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Everytime I go here my car comes out looking great. Today was exceptional, I went in and asked for a wax but told them I was on a tight schedule. They were very accommodating and had no less than 3 people working on my car at any given time. They got me out of there in 30 minutes and did not sacrifice the quality of my wash and wax! Thanks all</Review>< Pictures>

Had 2 people working on my car 👍🏼 it's lowered and they were very careful, one of the gentlemen got down to a push-up position even though there was soap and water on the ground to make sure my car didn't hit when entering the drive thru. They hand scrubbed it and did a great job. First time here and will definitely be back. I purchased the $29.99 wash but it was worth my money and time. The bathroom was clean, a huge plus and there was ac in the waiting area, even though I ended up waiting outside anyway. Thank you!</Review>< Pics>

Found multiple scratches and a dent on my brand new vehicle. I spoke to them about it and they denied their doing because of no proof.  Careless employees and manager. Sad they don't take accountability for their mistakes, never going back. If you do, walk around with them before and after wash.</Text>

This place is great!!! Affordable and they do a great job! I love this place the most because they don't mess with your stuff! I have tissues in my car for a reason and this is the ONLY place that doesn't throw them away. Customer service is perfect, they even let you lounge inside and the desk lady let's you know when the car is done. They've got snacks and beverages inside for purchase, but limited car supplies.</review>

As far as the car being washed and detailed, great job. Not kid friendly as they do not have changing tables in the restrooms. Had to change my daughter on the floor due to this. Make sure you mom or dad's carry a changing pad when coming to this location.<//Text>

<review>I’ve been here one time - so far. They did such a fantastic job on my truck. They are pricey, but I usually go to Corona, wait forever, and end up underwhelmed with the wash.
These guys and gals were very detailed to the point they actually cleaned the steps on my truck, not just wipe them off with a chemical that dries streaky. I’m hoping they’re still open today, I heard they were going to change management and I’m really hoping that doesn’t make the service suffer.<//review>< Pics>

I almost didn't go to this car wash yesterday bc of the bad reviews, I'm glad I decided to come inspite of so many bad reviews. The staff here is very friendly, the customer service was great. Their prices are very reasonable. They did a really really good job on my car today. My car was filthy on the inside & out. I was really embarrassed with the way my car looked. I got the Super Ultimate Hand Wash for $29.99 It looks like a brand new car & it smells really good too. I am very satisfied with the job they did on my car yesterday. I will definitely be back again.< /text>

<Time>1576441274978</Time><rating>1<//rating><Review>Just came to get my car washed while I waited on my husband. I wanted something simple so I got the deluxe car wash that's stated $17.99. The guy charged me for the Super car wash which was $20.99. I told him I just wanted the deluxe he then said, "Well you have more windows"? I told him what that doesn't make any sense. Mind you I drive a 2018 Nissan Rogue so didn't think my suv had any more windows than a normal car?? Don't like that they charge whatever they feel like. Just not right and will never come here again......< /Review>< pics>

Horrible. I only gave 1 star because zero is not an option.  We paid for deluxe as we had 1 spot on a seat needing removed and we were there from 10am until 1240 and the rim's are still dirty and there are water spots and dash is not even clean. We got so frusted we finally just left as the manager was not helpful in resolving the complaints. Do not recomend for ths price!!</Text>

<text>This car wash is excellent, they let me know right up front it will be a 45 min wait I totally appreciate that, they explained the rates didn’t try n sale us the most expensive one the rates were reasonable, the atmosphere is chill, Taco Bell is down the street we walked there grabbed a bite to eat came back the car was just about finish, when they finished the car it was absolutely beautiful !!! Clean in the inside and outside, when I went in I was hesitant due to all the negative reviews but I’m so glad I wanted to have my own experience, because I found a great car wash that I will continue to go to!< /text>< pictures>

<text>they washed the outside of my truck, but the inside was only cleaned 1/2 way just the front seats, the back seats were never even wiped down.
If I had not been in a hurry I would have checked it all, but I will not go back there again.<//text>< username>

Paid $30. To have a car wash.  !! Ridiculous.. !!! Then I leave only to find all the same spills on my doors inside, windows still covered in finger prints had to wash down dash before I left car wash. Dirt on back bumper, dead bugs still on front bumper.. just curios. And no one to complain to since they were closing and owner left. !!!  Will not use this car  wash ever again !!!

<text>Went to this place a few times and was never completely satisfied with the service but i was hopeful every time I’d go back. The 3rd time I went back I paid the 70 dollars and my windshield got 3 chips. Very unprofessional and didn’t try to make it right. I will never go back. I won’t recommend to anyone either.<//text>< response>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>BEWARE!!!! I was recently looking to get my headlights restored and I saw their ad in the newspaper and noticed that they do headlight restoration for $29.99. So I decided to give them a try. First of all, I sat and waited for over an hour! Then when my car came pulling up, I wasn't shocked on how they looked at all. It was just a MINOR improvement. They weren't even cleared up all the way at all AND I noticed a lot of scuffs on the headlights!! I was EXTREMELY disappointed. So I tried to get my money back for receiving such a horrible experience, and waited more, and never got a refund. I will never step foot in this place again. I would consider looking into getting them professionally done for a little more. You definitely get what you pay for!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Been going to this car wash quite a while went there today to get my truck cleaned I was unaware it was under new management I paid over $30 to get my truck cleaned in a piss poor manner my nine-year-old could've done a better jobI called to explain I was unhappy with their wash job and they explained to me that under the new management policies there and able to wipe down the door panels are your vehicle I told him that was pretty ridiculous I've had to pay extra for that and that they last a long time customer< /text>

Nothing like paying $35 for a car wash and having 7 employees sit and watch one guy dry my car for 30 minutes. Funny how all the signs say “under new ownership”. Apparently the new ownership cares even less than the previous. Won’t be back!<//review>

OK,this place is slow, but do a really good job. If you are trying to get a quick wash, this probably isn't the place for you, but if you have a little extra time, I think they do a good job on washing a vehicle.<//Text>

I have ALWAYS had a good experience here!!  They take their time no matter how busy they are.  They are polite and always greet me with a smile!!!  I refuse to go to any other car wash in L.E.  They are precise and cover every little detail.   I've paid more in OC and always drove away from there disappointed.  Very happy with the service here!!!!<//Text>

DO NOT TAKE YOU CAR HERE! I always give businesses a second chance, this is one time I wish I hadn't. Nothing has changed since my first visit, over priced and horrible service, I've gotten better car washes for $6 at the gas station drive thru wash.< /text>

Wow I'm so disappointed in what this carwash has become, there is a lobby full of people, about 20 vehicle's and about 6 employees. I've been here for about an hour and just saw my vehicle get vacuumed. 30 dollar wash. Wow I recommend any other carwash what a way to start the day. NEVER COME HERE PEOPLE IT'S NOT WHAT UT WAS 3 YEARS AGO</review>

This car wash used to be so good! Now it’s horrible. They don’t even wipe down your seats if you have leather unless you pay for a detail. And they try and upsell you on everything possible Ridley by the way. I never complain but I’d save your time and money and support a better business. I asked for the basic wash and the guy went and printed a ticket for a superwash trying to sneak and charge me more than what I asked for. Place is a joke and they’re rude. Won’t be back.< /Text>

AVOID AT ALL COST!!   Brought in our new suburban for a full service wash.  The wash was just "ok".  When we returned home we discovered the rear window defrost connection had be pulled from its soldered connection on the window.  However, "someone" had attempted to glue it back into place.  Took the car to the dealer who confirmed it was glued and would not function properly since a conductive connection is necessary for it to work.  It had been working perfect just days before during monsoon weather while on vacation at the river.  When we returned to the car wash, the owner (Larry), denied his business had anything to do with it and belittled me when I explained to him that we used it just days before in monsoon weather even if it was 100 degrees here.  Terrible service!  Go someone else.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Stay away from this place! I would give them a 0 if I could! Ok, let me start this off by saying that I am very picky when it comes to car detailing. When I wash my car myself, I spend at least 4 hours on it. I went here for convenience since lately I haven't had the time to give to washing my vehicle and someone said they do a decent job. I absolutely regret this decision! The interior of my vehicle is covered in a film. I'm not sure what this is since they claim they do not amoral the interior (which I have never armoraled my interior). My guess is they used the same microfiber from the exterior of my car on the interior.....huge No No! I now have to wash my hands after driving my car now that my steering wheel is covered in this mystery coating. In addition, I have high gloss black plastic components on my dash and doors panels that now have permanent scratches on them due to their carelessness, which is what upsets me the most. Then there's the vacuum job...they can't even get that right.  I have a manual transmission and the boot around my shifter still had the dust in it from when I brought it in and the cup holder wasn't touched.

Regarding the outside vehicle, all windows were water spotted and smudged. There was grime still splashed up on the side of my car (It's white so it's really easy to see). The inside of the door handles were still dirty. The front still had bugs smashed on it, and the black plastic didn't get armoraled here, just the back-end did. In addition, the wheels were still dirty anywhere the surfaced faced downward. Basically, the car needs another wash...I wish I hadn't been in a hurry so I could have been more observant and addressed the situation then.

Highly disappointed, I call the following day, Monday at 2:20 pm, to let them know how disappointed I was. No one answered so I left a voicemail with my contact information. I didn't get a call back, so I called again today, Wednesday at 2:17 pm. The girl who answered the phone was very nice and the only good thing about this whole situation. She let me know that the manager was not available but I could speak with the assistant. Well, as I should have expected that didn't go well. He started by answering the phone with a simple "hello" and didn't identify who he was, I had to ask who he was and for his name....unprofessional! BTW, his name is Angel. As I was letting him know about my car, he interrupted me! Not how I would treat my customers! However, he did offer to rewash my car, but what I was the most concerned about were the permanent scratches on my interior panels. Angel didn't even offer to look at the damage. He said that they were not liable since I didn't say anything when the car was done and before I drove off. So, I declined the free wash and now I'm letting all of you know what happened to me for I don't want you to end up in my shoes. If you're ok with less than mediocre results, then you'll be happy here. However, I have seen better results for less in a gas station drive through. I recommend staying away from this place, they don't care about the quality of their work and they don't care about their customers. It looks like this new management is no better than the old.

I would post some pictures for you, however,  I do not currently see how I can.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc9bbeec23464d:0x667bb7411e63f577<//Gmap_id></record>

<time>1373938553770<//time><rating>1<//rating><text>I was there just this past weekend. They wanted me to pay after they wash the car and told me the price is determined according to how dirty the car was! It is like going to a restaurant the attendant asks you "how hungry are Sir, I am going to charge you depending on your hunger" or driving to a gas station " How empty is your tank because we charge depending on how empty your tank is!"
I will nevee go there again and advice everyone to stay away from Casino car wash!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) First and last time you visited this place. Very BAD SERVICE, I do not recommend it. In my experience ,,,, when I arrived I asked for the 30.00 wash and the owner put a $ 20.99 wash on my car ticket which I realized later because as soon as it came out of washing and half drying and then they were telling me that it was already It was finished ... I complained to them and they gave him 2 more minutes of detail, according to complete the 30.00. HOW AWFUL!!! I found the car with fingerprints, the wheels super dirty and I vacum very badly .... I don't go back to this place. Not friendly the owner is ...... !!!!

Primera y última ves que visitó este lugar. Muy MAL SERVICIO, no lo recomiendo. En mi experiencia,,,, cuando llegue pedi el lavado de  30.00 y el dueño puso en el ticket de mi carro un lavado de $20.99 lo cual me di cuenta luego porque en cuanto salió de lavarse y media secada y luego me estaban avisando que ya estaba terminado... Les reclame y le dieron 2 minuros mas de detalle, segun para acompletar los 30.00. QUE HORROR!!! Encontre el carro con marcas de dedos, los rines super sucios y la vacum muy mal.... Ya no vuelvo a este lugar. Ni amable el dueño es......!!!!<//Text>

<text>This was so much fun to take the kids to! I had no idea the little details that went into these trains rides. It was like magic to see their faces and hear their laughter. Inexpensive, enjoyable and a lot to do at the park after the ride. Will definitely go back soon!< /text><Time>1620022825636< /Time>< Rating>

Public rides are available from 11am to 3pm (weather permitting) on the 1st weekend (Sat & Sun) of months March through Sept.  So much fun for everyone. HIGHLY recommend.</Text>< pics>

The trains are really cool. A great idea for outdoor activity for families. Currently adhering to covid protocols including separating riders. My kids love it!</text>

We loved it.  I took my 11, 12 & 21 year old daughter's.  My 4 month old great nephew, my 5 week old grandaughter.  Myself 64 and my niece 40. It was perfect weather and only $10 for all of us to ride the train.</review>

Cute trains are fun for kids, but we've been in line for an hour and a half and our 3 year old is all done and wants to go home.  ☹️</Review>

I called Diego and asked for a same day Appt and he got me in. His entire team was professional, knowable about the product and did great work!!!!
Another great impression for me, was I had all my windows done and I was only there for about an hour an 15 minutes!!! Thank you Diego !!!!
I would recommend you to anyone!!
Guys, girls if you are looking for quality ,great work fast and professionalism , go see Diego and Julian !<//Review>

<user>111246568376585015167<//user><text>I would’ve given a 2 but because they helped me on their first mistake with no hassles they get a 3. I came here not too long ago and had my windows done. Well I had to return because the front passenger tint had folded. So they fixed that and I went about my time. Well I finally got to get down on my car and wash it and all 4 windows have streaks from the spray they used to stick it on. They said it would go away and it apparently didn’t because they all have it and bad. From the inside they all look crystal clear but from the outside it looks like trash. And the warranty doesn’t cover that thing even though it’s their mistake. Now I have to either deal with it or pay full service again to have it fixed. I don’t really have 180 to throw at the windows again</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

<text>Left my car dirty and scratched my front windshield taking off the mirror. Also had 3 different prices for the work on the receipt. A little unorganized but great service. Saying the car is done but have my mirror not In place when I go to leave and when they put it on it rattled like crazy. Probably wouldn’t go here again even if it is lifetime warranty.<//text><gmapID>0x80c34b96e9059d79:0x42005469401dc543< /gmapID>< pictures>

<Review>Driving down the coast, starving and in need of walking around a bit, we completely randomly found Arcata - and then the Farmers Market.
It didn’t have a huge variety of take away food but good selection of produce.  It was a good Humboldt County vibe and hey, grilled oysters!</Review>< userid>

I love this farmer's market! I discovered mushrooms I never knew existed that are now my new favorites. I also love the fact that for us low income working poor people who get "food stamps", as they used to be known, that they will match you dollar for dollar up to $10 so you're $10 is now $20. I think that is awesome.  I love supporting the farmers market. You get good quality organic produce and help support the local small farms, you might pay a little bit more but it's better quality & like my brother says pay more now for better food or pay later at the doctor!< /Review>

Gotta check out earth n hands hot sauce as well as try some new mushrooms! Not to mention the amazing goat cheese in the purple booth! Good place to hacky sack with strangers or jam with some transients,
Check out the outskirts surrounding to support small craft artists and pick up some neat gem stones! Also you can get 10 dollars for free with food stamps from the main booth!!</Text>

<Review>It was really crowded and people don't social distance well. A few take down their masks to talk over them. Don't go if you are concerned about Covid safety. I am vaccinated and wore three masks, so I was unbothered.</Review>< Pics>

<text>The ladies greeted me as soon as I came in. The lady who helped me (I didn't get her name but she was pregnant) was super nice and made sure I was happy with the job she did.  She also helped me picked out a brow powder and the right color.<//text>< gmapID>

<Text>Recently moved to Temecula from another state and I’m super picky about my eyebrows, and who does them! I took a leap of faith trying this place and I’m actually glad I did. Mita is who I always wait for. She is very sweet and patient. As I explained to her how I usually got them done before, she listened to my input and I was happy with my results! Thanks Mita!</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1591840608980, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, So happy that you like the quality of our work, hope to see you soon.'}</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Last week, me and my brother drove to Magic Brow for the first time and were presently surprised by how friendly and welcoming the staff was to us first timers! I was so glad to have Saba take care of my eyebrows because I had been so nervous considering it was my first time but I can gladly say that I was under very good, well trained hands. I wouldn’t trust any other place with my eyebrows and would recommend Magic Brow to anyone!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Not good... I was checking the reviews for Magic Brows and saw one review that said she left cuts under her eyebrow. I thought “Oh it’s a one time thing we all make mistakes,” so I went there for the first time a couple days ago. When she finished there were four cuts under my left eyebrow and 2 small ones under my right; as well as some hairs that were still left untouched! I was shocked to say the least although I didn’t say anything. Now that a couple days have passed, the cuts appear to look more visible and deeper! It is not a pretty sight to the point where my own friends and family asked what happened to my eyebrows.

I usually don’t write reviews but this had to be said.< /text>

<text>I was very disappointed with my last session here. I went in to get my face threaded and when I was done, I tried to pay but their card reader was not working properly so I had to leave to go to my bank, take out money, and go back to the store to pay, which was quite the inconvenience as well as a waste of time. The cost was $38 plus a $10 tip. I should not have included a tip at all because when I got home, I used my mirror to inspect my face and noticed patches of hair all over my face. I even had patches under my eyebrow and mustache area that still had hair. I was angry because I paid $48 for an unfinished job. Sadly, I will never come back here again.</text>< pics>

This is a fantastic grocery store. They have pretty much all you're looking for. Friendly and attentive staff. They say hello when you walk-in. The meat section is fantastic as is the produce. They're not as expensive as I expected. The meats are a bit more spendy but worth it.<//Text>

Wow! I wanted to get some nice steak fillets for my family. I had never been to this butcher before this time. I was thrilled with the personal attention and later when we ate our steaks... they were probably the best steaks we had ever had.
OK seriously the best! My brother who likes his steak cooked a little more and then covers it in A-1 sauce ate this steak without any additional sauces AND he was the first one done. I thought that said a lot about the flavor!<//Review>

Got a 21 day dry aged bone in ribeye from them and it was awesome! They said to cook it no more than 5 minutes per side and they were spot on.

Food was outstanding as was the service.
We had B luncheon-$25 nigiri sushi lunch which included 3 pieces of California and a tad of grilled salmon. Amazing fish. And we ordered tempura on the side. Everything was excellent.< /Review>< pictures>

I came here with my girlfriend and couple of friends, and I must say the experience was good. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. You might have to wait a bit outside to get in, but it’s worth it in my opinion. Will come back soon.</Text>

<review>The sushi here is a great deal for the quality offered (compared to other sushi places in the south bay).

I had the 'extra special chirashi' and the fish was fresh and very tasty. Would definitely recommend trying this place out.< /review>< Pics>

The best value for extra fresh, high quality sushi in the South Bay! There are places with better sushi in SF but you’ll be paying a pretty penny for it. Don’t make your wallet suffer when that sushi craving hits you like a train—just order the extra special nigiri set (you can sub out some of the sushi pieces for something random if there’s one you don’t really like. They charge a dollar a piece for that I think). I usually sub out the clam< /text>

<text>Spectacular local spot. Really high quality sushi, great price. No frills, no gimmicks, just well made sushi with quality ingredients.

No more expensive than a chain sushi place in the area but worlds better. Friendly service. Always overjoyed with anything I get here, never had better. Impress dates, treat yourself.

COVID has slowed it down a bit, make sure you call in your order 20-40 mins ahead of time, and you'll be in and out as fast as the line can move.< /text>< Time>

<review>In my opinion, Tomi is the best sushi spot in the Bay Area.
When we moved from Mountain View to SF, we expected to find our sushi spot. Instead, we found that none of them have quite compared to Tomi. Either the sushi was fantastic but too expensive, or the prices were decent but the fish to rice ratio was terrible or the quality of the fish was lacking.
What really sets Tomi apart is their customer service. Personally, I love their first come, first serve approach. Though it can get quite busy during peak hours, it’s always worth the wait. Plus, the nicest people you’ll ever meet will greet and serve you. Each server at Tomi is kind, attentive, and ensures that you leave smiling. This is the type of spot that once you visit 3 times, they know who you are and begin to greet you by name.
During COVID, Tomi quickly adjusted to take out dining. When in person dining began again, they adjusted again to make you feel safe dining inside (seating very limited tables well apart, instituting contract tracing, ensuring patrons followed mask rules, etc.).
Overall, I cannot recommend this spot enough. It’s a gem! Special thank you to the Tomi team for always making us feel welcome. You guys are amazing and we love visiting you!< /review><Name>Barbara Bowden< /Name><rate>5</rate><GmapID>0x808fb73161d008c9:0xf1ccd9ca251ef04< /GmapID><Time>1605308287484<//Time></record></dataset><record>

The place's ambiance is pretty hipster. It's a good place for a date. They have good vegan options. I liked the quote that they had by Mother Theresa. One recommendation I would make, is that the restaurant needs to come up with a new to-go system. There was a line in the restaurant for to-go and it was annoying at times when the line would reach our table. We noticed that a lot of the tables were waiting a long time for their food. We think that the kitchen was focusing on the to-go customers more than the in-house costumers, which is why there was a delay. Overall, this place is a good place for some Thai food.  The manager should recognize Jay for all of his great customer service.< /text>

Good place for nigiri. A little annoying to order for pickup though - had a call a few times because it the phone was busy. One of the few restaurants that doesn't let you make an order through google maps.<//text>

Hands down best pure sushi in Mountain View. They get the rice right and the cuts are great. This is for sushi lovers, Not mass quantity roll lovers.<//Text>

Finally got to come here after wanting to for over a year. We ordered lunch take out. The maguro, sake, and hamachi sashimi that is listed on the dinner menu is available for lunch! We ordered that and their seasonal bluefin toro, kanpachi, and hirame nigiri. Fish is extremely fresh. Sashimi slices are also nice and thick! Not those flimsy small bites you get elsewhere. I'd definitely come here again in the near future. This meal was close to 100$ after tax and tip but it fed 3 people.

The ordering is restricted to take out right now. I highly recommend calling right when they open and then showing up 30ish after to pick up. There were people in line for pick up when I got there at 11:40am on a Tuesday. I placed my order at 11:25am and left the restaurant and 11:55am. There is just one lady running phones, shipping out orders, and taking in person orders so it's a bit slow but this can't be helped im the pandemic. If you're willing to wait a bit, or phone in early, it's worth it!<//Review>

<Review>There are a lot of sushi restaurants in Mountain View, but I think this is the best. I’ve been going here for a long time now, and everything is always tasty and fresh and quickly prepared. They have adapted well to the COVID restrictions and are still tasty and fresh and quick. They are also quite popular.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fb73161d008c9:0xf1ccd9ca251ef04<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Solid experience.

Beer (Sapporo) was well priced.

Rolls were a great proportion of filling to rice (although a little on the unwieldy size).

Service was courteous and friendly.

Nothing not to like.

Super busy.  Good sized crowd waiting outside for tables by the time we left.< /Text>

Highest quality authentic sushi in the South Bay area! The sushi sets are also very reasonably priced and include several premium pieces of sushi, which is an awesome option for those always holding back on ordering the expensive ~$10 individual pieces (cough fatty tuna and sea urchin cough) 😉🍣✨ Would return any day!< /review>

One of the best Japanese restaurants in Mountain View! Tonkatsu Don is a large serving, same with other combos. Dragon Roll is also very awesome.

We went at around 5:45 pm on Tuesday and was #2 on the waiting list. We wait for around 15 mins to get a seat.<//Text>

The food is always great at the place, but we had a bad experience when we called them to order the food. We had questions for the menu, but the people kept telling us to call back since people are waiting in the line. But I need to know if I can order the food due to the potential allergies of my family member. I couldn't find their daily special menu online. I wish they can find a better way to deal with the big amount of waiting line, but not reduce the service qualify.</Text>

Excellent sushi and reasonable price for the quality. The shop is super charming, although there's usually a 20-25 minute wait on weekdays and I assume longer on weekends.

They have big variety pack dinner sets you can choose from, or you can order a la carte with a paper slip. They also have udon and other typical Japanese dishes, although I came here for the sushi.<//Review>

South Bay has many sushi options when you’re feeling fun in Silly Valley. This small family owned joint offers a wide range of sushi, served up as fresh as you can get it. Good place for groups or dates. The cuts of fish are large and in charge. Bring your appetite or plan on taking it home. Orders can be placed with a menu card the table fills out for nigiri.<//text>

I only tried the omakase but it was disappointing.  The chef selected fish, while fresh, were tough and too chewy, and really lacked those natural salty/umami flavors. Rice was also too plain and the sour vinegar taste was absent.  Overall it felt like the fish were not aged and processed appropriately.<//text>

<text>Terrific sushi in the heart of Mountain View. The fish was very fresh, and I appreciated the waiter's suggestions on rolls. Wait time was slightly long, but this place only has a few tables for groups larger than 4. It's a lively atmosphere, and I appreciate the din and feeling of a neighborhood sushi bar!<//text>< Pics>

<Response>None<//Response><Rate>5< /Rate><text>There is a line at lunch hour and I can see why. Lunch box is good deal especially for downtown mountain view. Sashimi is fresh and thick cut. Sushi combo has a piece of uni (sea urchin) sushi which is not common, as sea urchin is expensive ingredient and rarely included in combos.
Food itself is standard reliable quality. I wouldn't say anything stands out in particular. It's a win more for the value, than fanciness or creativity.< /text>< GmapID>

The only downside: they served soup after salad and main dish.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUfNF00S3mkkpCuYXQukuRNJB2jLFyJNP7Zlov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Quaint little sushi place with excellent sushi! All the fish tasted fresh, sushi pieces were generously sized and the wait staff was friendly.

The restaurant is a common after dinner spot for the tech crowd and always has a wait list unless you arrive right when it opens.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><gmapID>0x808fb73161d008c9:0xf1ccd9ca251ef04< /gmapID><Text>This sushi restaurant is excellent and it’s the most popular in Mountain View for a reason! It’s a little out of the way looking - definitely not what I expected at first brush, but the food is incredible and they give you great portion sizes.
I would say the one downside is that because it has such a popular reputation there’s a line out of the door pretty much any day of the week. The line is first-come first-serve, so for example I went at 7 pm on a Tuesday and still had to wait 40 minutes to seat a party of two.
That aside, the price is reasonable, the wait staff is (very) attentive (since they’re trying to seat so many people they prefer you order quickly), and it’s worth the wait; definitely a must try in Mountain View.</Text><date>1567209321526<//date></record>

Great sushi. You can tell it's really popular as there is always a wait outside. It's a small place but they churn out the food relatively fast and the quality of the fish is superb.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I'm not a great fan of sushi (or any raw food items) but I try sushi once in a while..!
This restaurant is located slightly away from the castro street.
But noticed that it always has huge line of people waiting outside. I have  waited for almost 30 min to get seated.
It was difficult for me to order, because every item has some japanese name that I could not figure out whether it was raw or cooked. I looked at the table next to me and noticed this beautiful looking sushi and decided to try it.
I ordered that dish (spicy bomb -- Sushi fried and  served with spicy sauce) and loved it..!
Attached the photo.
Green Tea ice cream was also good.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPylhUjW1OoDEw84LjtUJfn2AwMhD4NGLx9ynlV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZvailaDOOKpxM9GX3v8fgg_WyYBSqs-LeONhH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

This place really converted me to enjoy nigiri that is usually avoid: sea urchin, eel and oyster! They are so fresh and tasty, you knew it was made from the best ingredients and it definitely did not disappoint. Friendly service and so cool to watch your sashimi, sushi and nigiri get prepared right in the heart of the restaurant</text>

It is crowded, even it is not weekend. Waiting time is around 30 mins. The sashimi is so good, it is very fresh and high quality. Saba shioyaki, beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki are really full enough for 1.5 people. The dinner/luchn special comes with salad and miso soup. Overall, Sushi Tomi is definitely great  Japenese restaurant.</Text>

What a delicious and great variety of sushi we had in our first but certainly not last visit to Sushi Tomi! It was a great experience. The plates were quite abundant too! There is always a line to get in but it is totally justified. I am looking forward to get back to Mountain View to visit again. Salmon roe, Eel and Sea Urchid were my favourite ones but  all others were awesome too!</text>

<Review>The wait was long, but worth it, Considering there is not many sushi ya in the town. The fish was so fresh just collapsing on my tongue, sliding down!!! It seems to me that all raw fishes are aged sushi, i am not sure anyway, one of the must-go place in palo alto/mtv. I think one of the specialty here is salmon!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<username>Elizabeth Force<//username><Text>There is a reason that Sushi Tomi has a line of 20+ people waiting outside for dinner on any given night, despite a plethora of sushi places with opening in downtown Mountain View. This place is down right delicious, and I’ve never enjoyed sushi more. No frills, no reservations, just good sushi. So if craving sushi but scared of the line, put your name on the list, the wait is never very long, and it’s well worth it. My favorite is the sushi tomi roll with sake (salmon).< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

This sushi is pretty good and is consistent for each visit. This place is extremely popular for dinner and has limited space, so expect to have a wait. They do not accept any reservations, but the wait is generally worth it.

Additionally, their miso soup is fantastic and that's important at a Japanese restaurant.< /Text>

Great sushi, rolls and sashimi. The dishes are always fresh. The Hamachi Kama (grill hamachi gill) and Sushi Deluxe are my favorite. Considering the quality, I think the menu is reasonably priced. It's busy all the time but we always come here before 6pm to beat the crowd.</Text>

Had a selection of nigiri sushi here. The fish was fresh and well prepped. However, the temperature of the rice was too cold and inconsistent between the pieces. Good sushi is as much about the rice as the fish.<//review>

We were visiting some friends in the Bay area and asked them to take us to their favorite restaurant, without hesitation, they said Sushi Tomi.  This place was one of my favorite sushi places I have ever been, and I am ridiculously picky.  Everything was really fresh and tasted amazing.  I'm so sad that it's so far away from me so I can't go all the time!  The staff was really friendly, the service was quick, and the atmosphere was just lively enough to feel like you could have fun conversation without disrupting others.  Highly recommend!< /text>

Very good quality sushi. Come if you like high quality fish with little thrills. More authentic than your average sushi joint. Don't come if you are expecting fancy rolls.</Review>

<text>This place is AMAZING. I highly recommend the sashimi. The fish was so fresh and melts right in your mouth. The nigiri is also very food but spicy because of the wasabi. The service is so fast even though there is always a line during rush hour. This place is super authentic and a must try.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXiLAhCpN9vMs-reU-7esr5pcXM9bxLDFlENch=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808fb73161d008c9:0xf1ccd9ca251ef04<//GmapID></record>

<text>Such amazing Japanese food, my favorite in the Bay! Very authentic and fresh fish for some amazing sushi and sashimi as well as donburi bowls. You cannot go wrong here, everything is well done, just make sure to not go at rush hour because you will waste the whole lunch waiting!</text>< pictures>

After my friends recommended the place, I tried to come twice but didn’t manage to get a table as the queue was so long! Finally I went early arriving at 6pm and order the omakase set (45USD) and oysters. Food is delicious and service is great. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because sushi over at Asia is still slightly better, but all in all highly recommend !<//text>

At the first moment  you arrive in this restaurant  the waiters give you a great feeling. Very congenial team, it is a nice restaurant to hang out with friends and colleagues or with your date. Excellent  meals, skillful  chief cook and stuff, decent  cost and generous  service. Highly recommended.</review>

<review>This is an authentic Japanese sushi place.   Fresh fish, tasty appetizers and large crowds on Friday when I visited.   Advised to be there early,  a short line formed in front of the restaurant at 5PM,  opening time was 530 PM.  The $50, 10 piece sushi omakase was a great deal.  Add $30 and you get three more appetizers to make sure anyone is full afterward.  Great value plus efficient service.   Definitely worth a visit.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Love Sushi Tomi! One of my favourite places in the MTV/SV Area. Definitely a little pricier than Niji down the street but worth it for quality sushi.

There’s typically a wait (around 15-30 mins for 2) no matter the evening... but it goes by fast. They don’t take reservations so this is really the only option.

They do take out as well. Lots of people ordered take out as we were waiting for our table.

Aside from food we also tried a beer and sake and they were delicious too!< /review>< pics>

A lot of other restaurants often give a good variety of fish types in a set like this, but usually none of the pricier items. To my surprise, my plate featured a piece of chutoro (medium fatty tuna) and uni (sea urchin) nigiri, and a negitoro (fatty tuna and green onion) maki roll, which coincidentally are a few of my absolute favourites, especially when it comes to judging the quality of a new sushi joint.

<review>Great sushi and priced accordingly. Really good sushi for humans as well as dogs. One of the older, well known sushi restaurants in Mountain View. The only drawback is the wait. Can be up to an hour in some cases, and they are generally packed every night due to their popularity. One trick to avoid the wait js to call in and pick up. Then eat at home and share with your pup!<//review>< Pictures>

Went there 5 min late (they close briefly in the afternoon before re-opening during dinner time). The owner was kind enough to let me in. Their chirashi don is good - not to the level that can be called impressive but still good value for the price.</Text>

Probably the best sake (salmon) nigiri I’ve had in the Bay Area for quite some time, from a place that’s not needlessly expensive or fancy.

That buttery, melt in your mouth taste reminded me how many other sushi places mask the flavor behind a vast array of highly-decorated rolls (name your aioli flavor...). This understated place does it right!</Review>

Sushi is excellent! I always get the sushi omakase here. Other dishes were not so great though. Miso soup was quite salty and broiled squid was flavorless.< /Review>

I ordered the extra special Chirashi bowl and it did not disappoint! The quality of the fish was amazing and there was a lot of variety. The service was excellent. The lady kept apologizing for our food being late but it was a weekday lunch service. It wasn’t late by any standards and we could tell they were busy. She really didn’t have to do that but it was appreciated. :)</Text>

<Text>Delicious! Finally tried this place and waited 30 mins for a table for two. Usually there is a line out the door which discouraged us from trying but it was pretty worth it. The sushi was delicious and fresh, my favourite was the Tomi sushi roll with hamachi. The sake and beer selections are rather simple but still delicious and well priced as well!
The bar seating was also more quickly available if you're looking for a quick bite and don't mind.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-xvHDEJO0PrRyRSZMGFyi_oBoMZ0f41PZ5ked=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Great Sushi and sashimi but if you don't arrive early (before 6) expect to sign in and wait around an hour. Generally worth it.<//review>

Have never liked sushi until I tried this place.  I refused to eat it.  Came here and tried a little bit of their tuna and fell in love.  It was an amazing experience with real crab and great bbq eel.  I now have a golden standard when trying sushi, and it is worth whatever wait in line there is.  Highly recommend this place just off the main road in downtown mountain view.<//Text>

This place has some of the best quality sushi in the bay and it shows by the incredibly long wait line from the moment they open till close. You won't have a bad meal here but I will say that I could eat only their California rolls for the rest of my life and be perfectly satisfied. The creamy (real) crab mix is just the best I've ever had (and I normally never order the California roll).<//text>

Rivals the only other amazing sushi I've had in the Bay Area (Fuji Sukiyaki). Expensive, limited seating, seems par for the course! Three people each ordering the $80 Chef's Choice, and the whole thing was wonderful. Come hungry, bring your wallet, and get there no later than 5:40pm.</Review>

The food was good (not amazing but, good). However, my water had, what looked like, food particles in it before I had even touched it and our waiter spilt a full plate of food onto the table. Granted the food was fried and easy to place back onto the plate but, they didn't even bring a replacement nor ask if we wanted a replacement. It seemed they were uninterested in remaking the dish so, they removed the order from the bill which I guess was a nice gesture. But, if you ordered something to eat, it's because you want to eat it...<//review>

It's the best sushi spot that I've found so far in the lower peninsula.  It's our go to place down here.   They often have a line unless you come early.   If you don't come early, do takeout.   The sushi is always fresh.   They have a good variety.   Their Tomi special roll is very good - seared salmon and scallops on top of your choice of hamachi, salmon or spicy tuna filling.   The have all of the standard popular rolls and they're all pretty good.   The super bomb roll, fried spicy tuna roll, can be a bit dry.  Their omakase is reasonably priced.  They have Japanese beers on tap as well as a couple of other Japanese beers that are more uncommon.< /review>

That was terrible. The octopus was like chewing rubber with no flavor, and the sushi had big pieces of carrots. It was tough and unsavory.<//Text>

I ordered the extra special Chirashi bowl and it did not disappoint! The quality of the fish was amazing and there was a lot of variety. The service was excellent. The lady kept apologizing for our food being late but it was a weekday lunch service. It wasn’t late by any standards and we could tell they were busy. She really didn’t have to do that but it was appreciated. :)</text>

<Text>Extremely fresh and delicious sushi. Reasonable priced for the quality. Wasabi had a light body and very good texture, which indicated freshness and quality ingredients. Place is usually packed. Expect 15-20 minutes average wait.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiKb-WwT3DjxG-mNtbS4Xv_hcPIuOFO0XGJ_73=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

IMO, best sushi place in South Bay. Atmosphere is traditional Japanese, heavy on bamboo and light wood tones. Staff is not overly friendly, but this results in a focus on great food and quick service. Quality of fish is fantastic, even on a Sunday. Highly recommend coming here, but be sure to arrive close to opening dinner time as lines get long fast.< /Text>

I've been here several times now and have never been disappointed. The restaurant itself isn't super big and they have yet to integrate with Yelp waitlist, so you certainly should expect a bit of a wait.

Maybe that one punctual friend in your party can put his/her name down first while everyone else shows up 15-20 minutes late. That happened to me a few times, and while I didn't LOVE waiting by myself, at least nobody else had to wait -_-...

I am usually a man of habit, so most of the time I just order their sushi rolls. But last time I came, a friend ordered the hamachi kama and it was amazing. Ambrosian even. It was so fatty and so juicy, almost like butter melting in your mouth. I'd definitely recommend you to try that!<//review>

Used to be great but now 'only' one of the best sushi place in the hood. (Fish quality still good but sometimes the chef is not slicing quite right the less common varieties of sushi; wait staff seems a little less friendly/attentive as they were a decade ago....)

Sushi Tomi is still the place to check out first when we feel like sushi in Mountain View, though now we often will go somewhere else if the line is long, rather than wait half an hour or more.<//review>

Don't think, just order the sushi dinner. Simple sushi executed really well. If you're really hungry order some rolls on the side.</Text>

<Text>Sushi is excellent, good quality and freshness, some out of the ordinary varieties of fish. Kitchen items are not as good as the sushi but are okay. Service is friendly and attentive. Always a line at the door but worth the wait if you want good sushi.< /Text>< rate>

This place was awesome. We were visiting some friends in the Bay area and asked them to take us to their favorite restaurant, without hesitation, they said Sushi Tomi.  This place was one of my favorite sushi places I have ever been, and I am ridiculously picky.<//Review>

There's always a wait and they don't take reservations, so if you want to guarantee a table, you need to show up 15 min before opening. Otherwise you can wait from 30-45min for a table for 4.

Fish so fresh and tasty you want to slap yo mama. Non-sushi products just ok and seem to be there to please people who don't want raw fish. Takoyaki on point though.<//Review>

Top notch quality sake, futomaki, unagi don, and vegetable tempura. Everything tasted so, so, so fresh and delicious. Generous portions at reasonable prices. This sushi restaurant is about half an hour away from where we live, but it will definitely be our new go-to sushi restaurant from now on.<//Text>

I ordered the Chirashi, Special. Great variety of fesh and big slices of fishes. If I recalled correctly they are tuna, salmon, yellowtail, eel, surf clam, sweet egg omelet, salmon roe, shrimp, and flounder and they are served over sushi seasoned rice, which many fake Japanese restaurants would just served plain unseasoned sushi rice. Yes it does make a difference. Since I was only able to tribe item, can't put love it yet, will try a few more menu items then update.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Walk inside and put your name and how many in you party on their list. Choose if you want a table, the Sushi bar or either, and then head back outside and wait to be called.

Don't let the line fool you- it moves a lot quicker than you expect.

And once you get inside, you will find it was worth the wait, long or short. This place is buzzing! I was given a seat at the bar (my first choice) and was promptly asked for my drink order as I was seated- excellent! I was given a dinner menu and a paper Sushi menu with a pencil, alternatively I could order straight from the Sushi chefs; and a small bowl of Edamame. I ordered a draft beer and a large Saké.

For dinner, I ordered several pieces of Nigiri Sushi, as well as 3 rolls. about 15 minutes later I was served a beautifully displayed plate of fresh and tasty Sushi, and enjoyed it immensely.

I love sitting at the Sushi bar and watching the chefs do their amazing food-art, but it is also great seeing all the people come and go, and watching the servers organize a veritable symphony of getting people seated in a quick, but orderly fashion.

This place is loud and fun, food is excellent, and do NOT be put off by the amount of people outside- it's quicker than you think and worth the wait!</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

This is an excellent and well established restaurant.  Great sushi with very fast and friendly service.  I have been here several times, and always leave happy.  It is a rather small dining area and popular, so expect a wait, but always worth it.  Straightforward and traditional in style and presentation.< /review>

Consistently good sushi. We have been coming here for years and the quality is consistently good, the fish fresh and the place packed. If the staff would make a little more effort to clear and clean the tables quickly and be a little more responsive I might consider another star.</Text>

This has to be the best Sushi and Sashimi I had in the Bay so far.
It's on the pricey side but you get what you paid for. They are serving high quality fish and the cuts are thick and well balanced with the rice.
They also offer a very large choice of fish.
Really good restaurant overall but heavy eater be warned, you'll likely have to pay extra for sides as the entrées feel kind of small.
On a side note, the Bento and Lunch menus, while good, don't deserve the premium price of the place in my opinion. I'd rather go to a more casual Japanese place for these.</Review>

It was really good food and the wait was well worth it. The sushi was delicious and tasty. The yellow tail was particularly good. Also tried sea urchin here and it was delicious. I believe I had some sort of platter where it was a bunch of nigiri. Would highly recommend for groups between 2-6 people any more and it may not work.<//review>

Extremely fresh and delicious sushi. Reasonable priced for the quality. Wasabi had a light body and very good texture, which indicated freshness and quality ingredients. Place is usually packed. Expect 15-20 minutes average wait.<//Text>

We went there on a Monday night, and had to wait outside in the cold for about 20 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. Really good sushi.</review>

Went to Sushi Tomi with friends on a weekend night. The line was long, but definitely worth it. We ordered Chirashi sushi bowl, the fish was fresh rice was tasty, great service and food. It is lucky to have Tomi Sushi in Mountain View.<//Text>

Home style cooking; reliably good. Sushi Tomi has a line most days and for good reason-- the food is good and the prices are reasonable too (for Japanese food in the Bay Area). If you get the lunch special you don't need to order extra food; the portion sizes are quite generous.</Review>

Best sushi I have had in the bay area outside of SF, Sushi Tomi does a great job at giving the look, feel, and taste of a sushi bar in Japan. The genmai cha was also great, in a cute clay mug at that! There really is no better feeling than a hot cup of perfectly brewed genmai cha with freshly prepared sushi. シェフの皆ありがとうございます!<//Review>

Bit if a wait on Friday night, but that is to be expected for a place this popular.  The fish was so very fresh.

We tried the Tomi roll land weren't very in love with the flame roasted sushi flavor on top of the roll. I guess we just prefer the raw fish, go figure.  It too was very fresh, do it wasn't the fault of the fish or prep.

I got the real wasabi that you order off the sushi a la carte menu and it was VERY good.  It's actual "horse radish" and not reconstituted paste.< /Text>

This is the best authentic Japanese restaurant we know of in downtown Mountain View. They aren't terribly innovative or creative, just good traditional food. They have been there for a long time.

They are quite popular so a reservation or early arrival is advised. Also, don't do what I did and call the similarly named Tomi Sushi which is not the same restaurant.

There is a free public parking lot across the street. If that fills up, which it often does, you can generally find street parking in the neighborhood.</Review>

<review>Outstanding.

One of the best Japanese, if not, the best Japanese I've ever had. They take their craft seriously.

I have been five times since working in the area. Every time is amazing.

I have had the Special Chirashi on most occasions.  The chefs put together a nice spread. They really try to complement all the different textures and flavours.

As an interesting point, I normally do not like the pickled ginger in Japanese cuisine, but I realized it's because I've never had it as fresh and tasty as Tomi makes it. Their wasabi is also very fresh.

There is almost always a long line/wait to get in. They don't take reservations, but the wait is well worth it. You will NOT be disappointed.

Good, fast service in an authentic setting. It's on the cheaper end but always busy. The sushi is not made as well as some of the other places but it does the job. Service is friendly and fast. Prepare to stand at least 20 minutes in a queue outside and make sure to put your name down when you get there.< /text>

Great sushi options for combos and individual pieces. The chefs choice is varied each time I've gone compared to other places where it seems to be a set option.  They also have good teriyaki options. The drink menu is limited but they have Sapporo on draft. The atmosphere is cozy and good for a date or small groups. It is a popular place and there is usually a wait for seating.< /text>

<text>Went here for dinner on a Friday night. We got there early so no wait for parking or seating. The food was well prepared and large portions. When we left there was a line out front. Small but nice atmosphere. My advice is to go early or be prepared to wait.</text>< pics>

Great sushi and came out very quick. We had a group of 7 and expected to wait for a table since the place was pretty full. However, they were able to find space for us fairly quickly, which we appreciated. I'd gladly come back again.</review>

Best sushi I have had in the bay area outside of SF, Sushi Tomi does a great job at giving the look, feel, and taste of a sushi bar in Japan. The genmai cha was also great, in a cute clay mug at that! There really is no better feeling than a hot cup of perfectly brewed genmai cha with freshly prepared sushi. シェフの皆ありがとうございます!< /text>

Outstanding.

One of the best Japanese, if not, the best Japanese I've ever had. They take their craft seriously.

I have been five times since working in the area. Every time is amazing.

I have had the Special Chirashi on most occasions.  The chefs put together a nice spread. They really try to complement all the different textures and flavours.

As an interesting point, I normally do not like the pickled ginger in Japanese cuisine, but I realized it's because I've never had it as fresh and tasty as Tomi makes it. Their wasabi is also very fresh.

There is almost always a long line/wait to get in. They don't take reservations, but the wait is well worth it. You will NOT be disappointed.

Keep up the great work here.< /review>

I had been reluctant to try Sushi Tomi since everyone had told me it is the BEST sushi in the bay so I had some seriously high expectations coming here.  I was in the area after the Mountain View Farmer's Market and decided it would be fun to grab a quick sushi snack here and try their sushi pieces.  I ordered salmon and red snapper, which I had never tried before.

The red snapper was incredibly unique - but in a delicious way, not in a euphemism for gross way.  The sushi chef suggested that I don't dip this in soy sauce to appreciate the flavors, and he definitely was right.  It was light and refreshing.  The

The salmon was out of this world, mouth-gasm inducing delicious.  It encompassed everything I had ever wanted from salmon, and I loved it so much that I had to order another.

Sushi Tomi hands down has the best fish in the bay.  I don't know if they would be a good fit if you are looking for fusion rolls since they have a more straight up, traditional sushi vibe, but if you just appreciate delicious sushi, you will love it here.</Text>

<text>Very good sushi and great atmosphere. I tried a few rolls and my wife had chicken teriyaki with gyoza along with a large, warm sake. Sake was awesome and food was some of the best we've had. Only downside is it's a little pricey and can be very crowded during peak hours, but definitely worth the wait.</text><Date>1549949187732</Date>< user>

One of the best sushi spots in Mountain View, there is constantly a line here, and for the right reasons!

I would definitely recommend the Tomi Sushi Special Roll, it is really really good!

Service is quick and the green tea is included. Large groups are had to accomodate, but doable. Groups of 1-4 people are easy to get in.<//text>

< review>
I had been reluctant to try Sushi Tomi since everyone had told me it is the BEST sushi in the bay so I had some seriously high expectations coming here.  I was in the area after the Mountain View Farmer's Market and decided it would be fun to grab a quick sushi snack here and try their sushi pieces.  I ordered salmon and red snapper, which I had never tried before.

The red snapper was incredibly unique - but in a delicious way, not in a euphemism for gross way.  The sushi chef suggested that I don't dip this in soy sauce to appreciate the flavors, and he definitely was right.  It was light and refreshing.  The

The salmon was out of this world, mouth-gasm inducing delicious.  It encompassed everything I had ever wanted from salmon, and I loved it so much that I had to order another.

Sushi Tomi hands down has the best fish in the bay.  I don't know if they would be a good fit if you are looking for fusion rolls since they have a more straight up, traditional sushi vibe, but if you just appreciate delicious sushi, you will love it here.<//review>

After trying quite a few of the sushi spots in the bay area... Sushi Tomi is the best by far. This is the place we take friends when they visit. There's usually a wait but service is quick and friendly so you won't be waiting too long.< /review>

<text>The waiter brought me the wrong dish and instead of offering me the correct dish or an apology he got defensive an blamed me for his mistake.   I have been here a few times and the service is usually poor.  Food is average and they are in a rush to get you out of there by clearing the plates before you are done eating.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Not good at all compared to the sister restaurant in Saratoga. Not sure if off day, but came for dinner on a Sunday, got omakase nigiri and dinner combo. The omakase pieces were bad, usually there are at least 3-4 exceptional pieces. Also, the omakase at the Saratoga site also includes a fish miso soup and fried shrimp head, not included here. The nigiri here was bad bad that night<//text>

This place is very unassuming from the street, and the inside decor is somewhat dated. Don't let that stop you from coming in! We started with the vegetable tempura which was very good and with a variety of vegetables. Lunch for most of our party included miso soup and salad. We had a few vegetarians who had vegetarian rolls, and one of us (me) had salmon teriyaki, but the rest of course had sushi and sashimi. The variety was great and the food was fresh. Portions were not skimpy, either. Oh, and the iced green tea tasted so different than what I expected - so much fresher and not burnt!< /Review>

<text>My meal started out with a scrap soup full of bones to the point of being inedible. I was then served the daily special which was mini Chirashi. What that actually meant was rice with scrap pieces of poorly cut fish and a cold piece of a deep fried roll.

To their credit, the waitress did take the meal back and let me order a standard sushi lunch, but by then my partner has finished his meal and my appetite was partially ruined.

Definitely would not go out of my way to return.< /text><resp>None</resp><Rating>2<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

Great little sushi spot in downtown mountain view. High quality fish, not the best around but very good. Large selection of fish, nice staff. Would certainly come again. Also they have real wasabi, although it's still the powdered kind.< /Text>

I eat here about six times a year.  Wait time for lunch isn't bad, usually less than ten minutes.  Food is always delicious and high quality.  My lunch bill is usually $30/person, plus tip, which gets me miso, salad (weakest part of their offering), sashimi lunch, half a beer, half a roll, and half a tempura veggie platter.  I'm a big guy and that's a big lunch for me.  It's the basic sushi fare, I haven't seen much inventiveness or even change on the menu.

I keep coming back because I'm always happy when I leave.< /Text>

I've been to Sushi Tomi a couple of times.  The quality of the sushi here is FANTASTIC.  This is probably the freshest sushi I've had in the south bay.  The atmosphere is quite loud because of how popular this restaurant is.  The food is so good though, I still give it 5 stars.</review>

<review>Quality of food is great. Although the decor is stuck in the 80s.

This place is usually pack though so expect a line unless you go during off hours. I enjoy their sushi and rows as much as their other Japanese dish. Highly recommended if you're looking for good food and doesn't care about ambiance.< /review>< pictures>

The salmon nigiri was amazing. I also got the red snapper which was very good, but I think I will always prefer the salmon. My wife and I sat at the bar and got a chance to talk to the chef. He was very helpful and friendly. While this isn't the cheapest sushi in the south bay it is the best in terms of quality. As long as you have a large wallet or are in the mood to splurge, Sushitomi is the best.</review>

After a while - they stopped bringing water

The food here is average and the service is poor. I have no idea why this restaurant is so popular. To be clear, the food is not bad, but it's not creative at all. You can get tuna and salmon anywhere. All the specials were sold out and there was nothing to replace them. Not worth the wait.<//Text>

<Text>Just got back to this place after a year, couldn't believe the service.  It's Sucks. Server slaps the foods on the table without care and walked away. While my wife is eating, they just reach over her face forcing her to stop eating to get to the soy sauce. Man, I think this will be the last time.< /Text>< pics>

Great sushi place. Get there early or expect a long wait. They won't give you a table until your entire party is present.

Make sure you order special Tomi roll and the salmon Toro sushi.</text>

Tomi lived up to the hype.
It's a no frills sushi bar with friendly service and delicious sushi. The quality of produce really shines, I had the omakase menu and the hibachi, uni and yellowfin tuna were fantastic.<//Text>

Sushi Tomi was a good spot to grab some sushi in Mountain View. The decor is what you would expect and they have a decent amount of table's so we didn't have a wait. The service was prompt and professional. We all enjoyed our various meals and the quality of the fish was fresh.<//text>

<Review>I love love love this place. The food is amazing (the fish is very fresh) and worth the wait every time. They are very nice and generous when pouring the tea! The place is very traditional, with the wasabi included in the nigiri already (as it should be!). My boyfriend and I always want to try new places, but end up coming back here because of the quality!</Review>< Pictures>

Great deal for this quality of Sushi. Even in Tokyo, I think it's hard to find a similar quality - price Sushi restaurant. Also the service was great as the service person came to our table at the right time.< /Review>

For some reason, they decided to re-fry the tampula shrimp, but not doing the same thing on the veggies tampula.  Normally, this wouldn't happen in sushi tomi.< /text>

The rolls were fantastic.  Each one was perfect.

But more importantly, the sashimi was fresh, yummy, and generous portions.

This is not cheap sushi.  But it is one of the best around.

There is usually a wait outside, particularly on a Friday or Saturday night.  But folks, its worth it!< /Text>

The premier sushi restaurant in downtown Mountain View. Expect to wait for a table or sushi bar stool at popular times (and write down your name on the host's list), but the quality of the fish and food is extremely good. Well worth the wait and the price, and very authentically Japanese.< /review>

I was quite loyal to Sushi Tomi, but honestly my last experiences were quite bad. I think when the restaurant becomes very successful, they don't care so much anymore about service and quality. If I describe it in very general words - the service, how they treat customers became awful, and the food, they don't care anymore about good quality. Very disappointing.< /Text>

<text>You can get fancy and pay $33 for a dozen of sashimi with no rice, but I have to admit they're awesome. Really.
I took the sake sample on top of that and the owner (I think) noticed an amateur of good things and offered me a glass of a new "fruitier" sake they had just received. Really good :-).
Only four star, not because of quality but because it's slightly expensive. It's arguably worth five.< /text>< Name>

This was ok for the price, but I was a little disappointed given the really good reviews. Maybe we caught them on a bad night.

Got the Extra Special Nigiri. The tuna rolls were really good, but some of the other pieces were a little tough. The uni was really bad -- bitter and fishy. To make up for it, they gave us some ice cream on the house.

The place was packed even on a Tuesday, and other reviews are really good, so hopefully we just caught them on a bad night. I can't give more than a 3 for our visit, though.<//review>

<Text>I come again and order same chefs shusi. This time, Nigiri I have are great. (Different Chef!?)
I re-rate with 4 stars instead of 5. (No uni is a little bit disappointing)

--- 10 months ago ---
My friends and I waited more than 30 minutes to order chefs Shusi. The sushi was really horrible. Rice and fish was way too sour and soy sauce was way too salty. It's really imbalanced and disappointing. We can't even finish it though it cost us $45.<//Text><rate>4</rate>< Response>

Higher tier sushi place, but still affordable. Their fish is super fresh and super tasty. I had the sashimi plate and the shirashi several times and it was georgious, and generous! They can't take reservations and there is a line. Make sure to take your patience with you, it is worth it!< /text>

Lovely sushi, delicate, well-prepared and even better-plated. Note: They do serve their sushi with a slight bit of wasabi. You may want to ask them not to do that.</Text>

The food is super. The fish is fresh, the tea smelled and tasted nice. What I appreciated most is their outstanding service. I ordered an appetizer "Shiokara" (salted squid), assuming it was grilled squid. When the chef passed me a small plate of raw squid, I chickened out. I explained to the chef that I expected this to be grilled, and they simply said it's okay, they would take it back if I didn't want it any more. At that moment I know that I'll come back to this small sushi place again and again.<//text>

<Text>Fairly generic atmosphere, but great sushi and rolls at reasonable prices. The Tomi special roll is highly recommended. Long lines are common, but it could be worth it if you want to stick to the Mountain View area.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The waiter is rude. We come first, but she gave us the bar seats.  However, she gave other consumer table seats.   They are more polite to white American, sort of racist.  It is kind of sad, they got so many reviews just because they are old restaurant.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Sushi at the bar was too warm for my taste. They also heavily apply wasabi to the under side of the fish. Sometimes this is used to mask a bad flavor.</Text>

Prepare for a long wait (and forgot about making a reservation- they won't let you). Fish is fresh and they offer some unique rolls to try. They have Sapporo on tap :-)< /Review>

Place is always packed.  Sushi was okay, but it isn't very tightly rolled.  The pieces fall apart as you pick them up.  If they just took a little more time, the experience would be better.  Also it smells like old fish.  I know it is a sushi restaurant, but others that I go to don't stink like that.< /review>

Always fresh sushi here, making it worth the wait most evenings. Try lunch on the weekend to avoid the half hour wait. My wife loves the hamachi and I enjoy the chirashi special. Son swears by the rolls with a tempura appetizer.<//Text>

This place is fantastic. The pricing is what you'd expect from a mid-to-higher end sushi restaurant. Be sure to plan ahead and get there early as there's almost always a line and a wait to eat.</text>

Love this place! They have one of the freshest ingredients for food. The only thing is that you would have to deal with the long wait, which by the way o's worth it. Love the service too and if you are in mountain view, this will easily become your new sushi favorite.< /text>

It was very strong but definitely an experience after eating at countless Japanese restaurants with green horseradish. The chirashi I ordered was very good, quality fish that could be found throughout their nigiri as well. A smaller place with a 10-15 minute wait but with an amazing "sushi shop" vibe.< /review>< pics>

The restaurant has so many options for different Japanese food from popular sushi, sashimi, bento to bbq, noodles curry. I love the cold soba for summer time.

The restaurant is a bit crowded, there is about 30min-1hr waiting time, the wait is much longer at evenings and weekends.< /text>

Lunchbox is great especially chicken teriyaki. But arrive before 11:45am or after 12:30pm to avoid waiting. Do street parking.< /Text>

A really amazing sushi place, with lots of variety. The food and drink will not disappoint and this is probably the best sushi out of the many places in Mountain View and beyond. Taking a star off since getting a table here is always a hassle - they always have a line, usually before the place opens, and aren't on the usual reservation sites< /review>

Sushi here is so good! Highly recommend it. However, the wait to get in when I was there was 45 min. So plan accordingly.< /review>

Love 🍣 Tomi. It's a small space and wait is going to be long at peak hours 😟. Sushi is delicious and they have a good selection of sake.</Review>

Best sushi in downtown Mt. View. Good selection of other items too.  Always a line in the evening, but they're efficient and usually the wait isn't too long.<//review>

Charming authentic Japanese neighborhood restaurant with a super friendly atmosphere. The food is as good as a $$$$ experience, but affordable and with no pretension and stress. Try to sneak in earlier or later to beat the lines! This place is popular for very good reasons.< /text>

<Text>I simply loved it. Affordable price and wide variety of sushi. The bento set allows u to mix-and-match and is only for the price of 10.99 in the weekend. Parking? It is just opposite of a parking area.<//Text><rate>5< /rate><UserId.>108278549072427430837< /UserId.>< user_name>

<text>The food is not bad and I have been a usual. But recently, the place is very disorganized. (1) First, the new waitress put an extra chair next to our corner table, so there is no way for me to get out at all without disturbing the other table’s lunch. (2) Second, when I daughter had to use the bathroom, I decided to pack my half finished lunch so that I do not have to bother the other table from going in and out. I confirmed with the front desk girl that it’s ok for me to put the left over box on the front desk. But when we finished using the bathroom, the box is gone. And no one knows anything, the waitress just said she saw it earlier but she doesnt know where it went. I am annoyed that I lost my half way done lunch, but I am more concerned that they might put the box in someone else’s Togo because that’s what she was doing right there. My box is packed as if it’s a new order of katsu don, it’s not, it’s my half finished lunch.....<//text>< pics>

Very busy sushi restaurant, but the wait staff remains friendly (if hurried). The BBQ Eel roll was one of the best I've ever had, while the Spicy Tuna was solidly in the good category. It's a little pricey compared to local competitors.<//Text>

Perhaps I didn't know what to order, but whatever I had was not anything spectacular and certainly not as good as what I expected from the amount of review it had. In my personal opinion, Amami is much better.</review>

< review>
Best sushi in Mountain View for sure! Very traditional and fresh, really fresh. The hamachi melted in my mouth and the rice was perfectly seasoned. They overdid the size with one of the special rolls with shrimp tempura inside, just ridiculously big, never seen that (not even in Japan), was definitely not a bite size. On the low side: edamame didn't have any salt so they were kind of dull, and the staff is not the most friendly, maybe because it was 8.30 pm on a Saturday night and they wanted to get ready to leave, but still. I'd definitely come back since the sushi was delightful.<//review>

< Review>
Omakase was good and actually had decent portions for the price. Tempura comes in good portions as well. Udon wasn't quite up to par though. This seems like a popular place for dinner so expect to wait a bit. Service was great overall.<//Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Date>1377559964469< /Date><Text>This place is too pricey for what you get. $5 for a bowl of Miso soup when most places will serve that complementary along with dinner.

The quality of the food was fine, but I was expecting a bit better for the price. The service was a teensy bit slow especially considering it wasn't that crowded.

The atmosphere is quite nice and calming, but it tries to pass itself off as a high-end sushi place without delivering. Would likely not go back.< /Text><UserId.>112688966749349879958<//UserId.>< Response>

<Review>One of my favorite Sushi restaurants in the south bay.

It is small so it can be crowded with a wait at peak times. Call ahead if you plan on bringing a large group.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

The food is amazing, the service is quick and worth the wait. The omakase does not disappoint, incredibly fresh cuts- the miso, starter salad and all rolls are delicious. Definitely worth a visit!<//Text>

< review>
Sushitomi is the place to go for fresh fish in Mountain View. While menu items tend toward the pricier side, the quality of ingredients and preparation are distinctive. The restaurant is quite cozy, so be prepared to dine in close quarters. As Sushitomi does not accept reservations, waiting to be seated is basically a given upon arrival. One tip for prospective diners: if you don't mind jostling elbows, applying for a seat at the sushi counter may get in you faster. Service is prompt and polite, though may be slow at times when the restaurant is exceptionally busy.<//review>

No frills sushi restaurant with usually a long wait to seat.
Fish is fresh and good and they have very convenient combination dinners for about $20 which include also Sashimi, Teriaki, Miso Soup and Rice.
Service is nice and fast. Give it a try.</text>

Had a delicious Special Chirashi Sushi bowl and some Toro (salmon belly) Nigiri sushi. Fish was high quality and the sushi rice tasted good. I sat at the sushi bar and the waitress forgot a cup when delivering my sake and I had to ask her to take my order. Even so, very good food and would recommend.<//review>

<Text>GREAT food, so good that the Japanese businessmen are always there ordering gigantic platters of sushi and sashimi; real green tea made from powder / paste and not tea bags; really kind staff.  Only downside: get there early (we do 5:30) because after 6:00 it gets crowded fast.  They also take reservations.< /Text><date>1212519953689</date></record></dataset><record>

Superb sushi. Love their chirashi bowls and lunch combinations. The grilled mackerel (saba) is fantastic. Not a super big space = very long wait if you go during meal rushes, but they also do takeout.<//text>

My most favorite sushi place in the South Bay.

You can find anything from baby octopus, squid, abalone, and other special fishes in addition to the simple salmon and hamachi here. If in doubt, you can never go wrong with any of the daily specials.

The lunch specials are a steal for the freshness and portion size. There are usually 3 varieties - a kama (fish collar), curry, and sushi to choose from. It is accompanied by a salad, rice, and fish with veggies soup.< /review>

< Review>
I have been to Sushi Tomi countless of times, and the sushi always meets the highest standards of quality. This is not a place to enjoy a broad menu of fantasy sushi rolls.  Instead, Tomi is a heaven for purists that cherish the range of flavors of the sea in all their subtlety, prepared in deceptively simple forms of sashimi and nigiri. To this end, the chefs make great use of local seafood and fish flown from Tsukiji, which makes me come back despite the wait and the crowded space. And I return again and again.< /Review>

Ordered the sashimi lunch combo.

Rice, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and one more fish (don't recall).

Came out in a timely manner, fish tasted like it was lightly frozen, but otherwise delicious and fatty.

It was a bit odd that it came with hot rice, but to each their own I suppose.

This location is luckily located near the edge of downtown MVW, as it was brimming full during the lunch hour. Parking should be easier compared to other lunchspots.<//text>< gmap_id>

Tomi is a well known sushi place on Dana st in MV. Older than Google and FB actually ^_^
This is the place for sushi and sashimi. Daily specials are awesome. Be adventurous and let the chef prepares one for you. Drawbacks - The line is always long and parking is hard to find.</Review>

Best sushi place in Mountain View! Opens at 5 pm on Saturday and to get in on the first sitting you need to start queuing at 4:45 pm minimum. Otherwise you will be queuing for sometime.</Text>

Do not recommend. Maybe Im spoiled by the Safeway takeout sushi quality, but I really don't know why there is a line to this place. Overpriced, meh quality, long wait to be seated.  Salmon rolls were made out of minced salmon, and fatty tuna belly roll was minced tuna, but definitely not tuna belly.  Izakaya (broiled skewers - pork belly, shisamo, and chicken skin) seemed boiled, then hit with the butane torch.  Pork was very tough, and shisamo was soggy?!?   Anyways.  Sad to see this place go down hill. Go elsewhere for better food. Nijiya market grocery takeout if you have to.</Review>

I finally managed to get in without waiting in the absurdly long lines that form outside early on a Monday evening. The sashimi was good but the sushi and other food served was unremarkable. In particular the sushi was simplistic and oversized, too large to fit in your mouth. The salad dressing was gross and the fruit was stale. Service was terrible, they forget you're there once you're inside. You can get a better experience at any of the sushi restaurants down the street for half the price. If you want truly good sushi, try Tataki in San Francisco.</Text>

Great sushi but they don't take reservations and there's always a long wait. Wasting people's time benefits no one (-1 star)< /review>

Lunch bento is OK. It would be better if they serve salad with it.<//Text>

A bit pricey but likely the best sushi you can find in town. It get's crowded pretty soon to the point that there is a line even before it opens. It's not too bad but be warned.<//Review>

Easily the best sushi in Mountain View. The wait for tables spilled out onto the street so reservations are recommended. It is however easier for lone diners to get a seat at the bar.<//Text>

We each got the 10pc omakase (comes with miso soup) and a few extra pieces for about $50. Not bad at all! Fish is really really fresh. Good variety too. Fresh octopus is divine. I thought the uni tasted a little off, but maybe it was just an off day. Everything else was delicious. Wait is not too bad since they have quick turnaround.

My most trusted sushi place since I learned to drive in 2005. Don't forget to check the daily specials, which are always a surprise treat. The sashimi portions in the bento combo are also intense.</Review>

Best sushi in mountain view. The line is always long and they don't take reservations though so be wary and be ready to wait a while.</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Update 11/22/2017: dropping a star here. I went back a few weeks ago and was disappointed. The sushi was still good, but not as before. Their unagi-don was served on a round bowl and sort of thrown together, rather than the usual neat arrangement on a rectangular dish. Also, they didn't include the typical pickled veggies that usually come as condiments.

And their chicken karaage was a disaster. Do not get the chicken karaage here. So disappointing. It was just chicken wings, and only the bad part of the wing with almost no meat, and there was no flavor to it at all, just fried. It wasn't boneless, it wasn't tasty, it wasn't karaage.

I'm not planning to go back to this place anytime soon.<//Text><Date>1515876985068</Date><Gmap_id>0x808fb73161d008c9:0xf1ccd9ca251ef04< /Gmap_id><userid>101604168233790549408< /userid>< Rating>

I am not sure why this place has so high ratings! The only thing I can think of is that it is on Castro!
The Uni sashimi is great but the last time I had the Mackerel sushi it was one of the worst I had:(
The line is also huge for getting in and it is a very cramped up place. Would not give it more than 3.5 stars!</review>

The chirashi -- even the "regular" one -- is out of this world.  Fish melts in your mouth and is super-fresh, rice is outstandingly flavored, wasabi (very strong!) and ginger are perfect, and portion is very reasonable for the cost.  Seriously compares with the chirashi I had in Japan.

I ended up just getting it to go this time (it was ready 20 minutes after I phoned in my order).  Saves on having to deal with the very crowded restaurant, but you do miss out on the tea and such :\.</review>

Incompetent service, mediocre sushi. $40 for FOUR pieces of sashimi?

When our (excellent) local sushi place in Los Altos had a problem with their delivery, we (sadly) turned to this place as an alternative using DoorDash.

Unfortunately Sushi Tomi messed up our order and--get this--wouldn't even admit their fault and essentially implied that we were trying to rip them off. In the end they tried to charge us $40 for FOUR pieces of sashimi (instead of the 14 we ordered), and they stuck to their story and wouldn't give an inch. They basically ruined our dinner plans and we had to supplement our it with things we cooked for ourselves.

The food we actually did get was mediocre at best. The fish wasn't very fresh, and the Dragon Roll was sloppily done and PACKED full of MAYONNAISE (yuck!).

For sushi delivery there are many more options. This restaurant clearly doesn't care about their customers.

Don't order from here unless you want to get your money taken from you, and/or you want your dinner plans destroyed, and/or you want sushi that isn't near as good as many other options nearby.<//text>

Definitely one of the better sushi places in this area. The omakase was pretty good but I wish each piece was served on it's own to be slowly enjoyed and paced properly instead of having all pieces come on a plate at once even though I'm sitting at the sushi bar.< /review>

The line is long, and you think "this place must be great."  But, alas, you are wrong.

The place is underwhelming.  Edamame is free, but stale.  You can get better at Costco.

We ordered Sashimi special, sake toro, scallops, salmon roe, and uni.  Miso soup.  Green tea and Sapporo.    The only thing we liked were the scallops, miso, and tea/beer.  The rest was tough, dry, and dull.  One would expect better sushi at  your local supermarket.

I'm willing to give it another shot, if others in my party desire it.  But, honestly, given the higher cost/price, I'd go somewhere else.<//Text>

<review>Easily the best sushi in Mountain View if not the lower Peninsula. Their specials are often fresh-from-Tsukiji in Japan, and their execution is on point. We have gone five or so times, and we have yet to be disappointed by any aspect of their service or meals. We recommend the Chirashi for a medium-to-low priced meal, and the Omakase is unreal. Get the Omakase with two appetizers, and it will feed two comfortably. If going for rolls only, my wife always gets the mackerel and the uni. Really, most any choice, as long as it is predominantly fish and not a mish-mash, is going to be wonderful.

They take credit card, parking is tight, there's often a wait, and you have to sign-up on a list inside the door.<//review>< rate>

- Low quality sushi (vs, say, Sushi Monster in Belmont)
- Super long wait at lunch even though I arrived by 11:45, followed by pestering from staff to order, to eat, and to pay.
- Would not - even though I offered to pay extra - allow me to order sashimi lunch with all hamachi.

+ good location,
+ decent authentic atmosphere (as compared to Sushi places in Tokyo, Osaka, and Okinawa)

Won't go back most likely.<//review>

<review>Really nice little authentic Japanese restaurant tucked into the end of a shopping center on Apopka Vineland and John Young!

This place has high quality Japanese food and a warm and welcoming atmosphere!
*They have really good prices for lunch and reasonable prices for dinner.
Their grilled Mackeral is great (huge half of Mackerel with tail on). It has a great flavor and comes with grated radish, broccoli,  rice, and  miso soup or salad for $11 at lunch and $15 at dinner.  Same portion.
The salmon teriyaki is also really good and the teriyaki sauce is savory and not too sweet. It comes with potato salad, broccoli,  rice, and miso soup or salad for $10 lunch and $15 at dinner.  Portion maybe slightly smaller at lunch.

Their spicy tuna bowl is fantastic!! Chopped pieces of super fresh spicy tuna cover a massive bowl of sushi rice and comes with miso soup or salad for $11 lunch or $16 at dinner. You get a lot of tuna and the portion is the same at lunch and dinner.

At dinner time you get miso soup and house salad for the above dishes.

My favorite appetizer..... fried squid legs! So hot, cripsy, and chewy these things are to die for. They are not always on the white board but if you ask they always seem to have them.  ~$6
The sliced eggplant in garlic soy is also good. ~$6

One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Orlando. Favorite Mackerel at Japanese restaurant in Orlando.

The ramen is good but not amazing like their fish dishes.

The pork katsudon is a great option if you prefer something other than seafood. It is a homestyle dish that is really filling and tasty for $11. A delicately fried pork cutlet with egg over rice with a lightly sweet soy type sauce. Hearty option.

Great local Japanese restaurant!<//review>< resp>

<Text>Incompetent service, mediocre sushi. $40 for FOUR pieces of sashimi?

When our (excellent) local sushi place in Los Altos had a problem with their delivery, we (sadly) turned to this place as an alternative using DoorDash.

Unfortunately Sushi Tomi messed up our order and--get this--wouldn't even admit their fault and essentially implied that we were trying to rip them off. In the end they tried to charge us $40 for FOUR pieces of sashimi (instead of the 14 we ordered), and they stuck to their story and wouldn't give an inch. They basically ruined our dinner plans and we had to supplement our it with things we cooked for ourselves.

The food we actually did get was mediocre at best. The fish wasn't very fresh, and the Dragon Roll was sloppily done and PACKED full of MAYONNAISE (yuck!).

For sushi delivery there are many more options. This restaurant clearly doesn't care about their customers.

Don't order from here unless you want to get your money taken from you, and/or you want your dinner plans destroyed, and/or you want sushi that isn't near as good as many other options nearby.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Their grilled Mackeral is great (huge half of Mackerel with tail on). It has a great flavor and comes with grated radish, broccoli,  rice, and  miso soup or salad for $11 at lunch and $15 at dinner.  Same portion.
The salmon teriyaki is also really good and the teriyaki sauce is savory and not too sweet. It comes with potato salad, broccoli,  rice, and miso soup or salad for $10 lunch and $15 at dinner.  Portion maybe slightly smaller at lunch.

Their spicy tuna bowl is fantastic!! Chopped pieces of super fresh spicy tuna cover a massive bowl of sushi rice and comes with miso soup or salad for $11 lunch or $16 at dinner. You get a lot of tuna and the portion is the same at lunch and dinner.

At dinner time you get miso soup and house salad for the above dishes.

My favorite appetizer..... fried squid legs! So hot, cripsy, and chewy these things are to die for. They are not always on the white board but if you ask they always seem to have them.  ~$6
The sliced eggplant in garlic soy is also good. ~$6

One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Orlando. Favorite Mackerel at Japanese restaurant in Orlando.

The ramen is good but not amazing like their fish dishes.

The pork katsudon is a great option if you prefer something other than seafood. It is a homestyle dish that is really filling and tasty for $11. A delicately fried pork cutlet with egg over rice with a lightly sweet soy type sauce. Hearty option.

Great local Japanese restaurant!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

My benchmark for Japanese in the area. Excellent udon and makis. It gets crowded, and no reservations, but overall worth it.</text>

<review>Not the freshest sashimi I've had, but decently tasty. Price is a bit high for the quality though. I'm also comparing them with sashimi in Japan, so that might be unfair.

Pros:
- tasty sashimi
- bustling Japanese izakaya atmosphere
- fast service

Cons:
- price point is too high
- no Japanese menu<//review>< username>

< review>
Probably my favorite place to get sushi in MV.

It's consistently good, portions are decent, and fish is fresh. It gets packed so make sure you beat the dinner/lunch crowd or you're waiting.

I highly recommend getting their sushi plates or their lunch/dinner combos. This place isn't too big on rolls so there's not a lot of options. I love their nigiri combos because it's the perfect amount of food and the fish is fresh and tasty! Their chirashi bowls also look good but that tends to be too much rice for me. Their lunch/dinner combos are actually pretty filling. I usually get the chicken terriyaki in combination with sashimi or spicy tuna roll. Their chicken is grilled just how I like it, which is to the point you can taste that charred/seared portion of the chicken and they don't go super heavy on the sauce which is nice!

Their prices are a higher than other sushi restaurants in the area but worth it if you're a fan of quality fish.<//review>

Quality fish with a wide selection that most Americans wouldn't be familiar with. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the decor and menus haven't been updated in years.</Text>

Despite the long wait and tight spaces, this place shines as one of the best sushi places in the Bay Area.  The seared salmon is done to perfection, and every roll has not disappointed< /review>

< review>
Probably my favorite place to get sushi in MV.

It's consistently good, portions are decent, and fish is fresh. It gets packed so make sure you beat the dinner/lunch crowd or you're waiting.

I highly recommend getting their sushi plates or their lunch/dinner combos. This place isn't too big on rolls so there's not a lot of options. I love their nigiri combos because it's the perfect amount of food and the fish is fresh and tasty! Their chirashi bowls also look good but that tends to be too much rice for me. Their lunch/dinner combos are actually pretty filling. I usually get the chicken terriyaki in combination with sashimi or spicy tuna roll. Their chicken is grilled just how I like it, which is to the point you can taste that charred/seared portion of the chicken and they don't go super heavy on the sauce which is nice!

Their prices are a higher than other sushi restaurants in the area but worth it if you're a fan of quality fish.</review>

< review>
Pro:
Long, but fast line
Above average sushi
Really good salmon

Con:
Teriyaki chicken was bland and no grilled flavor
Greasy shrimp tempura
Too much rice on the sushi
Bit over priced

6/10</review>

The presentation isn't always fancy, but the sushi and dons are always delicious here. This is my favorite sushi place in Mountain View.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It's super delicious, the tempura is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are also many kinds of vegetables. The fried shrimp is delicious. Although there are often long queues, it is worth a try! Big push!

超好吃，天婦羅外酥內軟，蔬菜也很多種，炸蝦好吃，雖然常常大排長龍，但很值得一試！大推！<//review>

(Translated by Google) The price is not expensive, especially there are many lunch boxes to choose from at noon. The box will be served with miso soup, and a cup of cold oolong tea is great. There is a bar in the restaurant where sushi chefs can make sushi.

(Original)
價格不貴，尤其是中午有很多種lunch box可以選擇，晚來就要排隊等候位了！選box都會附上味噌湯，再加點一杯冰涼的烏龍茶非常棒，店內有吧台可以看壽司師傅製作壽司。</review>

First of all, the five kinds of sashimi are very fresh and have a good taste. One of them has a taste like black tuna, and the crispy texture in the chicken skin is good. It is a Japanese restaurant that is highly recommended.

今天點了晚餐豪華生魚片組合跟照燒烤雞肉套餐。首先五種生魚片都很新鮮口感很好，其中有一款魚有類黑鮪魚入口即化的感覺，雞皮處裡的酥脆口感不錯，值得大力推薦的日本料理店。< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Chinese people are cautious. At noon today, four of us sat down for five minutes and were preparing to order food. Several white bosses actually rushed us to the table in the corner to give the newly-born Teng table to the whites. When I saw that there was an empty table for a long time, the Chinese were the guest table, and the customer was divided into three or six.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I went to this Japanese restaurant today and I almost didn't get pissed off... Obviously there was a table available, but we were allowed to sit on the bar table. As soon as we sat down, an American in the back sat at an empty table for four people. It’s okay to sit on the bar. We just sat down and found out that it was freezing to death at the door... Then we asked them to help change the table. The clerk told us that it was impossible because there was no table. We were speechless...but my friend still ordered the meal. I didn't dare to eat a bite. In the end, I didn't order anything. I was really afraid of being revenge... This is too flattering, a good table for the Americans, it's a net bully for us. Chinese... When I said I was going to wait for the table, they also ordered me to say that I could not sit at the bar table, but the two of us obviously ordered a meal, why can't I sit down! !

(Original)
今天去了这个日本餐馆，差点没被气死…明明有可用的桌子不告诉我们，却让我们坐bar台，我们刚坐下，就让后面的一个美国人坐了四个人的空桌子。坐bar台也没关系，我们就坐了，做下了才发现，对着门口，简直冻的要死啊…然后我们说让她们帮忙换桌子，店员跟我们说不可能，因为没有桌子。我们直接无语…不过我朋友还是点了饭吃，我是一口都不敢吃了，最后什么都没点，真怕被报复…这也太崇洋媚外了，好桌子给美国人，净欺负我们这些中国人… 当我说我要等桌子的时候她们还勒令我说我不可以坐在bar台的座位等，可是我们两个人明明有一个人点了餐，我怎么就不能坐下来了！！</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I thought the review of Yerp was very good, so I thought there was no loss, but the service was good-everyone felt good!
At lunch, the sashimi and beef territory combo and friends set off with sashimi. The sashimi was also cut large and thick. I like the taste! !
No, I want to go there every day! !

イエルプのレビューが大変良いのでハズレないと思って行ったけどサービス良かったですねーみんな感じがよい！
ランチで鯖塩とビーフテリのコンボと友達は刺身定食。刺身も結構大きく厚く切ってありました。お味も私好み！！

<review>(Translated by Google) For the United States, ume-bamboo sushi is offered on a standard menu (about $ 30) in Japan. I think it's relatively reasonable at around $ 50.
