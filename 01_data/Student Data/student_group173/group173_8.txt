We got ribs, boneless and traditional wings, fries, bread sticks and everything  was delicious! The sauces were very flavorful.  Highly recommend</Text>

< review>
The food here is pretty good. Their Buffalo chicken fries are really good and you can order them in different sizes. Their service here is not good ... especially during the day time hours the employees are mostly rude and not very happy to deal with customers. There is room for improvement.< /review>

Went for a pickup today. Don't know much about other things or food. All I know is my husband enjoyed his salt and pepper chicken wings. Now keep in mind, he ate it after an hour. So I'd say the quality must be pretty good to hold up for that long.<//Text>

<Text>This place gets a 5 all day.  Can not go wrong with anything you order.  But if I could make up your mind for you, I would get some pulled pork fries to start off anything. I will be coming back anytime I'm in town.

I love their wings. They are good size and they fry them so they have a good crunch. The people are nice and they always have sports playing on the TV.<//Text>

<Text>WARNING STAY AWAY :
This place is not ethical at all they are thieves, made and order through Uber eats found that my gift card was not accepted, canceled the order immediately and then got a message saying that this place was still going to charge my credit card, called the bunch of thieves asked them since they charged me can I just come pick up my order they refused to let me get my order told me to call Uber eats???? You charged me already let me get what I paid for???? Terrible place and don’t use Uber eats either they refused to give me a refund also.<//Text><rating>1</rating><gmapID>0x80d959725f856879:0x1cb53bb70184b694</gmapID>< Pictures>

Very expensive for wings, very basic to much money for just chicken wings. Cost as much as Outback steak house next door for simple take out.</Text>

Never coming back. The cashier in the front was a very heavy set guy which I have no problem with. However I bring that up because this guy was the most disgusting guy I've ever met. His fingers and clothes were dirty. He was on his phone playing a game while we were trying to order, I had to repeat my order twice because he wasn't paying attention. After we ordered he was eating loud and licking his fingers. I was so disgusted I didn't eat my food after. I just felt sick to my stomach. I know all these reviews saying it's a great place but if you happen to walk in and there's a really heavy set guy that comes off rude and weird... Walk out! Trust me. Never again will I come back.<//text>

Coupons were messed up and then missing some of my order i tried calling 4 20 min and it was busy the whole time so I had to drive back down there and they gave me what I was missing but didnt even bother offering n e thing for forgetting 2 give me my whole order or having to drive back down there 👎 I wont go back again  hope everyone else has a better experience.

Portions are rather Small for the price they charge. Chicken strips were more like small chicken chunks. I gave 2 stars because the place was clean and staff were friendly enough.</text>

I love going to the 740 Jamacha Road, El Cajon, CA 92019 location. That's where you'll find me almost any day of the week. I drive to this location and there is one in walking distance from me.</Text>

This is the best place to get wings in San Diego!! You will never be disappointed! The staff is extremely friendly, the wait is very reasonable and well worth it. Their wings and sauce choices are to die for and their sides are also as good. My favorite has to be their Teriyaki wings, most places I order from seem to be really salty. These were made to perfection with love sprinkled in. Oh and don't get me started on their fresh baked breadsticks!!!!<//Review>

This place gets a 5 all day.  Can not go wrong with anything you order.  But if I could make up your mind for you, I would get some pulled pork fries to start off anything. I will be coming back anytime I'm in town.< /Text>

This is the worst wing place I've ever been to. I went and spent 10.50 on the fries the Chicken tasted horrible like rubber very nasty and chewy. I called and the man told me it was nothing he could do about it so no lunch for me wow the worst food and Customer Service ever pls save your money and go elsewhere.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>If I could give this place a less than zero I would. This is the wings next to outback steak out on Jamacha. This place has the worst service ever. We tried to order wings for a party, we needed them to be ready by 2pm. When we got there, they hadn’t even started the wings yet, the man at the register looked at me like I was asking something absurd, he said had you come in for a deposit they would have been ready, however he called to confirm with us this morning “ yes we need these by 2pm we can’t be late our party.” He said of course no problem. I had asked him to run my card over the phone  and he said it was ok he will ring us when we got there.  So we get there and no wings, they hadn’t even started the catering size wings and we have to wait over 20 mins with screaming kids in the car...he could give a rats ass ...we were late... there was zero sense of urgency ...the customer service was the worst I’ve ever experienced. He could have said he forgot and taken some accountability. I will never give this place business again.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Here the food is alright but the customer service is really bad. Chicken pieces fell on me and my clothes while the staff was bringing the food and he showed no concern of that and that proofs that they don’t take care of their customers.< /text>

If I could post a negative number it would be minus 5 .... the wing were terrible(tough like cooked in microwave) the other fried foods I bought were also terrible mozzarella sticks were in edible. I spent almost 50.00 and was very unsatisfied. Never going back.... and I do not recommend this place to anyone ‼️< /review>

Everytime I go the staff just seems like they don't care about giving good customer service at all. Really unimpressed with the buffalo fries too which are bomb anywhere else. There was a small scoop of chicken on a mountain of fries and hardly any sauce. Not to mention the chicken that I was able to get was dry af and too tough to chew. Ended up not even finishing my food. 🖓 😞< /review>< Date>

< Review>
Me and my boyfriend went in this evening and the guy who rang us up was on his cell phone watching something or who even knows but seemed bothered by US enterupting him even tho WE were the costumers just trying to place a order. We sat down and we're seconds from walking out the guy that rang us up was stuffing his face with anything he could find licking his fingers slapping his lips over and over it was disgusting! Two girls walked in to pick u there order and I watched to see how he acted and he did the same with them, not even looking at them handing them their food. They seemed weirded out also. When our food was ready we didn't even wanna touch it after this guy was just licking his fingers in front of us. We didn't even want our food let alone wil ever come back.</Review>

Dr. Lee knows what he’s doing and compassionate, he did examine and found all the problems that caused my severe pain, he also listen to patient concerns and advise appropriate course of actions. My experience with roots canal and molar extraction were great.

Extremely grateful to find Dr. Lee and his staff. They are prof, informative and kind. I'd definitely recommend LA center to anyone who need its service.< /text>

Extremely professional and friendly atmosphere.
The staff were efficient and knew every detail of my case and needed services. The Doctor, Dr. Park,  was expert in his knowledge and skill. This Dr. was a pro among pros and they used state of the art equipment in providing what was needed for me.
Set my mind at ease and explained in detail every procedure that was being performed on me(Root Canals). The mystery was clarified and pain was virtually, minimal. Also quick and efficient in delivery of the procedures. I highly recommend Dr. Park and the staff at LA Center For Endodontic Services should you ever need Root Canal procedures performed.<//text>

<text>Excellent and friendly staff, it was super easy to make an appointment.
Dr. Mindo Lee is such a professional in his field!  I liked that he was very honest and I didn’t feel forced into a decision I would not be comfortable with - he thoroughly explained the procedure, the recovery from it and what were the chances it would be successful, (in my case it was retreatment of my infected root canal) so you know what to expect.
He was able to save my tooth by performing retreatment (couple dentists before him were saying that I absolutely needed to extract it). Needless to say I was very glad I didn’t listen to them and came to Los Angeles Center For Endodontics.
Now it’s all healed and I couldn’t be any happier! Thank you, definitely would recommend this clinic.</text><Name>Yulia Puzanova< /Name>< user_id>

Dr Lee is the only endodontist that my trusted, long time dentist recommended for my root canal.  After my experience today I can see why he is so highly regarded.
Dr. Lee is an excellent, highly skilled endodontist.  Despite my complicated dental anatomy that made my case challenging, my procedure was quick, efficient, and surprisingly pain free.  His staff is professional and friendly, and there’s plenty of free parking on site.
I highly recommend Dr. Lee and staff.</Text>

I would come back here & see Dr. Mindo Lee, he’s a great listener & was able to put my anxious self at ease, which I greatly appreciated. He took the time to explain everything he would be doing before & during my procedure. Anytime he noticed I was in any type of discomfort he would stop, reassess, and make sure I didn’t feel a thing. His staff was very knowledgeable efficient & friendly.Thank you to you & your staff for your great care!</Text>

It was the early morning on MLK holiday, 1/18/ 21 when I called this place for an appointment.  I was very pleased with the timing and the service with this Dentistry. They scheduled me about one hour after I called them for an appointment.  It took about another hour for Dr. Lee to finish the Endodontic treatment on my tooth. So it took around 2 or 2 1/2 hours from the time I called to schedule the appointment to when I was done with the root canal treatment.
Dr. Lee was very courteous and professional.< /Review>

<Text>I was very impressed with Dr. Lee and his staff.  They were very professional, efficient and friendly.  The office was very clean and they adhere to all safety precautions during the current Coronavirus pandemic which really helped put my mind at ease.

Though I live in the Valley, and the office is in Koreatown, I highly recommend Dr. Lee.  After doing extensive research, I went to Dr. Lee because I needed a qualified Endodontist and was not disappointed.  It is always hard to trust strictly based on Yelp or Google reviews since you never know who is writing them.  But Dr. Lee is by far the best Endodontist I have ever been to and is well worth the drive.  They even have Saturday appointments available which makes things very convenient if you work during the week.  In addition, they have a parking structure, at no charge, that provides ample parking and each level has direct access to the building.

I had to get a root canal retreatment on 01/29/21 of my front upper right tooth (also known as the #8 tooth).  In addition, I had developed an infection above the tooth that needed to be cleaned out as well.  It had been over 30 years since my last root canal and had to be completely redone.  Dr. Lee was very patient and thorough in discussing all of the 3 options as to how to accomplish this.  And while the option I chose meant that the whole process would overall take longer than I would have hoped, it also provided me with the best chance of success in getting it fixed right in one shot rather than repeated procedures.

With any dental surgery there is always the fear of pain, and especially how much one might experience.  During the procedure I did not experience any pain aside from the 2 stings of when he injected the Novocain which is to be expected.  In less than an hour, he had completed the procedure including the cleaning out of the infection.  As I was checking out, he even provided Ibuprophen to help with the swelling and pain that eventually did come after the Novocain wore off.  However, I was already prepared for this since I knew he had had to go deeper to clear out all of the infection.  The pain throughout the weekend was easily managed by Ibuprophen, and as I write this 3 days later, I am back to normal.

I truly appreciated Dr. Lee and his staff for all of their help in fixing my tooth and highly recommend them if you are in need of an excellent Endodontist!<//Text><resp>None< /resp><pics>None</pics><date>1612206163887< /date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I was referred to Los Angeles Center for Endodontics for an emergency root canal during the quarantine. They were quick to set up an appointment with me and were very clear about my insurance coverage and copay. Dr. Stephen Park was kind and quick with the procedure. The root canal was painless and the atmosphere of the office and staff definitely made the experience more manageable! It’s been two days since the root canal and I am pain-free. Thank you LA Center for Endodontics! I highly recommend this office if you are in need of a root canal.<//Review>< Pics>

When you're in pain from a root canal, this is the place you want to go. They're so friendly and caring, and even helped me out with insurance-related miscommunications, both times I've been there. They really listen to the patient.<//review>

Melissa at the front desk was efficient. When I emailed her my x-rays prior to my visit, she let me know that she had received them. She promptly emailed me back my treatment plan, including costs. The costs were surprisingly reasonable; in the end I even paid much less than the treatment plan's estimate.
The front desk ladies were nice.
Dr. Lee was very pleasant and encouraged me to try to save the tooth with a root canal rather than an extraction and implant. I was hoping that he could do the work that day and he did. It was quick and painless. Afterward, I never felt any pain at all. Be advised: after the root canal, you must return to your regular dentist and get a crown to cover that tooth. That is more expensive, so you may want to find out that cost in advance. I wasn't aware of that. Dr. Lee was kind, quick, and painless.< /review>

Office is renovated to meet new pandemic standards. Lobby controlled by having patients wait in car until soothing, comfortable room with Zeiss Microscopes, Pelton & Crane Chairs, Obtura Spartan Delivery System is ready. Dr. Lee was trained at Uni of Pennsylvania studying under one of endodontics founders, Dr. I.B. Bender.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>These Drs are definitely the best in the SoCal region. Dr park has been very patient with details during my time here. He was able to explain everything that needed to be done and did everything with ease. I felt very comfortable walking in and confident walking out.

Please give them a visit. The whole place is clean, friendly staff and can accommodate you in every way. There’s also a parking structure in the building so no need to worry about that. You will be taken care of here. Thanks again!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Thank you so much for treating my tooth!!! I had the worst pain in the past few months and needed a root canal... during the time of quarantine it was extremely hard to find a doctor, I tried several clinics before  which didn’t seem professional and the staff was rude and trying to trick me with my insurance payment. Although LA Center For Endodontics were very welcoming and professional. They scheduled my appointment very fast and already less than a week after my first visit I had my root canal done easy and stress free. I really appreciate the professional doctors that were taking care of me and the rest of the staff. Also the office itself was very clean and they follow all the Covid-19 guidelines... Recommended!!!<//Text>< pics>

In one visit Dr Park had it all repaired. So friggin grateful to him. I would recommend this place to EVERYONE!!! Everything about my experience was 5 star. These guys really know there stuff!!!</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Lee and his staff are beyond amazing. 5 star treatment as soon as I entered his office til I stepped out. My procedure was Thoroughly explained in full detail and he made me feel comfortable. I had next to no pain after the procedure and pretty much zero in recovery time. Highly recommended.< /Text>

<Text>I was referred to Dr. Lee by a friend and I am extremely appreciative of their excellent  customer service along with top notch professionalism, especially during Covid-19. All precautions are taken very seriously. Every person starting from the front desk receptionists leading back to the patient room with Dr. Lee and his two amazing dental assistants are extremely patient, kind and comforting throughout the entire process. They show genuine concern for your comfort and interests and will kindly walk you through your procedure with clear details and provide you with great treatment options. If you are deciding whether to choose Dr. Mindo Lee as your Endodontics dentist, please go right ahead and do so. You won’t be disappointed.</Text>< user_id>

Dr. Mindo Lee he is a angel come from the heaven.
I am very thankful with him because he open my eyes today and took away all the fear and panic I have on me since I was a child. I wasn't even a regular patient of him and he went out of her way to help me in my panic mode. You can bet I am now her regular patient. Thanks Dr. Mindo Lee

I've never written a google review in my life, but this place clearly deserves 5 stars, so I had to! Absolutely wonderful staff in the front office and the back staff too especially Dr. Lee and Alex . I had to have an emergency root canal, today and Dr. Lee was so patient and helpful he explain everything before doing it. DR. LEE IS THE BEST ENDODONTICS IN LA. Everyone in the office really helped me stay calm and went above and beyond in making sure I felt better. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you're looking for a new dentist- go here! I highly recommend them to anyone.< /Text>

Dr. Lee is the BEST endodontis with a heart to his patient and have an amazing and wonderful staff.  Thank you Dr. Lee for not giving up my case even to the point that I myself want to give up. My case is a complicated one and it’s a challenge to you and your staff. You did everything that you could do to help ease my pain. I’m painless now as if nothing happen. I would highly recommend Dr. Lee to my family and friends. If I ever need another root canal and other dental problem I will definitely go back to him.<//Text>

I booked Dr Lee, last minute and he was willing to take me the same day. I'll be honest I was pretty skeptical when I walked into the building, however their office is very nice and the receptionist was welcoming. This was actually one of my best dental experiences I've ever had! I walked in with a terrible toothache and left without so much as an ounce of pain. Dr Lee was a wizard with the needle and I never even felt so much as pinch from the numbing shots, let alone any discomfort during my root canal procedure. I will definitely be recommending him to my friends and family in need, and should I ever need another root canal, I'll definitely be coming back to him.< /text>

Dr. Lee is hands down the best endodontist I have ever been treated by. He is a true expert endodontist! I needed a root canal after waking up with excruciating sharp shooting pains. I immediately called LA Center for Endodontics and was quickly scheduled to come in to see Dr. Lee. As soon as I left his office, my excruciating pain and pressure was literally eliminated, totally gone!! The procedure itself was actually painless and quick. I had no idea that any of this was even possible. I was waiting for the pain to creep back but it never did. He's a miracle worker... if you ever need a root canal then I cannot recommend LA Center for Endodontics highly enough. It is a stretch to say that having a root canal is a pleasant experience but I can confidently say that having my root canal done with Dr Lee was the best dental experience I've ever had! His staff is awesome, his office is really nice, the office has an attached parking structure with complimentary parking and he is a skillful master so you're in the best hands for your treatment which matters  most.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I just want to say, I hate going to the dentist. However, Dr. Lee made me feel so comfortable, I practically fell asleep in the chair! I came in for a root canal which already had me anxious and nervous because I've never had one. Dr. Lee reassured me and even made my nervous self laugh. His anesthesia procedure was painless. His staff were all nice and they all seemed to get along perfectly with each other. Overall, best endodontist I've ever had and an amazing, wonderful staff. Thanks Dr. Lee! Hope you had a great Christmas!</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The visit was off to a rough start (some administrative issues with the receptionist), but the procedure was pretty much trouble-free and professional as can be hoped for with a root canal, and finished within about an hour. Prices are in line with other specialists, leaning towards the lower end of the spectrum. I would not hesitate to recommend them.</text>

Had an beyond AMAZING first time experience with Dr. Lee. He knows what he's doing! His staff and he are the sweetest and extremely kind people I've met going into a dentist/endodontist office. I had my first ever root canal done, painfree also, and I'm pleased to say I went to the right people! Highly recommend Dr. Lee!<//Review>

<Review>My tax preparer Kenneth Feldman handled my taxes with 100 % complete professionalism.🧑🏽‍💻
He was not only very knowledgeable 🤓🧑‍🏫about the entire process  but he was super friendly & easy to talk to, he also got me the maximum 💰 amount on my refund(:
I ended up not having to pay anything except the initial cost of the visit which was very reasonably priced ( especially considering the large amount of my refund) 😁😸✅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.
God Bless America 🇺🇸 & God bless Jackson Hewitt and the fine, awesome individuals who assist there.
I will certainly always use Jackson Hewitt for all of my future tax preparations.
Ps. I also got a Jackson Hewitt ‘Serve’ card ( through American 🇺🇸 Express), which I was thrilled about.
Now I will have my refund electronically wired to my new card. 💳
I’m stoked 😸😁🤲🏽🙌.
100 % satisfied.
Thank you 🙏 🙂</Review>< Pictures>

Place is awesome! You can get almost anything. Came in for some cleats and they have the size I want. Staff is friendly and willing to help. Please was well organized and you can find almost anything.

However, sadly the place is going out of business now and will be closing soon. They are currently having a 30% off sales so stop by and get what you need!< /review>

Good place for a quick grab of stuff you are looking for. The only problem I had was finding the right shoe size, which I could not get hold of :( May be I went in when most stock got exhausted.

Overall a decent place for finding stuff you need for travel and weekend get away plans.< /review>

I went shopping for a gel seat cover for an exercise cycle. The store's person was very helpful, explaining the different types of seats available and the one that would work best for me. The prices seemed reasonable.</review>

<Review>Decent product selection, not the best prices for sure. Several items displayed without prices, hard to find staff to help you figure it out. WOrked out fine because it was a week day, but overall not the greatest shopping experience. Impossible to try sunglasses on without staff supervizing you, not tennis racket trial program....A whole lot could be done to make the experience a whole lot better. Still a place where you'll find most of the stuff you need.<//Review><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>113726562881744276817<//UserId.>< Rating>

This place is always a disappointment.  Horrible selection, poor quality goods, bad prices and many products are displayed without a listed price at all.  Virtually no helpful staff at all in the whole place.  I would only go here to get some Under Armor shirts and pants and that's about all it's useful for.< /review>

<Text>I'd say it's relatively over-priced. Even with the whole going out of sale thing going on, it's no wonder they're going out of business. I'd skip it and go to big 5 or shop online. Pretty sure prices are better online.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808fb66507b8c55f:0x424fa3303c71cd67<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

About to go away. It doesn't typically have the best of deals, but at least it has better selections than Target does when it comes to sports.<//Text>

<Review>These guys suck!

Overpriced, rude and bad customer service. When I called up with questions about returns, this girl called Joanna was just plain rude and hung up. I kept calling back but she kept hanging up as soon as she recognized my voice.

Complete BS! I'm never buying anything from here ever again!<//Review><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

Flavio and Raj are amazing!! This was by far the best customer service I’ve received in a long time. From the moment we came through the door, they were extremely attentive and focused on meeting on our needs. They went above and beyond and I’m happy to say that I’m now a proud owner of an iPhone 12 ProMax. Awesome job guys!! Thank you!</Review>

<Review>After 15+ years with sprint, I have left to Verizon . All because T-Mobile and sprints merge is such a mess that no employees have the same answer or Information on any issues or questions you have. There was no professionalism at this location. Not to mention that while I was there, I witnessed two other separate customers leave very upset at the service they received which didn't seem to surprise any of the employees there. Not only does T-Mobile service need improvement, so does their employees. Oh, and apparently the answer to why they have so many issues is because the "merger" isn't complete. That should not affect the customer. I'm so glad I left T-Mobile /Sprint!</Review><Response>{'time': 1626884350057, 'text': 'We pride ourselves on providing an awesome experience and I would love to hear more.

Flavio or (favio), a younger team-member from this location was great and diligently getting my request done! He quickly activated my new phone Best Buy provided to me due to my old iPhone being completely shattered. I unfortunately went to a location T-mobile garden grove and was provided wrong information stating they couldn’t activate it and provide me my service, that Flavio confirmed was incorrect.
I’m so glad I met him! He was awesome! If I could give 10000000 stars I would! Thank you!<//review>

Flavio has the patience of a saint. He sat with me for literally 4 hours to answer every single question I have had for 2 years. Looking forward to my new top of the line device he hooked me up with. Ask for Flavio👍</Review>

I was stressed bc I didn’t have my physical debit card with me as it was stolen and he really went above and beyond to help me. Raj was thorough and helpful and I cannot imagine how I dealt with other phone dealers in the past. In addition, I have sprint and came here knowing the Tmobile and sprint merger.

I had the pleasure of being helped by the great T-Mobile experts at this location. Neph, especially, went above and beyond for my mother and I when we went in to purchase new phones. He was very patient and explained everything clearly. I had to order my phone, so it was delivered to me. ..Neph offered to help set-up my new phone once I received it, so I went back in and the service provided was exceptional! The entire team was helpful and also welcoming! I would rate more than 5 stars if given the option!</Text>

<name>Linda Grant</name><Review>The representative Anthony was very helpful when I had gone to other stores for help driving all over the place, and I ended up coming to my favorite store, because they have GREAT employees. As per Anthony, he was so helpful when I was frustrated and nothing was going right, until I came into the sprint store and found Anthony who was able to solve all the problems. He took a lot of his time and made me feel special, and solved all of my problems, leaving me completely satisfied. Therefore, Anthony is a great asset to the Sprint company. :)</Review><GmapID>0x80dcdf85f84e9869:0xc10b326817581c9e<//GmapID>< Rating>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Horrible - I was looking to change carriers and ended up at this Sprint store in December.  The sales rep sold me.   I was promised an affordable plan.  $200 deposited into my credit union account and $100 mastercard for every line I imported into sprint.   I was told I had to buy insurance for all four lines and I had to upgrade to a more expensive plan on all four lines to get the master card deal. That was the sales guy up-selling me and telling me a lie.  Turns out I never had to buy insurance (total insurance fraud)   And I only had to upgrade one phone line not all four to get the master card deal.  Another  lie.      I did finally receive the $200 into my credit union account after hours on the phone with sprint getting it worked out.  To get the Mastercards i have  honestly spent 6 hours on the phone with Sprint trying to get them.  Every time I call it takes 1 1/2 - 2 hours and i think its resolved then I get an email saying it's invalid.  Then I spend another 2 hrs on the phone and I received 3 out of the four.  Another 2 hours on the phone and I'm promised the fourth one.    It's been a nightmare to get something that I should never have had to call about.   Save yourself hours of time and go somewhere else.  I will never recommend Sprint to anyone.  It's been a complete nightmare.  They promise the moon and then they don't deliver.     Oh yeah.. and when you call Sprint make sure you call back because whatever they told you they were going to do they don't.  I called cancelled the insurance.  Called back a week later checking and guess what.  It was never cancelled and they had no record of the call.     Said they would credit me back for all the trouble.  once again.  No record of that call either!</text>< pics>

<review>When my phone stopped working a week before the Thanksgiving holiday, I called Sprint Customer care and asked for a new replacement phone. I was promised to have one overnighted to me. After an agonizing week of being without a phone and numerous phone calls that I made to Sprint, I finally walked into this store the day after Thanksgiving. Kelley and her manager Peter spent few hours to find a way to get me a replacement phone right then. Although they knew that they were not going to make any money off of me, Kelly patiently spent hours to retrieve my data and other information from my dead phone. Kevin, their Androidman, Brian, Peter and Kelley are amazing group of people that go out of their way to help everyone.
Thank you guys for offering me such an exceptional experience with your service!< /review>< pics>

<review>I made an appointment online ahead of time to change my account details. Little did I know, this store could not even help me with what I needed, and the staff lacked basic customer service skills so I ended up waiting 20 minutes after my set appointment time just to find out that I needed to find to another location because this one wasn't a corporate store. The sprint appointment system is also stupid for letting this happen, but that's a separate matter.

I get that they were all busy helping other people when I came in so I don't expect that they would stop what they're doing just to help me (even though I made an appointment). But not one person even acknowledged my presence to do a simple greeting or ask what I was in for. I sat at an empty counter right by one of the associates for about 15-20 minutes. Another staff person appeared, seemed to answer some question over the phone, then proceeded to go to the back without even addressing either myself or the other gentleman waiting the store. I had to keep waiting after this other gentleman was helped because he arrived before me. While he didn't take very long to be helped, it just affirmed that making an appointment was completely useless.

Tl;dr
Making an appointment for this store is pointless when the staff don't even bother to use it. Don't come here if you need to make changes to your account.< /review>< Pics>

Awesome service. I had tried dealing with the insurance company 5 times and thought my head would explode if I tried again. Decided to go in to see if someone there could help me. Walked in and was greeted immediately by Daniel Z. He got on the phone with insurance and had it all worked out within 20 minutes maybe less. He went through a couple of people on the phone and didn't give up until he had it worked out. Thanks again Daniel Z you're a life saver and Sprint is lucky to have you!< /Text>

I’m still in disbelief after visiting this store.. I wanted to get two new iPhones and switch from AT&T to Sprint. They told me I would have a deposit per line plus 150 per iPhone which I had absolutely no problem with. I had my wallet on standby and was happy to pay and all of a sudden they decided they didn’t want to sell any phones to me because I have only been with AT&T for 2 months... I’m sure another store would have helped but after this experience there is no way I would want to switch to sprint. I suppose in some ways I am thankful to have had this experience before paying my hard earned money and being disappointed further on down the road. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time or money with Sprint!<//Text>

DO NOT SHOP HERE!
They will lie to you and not tell you about hidden fees when your bill arrives.
Do not believe their “free accessories “ scam , they will end up charging you in your bill and then say you have to sign up for auto pay to get a discount.
I was told I would pay a specific monthly total for my plan  and even changed my phone # to get that deal  only to find out my total was  way over that amount . Went to confront the guy who LIED to me ( named Brian by the way) and they told me the only way to get the price the sales person told me was to cancel my insurance and sign up for auto pay -_- not even sure if this is true or not but I am done with sprint and their scamming sales people.<//text>

<text>DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION IF YOU HAVE SPRINT! This is not a sprint company store and they will not give you current sprint offers. They changed my plan without asking and really screwed me over with the sprint company. 0/5. you will get a bad deal and they will mess with your account. Also I do not trust them with my personal information. Go to a sprint company store instead.<//text>< Date>

This store is full of liars and terrible customer service. John P convinced my wife and I to upgrade our phones with a promise of us receiving 200 dollars per phone. We never received our money and had to call numerous times to customer support and go into the store only to get the run around. They concluded by only giving us 100 dollars per line by stating it must have been a communication error. The employees here are shady and would never survive in an actual job. I will still be contacting Sprint to have the issue reviewed but We will definitely be opting out of our contracts at the earliest opportunity due to their disloyalty to customers and flat out bad service.< /text>

Background:
I recently lost my phone and for the last month I've been shopping around for a new one. I'm off contract so I was thinking about switching carriers. I checked out Verizon, T-mobile, Virgin, and AT&T. I went to a handful of physical locations and called others. I'm on a budget but also very tech savvy so I've been shopping around. It was stressful trying to get a deal and I was constantly being badgered by upselling sales people. I've had some really bad experiences and that's what inspired to write this positive review. If you're looking at this yelp review you are probably in the same boat.

Experience:
This store was so different and it's because of the staff. Ricardo and Robert were easily the best sales reps and I've talked to dozens recently. They were so knowledgeable, down to earth and very clear. They took the time and explained how all the different plans worked and what phones were applicable then found me the best deal. They were so patient with all of my questions and really tailored the experience for me to get me the best deal. I am super appreciative on how patient and attentive they were to me. Other places (rhymes with horizon) pressured me so hard and I got uncomfortable and left. The other places were visibly agitated with me when I wanted time and this experience wasn't like that. It was a no pressure environment that tailored my experience to my needs and I would easily recommend this store to anyone. To be honest, I didn't even think I would try out Sprint but the service and prices really did it for me. 10/10

TL;DR: Awesome sales reps (Ricardo and Robert) who were super patient and knowledgeable. They got me the perfect plan/phone for my budget (college student). No headaches from upselling pushy sales reps and confusing deals, unlike some other places. 10/10 experience and I would recommend them to my family, friends, and coworkers without skipping a beat.

PS: It was actually cheaper than craigslist/ebay/swappa. Very nice!< /Text>

The staff at this establishment will lie for each other in order to get additional sales and take your money.
Be warned that it is a third-party store. So if you have any issues it is practically impossible to get them resolved with sprint customer service. You will have to spend hours on the phone being transferred numerous times to figure anything out.
The sales people are aggressive and dishonest. Ricardo is the one that sold me my plan, and he lied from minute one. I should have been more aware of what was happening and realized immediately that he was lying, but I was confused by all of the conflicting information given to me. I've been into the store numerous times to try to resolve numerous issues, all to no avail. The most recent time I went in I was on the phone with Sprint customer service and they suggested that I go drive down to the store to resolve my issue there. I had something I needed to return, that I didn't need in the first place and was sold to me under false pretense. The customer service representative had called the store on my behalf and asked if there was a manager available. She was told yes. When I got there, The manager was there, a guy whom I recognized. I had asked for a manager numerous times upon other visits to that store. During those other visits the sales people in that store lied to me and told me there was no manager available. The guy that I recognize, that was the manager, was there almost every time I was in that store. So basically they lied and told me that the manager was just another employee. I could see it on his face when he got caught. His name is Peter. He is also aggressive and dishonest.
Ricardo then came out from another counter approached me and started calling me a liar and telling me that I have a bad memory and that I need to get my story straight. I was still on the phone with customer service and ask them if they could please call me back on my cell phone because I felt threatened by Ricardo and the aggressive sales people. She was able to do that and I left the store.
This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Very bizarre and upsetting. Save yourself the stress and go elsewhere.<//Text>

This sprint location is horrible!!!!!! I already have a solo tablet plan with sprint and simply wanted to add a phone I already own and transport a number over. I walked in the store no one ever introduced themselves nor gave a name. My problem was that they were trying to charge me $35 just to activate my phone. I said ok just add it to my bill. Then the manager proceeds to come over to the desk and say that sprint doesn’t offer adding the activation fee to your account because it’s an upgrade?????? Which I was very confused by because my phone was already bought and paid for from verizon. So basically they were trying to scam me into paying an upgrade fee when I wasn’t even upgrading a phone I was bringing my own device and number to port over...
Don’t ever come to this store location on harbour and 19th street in Costa Mesa..  they will do nothing but try to scam money from you and have you pay for things that should just be added to your bill which tells me they’re just taking people’s money for no reason. Please stay away from this place. It’s not even a real sprint location it’s personally owned. Shame on the scam artist that owns this location. I even had a sprint representative call and she then said I can turn in my phone for account credit and upgrade to a new phone and they would apply that to my bill????? So you can’t apply a random $35 charge to my bill but if I got a brand new phone I wouldn’t have to pay anything today and they would apply it to my bill.. so they will apply a couple hundred dollars in phone charges but not a $35 fee... that is just a scam and most importantly it’s wrong. I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life. Do not go here<//text>

I am very angry with the experience at this Sprint. I was looking into different phone companies because my family and I were looking to switch carriers. Initially they were very helpful and attentive to my needs, they gave us the opportunity to test their service. For 14 days we got four iphone Xs and one samsung galaxy s9 plus and two speakers. During the 14 days we visited Mexico and the samsung had no service which you could see how that would be a problem. However the iphone had better service in Mexico than in the US. Strange I know. Upon my return from my trip I decided to follow up with other carriers. As the 14 day trial was coming to an end we decided not to stay with Sprint. I went back TWO DAYS BEFORE the 14 day trial was over but the employee who had originally helped me was not there. The manager then told me I could not return the phones because the original employee was not there and they needed his code to waive the restocking fee. The fact that the MANAGER had no authority to waive the fee was really annoying. They did not let me leave the phones because of liability issued but they said I could leave the speakers, which I found really strange. I was unable to visit the store again until Friday which would make the phones a day over due. I understand that I was late but that was exactly why I came TWO DAYS BEFORE the original turn in day. They did not want to take the phones back so my husband and I left the phones there and we left. As we were exiting they told us they were not responsible for the phones. Then a couple days later i received a phone call saying they have waived the fees. Until a couple days ago, i received another phone call from Sprint saying i owe them 5,000 dollars which is absurd. Another issue is Sprint told me they were not gonna charge me this x amount and they did but did return some of that money to my bank. The issue was the original statement sprint had made of not billing me this amount and they did anyways. I WILL NOT BE PAYING 5,000 DOLLARS FOR PHONES I DO NOT HAVE. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SPRINT AND SPRINT IN GENERAL. They have bad service, hidden fees and terrible costumer service if things don’t go their way.< /review>

They added a line to my account with out my permission. Completely entangled my account with plan adjustments. And told me it's my fault and I had to pay extra money to get it fixed. Just very disappointed since I have been a customer for 11.5 years.</text>

Horrible experience ,  I would give zero stars if I could .   I was quoted wronge fees the whole time , employee could not explain pricing of plans and phone charges clearly and amounts kept changing . I was charged for a transaction then told after my card was ran what was included in the charges and it was not what he originally told me .  Then I asked for a refund and was told he couldn't refund me, his manger was also rude about refunding me.  He then said I would be refunded in 15 days .  It's been a month and still no refund.  I called sprint and they said the store still has not returned the phone I ended up not buying so it showed up I my bill!!! Sprint should fire this whole crew of employees and know they are causing sprint customers to switch phone companies due to such unethical business practices . RUN from this store and sprint .<//text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Recommend this store -Friendly and helpful ! I had a quick upgrade and Tony assisted me in a genuine way. Looking out for my best. I have been with Sprint since 1999  and to many stores. There is always someone walking in with an absurd request and an attitude ( was not of gratitude hahaha)  Watched these guys. They  handled it with grace - responded with kindness . I typically do not yelp- Its a platform for : unreasonable  crazy and entitled. ANY Employee needs to gu by Company guidelines. ... Some young guy was soo rude I almost said something. However he was the kind of guy  ; he would have went off on me.. lol. no reasoning with the unreasonable !!
Great store just make an app . they are helpful and genuine. In the end they are there to sell and make a living..just like everyone else. Educate yourself like when buying anything else be prepared to PAY for what you pick.</Review>< Date>

I walked in here on a Sunday morning at 11:30am to see how much it would be to switch plans from Verizon to Sprint and get an Iphone 7. There were three customer service reps and they all looked like zombies with super bloodshot eyes, and they kept interrupting their own sales pitches to take large gulps of double sized Rockstar energy drinks. Did they all party until dawn last night?  Like I said, it was almost noon. No excuse at that point.

Every question or answer that I gave was immediately interrupted with some farfetched opinion based explanation which I perceived as a pathetic attempt to get me to buy more and get less. Me: "So I've been really frustrated with Verizon lately because..." Sales rep: "...because dey been jackin' up your bills huh?"  Me: "...um, no actually it's because" Sales rep: "...dey been gettin' you bad service huh!?"  Me: "Never mind, it doesn't matter. What I'm really looking for is a..." Sales Rep: "unlimited plan huh?"

I swear I almost flipped out to tell him to stop interrupting me but after 10 minutes I realized that Sprint (apparently) doesn't even offer an option for an unlimited hot-spot. Which I find surprising and possibly doubtful. I will truly never know because you couldn't pay me to interact with these sales reps again. I'm literally writing Sprint off for the next few years based on this experience, but I should know better at this point. Sprint isn't exactly winning awards for customer service.<//text>

<text>I have attended now for over 5 years and absolutely love this place. I enjoy the worship and look forward to hearing the message. It's both encouraging, confirms the areas in which I need to grow in and ultimately a place where I can worship. My children were in high school when we started and I'm so glad that they had a safe place to be and grow as well.

We are so thankful and blessed.</text>< Rating>

My husband and I came to wacc church for a walk as we see people do all the time with our daughter  we come and take walks here because it’s our place of peace and because this is a place where we feel safe and today we came around 11 am this morning and a very rude senior lady who is always there in the mornings with a white truck approached us and said you guys need to leave I told her is this just for today? She said well this is private property so you have to go waving her hands and with her hands shuing us away very rudely she sees us here all the time we come here and never said anything before. So you deny people and turn them away from Christ? When wacc always preaches they bring people to jesus and Jesus to people I felt very bad we left and don’t plan to return Jesus is not in a building he’s in our hearts and god surely sees all of our actions and saw hers thank you for turning people away real way to not act toward anyone</Text>

Okay so I’ve been coming here for a few years now so i don’t know why I’ve never wrote a review. WACC is such a beautiful church filled with beautiful people. It took me a few months to find a church i can call mine until i found WACC. The people really care about us and they always manage to engage and relate to everyone who attends. Everyone is so welcoming so please if you’re looking for a new church, give WACC a chance. I promise you won’t regret it. Thank you WACC for all that you do. See you next Sunday!< /review>

We been coming time and time and every time we come. We always get confronted by a senior lady at the gym  telling us this is a private area and to leave. We been coming three years to walk and now she uses her hand to say get out. Like we couple of flies. All she had to say may you please leave. What make it even worse it a church. I go there to pray at the benches on the back.<//review>

<Review>The Band is too loud for an early Sunday morning. I left with my ears ringing and a headache. I was praying for the music portion to be over. I cant do a rock concert early in the morning like that. Great message, but why does the volume have to be so loud? Is that why people sit outside? Not sure if I will Return.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This is my home Church. This is a Church that goes out into the community and gives back. Follow God and Love People is how we live our lives. If you are looking for a home Church this has everything. A terrific childrens program, The pre-teen and teenage ministries are the best around. Monday night Celebrate Recovery is a place to meet others and heal together. Alpha if you have questions about God, Jesus, Why did it happen to me? Marriage Core to name a few.
And the Sunday Services are 8:00 am, 9:30, 11:00 and 5:00 pm and the small Groups on Sunday
The best of all are the Pastors. They are kind, caring and outstanding examples of Jesus' Love for us..<//review>

I'm a new member and the messages are great. I have 2 preschool aged children and I was super excited that this church offered childcare during weekend services and Monday night support groups. I would love for the childcare workers to be more welcoming and loving and happy. Unfortuantely, we're usually not greeted or acknowledged and they don't come off as friendly people. As a parent you want to feel comfortable with leaving your children in someone elses care and I'm not feeling so impressed right now. Tonight was our 3rd time attending Monday night support groups and I left my children in their care and our group ran late so I picked them up about 5-8 mins late and I apologized and they were not very understanding and told me that pick up time is at 8:25, even tho the groups are scheduled to end at 8:30. I don't know why they never mentioned that before. My kids want to go to play with the other kids but I'm not sure if I want to take them back. Missing our home church in Henderson, NV :'(< /text>

I am new here. The internet it's really bad. From reviews of the residents it's been going on for years. The only option we have it's AT&T DSL and it's super slow. I have 3 kids they need to take classes online because of covid-19 and they keep getting disconnected. They really need to come up with an agreement with AT&T or Spectrum so the residences of Brookside could have better service. Internet access is a necessity not a luxury.</review>

No internet! They dont want to install any utility poles, so youre stuck like its 1920.. they blame the internet services for not wanting to come in the park but ive contacted several and the real reason is because there are no utility poles in this 500 plus home park.. dont move here

On top of it i was harassed by a woman named Teresa and she even had people that live in the park harass me as well, even after i let her know i didnt appreciate it. I have a video to prove it! They act nice when they want you to buy but the minute youre in, they act like theyre making you a favor..</text>

I am new to the place, and not have good experience at all.  First, the place is not recommended for person with disability like me.  There is not enough regular and handicap parking around.  I have problem with my leg, and most of the time force to park far outside the complex, when I don't have any parking spot in the house.  It takes hours of going in circle just to find a parking.  The thing is they kept adding more houses, without the parking issues being resolve first.  Secondly, my car got towed by ASAP towing, when I was rushing and parked in front of the house just to get something inside  and then when I came out I panic when I saw my car being driven off  so I tried to quickly run to chase it, but I can’t really run, so I injured my self in the process when I trip and  fell.  I wanted my car back right away so I had to pay more than $ 300.  The point is I was not even parked outside for more than 5 minutes, because I just wanted to grab something, then leave.  Another issue living here is the water supply is constantly turned off for couple hours.  So far it was an awful and bad experience.</text>

I’ve recently moved in with my family of 6. At first this place seemed like the optimal option in these uncertain times. I’ll keep this succinct and list my grievances in order from worst to less worse.

TL;DR: At the bottom

The internet. To start in the year 2020, the internet isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity especially during an unceasing pandemic. When they first give you the tour of the area they never mention the glaring issue of not have any reliable internet. If you get lucky and buy a plot next to an arbitrary radius and you might be able to get wired internet. If you’re unlucky like my family was you have to choose between two main providers, both of which are via satellite and unbearably awful. Both ISPs (Internet Service Providers) offer 25Mb speeds for two years contracts at rates that are sometimes are up to $120+/month, with low data caps and extremely fickle internet stability. My family was promised speeds of 25Mb, we’re lucky if we get 1Mb because typically we get 30Kb. The reason as to why this area doesn’t have any good ISPs is because the previous owners were in debt to Spectrum and when the current owners bought this plot they decided that the thing on which the global economy relies on wasn’t important . As such they’re forcing you to pay astronomical amounts of money for McDonald’s WiFi.  And even that McDonald’s WiFi is free.

Management is awful. As you’ve probably seen here some reviews state that they’ve promised better internet at the park. Well I’m sure the first man will walk on mars before they get reliable Internet here. When we first started searching for internet we came to dead end with the ISPs none could support a family that requires the internet to go to school and work. When we told this to management their answer was simple. If we wanted to get better internet here we could get signatures from the entire park saying that they would switch ISPs if Spectrum installed wired internet. So that the park wouldn’t have to pay because they’ve having a hard time making money increasing the rent every year. So if you want to live here be prepared to do the work of management without any of the payment.

Broken on arrival. The house came with broken appliances, the microwave, dishwasher and the power supply, can barley power the house. To start when we first came into the house we noticed that the microwave had a huge crack/tear in the center of the backplate, the dishwasher didn’t work and couldn’t even get water flowing into it. The floors are flimsy and tear super easy. I could go into a land fill and find better construction material. Lastly the power supply can barely handle a pc and ac unit before shutting down. If you wanted to have friends over after the pandemic, don’t bother, the power will cut out from more than a few people charging their phones.

No parking spaces. The parking here is by far the worst one I’ve seen in any mobile home park. The spaces can barley accommodate your family let alone any guest. The employee parking takes 1/4th of the entire parking spaces & if you want to park outside, good luck walking a few blocks at night. You would think that this place would’ve figured out a solution by now but I guess they still are waiting for us to resolve it for them.

TL;DR: If you are planning on buying a property here, don’t. It’s clear that a good majority of the park as brought up these issues before and yet nothing has been done to resolve them. With this pandemic every time you go out, you aren’t just risking yourself, you’re risking your friends and your family. By giving people who are already under heavy economic burden, costly and ineffective internet the park has sealed your fate. You needed to make an important conference call? Good luck not being able to connect the meeting. You need to do research for your upcoming final? Have fun with the internet timing out every time you click a link. It’s clear that if they aren’t willing to help even in times of economic hardships and ever growing pandemic, they won’t help period.< /Review>

Deserves 0 stars 👎, rent is too high with no type of rent control! When I say high it is about 1,500 to give an estimate, if not higher for certain residents. Every year they will keep increasing the rent. Avoid it while you can. Also they DON'T allow any other internet provider than AT&T, which is slow & overpriced! Which is extremely inconvenient if you are a university student. Very limited parking space & it will get much worse since they are bringing more houses & not providing more parking spaces. Lastly, they constantly shut off the water every single week which shows how much they value their residents! Funny thing is that they shut off the water because they are bringing in more homes to continue to steal people's hard earned money. As a side note, the management here is mediocre at best. They are unhelpful & not trustworthy at all. Before you go on buying a new house from them make sure they have explained everything in a thorough manner. As I have seen in many other reviews I am not the only one who has noticed all these problems within the Brookside community. That is why I strongly encourage you to look elsewhere no matter how promising management makes it seem.<//review>

<Text>It is very unpleasant to live here. They tow cars out of people’s own houses! Not enough parking anywhere, they are constantly contacting ASAP Towing who CANNOT charge $200-$300 to release your car then and there. Also, THEY HAVE NEVER POSTED A WARNING THAT STATES YOU ARE SUBJECT TO BEING TOWED. “Clearly Posted Warning. A tower must have written consent from the property owner or his agent, who must have waited one hour before calling for the tow. “  ASAP Towing tows cars at 12- 2AM in the morning. Property owner does not call and hour before!
“Also, a sign not less than 17 inches by 22 inches in size should be displayed in plain view at all entrances to the property.” THERE IS NO SIGN WHATSOEVER!
“It should prohibit public parking and indicate that vehicles will be removed at the owner’s expense, and post the telephone number of the local traffic law enforcement agency and the name and telephone number of each towing company that is a party to a written general towing authorization agreement with the property owner. “ Management at Brookside Mobile Homes does not care. We’ve brought them this issue time and time again to their attention and nothing! Reporting it to the HCD of California as well as ASAP Towing to the BBB. They make residents comply to extremely strict rules but they themselves do not care about the well-being of their residents. It’s awfully sad.
Living conditions when moving houses in are also the worst! They are adding homes instead of adding parking for residents. And they simply do not care for the safety of those around them. Sometimes there are children who are playing outside and huge trucks with houses on the streets. It’s very unsatisfying to live here. If I could give it negative stars I would! I HUGHLY do NOT recommend it here. No matter how good the promises look to you SEARCH ELSEWHERE. Clean community but management only cares about appearance and not your safety, satisfaction, or wellbeing!<//Text><Name>L D< /Name><date>1579269217681<//date><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2d72c06546fbb:0xf00b4744b400d028< /Gmap_id><user>114402630117432340605</user>< Response>

If I could I’d give it a zero. Look elsewhere.
1. No parking EVER, because all the guests have extra cars parked there daily and they substitute cars so they don’t lose their parking. More ridiculous is that although the Country Club knows there isn't sufficient parking, they still have the audacity to call tow trucks and have your car towed from In front of your house. Property and vehicle were both damaged.
2. They are ridiculously noisy and listen to false claims, such as someone’s dog attacking an employee when no proof was provided, so dog had to be removed from the premises when everyday there are tons of dogs and cats in the community wondering around.
3. They put the rent up every year so don’t expect to pay any less.
4. The people who manage the community only look to make the place seem like a great community but isn’t when you actually live here.
5. The pools are usually always closed and under maintenance.
6. Repeated warnings of things already done.
7. Neighbors or employees who live in the community always call the tow truck when they clearly know there’s never parking... like how can you not park in front of your own home and they keep certain parking restricted for employees only when there’s nobody there parked after 5/6 (waste of space).
8. So many other things wrong with this community but don’t take it from me find out yourself before actually living here!!!!!!</text>

<review>No parking, no good internet and that’s only because the owners of Brookside Country Club don’t let other internet providers in to the community. Over priced rent.

Living here has been a nightmare. My friend came over to my house but unfortunately there was no parking in the guest parking spaces (THERE IS NEVER EVER PARKING HERE) so parked in front of my house for less than 30 mins and his car got towed away. Also internet sucks!!!! Big time!!!!!
This places needs to listen to the people that are making them rich. And give us better parking spaces and internet</Review>

<Review>To start off with parking is none existing and if you park in front of your house you run the high risk of being towed (which is expensive $250+) the sad part is that Brookside management are the ones that call the tow trucks. Second the internet is slow and when I say slow I mean SLOOOOW, only ATT is allowed into the community and their speeds are 768kbps this is less than 1Gigabits and the monthly is $50 which is not cheap. Brookside Management REFUSES to let other internet providers into the community (I guess they have some type of contract with ATT that only benefits the owners of Brookside) This place needs a lot of improving. All they do is improve the aesthetics such as stop signs, the playground just to lure more people into rent instead of taking care of the people that are already paying the high rent.</Review>< name>

<Text>I'm giving it 2 stars because I like walking on the clean roads and there's barely any traffic or noise, also because I like managment, that means Teresa, I think she's really polite. But I have the same complaints as the others, you can only get dsl internet, there's not enough parking, you're not allowed to park on the roads, which I don't mind, but if you have space other than your carport they should allow you or your visitors to park with out being towed away. Lack of security, there are homeless people, residents, and cats scavenging into the trash. Eventhough trash is collected 3 times a week there are not enough bins and people just throw it on the floor, specially on the weekends.</Text><response>None<//response><userid>100394312977380981869<//userid>< Rate>

Seeing as we are paying a lot in space rent. You would think they would put a gate. The place is quiet for the most part but there are homeless that come in and raid the trash. Outside people dumping in our large bins. They fill them up making a mess of everyone's trash. And the place have no cable or good phone lines going in to the park so everyone has to get bad wireless internet. New owners need to take care of these and more issues.</review>

<review>Staff is super helpful. Truly appreciate Noah & Dave helping me to my car with my RO water. The selection of fresh and saltwater fish is outrageous. All their tanks are pristine & maintained beautifully.<//review>< Pictures>

I came here today to buy a bunch of fish for my 60 gallon and was extremely happy with the customer service. The worker was super nice, and helped me, answering all my questions, and packaging all of my fish. It was my first time at this store, and I was shocked by how amazing the store actually is. There isn't the largest selection, but the store is really well designed and is now my absolute favorite store. The prices are also great and all the staff are really knowledgeable. 10/10 would return!<//review>

They are always willing to give advice / product recommendations. We even had an algae bloom starting once and the owner told us to get a product that he didn't carry (a UV light). Wanted to help vs. just selling us something. This is definitely our favorite shop.<//text></record>

Competitive pricing for RO/DI and Saltwater fillups.  Prices listed on the frag tank aren't updated all the time, but the employees are quick to answer any questions.  Clean tanks.  Decent selection of dry goods also.</text>

Reply to owner: I had my mask on so I believe you’re thinking of someone else. I asked for a credit on the one rummy nose Tetra, not the Cardinal tetras I was warned about. I didn’t see the ‘no refunds’ signs so yeah I believe that absolves you of financial liability in this case, sorry about that

Update: Turns out they don't honor returns on faulty products. Even PetsSmart and Petco have a 2 week return policy.
One of the 30 fish I purchased died in 6 days. The rest are fine. I went back to the store with fish and a sample of my tank water in hand for store credit and was refused by the guy who runs the place; Dave is his name I believe. I'm not gonna pursue it, it's just a $3.50 fish. But it's a bummer a small indie fish shop that relies on local return customers would turn down a reasonable and legally backed request for a refund. I've spent $400 there but will be making future purchases elsewhere.

Really enjoyed my time here and happy with the products I bought.
When purchasing pet fish I like to stick to specialty shops like this one which specialize in fish and fish paraphernalia. Only preferences I have are reasonable prices and that the owner and employees care for the fish and keep them healthy and happy which this shops delivers on. Will be coming back when I'm ready to continue filling out my community tank.</Text>

This review is long overdue.  There is nobody in the business with more knowledge and experience as Dave.  This store delivers great advice, products, livestock, corals, and equipment.  They delivery the absolute highest in customer service and you will agree with me if you allow them to assist you in your aquarium needs.  I highly recommend doing business with Ocean’s Tropical Fish.<//review>

The place looks nice and has great employees and dried goods but almost all of the fresh water tanks either had dead fish or the fish looked ill looks they care a lot more about the salt water fish and neglect the fresh water fish.<//Review>

Fish are healthy, stocks everything you would need and the prices are fair on most things.

My boyfriend and I went back in November of this year after doing a search. The store design and aesthetic is worth the drive but that's the extent of it. Not a lot of interesting stuff that you wouldn't find at Petco. From the pictures on google it seemed like June of 2016 was the best year he had a lot of beautiful animals and the most variety we had seen when we visited. Now if you look at anything from 2019 the tanks look very lifeless, empty and colorless. We mostly just order online since most shops have the same thing all the time.<//text>

The guy who owns this place (or is just always working) is very nice and super knowledgeable. I bought my Betta here because they were kept in real tanks and not cups. It's been almost two months and my Betta's colors have gotten super bright and he's healthy.< /text>

Very helpful sales rep, answered all the questions I had on a heater that overheat from another store.

I’ll be back again, I purchased a heater, temperature strip and an automatic water tester.

Excellent service and quality merchandise.<//Review>

Awesome shop!  The staff is friendly and super helpful. David is extremely knowledgeable and is dedicated to the craft. He will take the time to answer questions and help you find solutions, products, and livestock to suit your needs. They also understand people have budgets. They take a no-nonsense approach, and won't sell you something you don't need, unless of course you ask for it specifically, in which case they will get it for you!  Great shop, highly recommended!<//text>

All the fish here seem very happy. They have clean tanks and crystal clear water. The coral tank they have is amazing.

The growing freshwater fish section is certainly worth coming in to see.

Great prices all around.<//review>

It is very normal for black ghost knifes to just lay under Rocks, plants, etc. We were not too sure what more you wanted from us since we didn’t carry the big fish you were looking for.

<review>They had 1 fish suitable for a large fresh water tank and it didn't look healthy.  The guy behind the counter was way more interested in looking at his phone than trying to help me out and I was the only person in the store.  It's a small store with distracted employees.  That was my experience.< /review>< user>

<time>1549478273769< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Prices matter in retail... But when buying fish or any living thing, a place like Ocean's is invaluable. You'll pay a little more on some fish BUT their stock in my opinion seems healthier, sourced from better fish wholesalers. They even send the fish/snails/shrimp home in double-bagged, light-protected poly bags.
I'm sure they can special order any other fish you might want too.
We bought a Betta and some nerite snails for a small, planted 5 gallon tank my kids love... Everything is still healthy and going strong.
I feel like the small added expense of shopping here is TOTALLY worth it.
Why?
After saving .50¢ per fish, having to return (probably sick when purchased) dead fish to the big name pet stores is sad for my kids. It erodes my confidence as a fish keeper. It is also a waste of my time to travel back to the store(which start with P's, you know who they are) to return the dead fish.
I'm making it a point to stop by Ocean's first when I need something fish related.
Starting with healthy, well-fed, adjusted specimens is the key to success in keeping fish.
BTW their price for frozen bloodworms can't be beat!!!
Support your LFS, go to Ocean's!

Awesome place!

For a newbie marine aquarist this is the place to go. We bought a house that had a tank installed and running already, (just no fish in it) so we had to take it out or learn quick as marine virgins. We decided to give it a go and just stock up with affordable sea life at first, incase we accidentally made a dead fish soup :(

Luckily that hasn't happened and we owe a lot of that success to Oceans! Our experiences have all been super positive, we had lots of questions when we were first starting out, and even if they were way busy sometimes the owner and employees always did a great job of taking care of us and answering questions.
I won't name names, but we tried going to a couple other stores where the employees were either not helpful, not friendly, out right shady, or not knowledgeable and the fish or coral we did get from those places didn't last very long... Even though the things we got at oceans are still alive and well (so it's not a systemic problem, our levels show it's a healthy environment) IMO I feel those other stores just wanted to make a buck off of some newbies and sold us some less than healthy sea life.

Finally, another cool thing is that they remember you here! And when you come back in they seem genuinely interested in the well being of your aquarium. Actually I'm writing this because the owner seemed kinda hurt by and asked me about a 3 star rating my wife left for Oceans by mistake (intended for Sandbar) and I felt so bad I needed to add my own review on top of having my wife correct hers.

Thanks guys, keep up the great work!<//text>

Ok Tropical Fish enthusiast this is your place to buy as the owner David delivers a quality, healthy fish and inventory of your aquarium needs. Very well priced and no pressure what so ever. My  wife and I visited  many times before we bought and so happy we did as our fish are healthy and growing! Go on in and talk with David and look around to see all what a aquatic’s store should look like and run like. There is no comparison to other stores and Ocean’s is the closest to my house so a win win for us.<//Text>

David owns prob the cleanest salt/fresh water store in Orange County.  I've bought fish from Tongs, Seaside, etc but the fish evnetualy die after a couple weeks.  David actually cares about his fish and takes pride in keeping his store immaculate.  He even goes as far as to cleaning all the socks daily. Haha He sells his fish/coral at a competitive price.  Just, remember, you pay for quality.  If you buy a fish @ Oceans Tropical Fish, it will be a fish you will have years.  :-)  Josh< /Text>

<Review>I've been going here some time and David's always been super helpful.  I keep freshwater fish and am not a reefer; in some stores the freshwater stock gets neglected in favor of the saltwater since freshwater fish are generally cheaper and less 'glamorous' than saltwater.  Not so in this case!  They're kept just as well and are very healthy.

Buying neon tetras is always an iffy proposition because they've become so overbred that their hardiness has taken a hit.  Tank-raised or not, a lot of neons tend to be fragile and die right out of the blue.  I've never had a loss from illness with the neons I've bought from this store and I've got a healthy, happy school of them in my 55 now.  David's always happy to talk about where he got his fish from and how long they've been in the store and how they're doing, and it's great information for figuring out how much acclimation they might need when brought home.  I really appreciate the honesty.  This is a sign of someone who cares about the well-being of the fish, not making a quick buck.

I hope he continues expanding his business and branches out more into more species, though not at the expense of their care.  Feel free to give the ferocious guard dog Coda some scratches too.   She appreciates it.  ;)<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< username>

This store is my go to place.. I have been in this hobby for a while and I have never seen such a clean fishstore. The fish husbandry is great and I hardly see any dead fish in the tanks. Few days back i bought some chromes for my 75G from LFS and than some from Ocean's Tropical Fish.. and I could clearly tell the difference of which fish is from which store. The once that came from my LFS has bruises and lost scales and tales while the ones that I brought from this store are fresh, healthy, looking beautiful and shine well due to all scales intact.

You got to see the packaging he does while selling you the fishes. At first he doesn't use the net to catch the fishes. He has a transparent plastic fish catcher which doesn't allow the fishes to be out of water at any point of time. IMO that is more healthier way to catch them. Secondly I have never seen someone packing the fishes with so much care and attention like Dave does. This shows how much he cares his fishes unlike others who just want to sell them. It takes me a while to unpack those bags to put fish in my tank.

Dave also bought my live rock and gave me a very competitive price. I was trying to sell those on craigslist and no one was interested and Dave gave me better price on what I was selling for on craigslist.

Further he gave me whole lot of cheato for $5. I never see any LFS carry cheato for sale. That's why I used to purchase on ebay for much more money and added shipping cost.

This store rocks... way to go Dave.. keep it up.. this hobby is intact as long as we have LFS stores like this. Dave you are doing an awesome job.< /Text>

So glad to find Ocean's again! I used to go to David's store when he was in Aliso and was bummed when it closed. But now his new store is twice the size of the old one and he's got a bigger selection with the same great prices and awesome customer service.< /Text>

This is a great little shop! It's not huge but still has a great selection of both fresh and salt water. Super healthy fish! Even has some pretty nice coral frags. Its not huge but definitely has everything you need and then some. Ive bought easily 100 fish there and have lost 2. 1 pea puffer that didnt make it through the dewormer and a flame Gourami. All my other fish have been 100% from shrimp and tetras to angels.. Staff there is super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The only store Ive ever been to that when I started picking out fish, asked if my tank was cycled... That was my 1st time there and so grateful I found this place. They even engage with my 8 year old daughter who loves going there too and getting her seashell everytime!  If there happens to be something they dont know, they say it.. They dont just give you some bs answer and that I can 100% support! I finally got sick and tired of buying fish from chain stores only to have them die within a week... Definitely worth the 45 minute drive. And dare I say I have even added fish straight to my existing tanks without a quarantine with zero issues... I would NEVER do this with a chain store fish. You guys and gal are AWESOME!!<//Review>

<Review>This was my first time visit at this location and received exceptional service. Israel greeted me at the door and took his time to answer questions and directed me to the product i was looking for. I will certainly start making my automotive purchases at this store from hereon.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>Employees are friendlier than that zone place by far! As well as knowledgeable and very helpful and will get "hands-on" on occasion to assure you of fit or diagnosis.
The prices are better on many items than the other 'boys' and they'll give you a free charge and/or analysis on your car battery.
They also give a $10 store credit if you bring in a core, no purchase required! Being open late until 10:00pm helped me since I work late and have a family.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Above all, a guy who went out to take the battery, it seemed that one was sniffing and did not see any education.
They were santa ana la mac and main.
Have if they eat more chargers and give better service as in the copetencia.

Lleve una bateria a cargar y, resulta que nadamas habia un solo cargador para una bateria y,ya estaba ocupado y que tendria que regresar en 2 horas o mas,se me hizo mal servicio. Sobre todo un cuate que salio para llevarse la bateria,paresia que uno teporocho y no se le veia alguna educacion .
Fuen santa ana la mac y main.
Haber si comoran mas cargadores y dan mejor servicio como en la copetencia.<//Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Nash Asandas< /user_name><time>1506825058615<//time><rating>3< /rating><Text>Hello fellow foodies, I would have provided Leelin a whole 5* yet had to keep it real.

Formerly Goldilocks, this establishment used to put out fine quality food at more than fair prices.  Goldilocks was my all time fav spot for filipino food.

I had a swift change of mind upon my return yesterday. Ordered the palabok and the fried chicken. It looked real good. Presention was excellent, yet found the food under seasoned and quite ordinary tasting.

C'mon guys, what happened? You need to seriously work on improving  the quality of the food you put out

On a lighter note, they kept the place clean and cool. The wait staff was polite, attentive, and greeted us with a smile. Keep that up guys!

Hopefully next time around I
observe a SUBSTANTIAL improvement.

Yes, everybody deserves a second chance! See you guys in a month.

Btw James appeared to make our visit way more entertaining.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFjoRsUf4l2Lt3LL_7AIUIS6-j1mp7e2dOh_h-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtkEW36JPQLfdDk2jBCksPemp5sNHwq11t6yA7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxgbqeQGPAcbZn7uLhKQFHAEFzGCz-yaM8TEfX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIc2bvBKN1sB5EneA-jwCj4HkklDazWIT7NOX2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0eku1kjHBBOsmDFEh6H2G8qSrRLus8rb3vgh-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMveeBGY6vF95JlE-T8qmeeJpH9cu4QUwf224Vq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-tavsgwZT9AwRbJGqngq-NW4NbzbrD0IgV0RU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPa7mNeKXFWF99u7QQUXIqjcw1Ketpn8KoTAae=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn-u3v0STo_49z2XwgRaJLBWk_NMb13lWW6KTg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJseDcxVcuJ6zJjPGF1kb31DkwQvPjnBMxaw9C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1Of_2VmS1rxrxDuPqktO4pcnHXDJJLWM2lB2U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dd2da0274be857:0x8955a54d8f58b943</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Service of the long time waiters are great! Just wish they had a combo plate coupled with a dessert hence 4 stars. Not a lot of selection of pastries too and I do have a sweet tooth.<//text>

Bought a cake, asked for happy birthday to be written on it, where clearly there was room for it, and all they did was write on a piece of plastic and put the plastic on the cake.   Very unprofessional for a bakery!  Will never buy a cake from them again regardless of the taste.<//text>

The best Filipino restaurant to bring your non Filipino friends! Delicious food, friendly service and very clean kitchen and restaurant as a whole. Price is lower and competitive to surrounding eateries.  Their menu is extensive, they offer traditional and new creative items such as longganisa burger and Filipino version of BLT....try it!!!< /text>

1) Clean atmosphere
2) Tasty food, but nothing to make me feel like I want to return more than once a month at most.
3) Though service has always been obnoxiously slow, it is friendly.
5 stars would've been given if they didn't have a policy of not seating parties until everyone shows up.<//text>

The mocha cake I bought is excellent, almost like tiramisu. The tocino I ordered for lunch has a good serving size but the flavor and texture of the cured pork is different (not in a nice way) than the more popular Pampanga style. The servers are "maasikaso".<//text>

It is not the traditional best quality Filipino cooking for me, they need an infusion of better chefs, and find their identity. It is a clean, decent restaurant. I do prefer higher quality Filipino foods, like Azon's, Amboy and even LA Rose Cafe.< /review>

<review>Great Pilipino breakfast buffet! Lots of choices from your typical pan de sal to your fried garlic rice. Very friendly and prompt staff. Must do is champorado with or without tuyo or dilis (dried salty fish).  They also provide dessert from their cake case ( mango, ube, etc). Although the staff serve your plate, you can always ask for more or little. They serve barako coffee. Highly recommended specially for large group. Bakery inside for pasalubong!<//review>< pictures>

<text>Had chicken adovo.. The worst chicken adovo in my entire life! The chicken had huge bones and big pieces of skin, extremely greasy, the sauce was tasteless. It looks like it was old.
What a shame!

On my recent visit to this place with my boyfriend, I ordered their single serving of Sisig na Bangus and it comes with a choice of either white rice or garlic rice—I chose the latter, of course— and vegetable for the day! My boyfriend ordered their single serving of Crispy Dinuguan and Chicken Adobo. The serving of the food was fast, maybe because it was already after lunch when we went here. The server was friendly and the best! He kept checking on us every time and made sure that we never run out of water, etc. The lady owner also checked on us to make sure that everything was fine.

Boyfriend said that his food was good! As for my Sisig na Bangus, it was perfect! I was crying happily inside every time I take a spoonful of it! With every bite, I kept on saying to my boyfriend how delicious it was! Hahaha! I even told him that I could eat this food every day and would never get tired of it! Lol. I can’t wait to go back to this place again just to order their Sisig na Bangus! Haha! I hope they would never stop serving this dish and would never change their recipe for it! It’s already perfect just the way it is!< /Text>< user_id>

<Review>We live in Chicago and bought a Leelin Bakery & Cafe Assorted Kakanin that's supposed to be an authentic assortment of native slice cakes. It was sold in a Filipino food store .  It said it was supposed to ube, biko, cassava, and sapin sapin.  Well, none of it was real!  Everything was fake!  It was just made of flour and food coloring.  Buyer beware!  This was a waste of money!  The whole cake was crumbly, dry and tasteless!  It was just one consistency, we couldn't tell which cake was which!  The ingredients listed was wholly false!  We ended up tossing it in the garbage!  Very embarrassing for our guests and your supposed reputable establishment! Retail stores beware, too!< /Review><date>1499565283136</date>< user>

<rate>4< /rate><review>Leelin's, nothing more than Leelin's
Trying to forget my Leelin's of love.

Baboy (Pig) Bonanza!

Leelin Bakery & Cafe, formerly Goldilock's Bakeshop, with the same owners and a makeover (the kind you get when you break up with someone and you're looking to make them jealous with envy when they see you in the arms of someone else) .  Leelin's provides Filipino comfort foods for those unconcerned with such paltry things like high blood pressure & diabetes ;p

Came in for dinner & made sure to take advantage of the 10% off with Yelp check-in.  The restaurant space is now in an open layout compared to it's former iteration.

Tonight's dinner choices (*Warning*-vegans look away)-
Crispy dinuguan
A hearty pork blood stew with crispy pork skin delightfully adorned on top.  I've never had "crispy" dinuguan and my imagination was running wild with what the dish would look like.  But, I was pleasantly surpised with what I saw.  The stew was rich, with choice cuts from all over the pig.  I prefer the pieces of snout, being cartilaginous and uber fatty.  The crunchy pork skin was the pleasurable highlight for me.

Sizzlin sisig
Piping hot from the kitchen, sisig is a popular Filipino dish of diced pork with red onions, chilis, bell peppers and other select ingredients, topped with an incredible, edible sunnyside up egg.  Eggs, like bacon, make everything better!  This selection was hot, spicy, fatty & fun!  I'll always be partial for the sisig at Ellen's Pinoy Grille.  It may not be "authentic", but I love the delectable crunch.  However, the sisig at Leelin's is good and will be a crowd pleasure for all you lovers of pig.

Leelin is also offering  some innovative dishes, such as the longanisa burger-
Longanisa is a Filipino sweet sausage.  I took a pic of the display burger for now, but I plan to try it when I come back.

Of course, the bread & butter (literally & figuratively) of Leelin's Bakery & Cafe are the assortment of baked goods.

Service was good.  There were a lot of staff at the ready to service the needs of diners.  Seating is ample with booths and tables for small & large parties.  Parking is in a private lot shared by Island Pacific Supermarket and Hometown Buffet.

I think, even w/o the vaunted Goldilock's name, Leelin Bakery & Cafe offers quality Filipino food that we grew up loving.  I applaud Leelin for experimenting with new food creations such as the aforementioned longanisa burger.  If you're looking for some bread, sweets and a hearty meal, then I highly recommend checking out Leelin Bakery & Cafe.

On the weekends they have a breakfast buffet but on Sundays it's Uber packed. The buffet is OK nothing really special but if your hungry and you're craving a large filipino breakfast for cheap this is the place to go.</review>

<review>From our initial consultation through installation, Rowland Air offered us first class service. Everyone we dealt with was kind, knowledgeable, and competent. Our new top of the line AC system is whisper quiet and extremely efficient. Like other businesses during this pandemic, they have had to wait for equipment. I can assure you that we’re glad we waited.< /review><user>107002980115415055314<//user>< name>

Jessie is an excellent representative of your company. Extremely professional, and knowledgeable technician. I highly recommend him and Rowland Air for your a/c and heating needs. They’re good enough for Costco, and that says it all, but that’s not all there is.</review>

Rowland Air Conditioning did an amazing job getting us a brand new system! Eric Haymann came out, seen that our unit was done. He worked hard and got a very professional crew together the very next day! We are grateful for everyone that worked very professionally to make sure everything ran well. And we are comfortable in this Heat wave! I highly recommend this company!!< /review>

<review>** EDIT   --
After seeing my previous review I did receive a call saying they would refund the service fee. Fantastic! Glad to know they take their reviews to heart and listen to the feedback. Theyve got my business!

I’ve used Rowland many times in the past and been happy so when our AC went out I called them right away. Made the appointment over the phone on a Saturday afternoon and was told the soonest they could get out would be Thursday. Repair man comes and gives an estimate which included a service fee. I asked about it and the technician explained it was unwaiverable. I questioned why I wasn’t told when I made the appointment; he claimed I should have been. I would never have gone w this company had I known this. It’s always been a fee that is absorbed once the work is agreed upon. Poor business practice.< /review></record></dataset><record>

If you want a new system, or a repair on your old system, Roland does it all, and they do it very well. They are very professional, with specialists who handle design, parts ordering, scheduling, financing, and installation. They aren’t the cheapest around, but we appreciated that there is a whole team involved, along with a physical location, and they know what they are doing.

We purchased a new 5 ton Lennox dual zoned unit last fall that we have been very happy with. We later had them install a high quality air scrubber to add to the dust/virus filtration system present in the Lennox unit. They also upgraded all our ducting for energy conservation and efficiency, and they did a fantastic job. Unfortunately we had a power surge this month that seriously damaged the 9 month old unit. Unbelievably, surge protectors don’t automatically come with HVAC systems. Do yourself a favor and pay a few hundred dollars extra for HVAC surge protectors! We were lucky that we were still under warranty or we would have been out MAJOR money.

We’ve had quite a few employees here, and we have been happy with all of them. They all wore masks and booties and cleaned up after themselves.

My only complaint about Roland is the wait time. This happens with popular businesses, but I feel the waits were excessive- especially for an established customer. It took 3 trips total to repair our unit, which I expected due to parts, but lengthy waits after parts have arrived is excessive, in my opinion, once a repair has been started.

The surge damaged our unit on July 1, and the repair was completed on July 16, but the original completion date was July 20- which would have been 6 days after they received the last part. Almost all of those days were triple digit temps, which led to me becoming ill when the outside temp reached 116°, so they amended the completion date to 2 days after receiving the last part, which was a more reasonable time frame. We purchased a very expensive unit from Roland and also purchased a service contract. We expected much better response times.

Despite my issue with response times, I still recommend this business. Their skill and knowledge is apparent, and I have experienced far too many HVAC technicians who did not have those skills.</text>

Rowland installed new heating and air con systems in both my home and rental unit in the past few years. Excellent service both places.

Today June 21,2021 serviceman Eric Heymann installed an air scrubber to my home system to filter the air after having had awful air during extended fires and generally bad air quality in the valley. I  recommend Rowland highly and have referred them to several friends who have been equally impressed and satisfied with this company. So nice to have a terrific company that still values professionalism and great customer service.< /Text>

Horrible reliably. Numerous service appointments made and confirmed by THEM and "always saying it was supposed to be tomorrow" and never showing up. 4 times! No more!

Update, so someone did just show up. That's great, they do try and got it done. So as long as ending is OK, I'm ok. Much thanks for the effort! Change back to a5 which is what they are! My apologies🙏< /review>

Robert at Rowland Air took very good care of us during our estimate process, explaining a lot.  Santa Clarita is about 10 degrees difference than Los Angeles, and there are many good, reputable air & heating companies in the area, but we had a good feeling with Robert’s step-by-step explanations of products and warranties, our location, and the ability for our existing ductwork to work with the new system.  One-Day install of ac unit and furnace-coil.  We are very satisfied with the outcome.<//Text>

Very Very Happy with this company.  After the heater went out they responded swiftly and gave us an estimate with no hidden nonsense.  In Fact, we were informed the licensed Lennox business who installed the air conditioner a few years ago never pulled the permits and cut all kinds of corners.  They corrected all the issues and we are toasty warm.
Very Very Grateful for the company and Brett’s professionalism.<//text>

Gabe from Rowland Air arrived between the expected service appointment time and got right to work. Gabe was thorough in explaining what he would during the AC service inspection and described the condition of the unit upon completion of the maintenance check. I appreciated Gabe’s demeanor and professional attitude.</review>

Replaced existing A/C-Furnace with a new unit... Added return air register...  They know their business... This is the 3rd install/upgrade in the last 30 years by Roland Air...They get the job done, on time and clean, neat and no extra charges... Yep, I'd recommend them to friends.</review>

Excellent service by Gabriel. He took the time to explain the maintenance process. Even tightened up some of the outside screws to make everything run quieter. I will definitely pick up a maintenance contract come next fall with this company. They installed my original Lennox system and I will use them for future maintenance and repair.<//text>

They arrived after my scheduled 3 hour block and then when choosing an emailed receipt for services, got their covid policy instead?

Rowland is amazing to work with, my team included Israel, Curtis, Derrick, Alano (there are a couple of names I don’t remember).  They were professional, polite, friendly and very easy to work with.  The quality of their work and their attention to detail was excellent.  I would immediately choose Rowland for any other HVAC work in the future!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Technician was extremely polite and showed up when he said he would. He was very safety conscious about covid and offered to put booties on. He was very thorough and the young lady that called me was very polite and professional. This is why they installed by air conditioning and will be the only one fit service it as long as we have it</Review>< pics>

I'm not exactly sure how I came across these guys but I am glad I did. They designed my HVAC system and have been maintaining it since. Couldn't be happier with the service and professionalism of these guys. If there was one negative it would be that their techs tend yo try to upsell and you don't want that from them. Let the office try to bring in more business. Aside from that, their service is great and their prices are reasonable.< /review>

Replaced thermostat, filter and recharged our unit in a very efficient

I signed up for the yearly maintenance ,that's how confident
I feel about this company.

Dear Mr. Rowland,

I am customer of your company since March 2019, when I had my AC system, furnace, and ducting done. I went through Lowe's and spent over $11,000 for overhauling the whole system. Your guys did a great job and we were very pleased with the install.

However, 1 year and 5 months later, my AC system goes out and here's where things have just gone downhill. A technician from Rowland Air came out and did a leak test and found the coil in the attic had been leaking. I was informed the part was under warranty but the labor had expired after 1 year. The cost to replace the coil would be $1600. Not only that, the cost to have done the leak inspection was $323. I paid the $323 and requested the part to be reordered under warranty.

From that point, I contacted Lowe's and all they managed to do was contact Rowland Air and have the $323 I already paid deducted from the $1600. I think this is standard business practice whether it's a car repair or home repair to absorb the cost of the initial inspection as part of the labor cost for repair/replacement, so it really didn't seem like they did anything. Lowe's then advised me to contact Lennox, who was the manufacturer of this AC system, to see what they could do to help with the labor costs.

I went ahead and contacted Lennox waiting on hold for over an hour and finally when I spoke to someone, I was told the part was made by a sister company, ADP, and was directed to call them. I called ADP and left a voicemail and heard back a few days later saying they could not do anything for labor. I reached out to Lowe's again and have basically been told there is nothing more they can do.

I called Rowland Air's office this past Saturday and vented my frustration with this lack of customer service. I felt that I shouldn't be the one having to call around everywhere and it should be Rowland Air that provides customer service to me as their customer. I was told no one from management was available and she'd take a message and get back to me. Today is Wednesday night and I have yet to receive any callback from your office.

At this point, I have the coil replacement scheduled for 9/10 with Rowland Air. As much as I hate to do this and leave a bad review (which I rarely do), there seems to be no other way to get any help in customer service from Rowland Air. How can a company with contracts from Costco and Lowe's treat their customer this way? I've spent over $11,000 just 1 year and 5 months ago and I'm left to pay this $1600 out of my own pocket? That's not what customer service is about. The reason I went with Lowe's and Rowland Air was because I thought if I ran into a situation like this, there would be excellent customer service willing and ready to take care of me. Instead, I'm left disappointed by your company's lack of service.

It's unfortunate it has come to this, but you've essentially lost me as a customer. Once I get the coil replacement done and pay another $1300 on top of the $300 I've already paid, I'll be taking my business elsewhere and will have to recommend others (family, friends, and neighbors) to do the same, because I would not anyone else to run into the same situation I'm in after paying so much money to a company to install and overhaul the whole system and be asked to pay the labor for part that broke just 1 year and 5 months (probably earlier since it was a leak).

I don't know if I will even get a reply, but as I've said, I feel like I have no other options left.</text>

<Review>Roland's team did an excellent job on the installation of my new central air and heating. They were well organized, clean, efficient,  respectful and thoughtful. I expected a lot of noise and chaos but I hardly knew they were here. My new unit is operating perfectly.  I would highly recommend them.<//Review>< Pics>

Rowland Air did an amazing job on our HVAC system, from start to finish.  Ron did a thorough assessment and helped me understand in layman’s terms the nuances of how the heat/cool system works.  This tutorial is much appreciated for the customer to know what is being done and what’s best for the household needs.  He provided full explanation of the options and discounts.

Our old system was older than 40 yrs and with old ducts, installation was planned for 2 days. The installation crew so efficient and completed the job in 1 day!! Kudos to Edward, Derek, Matt, Nick, Alano, and Curtis!!  They were timely, explained all changes, polite, and cleaned up afterwards.  I was very impressed by Edward and his team’s professionalism.  We love our new HVAC. The process was smooth and I highly recommend them!!!<//Text>

Giovanni was personable and professional.  He quickly diagnosed that we were low on coolant, likely due to a leak, and added more to our system.  We have an old A/C system, so I was pleased that he wasn’t a salesman just trying to sell us a new unit!<//review>

I called Rowland Air Inc to have a look as to what the problem might be. The company that installed the thermostat broke it upon installing it, and said nothing. Eric from Rowland’s was professional and knowledgeable. Once I explained the situation he went right to the thermostat and replaced the backplate that was broken. The problem was fixed in a very short time. Warm air ahhh! Thank you Eric and Rowland air Inc<//Text><Date>1606867123794</Date>< Pics>

I was able to get a next day appointment.  The tech, called 30 minutes before he arrived , was on time, explained why we were having the problem, and what it would cost to repair.   He then answered all our questions, helped us register with total connect comfort, and showed us how to use the app.  We appreciate how quickly we were able to get an appointment and how well the job was done.< /review>

My home’s AC unit died over a holiday weekend and they were able to quickly assess the situation and work to have a new unit installed immediately.

First of all, they charged me twice for the service. Not sure if it was an error or deliberate thinking they might get away with it. I reached out to the manager to reverse the duplicate charge but to no avail after calling twice. Secondly, labor is charged for every part they replace which is unheard of. The part is worth $30 which we ordered but did not come on time for the appointment but I was billed a ridiculous amount. Not doing business with this company ever again. ***customer beware***< /Review>

Everyone at Rowland was a pleasure to deal with.  Smart, kind and on time.  They installed the right system for our home and took the stress out of the situation.  No corners were cut and they exceeded our expectations on every level, especially price.  I’ve never felt the need to leave a review before but they deserve it.</text>

Purchased A/C unit from Rowland Air 6 yrs ago.
Never a single problem with unit and installation was flawless.
Use them yearly for routine maintenance. Never anything wrong.
Business is responsive and very quick to respond, no waiting months to get a service professional out.< /review>

<Review>Very pleasant tech.  Took the time to explain to me what he was doing and answered my questions clearly so the answers were easily understood.  Kelly kept me aware of the arrival time as they were very busy and running a little behind. I gave them an on time because they kept me updated through texts and I could run errands if needed. I signed up for maintenance service.< /Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>12_19-20 I had a service call today for a little vent in ductwork and they showed up exactly on time and Gabriel did an excellent job. I'm going to have some future work coming up and Rowland air will get it.

So they called me up for a service call and I said why not.where I thought they were going to do a service check on both my heating and air conditioning units, it turned out that the special was only for one, the heater. I had him do both and paid the extra money. Rick was we real good and updated my systems and told me what I was going to need to get done and showed me why and it was a worthwhile education. I like the fact that he was honest, which exemplifies the entire company. I was very happy with the results. And it appears in a couple months he will have to come back and update part of my heating unit and keep me healthy. I recommend them.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have had a Great Experience with Rowland when, purchasing both Heating & Air Conditioning units.  It continued with the installation, and today, with a service call by Technician Rick Caron.  As I am a senior (81), I especially appreciate Rick's patience in explaining his "expertise" and knowledge so that I may better understand the process of the  problem.  Rick called me twice to let me know when he was on his way, so I knew when I could expect him.  I applaud him, and also, for the "Great Customer Service" from the entire Rowland staff!<//text>

I was very pleased with my service. I called yesterday and they told me I was going to be placed on a waitlist probably until September. This morning they called me and said someone canceled and they could be here before 10am. It is a little bit passed ten and they are done.<//review>

This company is the best!
From beginning to end, the professionalism and knowledge shown during the installation and to today’s maintenance is outstanding.
These folks care about what they are doing.
So happy I stopped at the Costco display.
I still stop and tell the reps and any potential customer just how pleased I am with Rowland Air and the product.

It wasn't a simple replacement; we needed some expert engineering that required additional ductwork and additional vents.  Kelly was always friendly and efficient on the phone, calling us with reminders and handling scheduling.  Cesar came out and did a complete walk-through and made sure we had a complete understanding of what our home needed to upgrade our system and save us money.  When installation day arrived, Edward, Nick, Rafa, Izzy, and Marcos showed up with three trucks.  Each member of the team was professional, polite, and they worked very well together.  They worked happily, singing and playing music that was uplifting to all of us.  They were friendly and involved us in each step.  They took care to be clean and showed that they cared about the job they did. The installation was quick, efficient, and top quality.  They took time to show us how to use our new equipment and made sure we were comfortable with using it before leaving.  We would not hesitate to recommend Rowland Air to anyone!<//Review>< Resp>

I had an early morning AC service call appt which I missed because I didn’t hear the doorbell when the Tech arrived. I called the office and they moved mountains to reschedule me for later in the day. When the Tech, Jesus M. arrived, he was well covered up, head to toe, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines. He inspected and correctly diagnosed the problem, serviced my AC and made recommendations re draining the pipe lines. I couldn’t be happier with the excellent & professional service from Rowland Air, at par with my past experiences. BTW, Rowland Air installed my new AC system 3 years ago and they always provide excellent service to me.< /text>

<Review>I’m very pleased to share my review and personal experience with Rowland Air.   I was searching for a new HVAC/Furnace for my single family home in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.

My extensive research of many local heating and air companies in my area, eventually led me to COSTCO.

I filled out an online form, and shortly thereafter, was contacted by Rowland Air.   They scheduled an in home appointment that was convenient for me, and as we’re in the middle of a global pandemic and local “social distancing” order, the Sales Rep contacted me in advance of his arrival and informed me of their enhanced safety procedures.   He arrived on time, wearing a protective mask, gloves, and protective shoe covering.

He fully explained all of the available options and products, and I selected a furnace a/c combo unit.   As an additional service, Rowland also replaced and installed new smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout my home, after noticing that my current ones did not adhere to recently updated local safety codes.

They also explained and identified several rebates that were available, through my local utility, as well as certain state and federal tax credits.   On top of that, I also received a significant discount and incentive from COSTCO.

We then scheduled the installation.    The process from initial contact to this point, for me, was about 2 weeks.

My installation date was scheduled for 06-04-2020.    My installation team (Curtis, Jeff, Thomas & Alano) arrived at 8:15am.   (15 minutes before the scheduled time of 8:30)

They proceeded to explain every detail of how the day would go.    They showed me all the inventory items, and went through each step.   These install guys were AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC!    Ultra professional, all had masks and every protective item, just as the sales rep had)

They respected my home, and all it’s contents.    They removed all the old equipment, went up in the attic, checked all the ducts, drop cloths everywhere.   I was surprised pleasantly that trough out the entire  day, they had great communication with me.   I asked a LOT of questions!    Some questions I asked twice....and all 4 guys on my install team were incredibly patient and respectful.

The installation was completed by about 4:30pm that day, with a lunch break in between.

The last step was a very thorough recap and briefing of everything they did.    I was provided all the documentation, precise locations, and even details on how to operate my new equipment.    I was particularly impressed that this entire installation team worked VERY well together, and with me throughout the entire day.

As an ultra meticulous business management professional, and small business owner, I have a tendency to have very high expectations when I am in the role of the client.    These 4 guys....throughout this day....not only met my high expectations, but EXCEEDED them!

Note to Rowland Air management.....
I’d love for you to share this review and give a HUGE pat on the back...to,
CURTIS
JEFF
THOMAS
ALANO

THESE 4 guys are the ones who solidified a lifelong relationship with THIS particular client.
I have no doubt that all of your employees are at this same high quality standard of professionalism.... but this is a case, in my humble opinion, where I think it’s the right time to tell you, and other prospective clients, about these specific employees.    I strongly feel they deserve a little extra recognition for a job VERY WELL DONE!

So....don’t be surprised if future clients say to you.....  we want Curtis,  Jeff, Thomas, and Alano to do our install!

I also hope this review will be helpful to others.   There’s a LOT of choices that people have, and this is a very major item for every homeowner.    And it’s generally an item that most homeowners will only do once.

In this case, I’m very happy and pleased that I chose COSTCO, and Rowland Air, and will certainly ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECOMMEND both companies to my colleagues, clients, and friends.</Review><name>Brian Darling</name>< Pictures>

Very happy with the service and installation of my new air conditioner by Rowland Air. Brett, the Sales Rep explained what was needed and set me up with an installation date. Brett went out of his way to make sure that the installation date worked with my day off. The installation was fast and the guys were very professional. I would highly recommend purchasing the unit from Costco who uses Rowland Air. So happy to have a cool house with new technology efficiency.<//Review>

<Review>Estimator was very knowledgeable and thorough. Also, he was polite, considerate of removing his shoes to protect my floors and very nice. It’s too expensive for me at the moment so I kept one star behind, but that is no reflection of the gentleman that came to quote for me.<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>Rowland Air conditioning & Heating exceeded my high expectations from beginning to end. They replaced  my old system in less than 2 days.  The crews were always punctual, courteous, and kept the house clean as they worked. I felt that they were very knowledgeable about their work.  I give the entire Rowland team my highest recommendation.</Review>< pics>

<review>Rowland Air is an amazing Company to do business with.  5:30 pm Friday night I find out that my 96 year old mom was cold and that her furnace had stop working.  I started calling heating companies, but all were closed.  I opened up Rowland Air’s website and saw that they were open 24 hours.  A text box opened and asked if I needed help. I text that I needed a technician to come on Saturday to service the furnace for my mom.  I was able to schedule an appointment on Saturday all by texting.  Saturday morning, earlier than expected Jesse showed up.  The problem wasn’t obvious, so Jesse spent time tracing down the components to determine what was causing the problem.  He was able to find the problem and correct it.  We are so thankful he took the time to check everything and found the problem.  He explained everything to me over the phone what he did and what he found.  Jesse was very nice, polite and a good technician. Their rates are reasonable. I will not hesitate to use Rowland Air again and share with my friends what a great Company to do business with.<//review>< pics>

The other day, initially called to upgrade my WIFI thermostat. Was told no appointments available until September.  Told her to disregard. She called me today and said appointment was available in 30 minutes. She claimed tech had new thermostats with him to install and set up in my WFI. I agreed to the visit. He arrived within minutes and glanced at my thermostat and furnace. And said he could come back next week and install a new thermostat and I would need someone else to set it up to my WIFI.  He then charged me $65 for a Service Call and would charge me another $25 to install the thermostat next week. I paid him the $65 and turned down the return visit.

I wanted to update my original response.  They contacted me regarding my previous review and arranged for an immediate follow up visit.  They arrived on time, and within minutes installed my newly purchased thermostat from a different vendor, set it up to my WIFI, and after reviewing my my furnace / AC system came up with several energy saving recommendations in which we quickly noticed an increase in the efficiency of our system.  Additionally, they discounted the second service visit half of what I paid for the initial service call.  Overall, I was so pleased with their service that I gladly signed up for their yearly service contract.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This was my first time using Rowland to address an air conditioning problem.  Rowland came with several highly recommended referrals, of which, I can honestly say was a great decision to contact them for my repair.

Eric, the technician, was extremely professional and skilled in resolving the issue upon his immediate inspection.  He was upfront about what work needed to be done and the associated cost.  Needless to say, I approved all work needing to be done to correct the problem with my AC.  I couldn’t be more pleased with the service Eric provided and will definitely use Rowland on any future AC issues.

Thank you Eric and thank you ROWLAND!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Date>1577546300733<//Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Extremely unprofessional: My friend recommended COSTCO after they did his AC. We went to COSTCO for my AC and they sent Rowland Air. Robert came out to give a quote which was high. We started discussing which things to change to reduce the price. I told him what my friend paid for his unit which was the same as the unit I need. Robert said he would go back to look up my friend' job since they worked on it too through COSTCO and see how he could match it and get back to me. One week passed and no quote or contact. I called Rowland and the young lady there said she would let Robert know I'm looking for the quote. ANOTHER week passes and no contact - I call again asking for the quote and same story, she'll let Robert know. ANOTHER week passes and no contact so I call to speak to a manager to let them know I'm reporting them to COSTCO for failure to give me a quote and going on Yelp so people can know what to expect from Robert and Rowland.The manager was apologetic and asked for a chance - I finally get the quote from Robert with no apology and the quote is the same original HIGH quote I was given in the first place verbally without the discounts we discussed and without him checking my buddy's quote. It's clear he developed something personal against me- that's not how you handle business and I'll be reporting this to COSTCO consumer affairs. If COSTCO sends ROWLAND to you, now you know what service you can expect.< /text>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1577681117187, 'text': 'Our Design Specialist, Robert met with Douglas ("DM") to prepare an estimate for Douglas\' mother\'s home.  Robert spent several hours doing a thorough analysis of the property and reviewed many different options with Douglas.  Douglas briefly showed Robert two separate estimates he received via email from other HVAC contractors and discussed the difference in price with him.  Robert explained that the contractors were proposing to install completely different equipment and their job scope was not the same. Robert explained the legal requirements of pulling a permit, the value and importance of performing a heat load calculation, properly sizing and designing the ducting system to ensure the proper heating and cooling of the home as well as the peace of mind of having high quality equipment such as Lennox and to be backed by the Costco brand.  Douglas mentioned he was referred by a friend whom had gotten the same equipment at a much lower cost through our company.  Upon further review, we discovered Douglas\' friend did in fact have a system installed by us however the equipment was not the same.  His friend lives in a condominium and Douglas\' mother lives in a single family residence which requires different equipment and a completely different scope of work.  Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges.  Robert reached out to Douglas on several occasions to request he send the proposals to us from the other contractors that he received to review with our management team to try to price match apples to apples however we received no response due to his voicemail being full.'}< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>Jesse was very conscientious. He explained every aspect of the investigation and the fix to my heater and let me watch the entire process. He also educated me about the difference in the effectiveness of various filters available for my unit and informed me about the Rowland’s annual maintenance plans and how they tie in with my manufacturer’s warranty, and he also informed me of LADWP’s free A/C Optimization Program. He took his time and checked my system 7-10x to make sure he located the problem and fixed it completely. He was very patient with my questions, and I had many. I was really pleasantly surprised with Rowland and would definitely use them again.</review>< username>

<text>We just had our Air Conditioning / Heating installed by Rowland (Costco).  Great company and great customer service.  Eric came to our house and explained and went over everything.  He sent out his crew the following week (Edward, Ed, Miguel and a couple of others).  They made sure to cover anything near where they worked, and cleaned up after they were done.  Very professional, and answered all questions we had on the equipment and the new thermostat.  What we loved most was that Eric checked everything and was honest about if something needed to be replaced.  Our ventilation ducts were in great shape, so he told us there was no need to replace them.  What a difference between the old unit we had compared to this new unit.  The air flow is awesome,  and much quieter!!  Couldn't of asked for anything better.  I would recommend Rowland to anyone who is looking into getting a new unit.  The process was fast and easy, and Eric and his crew were the best!!!  Five stars all the way!</text>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Eric was very professional, I had just bought a manufactured home and the central air did not work. It was a very old unit (over 20 years old) with a rusted motor, and I figured it would need to be completely replaced. Eric spent about 2 hours testing and identifying the faulty parts on the unit. He brought the a/c back to life for 1/10 the cost of a replacement, and the a/c now works great. In my experience most vendors would push a replacement. It is nice to know that there are professionals that take pride in their work and can actually fix things. Thank you Eric and Roland Air</text>< pictures>

Rowland stepped up their game  , or some of you Yelper’s don’t know how to rate.
From beginning to end  our experience was great.
Brett started us off , Scott took measurements.
Julio and Juan  installed a complete system including  all new ducts in the attic. All done in 2 days as agreed.  We did the Costco program.
Also all of the extra employees who came by to help were  very friendly, they said thank you and good bye.
My wife was amazed  by their friendliness.
We highly recommend Rowland.</text>< pics>

Office staff was very professional when i called to make an appointment.  Several date/time reminders were sent so as not to forget.  Christopher arrived early in the promised window and was very thorough and professional in his approach.  He assessed need, explained alternatives in detail allowing an informed decision.

In all, a very good experience. Would recommend Rowland and Christopher

The unit was installed yesterday.  The installers ( Lucas, Brian and Curtis ) arrived early in the promised window, reviewed all of the equipment and explained the installation sequence.  Tarps were laid down to keep the pathway clean.  Installation was performed quickly and all areas were cleaned up at completion.  Everything installed was reviewed and explained.

In all, this transaction was handled very professionally.  Would certainly recommend Rowland highly based on all aspects of the transaction.</Text>

Giraldo was very thorough and helpful today, February 20, 2020.  This is his second visit with us and each was a pleasant experience!

Eric was very knowledgeable and informative and explained the system to me in a manner I could understand.  He found an unsealed duct that will need to be fixed and alerted me to a possible missing component.

The whole experience from the initial call for help to the appointment was great!<//Text>

<Review>When my family decided to update and expand our current air conditioning and heating system it was difficult to choose who to trust.  Rowland Air quickly rose to the top of our list.  The representative Chris was educated, respectful, kind and helpful.  Since the installation,  my large family have been amazed at the difference in our comfort level.  Our home was always a peaceful place but now it is peaceful and comfortable.  Even better our electric bill did not sky rocket!  Thank you Rowland Air for your relationship based business and caring attitude...< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Had an issue with my HVAC called Rowland Air to see if they could help. They Sent Eric out within an hour on a Saturday morning who was extremely nice and more importantly extremely knowledgeable. I explained what the problem was and Eric didn’t rush, took his time and figured out what it was. Excellent service. Highly recommended.

<Review>Rowland installed my new Lennox air conditioning & heating unit under a Costco program on 5/21/2019. The technicians were professional, attentive, patient and through. They did a clean job at our home and we are very happy about their work. The new system is running like a charm. Nice job. Thanks.</Review>< gmapID>

I bought a new HVAC and iComfort sys. The installers Jeff, Curtis & Alandro were scheduled to arrive at 0900 and they arrived early 0800 to get set up. They were very professional and followed the CDC guide lines. Jeff explained the plan on the installation. The crew kept their work area clean. The crew used drop cloth and plastic so nothing would make a mess.All three had good personality and seem to like to work for Rowland. My wife and I were very impressed with the good quality workmanship. I would highly recommend this company.<//text>

They went above and beyond to make sure all of my questions were answered and work completed.  Now we can enjoy this hot summer knowing our new unit was installed without a hitch.

Rowland Air installed our new HVAC in our home seven years  ago and has maintained it ever since. They are very knowledgeable and professional. We highly recommend them for any heating and A/C needs you might have.

June 2021- Just had our spring maintenance  in advance of the summer heat. The technician was very thorough and knowledgeable. Things are back in tip-top shape! We really rely on Rowland Air and their team to keep us warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Great job guys!<//Text>

I  have the annual maintenance service and the company is so good about calling me to say it's time for a seasonal check up. The phone staff are so friendly and helpful and making an appointment is a breeze. I had a window of 0930-1230 but got a call at 8:45 from the tech, Gerardo, to see if he could come early. YEAH! He donned his booties and went to work - checking out the furnace and then doing a quick check of the AC. He was polite and efficient. Love this company.< /Text>

Thomas did a great job! He was polite and asked good questions to learn more about the problem. He figured out what was wrong quickly and gave me a cost estimate. He replaced one part (pilot light) and cleaned another (flame sensor) and tested the furnace three times to make sure it would work.
Thomas was excellent! Thanks, Jim McLaughlin<//text>

<review>Thomas H. was great.  He was friendly and professional. He explained the issue clearly and fixed our heater right away.   He recommended and explained various maintenance options in a way that didn't feel pressuring but sounded like a good idea; we didn't have time today but will probably call them back and get a maintenance contract. I wish more repair men were like him.  When we call back I'll ask for him personally, but if he isn't available this visit made us like the company in general enough to trust whoever else they send out.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>I was very happy with the technicians that came out to trouble shoot my system. They actually came earlier than scheduled, which was great since my AC system had been out for 3 days.  After about 10 minutes, they found the problem and fixed it. Instant air! I couldn't be more happy with the technicians and Rowland Air. Great company and service!

<Text>Rowland Air Conditioning and Heating did an excellent job installing our Takagi Tankless Water Heater.  Jeff and Arlan's plumbing workmanship was first rate.  Cesar cut an inlet vent hole in our tile roof and even had red paint for the vent pipe and flashing.  It rained last night and the vents didn't leak a drop.  Our previous installation leaked for years.  Takagi provides perfect temperature control for our shower.< /Text>< time>

Excellent job, the guys were professional, fast and efficient. We’ve had the unit for 2 days and can’t believe how quiet it is. House heated up pretty fast and it got so warm we had to turn settings lower compared to old unit.  Thank you Rowland and Thank you Costco for the promotion and savings 😉🤗.  Can’t wait to get our gas and electric bills.<//Review>

< review>
We'd been without our heater since last winter, we had obtained a quote from the company who installed our system (now bankrupt) and were displeased with the "well it could be this, or this and maybe this" mystery quote. We decided to tough it out and look for another company to do business with. Rowland came highly recommended by a friend and we used them to repair our A/C this July when during during the 100+ heatwave it decided to quit. Our technician was honest and quick, and we decided to get a quote from them once fall rolled around. They came and gave us a quote for repair but we also wanted to explore new. Enter Chris M. This gentleman was very knowledgeable, highly professional and honest with his quotes and explained our options in detail. After taking the time to consider our options we decided to go with a new system, Chris returned promptly and we completed all paperwork which was carefully explained. Very pleased with the experience and would recommend to others.</review>

Always very pleased with the service.  I had a leak with my air conditioner and assumed it was a clogged pipe.  Jesse confirmed that it was.  He provided options for me to chose from and I opted for the clog repair, installation of a shut off switch and overall a/c service.  The PVC turned out to be very thin (not surprised as Sears did the original installation), so we decided to replace the PVC instead of clearing the clog.  While the work took some time, Jesse was very professional keeping me updated as he went and explaining how the switch worked once it was installed.  You have provided service to me many times (usually with Eric) and I am always pleased with the results.  I fell behind in my regular maintenance; I won''t let that happen again.<//Text>

Very happy with the service. Everyone was pleasant and accommodating and professional. Considering that I live in a townhouse where  the attic access is in my neighbor’s unit and could be accessed only at a certain time, they were able to work with it and did a great job. And I love the new air condition and heating unit that was installed- it heats/cools the place fast.</text>

<text>Eric Heyman serviced my equipment to today. He was very professional and friendly.. He assured me that it will keep me cool for the summer.

He discovered a leak. He informed me that the coil needed to be replaced and it was under warranty, however, the labor will be $2200.. My air conditioner has been a problem since it was installed.  Always the same thing—a leak..

I was upset, so I was offered to replace the system for $3700... this time it will be a different system and parts warranty 10 years and 1 year labor...

It’s a reoccurring nightmare... I can pay the high labor cost of $2200 or a placement the air conditioner for $3700 sounds like the same offer when I chose to get your system before...

I am disappointed, because I thought I was getting quality equipment and service.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I signed up for an air conditioner service appointment through the Lancaster, CA Costco about two weeks ago.  Rick was the technician that was assigned to my job.  He arrived on time and provided a thorough check and service of my system.  What made the service call even better was that he explained everything he was doing and gave me an excellent overview of the components of my system and how they were operating/should be operating.  You don't normally get this kind of in-depth tutorial from any type of service call.  Turns out I only needed some minor tweaks.  Rick did an awesome job.  He was incredibly friendly, informative, and professional. I would highly recommend him and Rowland Air....in fact, I already have.  He came out to check on my grandmother's system last night.<//Review>

Eric called me to let me know he was on his way. I met him at my house, politely greeted me and asked a few important questions pertaining to my ac unit. After checking things out he found that my freon was very low.
We agreed to recharge the system with freon, afterwards checked the inside temperature which was at 24 degrees. Eric also explained that after the 1st of the year, California laws are changing on replacing complete units.
Before he left he had put together an estimate for for replacing my old unit, plus if I were to have it done he would credit this visit and the last visit towards it. Both Eric and Thomas are very professional and courteous.</Text>< Pictures>

I would recommend Rowland Air to everyone. The technician show up when he said he would. Listened to what we thought was wrong. Which lead him to fix our furnace in less than a 1/2 hour. He also let us know that we would need to be replacing a part in the near future and that cost. Politely offered their warranty program. He was very professional and so nice. We will definitely be calling Rowland Air to make our future repairs.<//text>

The techs at Rowland Air have just become my new heroes!  After my air conditioning unit took its last breath, Eric H. came down to explain all my options and answered all my questions.  After an installation date was given, he was able to get the date bumped up, and within 72 hours the new unit was up and running.  Can’t say enough about his team, Ray and Marcos, who after the work was complete, ensured that everything was cleaned up and back to normal.  They will definitely be my number one referral for anyone looking for heating or air conditioning services.< /review>

I have my AC system serviced by Rowland Air yearly.  This was the first time Jesse serviced my system. Jesse arrived on time and was very professional for the outset.  He explained exactly what he planned to do to my system and went right to work.  I saw that his work habits were neat and methodical and he explained his findings throughout the service.  He discovered some minor issues with my system and provided recommendations.  He was pleasant and approachable as he answered my questions without hesitation.  Overall great experience.< /Text>

<text>Chris and his team at Rowland Air are awesome!
They are very thorough and practical. As a customer, I appreciate the fact that they are recommending me something that they would do for their own home rather than simply suggesting a complete overhaul of my AC and furnace system because I wouldn’t know any better.
I definitely recommend Rowland Air if you need your AC looked at and repaired!</text>< GmapID>

<Review>Contacted Rowland Air to get an estimate on a new air conditioning and heating unit.  Brett showed us the different unit types and their capacities.  He was able to answer all of our questions and we were able to pick the unit we thought would work best for us. The unit was installed 18 Sept 2018, and everything works as stated.  Installation staff was very professional and answered our questions during the installation.  Brett was available for any additional questions we had.</Review>< Pics>

I talked to Chris several times before his initial visit. He was pleasant and professional on the phone. He was even better in person. He is very knowledgeable and helped  us maximize our rebates. I have a few weeks to go before the installation but am so confident in a successful installation that I'm posting this in advance. Everyone I have talked to at Rowland Air have been helpful in every way. Great company to deal with.< /review>

Our heater went out. After getting other quotes we decided to use a company who installed Costco products. The Sales Rep secured a next day installation, my mother will be 95 this year and does not do well with the cold. The installers were in and out and cleaned up after themselves and very professional. It is so nice to not wear a coat in the house. Thank you for taking care of us so quickly.

Rowland Air showed up on time with the necessary equipment and crew to complete the system installation promptly.  We were extremely happy with the workers, who were careful not to leave a mess in the house or outside.  They replaced the air conditioning & heating units and installed all new duct work.  The price was very competitive as we had multiple bids.  We now have an energy efficient, really quiet system that keeps us warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  We have already recommended Rowland Air to our friends and will continue to do so in the future.</review>

<review>Eric came out as part of the LADWP Optimization Plan. He was polite, knowledgeable,  and patient. Everything you would want in a service tech. He explained everything he was doing and allowed to do under the plan. He has been with Rowland Air over 15 years and explained that it was a family run business. He knew the model of our air conditioner very well and although it is still quite new, he said we were using the wrong filter. While everything else checked out great I would love to have Eric as our maintenance guy going forward. He cared about his work and his customers.<//review>< userid>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Rick came out and spent 4 hours with my wife and myself.  He detailed every step of our new A/C and Heating system.  He was very specific about the costs, installation, warranty and follow up service.  His detail made it easy for us to decide to go with Costco/Rowland Air.  The system is working great, can hardly wait to see the energy savings.  The installation technicians sent out here by Rick were very professional and detailed as well as personable.   We are very happy and would recommend Rick and his company anytime.</review>< pics>

<review>We called Rowland Air because they’ve taken care of us since they installed our house system in 2010.  Today, Jesse Mora came to assess an issue with our cooling system that our recent twice yearly maintenance visit failed to detect (by a poor technician we prefer not to use, but was the only person available). Jesse spent 1 1/2 hrs here, detailing every step he took, educating us and giving superb, patient care to each step. After rigorous detective work, Jesse decided adding coolant was the mostly likely help for our concerns. Immediately, we felt a pronounced difference in air temperature and thrust.  We were told that there may be a slow leak somewhere in our lines from outside to our unit inside, we’re given pricing for the issue to be assessed, and NO SALES PITCH to pressure us to do anything now. Jesse was on time, courteous, and we highly recommend him. Also, we got an appointment set for within 3 hours of our call! We do have a maintenance contract with Rowland Air which helps with discounts, preferred appointments and we suggest having one if you like the service!<//review>< resp>

<Text>Jesus Mora, the excellent Service Technician: arrived on time; wore booties on his shoes to keep my white carpets clean; diagnosed the problem with my air conditioning system; and was very polite. The problem was not with the thermostat, as I had thought, but with the circuit board on the machine in the attic (plus one other part on that machine).  He has the circuit board on order and will return in one or two days, as soon as the parts arrive, and install them.  He had to go up and down my 16 steps to where I live, plus his ladder steps to the attic dozens of times and never complained at all. What a great person to work with!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Highly recommend Rowland Air. My A/C unit broke in the middle of summer and Rowland Air replaced it within a couple of weeks. Brett took his time to break down everything that I would need and inspected everything necessary before giving me a quote. While waiting for install Brett also provided me a portable A/C unit. Mario, Rolando and Edward installed my Lennox A/C unit in a timely manner, while performing quality work.< /Text>

<Review>For the past two years, Rowland Air has been our go-to company for our heating and air conditioning needs.  Their knowledge and honesty has been displayed throughout the time of service and installation of our equipment.  Service tech Rick was very helpful in our choice of a badly needed heating replacement to go with our recent air conditioning unit which we purchased roughly two years ago.  I highly recommend Rowland Air (that's R-O-W-L-A-N-D, because there are similar named heating and air conditioning companies out there.  Make sure you get the right one!)  Rick's entire team are very helpful and friendly.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>EXCELLENT WORK. They showed up on time, and only 3 hours after I made my original call on a Saturday! Eric was the best and his assistant Brendan was also awesome.  I will recommend you guys to anyone needing work on their AC.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Excellent. OnTime and did a great job. We’ve been using Roland Air for the past 10 years. Highly recommended. They replaced our second HVAC unit and were able to do some minor maintenance work on our existing unit as a courtesy. Much appreciated. Andrew, and his two coworkers where respectful of our property and took great care in protective covering of our floors. They were great workers and did a fantastic job. We’ll use the again.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Gerardo was on time, took his time to check out the entire system, change filters, do basic cleaning. He was really respectful of our home, took extra care to do neat, clean work.  Rowland Air installed our entire HVAC system in 2008. Gerardo was the best tech they've ever sent out to do our maintenance work.</Text>< time>

Every phone call was taken- every question was answered. When they came onsite, their workers were professional and explained every detail - every step of the way. There were no surprises or anything unexpected. I am BEYOND happy that all was handled quickly and professionally.< /Review>< pics>

Rick from Rowland Air came out today to do a pm on my HVAC,  he was very professional, he explained to me what he was going to do, in a matter that I understood. After completing his work he cleaned the area and went over the invoice with me. I highly recommend him.</text>

This review is for Rick Caron, a Sr. Service Technician for Rowland Air, Inc.
I had the pleasure of having Rick service our central A/C. Not only was he able to fix the issue quickly but also he was very courteous and professional, and arrived on time. It turned out the issue was a stuck damper due to bad motor which blocked the air from flowing through the vents.  The damper has been left open until the motor is replaced. I was very satisfied with the work he had done. If you ever need a technician who is very knowledgeable to service your A/C, contact Rowland Air and ask for Rick.
They are qualified to service ANY make/model.</review>

< review>
Rowland Air replaced my furnace 10 years ago and I recall being very happy with their service. So when my AC died on Friday, July 6, the record breaking day for high temperatures, I called them. Eric was able to come out the next day to inspect and advise. My old system was toast and a replacement was installed on Monday, July 9. I don't know how they pulled this off with all the calls they must have received during this heat wave, but I call this great service. My experience with Rowland Air has been nothing but terrific.<//review>

< Review>
Contacted Rowland Air with an emergency issue on a hot Saturday afternoon suggesting that there was a problem with the installation of my new HVAC system.  They sent a technician immediately and prevented what could have been a disaster.  They were able to unplug blockage in my drainage system and the technician was very friendly and recommended that we have it checked once a year.  Good job.</Review>

Besides the workers and sales person, some of my experience with this company has not been good. After installation, that same day my A/C was not working. My house got up to 90 degrees that night. In the morning I called to get the unit checked out and I got a service window from 1-6. 6 o’clock came around and nobody called to let me know if anyone was showing up or not. I called just before six to get an update and nobody answered!! Very disappointed in how things are being handled in the middle of summer to top it off!<//text>

<Review>Honestly, I would love to leave 5 stars because the unit itself works well. However, Rowland’s customer service needs a great deal of improvement. I had mybunit installed on July 31, and I had nothing but trouble until mid-November. I saw multiple error messages on the touch screen, and I think there was a Rowland rep at my house, trying to decipher and resolve the issue, perhaps a dozen times. Communication is severely lacking, and I was the person to initiate all the calls and subsequent appointments to get to the heart of the matter.
For the amount I paid for the unit I expect excellent customer service. Very disappointed.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c289acaf127ce3:0x30f7059f0b8ea55b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Had an amazing experience recently with Rowland air. Eric came out a few days ago to look at my system which hadn't been serviced in over 3 years. He was very quick and efficient with his other support worker identifying my needs and getting the system back to code. He called before hand, and also showed up on time based on the schedule window.

Erix was very experienced with my system and as I live in a condo, he was also very familiar with the HOA ruled. He let me know that although my system is old and could be replaced, he was more than happy to to complete the maintenance and fix a part to keep it running as long as it could.

As he didn't have the part available, he came back two days later to complete the install.

What I really liked about Eric, was not only was he friendly and knowledgeable, he also clearly communicated different options on keeping the same system, installing a new one, and the savings involved. Best part, with the year warrenty, if I opt for a new system in the future, the fix is applied to future costs.

I had a great experience and would recommend Eric and Rowland air.< /Review>< Pictures>

Eric Heymann and his partner arrived 1/2 an hour early to provide maintenance service for our heating unit.  He and his partner were very friendly, professional, and courteous.  They completed the job in about 10-15 minutes.  My wife Jeanny and I appreciated their professional attitudes in their work. They have a very good public relation with their customers which is hard to find nowadays.  We would highly recommend Rowland Air to anyone who needs Air Conditioning & Heating service.< /text>

<Text>Rick and his OJT Assistant, Dave, were professional, personable and most accommodating.
They both told me what they were going to do, made recommendations to update and improve my AC/Heating elements and checked my attic duct work ... first time in over twenty years anyone had done it.
The $69 inspection, etc., became a $450+ bill ... I believe it was a purchase of value for me and brought my AC/Heating elements current.
They owe me a filter and will bring it in Nov-Dec when again scheduled for whatever maintenance may be necessary.
On a Scale of 1-10, 10 being the best ... 10!</Text><Date>1430880111686</Date><user_id>111912436103791509858<//user_id>< resp>

Scott has always been courteous and professional. He has made working with Rowland Air a pleasant experience.

Eric has also been a pleasure to work with. He has always been courteous and professional.

11/07/19

Rowland Air came out to service our  HVAC. The gentleman who arrived on time was through and professional. They have kept our HVAC system working at peak performance winter, spring, summer, and fall. Everyone I have interacted with have been courteous, professional, and friendly.
I would recommend Rowland Air to anyone needing to service or replace their HVAC system.
If you are a Costco member they have some special deals.

09/19/2020

We had an issue with the AC unit on the side of the house being very noisy.  We contacted Rowland Air. Mike and Eric came out and immediately knew what the problem was. It was a defective motor and fan. They ordered the parts and Eric came out 3 days later on a Saturday and replaced them. It only took about 30 minutes and the unit is quieter tan when it was new. These people are professional, knowledgeable, reliable and friendly.

I would highly recommend them to anyone needing a new or service to an existing heating/air conditioning system.</Text>

I bought a new Lennox system thru Costco which took 2 days to install.  I've decided to break down this review by groups:

Sales Guy:  He was courteous, listened to what my wife and I were looking for, provided advice and did a good job.

Installers:  They showed up within the hours provided by our appointment.  They put down drop clothes to protect our carpet from upstairs to the front door.   They did a good job cleaning up at the end of both days.  The work was done very professionally.  They pointed out important features of our new system such as where the drain line drained into one of our sinks and provided a lot of good information.   They stayed late the 2nd day until they were finished.

The company in general.  They provided a portable AC unit free of charge for our 1 night without AC (The sales guys informed us this was possible to get during the day when our system was down, but he also told us we would have AC back on at the end of the first day.  The only AC we had was the portable, so I'd have been very unhappy if this hadn't happened).

All in All, they did a great job and I was very happy.  My only negatives are as follows:
There were a couple of times over the 2 days where they left the front door open.  I never said anything about it, just closed it when this happened.  They tried to move our out door sink which is plumbed and has a drain line.  Obviously, this wasn't happening, but they pulled the drain out when attempting this.  My wife noticed that night and had to put it back in.  Finally, the text message I received the day prior to the appointment was broken into 6 parts saying "We are confirming your appointment .... Due to the high demand we must obtain a confirmation to keep it..."   I confirmed, called them to make sure I was good for both days.  If I hadn't seen the text or forgot to respond I'm not sure what would have happened.  They sent the same text for the 2nd days appointment, so would they have just not shown up?   I understand they are busy, but I really hope they follow up when there is not a response. As I had spoken to the office before the first day's appointment and to the installers at the end of the 2nd day, I didn't see the need for the 2nd days appointment confirmation text.

Once again, I'd like to emphasize all in all I WAS very happy with the job and new system though.<//Review>

<Review>Michael A was more than awesome!!! I would give him a 15 if the max was 10. Rowland Air should give him a big raise...he went over and beyond for us. In fact the whole crew Gerardo, Austyn, Marcos were all more than awesome! Complicated systems like HVAC will have problems. Scott, the installation and service manager was incredibly helpful in resolving them. My wife and I are happy campers! We would recommend Rowland Air to all of our friends and family. Thank you!

Eric came out to do the heater inspection for the coming winter. He was professional and efficient. I had a problem with the carbon monoxide detector and he said he will replace it on his next visit. Thank you Eric.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I was going to be sold 10-15 thousand dollar air and heating system by a company called NEXGEN AIR. They inspected my system and said I had internal cracks in it leaking carbon Monoxide. I called Rowland Air to give me a bid. Rick from Rowland inspected the system and found nothing wrong with it.  he said there was a piece of insulation material that came loose and was suffocating the system, causing it to shut off.   I paid  120 dollars plus a couple carbon monoxide detectors and saved thousands of dollars simply because He was honest.   Thanks a lot Rick< /Text>

2019: Same heat pump, 3 years after my first review.  Heat pump quit on us one very cold night.  Called Rowland and they sent Eric and GiovannI to diagnose and fix the problem.  it was determined that the wiring (under the house) was defective.  They came back a few days later with a 3rd gentleman, Gerardo, and spent some time successfully rewiring the unit to the thermostat connection.  They were on time, polite, patient, cleaned up after themselves and answered all my questions.  They really cared that I was happy and that goes a long way with me.

2016: My heat pump was installed a year ago. When I switched the unit from Heat to Cool, I found that the unit wouldn't turn on.  I called Roland Air and they sent out a service person, Kenneth,  the very next day.  Kenneth was personable, smart and very helpful. He fixed the problem quickly, tested it in both Cool and Heat modes, and changed out the filter while he was at it, plus changed out the filter of a 2nd unit, also fixing it so I wouldn't have to wrestle with it to get it to close.  In addition, he gave me some tips to increase the unit's efficiency.  Kenneth is definitely an asset for the company.</text>

<review>The rep that came to our home was helpful and knowledgeable. In explaining the details of what he recommended, he spoke in HVAC talk, but in a way that both my fiance and I could understand. Anything that did need a little extra explanation he did so in a way that satisfied our concerns.

I hold back on the 5th star because its a little silly to have to write a review before we can see our quote, let alone before agreeing to the terms and going forward with such a serious upgrade to our home.<//review>< pics>

Eric just came to our home and did the LADWP Optimization on my old Carrier unit.  He was courteous, professional, and full of answers for all of my detailed questions.  Although my 24 year old unit was functioning properly, it was only running at about 5-6 SEER.......working, but costly!
Eric took the time to talk about replacement units (details, yes!), and their rebate perks and Efficiency benefits (power cost savings)!
We will likely be calling him back for a complete inspection (attic also), to
replace the old system.
Thank you Eric for the friendly and informative service!
Cheers!

Rowland Air is GREAT honest company. Eric from Rowland Air was very helpful.  Eric came out to give me a quote for 3 mini split units for upstairs because our existing unit wasnt cooling off the upstairs.  Eric was the 5th inspector that came out he toid me he was the i spector that put in my existing unit many years ago & have been here to service the init after that Eric the inspection told me the best then to do first is the Air Ducts upstairs that would increase your air flow by at least 40%.& it did. Thanks Eric for your true & professional work. I highly recommend using g Rowland Air<//Review>

We got a Great price from Rick on a central air unit, (Lennox).  Rick stated they'd have the job done in 2 days.  I wasn't sure that was possible, with all the duct work that needed to be done.  True to his word, in 2 days, we had a gorgeous, whisper quiet, perfectly working central unit in our home.  We've been using it about a month now, and we are ecstatic about the unit.  They installed a new heater, and 3 ton in the yard.  All electrical, duct work, and venting, We're done quickly, but more importantly, correctly, and cleanly.  When the techs left our home both days, they cleaned every speck of dust from the job.  The heater work is so clean, and beautifully done, as is the unit in the yard.  I've never seen a cleaner install.  Looking in the attic, all the duct work is neat, and properly secured, new vents look great throughout our home, wiring outside is neatly done.  Rick came by a couple times a day during the install, just to make sure we were happy with each step of the work.  I couldn't recommend a company more highly than Roland, or an adviser more friendly, knowledgeable, and professional than Rick.  Everything done as promised, with no bs. Beautiful work!< /text>

RE:  Work Performance

SHORT VERSION:
Your demo / installation team consisting of employees CURTIS, DUSTIN and BENJAMIN were EXCEPTIONAL!

LONG VERSION:
As you may be aware, on or about June 12, 2019, I met with Chris Michailov who wrote an efficient and quite acceptable work order for removing, disposing existing duct system and installation of new R8 ducting system.  Work was scheduled for July 1, 2019.

The demo / installation team consisting of CURTIS, DUSTIN and BENJAMIN arrived as scheduled on Monday, July 1, 2019.  The three of them immediately commenced working the job.

Their politeness, courtesy and work ethic are Top Drawer! Without request or solicitation I have decided to let you know that Curtis and his team were Exceptional.  Curtis displayed great leadership and kept Dustin and Benjamin on task.

My dad was an electrical contractor.  I helped him wire many residential and commercial buildings . . . it was hard work.  While still attending college I worked for a concrete contractor, first doing manual labor then eventually Fresno round end finishing . . . again, it was hard work.  Sheet metal fabrication, tearing out and replacing flex ducting during the summer is . . . you guessed it – hard work!

The temperature outdoors today, July 1, 2019, was 101degrees+ (when I glanced at our electronic outdoor thermostat at 11am).  I was perfectly comfortable with running our AC at 66degrees (Rowland installed our Ruud system some years back) to allow conditioned air to circulate the attic space while the three were busily working.

It’s not easy finding skilled, hardworking craftsmen . . . but you have three of the best in Curtis, Dustin and Benjamin.

I will hand deliver a copy of this letter to Chris Michailov when he does his walk around with me.

Thank you again for continued great service and workmanship.

Respectfully submitted,

Rowland did a complete central heating and air system replacement in my home.
GREAT company !!!
I used the same company for 14 years and fired them for dishonesty and dangerous installation practices that jeopardized the safety of my family.
Rowland Air is now my go to company for all heating and Air concerns. Honest, Professional and courteous are just a few of the positive experiences I had with this company. If you are looking for a company you can trust with your families safety then call Rowland Air.
Another year of maintenance by Rowland Air. Great job as always (Oct. 2020).< /Text>

I was so happy with my experience with Rowland Air, Inc team. The girls, Claudia and Rebecca, who answer the phone, were so sweet, professional, and answered all my initial questions about Rowland Air services.  I decided to hire them for my air conditioning problem. I was given the technician's name that same day, then I received an email with the photo of the technician; who does that? I was impressed even more.  The day of the appt. I was called by the office letting me know that my technician was on his way.  I then received a call from the technician also confirming that he would arrive soon.  Eric arrived shortly after.  He was so professional and answered all my questions regarding the air conditioning unit.  He did not try and sell me unnecessary parts or push a yearly maintenance plan.  I would call Rowland Air, Inc. for any problems in the future.  It is so hard to find a company now a days that is honest, informed, and customer service oriented; it was refreshing to receive this type of care.  If you have any problems with your unit, do not hesitate to call Rowland Air, Inc.</Text>

Rowland Air is the best!  We have used them for the past several years whenever our AC unit needed repair.  They are always prompt, professional, courteous and reasonably priced.  When we experienced another problem with our AC recently, we called Rowland Air and Erich gave us the bad news that our 23-year-old system would need a major upgrade to continue to function efficiently.  Even though the final cost was much higher than we had hoped, we are very happy with our new Lennox HVAC system.  Erich and the other Rowland Air technicians who came to do the work were professional, courteous and efficient.  Erich explained the entire process to us and they completed the work within the promised time frame.  I highly recommend Rowland Air!< /Text>

< Review>
I got them through costco. Their installation and price is ok, the problem is that their service consultant promised that they will help me upgrade my gold membership to executive for the 2% cash back. It's just a $20 thing, it's minor, but it took me several phone calls to check and finally figured out that I need to do myself. It's a waste of time and effort.< /Review>

Gerardo of Rowland Air was very knowledgeable and efficient. He’s an asset to the company. He perfomed an excellent job on my ac to bring the unit in top shape. Thanks to Rowland as contractor participating in LADWP’s Ac optimizatin program!  Many thanks to LaDWp especially for this valuable program. It has saved me money by making
our home more energy efficient.</Review>

And this Rowland crew from quote to install were outstanding.  Jeff, Marcus, Josh, Justin and a couple of others were professional, knowledgeable, and just very good at their jobs.  From the quote from Brett to finish 1st class service.  They were not the lowest bid, and probably on the higher side, but for once I got what I paid for... now it is up to Lennox to do it's job and run for as many years or more than my last Lennox.

I thought my 1st install by the last company was good...until I compared them to this job... there is no comparison!  I found where the last guys did short cuts and just shoddy work... this Rowland team were pros - ALL of them.  (and I paid top dollar last go around - no wonder my AIR was NEVER up to par - but when you don't know, you don't know - Know I know!)

I crossed off the local phone # for my last guys and will only call Rowland for service and advice going forward.  Just hope the unit I bought is as reliable as Rowland..

UPDATE: 12/2018 - Thomas was sent out for FREE maintenance check since install.  This guy knew what what was doing, knew the system, checked out everything, answered a couple of questions... All in all top flight person, good at what he does - personable, professional... This is the quality people that Roland sends out in the field... and this is why NOBODY but Rowland Air will touch my Lennox.<//Text><response>None</response></record>

<Date>1521289796470<//Date><rating>5<//rating><text>We had a wonderful experience with Rowland.  We bought our home recently and the original system seemed wrong and wasteful.  The home didn't appear to cool/heat right no matter our strategy, electric bills always high even if used only at night, and bedroom cooling seemed weak. We didn't know what was wrong and thought it was normal so we stopped over at Costco and met Breann to talk A/C.  She got us all setup with an inspection with Ron and with our tough work schedule Rowland had many ways to accommodate us from inspections to installation and it was so simple and comforting. We went through Costco for a company we could trust and they were transparent on the process and our options.  They did provide simple solutions upfront to our problem, but I elected saving money on bills and invested up front on removing our Frankenstein system and upgrading for a new balanced 2 zone Fernice & A/C units for system operation of bedrooms independant of rest of our home.  We felt in control of the process; Breann stayed the hub throughout and reacted out to us for scheduling, Ron kindly addressed our home issues and setup install, Scot clearly laid out the install plans, and the installers we so clean and considerate with our home.  Oh and the system is so quiet, they said it was going to be noisy but it purrs compared to our last, I feel the air instead of hear it.  It transcends the zones so evenly and cools & heats so efficiently.  The controls are simpler than my last, missing some capability for the phone app, but it's fine our usage was always simple on/off versus scheduled programming (the wall interface has scheduling though).  The controls are very sleek though and easy to navigate, I like the the tiny zone control in my room. Oh and and they walk us through system operation and maintenance, my first home so honestly didn't know how these thing work.  Turns out not much to it, they'll follow up with us for the first year.

<review>I set up an appointment with Rowland Air through Costco. Rick C. came out to give me an estimate for my HVAC system. He did more than that. He gave me all the information I needed to make a wise decision. Rick spent the time to explain to me how HVAC systems work. He did a cursory inspection so that he could recommend a system that would work for me.
After a few days I decided to go with Rowland Air. The crew that showed up on installation day were very professional. Rick also paid attention to my personal requests like relocating the condensor unit and gas outlet. The crew know thier job and are knowledgable regarding local code requirements so that they can provide an excellent installation the first time. And in a single day. They showed up at 8am, left by 6, and removed all old parts and trash when they left.
Rick personally followed through the entire process from estimate, installation, and follow up. This included Rick coming by a week later to test the system.
The bottom line is Rick delivered everything he promised Rowland Air would do. Rick's presentation was very low pressure and at the same time professional and informative. He told us how to save money wherever possible. Including Costco, Rowland Air, and local power company discounts. I'm very pleased with Rick C. and Rowland Air.< /review>< Pictures>

My ac is barely a year old when it stopped working. Calling them cost me $250 and a whopping $2900 if they clean out dust and change the filter duct. I think I learned my lesson. Never call them again.<//Review>

My land lord hired this wonderful company to come out and replace a heater in my home which had been red tagged. On the day that Eric came out to do an inspection of the old heater, he was SOOOOOO detailed and concerned for my family!!! It made me feel so at easy that they were going to do their best to fix the problem and make my home warm again. They thought there was a possibility that they would not be able to come out till the following week to replace my heater, which I understood. But the very next morning Eric called me to tell me he was concerned about my house  being cold and did what they could to make it happen faster ;) So instead of it being installed on a Thursday, they came Monday morning!!!! They said they would call when they were on their way, but were scheduled to be there at 9:30. They called me at 9 and said they would be there in 20-30 min and they WERE!!!!!!! They came when they said they were going to!!!!! The two men who came to my home (which I am a single mom, so I think all of us have that little fear of being alone with people you dont know) were so polite and soooo quite!!!! They talked amongst themselves and you could barely hear what they were saying!!!! They were soooo professional as well!!! They cleaned up the mess that was made and when they left it was like nothing had been done ;)  Except for having this brand new beautiful heater in the wall ;)  They explained to me how it worked and Eric even came back before the guys left to re-inspect their work, which I thought was BEYOND professional!!! The office staff is friendly and warm and I just am very impressed!!!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend this company to everyone I know!!!!</Review>

<review>Rick C was professional and found the problem with my air conditioner very quickly. He demonstrated what was wrong, how a particular part was not working and replaced it. His rate/price for the part and service seemed fair as well. I would definately call this company again and ask for Rick.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>I needed them as my AC broke while it was over 100 degrees outside. They came less than 30 mins after my call. I give a 4, just because it was more expensive than I tough. $325 for a starter ... while the AC is just 4 years old.< /review>< GmapID>
