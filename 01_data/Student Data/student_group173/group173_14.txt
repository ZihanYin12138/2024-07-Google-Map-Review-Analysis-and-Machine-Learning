UNITS is GREAT and I highly recommend them.  They are a local company and treated me very well.  I tried to call a national company that offers the same services and was treated like a number.  Well not UNITS.  Dee runs the storage units and delivered a storage unit to my driveway.  We filled it over the weekend and Dee picked it up the following week.  Dee is great, on time, friendly, honest and punctual.  I prefer using local companies and UNITS is exactly why I prefer this.  Highly recommended.</review>

<review>I was very impressed with UNITS. Weeks after I made my reservation, I wanted to change the drop off date. I needed to start my renovation project a week or so earlier than planned. UNITS were able to make it work, and dropped off the storage unit earlier for me. They also price matched, which was a plus. All together UNITS met and exceeded my expectations. I would gladly use them again in the future.<//review>< gmapID>

< Review>
We have used Staxup Units for five years.  In every case they have provided us with information we needed to plan our use of their PODS, they have shown up when promised. Dee, who is at the moment doing both the job of manager and driver, found the time to coordinate the last step in our use of the PODs, delivery to our new home.  He has superb skills as a driver and last week we got to see his excellent managerial skills as he coordinated the schedule with us.  The pods were clean, in excellent condition and kept our belongings dry and safe.  We couldn't ask for anything more.  Thanks Dee!</Review>

<text>This is the third time we have used Units to move us and I couldn't be more pleased. The staff is professional and courteous, making it easy to schedule the drop off and pick up of the Units. The Units are clean and safely stored until we were ready for delivery to our new home. They work closely with the packing company to make for ease of communication and scheduling.

I highly recommend Units Moving and Portable Storage of San Diego to anyone in need of moving/storage services.</text><time>1597430439280<//time>< user_name>

For most it’s a good company. When I had my Unit delivered I wasn’t asked what position it should be placed in the parking lot, fortunately, there was enough room to maneuver the trailer and it turned out okay. It got better when Dee had taken over the operations. I would recommend them to a friend.</text>

<review>This company put a storage unit in the driveway of our neighbor. The pictures speak for them selves. I was concerned for the safety of any kids or pets who might happen to crawl under there and retrieve a ball or something. This looks highly unstable and is too high off the ground! I called Adam Martin at Units, and he told me they have never had any problems with liability and have never had an accident. All it takes is one accident and a fatality, Adam!  Do we really have to wait for that before this company will come and fix this? When I first called him, his attitude was "that's how we have always done it." That was not comforting, so then my dad called him from out of town (after seeing the pictures I sent him), and the guy gave my dad the same song and dance. Then my dad mentioned Units would have a lawsuit into the millions if someone gets hurt. Adam finally agreed to send someone to fix it. We are still waiting. I also had the police call Adam as well, just to make sure this gets fixed. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY PLEASE!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMR_I624Gyc7ZDLknr3chzI6T0Los4wAt5_7G15=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONTcI1VitOC5UZ0WNqRaE5J7O939kKfUnyXgf2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkHyCKajiSi9Q2B3oW5VlioKVSSSJViSlKyraW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics></record>

So far I've only rented a storage unit.  Service is good and prices are reasonable. I would recommend this place to friends.
UPDATE 9/10/2020, I wanted to add that my wife and I are moved and UNITS has our containers in their storage. "D" in San Diego is the man to go to for all your moving needs in short distance transport. If you need long distance transport he can hook you up with KIM who is their long distance Coordinator. They provided local movers in both California and Arizona to assist with loading and unloading our containers. I will update with the info after we finally move in to our new house.< /Text>

I have used 3 different companies over the past 4 months to clear out the estate from my parent's home.  Units was the 3rd company.  I booked the listing through the location in Charleston, SC and specifically worked with "Jody Howell" to book the trailer.  I have not had this outstanding of customer service is the past 10 years... in any industry.  She was compassionate, friendly, efficient, thorough, and simply kind.  I give the highest praise to this company for employing such people as Jody.  Kudos.< /Review>

UNITS Mobile Storage provided exceptional customer service! They helped make a stressful move so much easier! They were right on schedule with pick up and delivery and didn't provide a large window of delivery/pick up times as their competitors typically do. Thank you to Lisa, Grace and the rest of the UNITS team! I am a huge fan and will refer you to anyone moving or remodeling in the San Diego area!<//Text>

The reviews for other mobile storage services scared me. So with a little more research, I came across Units SD, who had great reviews on Yelp. I'm happy I chose this local company. They had great customer service that made the whole process easy. The drop-off, pick-up, and final delivery were smooth. All of my belongings came back in the same shape I packed them in. This was so much better than driving back-and-forth from a storage unit on move days, and I found the price to be comparable to a first floor "drive-up" storage unit. I was still able to access my stuff in between moves, if I wanted to.</Review>

UNITS! UNITS! UNITS! UNITS! UNITS!!!!!!
I researched costs all around town and Units was the choice. I thought I might get what I payed for in customer service but the Staff and Drivers were 100% professional and showed up when they said they would. They were able to perform delivery and pick up in the time frames I provided. I found the items that I stored in the Unit exactly as I had left them when I opened it up. Units Mobile Storage is the only call you have to make when moving or storing your belongings</Review>

SD Units Mobile storage is the best. They work with me when I give them very little notice, they pick up on time and their customer service is great.
They also help the local San Diego Habitat for Humanity affiliate with donated and discounted units.<//text>

They were great to service me, however a lot of the stuff I paid for, “New” Belts, Pumps, Radiator, Pulleys. Looked very used. It’s my fault for not seeing them correctly. I just got very lazy to even notice. Sadly I am already out of warranty. But if I could purchase a motor again. I would do it. No other place has them good like these guys.< /text>

I bought an engine form these guys had no compression in two cylinders they then sent a "replacement" that was only a long block and wasn't even the same motor that I ordered then proceeded after I disputed the charge they come and pick up their motor and still tell my bank that they sent me a motor. They took my money and left me with nothing do. Not. Trust. Them.

My mechanics absolutely didn't say it had compression... I have documents from multiple mechanics stating it didn't (pictures are posted) and videos.  I can post the videos also if you guys want to continue to  tell lies. you could have picked up the bad engine but instead you took the replacement and here's a picture of the rusted frozen turbo and one of the mechanics documents stating that it doesn't have compression.</review>

Sends bad engines then won't help with the cost of installing the next engine so you'll end up paying for engines swaps untill you get a Good one. Not to be trusted< /Review>

I ordered a transmission from these guys. Price was fair, shipping was quick, but the transmission sent will not work with my application. I was told that I told them the wrong year of my car. I asked for them to arrange s return and refund. The gentleman helping me insisted he send me another. 2 days later I was told I needed to pay shipping because it would cost him too much. I agreed out of need.  I became very frustrated. The agent clearly was frustrated as well,  kept saying I need to send back his transmission and he will refund me. After 2 days of phone discussion, he arranged freight to pick it up, but I could not leave work in the middle of the day to meet them, as no appt was made. Still no replacement.  5 more days past, no replacement, no refund. Placed several calls and did not hear back. Called  a fourth time and was told by the agent I had been working with that it was shipped, but an employee put the wrong address and instead it went to their shop. Said it would ship on Monday again. Monday came...no confirmation, I called again. On Tuesday I called again and  finally got an invoice confirming shipment. I later received a call and was told I would be refunded the extra cost I paid for shipment. Then later received an email requesting to change my review.
Overall, most of this could have been avoided, but as I have learned there was a bit of a language barrier. I feel like the agent has tried to help, but we don't always understand what the other person said / meant which has unfortunately left me 3 weeks without a car taking up a garage space I planned to rent for 3 days. Company could do better. I think they mean well, but need to get their act together.</Review>

Ali did great with getting my Subaru WRX running , him and his crew we're able to give a quick turnaround . I didn't run into any problems . Overall cost was cheap for both engine and labor compared to a normal car shop who wanted to charge me 5500 for a USED engine . I payed 750 for mine .< /Review>

Purchase your engine and transmission from some were else. i purchased a full jdm swap for a Subaru impreza which consist of engine, transmission, and differential. when i received the swap. my mechanic installed the full swap and turns out the transmission they sent me was bad. i called the Asian guy, i believe his name was Ali, and he said they had no other transmission in stock. so it took them about a month to send another one to me. so keep in mind that my car was sitting the whole time i was waiting on these idiots to send me another transmission. when my mechanic received the transmission they installed it and then went  me turn the car on the engine had a loud tick sounds like a valve tick or a lifter tick one of those. i then called this idiot back which i believe was ALI. i told him what is going on with the engine and he asked for me to send him a video of the sound, so i did what he asked. so the next day he called me and said "he couldn't cover the engine because it was out of warranty and he said that i must of blew the engine the first time we installed the first transmission in it". how the hell was i going to blow engine when i didnt even get to take it home cause the first transmission was bad. so now my mechanic had to tear the head apart on the engine and see what is going on with it. i was probably better getting an engine from the junk yard than from these snakes.

People trust me and dont waste your time and money with this idiot called Ali.< /review>

Bought a replacement d series transmission for my 97 dx civic. To my surprise they delivered a del sol transmission. Best 300 spent yet. Way better gear ratios than that dx and has lasted a year now used daily maybe 30k later. Looking to upgrade to b20 with a b16 trans. Won't buy from any other guys. Keep it up folks<//Text>

<Review>I have a 1996 honda prelude that needed an engine swap. I called pretty much every jdm place in the area and everyone gave me different excuses either they didn't have the motor or didn't have any time for weeks. I finally went to jdm engine import and I talked to Alpha about my options, all of which he had in stock. After talking with him and seeing their shop I decided to go there and I ended up getting a h23a blue top which is what I wanted originally. The car is a 96 and the motor that broke was a 95 and a previous swap. I'm sure it was a nightmare for them to get everything working but they did and the car runs very well with no issues. I am very happy with the work done. The price was pretty much the same if not lower than all the other places I called and it took some extra time because of the previous swap and they didn't charge me extra for it. Overall I am extremely happy with my choice to take my car to there and I highly recommend anyone else to do the same.</Review><Response>None< /Response><name>Michael Hauser</name>< pictures>

< Review>
I needed an engine for a 2001 Honda Civic and I called a few places and most of them charge for delivery and I had no way of getting to them and I called jdm imports and they delivered the Motor free of charge and I got a great deal I would highly recommend them< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) If I came to buy an engine with my husband for my car but I did not bless what I wanted they said it was what I needed but the embio was 24 hours away and as it turned out it was not a simple car and I giving the instructions mine was of 4 × 4 and they said saw but they only deceived me and without being able to change it in the distance but the good thing I could sell it by other means

(Original)
Si vine a comprar un motor con mi esposo para mi carro pero no me bendiero lo que quería dijeron era lo que necesitaba pero el embio era a 24 horas de camino y al resultar no era era de carro sencillo y yo dando las instrucciones el mío era de 4×4 y dijeron sierra pero solo me engañaron y sin poderlo cambiar por lo lejos pero lo bueno lo pude vender por otro medio<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>Overall I'm happy that it's open again. No appointment required but you need the 24go app to sign in and agree you have no symptoms. The gym is clean but can get crowded since reservations are gone. Plenty of spray bottles to keep handles clean. Lockers and showers are open, but the pool is closed. There were no employees on the floor. I saw a few guys working out with masks under their chin, and a few on the cardio machines breathing heavy without masks. I wish they would enforce the mask rule. I also wish they would encourage hand-washing, but the sinks in the locker room only stay on 2 seconds after you put your hands in. It doesn't feel as safe as it should be, and could get shut down if they ignore the unmasked.<//review>< user_id>

This location is the only one within 50 miles of Joshua Tree. It is worth the drive. I do not know the area, but it is off of 10, in a town called Indio. Very clean, nice and welcoming staff and great equipment. Bathrooms are clean. Many weight benches are available and great free weights. Smaller swimming pool but nice. Parking is great and plenty of it. Nice little shop with gloves, bags and other merchandise. They have auto pay for when you want to purchase items.</Text>

I did not research remarks Before joining this gym. I am a new member as of a week and did NOT experience any of what was commented  in the one star comments. The gym is very clean and has all new equipment.
The only negative that I have so far is that there’s not enough classes.
All the people seem to be extremely friendly. I have a friend in town wanting to go to the gym with me so I will have to see if I have problems getting her into the gym on that three day pass. I will update this after my experience.<//text>

I visited this location over Memorial Week/Weekend 2013 visiting CA from out of town and was pleasantly surprised. Anthony Maio (Membership Manager) was very helpful introducing me to the facilities. Much friendlier than the Gold's Gym - Palm Springs, enough for me to make the 30 minute drive over to 24 Hour Fitness. If I am in the area again, I will be sure to return. Thanks again! :-)</Text>

The best 24 I've been too!  It has nice amenities, like the wet clothes spinner!  Large steam room and sauna and large whirlpool.  Basketball court did seem on the small end, but haven't play bb in years.< /Text>

Apparently, the staff believe it’s okay for certain men to physically threaten, intimidate and tout women because they don’t care to do anything about it but, blame the victim. Doesn’t look like I’m going back wo someone with me as I’m scared to be there by myself. Really poor customer service.< /text>

Do not waste you time coming here. I’m a local looking for a place to work out and I respectfully enters the gym did as told to be able to participate on a 3 day pass. The counter front desk looked at my ID said no problem made me do a survey and waited patiently for 30 mins for an interview. The sales coordinator looked at my ID and said I could not participate in the gym because It didn’t have a local adress. I explained that I just came back to move permentaely and I am just looking for a place to work out. He didn’t even apologize for making me wait so long, neither did he offer any other suggestion as to maybe pay for a day or something. Very unprofessional. Then 2 hours later I receive an email saying my pass was activated. NOW I can’t even have an opportunity to explore another 24 hour at any other location because of this. Terrible experience. I do not recommend. This location will most likely close soon and your money will be waisted. My family is in the local law enforcement and I will make sure that word spreads.</Text>

Went there this morning to workout with a friend who has a membership there. Signed the guest pass and waiver. Had the little tour. When it came down to the employee wanting to tell me about their deals and signup specials I let him know I was not looking to sign up right now I just wanted to workout with my friend. Right away he asked for my ID and proceeded to tell me he could not grant me a guest pass because I lived more than 20miles away from that gym. He did offer me a day pass for $20 dollars LOL I'm not sure if this is policies but that sounds RIDICULOUS. Needless to say I will not be going back again. Many other surrounding gyms give FREE day passes if not charge a $5 fee at MOST. If I wanted ppl to come join my gym I would allow them to experience it before trying to pressure them into a membership or scaring them off with the ridiculous day pass fee of $20. What a joke!. This was the 24hour in Indio CA.<//Text>

Terrible experience. Would not even waste my time at this location. I recently moved and I didn’t have a local ID and it’s my fault that I didn’t check online ahead of time. However, the counter/front desk personage checked both mine and my friend’s ID which both said our original origin and he said nothing. He made me and my friend wait 20 mins just for the sales person to tell us that we couldn’t get it. Like learn your job before working the front by yourself. Additionally, the sales man didn’t say any apology or any option to pay for a day, nothing. This location will eventually close if they keep this up.</review>

< Review>
I would have a team meeting with you night cleaning crew particularly with the African American front desk person! He seems very pushy and almost upset with guest when it ces time for him to do picking up of the weights which is understandable, however it part of his job! I just commenting on this issues because he seems to mad dog everyone working out at the time of cleanup! I come during the night becosue it is extremely pack ed during the day . So to have issues at night it's a lose lose situation. He should be spoken to about his approch!<//Review>

<text>The representatives not the front desk reps are unreasonable by trying too hard to make people sign up. Gym is a decent size but can’t expect much from this tier especially with incompetent reps.< /text>< GmapID>

< Review>
This gym is only 5 years old. It is horribly run down. Stationary bikes that are half broken, steam room filthy 3 lights, sauna stinky and dirty. People go into the steam room and sauna will fully clothed people,e smelly shoes and work out attire. Pool was closed for the annual cleaning and repair a week ago, scum on inside pool tile (black) The floor has many broken pieces of equipment form many months, not repaired. Shower area dirty, shower doors taken off, hair and trash in shower area. HORRIBLE CONDITIONS! This gym is neglected and no repairs or cleaning done. Lots of "trainers" no cleaning crews, sales people do not keep the members compliant with the gym rules. No air-conditioning in class room, broken during this heat.  The steam room frosted door has been scratched putt in parts, people sitting in the jacuzzi  and pool wearing street clothes. This place is a shame. Many new gyms opening in the area, many people are leaving the 24 Hour Fitness!</Review>

<review>It's a nice enough space, but I've never been to a gym where more equipment was either not functioning correctly or was "out of order". So much so that I'm leaving a review about it. This place could be great if more than 80 percent of the cardio and weigh machines worked.<//review>< Date>

<Text>It could be a nice gym... it has the potential, but unfortunately they neglect the up- keeping and the repairs. The steam room and sauna are stinky all of the time,the lights falling off from inside both sauna and steam rooms, or are just taken off not to replace, the drinking  fountains are broken and never repaired.... and so on.... they could hire a custodian and clean the gym and the equipment once in a while. I could go on and on, on the repairs, but I guess many members know that already.  I am thinking of leaving to another gym because of that reason.< /Text>< Rating>

Manager Nicolas Evans is the biggest scam artist in the 24 hour fitness.
He does not give out the 3 day pass
Only wanted money! customer service stinks! Avoid this place unless you want to be scammed.
If 24 hour fitness had more manager like Nicolas Evans .
24 hour fitness will go broke and bankrupt< /Review>

They would not allow me into the gym with my guest pass as i came into the gym too late, however when i called 24 hour fitness corporate they cearly stated that i should be able to redeem the pass with any member of 24 hour fitness that could sell a 1 day pass. The front desk representative said he could sell the pass but could not let me in on a guest pass. The front desk rep was doing only as he was told.

The worst part of this entire experience was the personal trainer that may have had anger issues, as when i was talking to the front desk rep he had to put his 2 cents in the most unorthodox way. He stated "calm down" in a very angry tone, when I was doing nothing more than talking to the representative. Brandon, the name of the personal trainer proceeded to look at me with a very intimidating look, which did not scare me, he continued to talk me as if I were a low life. Mind you i am handicapped, but I am not one to say anyone is discriminating, but he was acting as though he owned the club.

The two stars are for the 5 star service from the front desk rep Nicholas who has my utmost respect! I was going to come back into the gym to try it out but i don't know how i would be treated if this is normal behavior.

I feel the inconsistency of information from corporate to the club is upsetting and they are only looking for turnover instead of customer satisfaction. I stated i would be glad to set up an appointment with a membership counselor when they came in but that was not enough. I spent 20 minutes driving each way due to the incorrect information provided by corporate or the fact that this gym does not follow procedures from the headquarters. I will also write to the corporate office to state a point that the indio gym is not interested in customer service. Also that the personal trainer has anger issues that are pointed toward potential customers. Brandon is the main reason i do not want to go back to this club.

Seems a lot of the positive reviews are from people that were asked to leave a 5 star review, the 1 and 2 star reviews seem a lot more acurate.< /text>< pictures>

3 staff members gave me excuses and could not follow protocol when member creates hazardous environment for other members in the sauna. They were too lazy to clean up the hazardous waste or close the sauna until it was disinfected. Nasty, gross, dirty, and filthy environment.  The staff dropped the ball and gives me the impression that they dont care when members complain. This was a hazardous situation for everyone using the sauna!</Review>

Worst customer service I've ever encountered. I'm a Millitary veteran and still out sourcing and doing work for the military. There for I'm usually not able to go to gym much at all. The only reason I got membership was for indoor bball court as that's the only thing I care to do and it's to hot to play outside during the day and my schedule will not permit it so I can play late at night. I also go to the gym maybe 3-4 times max in a month and sometimes I won't go for months. I severely hurt my back overseas and I'm just now getting healed up and able to get back on basketball court and play a sport that I love. Unfortunately there was an issue with my account as my wallet was stolen and my card on file was reported stolen along with all my other cards and they froze most of my accounts as there was numerous fraudulent activities going on and so forth so I was dealing with that head ache. I drove down from the base on three separate occasions and was able to go in with no issue and play ball with my buddies it was very late around 11pm-12/1am when I'm free. All the staff members were amazing and really receptive and genuinely engaging and on top of their job. The last time I went I dealt with this gentleman by the name of Brendan. He was the rudest person I've ever had to deal with in my entire life. he basically was barking at me and had this sly grin on his face and would not let me get in and just stood there behind the desk reciting all types of bogus information and what not. I asked for the managers direct line so I could speak to that person as he was not there at the time I believe his name was Eric who is a very nice young man and very accommodating to me when I first joined up him and the other fellow i forget his name but they were great guys. But this Brendan fellow just seemed to throw a fit and actually began to yell at me. Another member tried to come in and he basically almost didn't let her in as well and she had everything current including her membership dues etc he just felt like reciting some jargon to her for almost 5minutes and I could tell she was getting visibly upset and I had my buddy as a witness to this all and him and his family are all members and he just couldn't believe it either and we both just looked at each other like "is this guy for real right now???" Finally after letting her get in a few words he finally said ok yeah you can go you are fine for no reason he stopped her and she had the necessary info, number, check-in protocol etc. honestly did not seem like she wanted to even speak to him he forced himself on to her and started up the conversation and acted as an antagonizer the whole time just like he was with me. Again I asked for managers number he gave me some card with no manager number than said oh ok ok sorry and than goes and gets book and pretends to dial manager number and I can clearly hear the ring tone still going he literally didn't even attempt to call the manger. Finally after the 4th or 5th time of asking him to dial the manager he dials some number and just says sorry no he's not picking up there's nothing I can do sorry. Ok thanks . So I'm like well I've driven down like 45min to get here. and I'm not going to drive back another 45min for nothing so how can I get in?? So he says I have to pay this absorbent $20.00 dollar fee when it's literally midnight there is no one on the basketball court but me and my buddy and I'm just like ok fine I'll pay the fee. The guy was rude obnoxious and I just felt so belittled and looked down on and he just had this sly grin my buddy kept telling me what's his problem why is he being so rude to you why is he grinning at you like that what's his problem? The guy yelled at me and laughed at me when I tried to explain my situation. I tried to give him another card but he wanted me to pay some crazy amount of money and well my schedule only allows me to really be free at night and I'm still waiting for my cards to come in the mail and for all my accounts to be unfrozen. All I can say is steer clear of Branden folks.< /text>

<Text>Rarely do I write a review, but when the entire shower/locker room reeks of the pungent smell of mold, that is my cue.  As many other users have commented, this place is relatively new and management has let the place go.  The condition of the equipment is also sub-par.  Unfortunately use of this gym is by default.< /Text><Rate>2</Rate><Date>1440188658848<//Date>< Name>

Don’t judge a book by it’s cover! The place is shady but the food is delicious. Ordered egg rolls, chicken fried rice, orange chicken, broccoli beef and the house chow mien. It was all cooked to order so there was a little wait. It’s best to call ahead as there wasn’t any inside access only drive thru.<//text>

They offer most plates non spicy, mild, or spicy. Several chicken, beef, vegetarian, and seafood choices. It doesn't look like much from the outside but definitely food worth eating with great service and very affordable prices. They also offer great lunch specials and family sized portions.</review></record>

Food was great.

The place looks sketchy outside but inside its pretty cozy. And food is like home made, traditional chinese.

All in all, everything is great. Less 1 star for the way the owner took our order.<//text>

<Text>I love this place! It's so cozy and the owner is very nice, normally I know what I want but thanks to them I got spicy rice(never knew I ckuld do that). There is a clock (not sure if it is a grandmother or grandfather) thats beautiful. I regret doing a to-go order because there was so much artwork and beautiful plants to look at. Definately will come back here!<//Text>< pics>

I highly recommend Fortune Bowl looking to eat eat healthy Chinese food.
All the chicken is chicken bread unless otherwise stated. Walnut shrimp is to dye for, and the plate is balanced out with lettuce on the bottom. Vegetables taste fresh. None of the food is gunky greasy like many other Chinese food places.
Service is impecable. The man working makes it feel like a home vibe. Food is out in a timely manner.
Over all I would recommend highly recommend Fortune Bowl over any other Chinese food restaurant. The food here is better than Panda Express.</text>

Fortune Bowl has consistently delivered it's fresh, crispy, hot, spicy, deliciousness  whether it be dining in or take out. When Chinese is on the menu at our place, I know who's doing the cooking. Next time you get a hankering for some good Chinese food, deny your taste buds no longer and let Fortune Bowl do the cooking for you... I'm pretty sure you'll have a new,...go to...</review>

< Review>
cant believe this owner/cook.

I have been coming here for 2 years.
I come regularly couple times a month.
I ordered togo and when I got my steam rice was super crunchy. So when I came in for lunch I mention it to him my wife had to make rice and warm up our entrees. He stayed quite and gave me a dirty look. I was like whatever and left. I came to eat with a couple of co-worker. He saw me and this !@#$ added a bunch of salt to my entree. I wanted to go leave on the bill but I was with my coworkers.

LAST TIME I EAT HERE!

Mandarin Kitchen on Torrance Blvd is way better beef quality is way better. try it<//Review>

My friend and I eat here a lot and the food is always fresh and hot. It's only a one man cook, but he gets your orders done fast and right every time. I recommend Fortune Bowl 100%!< /Review>

<Review>I love this place for their lunch specials. Food is great and the owner/cook is a character. Don't expect a classy place and you won't be disappointed. Maricela's (my partner) favorite is the chicken chow mein. I love their Kung Pao Shrimp. Food is made on the spot. Not sitting on hot trays.</Review>< Time>

My son took his phone here about a month ago, still no phone or refund. They took his money and said his phone would be ready the next day, the next day no one was in the shop,,   calls and text are unanswered.  They told him they had to order a part , this story went on for  weeks they had a new story every week it's been about month. Still, no phone,no service  no answer.  How long do they expect him to wait. This is so unfair. This a  a Disservice!! I am writing this so you can be aware, i don't wanna see this happened to anyone else. In these times, we just  can't do nothing.  Please don't go there. This is Bad Business. ...It's a Blessing to be a Blessing.<//Review>

Yesterday we stepped into this place to seek some cell phone accessories. Even for a tiny part, Ali (the guy's name) helped us to find it in great effort.  His reliability and sense of responsibility to a single customer is greatly appreciated and respectful!<//Text>

This is the place to go if you want professional reliable phone repairs for a reasonable price, just make sure you go to the CORRECT store! I called and spoke with Ali and received a quote to repair my phone and when I thought arrived I went into a little store with a guy who sounded different but claimed to be Ali so I went along with it and when I confirmed the price the man gave me a completely higher price and couldn't guarantee it was fixable.
I went to my car and called back the original number where I spoke to Ali and realized this man was lying to me about who he was and just wanted my money.
Long story short, I wound up getting the correct address from the REAL Ali and it was right around the corner from where I accidentally went. The correct wireless plus is in the O'Rileys parking lot! I am so glad I double checked,You will not be disappointed by his work. Thank you again!< /Review>

This place is a scam!!! I went here to get my sons phone fixed for his birthday and 28 days later they still have NOT fixed the phone and refused to give us a refund. We've heard lies and stories day after day, week after week and no results. The guy who works in the shop is a sociopath and liar. And the owner is unprofessional and unreachable. This has been the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. Please save yourself the time, pain and HEARTACHE AND GO SOMEWHERE with Accountable Professionals like Staples or Best Buy.
I wish I would have NEVER stepped foot in there door with my sons phone.< /Review>

I had a problem with my Galaxy S4 power button.  They told me it would cost $40.00 for trouble shooting.  If the problem was simple, then the cost would be $40.00.  If the power switch needed to be replaced by soldering, then it would cost $90.00.  However, the $40.00 troubleshoot charge would count towards the repair.  I dropped the phone off at about 7:00 PM.  He had it repaired in less than an hour.  Just needed to replace the outer button.  I only had to pay the $40.00.  Definitely a great deal, either way, considering I don't have tools or the know how to fix such tiny parts, nor do I have new parts.
My power button work like new.  Further, I can not see where they went into repair it.  Not a scratch on it.

I definitely recommend using this place to repair an Android Galaxy Phone.  I will go to them first for future issues with any of my family's phones.<//Review>

I came to this store because I had purchased a used phone from Craigslist that had screen sensitivity problems. Ali took a look and quickly identified the problems, and explained everything to me as he worked. He is an honest guy with many years of experience. Ali was able to fix my phone issues and now my touch sensitivity is fixed. I will come back here if I need other repairs or to buy another phone.< /Text>

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!
This place is a total scam. I spent over $200 to get my phone repaired. Been waiting for over a month and they still haven't got it back to me. They do not respond to phone calls and have SUPER bad customer service. Also every time I go into the store, there are ALWAYS people complaining about their service, either the store didn't finish repairing the phone or ruined their phones somehow.
DO yourself a favor and save your time and money. THEY ABSOLUTELY SUCKKKKK!!!</text>

The best mobile shop period. Good customer service fair prices and best service. Call them u wont be disappointed. They was recomanded by a friend but what made me chose there service was how detailed and how much confidence he had explaining what had to be done to get it fixed and best part I did not have to leave my phone with them for 1 day or even few hours. The technition fixed it in 25 min while we had a nice talk about cars. Thank you< /Text>

Went here to get my iPhone 6 plus screen replaced since there was a small crack.

Cost was $320 for parts and labor

Timeframe was 3 weeks

I was given back a phone with the screen half glued on and dried glue on the corner of the LCD which is clearly visible.

And to top it off, they ripped the touch ID ribbon cable from the original home button while removing the screen and now my phone will never have touch ID again since they are married to the motherboard that they came with from factory.

You have been warned</text>

The people working here are good and helpful. However the repair parts are really not good quality. And I had the new screen swapped out the very next moment.< /text>

Bashir is unbelievable!      He is professional, extremely competent,
courteous and pleasant.     I went to him hoping to transfer data to my new cell, since I messed up the port of my old phone.      He not only fixed the problem, but also help sell my old phone!        Something is wrong on Google review with an verage of only 3.3.     If I can give a 10, I will!</text>

<Text>I got ROBBED!!! I went here to have my screen replaced and took my phone and money and a MONTH later got no results back in return.
I would give 0 stars if Google allowed.
The guy in the shop Ali is hot tempered and out of control. They can't be trusted.
Now I'll have to go to court to get this resolved.< /Text><resp>None<//resp><Rate>1< /Rate><Name>Chris Jones< /Name>< date>

Left my phone for repair 2 weeks ago... they said it would be done in 5 days but they don't know what is happening. The employees don't even know where phone is so they said they think its with the manager. Poor service.  UPDATE: I called them about my phone again (been 3 weeks now) and said that he would call back in 10 min with an update. Its been 3 HOURS NOW, AND THESE IDIOTS HAVEN'T CALLED BACK AND AREN'T ANSWERING THEIR PHONES. DON'T EVER GO HERE TO THESE LAZY, LYING BASTARDS.< /review>

Got a bad vibe from the man working there, didnt trust leaving my phone there.  I arrived 45 mins after they opened to find a note on the door saying be right back, waited for 40 mins when a guy came and squatted outside and lite up a cigarette. I tried calling their phone number and no one answered, waited another 5 mins then a young lady walked up and the guy stood up and unlocked the door.  I listened to their transaction and things just didnt seem right.  When he got to me he was very abrupt so I left without getting my phone worked on< /Review>

Called about having the display in my ipad mini replaced because 1/3 of the screen went black. Was told $99 and 1:00 to 1:20 to fix. Went in on my lunch and he changed it to $149 and said it would be 3 hours because his guy didn't show up at work. I said no thanks and he asked what I wanted to pay and I said $99, like I was told. He said the best he could do was $135.

Will never go back or recommend. Too bad CPR in Fremont closed, they were excellent.</Review>

< Review>
I had my Samsung laptop broken when I dropped it to the ground. The screen crashed on the left side. I brought it to Wireless Plus. Owner Bashir told me it could be fixed but the screen had to be ordered. Due to the shortage of the part global wise, he kept trying for many places. Finally the part arrived and the screen was replaced. It is like brand new laptop. He also discounted 10% for me because of the wait time. In the mean time he fixed the battery holding house for me. I definitely highly recommend to have cell phone and laptop to be repaired over there.<//Review>

<Date>1501257106956</Date><rating>1</rating><Review>Had my Samsung Galaxy S7 repaired here, the workmanship is horrendous. The screen is not glued down, they use double sided tape, which makes the phone much thicker than original and no longer fit in some cases. It was so obvious even the receptionist (not the technician) acknowledged it. Few days after the repair, I dropped the phone from my knee (less than 2 feet) and the screen goes blank, the phone was in a high quality thick Speck case. Upon close inspection, you can see the glass is separating from the phone but the LCD was still attached, which rips the LCD, see pictures. I call the owner to complain but he won't take responsibility.

Also, initially when I called them to confirm if they have a Samsung S7 screen in stock to fix my phone. The guy answering the phone said they do, but when I went to the store, they had to order it and it took a week. That's another point off.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>This was an *amazing* experience!!  This afternoon, my Galaxy S4 decided not to recognize the USB connector any more, and would not charge.  So after work, I stopped by our local MetroPCS office to see what my options were, and was pleased that they were still open at 7:30PM, but less pleased that they don't handle phone repairs at all...

However, the rep there pointed me to Wireless Plus; I called them, he said "bring it in, and I'll look at it".  So I did... he accepted it at 8PM, and said "yeah, give me about 90 minutes, I'll have it fixed."  (!!!!)  Not "I'll have it back in a couple of weeks", but "I'll do it now" !!!  Absolutely amazing... and he did... it connects to the USB line and charger, both in my car and in the house!  $80 for a last-minute "please help??", and it was done *now*...

If you're near Fremont, and ever need a mobile-phone repair, *do not* lose this number!!!</text>< Response>

I called to find out if the Technicians at Wireless Plus could repair the glass on a Nokia phone running Windows.  The answer was yes they could.  No one else would even discuss the possibility with me.  That includes Radio Shack and AT&T; they said they had no trained to do the job.

When the part came in it took Ali about 75 minutes to take the phone apart and install the new glass and the attached digitizer.  The phone worked when it was tested to being closed up.  When it was finally closed there were a couple of minor hiccups with speed and freezing.  Ali worked those bugs out very quickly; AND ALL OF MY DATA WAS ON THE PHONE WHEN I GOT IT BACK!!

I was impressed by the work done and the fact that Ali was able to do this by applying his existing knowledge of cell phone repair.

My son is going to take his HTC 1 to have his data rescued after the charging circuit failed and he was unable to get his phone back on.  He was told that HTC could do the job but his data would be lost.

Thank you to everyone at Wireless Plus.<//Review>

Discovered this recently from an article online and decided to try it, mainly for the atmosphere. The environment is unique, a bit of an adventure getting to, and exactly what I hoped for. From the East Bay side, I took the last exit before the Carquinez bridge onto Stenmark drive, a two lane road which soon becomes one lane, requiring attention. The GPS advised that a portion of the road is unpaved, which is misleading: only the parking lot at the very end is packed dirt, close to the water.
The small marina has nice looking houseboats, and very interesting sculptures with clever lighting powered by small solar panels, which would make a night visit rather interesting if it were possible.
We got to Black Star Pirate BBQ early-ish, at 10:30 am on a Friday, half an hour before they opened. There already was a line of about ten people or so.
We tried four cuts of meat, and four sides, which came to about $95 before tip. Beef briskets (my favorite) rotisserie lamb (a new favorite), pulled chicken and pork. All of it served warm and with a light drizzle of BBQ sauce. The leftovers lasted us almost three days. The service is prompt and helpful and completely unpretentious.
Sitting at a table a little further out from the outdoor patio, we listened to chatter and water lapping at the rocks below. This is a calm atmosphere with caveats. I'd read reviews complaining of how loud the music was, and I can imagine that if they have live music, it could be. On the other hand, music can also be a good distraction from the popping sound of gunfire from the range over the hill. That sound, while not loud, might be unsettling to some. But it's not an ordinary place: out of the way, on the water, with nature and those odd art works, and people who care about their place, the quality of the food and customers. As said above, being this close to the water is a calming experience. The sounds from the range? Hey. It's Black Star Pirate BBQ, after all.
I would have loved this as a kid, and I loved remembering that. Of course, we'll go back. Early, on a weekday.</text>

< Review>
This is a fantastic BBQ restaurant. Lively greeter with great recommendations set us up with some great food. I had since lamb and pork ribs with sides and a beer. The view is amazing and the live music was the cherry on top of a great meal. We got there just in time too, as we were leaving there was a nice sized line out front that speaks for how good this place is. Drive slowly, the road out there is thin with blind corners.< /Review>

<review>I had no idea anything at all was out there let alone a nice BBQ joint.  Good beer and drink choices. I only had the pulled pork and it was quite good.  The potato salad was good but the beans were a little too firm for my tastes.  Recent news articles about this place has made it super popular.  Big parking lot is a bonus and there are places to walk about and maybe see the goats.  Live music is nice but it was a bit loud.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3owHmPQibOlSrsx29sqgAhUCQPHi92eE5E-h2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMx_mE4vRj6Ffu5kffk2zj2SNVm29gBpkYuaptH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjaenclXPlBFsh5Ah9kN3RCEuoD7uCnieCmEOt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtI6-TPtNC82mXOkaVVKqcHBA28nxsvrZkB_cO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5ZHdV64Dv94QyBTJhryzqsLnnQkvCqSoN5k0J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVNbhX0QIGbkPircYhreAVEpOHUKOKyywrQqg4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtOJXipgR_QugIpdwsXOuoMg5y8alg7DmpyF-F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ9W5xzv60uMXmLeHg2Jo3FH3VFg7npuIMCLOQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBZZsRIGuUiYm_PRRv9IF_HbCW_c2JJGz9tJvp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo0uuy2mTz1GiqepgbeankMLfRIonbi72NiymR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvA4Zh4wgNmjh82PrOiEeYp1CMT3n09QGN8XVr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUTVAQslpAiKJCneiW5ncbjfJZJkATWak1vjqH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBr9rjnG84NskveJERP6xTnDl-_MJsmLm1vkVF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Went on a Saturday and what a great vibe! Live band, dining on the water, the smell of meat in the smoker and all the neat deco. You know you're in for something good by that line out front. Hubby and I shared a 4 meat, 4 side meal. Everything was really good. We really enjoyed all the meats and all the sides and so did our friends who also got a 4 meat meal to share. Both of us had 2 containers to enjoy tomorrow. Large portions so come hungry!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I enjoy the outdoor dining.  Food was tasty.  They ran out of ribs, but the beef tips and smoke turkey was good and the beans were delicious.  I'm going back again, there pet friendly and the views are  amazing.  1 Of Richmonds hidden jewels<//Review>< pictures>

Beautiful location and drive out there; felt secluded but really it's not far away. The establishment is so cute, service was very prompt and friendly (you order on arrival and they bring the food out super quick), and the food was so delicious! The pulled pork and ribs were both moist and delicious and the dry rub on the ribs in particular was well-flavored. All the sides were tasty but I especially liked the cabbage, greens (grown on site!), and slaw. The woman who took our order told us that she came out there once and ended up working there she liked it so much, which I loved and really says it all :) Came here for dinner on the way back from a hike in Marin, and it was a great treat after the exercise. I will definitely be back!<//Text>

Good BBQ with generous portions. The sauce isn’t too sweet-more to my liking. Be prepared for a line to order and for the kitchen to be back-logged. Enjoy the bohemian vibe while noshing on the vittles.</review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Although it's a bit out-of-the-way, Black Star is worth the effort. Driving along the Bay and descending to the cozy harbor is a mini vacation.
The setting on the marina with lots of outdoor seating is lovely.
The food is really good, with vegetarian and vegan options.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlK633O4jBHLxNtiHVMA5Gwkv62jenDwMs4Ja8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2-rWFeIPBVXtgcCbjZmH8ie5wGNOTrggGilrE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSqXanUIvQuf77yjOIUuFM244t0Bl7pcxuDWnQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6t2ZXq6ESUg6Q7MduQJUn6kBrPmP9-rvMokE0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKNc8xzfxNurNwCMESyk0RH5veFhAmnXHDsfi-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX897F9-ft9HUvHQy1zsQFt6YIO0Wcb9n_uvZ7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcaHyE-dSRSbbUcTZdVFaaNJx9tcbmty9ryzMU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcdTuevN49A_A-Uwcn0bzChmskTVN3rT53T5XX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

It sounded like an interesting story and a way to see a different part of the Bay area.

The experience was a great disappointment. The drive was OK, but the moment you get there you're charged $5 just to park your car in the dirt parking lot.It was a Saturday and the place seemed very busy. Disorganized might be another apt term.Once you had paid your bill, you had to find your own table, And since the COVID shutdowns are just starting to be relieved you still want to have some distance.

When we got there the band was playing abusively loud. This continued without stop for at least the next 40 minutes.That 40 minutes was taken up with not having our food arrive. After finally getting a table, and sitting there for a while, the food arrived. We had ordered the ribs and tri- tip. Hope was that the food would make up for the so far disorganized experience. Unfortunately that was not the case. The ribs were served cold, tough, and tasted like underdone rib jerky. The tri-tip  Was fair but that was the end of the good part. The side dishes were overcooked, tasteless, and the biscuit that arrived with the food was like warm cement. The cornbread was just OK.

All in all then an experience I would not repeat.The disorganized service such as it was ,  the abusive music, and finally the abusive food made this place a no go.This was our experience and probably some people have given this place a good review. If it were possible I would give it a -2 stars.</text></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful hidden gem for wonderful food and awesome atmosphere. Lots of fun interesting sculptures to enjoy around the area and a dorm with goats and chickens. Suzi the owner goes around to everyone and is a joy to talk with making you feel very welcomed and at home.< /Review>

I love everything about Black Star Pirate BBQ- the food, the seaside setting, the local art sculptures, the nearby goat farm (!!), the customers (one devoted patron pulled up into the dock right before closing time, knocked back some bbq, then hopped back on his boat and sailed into the sunset!!! That’s dedication!) excited to see live music there soon on another sunny day ❤️</text>

Excellent food, customer service and great ambiance. Family friendly but a little pricey. The tri tip was a little tough and the cut too thick.
My husband and i had pulled chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, ribs, mac and cheese, beans, jalapeno cornbread, tater tots and sauteed greens. Everything was really  really good. And the customer service was excellent. Authentic and fresh. Oh and they run out of meats, sides and dessert, so go early.</text>

Really? Five STARS? I must have caught the bad day if you are someone who knows what barbecue is supposed to taste like then you wouldn’t go here the food was overpriced bland what makes this place great is the atmosphere not the food really they just be a bar because that was food was cold and tasted like Costco not happy with the food. The atmosphere is FIVE stars but don’t spend on that food.<//review>

Awesome place! Beautiful, gorgeous scenery, very date-friendly! SUPER nice & generous people! And the food?
Tender.
Juicy.
Flavorful.
And just the right amount of spices
(NOT like the kind of place that uses spices to compensate for weak meat quality).

This joint is an absolutely amazing little crown's gem in a Pirate's Treasure Chest!
Truly, one of a kind.<//text>

<Text>Wasted an hour for the "so so" bbq. Sorry, it's not worth $60 for lunch. I had a better bbq. The only three dishes worth mentioning are "sweet potato, saute mushrooms and a bottle of rose lemonade". The tri-tip was tough, the ribs were okay and the links were alright. The store-bought bbq sauce was not that flavorful (Paul Newman's bbq sauce tastes better and that is not a compliment). The only good thing was the location and the service.< /Text>< Pictures>

It's a good barbecue place in a pretty location that's out of the way. But is it worth a 2+ hour wait because of that article you read? Not at all.

Your local barbecue joints in the city are just as good if not better. Portion sizes were smaller than expected. Sides were very good though. Prices are reasonable. But we literally waited over 2hrs cuz a friend bought into the hype and the drive out there makes you not to go back with nothing. Stay or skip? If there's no line, sure it's a great time and I'd come back again. But if you have to wait any longer than 45+ mins, just find another place.<//review>

Atmosphere is great. Workers are very nice and friendly. The lady who took our order was very cool and offered her recommendations.

We must have come on an off day because the food was just so-so. Ordered the 2 meats and 3 side plate.

Tried the tri tip and the ribs. The tri tip was chewy, without much marbleization taste, and some pieces were surprisingly rare. The tri tip tasted like a lesser grade cut. Not sure what happened because our tri tip didn't look like some of the photos shared on Google Maps and Yelp. The ribs were okay but tough. We were given three St. Louis cut ribs.

Sides were: Mac and cheese, braised cabbage, and sweet potato. All okay. Mac and cheese could have used more cheesey goodness. Sweet potatoes could have had more sweetness.

Overall, would consider coming back and giving it another try because the surrounding area and the view was great 👍.</review>< pictures>

It is worth the drive. Set aside some time and come here for food and nature. Bring the kids. Bring the dogs. It is beautiful.

The owner Tony and his staff are wonderful.  I recommend the ribs and all the sides. I sampled each entree and the food is delicious.

Restaurants like this are hard to find. I cannot speak highly enough about the atmosphere of this location. I want to live there.<//review>

Funky place with great food. They ran out of lamb. The plastic selverwhare didn't hold up to the food....broke instead of cut.<//Text>

Meh.. One dimensional barbeque. Sauce is not interesting. Smoke rings on meat are good. Prices are not posted. $5.00 parking fee (that is new). We had two meats (brisket and pulled chicken) slaw, mushrooms and onions and grits that we split. Grits were not hot and no butter!!! I got side of fries($8.00). Three sodas. Got the bill, no prices just a total. $73.00!!! Splitting one plate!!  I can fill much better on my kamado joe

I'!! spend a lot for good food, but not this much for mediocrity.  Won't be going back.<//Text>

<review>Magic! More than a meal, but also food for the soul! Xydeco band playing very dance-able music - clearly so because the patrons were definitely on their feet! That's not to say the BBQ isn't amazing,  cuz cos', I tellin you, man,  gotta try this!< /review>< Rating>

We live here in the blue houseboat with the wave and are so grateful to the Black Star. Don't forget they have the best beer too. East Brothers Light House Beer on tap is almost too good but is fits the menu perfectly as do Tony and Suzi.. Enjoy!< /Review>

So delicious!!! With live music and dinosaur! A mini excursion, without even crossing a bridge! Great service too. We had the 4 meats/4 sides combo, fed 2 hungry people with no leftovers. Fave was fish, and sweet potatoes mixed with the collards. (Dog & kid & veg friendly too.) Lots of space between tables and everybody wearing masks except when eating< /Review>

Plus, they’ve got an incredible view of the harbor.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>Unfortunately I think that they are going through some growing pains after the recent positive review in the SF Gate and the ease up on Covid-19 restrictions. Our first attempt was on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and after the drive out there we couldn't even find a parking spot. We went back the following Friday afternoon and even though the line was only back over the train tracks it still took 40 mins to get to the head of the line and order, which was easy because they only had four meats left. We ordered all four, pork ribs that were just OK, pulled pork and pulled chicken which were good and the smoked turkey that was the best of the four but not what I would have expected from a BBQ joint. The sides all needed salt, the corn bread was just a cold dence biscuit and they didn't even have greens available. $110.00 for a 4 by 4 and two beers.. I thought that the dinning area would be packed , but it wasn't.  I thought the kitchen must be backed up, it wasn't, our food came out right away. The best part of the whole experience was the beautiful surroundings. I'll give it one more chance in a few months to see if they can get their ship together.  Good luck, I'd like this place to survive.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80859db840ea3819:0xbfb0d8d00ba3e89a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We have been meaning to come here even back when they were still Nobilis.  I'm glad that they have reopened.  The place was packed when we got there.

We had the 2 meat (brisket and pork ribs) and 3 sides (mac & cheese, slaw and mushrooms).and the cajun shrimp. Everything on our plate was so good.<//review>

This is a destination bbq restaurant. Perfect for covid-19 era. Just don't expect it to be like other bbq joints. It's more like what you would expect from a waterfront restaurant - great views, good service, good food, full price.<//Review>

I don't speak Vietnamese, the ladies don't speak much English. However, there is one customer who kindly helped me out. I asked for vegetarian sandwich. It's $4. That's a lot. I could get one cheaper at Lee's Sandwich. The customer told me I could go to Ban Mi Che Cali for cheaper sandwich but this place is good.

The sandwich didn't taste like vegetarian at all. I couldn't tell what ingredients were in it. Judge for yourself, is it vegetarian?

I gave $5 to the lady. She walked away without giving me my change. I stood there waiting for her for 1 minute for the change.</text>

Rude. Raise the price because we doesn't want to take the togo food that she insisted to sell. We end up buy it with high price because it doesn't matter, but they deserve a true review for bad customer service.</Text>

Good fast foods for reasonable prices. Lots of choices for fast foods to go. Needs to do more to keep flies away from the foods.</review>

One of those frustrating CASH only business so the owners can hide income from the tax man while sporting ginormous rocks on their fingers! Food gets left out for who knows how long and usually ends up tasting spoiled by the time I get it home (roughly 15-20 min drive) if I pick up items on their counter. I saw cooks stick their finger into the food they were cooking to taste it, stick their finger into their mouths, adjust seasonings, stick it back into the food again for another taste, and immediately transfer the food into a tray to sell.  I guess their germs are a special ingredient! Their Vietnamese salads are kept in the fridge and are a "safer" thing to purchase. Prices are fair and the food is decent enough for take out, but I personally don't like carrying cash so I rarely go here unless someone requests food specifically from here. In most cases I try to sway them towards something else since this place is out of my way and I'm not a fan of places that are allergic to using a register and clearly only accepts CASH and rings people up verbally to avoid having an electronic and recorded money trail lol.<//review>

Like any other asian food stores all the usual items you find eslewhere is here.  I like it because its within the same plaza as Stater Bros. I bought myself some fried shrimp chips and some asian cookies.  They do sell party foods ready to go in a tin container for you to buy. Easy place to find. You might need to come early though if you're heading here or bring an extra friend when coming to this plaza because sometimes it takes awhile to find parking. You can just drop off someone to head inside to buy some food while waiting for a parking space.</Text>

<Review>I would give the place 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the mung bean slushy drink.  However,  the lack of order and difficulty finding parking really dropped their score.

Dang,  people don't know how to get in line here.  Either they do the slow crawl to cut in thinking that you're not aware,  or they just straight out raise their hand to get the cashier's attention and cut in front of the line. Seriously,  how long do you have to be in America to learn some f***'n manners! Rude,  rude,  rude!!!</Review>< pictures>

Went here to buy a coffee with condensed milk (ca phe sua da) and had to wait for a long time to order. There was nothing comparable to a line, and when it was my turn to order, a rude guy cut in front of me to order. The server saw that he cut but ignored the fact that he cut and took his order before mine. There are no number systems or lines of any kind, and people who work here are mindless and rude. I would never give this place my business ever again. Come here if you want to wait for a long time for your food because they don't have a line system, also come here if you want to be treated with no respect. Don't come here if you value your time and don't want to unnecessarily waste it. I would give this place 0 STARS if that was an option.<//text>

I was excited to try their bun bo hue since this place was highly recommended by one of Vietnamese friend. It turns out I didn't like their bun bo hue as much as I enjoyed the ones from Ng Binh. This broth didn't have the same intensity of deep flavors.</text>

<Review>I have been in this store 3 to 4 times and every time I have been in there, I have received excellent customer service! One visit I had to purchase a bicycle air pump to fit a special valve. After selecting the pump, the employee at the register showed me an adapter that cost about one dollar.  He could've easily let me purchase the air pump and said nothing. Honest people!< /Review>< pics>

Been a customer with Performance Bicycle for years and sorry to see them closing. I certainly wish employees all the best, and may they find even better jobs with better pay. Persons responsible for the company's downfall should not be awarded golden parachutes, but we know how that system works, don't we?< /text>

It looks to me that some of the employees are stealing the merchandise. Liquidators should speed up the process so that customers could get a good deal. Bring it down fast to 80% then 90% in a week before the employees  have time to steal from already bankrupt company. An employee asked me to leave when I noticed something fishy.< /Text>

They charged me $30 rotate my tires, which, come to find out is a pretty astronomical price.  It took them about 6 minutes to switch the front with the rear and vice versa (which was awesome).  When I commented to the guy at the register at how high the price was if you looked at it as an hourly rate, he said well, if you tried to do it, it might take you half an hour to do each tire.  I didn't know people are now charging you for how long it would take you if you did the work yourself.  On top of that, I saw the price list they scan for labor.  The code they scanned clearly had the price as $9.99.  Since it was two tires, I could understand $20, but the guy manually changed it to $30.  Even at $20, that's a pretty high price to pay.  Do yourself a favor and go to Sports Chalet (literally a hundred yards away) and ask for David. He can rotate them for $5-$10.  Unfortunately, I found this out after I got swindled.
I assume this place is best for major problems or super expensive bikes/problems. Others should try searching elsewhere.<//review>

<Text>Jason and his team go out of their way to deliver nothing but the best in customer service. The work Jason did on my Fuji last Saturday was very impressive. He dropped everything to fix my bike on a busy Saturday. I had issues with the chain skipping and shifting. He replaced the cables, cleaned chain, shortened the chain, adjusted front and rear derailleurs and bike was running like new again. He also charged me a very fair price for all the work he did. All the mechanics there are very professional and go the extra mile to take care of customers. Thank you guys.<//Text>< pics>

Came in here as a plan B, but the whole experience was top notch. I needed to get a few things on my bike adjusted as well as buy a lock and tools. The mechanics were awesome, and I will definitely be coming back here the next time I need something bike related.< /Text>

Overpriced! Poor customer service!  Poor service in general.   I have gone to performance bicycle quite a few times now because it is the only bike shop close to my house. Every single time I have left their shop I have left furious .   They do not keep parts in stock, have extremely rude employees, charge way too much, and are not helpful in the least bit. I  have Resorted to walking an extra 2 miles to a bike shop across Town because I refuse to give them my service again.<//Review>

<Review>**Update**
After speaking with the manager, the multiple issues were resolved. He was very helpful and understanding.
**Old Post**
Got a rear flat fix and a new chain. 5 miles later rear tire went flat. Upon inspection of the rear wheel I noticed that the chain I had just purchased was way to tight. Unrelated to the flat obviously but a huge deal on a single speed bike. When I reached out to see if they would correct the issues I was met with an unfriendly no and a smirk. I paid $30 dollars in labor for a flat fix and change replacement, not including parts, I would say that's more than a little high for a place that doesn't stand behind their service.

-overpriced
-unfriendly
-poor maintenance

/tube $4.99

The kind of place where you get to know the employees and they get to know you. Also whenever I had issues with my bicycle not only would they get to fixing it right away but they would explain to me what happened and how they are going to fix it. Fantastic place<//Text>

<review>Performance Bike has a sale every week.  If the item you want isn't on sale that week, wait, it will likely go on sale in the next few weeks.  It is worth signing up for their online email lists.  They provide additional discounts (15%-20% off coupons on various items or for any purchase - including bikes).
This store, located in the Vons/Sport Chalet shopping center is one of the bigger stores.  The guys that work there (I say guys because I've never seen a woman working in this store) are very nice and generally helpful.  Most will give you the company line and if you press them, they will go off script and tell you what they personally think about items.
Prices for most stuff here is very competitive, but is hard to beat when on sale - which is nearly all the time.
If you buy accessories for your bike, they install them free.  If you need basic stuff, they will likely do it on the spot, and may or may not charge you depending on the complexity of the repair.
Very satisfied with Performance Bike in San Diego on Midway Drive.</review>< Date>

Yes it is a chain, but the people working there make it what it is, which is a solid "neighborhood" bike shop.  Always some sort of sale going on (it is a chain) and if asked they will always match their own on-line/Nashbar prices.  For that matter they will also price match other retailers. I also purchased their service package.  I have a mountain bike, which I bought from a different chain store, but the Performance service package is a value for me.< /text>

<Text>Ok...just like the rest of low reviewers....same experience. But, I had even the worst...experience ever.
They ask if you need help...over and over....
And when you finally ask for help...
They are "Not Knowledgeable."
Prices marked on the shelf were missing.
It is a good thing, I had my old part with me. The sales clerk, could not and did not have the knowledge to find and match up the right parts.
The stores prices are so inflated.....seems like they try and make you feel good by offering 20% discount; but, that still does not put the prices where they should be....
The bicycle mechanic has an attitude and acts like he does not want to help.
And oh guess what...??? The day I visited...
The computer was down...meaning they had to run my card the old fashion way....
What a time consuming mess.
They did not know how to do it.
That was my sign, I should have left and not given them my business.
Plus, it took forever and they....the mechanic and the sales clerk kept making errors.
Plus, I had to ask for a receipt. Because, the sales clerk did not want to do the right thing...nor did She know how to do the right thing.
Well, come to find out.....
They double billed me...
Charged me the same amount twice.
Had to call them back and ask why???
All they wanted to do is brush me off and said the person who can help me is busy with another customer...
Ok, no problem....
I will hold; because, I need the charge reversed ASAP.
Since I was double billed/charged twice and said they will take care of it later....in the day....and gave me the complete run around.
Excuse me....No way....
When asked why I was double billed???
They said they got the stacks of reciepts mixed up and ran them twice. Well, I am still waiting for the second charge to drop off my bank account.
Will keep you posted.....
I will be on there door step in person brite and early in the morning.
If the charges are not reversed...< /Text>< user_name>

<Text>I was ambushed when i walked in. Let me at least get more than 2 feet in the door before u attack me with questions. With in 3 mins of turning down the first person i was questioned again. At this point you should have made first contact. Not twice in less than 5 mins. When i did finally make a request was told they don't accommodate customers at this location and where else i could go. For such an aggressive approach u would imagine they be willing to do much for sale, but no. With that i took my business elsewhere. I do not recommend going to this location.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

<Time>1510755676643< /Time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>Horrible service. I moved here from Dallas, TX and bought a Fuji Roubaix there years ago...put over 15k miles and stopped cycling for years. Getting into it now and chose another Fuji. Bought it here. I will say that service here in CA is horrible compared to Dallas.  When I bought my other bike I was fitted - yes, on the trainer and adjusted until I was good. Here, I think they just wanted my cash and out the door.  No fitting. Nothing. And they have the sales guys doing everything - tires pressure, adjusting the bike, assembling shoes, etc.  Meanwhile, the mechanic in the back doesn't want to be bothered. Ummm, if I'm spending almost $2k with everything, do you think a mechanic could fully adjust my bike?!?

And less than a week on my bike I got a flat...no problem, I bought tubes and CO2 cartridge - well, guess what, CO2 didn't work. Took my almost 45 mins to get it to squeeze out enough to get home.

Next day, I rode to Adams Avenue Bicycles which is close to my work and bought new tires, new tubes and all new CO2 device and cartridges....threw all the stuff from Performance out.

In Dallas, I bought most of my things at Performance - they gave good advice and took care of customers.  Here, I guess the mechanic just wants to do repairs and assemble bikes...no concern for someone in there spending money on a new bike.

I won't go into Performance ever...not one in CA anyways. Absolutely horrible service.  I'll use my local shop for all future purchases.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Extremely pushy Hispanic sales woman wearing clothes two sizes too small followed us around both visits and was very nasty to us. Talked over us so many times and would not leave us alone even when asked. It was obvious she only cared about getting as much money out of us as possible. Pushy, rude, belligerent, and honestly doesn't seem to know much about bicycles except what's on the tag. I was very close to buying a Diamondback Apex right after a test run, but her attitude and the way she kept pushing the more expensive bikes gave me a very nasty feeling about the whole affair. I walked out right before I would have bought it and concluded my shopping at the shop in La Mesa - much better customer service, more knowledgeable staff, and they don't try to talk down to you because you don't want to buy an $800 bicycle. I refuse to let an employee try to take advantage of me and bully me into buying something more and more expensive. This store has lost my business completely, and any business I have with Performance Bikes will be done through the La Mesa store, which deserves 5 stars.<//Text>< Pictures>

Went in for a question about a bottom bracket , and the sales person had no clue what's he was even looking at. I asked the service guy if he could take a look at it. Maybe it could be tightened and he said, "I'll have to charge for that" and didn't even tell me how much assuming that I wouldn't pay?? I don't know what is wrong with the people working at this bike shop, always so rude. I wanted to get my bike fixed and I was ready to spend the money for a new bb and the tech told me " I can't even do that until next Tuesday" something that would take 15 minutes!! I can believe it, then he said " your welcome" I mean come on, NEVER GOING BACK!!!!< /review>

I generally like this regional chain of bike shops, and this one is on the larger side, with a massive selection of clothes.  Unfortunately there's only one mirror in the back if you actually want to see what you look like in glowing neon before making a purchase.</Text>

<Text>Terry is the best! He made the process of setting up new phones and starting a phone plan soo easy and saved us a lot money. He literally did everything and went out of his way to find us all the deals he could. Definitely the best experience I've had at a phone store. Thank you Terry!< /Text>< pics>

I had a horrible experience!  Worst time and had the laziest sales rep EVER! He didn't put on the glass front I said I would buy only if he could install it for me a d didn't.  Never asked it I wanted my case on. Charged me more than what I wanted to buy but wouldn't listen when I said I didn't want it so felt forced to purchase. He never helped me at up my new phone or teach me how to even use it. Never looked me in the face nor tried to small talk with me . Was VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL!  destroyed my joy in buying a new phone!!HORRIBLE!</review>

I made an appointment and Salvo came out to help me.  I really appreciated his patience.  He was wonderful to work with.  He gave me phone contacts to call to complete my transaction.  In times like today, easy is important.
This experience was very easy and safe.  Thank you Salvo<//review>

I’m posting this review on behalf of a good friend and surgeon. He stopped by on April 9 around noon, he needed a new phone ASAP, and the sales representative that was there was very rude to him. He refused to assist him with a phone purchase or with transfer of his contacts. He told him “you should learn.” My friend told the sales rep “ I’m a doctor, I don’t know how to do that.” In times like these where our healthcare providers need to be reachable it’s embarrassing to think that there are people who hinder this from taking place. Needless to say, my friend who is older was very upset about it and in complete awe he left. I hope Verizon really reconsiders the image and neglect that their employee is providing to customers and essential workers/ first responders.< /Review>

<Review>Some time ago I wanted to switch from AT&T to verizon to switch to my wife's plan and start a family plan.  I showed up and was told to just go online to buy the phone/plan and set everything up.  So that was a waste of time.  Even before showing up, I realized my question may take a good chunk of time for an associate so I tried to call ahead but was put on hold for 20 minutes before I hung up.

In short:  Completely useless. Not sure why you have a store...</Review>< Pics>

I would give zero stars.  Not even sure why they are open; staff members stand outside the store and tell you they can only help you by giving you a phone number to call.  We needed phone service so we just dropped Verizon after 20 years and headed over to Sprint.</text>

This is a very shady location in terms of the sales people. Salesperson (Jared?) was not upfront about the cost even though we asked many questions. Now we paid $800 on our account to get a new device but we do not have a new device.

Be aware of the salespeople here who are pushy and will do anything (omit details) to make a sale.< /Review>

What is the point of having employees in the building if they don't do anything to help the customers. Went in here with a friend after she had attempted multiple times on the phone and in another store. The phone convo she had told her to go to the store in person. Then upon arrival at the store she was told to call customer service and ONLY if the phone customer service couldn't help  then he would help. When no progress was made on the phone we attempted to ask him for help. Before we even finished asking he interrupted and said "I already told her that she had to call"

Seriously no point in having a store where people can have face to face help.
Also witnessed a guy buying a new phone and he wanted help setting it up and the employee didn't seem receptive to helping, appeared more concerned with the next possible sale.

Last time I'll be coming here or recommending services at this location.
I'll be going across the street to best buy.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We waited for an hour and then were told we couldn’t get the phone on a business account because we weren’t authorized to get one. This was incorrect and Verizon overnighted us a phone apologizing for the mistake. the worker was just incompetent saying for security they couldn’t let us purchase the phone so if you’re looking to waste your time you can go to this store I would recommend it though.</review>

<review>I didn’t have a problem with the store but with a service rep. I went in to have someone look at my bill and help me reduce it. This guy “helping” me said he would give me a great discount on my bill but I needed to sign up for some things. I had the unlimited plan before it was brought back so I was paying a lot since I grandfathered into it so I went in to cancel it and drop down to a different plan. But thinking he was helping and lowering my bill I said ok to the things that were supposed to give me a discount. I am now paying $300 for 8 lines!!! Guess how many lines I actually use? 2!!!!!!! TWO lines! That’s it! I’m paying for all these extras and now I’m stuck on a two year contract. I called customer support and even they were shocked and disappointed someone would “help” me like that. I’ve had Verizon for years because of their service and their great customer service but after my contracts are up I’m done thanks to one “helpful” sales rep.<//review>< Response>

My wife's phone burned out it  is not even a year old and has insurance on it. When talking  with  a  store associate  I was told there was nothing  they could  do and that a phone could   be mailed to her but since she has a small nick in the corner that has to be fixed first. I am getting  ready  for military work ups. My wife is phoneless. Because the agent had no idea how much it would  cost. Then he tried to sale me another product for 200.00 so my wife would not be without a phone. when we had sprint and my wife lost her phone. We were taken care of they even  gave her a loaner phone. I have been with Verizon for years but after today I'm done.< /Review>

My disabled mother was turned away from this store before she made it all the way inside. Before they even knew what was wrong with her phone, she was told they couldn’t help her and to go to The Apple Store. Due to my mother being disabled and me living in another city, that wasn’t possible for her. I am beyond disappointed in the service she was met with and I definitely wouldn’t recommend this store or Verizon to anyone.< /review>

The best way to get done what you need, while getting answers to the questions that come up is going to an actual Verizon Corporate store, not one of those pointless mall kiosks. This location in Mission Valley has helped me out a few times. Corporate stores can do a lot more than a kiosk, but in reality, about the same calling customer service can accomplish. But, the swag here is excellent; cases, speakers, ear buds, all that fun stuff.< /Review>

<text>We switched back to Verizon from T-Mobile because we were told we could get free iPhone 11s. Unfortunately the man who helped us cared more about the sale then being honest and upfront. He didn’t tell us about the $40 per line activation fees including a iwatch that we were already on the fence about adding. He added some protect thing we didn’t ask for which added $50 a month and he didn’t tell us our first bill would be almost $400! When our monthly bill should only be $100. He told us we were good to go before our phones were activated which lead to them not working for 4 days and wouldn’t stop trying to sell us extra add ons. I tried to call both the store and the main Verizon number but never got ahold of anyone. Also he said he couldn’t add military discount there because we didn’t have the correct information. Come to find out he was lying again. We went to another corporate store and they said there’s no reason why he couldn’t have added it right then. He told us we could use the pre paid gift card to pay off our phones so we wouldn’t be paying monthly for our phones... turns out that’s a lie too! I was told from several other reps you have to leave a balance otherwise the monthly credits go away and the only way to pay off the phone early is to do it when you switch. Basically Richard lied to us about everything so he can get credit or whatever when he literally did the bare minimum. Not impressed being back with Verizon and missing T-Mobile!<//text>< Rate>

<Text>Only reason I went into the physical store to buy a phone was to be able to activate it on the spot. Salesperson said that was no longer necessary, turned out it was and I had to waste time with Verizon technical support instead of getting it done there. Guessing he didn't see me as valuable once the sale had been complete. Will never utilize this store again.</Text>< pics>

The worst customer service in San Diego.  Never go back here again. The manager is arrogant and has an attitude problem.   Don't support this location's bad management.< /Review>

<Text>The stars are for the employee who helped me with my phone issues: V.  Her patience and skill at asking the right questions, got my issue resolved.  Then, she adjusted my plan and dropped my monthly bill by another $20!
I know cell phone users have a love/hate relationship with Verizon, but to be transparent, I have had my cell phone with Verizon since 1997 or 1996. It's been so long, I can't remember.  I know they are costly.  But, I needed reliability and access to others when I go to the middle of nowhere. Once, in the middle of Montana hundreds of miles away from anything, my phone worked. I couldn't believe it. So, throughout the years I learned that if Verizon can't get me my call, no other phone company can.< /Text><Date>1544015978517<//Date><Name>Linda Farnan< /Name>< Response>

<text>They deserve 0 stars if that was an option. Greedy salespeople and managers, no concern for customer service or for the benefit of the customer. They were only willing to return a broken fit-bit ($100)  ONLY if I purchased another $350 watch at $66 a month and signed a new contract for another $10 a month service fees. (Cost to me $77 a month) All I wanted was to exchange my broken fit-bit. They tried to up-sell me on the $350 watch, offering a full refund on the broken fit-bit. When I declined the expensive watch, they refused to return or even exchange the broken one!! So lame! I'll never waste my time in this greedy, self serving verizon store. Shame on you!

I guess he only wanted to hook himself up on his own commissions!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The person who helped me didn't give me the right phone that I purchased, then I didn't get the shipping label to return my old phone, and they also didn't give me the box for my screen protector to register it to get a new one. So yeah I'm pretty upset about my whole experience. I feel like I should have just ordered a new phone online and did it all myself.</review>

Came to this store to upgrade my wife phone and I was immediate greeted by Jorge.  He took care of me and did not tried to get me off my Unlimited Data Plan like other CS.  The process have taken less than 15 min and I was out the door.  This is the fastest phone purchase ever and with great service!!!  Kiddos to Jorge!!!<//Review>

Everything on my phone looks like an xray so l went to the Verizon store in Mission Valley in San Diego. A nice young lady greeted me at the door and tried to help me but no luck. Then a male employee walked up was very short with me. I told him what was going on with my phone. He told me,"We don't do that here. You'll have to call Tech Coach, he hands me a card and walks away. The young lady that greeted me at the door looked at me then apologized.
What happened to customer service at Verizon?? I'm not happy and will not go back to that store. Sorry, l didn't get names. I went into the store about 11:30 am on January 5, 2018. I don't think this employee should be fired, he needs Customer Service training.  Jerry</Text>

This has always been my Verizon store of choice for 10 years. I've had both good experiences and not-so-good experiences. Overall, I would recommend this location. Ask for Jose. He hooked me up with a new phone right when I needed one, and he actually took the time to listen to my concerns.<//Text>

I would like to share my experience that I just had at this located with a slimy sales representative named Sandra Woody. I sent my daughter into this particular store because it's a corporate run office, not one of those shady retailers. My daughter was to only get a phone, nothing else. Sandra woody wouldn't let me daughter leave the store with a new phone unless she also purchased the Verizon 'hum' service. Woody told my daughter the service would be 'free' and that it came included with the phone. Even though my daughter told Woody numerous times that the service wasn't wanted or needed, she relented because of Woody's relentless push for my daughter to take this useless product home. I did not give any authorization for this product to be added to my account and daughter communicated that she only had permission to get a new phone. Turns out the 'free' service has a monthly $10 fee and there's a two year contract connected to the service, a service we didn't want or need. I went back to return the equipment, requested a manager immediately, I was initially told I would have to pay a 'restock' fee on the equipment. I didn't relent, I had them return this product which was pushed on my daughter in the slimiest of ways. I am disgusted at that con artist Sandra Woody and at Verizon for letting one of their sales representatives behave in such a shady and slimy manner. Beware of any 'free' services, they most certainly aren't free. Avoid Woody and make sure whatever you purchase doesn't come with any strings attached.</text>

Worst mobile cellular store I've ever been to and worst customer service. The first man that checked me in, Mike, said he would send me an email that was never sent. After coming back he became extremely rude.

I called the store and they didn't answer so customer service answered and tried to get me on the line with the manager, after 20 minutes of not answering I came back to the store where the manager, Chris, wanted to charge me $5 to print my bill. After asking him who his manager is or if there was a district manager, he said there was none.

This is the exact reason I left Verizon in the first place.< /Review>

<text>Really nice facility, very up to date and trendy. Staff was willing to help. Did not have any advice on a durable phone. I love my Droid Turbo 2, and wanted to get the equivalent in durability. Unfortunately now, everything in the store is glass. The best one they had available was moto z force. I broke my kyocera brigadier, but I also really liked that one as well (the only kyocera they had was a flip phone). I wanted to get a CAT S41, but they said it isn't available with the Verizon company. I may have to switch to AT&T if I don't want to have a broken phone.<//text><username>Jessi Edmunds< /username><Time>1537742111048<//Time>< gmapID>

<text>The rep misquoted my monthly payment during the "sales" phase, and then after he charged my card, he told me that he made a mistake and that my monthly change for my S8+ would be $35, not $25 which is why I agreed to get the phone.  The only option they offered was to reverse the transaction and refund my card, however it was too late to put me back on my old plan.  So after spending 2 hours in the store, I was pretty fatigued, so just decided to move forward at the higher price.  I would expect this type of bait and switch from AT&T or Sprint, but not Verizon.  I have been a loyal customer for over 10 years.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>I traded in my Galaxy S6 at this store for a "free" pixel on December 23rd of 2016. They lost my S6 and refused to honor the promotion. I spent a year trying to get them to honor it. I had to hunt down the IMEI number for the S6. They finally tracked it down, after talking to the store manager and three customer service supervisors, and it turns out that they sent it to the wrong place. One year later, they tell me after losing my phone and then finally finding it, that they cannot honor the deal Because it's expired. Worst company ever. Oh, and they own the FCC now. So goodbye internet.<//review><time>1512848784391<//time><user_name>Duke Jarboe< /user_name>< gmap_id>

Alo, their prices and promotions don't quite match up with the website. I pre-shopped online and went in to purchase, just to find out that it was a little more difficult to get exactly what I was offered online. They eventually did it, but the sales guy had to keep running with his little tablet to his boss to get him or her to do it. A little awkward and if I had known, I would have just done it online.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Until this recent visit, I hadn't stepped foot in a cell phone store in probably 4 years.  My last upgrade was 2 and a half years ago, and I did it over the phone and had them ship it to me because I HATE the borderline harassing sales people that seem to inundate the staff in these places. Unfortunately I got overly excited when visiting the Polar Bears at the Zoo the other day, and launched my phone 20 feet across the exhibit, which resulted in a broken charging port and a cracked screen, so I had to bear (haha) down and make a trip into the Verizon store.

I will admit, I was expecting the worst.  It was a Saturday afternoon, and the parking lot was packed.  I thought for sure it would be an hour until I was even helped, and then I was going to have to fend off hundreds of  attempts to sell me stuff that I didn't want or need.  Boy was I wrong!

I was greeted when I walked into the store by a friendly associate who took my name and phone number and let me know that someone would  be with me within 5 minutes.  2 minutes later I was greeted by Naseer.  He asked me what I wanted to accomplish, and he focused on just that.  One of my main concerns was the price of a new phone, and how it would effect my bill because they had changed their upgrade process since the last time I had upgraded.  He sat me down, and explained everything clearly about my billing, and how it would change with a new phone.  Nothing sales, just genuinely there to help.  He then asked if I had a new phone in mind.  I told him about the 2 I had been researching, and he didn't try to sell me on either one.  He let me guide the conversation, asked me what I liked about my current phone, and used those attributes to compare to the two new phones I was interested in.  I decided on a phone, and I was out of there within 40 min of when I walked in the door.  I was shocked in the best way possible by Nasser's professionalism, and genuine caring attitude.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>The customer service at this store was horrendous! There was a mistake on my bill and was told by Verizon customer service to go into the store to prove I actually tried to increase my data. When I brought the phone in that had the proof on it the representative said there was nothing they could do in the store and it was a customer service issue. How ABSURD!!! Aren't they representatives of Verizon? Will be filing a formal complaint with Verizon, speaking with the manna get at this location and hopefully speaking to a district manager. Verizon's customer service has gone way down hill!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Was in this store to do an upgrade after my phone broke and was told because it was an early upgrade I had to purchase a "Jetpack" for a one time fee of $40. After my first bill seems I was scammed into a 2yr contract without being told. After 2hrs in store came time to sign the hundred papers involved with new purchase and apparently one was a contract I was told NOTHING about. 10 year customer and I was scammed and being told I  need to pay $150 to get out of this contract I was scammed into. Time to make the switch.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I had a complicated situation that a Verizon rep on the phone helped me work out a plan for. The in-store representative at this location refused to honor what the phone representative had planned and told me that he wasn't going to talk to me anymore. He then handed the phone back to my sister and walked away from her. He also kept talking to other people in the middle of his conversations with me and my sister. Just really unprofessional all around.<//text>

Self serving employee that is NOT customer focused.  I have been with Verizon over 15 years.  Verizon was having a deal on two iphone 7's for $10/mo each and I was shopping for two new lines and new phones for my kids Christmas. The employees was repeating my 'customer loyalty' to the company numerous times to me.  It was Tuesday before Christmas.  I let him know I would speak with my husband and return.  He said he was off Wednesday but will be there Thursday and come then.  He gave me his card. I came Thursday so he could make his commission off of my purchase because I told him I would and my word is honorable and can be trusted.  Well, I go and the deal ended Wednesday!  He gives this this 'oh so sorry' and goes to talk with his mgr and comes back with this iphone 5s offer that was more $$! At this point I say I want an offer for iPhone 6 or 6s and I get this $20+ response for the 6 at 16GB.  I ask for 32GB and he said they don't have it and it would be more $$.  I had his back now he needs to have mine.  Nothing.  He let me down.  His store let me down.  Get this...****BEST BUY IS ACROSS THE STREET****!  I left Verizon, went across the street, was offered two iphone 6s's, 32 GB for $14.99 through Verizon!  And an hour later I had Christmas for my kids.  Thank you BEST BUY (who I normally despise) for having this mama's back!</Text>

The good: Judy who my wife & I signed up with was wonderful and this review is in no way a reflection on her.

The Bad: My wife & I were with Sprint for the last couple years and decided to switch and try verizon... That was a HUGE mistake.

The bill with verizon was going to be $160 for two iPhone 6's, one hot spot and 3gb of data. We knew verizon was going to be more but we liked Judy and decided to go with it.

After canceling we were contacted by Sprint and offered 6gb of data and a $400 bill credit for the same phones for $104... Right. What would you do? Cancel? Yup.. Me too.

Less than 24 hours later we canceled our verizon service and returned the phones in brand new perfect condition.

verizon made zero attempts to retain our business before or after we cancelled with them.. But they were beyond happy to charge us a restocking fee of $124... Yup $124 fee for a product and service we were going to be overcharged for in the first place.

Maybe they figure if they don't have a chance to over charge us every month for their over rated service they have to get is somehow?

Well verizon I can promise you two things:

1. You will NEVER have my business or my wife's again.. Ever

2. I will make sure to cost you more money in lost business than you stole from me. We're about two hours in and I've got two people to cancel your service already.

Please understand this isn't a review from a negative person. Take a look at my other reviews, I've never given anyone a 1 star review despite 1 star service many times.

I've always contacted the business and spoke directly with them in an attempt to resolve the issue.

That's not possible with Verizon.

The manager was supposed to call us back in a few minutes and we're still waiting... Two hours later. This company could care less< /review>

<Review>not very knowledgeable staff and in the end after purchasing a phone I had to return it due to a mistake the representative made on my phone purchase. He then incorrectly completed my return and still charged me for the restocking and activation fees. I then went to another retailer and repurchased my phone as well as had to have them remove the previous fees from the Verizon representative that completed my return.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d955234ae2007f:0x98fe3e173e21025b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We stopped in midday Sunday and the place was mobbed. There was over an hour wait to talk with an employee. People were sitting around everywhere looking like they were in hell.

We left.</review>

(Translated by Google) Whenever we come here to see the new phones, the employees have no sales attitude, they just point out where they are and they don't give information and that we are with them, we always end up going to the best buy in front.

(Original)
Siempre que venimos aquí para ver los nuevos teléfonos, los empleados no tienen actitud de venta, solo señalan donde están y no dan información y eso que estamos con ellos, siempre terminamos yendo a best buy que está enfrente.<//text>

<Text>Food was good but the burittos were a little bit slumping from the skin getting soggy. Really wished they toasted the tortillas and cut the burittos on a bias especially when sitting down to help make it easier to eat. Also some chips being included would be great too. It's a nice plus that they take Triton cash and the food comes out quickly although the above ground parking during the lunch rush is extremely scarce. Thankfully you can validate parking for free no matter where you're parking.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS7jCAqdEr7XQMgpZQiBd_SmQYdrHQsUbZzoSu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOOHqgAPcRPcj58a4-yM4q725Eh-YURHPQ5zb2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

< review>
I am really pleased with the new management of this place. My only experience with the previous management was a large catering order that went horribly wrong - it arrived 2 hours late and with half the food missing. Luckily the bill was fixed to reflect that but since this was for our "welcome to our new office" party it was a huge disappointment and I had fully sworn the place off for anything in the future. Once I found out they were under new management, I decided to give them a whirl personally. The fish tacos are quite good and I do appreciate the option of mixing and matching which tacos I want to try. The build your own bowl is a cool option as well since I can personalize what I want. There aren't a ton of vegetarian options so personalizing is basically the only way to go. The food is kinda expensive for a normal work lunch so it's not someplace I go often. They offer Mexican coke in the bottle which I love and the staff is always very friendly and patient. The guacamole is absolutely one of the best I've ever had anywhere which will keep me coming back. :)</review>

Un Mondo is a great contemporary twist on delicious Mexican food. The atmosphere is very clean and upbeat with a great system set up on how to order your food. How you order is you walk in and there's three big menus set up on the wall with cards below them to fill out on how exactly you want your food (just like Which Which). Then you take it to the person at the counter. And then take a seat and they will bring it to you in a jiffy.

The staff is Awesome as well. The owner is super friendly and informative. April who is at the counter is the best, super sweet and makes sure you are doing alright and you're happy with everything.

Lastly the food is bomb! Make sure to try all the salsas too :)</Text>

I tried this place for the first time today and I loved it.  You build your own combo, which was a bit confusing, but the food is really fresh, healthy and tastes very good.  I very much liked the idea of having healthy food at a very reasonable price.  I ordered a bowl of steak meat with beans, lettuce, onion and corn, and it was only $10 including tax.  I will definitely come to this place again next time I visit San Diego area.<//Review>

<Review>The food is excellent. When we came we got the surf and turf burrito which was delicious. I built my own chicken taco and got a side of papas. Do yourself a favor and always get the papas! The service was mostly okay, way over-priced but good.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Good food. You can craft your own dishes (burritos, bowls, tacos) or you can pick one of their preplanned ones. You make your choices on paper and hand them to the cashier, who inputs it into their system. There are 6 or so meats; 15 or so additional ingredients like rice, cilantro, and sour cream; and a standard selection of salsas. Our meals came with chips. Food came out fast. There's parking in the lot right in front but it's often full.</Review>

<text>I agree with some of the other bad reviews here that are recent. This place used to be good, but I have been twice in the last two weeks and ordered the same burrito but got it entirely different.

I ordered a California burrito twice this week and both times there was no guacamole. That's just ridiculous. I even added sour cream one time and it came with no sour cream? I was charged for it but didn't get it?!

It sucks because this place was REALLY good a few months ago but the people who are making the food now are BAD. How do you forget an ingredient when there are only like 6? That's scary.<//text>< Response>

Just ok. The food was alright, nothing special. They seem to want to fuse a few world flavors with Mexican food, but they don't seem to really have it down. There are two amazing food spots in the same shopping center, go there instead.< /Review>

Food was great, the California​ Burrito was really good! That said, the place is not well taken care of - the cola machine was broken, the interiors/kitchen seem to be run down. Still, worth a visit.< /text>

The rice was sticky, tortilla not well cooked and the burrito filled with rice and beans only, where as i opted for cilantro, lettuce, onions they were either completely missing or very less. I would not pay 11 bucks for rice and beans again.< /review></record>

<Review>The most expensive, mediocre mexican food in San Diego. I bought a California Burrito, Small Drink and Chips & Guac for almost $20 and it tasted like I made it (mediocre and amateur).

You can literally buy the same thing that's 2x better ANYWHERE in San Diego for HALF the PRICE (like Rigo's, Vallartas etc.)

This place is insanely overpriced and overrated.

If you are in the area, walk a hundred feet and go to the Pita place instead.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

- Pricier side.
- Carnitas bowl is great. Meat is tasty, tender. Habanero sauce is super spicy so ask for it on the side if you can't take intense spicy.<//text>

Cons: Expensive for the portion size. Meat was dry and beans had no flavor. Served lukewarm, which in hindsight, probably lead to my biggest con: moderate food poisoning later that day. Would not recommend.<//review>< Response>

I waited 20 minutes for a burrito. That took up almost my entire lunch break. On top of that I paid more than 10$ for it and when it finally came out to me, it wasn't the burrito I ordered.  It's not that hard. Don't come here, waste of time and money.< /text>

It's a nice California-style taco place, I came by for their Taco Tuesday.

They don't advertise it at all as far as I can see, but they offered carnitas tacos and pastor tacos, both for $1.50 each on Taco Tuesday.

Maybe it's because I went in late-ish at 8:30pm, but they are the slowest taco place I have ever been to before. There weren't too many people in there, maybe half the seats were empty, but they took 15-20 minutes to prepare each order.

Also, looking around, everyone's orders were rife with errors. For-here orders became to-go. My order sat around for a while because the cashier assumed I left for some reason until I asked. Some people got flags to put on their tables with their order numbers and some didn't. Pretty strange.

The pastor was unusual - it was literally just the pastor meat sitting on tortilla. However, they crisped up the meat really nicely, so it tasted good, particularly with the orange salsa, so I'm not sure I can complain. However, I wonder if that's how it was meant to come out or if they messed it up. I've never seen a bare taco like that before not at a place where you can add in fillings yourself.

The carnitas was also nicely crisped up. I think they messed up my order the first time around - I asked for 2 regular and 1 without cilantro, and all 3 came out with just bare meat and onions. I went back and ordered another and this time it was with onions and cilantro. I'm a little unclear whether the first one was the mistake, or the second one, but I assume with the cilantro is the way it was supposed to come. I like the flavor of the pastor better, but I preferred this one for having the accompaniments of onions and cilantro.

The food was good, and at a great price on Taco Tuesday, but it was a pretty weird experience how they seemed to screw up practically everything that could be screwed up.< /Text>

Asked for a bowl of lettuce beans and rice, took them 20 minutes for it to come out(I was the only one in the restaurant) sans beans and rice, and left me throwing up into the night with moderate food poisoning. 10/10 would throw up again.< /text>

Love this hospital!!! The staff is amazing and they take me in right away! This is definitely my go to hospital. I took my daughter in and Once i checked her in it was only about 15 minutes until a doctor diagnosed her with a condition she had which was treatable and I couldn’t have been more happier with my experience 🙏🏻< /Text>

This was not the first time I was there over the last 8 years or so.They continually out perform other local hospitals.  Scheduling, testing and customer service is outstanding. The staff is wonderful and the facilities are very good.  They seem to be very organized.  I will continually request from the ambulatory service to take me there every time.</Review>

A midnight visit to the ER with my 89 year old mother was such a smooth and organized visit.  Major tests were ordered such as cat scans and blood work and performed without delay. The staff was organized and friendly.  Luckily we were sent home to recuperate.  I was impressed with the facility and am happy that Inland Valley ER is close to my home.</Review>

Unfortunately this is a facility that smiles through their teeth until they actually have to do anything. Recently, I called in to try and see where my family member was and when I asked the hotel operator Sandra if maybe they had another name on file and to maybe look into that instead, she just replied very snarky “I don’t know I’m not the nurse I wouldn’t know” and I had to tell her I was just trying to see if she could look another last name up and again she asks in such a snarky voice “What’s the spelling?”

When I asked for her name she so proudly said it so good job inland valley, you’re proudly sporting a poor hotel operator with no manners. You work in a medical facility, have basic customer service skills or get out of there. You are speaking to people calling in often to find out how a loved one is doing.

On top of that, they never make sure the patient can receive and sign a HIPPA AUTHORIZATION so that you a loved one can get more than just bread crumbs from the nurses. They say one thing but the patient says another, they won’t take the effort to do anything so that you can all get on the same page on what’s going on. They don’t even know if he was discharged, somehow he was there a week ago and now he’s not.< /text>

My experience at Inland Valley Surgical center (total knee replacement done) was very positive from the initial steps of pre-op to post op/discharge the hospital personnel were excellent - the aides, nurses, my doctor & his surgical staff, anesthesiologist to the recovery unit nurses, physical therapy and discharge plan couldn’t have made my procedure more positive! The nursing staff and all were so professional & courteous in taking care of me. I thank them all for this very positive & successful  stay....my surgery was excellent!< /Review>

<review>I was so impressed with the care! Professionalism and cleanliness of the hospital.
They showed nothing but concerned for my well-being.
Everyone wore mask and had sanitizers available at all times.
The staff from the time I walked in the door was fantastic. I was cared for in such a timely manner.

I was brought in by ambulance and it was probably the worst experience I have ever had. The nurses took me off the gurney from the ambulance, put me in a wheelchair and stuck me out in the emergency room waiting area for several hours. I never saw a doctor, I was having extreme shortness of breath and never saw anyone from respiratory, They took xrays of my chest and did a CT Scan but I never got any of the results. Finally after more than 4 hours waiting I told them I was leaving and I would have another hospital examine me. I started to leave with my IV still in place and the nurse finally offered to take it out. I had her remove it and I left. I would not recommend that hospital to anyone and I am considering contacting my attorney to sue! End result was I had pneumonia and could've died! There is no reason behind their lousy treatment and I am still traumatized over the whole thing.</review>

Doctor said my dad had to have surgery. He was not very Happy about it. My father had bad experience in the pass in the Emergency Room. As we enter the Emergency Room the security Officers said I was not allowed to enter the Hospital only the patient. I was worried about my father. The security officer was rude he did not even care to hear what I had to say. I did not know were I had to pick up my father after the surgery or if someone will call me. As I was trying to talk to the security officer. A Female security Officer approached us and She introduced her self. she explained all the Process to me. She gave me the phone number to the Surgery Center. She said not to worry she will take good care of my dad.  After I picked up my Dad  he told me  Security Officer Angie took me to the Laboratory and then Drop me Off at the surgery waiting area. She introduced me to the security officer in the surgery area. Angie took my paper work and gave it to the nurses. She also gave me the security phone number in case I needed to call her if I needed her help. My Dad was so excited telling me how his surgery went well and he feels Angie made him feel comfortable at all times. I was so worried for nothing Angie kept her promise. Thank you so much for everything and I have to say It is true Angels do exist in some Hospitals.  Thank you  Security Officer Angie and everyone in the surgery Department.<//text>

Very horrible RN staff. No communication and very condescending. There is a level of hospitable care required for this sort of job, and their ER staff lacks that. Not once has a PA, CNP, or MD consulted on lab/test results. Patient access to chart is low quality as well.< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I was dropped off at the front entrance for a slip I had at a grocery store by a friend because I couldn't drive due to the pain I was in and was greeted by security of whom kindly helped me into a wheelchair. From there I was rolled over to be admitted into the er. There I was asked basic admittance questions and then was rolled over to the waiting room where I waited shortly before I was called in and rolled to room/section with a curtain. I was asked some questions by the physician who I had to cut off to tell him what was wrong with me. He said he would give me something for pain and then return to give me x-rays and a full CT.
I was give a pill and a shot and then was rolled back into the waiting room. There I waited about 15- 20 mins and a male nurse came out and asked me if I was ready to go home. I was in pain so it took me a while to think of what to say because I hadn't even been examined. As I looked around for a second in bewilderment he then offered for to see the doctor.

I went in and waited for a second in a chair that I wasn't informed on that could be adjusted, which is what I needed since my siatica had been injured. I squirmed in pain and rolled over and had to noticed myself that I could ease my discomfort.
The doctor finally came in after about five minutes and told me that he prescribed me flexoral and Motrin and only prescribed the cyclobezaprine and told me I was good to go, said ok and then walked off.

When I first got there I told him about my should being I. Pain and that I couldn't even move it and he DID NOT EXAMINE me nor my arm, not even range of motion. He didn't even poke my back along my spine.

I felt like I was being treated like some junkie that only went in there for drugs when I went in there because I slipped in a store and had bad pain all over my body and wanted to make sure everything was ok and get any info I needed for an incident report.

I had to go in there when I really didn't want to at times like these and because he didn't check me out I have to go to a whole other hospital and be checked out because of other resulting injuries the doctor didn't even look into.< /Text>< pics>

I had something stuck in my throat. It was very hard for me to breathe.  I had my wife rush me to E.R.
They said I had to wait in line I was # 4.
That was ridiculous,  I could hardly breathe and they were making me wait while the guy in front of me was in there for a headache.
Come on Inland Valley, get it together.
Next time I will go to Temecula.
Don't waste your time at this hospital unless you want to die.</Text>

A very pleasant experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I had Jennifer and Elizabeth help me with preparing me for surgery and for post recovery. Elizabeth stayed with me because I was taking longer to recover. She worked over her normal hours and assisted me with getting me drinks and Cracker until I was able to leave. Thank you for taking such good care of me and my wife. Take care and God bless.

I have never, ever been in as much pain as I was when I got to the ER here.  Ultimately I was admitted to a room where the staff tried to comfort me. The west wing staff were so accommodating and professional even though I was probably being  difficult. If I could give a 10 rating I would. They eventually figured out it was a very bad reaction to the Moderna  vaccine.

<Text>I was afraid to go to the hospital under the current situation with covid, but I was having such severe abdominal pain that I told my husband I had to go to the hospital.  From the time we walked foot inside until they discharged me everyone I had contact with was very compassionate, efficient, and professional.  My ER nurse Lauren was super sweet and caring to my needs and pain level.  The Dr assigned to me was on top of things and ordered tests that took place immediately.  I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of care I received.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Had cause to go to IVMC.  Had not been there for years and I was pleasantly surprised.  Place was very clean.  No waiting in the ER.  The staff were so nice and polite.  The doctor came to introduce herself, and if yu rate hospitals like hotels, I got a 5 star treatment.  I have nothing negative about my treatment and care.  I just have to thank everyone, I mean everyone who took care of me that day.  Thank you all.<//Review>

I went into the er I was greeted right away by the check in nurse I told him I was scared and nervous he made sure I was okay while he was checking me in and made small talk to get my mind off things.  The insurance processer greeted me she was very well mannered and had such a great demeanor to her she made the process smooth and quick! Once I was seen by the DR he was very nice I let him know what was happening and he let me express what my concerns were he made sure to let me know everything was going to be okay! The nurse I had was very nice as well she made sure to keep checking on me and let me know when the DR would see me. Overall my experience here was truly amazing and the care that I received was out of this world everyone made me feel like I was at home!!  I dont ever wish to go back to the ER for any reason but if I do I will chose this hospital and highly recommend it to others!!</Text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>It started out fine, I was shuttled in an ER exam room,, a doctor ordered a CT scan and the staff hooked up a EKG. About an hour later they informed me they found no problems. This took about an hour & a half. Take in mind I arrived at approximately 6.30am I was asked if I wanted to go home at 10.30am. No one asked if I needed anything for four hours. I had to signal to an aid to come to my room I needed water, she brought me some. They obviously thought I was fine. That’s not the inland hospital I remember. I do realize there is a Covid crisis & I was part of it. I received my second shot the day before. No Immediate reaction however the next morning I was transported to the hospital with severe muscle weakness, no fever but I couldn’t walk unassisted.< /Text>< pics>

I give 2 stars because they do eventually end up helping you as much as they can. But you instantly lose faith when the ER nurses are talking bad about the ER doctors right in front of you. I sat listening to 2 nurses talk about how unfortunate it was for my husband that he was assigned to the doctor he was assigned to because he was so slow and just never cared about his patients. Not 5 minutes later that same doctor came in having no idea who any of his patients were when the nurses asked for updates. The biggest complaint is how long it took. Normally I'm very understanding, it is an ER and ppl get hurt and sometimes they need help before you, but even the nurses were talking about how they didn't understand why the doctors were so backed up when there aren't that many patients. Maybe the nurses need to remember that patients and visitors have ears and we can hear you gossiping before you turn around and lie to us about what is taking so long.<//review>

Unbelievable! My wife had Brain Surgery to remove a tumor. Surgery took 4 hours and she was put in ICU, had no control of body function and no ability to move. Her food was placed in front of her and served in containers that were sealed, she was expected to open them and feed herself. After 3 days she was still unable to move on her own as well as speak on her own. The hospital decided to release her to me (80 years old) no mobility equipment or other hospital equipment was provided. Brought her home, had to borrow a walker to get her into the house. She fell and I had to call 911 for help. The EMT's put her in bed at home and she was totally immobile for 2 days before I could get medical transport to a Rehab Center. If you have a choice, stay away from this hospital.< /Text>

Because of Covid I am not allowed into Surgery Center to see how my husband was treated.  I had to call them to see if he was out of surgery and told he was and come and get him.  I did that and believe he was released too early.  Perhaps they needed the space.  Sent home with only written instructions.  The nurse who delivered him to my car was not the person I spoke with on the phone so some confusion there.  I get him home read the discharge papers and see 2 drugs were prescribed but never sent over to the pharmacy.  I go to pharm and nothing.  I called doctors office and surgery center.  Received a call at 9 p.m. from a nurse who said doctor was to call.  No calls, nothing.  Not too impressed.< /Text>

Came in an ambulance to get abdominal pain checked out, and the were all very kind, and very professional.  They explained everything as they did it, and asked if I had questions.

I did have to wait quite awhile for a CT scan, but that is normal at most hospitals.

Very positive experience for an ER.< /Review>

The ER ambulance drivers, nurses and doctors are angels. They were very busy with many COVID patients and Traumas at the same time. Many were on overtime hours working tirelessly, quickly, and professionally with great accuracy. I felt safe and very well cared for. Yes,  hero’s, and life savers for the betterment of humanity.  My heart is full of gratitude.</Text>

< Review>
Things are done  so different now i’m assuming due to the Covid. They put you in the ER to talk to a doctor And he orders any test He believes to be necessary. Then they put you back in the waiting room until you’re called for whatever tests you need. Then  you wait there again until you’re called back to the ER for the doctor to give you the results of your test and in my case I was released and sent home. After waiting nearly 5 hours in the waiting room. I know this is not their fault there’s so much going on but it was very uncomfortable.I just pray this Covid is over soon so people can get more comfortable care. Nonetheless I had a good doctor and all the nurses were excellent. Thank you for everything Sandra Miller</Review>

<Text>Good speed of care and the staff is really nice. However, they're more of a referral service than a place to be treated — multiple times when I've been there they've "been unequipped to provide service/care" for my case and have simply forwarded me to the ER (which is a major letdown).</Text><response>{'time': 1607547320818, 'text': 'Hi, Amaviah.

Such a good experience here. I came in because of my eating disorder and they were so kind and helpful to me. They gave me medications to keep my food down, and gave me resources to get the help I need to recover. I had a horrible experience trying to get help from temecula valley hospital before coming here, and once I got help from this hospital it was a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend them!! The staff is beyond understanding and nice❤️❤️</review>

I had surgery 11/30/2020 and had to pay $600 a night for my hospital stay, they asked me to pay for 2 nights because that is the usual stay. I did so, but ended up staying one night. I called a week later about getting my money back and they said that Kaiser had to say I didn't owe any money. Fast forward a month Kaiser sent me a letter saying I didn't owe anything and my copay was only $600. I call Inland Valley and they say it takes a while to return the money into my account. I call again 3 weeks later and they said it should be returned soon. 3 months later and still nothing. I just don't understand why they have not returned my money back in to my account.<//review>

<Review>Upon arriving, the guard or attendant came quickly to the car and picked up my daughter with a wheel chair (excellent).
Wait time was reasonable for checking in about fifteen mins.
Wait time to see a doctor was about an hour and a half (to long of a wait).
Wait time to get a scan (not good, waited over two hours) left the hospital at 12:30 after arriving at about 8:30 pm.
Hospital was busy and everyone was doing there job.  Luckily my daughter felt a little better so we went home.  Never received the C-T scan.
I informed a nurse and she told the doctor we were leaving.  So the doctor came out and spoke to us.  He was very understanding, recommended that we come back if the pain persisted.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I came here for an appendicitis.  This horrible place held me for over 5 hours    lied about sending an ambulance, and is not clean. They held me while knowing that the other hospital, Kaiser, had already prepared for my appendectomy.  Do not go unless you are practically dying! Horrible hospital!<//Review>

They put me in a consultation room that was freezing and then denied me a blanket because of a fever but then never medicated me for said fever. The doctor didn't even come into the room. She called me on the phone. Yes covid is not fun but if you are afraid of catching something don't work in a hospital. To top it all off the doctor wrote a prescription for 3 times a day for 7 days as needed but only gave me 9 pills. That math really doesn't add up.< /Text></record>

I have had several major procedures at IVMC, and this last one (12-16-20) was just like all the others....PERFECT. The staff was, as always, courteous, friendly, professional, knowledgeable, caring and put me at ease from the moment I arrived till They wheeled me to my ride home. The anesthesiologist was the best I have ever had. I came out of it easily and quickly. I will never go anywhere else...They are just like the 4077th MASH unit in Korea...."BEST CARE ANYEHRE"!!!< /Text>

This hospital over charged us $500.00 for a deductible that was not applicable per my insurance policy plan. We paid $600 total for my daughter’s  ER visit, $100 for copay and $500 deductible because the registration lady at the hospital said we owed a deductible (it turns out we didn’t) per our policy, which turned out to be incorrect after checking with our insurance company. I tried calling the hospital billing department multiple times to get our deductible $500 back and they have completely ignored my request for immediate refund. Please don’t trust this hospital when it comes to paying deductibles or copays, they will try to rip you off! Ask them to bill you and when you receive your statement in the mail, call your insurance company and make sure it’s correct. Otherwise, if you pay at the hospital and there is an error, you are screwed!<//text>

<Text>The nurse who did my triage could really use some more training, had I not known any better I might have chosen to just not be seen because I presented for respiratory distress, severe body pain after being tested positive for covid and was told by her these were all normal symptoms of covid and that I could be seen but she didnt know that they could do anything for me. Thank God I decided to still be seen, the doctor was amazing and to find out I was starting to get pneumonia I was glad I ignored her ignorant comment because I was put on a bunch of different medications and had I not been seen things might of been worse for me.< /Text>< response>

Everyone was very helpful and nice. l was in the emergency room on Thursday, July 2nd from 3:30 to 7:30.  It was not that busy for such a long time.  I had fallen and needed x-rays, cat scan, blood work. No broken bones.  The nursing attendant (I think her name is Jennifer) was very nice and answered my questions.  Other than having to wait so long for results from the tests, I am pleased with my experience.

As soon as I walked through the door the security guard kindly greeted me, offered me ice for my arm and ensured I was “hanging in there” while waiting to be seen. The PA who evaluated me was thorough and understanding to my pain, as well as the x-ray tech who was gentle and accommodating. The nurse who wrapped my arm was extremely kind and helped ease my pain and worry with lighthearted jokes, which I enjoyed especially in such a stressful situation. I completely fell in love with the staff here and I’m so grateful for everyone who took care of me. I would recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>< Pics>

We had exceptional service July 23.2020 from the guard ,receptionist, nurse,respiratory, and especially from Doctor Churi I'm sure not how correct on his spelling who checked my husband.  Your service was fantastic especially during this pandemic! My husband was quickly assessed, given treatment and sent home within less than 2 hours. Thank you, it was very scary as my husband was having chest pain and you made it easy also allowing me to accompany my husband who has hearing deficiency and these face masks make it difficult for him to hear.< /Text>

On December 3rd I went to this facility very sick of COVID they took several exams and only gave me medicine . I was told to confine for quarantine with my family until I receive my COVID results, unfortunately my family got the virus and we all had all the symptoms.
My point is that they never called me with the results until now. I contact my primary provider to get COVID treatment.
I called inland hospital for results and they nicely informed me that I had to register on line and follow too many steps, unfortunately I din’t get success.
I really believe that this company does not care for seniors who are not capable to navigate fluidly on computers. If someone don’t have computer or doesn’t know how to use them that’s considered patients neglected<//text>

I have never dealt with a hospital that was more incompetent in my life. Save yourself and your loved ones the trouble of dealing with utter ineptitude. It is only a matter of time before this hospital is served with a huge lawsuit that will bankrupt it indefinitely. Inland Valley Medical Center regularly violates HIPPA. I have counted at least 3 violations in less than 2 weeks. This hospital allowed a  stranger to visit with an unconcious John Doe, with no means to identify him, during a global pandemic even though they confirmed and cleared that the night before that his next of kin of the only person suited to see and identify him. This hospital does not share notes on patients between shifts. They also do no keep accurate information on patients either, can't even keep a birthday on a patient right after being corrected more than once. The social workers are awful, they can't even answer basic questions and do not follow through with basic services. The hospital needs a complete overhaul in leadership and I cannot wait until someone sues them for neglience to ensure that patience get the dignity, privacy and proper care that they deserve.</text>

For 24 hous a day I was in the best care possible. To name drop a few names ( I wish I could remember each one of you) Janie, Regina, Tara, Grace, JJ, Nancy, Mickey, Reggie, and many others treated me with the best care imaginable.

Outstanding patient care with compassion and knowledge of presenting signs and symptoms.  I was impressed with the nurses and physician that cared for me.  Nothing was left to change with communication of my status. I received a completed work-up in a timely manner for my symptoms.  Moreover, my primary physician called me the same day with a follow up appointment, which was initiated by the Inland Valley ER staffs.  I am grateful for the caring and professional care received.  Many thanks.</review>

< review>
Nurses were awesome post Microdisectomy for my back. They took good care of me, made sure I got what I needed and took the time to get to know me. For the most part the nurses took the time to build a relationship (shout out to Kayla and Allison) for being pretty new but going above and beyond.

Service was crazy fast. Got mri, X-ray, blood work done within a few hours. That would have taken days outside of the ER. Got into a room pretty fast as well. All nurses and techs very professional.

I gave a 3 because of the COVID protocols. I was able to walk out of the room several times without a mask and when I was literally being wheeled into the operating table they found out I didn’t get a COVID test. I had to wait two hours in OP prep until my rapid results came in. Extremely disappointed the hospital missed that. Sitting in pre op with more time to think about what can go wrong wasn’t cool. I believe this was a miss by ER dr not the surgery team.

I would however attend the hospital again if I needed another visit.< /review>

Back again to update on my experience 3 months later.

Went in with a broken ankle.

Left with a broken ankle.

Was completely over looked.

Now I’m being called my collectors for a 1,000 bill for nothing.

Posting pics of both my ankles so you can see the difference the swollen bigger one is the broken one.

3 month later it clicks it hurts to walk on not healed and my knee is affected.

Was told by a sports medicine doctor I’m going to need physical therapy.</Review>

My husband was recently in the hospital for five days in the ICU unit. I want to thank the staff for the great care he received. The nurses were knowledgeable, professional, and attentive. Everyone was friendly and anticipated my husband’s needs. Special thanks to “Mo” in physical therapy who took the time to show my husband the easiest way to put his brace on and off as well as how to get in and out of bed. I was very impressed by the fact that everyone I dealt with in the entire hospital, took the time to help me with any questions and requests. Thank you again and know that you are APPRECIATED!!!<//review>

The Doctor was very patient and listened to all my concerns and the information I had from the time of my Telle Appt with my Doctor on Oct.1st-8th. After that and the physical exam she put a plan of labs,xrays and ultrasound to check the areas in question to my symptoms. I was given a perscription complete print out of all my tests along with information on taking care of the issues I was experiencing for my continued care. And to make sure that My Doctor has the information of my visit and the measures taken for my health.  They were great to me and make you feel like your issues are not a generic issue.  Thanks to Inland Valley Hospital E.R.  The antibiotics are doing good my blood pressure is in lower levels but not normal yet but 1 day doesn't change the world.<//review>< user>

I was greeted and taken back to the out patient surgical center all with in ten minutes.  My nurse, nicknamed Bang, was very sweet, thorough and very helpful getting me changed out of my street clothes and was very friendly getting me prepared for my procedure.  Everyone else was friendly and they made sure I was warm and comfortable before the surgery began.  After surgery I experienced the same friendliness and concern for my comfort and pain.</text>

HORRIBLE MEDICAL RECORDS DEPARTMENT, VERY UNHELPFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DEATH CERTIFICATE INFORMATION. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR SYSTEM IS SO POORLY ORGANIZED. NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU OR WANT TO HELP YOU FOR THAT MATTER. I ABSOLUTELY HATE WORKING WITH THIS HOSPITAL. IF I COULD LEAVE ZERO STARS,  THAT WOULD STILL BE TOO MANY< /text>

There was very little privacy in the emergency room. I could hear others talking to the medical staff about their issues and I didnt feel I could talk to my hospital staff in privacy which was very important to me.
The exam room I was in was very dirty. The floor was sticky, dirty, and drops of blood on the floor.<//review>

Tbh I think the staff and dr who attended  me don’t love what they do. Only 2 staff members seem to feel for me or act like they have emotions. Everyone else including the dr seem so over it.

Didn't expect such poor service at Inland Valley. Walked in to the Emergency Room entrance and stood right in front of security (you have to check in) and the security guard was just on his phone for literally a minute as I stood in front of him. I didn't interrupt him because I thought MAYBE it was something important. But after a while I walked over to the volunteer lady (who was much nicer but unfortunately I had to gi back to security). Finally he asked me "what do you want" without looking at me. Like, come on man I don't expect much but jeez you should at least man up and look at someone when you talk to them. He was some old white dude with weird ears and I regret not catching his name. Finally I left him. He didn't even give me a pass , which was the only thing I needed from him. Worthless. Truly made such a great hospital look bad. If I find him, I'm clapping.</text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>The employees are very friendly, experienced and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, there ER is to small and not enough employees to take of injuries and sick patients. There lobby was not even full and I had to wait for four hours for someone to put in a IV in my arm. Then I had to go back into the lobby with IV in arm, wait another couple of hours to have my
x-rays, go back out to the lobby and then wait for my x-rays. Then I went back in the ER for the doctor to tell about my test results. The doctor forgot to let a nurse know I was done. Then a nurse asked me if the doctor talked to me and I said yes. Finally I had a nurse took out my IV. I was there from 11am to 5:30pm. If you need help right away I would I would an ambulance. Ambulance patients are first to have help. Walk-in patients have to wait until someone helps them. If you’re walking patient call first otherwise you’re gonna have to wait a long time.😁< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I had gastric sleeve and gall bladder removal surgery by Dr. Suh on 9/18/20 and I was released to home on 9/20/20. The care was excellent. From preop to recovery to the med/surg unit all the nurses and staff were incredibly kind, patient, knowledgeable and comforting. Everyone was amazing but especially the following nurses, Cynthia,(preop) Lauren, Normita, Natalie and Gloria (med surg). I was too out of it to remember the names of the recovery staff but they were amazing as well. Thank you so much for making my hospital stay that much more comfortable.< /Review>

<Review>Thank you for the great care. During my day and a half stay for total hip replacement, all of the nurses were great from every shift. They were concerned  about my comfort and my needs. I was fortunate enough to have a private room so I was able to get a little more rest and privacy. I even got a visit from the RN who cared for me in August! That really lifted my spirits that she cared enough to stop by my room. Thank you Kaleena!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

They treated me well in the OR and recovery room but when I was admitted to my hospital room I started getting forgotten!  I rang for the nurse and waited over an hour for someone to help. I ended up having to use my cell phone to call the main hospital number and ask for help. I got hung up on twice. This happened to me more than once in 10 hours. I was yelling Help! Help! and no one would come.

After I was released and went home I had to go back to the ER the pain was unbearable. It took three nurses multiple times each stabbing me to get an IV started. My arms are black and blue from all the times they tried to get blood and start the IV. They have a sign on the wall that says ‘We want you to be comfortable, if you are in pain let us know’. Well, I let them know many times, but getting pain medication is very difficult. No one wants to prescribe any since they don’t want to get in trouble. The problem is, the patient has to just suffer. I told them they should take down the sign since they won’t give you any pain medication and you are just left to suffer on your own.<//review>

This was an unfortunate and painful accident but the care I received was outstanding and professional.  My entire care team was prompt, knowledgeable, worked well together, and they all had an excellent bedside manner.  From the doctors, to the amazing nurses, the lab specialists and their painless blood draws, physical therapy and their patient encouragement, the respiratory therapists and the aides and cna’s and their excellent help and even housekeeping; all the departments were outstanding.<//text>

We were seen in a timely manor (I would have appreciated if they had wiped down the chair I sat in for ER check-in. The patient ahead of me was clearly suffering from flu like symptoms).
Everyone was friendly and professional.
The PA Ben was extremely good.
Julie, who took the x-rays was  thorough and pleasant. The equipment seemed out dated and the lens was extremely dusty.< /text>

Took my girlfriend here after she broke her toe. They made us wait 5 hours to be seen and then charged her $3,000 for an X-ray and a nurse practitioner to say meh it's broken just rest it. She has insurance, I'm completely irate, this hospital is run by immoral con-men who should spend the rest of their lives behind bars.<//text>

<Text>Charged $569 and $53 for two minutes with a nurse. This place is unfair and corrupt. Avoid it all all costs. There was literally no services rendered other than a few spoken words and Tylenol yet they want $569 and sent it to collections. Greedy doctors and nurses like them are one of the biggest things that are wrong with this world. Can’t believe this level of corruption can exist and I’m stuck paying for two minutes and zero services rendered other than Tylenol and not even a take home prescription!!! just wow!!! How evil!!<//Text><resp>{'time': 1579105272848, 'text': 'Thank you for reaching out to us. We would like to take the opportunity to address your concerns with you directly.

<rate>4<//rate><Text>All hospital personnel involved were very kind and showed they cared about me and my stay at Inland Valley Medical Center.

Person's that stood out:
- Trauma Team of nurses and doctor's all showed concern and interest in keeping me as calm and comfortable as possible.
- Nurse Nicolle was awesome. Caring, Kind and also funny. Bedside manner was perfect.
-  CNA Derrick was also caring, courteous and had a very good bedside manner too.
-  Nurse Mel was also responsive. attentive and comforting.

The only issue may have been the amount of time I had to wait to be discharged. The waiting time, I thought, could have been expedited a bit but that was all that I had issue with. Overall I had the best care considering the physical discomfort I was experiencing from my accident.<//Text>< gmap_id>

horrible.   i was there for 8 hours.  granted, they state they were busy.  the sat me in the waiting room the entire time with excruciating abdominal pain.  they medicated me with norco after telling them that i had high sensitivity opiates.  one dr told me that they had to do blood work because my 1st troponin  had come back abnormal.   they had to do two more, causing me to be there an additional 4 hours.   the only reason we even found out about the additional 4 hour delay is because the triage nurse. Carrie (who was amazing) realized how long we where there and checked on the delay.     she helped expedite the process ,  even kept checking in on us.  she actually drew the last troponin and ran it to the lab.    by the time i was getting ready to discharge, a different dr  pulled us in and  gave me my results.   he said all was normal.   all three troponins were NORMAL.    so why do three?  i feel like it could have been because i am a kaiser patient and they saw dollar signs...   i don't know ..  i am so upset that i had to be in a waiting room.. in pain, drugged up and crawling out of my skin.<//Text>

My husband was there for 5 hours complaining that he couldn't breathe.  They ran test and sat him in the waiting room when done. He continued to ask the chatty nurses for oxygen  because he couldn't breathe and they wouldn't give it to him. I picked him up and took him to Temecula hospital.I highly suggest Temecula they actually care! Not our first rodeo with Inland. They walk in slow motion lol</review>

Similar to a lot of these honest reviews, the ER staff is completely negligent In providing adequate health care. Went in here to be misdiagnosed and treated like I was a drug addict criminal or something, simply for seeking health care here when extremely sick. Not sure how this place is still operating while providing such negligent care to patients including me. I would not come here again if my life depended on it.  Also consistent with other reviews, they seem to refuse to follow up via their contact us link they respond with and on their website</Text>

I'm not sure I get it...they don't allow you in to the ER if you have any symptoms of COVID (which I get), but they won't actually treat you if you come in with something else...BECAUSE of COVID.  I hurt my knee and they took x-rays and wouldn't do any other tests and I never saw anyone besides the nurse.  They gave me my results and talked to me openly in the waiting room about my health, despite HIPPA, with people surrounding me.  Then, without ever seeing a doctor, they sent me home to figure out what was wrong through an orthopedist.  They prescribed me Norco, even though I told her Norco makes me sick.  It was really just a waste of time.  Tell people that you won't help them BEFORE they wait the 4 hours thinking you will.  Don't use COVID as an excuse if you're not actually treating COVID patients.<//text>

this is an awful hospital I was previously a patient here and because of the medication I'm on the staff treated me so poorly and so awful it was a very bad experience then my brother gets brought here for a brain bleed and they would not let us go into the see him at all because of this covid-19 however we and all ended up getting the covid-19 from this hospital because they do not sanitized they have people walking around patience Hill but yet there are so big on not letting us see my brother but we still ended up getting it because my brother brought it home because they're poor lack of disinfecting and our whole family has the coronavirus because of this hospital if you could stay away from this hospital that would be your best bet</Review>

<text>I came to Inland ER as I had severe pain in my left shoulder and down my left arm since Friday night. I came to ER waited in line, 3 patients ahead of me. The tech took my name, problem, my BP And oxygen level. I told her I had just taken 325 of aspirin, so my pain level was at 6 or 7. I was directed back to the waiting room. I waited for 1 hour and a half. I asked, please how soon will they see me? I have a  lot of people here, was her reply.
Well, one and a half hour is a long time to wait when you have pain in your arm and you are elderly!! So, I gave her the cuff back and said I am leaving. I went home! I will never come to Inland ER  again!!</text>< pictures>

I had a great experience, as far as emergency room visits go. I was coming in for pain & an injury I've been dealing with for over a month. I fell backwards, while rollerblading backwards & did some serious damage in my hand/arm/wrist. I'd been seen at 2 other E.R's and they did not do the CT scan my orthopedic dr had requested. The dr at Inland Valley Medical Center was very sympathetic & understanding to my situation & injury. The hospital was clean & all the staff was professional. I was very grateful they heard me out & didn't just give me another xray when I knew the injury wasn't coming up in those.

I now know what's going on, and am on my way to getting the long term care I need for this injury. But 2 other ERs (Scripps & Palomar) had wasted my time.

I was given great care & will be returning for any future ER needs.< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>This hospital is a nightmare.  Don't go there.  They have no concern for the patient.  My husband had an accident and required an MRI of his spine.  I was there from 8:00 AM and asked to talk the doctor to get results repeatedly.  By 3:-00 they told me the doctor had gone home.  Never saw him.  Finally another doctor came in and gave the results.  He signed a discharge notice.  Both my husband and I felt he was not able to go home because of pain and instability and stated this.  They said because the doctor signed the discharge form it could not be reversed.  When they brought his food, he could not use his arms or feed himself.  They just left the food and left the room.  If I wasn't there to feed him, I guess he just would not eat.  They never changed his bandages.  When I got him home the dressing that was on his knee wound which was stapled was bloody and around his ankle.  Again, we felt he wasn't ready to go home and had a lot of pain.  It was Saturday evening, the pharmacies were closed, and they wouldn't give me any pain medications to get him through the knight.  "It was against the rules because they weren't a pharmacy".  They have a lot of rules, but none of them are good for the patient's welfare.  I could go on and on but will stop here.  I would give it 0 stars if that was an option.<//text>< pictures>

They just try and get you in and out . They force medicine into you and then when they look at your charts some nurses / doctors think you are just trying to get medicine . On multiple occasions I have heard doctors and nurses talk negatively about me to where I can hear them. I won’t be returning to this hospital ever again.< /Review><Time>1578037603700<//Time>< GmapID>

I was met in a timely manner and my comfort was always their priority. The nurses were all friendly and efficient. Unfortunately my surgery was called off at the last minute because of a communication error at the doctor's office, so I'll be back in 3 days to try again.<//text>

I had the most positive experience at Inland Valley Trauma Room yesterday.   I had fallen 14th from My Father's patio cover and had landed on my back. I was in excruciating pain when I took a deep breath, cough, or sneeze. I got right in and they immediately ruled out issues with my back, neck and ribs. All the staff, from  the doctor and nurses, to the X-ray techs had a very compassionate ,professionaland patient demeanor.< /Review>

I had a great experience during my visit to the ER a few days ago. The nurse at check in was great she got me in to see the doctor quickly, I was surprised how fast I was put in . I was in a lot of pain. Once I saw the PA I was immediately given medication to control my pain. The entire staff was great. I saw how caring the nurses and PAs  were and how attentive to the patients needs. Thank you for helping me feel better.</Review>

Was in terrible pain with a kidney stone so went to their ER instead of making the trek to a Kaiser Hospital in Riverside.. Was put in a waiting room of visibly sick( coughing and vomiting) and contagious people. No effort was made to separate people according to their illness or condition. When I was called back to a room, I was there for about 15 minutes so that I could get an IV
and meet the treating physician. It took 2 RNs and three vein attempts to draw blood and get the IV uncomfortably into my wrist. Then I was on my way to the "results waiting room" where I was left with my IV to be packed in with more sick people!   In this room, staff came in with computers, and with no regard for confidentiality asked people for their personal information.
I did receive special attention from Dr. Sims who removed me from the crowded room to discuss my results. He was the saving grace of the entire experience. Patient comfort and confidentiality, not a priority there.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168<//Gmap_id>< userid>

As with all emergency visits, many hours you are left totally alone in you very uncomfortable bed as if you have been forgotten.  Ring for a nurse, give them 10-15 minute to respond.  Hours later the Doctor comes in your room to tell you "go see your regular doctor".  Tell you the are going release, another 45 minutes go by before anyone shows up with your paperwork.

Release papers show that "Major Test and Procedures" shows that eight labels were printed at several different times between 7:36 and 7:57t. for the lab. "NO"  blood was collected
Under the circumstances  blood work needed to be done.

Urinalyses was done.
NOT HAPPY AT ALL</Review>

I had a great experience before and after surgery.
Pre-op RN: Rosalina “Beng” Valdez was The BEST nurse I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. She helped me calm my nerves and made sure I had all my questions answered.

Anesthesiologists: Dr. Chen great doctor, answered all my questions, gave me options and explained what could be done to relieve my pain after surgery.... not just that, he called me the day after to make sure I was doing well and gave me more advice to control my pain and helped me calm my post surgery nerves. Amazing Anesthesiologists, thank you Dr. Chen.

Post op RN: Cindy Sterndale The little time I spent with Nurse Sterndale was great, she was also great, helped reassured me that I was doing well. Taught me how to use crutches and was very helpful in explaining what to expect.

Overall, this hospital has great staff all around. Well educated and perfect bedside manners.

Couldn’t have asked for a better team.<//text>

I had to go to the ER twice in as many weeks for two different injuries (sliced hand and broken foot), and both times were positive experiences (as much as a trip to the ER can be positive). The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the waiting time was less than I've had at walk in clinics, and the treatment was thorough without me having to ask for services. Obviously, I hope I don't have to go back again, but I'm glad to know I'll get quality care if I do.</Text>

I went to the emergency room at Inland Valley.  I didn't have to wait hours (as I did in another local hospital) to be taken care of.  Within maybe 15 minutes my problem was discussed,  vitals were taken, my insurance info was taken and I was taken to an area to be seen by a doctor.  Within 5 minutes I was seen by the doctor, had my blood work done and the problem was diagnosed and treated.  I highly recommend this hospital.  It may not be as modern and fancy as the other local hospital but I find the doctors and nurses and general staff more efficient, compassionate and professional than other near by hospitals.</Review></record>

<text>There was one person ahead of me during the triage process.  It took about 20 minutes to triage this person who was laughing and smiling the whole time.  I, on the other hand, was in extreme pain and crying while waiting.  I was extremely annoyed the triage process took forever for the person ahead of me.  The triage nurse was also engaging in the laughs and giggles as if no other patients were waiting to get assessed.  I'd give the triage nurse a 2 star, maybe even 1 star.

However, my experience once called to the back, was great,  The PA was speedy to see me and had me in and out quickly.</text>< Resp>

My son and I were taken to Inland Valley’s trauma center via ambulance after a t/c. The EMT’s did more us than the staff at Inland.  Once I was off the gurney they asked we wait in the waiting room. After about an hour someone came to us checked our breathing and said we were good to go. The nurse that released us saw the abrasion my son had and put some ointment. We were not given a room,  proper attention or care.</review>

< Review>
It was a very busy night due to the rain and the flu, but I was treated very nicely. The nurses, radiology staff, the PA were kind and were apologetic about the wait. Visiting an ER that also is a Trauma center, I know the wait was going to be to be long. I found out there was nothing seriously wrong with me and despite the wait, I am glad I went.< /Review>

My husband came into the emergency room at 2:00 am.  There were only two other patients there at the time.  He had crushed his hand.  It was swollen to three times the size it should have been and very discolored and he was in serious pain.  They took an xray and said they couldn't see any broken bones and told him to follow up with his primary care doctor.  He was shocked when they went to release him without even wrapping his hand.  He asked the nurse if they were going to do anything for him and, only because he asked, they put an ace bandage on it.  The next day he went to urgent care.  The doctor there was very upset that they had sent him home like that.  He left there after having another xray (still showed no broken bones), had a half cast put on and wrapped it up.  That doctor also had him go get an MRI on it as she knew there was a lot of damage to the ligaments and muscles.  Really.... what kind of care was that he received from your hospital.  Our entire family has been using your hospital for emergencies, surgeries, and serious illness stays for the last 22 years since we moved here from the South Bay.  After that kind of care I probably will think twice about coming to you for any care again.  Was it because the doctor on staff that night was tired, not wanting to work, or just didn't care?  We are extremely disappointed in the care he received that night.  I would like to tell you the triage nurse was very nice and caring.  What happened to the doctor?</text>

My husband had to go 7-8  times for after illness  chemotherapy treatment result  and I only have had good experiences in this place . We were lucky to have this place in the area .  Excellent service (polite and fast) good doctors and nurses , secured , convenient access , amply parking .< /review>

NEGLIGENT with everything they do! They love to misdiagnose and refuse any accountability for their medical negligence. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS!! I was able to contact medi-cal to report fraud so this facility can not be paid ( for their medical negligence) - I also contacted the medical and nursing boards of California to open investigations on my behalf. Why should this place be paid for refusing accountability for negligently jeopardizing people’s health and lives ? Their medical negligence in misdiagnosing almost caused unnecessary death. Who is accountable ?  The state Boards, health department, and federal levels (OCR). Stand up for yours or your loved ones health since this place refuses to</Text>

Inland Medical is a NIGHTMARE!  Horrific treatment without regard to patient in pain!  We had over 6 hour wait, the lobby was literally empty, yet were told there were hundreds of people waiting!  My daughter was placed in a room without a hospital bed to rest her body in ER!  The room was not equipped for treatment!  She sat on hard chairs for hours.  Went in for dehydration was given the run around she wasn’t dehydrated!  When she asked for supervisor of the PA, who refused to have n Electrolyte Panel as well as blood work done, the PA went into a state of RAGE, called security to have have her removed from the tiny room!  We then proceeded to other side of lobby bc she asked for a real doctor.  Another long wait before she could be seen.
We were bullied by Security for hours who refused to give us a complaint form and continued to harass us in the lobby for no reason!

Then, we were exposed to Shingles via a room that was divided by a thin curtain!  Her condition is SERIOUS after getting a 2nd opinion!  The PA had discharged her without any tests, which would had resulted in serious conditions.

I don’t recommend this hospital to my worse enemy!!  MISDIAGNOSIS causes death!  PA diagnosed her w the FLU!<//Review>

I walked into inland Valley  medical center be
cause I am in pain. I have a pinched nerve in my neck as well as a history of spinal injure going back over 20 years. The clinic I go to for primary care has spent nearly  2 months (trying quote unquote) get a referral. The Female doctor there was anything but compassionate. I tried to tell the doctor my medical history and was told to stop,  she did not need to know my medical history. I was there 2 times for nerve pain and if you add up the days versus pills received it would equal less than one per day. The pill bottles say to take 1 pill every 6 hours as needed for pain. I was treated like a drug addict and told I was being flagged. I told them to keep there pain medication and fix me then. I won't be going back there at least without picket/protest signs. I am giving them notice at Inland  valley medical that if I ever am brought to there facility in a ambulance unconscious not to treat me because I'll consider it an act of assault. I'd rather bleed out than receive service from that facility again. My advice is that you are better off going to Tijuana, Mexico for your health care needs than this place.</Review>

<Text>My husband suffered a brainstem stroke last Aug 5, 2018. He was flown in to this hospital as it was the closest one to the bike trail that he was in.  The doctors and staff took great care of him. They acted fast, was attentive, compassionate, and did whatever they could to save his life.  We didn't know what state he would be in after recovery.  Today, by the grace of God, he is driving, working, and riding his bike again. Thank you so much to the ICU team, PCU team, and neuro doctors.  You guys saved my husband's life. You guys are second to none!< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went to ER with intense pain in my back near the shoulder blade area to under arm into upper front of chest. The pain had been present for at least a week and was not effected by physical or emotional stress.
Upon being brought back to visit ER DR I was given an EKG. The DR came in and asked a number of questions regarding my heart and family history of heart issues. Told him I had never had cardio issues but my farther pass at age 59 with a heart attack. I told the DR I had just completed a full cardio work up within the last few weeks. He asked exactly what did that mean because a cardio work up means different thinks. He asked if the work up had included an ultra sound, which I responded yes. I then asked him to listen to what I had to say about a stem cell injection procedure I had back in August which did not go well. He seemed reluctant to listen to what I was saying and kept his eyes downward as I explained what had happened. He then applied pressure to the top of my head and asked me to turn my head. When I turned my head to the left it cause the pain to increase. The DR then said I should make an appointment with my GP to have that addressed. DR said the ER was not there to address the issue relating to pain associated with my neck.  He then ordered a frontal chest X-ray and blood work. After he left the room a nurse (assuming she was a nurse could have been another DR) gave me 4 baby aspirin to take. It is also worth mentioning the DR asked me twice if I had ever had an angiogram. Which I had not. At this point it was obvious the DR had me on a heart attack protocol. which surprised me since my EKG and blood pressure were within the normal range.
After the X-ray and blood test I was sent back to the waiting room to wait for test results. The longer I sat there the more I realized my back pain was not going to be addressed. At that point I made the decision to leave the hospital without waiting on the test results. My logic was if I’m having a critical heart issue then the ER could call me. I was also very concerned the focus was on a heart condition and not what I was there to have address.
I believe the DR had a predetermined notion I was in some type of heart related stress and nothing was going to change his mind.
As of this writing my back is still in serious pain and my heart is doing fine. I would like to have a copy of the test (EKG, X-ray and blood) conducted while I was at the ER.
It’s very unfortunate this occurred and the DR went in a direction that was not addressing my painful condition.
Unless the test which were conduct resulted in showing a heart related issue associated with my pain I will address any billing with my insurance company.</Review>

I couldnt not walk and could barley stand yet no assistance was givin. I was in and then sent out swift ly and told I could go back to work in 2 days. (There testing/CT scan came back negative) So instead of looking at the severity of my immediate condition they made their decision based on what came back after CT and basic physical check.
I had been seriously sick going on 2 months. I had a 4th appointment with kaiser across the street but could not make it into the building..I had extreme vertigo/sensory over load so under the circumstances thought it best to get to the ER as directed by 2 kaiser employees at the entrance who saw my condition. IT was a Big mistake,  it was probably a worse situation to be in the ER. With the vertigo and sensory overload and lack of assistance since I could barely walk than to have just made my 10 oclock app. They would have just sent me to kaiser in Murrieta for the CT and I would have saved A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

It was really nice walking in and being treated right away. Being an asthmatic and having breathing issues at the time of my visit made it much less stressful knowing that I was being taken care of so quickly.< /text>

< review>
I was admitted to IVMC on Tuesday, March 10th. The ER doctors and nurses were attentive and thorough. However, when I was put in a room on the second floor, I felt ignored and lost in the shuffle. Amelia, the RN, was caring and Dr. Gentile was helpful. My course of treatment was to have my hip aspirated to try to determine why I’m having so much pain. I laid in the hospital bed for two days before they scheduled the aspiration and, I believe, that was only because I asked the charge nurse what I needed to do to transfer to another hospital (which I fully intended to do).

My gown was changed once in the four days, I wasn’t offered any type of sponge bath. I was never given a choice of meals and therefore, barely ate anything.

When I returned home, I noticed I have a skin rash on my back and underarms.

Also, I’ve been a volunteer at IVMC for almost ten years.

If I ever need to be hospitalized again, I will refuse to go to IVMC. There are at least three other hospitals in the Murrieta/Temecula area.</review>

<review>I am glad this facility has modern equipment but I feel they stap at the basic use of  old fashion tools like common knowledge, looking, asking questions, and using their experience.I came in with breathing problems.and I left with almost no air to go home. They lost my equipment.I asked for high flo liter canullas and only a few people knew about them. I use level 6 hi liter canuallas. I went home much later with your tank and it was returned the next day. This would be the second time in the past 3 years I have had oxygen problems.You have to treat us better.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

< Review>
dangerous place to come to for health coverage !!! Especially avoid the ED- they almost caused unnecessary death due to their negligent and unethical practices of misdiagnosing two times in one visit. They pride themselves in breaking HIPAA laws and love to discuss your private health while any one can hear it. There is certainly 0 accountability. I spent an hour on the phone yesterday trying to get to Jenn Lee the ED director, who I was told is on vacation until January 6- but if you check their facebook, this is a lie as they posted a photo of her today.

They will respond here with a link to contact them which was done MULTIPLE times without any following up.< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>My husband and I recently visited the ER after a fall. After having to wait  6 hours in a lot of pain, finally got an x-ray. He was then admitted and we encountered the worst hospital care you can imagine. They completely ignored the first 2 times you'd call on the call button every 20 minutes for a pain pill or IV machine that needed attending to and would beep incessantly.  Actually, it didn't seem to matter what you were calling for, they were all ignored.  After the second call, I finally went out to the nurses' station and met one of the rudest people I've ever met in my life.  She's the employee with gray hair that sits in front of a computer and answers all the calls from patients and people calling in to the hospital.  She completely ignored the fact that I was standing there requesting help. When I went closer to her so she was forced to look at me, she pretended she was deaf and still wouldn't look at me.  Completely inexcusable for anyone to treat anyone else so disrespectfully.

<text>Stayed with my dad in the hospital for three days. Never saw his attending physician. Never received a call. PT staff was fantastic and the only bright spot of the whole stay. They wanted to discharge him without proper prescriptions out of the weird assumption that we’d have all of them despite the fact that none of the conditions were pre-existing. Like most hospitals you really have to advocate on behalf of the patient or they just get lost.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Our 94 year old mother was taken here, and we were very impressed with the care and professionalism of the staff. They kept us informed of the issues related to her care, the doctors treating her in both the ER and in the hospital room took a good deal of time explaining what was going on, and answered and listened to our questions and concerns. The nursing staff were both caring and helpful. Highly recommend this hospital.<//text>

I was extremely disappointed in my ER visit, misdiagnosed and waiting in extreme pain for close to four hours for an x-ray we left. It was disturbing to watch the ER doctor just sitting and talking and laughing with staff while you’re waiting in pain.
The only reason that I did give 1star is because of the prescription for the Lidocaine patches they gave me on my way out.
I do not usually go to the ER unless I need to, maybe once a year if that, but to sit there in pain is inexcusable.</Text>

The nursing staff was very friendly when you saw them. Call lights not answered promptly or just hung up. The food is far from desirable. I had turkey serverd 3 different ways in 2 days. Never did they clean room nor did CNA come in. Only twice a day for vitals. If my surgeon worked out of a different hospital I would have tried there. Hats off to P.T and O T. The girls were.all awesome. Dont expect any kind of support from social service. If i could have gotten out of bed would have slapped her. She was of no help and very rude about it. Best in Inland Valley for hip and knee replacement. They do have all that going for them because of surgeons on board. Beware of aftercare. Today is day 3 and im home alone for 12 hrs. Because She wouldnt get me a bed in rehab.< /Text>

But when you ask for itemized statements they don’t make sense. Then you get a bill a year later saying it never got paid (SAVE YOUR EOB’S & RECEIPTS ) Riverside County Medical Services AMC they bill for the providers that see you at the hospital same thing their itemized statement don’t make sense. Almost like they are double dipping. Makes you wonder 🤔 if the providers know how horrible their billing services are or they don’t care.  Call your Insurance carrier prior to paying any statements to ensure they are complying with the agreement. The customer service for Riverside County Medical AMC is HORRIBLE!!! They say that they will process and take care of it and they don’t. You have to follow up 8-10 times within a year to ensure they did their jobs.</review><Date>1566530476814</Date>< Pictures>

I've been in the ER twice, and for the same thing (kidney stones *hurt*).  Both times they were not only prompt in seeing me and treating me, they listened to me and gave me the appropriate treatment without delay and with plenty of sympathy.  They also kept my husband with me.</text>

<review>The care was good but if you are un insured or under insured be prepared to essentially go bankrupt. I went to inland valley ER.  I was there for 4 hours. Got labs drawn, xray and sutures on my foot. I was in between jobs w no insurance. . I started recieving Bill's 2 months later totalling 19,000.00. Really,?  Unbelievable what this place charges. Never again.< /review><rate>3<//rate>< user_name>

I take my two year old child  here mostly but my man and I go as well when there is something wrong and they give the proper diagnosis and give the right prescriptions. I'm in and out in a timely matter. Its always clean. The staff are amazing and take your problems into consideration. I live 2 minutes from Hemet Valley Medical center.

I've been to this hospital along with Rancho Springs Medical (don't go there either) a lot due to being diagnosed with pulmonary embolisms. So that is very scary and my anxiety level is through the roof I've never had any medical problems or any medical issues ever since being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism's back in January with each and every little pain I was going to these hospitals because I was scared that I had another clot all I thought was I didn't want to die so I would go in and these doctors would just constantly do CT scans on me just to rule out a clot's.  Anxiety level is through the roof I've never had any medical problems or any medical issues ever since being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism's back in January with each and every little pain I was going to these hospitals because I was scared that I had another clot all I thought was I didn't want to die so I would go in and these doctors would just constantly do CT scans on me just to rule out a clot's.  I'm the patient I'm coming in and telling you that I don't feel well you're the doctor so you do what you feel is best.  This past Monday night I went to Inland Valley Pulmonary Specialist pain in my upper right quadrant underneath my rib cage radiating to my back it was about 9 PM. The ER doctor came to me and told me that I'm a frequent flyer there and I've had multiple CT scans and he did not feel I needed another CT for something unnecessary.  I explain my symptoms and my pain I told him that I've never felt this pain before I have nausea and vomiting throughout the week.  He said that I come in complaining of every little tiny pain so there's nothing really he could do for me and he sent me home!  I had my follow-up doctor appointment for the ER visit Friday my primary physician believes I have a gallstones and needs me to have an ultrasound or CT scan stat!!!!! I'm in so much pain, still she is very upset that they did not do anything at Inland Valley and I've been dealing with this pain for over almost a week!!! Always get a second opinion and try to avoid this hospital!!!<//review><user_name>Kristin Sizemore< /user_name>< rate>

<review>REVIEW OF STAFF PER MY ADMISSION AND TREATMENT ONLY!
Holy cow, I have never liked Inland Valley. I have driven to Temecula to go to THAT hospital before, just to avoid Inland. However I'm 32 weeks pregnant, and was having severe chest pains. My OB told me to go to the nearest ER and seeing as I had to drive myself, I wasn't about to risk making the trip to Rancho (where I'm set to deliver). As soon as I walked in, and they saw the belly, it was a side of Inland I've never seen. They got me admitted so fast I couldn't believe it. My nurse Stephanie was the NICEST, most attentive nurse I've ever had, and she was busy last night! But she made sure to check on me, brought me water, food, juice, helped me up when I needed, got me back down when I was done, and checked charts and tests when I was getting anxious to leave. The ultrasound tech was wonderful; they did an ultrasound to make sure my gallbladder was alright and then she showed me my baby just to make sure he's okay. The x-ray tech was so fast and made sure my babe was completely covered and protected. Stephanie took blood so quickly I didn't even realize it! And the doctor was kind, personable, and reassuring. Turns out I was just so magnesium deficient it could have caused the chest pain, so they filled me up via IV and sent me on my way with well wishes and good luck! Most people will only stop to write bad reviews, I know that. But the team last night deserves the highest praise. They treated me amazingly, they cared, and I'm so grateful.<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

The lady who checked me on could truly sympathize with how I was feeling because she herself had experienced a kidney stone before. The doctor that I dealt with. She went above and beyond helping me understand what I was going through and why. The nurse that gave me my shot, the nurse that checked me out, the sweet girl who did my ultrasound, and the other lady who did my x-rays all made me feel so comfortable. I have never had such an amazing experience at a hospital in my entire life. Thank you Dr. Jodie, James Bailey, Rachel  in ultrasound and the other 2 lovely  ladies I missed your names because of my pain.

Thank you security guard that walked me to my car and waited for me to drive away. I felt safe and secure. As there were a few loose cannons outside. I can't imagine what you all deal with on a daily basis.

The hospital was a little ran down, the chairs had cracks and tile old and in general could use some upgrades, but they provided hand sanitizer and masks and water for the people who are coming in so that was nice.

Everything smelt clean and after every patient I saw them wipe stuff down.

The staff all got along really well. I hope my next visit isn't anytime soon but if it is I hope I get this team again.</review>< pics>

The triage nurse greeted me quick, took my vitals and had me in a bed in no time. Took about 20 min to see the MD, which in an ER is nothing! Dr. Charukian, nicest man! He saw me had pain meds and my ultra sound ordered fairly quickly. The nurse started my IV and gave me pain meds. She was attentive when she saw i was still in pain and reported back to the MD. I wasnt the only patient there but they almost made me feel that way.
I got there about 4 am and discharged around 830am. Which if you have ever been in an ER is nothing. Triaged, seen, meds lab work and imaging ordered and done. I can't complain about my visit at all. I definitely wouldn't hesitate going back in an emergency.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<br/>
<br/>Long story short I was taken to the ER, given a CT, taken by ambulance to another hospital for another CT, then three separate sets of X-rays (because they screwed up the first time and two subsequent times after that).  Before I was admitted to my room, I was given regular treatment for my pain, and one last dose for the ride up to the room. I did not receive another treatment for 8 hours. I have compression fractures in 4 lumbar vertebrae. They never told me that my medication was on an as-needed basis and that I needed to ask. When I did ask, it took anywhere from 30-60 minutes to get treatment.
<br/>
<br/>After getting strung around all day the next day about when the doctor would release me, finally I told the charge nurse that I didn&#39;t feel safe at this facility. She told me &quot;I can&#39;t help how you feel&quot; and left the room.
<br/>
<br/>I am being held here against my will, and they won&#39;t release me to another facility.
<br/>
<br/>I don&#39;t feel safe at this hospital. I wouldnt send my parakeet here, let alone a friend or family member.<//text><user>110946950543058654545</user><date>1323753503193</date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Unless you are totally desperate - don't come here!!!  Totally misdiagnosed me!!!  Told me I had a 15% fracture of my back when in reality it was broke in two pieces (100%) with a huge chip out of it.  Got me confused with  another patient - ER nurse told me I wasn't paralyzed YET!!!  One doctor told me one thing, another told me something totally different.  Wanted to release me while I was having major issues because of insurance costs!!! Only one doctor seemed to know what was going on.....  this place sucks!
Then they threaten you with collections constantly - harass would be more like it.  So on top of my injuries I am panicked about coming up with thousands of $$$ that I know should be covered - then to find out when I call to make a payment that they actually owe me a REFUND!!!
If you have a choice - DO NOT GO HERE!!!<//Review>

I was charged over $4200.00 for the pleasure of sitting in the ER waiting room.  I was seen in the ER early this year. I was not examined by a doctor, a PA stuck her head in to say tests are being ordered. I  spent 98% of the time I was there in the waiting room or hallway. For that pleasure I was charged $4200.00! I received a separate Dr. bill for $2900 from a  Dr. I never saw or spoke to. All tests were itemized on top of these charges. Even with insurance I’m saddled with thousands $$ owing. The administration must be morally bankrupt to think this is an acceptable, fair practice. How does this align with the Hippocratic oath to “do no harm” ?<//review>

I've been in the ER at Inland Valley Hospital twice in the last three weeks; once for my mother-in-law who was in terrible abdominal pain.  Everyone there were wonderful & very attentive to her needs.  Yesterday, I had to take my sister into the ER who was badly bitten by a dog that morning.  All of the staff were great & she got the best treatment from them.  I'm very impressed & I don't impress easily.  Thank you to every body there.  You were the best!<//review>

I was at this facility about 2 year's ago in the ER.  IT WAS HORRIBLE!  Dr. In attendance was so arrogant, rude and soooooo unprofessional
My eye Dr uses this hospital for some of his surgeries I'm  nervous about this. Praying that practices as well as services have changed!</review>

<Review>If I could give them a zero I would. I'm lucky I'm alive today. Four nights ago after having outpatient surgery that morning elsewhere, the ambulance took me to this hellish place because I was losing consciousness, and a lot of blood. They stuck me in a room, drew some blood, And ignored me for the next seven hours while I lay there and bled  when my doctor contacted them to see what was going on, they said oh she's just whining because her garment is too tight. In the meantime I'm getting more and more damn fading in and out but I can still hear the cackle.  of the nurses station as everyone that works there what's talking about their diets, their dates vacations and how annoying patients are. My daughter went out at one point and asked please to get some help because her mom kept passing out and was bleeding too much and they told her to calm down and shut up or leave. Six or seven hours later I was released because my blood work came back with my blood levels on the high end of low which they wrote off as natural after surgery. Unfortunately I have been bleeding profusely for the following six or seven hours and I went directly to my surgeons office since he was now open. Upon arrival my blood pressure was 60/40. In medical terms I was almost dead.  Everything I was wearing was soaked in blood and when they tried to look it just squirted out of my body. I was rushed to Loma Linda emergency room where I was immediately taken in, blood drawn, attended to, and looked after. My bloodwork came back within a half an hour showing that I was severely anemic and had lost more than half of my blood. Though they were overcrowded and I said to stay in the emergency room I was still admitted immediately and put on whole blood.  It took five bags of blood to get my blood count back to normal and save my life. Had I not gone anywhere but Inland I would not be here to write that this right now.  I suppose if you have a broken bone or something it's OK to go there if you want to wait forever to be treated rudely. But, if there is anything seriously wrong with you stay away for your own sake< /Review><user_id>109507003169181328619</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I hope none of you or your loved ones find yourselves in association with this joke of a hospital. I will give credit the the handful of decent staff members that are employed there, HOWEVER the majority of the staff we have had to work with in nursing our loved one back to health has been a migraine on top of our many other headaches that brought us here. For this last week & counting we have had to rely on nurses who do not respond to the call for assistance in a timely fashion, who leave those who cannot tend to themselves for half an hour on the john, who do not respond to calls for change of soiled linen, who do not handle the patients with the kind & courteous manner that the hospital feins to represent & has posted in every room. If you can, do all in your power to stay away.< /text><user>104445403172311057186< /user></record></dataset><record>

This hospital is a joke! My husband cut his fingers on an engine fan blade. I took him straight to ER as one finger was sliced straight down the center! Not only was there NO sense of urgency, it took an hour of waiting in the waiting room in ER just to be checked in. My husband was bleeding like crazy that people in there were willing to give up their spots so he can go ahead of them and be seen...the nurse at check in wouldn’t allow it!!!! Then after check in, we are finally taken into a room for clean up and stitches. It took 3 hours of sitting in the room before the doc came in to do 13, yes 13 stitches in 3 of my husbands fingers. It was a total of 6 hours we were there. My husband has permanent damage because it too so long to get him fixed AND they didn’t even finish and dress the injury properly and he got an infection. Took him to my favorite urgent care to be fixed up. I will never go back and they are lucky I didn’t file a lawsuit!</text>

Nobody's around when I needed help all day 3/7 Tuesday. I asked for help to use commode, Noah came after a long wait, he helped me out of my bed, proceeded to leave me the rest of the time. I had to walk over to the trash can by the wall to throw away wipes into the trash can with the help of a walker myself, got in my bed myself without any help. I even had to wait 50 minutes to get pain pill, I asked Connie @ 5:55pm, had to asked 3 more times before Bonnie showed up @ 6:45. By then, my pain level has escalated from 3/4 to 7/8. These r just 2 examples today.
The staff today certainly r not trained well & insensitive, no empathy toward helpless patients.
The patient next to me, 233A, is complaining too. But, I'll let her do her own talking !<//Review>

Was butchered here. I reached out and tried to talk to the administration over and over. Filled out forms. No follow up. No calls. No results. I asked around town, and apparently this place should be torn down and the admin all arrested for negligence. Never seen a medical place, anywhere in any 3rd world country act this way and have such a horrible reputation in town. Every single person I have encountered has said similar. Let's start on a class action lawsuit. The hospital can call me if they'd like to talk but have given them many opportunities to do so.... who is with me? Let's take them out!!!! They don't deserve to hurt more people. F U Dada.<//text>

Do not go to the ER unless you are 100% sure you need the ER. I was there for no more than 2 hours and most of the time was spent in the waiting room. I seen the doctor about 10 minutes total and I was billed 3 seperate bills. One for the doctor fees, one for the hospital, and one for the lab. The bills totaled almost 3 grand. Yes I have insurance and depending on the type of insurance you have, depends in your pay out of pocket portion but that amount of money is excessive. The doctor alone charged 947 dollars for 10 minutes. I paid 2 grand to sit on a chair in the lobby. I am going to ask for an itemized statement of how they came up with that amount. AGAIN that's excessive!< /Text>

We've come back because all his information is here so it is usually just convienet. Well this last visit he was taken to X-ray room and another nurse came out and called his name we explained he had already been taken. Less than 5 minutes later the same male nurse comes back and calls him again we inform him he is still in X-ray he rolls his eyes and throws up his hands and says "Well I was told he returned so" You are treated like a chore to them. You either get an amazing nurse or one who could care less.

<Review>They treated my fiancé well enough. However this is noisiest hospital I have ever been in. Nurses yelling and laughing down the halls, constant banging and noise all day and night.

Part of healing is rest and sleep and it was hard to get either in the 5 days she was there.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168<//Gmap_id><Time>1473209355725< /Time>< Pictures>

<Review>I've been to all local area hospitals ER's and have never had a negative experience.  The most recent visit was last month, had to take the husband for an on-going knee issue.  It was about 10pm, were had just came from San Diego and I did not want to go into Riverside to Kaiser.  We opted to go to Inland Valley and pay the co-pmt.   They treated him, we were in and out in under an hour.  The Dr. was honest and frank about the medications she was prescribing and overall it was a good experience.  Best money I spent.  The additional hours it would have been going into Riverside, waiting at Kaiser, drive time etc. definitely outweighed the $60.00 fee.</Review>< Pics>

For starters everyone who works here has a serious attitude problem and is very rude. My buddy was in a 4 wheeler accident and the first hospital we took him to did an ultra sound and said that he needed to go to the truma hospital because he had fluid lines on his spleen. At the Inland Valley Medical Center they told him that no bones are broken ( it is clear that he has a separated shoulder) , you have some internal bruising and it is clear something is wrong with his shoulder but we don't do MRI's here so we are going to release you and you can go find somewhere else to get one. All around terrible docs terrible staff. There were 3 other people that were there when we showed up and they all were having problems with not getting the proper treatment and staff being disrespectful and rude.<//review>

Visiting family- I came to inland valley this afternoon to visit a family member on the second floor. Accompanied by my wife LAPD  retired officers whom  was exceptional happy she was required to provide her ID and issued a visitor badge before access was granted for her to enter the facility. She even told the security guard kinda heavy set guy she was comfortable providing her identification card at which time he re assured her , her Information was only limited to captioning her picture and  full name only to provide full safety of her loved one while in the care of the facility. My wife  is employee by a law enforcement agency and was very impressed by the security personnel at the facility as they are not normally aware of there environment and the threats which are possible. The security personnel she interacted with was extremely professional and  even told her, her if she needed  further assistant while she was here on site at the facility to give him a call or  ask any security personnel for additional assistant.  I am not trying to make sometime out of nothing but we have recently been to  the hospital in hemet and were only left with a ER window and the a waiting room before 45 minutes had passed and someone assisted us. My wifes mother  is doing well very thankful for the   medical staff here as well.< /Text>

I'm So Disappointed With Most Of The Staff In The ER Department, From My Last Visit Yesterday. I Have Been Here Many Times In The Past And Have Never Experienced The Kind Of Rude, Passive,  Unprofessional Attitude's From Any Of The Nurses Or Security Staff That I Have Encountered Before Yesterday's Visit. The Doctor, Male Nurse That Assisted My Doctor, My Insurance Registration Lady And X-Ray Technician Were Thee Only 4 People Who Were Nice To Me At All During My Visit(Time)Yesterday, While I Couldn't Walk Because My Foot Hurt So Bad From A Horrible Fall And It Ended Up Being Broken In 2 Places. I Couldn't Believe That The Triage Nurse Was So Unhappy, She Didn't Even Welcome Anyone By Saying Please Wait Over There Or Good Morning, There Were No Smiles, Even While I Was Trying To Walk On Crutches Outside, The Nurses Walking Outside Didn't Have Smiles Either. The Security Guard Seemed To Have Something Personal Against Me, Even The Kind X-Ray Tech Apologized On Behalf Of Him. He Had Me Moving Around Everywhere, Telling Me To Sit In An Exact Chair In The Waiting Room When There Were Only 4 Separate Families There In A Huge Empty Waiting Room And I'm Trying To Walk With Crutches,  Where He Wants Me To Sit, In Pain And As Soon As I'm Ready To Sit He Says Loudy, "Not In That Chair,"A Few More Down....It Doesn't Matter, I Was Already On The Other Side, (not to be triaged-checked in). Only This Security Guard Kept Being Rude With Me And I Felt Bad Because I Kept Saying Good Morning To Everyone With A Smile On My Face, Even Though I Was In A Tremendous Amount Of Pain. It Was A Horrible Display Of Professionalism And Coming From A Managerial Position In The Medical Field, It's Really Sad To See That! The Last Thing Patient's Want When They Don't Feel Good, Is To Be Treated Un Kind, It Makes Everything Else You're Going Through, Feel So Much Worse! If You're Not A People Person, If You Don't Like To Talk, If You Don't Want To Be Helfpful, If You Arent Patient, Then Especially, Please Do Not Be A Nurse, It Takes Very Sincere And Special People To Do The Job Of A Nurse! I Hope That I Won't Need Another Visit Anytime Soon And That Maybe This Particular Day And Group Of Nurses-Staff Was Just An Off Day For Them, For Everyone's Sake.  Anyhow, This Was My ER Visit At Inland Valley In Wildomar.</text>

Told the doctor that my chest was hurting and I couldn't breathe took them 45 minutes to get me a breathing treatment then finally I can talk
I can tell the nurses don't know what they're doing, and the doctors are filled with pride and ego, to the point to where they rather be wrong then make you right
They x-rayed my chest and the doctor says he's seen a little infection I asked him for antibiotics he refused... instead prescribed me prednisone which I told him I have negative response to that and that it would make me gain weight and he suggested that it wouldn't
4 weeks later I come back I'm really in bad condition it has worsened since the last time I was there same symptoms this time I have no capacity to even talk
X-ray my chest and once again tried to tell me well I still see a little infection I demanded he prescribed me antibiotics and not steroids
Because the steroids they prescribe for me put an extra 15 lbs on me... and I gained weight from the prednisone the last time they prescribed them and it put dark spots on my face... this time my back and my neck gain weight from the prednisone
After taking the antibiotic prescribed I can now Breathe No More chest pain no more mucus why didn't he prescribed this for me in the first place what is going on with these doctors and their pride it's all about the patients getting well or am I wrong???</review>

l suffer from chronic pain. l have cervical spinal stenosis and scoliosis. l have had cervical surgery 2-7. The first time l the paramedics brought me there l was told l could get no pain meds until a family member got there. My pressure was 210/106 l ask for something to bring my pressure down l was given NOTHING. l called until l got in touch with my brother in law who lives in Los Angeles . l had to wait two hours because of traffic. There was a lady there with a family member who was a nurse at another hospital who was my voice to get something to bring my pressure down.  NOT A VERY GOOD DAY. The second time my stepdad brought me in ,my pain was a 10+ . l was told because of the medication l requested l was told l was there for a quick fix and l needed to go home. My stepdad is a Pastor and l Have never heard him raise his voice. He has to be loud just to be heard l tried to explain that l am in the state data base, but no one would. After about ten minutes a nurse recognized me from my last visit. The doctor that was on call that evening was a real PRI... Nobody should be treated like that.

Not a good place for anyone who cannot communicate needs. Patients who need turning are left to develop horrible bed sores. This has happened to many elderly patients who could have gone home had this not happened. My friend got stage 4 bed sores (to the bone) this was a death sentence to her. Caused only by neglect. Also no personal care is done for patients. And the place is not very clean. Our nickname for this hospital is “ Death Valley”<//text>

I had a pleasant experience (as pleasant as can be expected when being injured). I was taken here after crashing hard at Lake Elsinore MX. Knocked out completely with a little bleeding on the brain and 4 broken ribs. Nurses were very attentive and nice. Especially Marissa. Also Tay, Melissa, and Kat. They came in every hour on schedule to check me, made me comfortable and were expedient when time came for me to leave. Food wasn't all that great but it's hospital food, what do you expect? Not exactly a hospital regular, but I am assumong it could have been much worse. Remember, most people only comment when something doesn't go well so there are probably a lot of good experiences here that were not posted. Kinda like the person that gives a nice hotel one star because they forgot a towel.</text>

what kind of torture chamber is this?
expect a 1-2 hour wait for your "emergency"
the PA nearly laughed at me for coming in.  He said they can't fix me, but I have to go to ortho.  I was told by ortho that they can't fix me, I have to go to the ER.  So I get nothing, again!!

The WORST HOSPITAL you can go to.  I had a kidney stone and they left me in my room for one hour and half with out any pain medication.  I was moning and no one I REPEAT no one came to my room.  Also there is a nurse SHANNON (EMERGENCY) BEWARE of her, as she is the ruddest most unprofessional nurse with no ETHICS you will ever have.   GOD SAVE YOU if you end up there!<//Review>
