<GmapID>0x808579e123c39ccb:0xa216b7fc49e7b877</GmapID><Review>I recently moved from California to Oregon and needed a fast, reliable, reasonably-priced and professional long -distance moving company and was referred to OCD Moving Services by a co-worker who had just moved to the same area I was headed to. I looked online at their reviews and then started to do some comparing, and everything I found about OCD beat the competition every time. The perfect review score made it easier, too.

The OCD crew I had was exactly what you want out of a team of movers. Danny, Brian, Jose G and Joseph were kind, professional, careful, and efficient. They had the challenge of moving our 3 story townhouse including an extremely fragile and expensive TV and they handled it perfectly. Everything showed up in perfect shape and on time, and they even helped me put the TV and the stand back together so we could test the TV before they left, and they also went as far as putting furniture pads on everything we placed on the new laminate flooring of our home.

Just to mention it too: Daniel, who owns the company, is very responsive and helped us get a perfect moving date locked in. All around, the customer service aspect is above par.

If you're looking for a team of movers, you've found them. The next time I move, if I can, I'll be using OCD Moving Services.<//Review></record>

<review>OCD Moving Services is awesome! They recently moved us for the 3rd time, and we could not have been more pleased. Every employee is polite, professional, conscientious and hard working. Now with Covid, they adhere to strict safety protocols which we truly appreciated. It is enjoyable to observe how well they work as a team and support each other. We have never experienced any issues or damage through any of our moves. While we hope this will be our last move for many years to come, we would definitely use OCD again when that time comes. We highly recommend their services.< /review>< Pics>

Everyone on this team was exceptional! At the last minute we had some uncertainty about the timing of when we would get the keys to the new spot and they were flexible and understanding which eased our stress... They worked efficiently and effectively, taking good care of all our items large and small... It so happened that one of the staff was an old neighbor and that made it even more awesome! Thank you so much for making the move so smooth for us - the positive attitude, team work, and professionalism was outstanding! Really appreciate it and highly recommend you to anyone!</text>

We had OCD move all of our heavy and bulky furniture, along with numerous packed boxes and totes, into a POD. Daniel, the owner, was easy to work with, the crew was on time, wrapped everything very well, worked efficiently, and did a much better job packing the POD than we ever could. The price was certainly reasonable for the quality of the work we received. If we didn't have to store most of our items, we probably would have hired OCD to do our out of state move. These guys are great, and I would use them again.<//text>

<text>After a couple of awful moving experiences, I knew from the first phone call that OCD Moving would be the polar opposite. They could not have been more on top of my move, timely, helpful, respectful, and completely skilled and professional at the job. They were on time, right on their estimate, and took care of my fragile and antique furniture like it was theirs. A special shout out to Jake and MJ who were masterful on the delivery end. I am a real customer, and the good reviews are from customers they turned into fans like me because of their pride in a job well done.<//text></record>

<text>I moved with OCD two weeks ago and they were amazing! Spoke with Daniel on the phone to book and he was very communicative and laid out the pricing clearly. It was very fair, great deal! Jake and Joseph were the guys that helped me with the move and words cannot describe how fast, professional, and efficient they were. Moved a 2 bedroom house into an elevator-less 3rd floor apartment in 4 hours. They were hustling! During the move, they made sure to communicate a great deal with me as to what I wanted and I never had to repeat myself and they didn't forget a single thing. Would highly recommend and would definitely use again. Bonus: they wore masks and followed all COVID-19 guidelines!<//text>< pics>

<Text>Very responsive and hard working team members helped move us from a large house to a larger home. It was a long job and they worked tirelessly to get it done right - taking it to a full 12 hour day with little breaks. They had sufficient materials to fill the gaps were we did not pack well or were short on boxes. All the men were extremely warm and friendly. Most of all I was impressed with how much these guys can lift!<//Text>< Pictures>

Best low stress move ever! Will use again. Have recommended OCD to others even those not planning a move. (Everyone always wants to know a good mover). Pricy but worth the money. Really nice team on job. Stuff I wasn't sure I wanted to keep but didn't want to lose, (a cat tree for the hypothetical next pet), they suggested moving to garage. One mover was happy to get an old soundbar.  Same for a new platform for a bed which didn't work out. It was nice to have something gratefully reused that I thought would have to be junked. They moved a complex bed that had been dismantled by the makers the day before move to get it out of the bedroom. Moved the pieces w/o a scratch and easily followed builders instructions to partially reassemble for sleep until builders could return Monday 😊< /Text>

Jacob and Joseph were efficient, friendly, and very careful with all of our things. As if their job wasn't difficult enough, we had to move during shelter-in-place, so they helped us do some serious heavy lifting while also wearing masks and gloves for safety. They were amazing! We appreciated their help very much. Thanks again!!<//Review>

<text>OCD Moving Services moved my husband and me to Vancouver, Washington from the Bay Area very successfully. Really. Everything arrived, on time, with no threat of "extra" costs or hold ups. The guys were all friendly and hard-working.

So when I needed to move my mother up here to a facility, I called them up, and we had a reprise of the same great treatment. Dan worked with me to find a great price. The guys were friendly and hard-working. Everything arrived, on-time, no threat of "extra" costs or hold ups.

I've recommended them to the real estate agents currently putting my mom's house on the market, knowing that they would only recommend a great service.

OCD moving crew was very professional and respectful for my mom's knick knacks and ALL her plants. Crew appearance was very professional and matching. Trucks are professional looking. Entire crew was appreciative as well and very understanding and accommodating with our hectic moving timeline. Husband was an ex-mover and was blown away how professional everything was from the people, equipment, and attitudes. OCD moving service was definitely worth every penny and will refer to whomever asks. They have a great crew.< /Review>

The packers were excellent! They put blankets on our furniture then shrink wrap it. That is all furniture! They took real good care of my stuff that I could see because it was placed in storage. I would recommend them to anyone!<//review>

Have moved 21 times in adult life. OCD was head and shoulders above any other moving company. Required multiple days spread out with packing, an array of furniture swaps and storage needs. Every item landed exactly where it was suppose to. Their level of communication and asking questions along the way reflected their impressive level of professionalism and customer oriented focus.< /text>

<text>They were very professional. Our move was smooth and no damage. Our full size upright piano was very heavy and they took very good care of it. The best movers that we ever had. Highly recommend if you want a smooth and damage free move.</text>< name>

I have moved a lot in my lifetime. Dealing with OCD is a bit of a different experience than dealing with other moving companies.
Daniel is extremely responsive and makes it as easy as possible through the process. I have moved with them twice - once out of state. I referred good friends to them as well. our friends had multiple stops, delivering furniture to a few different addresses, etc., these guys worked a really long day and were still pleasant and patient.
The guys doing the actual move were all great. They work so efficiently together, have a sense of humor and genuinely like each other.
I would recommend OCD to anyone, whether it’s a small or large move.< /Review>

If you need to move OCD Moving is it! We hired OCD to move from California to Oregon. I couldn't have been happier!
These people are professionals. They were always on time. Friendly crew. Wore masks. During the time leading to the move I was getting nervous and called Daniel 3 times. (It was the 4th of july weekend.) He answered the phones and made me feel comfortable and assured me the mould would be perfect. It was. They wrapped delicate furniture, they handle a special piece of equipment with care. Nothing broke, nothing arrived damaged. They informed us of anything that required attention. They were on their toes 100% of the time. The move just went flawless! Hire these people, you will not be dissapointed. Pablo< /Review>

OCD Moving showed up right on time and didn't waste time moving. All three men that helped us were very nice and courteous. They joked with us as we were finishing packing up the last few things to move. They even went above and beyond and put my mother-in-law's couch back in the house after taking ours out. They were so helpful. When we got to our new place and they rolled out the red carpet to keep the floors clean and were very communicative about where all the boxes went. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone and will use them again the next time we move.< /text>< Pictures>

OCD team, where do I begin... The most organized, clean, literally OCD team I have ever used for my moving. We moved to Los Angeles with their help, and I can not thank them enough for all their help. From packing to moving our cars, they have over delivered. Great prices too. We cannot thank you enough.

<Review>These guys are the best. I hired them for 2 small jobs that required a lot of heavy lifting. First was moving a 600lb (not exaggerating) piece of industrial furniture, the other was moving a top heavy, awkward 425lb industrial pump. They showed up on time, were very careful to avoid damage, and were very courteous. Scott, Dustin, and Daniel are stand-up guys and I'd definitely recommend OCD to anyone in need of a good mover.</Review><response>{'time': 1573675160384, 'text': 'Thank you Sir!\nDaniel'}<//response><Date>1573668219585< /Date>< Gmap_id>

On Friday 1-25-19 l used OCD Moving Services. I don’t know where to begin. This company is such a exception. From beginning to end. They are so professional, you would think they were caring for there own property. They were like my own family moving me out of state. This crew from John, Ronnie, Ion, Joe and Mike.Nothing was damaged. This group of employees got along with each other, you could tell they were actually friends not just coworkers. Now for the owner Daniel, he was such a nice organized person. Who treated his employees with the same respect he wanted. Honestly I can’t say enough good things about this experience. Just THANK YOU, to all of you.
I would refer OCD in a heart beat.   Tomi<//text>

Best moving company hands down, micheal and his crew had great attitudes and came ready to work. They showed up on time and early.
Took them about 1-2 hour to load up a 26 foot moving truck, THATS IMPRESSIVE! That includes a 6 person couch, dressers and 100lb king bed and ALOT of boxes. They were courteous, professional, spoke fluent english, hard working, and truly cared about our stuff. Everything they moved and handled was taken in with great care as if it was their own stuff.
Daniel was great and flexible, we were able to set up a process of payment through my employer.

The price was reasonable and would choose them again every time.

Thanks OCD moving!!</text>

OCD Movers were excellent from beginning to end!! We started with a limited window of time, but Daniel and all his workers were able to get everything done on time, from the estimate to the finished move, with great attitudes and way more energy than we could keep up with!! They dealt with our junk and messes with grace and humor, and accomplished in 2 days what we just could not get done. What a weight off our shoulders..... what a gift to have these young healthy bodies able to tackle what our old crippled bodies just can't do anymore!!! AND for thousands of dollars less than a previous estimate!! You just can't beat OCD Movers!!! 5 stars all around for OCD Movers!!!</text>

<review>OCD Moving Services helped me with two moves: transitional shorter distance, and final longer distance.

The business owner-estimator was prompt, professional, answered follow-up questions, and provided an accurate estimate.

The moving crew was terrific: on-time, fit, experienced, protective measures for belongings, effecient time management, helpful, cordial & professional.

OCD Moving Services made my moving experiences stress-free.  I highly recommend them.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1547231906432, 'text': 'Thank you so very much Sharon!'}<//response>< GmapID>

Had a group of 3 movers who came early ready to go.  They were all very friendly and took great care with our belongings.  You could tell they knew what they were doing, and they worked well together to stay efficient.  I would use them again.  In fact my mom is moving in the near future and we’re hoping to request the same crew for that move as well.< /Review>

John and John from OCD Moving Services were awesome! They are so friendly and communicated throughout the move, always wanting to make sure that you are satisfied with what and how they are moving things. We have a big piano and we were going to hire "piano movers", but they got the piano into the truck in about 60 seconds. If I ever move again, I'll definitely call them up. They also have a "can move anything" approach, which is great.</Review>

OCD was awesome. They showed up and we weren't nearly as prepared as we should have been. They were patient, worked around us and did an amazing and efficient job. I could not recommend them enough strictly based on service alone, but knowing how economical it was to boot...the value simply can not be beat. Thank you to Daniel and all of the crew.</review>

While preparing a studio apartment for a move across the country, I was lucky to get matched with OCD’s Pasquale, the prodigy of placement of possessions in pods! Pasquale and his delightful partner Mike, in the span of less than 2 hours, were able to get everything efficiently and safely situated. Things that I thought I would have to leave behind miraculously fit. Before you decide to do it yourself, think again and hire this company!

<review>Excellent movers! Arrived on time, drove our furniture to the new location and unloaded everything (up three flights of stairs!) with no complaints. Once the job was done, the final price was still within the estimated price range. My husband and I were very happy with their service, we wouldn't have been able to do it without them.<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< date>

Awsome service and correspondence. The rates are among the lowest and their service are among the best.  Movers were great and worked hard and wasted no time in doing their job. I have moved a lot and i can testify to their high quality and great rates by experience.< /Review>

Daniel and his crew rocks. They moved us twice. I don't care how picky you are.. I guarantee that I am more picky. These guys got all of our expensive computer, stereo, TV equipment and furniture / artwork without a mark on any of it. Everything was expertly packed..

Daniel (owner/manager) was personally there to over see the move. I thought that their prices were fair considering how good of a job they did. I even trusted these guys when my mom needed a mover.. and she is literally OCD (ha ha) when it comes to her stuff. One scratch and she would have a nuclear melt down. Well, it never happened.. these guys moved her stuff flawlessly.</review>

<text>I couldn't recommend OCD highly enough.  Daniel was a consummate professional from start to finish.  He visited our house a few days before the move in order to explain their process, offer suggestions for packing, etc. and to arrive at an accurate estimate.  Daniel and his crew worked quickly, but were also very careful and thoughtful throughout the move. They ultimately completed the job under their estimate.  In addition, all the guys were a pleasure to work with.  By far the best moving experience we've ever had.  We anticipate moving again within the next two years and will definitely be calling OCD.<//text>< Pics>

We used OCD Moving Services moving from El Cerrito to Denver metro. Daniel was extremely communicative and responsive. Everything was laid out clearly up front - no surprises. Josh was the leader of our move - he packed - drove and unpacked. Josh was great. He arrived on time, was polite and nothing was broken. He even provided updates on his travel to Denver from CA so we knew exactly where he was. Fully recommend them for your move!</Text>

I used OCD Moving Services for my move from Emeryville, CA to Fargo, ND a few months ago.  I paid extra for the complete pack and move service.  I have moved many times over the years, and I have to say that this was the best move ever.  ALL of my furniture and belongings arrived in great condition and everything was on time.

OCD SAVES THE DAY
After a useless cross country mover (Platinum Relocations out of Tampa, Florida ) didn't  get my things into the house because of the driveway steepness (that they had been told about and were sent photos) and I had to put everything into storage I contacted OCD. They were prompt, responsive and supportive at a time when I was super stressed and frustrated with all the damage and mess the cross country movers caused. OCD assessed the situation and calmly went about getting me moved in. I called them on Tuesday night and they fit me into their schedule and got it all accomplished by Thursday afternoon.
I have moved cross country multiple times and OCD is by far the best!
Thank you guys!< /Review>

OCD was careful with our belongings, efficient with their loading and off-loading, and courteous to put everything exactly where we wanted. Also, the final bill was less than he originally quoted. I will definitely call them back next time I move.<//Review>

The service was fast, efficient and great pricing.  I needed some furniture to be picked up and delivered to my house, and OCD came to the rescue with same day service.  No issues or complaints.  The communication was great via phone calls and text.  Thank you OCD!</Text>

I hired them to move from a 4th floor condo in a complex with a broken elevator and poor street access.   No problem! Daniel organized the move,  including the transport of fragile artwork, with awesome attention to detail.  He communicated clearly,  and timely responded to my questions   Happily, the elevator was working on move day, and it all flowed well.  His team was professional, prompt, personable and on-the-spot problem-solvers. And,  he refinished  the top of an antique wood chest that had gotten scratched in the move.  He picked it up, repaired it, and returned it  in better condition than it had ever been!   Will absolutely use them again< /review>< Name>

Daniel thankfully was able to schedule 2 guys to load my things on a truck on extremely short notice.  I wasn't able to be at the site, so Josh kept in contact with me by phone. He very obviously knows his profession and was able to make me feel secure in knowing that they were doing a good job. I truly appreciated his communication with me. I only wish I had known about OCD Moving Services before I made some packing blunders - as Josh said, "We're a full service moving company." I have moved out of the area or I would have certainly used them again. My only hope is that this review will serve as a good referral for someone, like me, who has no idea who to trust.<//review>

<Review>I've never used a moving service before, so I am not able to compare OCD with other companies, but I could not recommend OCD more highly. I wish I could give them six stars. This was a nerve-wracking move for me, going from my home of 18 years Oakland to Sacramento where I don't know anyone (moving for a job), and I basically only had one day to pack my one-bedroom apartment, so I was only about 85% ready when OCD arrived. The OCD guys (3 guys, TJ, Pasquale, and John K., the team leader) arrived 10 min. early and started working while I and my friends finished packing. This end of things took about an hour longer than the estimated time. Now, the apartment building where I was moving in Sacto has a policy where you have to pay $40/hr for a security guard while you are moving in. The OCD guys had been doing a great job moving my sometimes odd and haphazardly packed items, going at a steady pace, constantly communicating about where I wanted things, on target for expected timing on the load out, not slow or fast. Then, at 5:30 the security guard said he had to leave at 6 or he'd have to charge me time and a half. John said he'd never heard of a tenant having to pay to move into a place, and was (I felt, on my behalf) upset to hear I'd be charged extra. He and his crew put on the rocket boosters and finished up an hour's worth of unloading in 30 minutes. Their display of commitment to customer service and effort to minimize my costs was remarkable. I am so grateful to Daniel for his good (and reassuring) communication in advance of the move, and to John K., TJ and Pasquale for their stellar work moving my household. They made a difficult move go as smoothly as possible.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This company sets the bar for moving companies! From the first phone call for a quote from Daniel to the actual one-day move from Benicia CA to Southern Oregon a week later with John and Pasquale, I received nothing less than stellar service. Their price was more than fair, they were on time and they took incredible care with my belongings. I’ve never felt so much that my movers cared personally about ensuring that I was unquestionably satisfied with each aspect of my move. I hate moving, but  if there is a shining light to be found when you HAVE to relocate, it’s OCD Moving Company. I recommend them to EVERYONE. Thank you for an easy, perfect move. You guys rock!!!<//Text>< rate>

I am not the type of person that likes complaining or giving bad reviews but sometimes that is the last resource you are left with. The food is not the issue here but their customer service. We have been there only three times. The first time we were a big group so we didn't mind it took a bit long to get served. The second time it took about 15-20 for someone to approach us and offer menus and drinks, again we didn't mind since we were having a nice conversation. We were 4 adults. The las time it was tonight 09/27/19. Oh my, tonight was the worst. I do want to make clear that we did notice they were understaffed. Anyways, we waited for 20 minutes without anyone even acknowledging we were there. I see the waitress and ask her for menus, she said give one minute, 10 minutes passed and she didn't approached us, my brother asks again and she finally approaches. She tell us with an attitude, "I am understaffed, I don't have any menus and I have other tables. At this point we say ok, we stand up and start to leave, she says whatever and approaches another table and asks; have you been helped? My family is already at the door but that made me mad so I asked if there are any business cards, she turns around and says no. We do not work with business cards. I say ok, can you tell me your managers name? She answers, she is not here today and you don't need to call her. At this point I can see she is upset and starts to get defensive telling me she already explained she is understaffed and busy. I tell her, I understand and that she does not need to raise her voice, to calm down. She starts talking over me to tell me again she is busy, understaffed etc etc. At this point everyone is looking at us and the last thing I tell her before walking out is. I understand honey, we are leaving not because we waited for too long but because you didn't even acknowledge us, not even to let us know that you saw us, to let us know you were busy and that you were going to be with us as soon as if was possible for you. I walked out after that. The reason we are never going back is the fact that she didn't even looked at us once before I approached her the first time and that was after 20 minutes of being sitting there.<//text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>My husband and I have been there 3 times. The first time they were about to close and we ordered 2 Vampiros each. They were served nicely but in a toasted store bought tortilla. The second visit my husband ordered 1 vampiro and it was served in a hand made tortilla. I ordered a Molcajete Sinaloense and it was pretty good I'll give them that. The third time the owner was not there and there were only 2 women attending the kitchen. My husband asked for some shrimp with rice and beans(he didn't like it) I asked for guacamole and was told they didn't have aguacates. But I see different plates coming out the kitchen with aguacate slices, like wth? So I asked for a vampiro and they took forever and a day only  to then find out that the tortilla wasn't even toasted, it was like if I asked for a big taco! Never going back again. Making food FOOD is not their forte.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Excellent and affordable service has always been my experience at A Transmission.
I've been coming here for about 8 years and the end result is always top notch.
This establishment is the ONLY choice for your ailing auto needs.

<review>I have been coming to this shop for approximately 10 years  or longer now and have been satisfied with their work. They’ve work on not only my old cars but also new cars. Friendly, honest, fair price (and I have gotten other opinions from other shops) 100% trust this shop!!!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d70cf8ec7d03:0x1d6fd602194f535d< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
Took the car in for a leaky transmission, didn't get a call to confirm what was wrong or that they even started diagnosing my car, I called them the next week and they told me the car was done and that I needed to pay 950 bucks because they had to replace a pump and the torque converter, without my consent! I needed the car so I paid and before I even got home, I noticed a lock rattling/knocking noise and took it back where they had it a couple more days. Fast forward to a week later and I'm overheating and I see that my hoses are halfway pushed on and the few that were on all the way didn't have the clamps on at all. Now I'm at another mechanic having to have them fix these guys' mistakes. DONT GO HERE< /Review>

they have assisted me 3 times in a moment of need. They rebuilt my transmission,  and a week later replaced my engine on my 2003 Toyota Solara, which are a little rare right now. Their work was impeccable and I'm driving an old car that is humming like it doesn't know it's 17 years old< /review>

I went in because of check engine light. I was told the repair was expensive so I was better off getting a reconstructed transmission. I thought it was a scam so I went to other places for other opinions including the one you see and hear on media, you know the one with the double A and a  honk honk. I was astonished on how expensive the repair was. I quickly went back to A transmission. I am very happy I went in to this place. The owner is very nice and helps people out. The job came with a 1 year worry free warranty guarantee.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<username>Bob Myers</username><text>Two times ago I had problems with this shop. George is awesome but again this time when I got home I had grease on my hood grease all over my door and grease all over inside my car. I did show George this problem he took care of it right away. He does help people with good prices BUT this should never happen. I did spend 400.00 dollors to get my car fixed. I really hate putting this out there but SOMEBODY is not watching or checking the cars when done. Not happy with this shop but George has a big heart.<//text></record>

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This place is suck, no trust, don't believe what they tell you.
I had a buick transmission shifting will have a little jump.
They charge me $ 800 and I back there for more than 5 times.
They also told me is the transmission software problem.
They told me to bring the car to dealer to re programming the transmission software and upgrade.
i spent another $ 200 for the dealer, but the problems still there, just like before .

<Review>Just ordered 4 sushi rolls last night.  Very delicious as always.  Friendly service when I went to pick up my order.  Side salad is very good, I do wish I asked for extra salad dressing.  The kids enjoyed the California rolls. My family and I will continue to get our sushi from here.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVS0BTvJzYmPTvVDH-foSqVzmE-dyBWD2RZ6ab=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c32c9216ab72eb:0xe40b43ecb9c8cbfa< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

First time meeting the owner of the sushi restaurant. The price was good plus the drink is included, if you get the AYCE sushi.The food was great and delicious! Especially the baked mussels!!  Definitely bringing more friends here. Thanks you Simon for the great food! :)</Review>

< Review>
It was really good in every way. Food, drink, price, and service.  They were safe as far as Covid-19 which we appreciated.   The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is because I'm not a huge fan of mayo (or "spicy mayo") that they put on a lot of their rolls.  I know I could order without but I usually share rolls so I hate to veer from the menu based on my personal tastes.   But everyone I have shared their rolls with agrees.  So next tim I will definitely ask for no mayo.<//Review>

Tasty rolls and very fast take-out service. I ordered through Google/Postmates, and the order was ready even faster than the original estimate.

I loved the Hot Night roll!<//Review>

First time here and I think this place is pretty good over all. There is plenty of parking in the shared shopping center lot. We were seated quickly and service was fast. They no longer offer all you can eat sushi, via a paper notice on their door(bummer) but for about the same you would spend on all you can eat you still get a good amount and filled up by ordering by the roll. The staff are up beat and friendly and prices are fair. I really enjoyed "the diamond bar" roll. I'd come here again. For sure.</Review>

Their korean style chinese foods are good. The jjambong was very spicy. It would be nice if less spicy. Also they started fried chicken recently, and it was really tasty.< /Review>

Food is often very good quality and menu is quite vast. Disappointed to learn that they no longer offer AYCE (all you can eat) sushi. Each sushi platter ranges between $5-$18 depending on whether you order sashimi, nigri, simple rolls, or specialty rolls. You can still order enough rolls to be full and satisfied for $40 or so. Staff is also very friendly. "Happy hour" specials seem to last all day and vary each day.</Text>

No more all-you-can-eat?!?! Great food, great service, great prices, great owner, poor decision-making on pricing model! Loved this place but probably won't be back.</Text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Great Salmon Nigiri and Ramen, a bit confusing being branded as a Korean Restaurant on all the windows and sign but the menu is almost exclusively Japanese dishes and even says it’s Japanese food.

Not the best I’ve had but way above the average cheap sushi shop.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Excellent for a small group. Authentic but modern, not intimidating like some places. Friendly and attentive staff, even on a weekday. Fair prices and extra deals. All you can eat for sure and a little more too. "Lion" roll will change your life.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>Great variety of sushi rolls , friendly staff , great ambiance. Ended up paying around $45 for myself to get full without the tip 😣. So probably wouldn't go back when I could pay the same at an AYCE place for two people.< /Text>< Pics>

we came in and ordered for to go. the food we received was quick to order and quick to serve as well. we spent a total of less than 10 minutes. if you want a quick sushi fix, i would suggest coming here. it's arguably inexpensive and an enjoyable atmosphere with a 'all you can eat' option available that is good priced< /Review>

He’s pretty nice and the sushi all you can eat was great! For service I have to give five star, we don’t really like the miso soup so we didn’t drink a lot, he asking me for the reason why ? And I told him, it might be too salt for us, for this detail. I know they’re care about me, respect the customer. Only thing is I forgot to take pictures, but I will definitely come back !

The rule they have that if u want all you can eat your hole party needs to get it. Not everyone like to eat big amounts of sushi. Other than that it was OK service could of been a bit more attentive it was not even busy for them to not help up fast enough<//Review>

Great food for reasonable prices. The staff was very friendly and respectful. The owner even told us about a contest that they were doing for New Years, which he entered us in by taking our pictures. I highly recommend getting the "all you can eat" deal since the value is great considering the individual prices of the sushi dishes.</Text>

<Review>Awesome awesome spot. Ive been going to get sushi before it qas Fushion and the service sucked!
Now the sushi is seriously on point- and filling! And the service is top notch! The manager /Owner? is so fun and nice and really takes care of you. He's always around!

Great prices, two options for AYCE Sushi and everything you'd want is included. Under $35, for that selection, for the amazing taste- best spot in town. Shhh, I hope it doesnt get busy.< /Review></record>

Was excited to try this place and ordered basic tuna rolls and tuna sushi and a couple teriyaki bowls and the tuna was slimy and the color was not right , wish I would had inspected the food better but it was already packed up for a to go ordered and I just glanced to make sure everything was there .    Also the teriyaki chicken was a little dry and for the price I was sadly disappointed .< /text>

Updating my review. The service is still friendly. But the fish quality is below average the past few times I've been there. It is still one of the few places in the area that is good for grabbing a casual beer with friends<//text>

Service was awesome Justine was wonderful and her recommendation of the orange blossom roll definitely hit the spot.

Also! They have a buy 1 beer and get a 2nd for a penny!! Gotta go back again soon!</text>< Response>

<Text>Located on the second floor of a shopping plaza , that has plenty of free parking . Not to sure if they have access for someone who is in a wheelchair . It would be best to call the restaurant to check .
We came in and decided to order the all you can eat menu . And boy it did not disappoint , they gave a good amount of fish with very minimal rice .
I am so glad too ,that they offer some rolls that are 4 pieces only . We came in and they had a few tables filled up, so service was a little on the slower side .
But food came out in a descent amount of time .
The owner Simon came towards the end of our meal and was really nice . And even gave a bottle of wine for our group to take home , since someone was celebrating a special day.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c32c9216ab72eb:0xe40b43ecb9c8cbfa</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

- Calamari Rings (Rubbery, hard to chew through)
- Fish is pre-sliced, not sliced to order

My coworkers and I went here for lunch today, we're fortunate enough to be walking distance to this place. The restaurant has a lot of seating both at the bar and at the tables. For lunch, this place is not very crowded which works in our favor seeing how we have a one hour lunch. It's $21.95 for lunch, which is a bit more expensive than other AYCE lunch places, BUT the quality makes up for it here at Fusion 2. We ate at the bar and primarily ordered nigiri, don't know how their rolls or appetizers are (besides the calamari rings).

This place is able to compete along side the other AYCE Sushi restaurants and in some cases beat them out with their specialty 'Fushion Sushi' offerings.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK42U6P1QkJpCazMC2LoS_rExurLp-hjNPt5Et=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

My fiance and I came here last night...last minute.... and we enjoyed every minute of our time here.  I was a bit confused about the seating arrangement/rule they have but it worked out just fine in the end. Also, I'm not a big seafood eater but my fiance helped with what was too fishy and what wasn't and I must say every roll I ate was very fresh and delish. Sooo much food for such a great deal even after a bottle of hot saki and 4 large bottles of Asahi. We even had a short lesson from Simon (owner) on how to use chopsticks.  He was such a FUN guy the whole night and our server was the cutest as she tried to be sooo helpful with the menu with very minimal english she spoke. We just moved to DB and I must say that we will for sure be back here again. Simon, thank you for the great experiance, "I say saki you say bomb" and see you soon. All our best, Jesse 💖 Angie Miranda...  😁🍣🥢🥢🍲🍶🍺<//text>

I happened to stumble upon this place by chance - I was supposed to meet a friend from out of town  who was delayed. I was super hungry and saw that Fusion 2 Any 1 was in the same shopping plaza as the It's A Grind coffee house that was our rendezvous point.

This is one of those moments when you feel as if you've found a gem. As a city boy, I'm used to higher prices and smaller portions (and lower quality, in some cases). And AYCE sushi always leaves me wary, especially buffet style. However, my expectations were upended in the most awesome way. The lunchtime price of $24 bucks gets you satisfying made-to-order AYCE sushi. With a drink included. And ice cream. !!!

My order consisted of a spicy 4-piece Tokyo Roll, an 8-piece Unagi roll, an 8-piece spicy tuna roll, 2 pieces of tuna sushi, and 2 pieces of Unagi sushi. The Tokyo had a nice kick to it though the fish on top was a little dry. The spicy tuna roll was PACKED with fish; the most I'd ever seen. The Unagi roll and sushi were tasty and generously sized. Lesser places have eel that tastes off - like dirty water - and drown the eel in sauce. Here, the eel was tender, mild, and just darn good. The tuna sushi was decent, too. A la carte, these items would total about $40.

The service was just fall-over-oneself wonderful. Seriously. It was almost too much! The sushi chefs and servers greet everyone as they come in. And two people ended up taking care of me while I was there sitting at the bar. They were so attentive, polite, and professional. Really, everyone was so nice.

This review is from an uncrowded weekend lunch experience. But between the solid sushi, extremely polite and welcoming staff, and fantastic AYCE quality-for-the-price that includes a soda and ice cream, a 5-star rating is a no-brainer. I'm rarely ever (never?) In San Dimas, but if you find yourself here or are in neighboring areas looking for a good AYCE sushi place, this place is definitely worth trying.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It really gives a little.
Two people eat it, but only one chopstick is put in.
I am really unkind and will never go again.
H mart gimbap was rather thin.

(Original)
정말 조금 줍니다.
두명이 먹는데 젓가락 한개밖에 않넣어요.
정말 불친절하고 다신 않갑니다.
차라리 H mart 김밥이 월씬 났습니다.</review>

(Translated by Google) Jjambbong can't be this delicious.
I've tried many champon, but I really want to praise it.
This restaurant will be blessed to try to taste this.

(Original)
짬뽕이 이렇게 맛있을 수가 없네요.
수많은 짬뽕을 먹어 봤지만 정말 칭찬해 주고 싶네요.
이런 맛을 내기 위해 노력하는 이 레스토랑은 복을 받을 겁니다.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Mom & Pop type shop with good prices. Everyone is friendly and helpful. It's nice to go in there, they always greet you. And they have absolutely anything and everything snack related, plus a very large selection of wines and liquor. Beer is cold! Also, the parking lot is always clean, no shady dudes loitering, and it's easy to get in and out no matter which direction you come from or go to - it's super easy to just pop in for a second. It's a great neighborhood shop - lucky neighborhood!<//review>< Pics>

The staff at this AutoZone are incredible!  Needed a new battery after a day of skiing, and they a) answered the phone (accomplishment!), b) immediately checked if they had the battery so I could know if I should come in, c) loaned me EXACTLY the right tools to swap out the battery, d) checked the warranty on the previous battery to help me make sure I needed to make the change, and e) were super friendly and helpful the entire time.<//Text>

My battery died on our family trip to Tahoe; yikes! After getting a jump I drove to AutoZone Auto Parts to have my battery tested and likely replaced. As I had previously purchased my battery for an AutoZone Auto Parts store back home, I was hoping they could look up my history to see how long the battery had lasted.

To my surprise, my battery was still under warranty and the staff was super helpful with everything. The process was smooth and easy and my battery was changed out quickly. Family vacation was back on track thanks to AutoZone Auto parts in South Lake Tahoe.< /Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>I like this store! Today I bought fuel additive, with a dozen more to choose from. I've gotten good service from the staff, they are usually knowledgeable and helpful. I stopped there a few months ago because the check motor light came on. The gentleman plugged in his diagnostic tool and told me there was a problem with the catalytic converter or the sensors (2) that mesure the amount of oxygen going through the system. He then offered to look up the cost of the sensors as well as a new converter. I knew it wasn't the catalytic converter for it wouldn't run correctly. He then suggested I could use a fuel system additive that would turn off the check motor light, and if it turned off, its the sensors. I followed his recommendation and sure enough the light didn't come on again. All in all a good place to go for your car needs. They also lend tools to fix your car right there in the lot. Easy access right on Hwy 50, on the lake side of the road.<//Text>< pics>

Wanted to give a big shout out to South Lake Tahoe Auto Zone.  Specifically Daniel !! We were camping in our RV and on our departure needed a part for our RV battery.  We called Auto Zone and Daniel confirmed they had the part and offered to bring the part to us. (We did not tow our car this time) he even assisted my husband with attaching it to his battery and refused to take a tip.  This type of service is over and beyond. Thanks again Daniel and Auto Zone.< /Review>

Came in today with a battery that kept dying. I had purchased it at the store 2 years ago, winters are tough on batteries up here in the Sierra. The super helpful staff were on it. Looked up my warranty, tested the battery and said NP on a replacement. Even carried it out to the car.  Could not have been nicer. Well Done. Missed the name of who helped me but she was the only gal working today.<//Review>

<review>My battery died unexpectedly while on vacation. My husband and granddaughter went into AutoZone to see what could be done. Christian assisted them and went above and beyond in doing so. My husband told her he was trying to educate my granddaughter as to how to work through these things and Christian took the time to walk her through testing the battery, selecting the correct replacement etc.  We had not packed any tools and she even allowed them to borrow what was needed. Because of Christian and her service, we will start doing business with the AutoZone store in our hometown.  They will have a tough act to follow. :-)  Thank you for all you did, Christian!< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1597393632108, 'text': "Thank you for the great review, Rose!

<text>Fernando (the manager) went Above & Beyond in resolving my return.
He was working with another group of customers at the same time as helping Me......and teaching another employee how to order another part for me.
Attitude was above 7,000 feet👍
I WILL be back.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

WARNING:  If you call ahead to reserve tire chains, they may not keep the reservation.  We called at 8am today to reserve a set and were told a set was put on hold for us for 12 hours.  When we got there around 1pm, they told us they were out of the chains we had reserved, having sold the last ones after we put them on hold.  They weren't very apologetic and did not offer any solutions as we left the store without chains in a snowstorm.< /Review>

Super friendly service. Came in buy a new car battery and was offered to test the current battery and alternatot for free.  Since battery was ready to swap out, I got it replaced in 2 mins.  Definitely the place you go for your car needs.< /text>

Make sure you know what your looking for because the staff isn't knowledgeable at all, I came in looking for transmission fluid told them what make/model, the older, tall white haired guy is a goof, he couldn't help @ all he tried to send me away, I actually told him what I wanted after, he couldn't help correctly, its great this store exist but educate your staff so the whole customer service can be memorable in a positive way!</Text>

< Review>
Good selection of parts and accessories at reasonable prices.  Good central S. Tahoe location.

I popped in to get winter wipers, since the OEM ones on my new-ish 4wd SUV were intricate metal 'summer' models, and quickly turned into worthless clubs of ice while driving through February snow with a somewhat warm windshield.

Autozone had a good selection in various price ranges in stock. Made the drive home much more pleasant! And safer.</Review>

< review>
Good selection of parts and accessories at reasonable prices.  Good central S. Tahoe location.

I popped in to get winter wipers, since the OEM ones on my new-ish 4wd SUV were intricate metal 'summer' models, and quickly turned into worthless clubs of ice while driving through February snow with a somewhat warm windshield.

Autozone had a good selection in various price ranges in stock. Made the drive home much more pleasant! And safer.< /review>

I was driving to Autozone with a headlight out after dark and literally got pulled over on the way there. Normally I install new lights myself but it takes me a little while, so when the clerk asked if I wanted him to install it I was super grateful as I had already been stopped by the cops once!  Last winter I bought new windshield wipers and they were really not cutting it, icing over when it was snowing hard; luckily I still had my receipt and the staff at Autozone were happy to give me their full value towards a new set of wipers when I went in, and again they installed them for me.  Great staff here.< /Text>

< Review>
WORST customer service EVER! I just left the AutoZone in South Lake Tahoe and it was by far the worst experience I've ever had at an establishment! The old man with the 3 ft long Duck Dynasty beard needs to take a bath and God forbid wash those clothes. But first and foremost why don't you start off saying...HI perhaps! No no no stand in the corner having me wait in line while you stare right at me! And to the lady that rang me up thanks it only took the store 10 mins to get a bottle of air filter cleaner good job!! Bahaha don't waste your time at this location or any near...trust me when i say you be disappointed lmao!< /Review>

Really good selection of automotive accesories, polite and courteous staff as well as knowledgable about most things automotive. Plus, thier hours are suited to people that work full time and have no way of getting what they need before 5 oclock, 5 days a week. I use them exclusively for all my repair needs.< /text>

What a familiar flavor! Incredible service. And hand made food. Doña Sandra.... Put the Salvadorian touch to each item on the plates.</text>

<Review>Okay Salvadoran food, pupusas didn't have much flavor imo. They're a bit over priced too, better places around and much cheaper. Their empanadas are okay, lacking in flavor as well, even with the sweet custard. Parking for establishment is the rear or street parking in front.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5MvgrYQD8rN8_pQhSPhMgadV2W4IDa2uDv-SZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmf2OEvhJ8cnDJTSw6RGDk9aStWZOfk6Xsjax1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuIrILy6qgp9UI6IgHsMI07waQgr1pPUsZQpxx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR7yJtJKZwIzMuBdy9xz4Db8JrXYEB1Po2A1tC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3gcJwQH2u4jQipnGAaa8_LwLDdZKq9dPgrt7k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRYae2FehtK3LkA1D4h6XvQTsqdx3uF0UC7J0g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIVd4k5gpIODnyJiCtlJaCpxHbJGg0PPqg0TpU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNx4o8TaNmFQEyJUO7CIc2rb0quuJW_pRf43cf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzXAI07uEOqxDWjpgAsRjeZS2LRIKdT3i3oh6f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great food !Great prices! Sandra the waitress was excellent. Sandra the chef really takes pride in her food, the taste is amazing ..... Looks like ownership really values client experience. They even have parking in the rear. A place I will definitely be visiting more often.<//Text>

<Text>Definitely recommend! This is going to be my go to place for pupusas now. I had a place in my home town that I would go to for the past 15 years and was hesitant to try any others but this place is amazing.

I usually call in my order when heading over (15 min drive) that way we don’t have to wait too long when we arrive to the restaurant!</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The food here is really good it's very clean and so far everything I've had is pretty fresh. I've never had a lot of Salvadorian food so I can't speak on whether it is truly authentic but for what it is it's very good very clean and it's not heavy at all. at least for me that's a really good sign is when the food is not greasy at all. And the prices are very very good considering it's Burbank. It's a little bit hard to find but it's definitely worth it and it's cozy and nice and the staff is very friendly.</Review>

<Review>The first time I went, i thought its a new restaurant which I explored. But it was there for a while . I loved having my fajitas. it was really good. The food from the 2 old people cooked just for you as you like it. I felt this place more close calm and a good place to have a calm dinner.< /Review>< response>

< Review>
Food was too pricey. For just 2 people came out to be 50$.  The pupusas didn’t even taste the greatest. Doesn’t t even taste like El Salvadorian food. The food tasted white washed, yuck. Food took the longest to come out. Was a waste of time and money. The lady who took our order was rude, didn’t even give us a receipt for what we ordered.

Was looking for some good Salvadorin food since our main restaurant was closed for Tuesday. Would love to give only half a star but it didn’t let me. Next time we will just wait the next day to enjoy good and satisfying food. Will not be returning ever again.<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>One time I found myself in Burbank. I had not had pupusas in years and that made me sad. I found this place through Google and I had pupusas.  I was happy again. A void in my heart was filled. I would come here again. Parking is on the street. It's a small place. If you are in Burbank and want pupusas, you should go here. They are also good as leftovers.  So, don't be afraid to order an extra one or two to go.<//review><rating>5<//rating><name>shannon barrett< /name>< Response>

<text>So good I forgot to take a picture. I lived in Honduras hace casi 30 anos pero me enamoro con pupusas. Que suerte que Los Angeles tiene gente de tantas culturas especialmente gente de El Salvador.
Revueltas, chorizo, and jalapeno pupusas were delicious and full of flavor. Yuca, rice, and black pinto beans were also yummers. I added some of the slaw, salsa, and crema to my beans and rice though to give it extra flavor. The Calabasitas pupusa was not as flavorful as the rest but I will definitely be going back ❤️👍👍 for sure</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bfe309764763:0xb0f540a17583015a</Gmap_id>< resp>

Food is very good I am a regular customer  one thing I do not like at all is that when you arrive at the restaurant is a sign : "" Cash Only "" I don't understand why??  and another thing that you can not leave the TIP waitress when you pay with a card when they accept it,
that's why I do not go so often, hopefully change that.<//Text>

Terrible service, I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! The male waiter is rude and has an attitude towards customers! The food was average and it took me more than an hour just to receive my food and it wasn't even good tasting. When I explained to the male waiter that my order was wrong, he decided to have an attitude with me and roll his eyes. I never been disrespected like this in a restaurant! Save yourself from the terrible service, disrespect, and food . Sorry not sorry</text>

<review>Great and close to work. Simple and excellent food. Stick to just 2 pupusas. Trust me. Ha.

Update: took 45 to tell me my two pupusas are about to come out. I was dinning in. I was told by the server to order ahead of time next time to avoid the wait. Order ahead of time to dine in? Wow. Lowered to two stars.</review><time>1491596732264<//time>< Name>

Burbank is not known for having latin food because theres not much to choose from. But with luck, I stumbled upon  this pupuseria. Tucked in on victory, right between a yatch shop and mechanic shop is a place where you can go and satisfy your salvadorian cravings but in exchange, you have to struggle with parking. The food is done from scratch and as you know, great food takes time. So if you're  in a time crunch, I would suggest to call the order in(they have delivery as well). They have a large selection of authentic salvadorian dishes. From pupusas, cheese oozing out on one side and crunchy golden brown burnt cheese on the other. Served with fresh and crisp cultido (pickled cabbage) which you can never have enough. Crispy Yucca frita, steaming hot served with  soft and chewy carnitas.  Atol de elote (sweet corn atole) served with a sweet corn on the cob on the side so you can personally scrape the corn into your rich and creamy drink. Fried  Platanos fritos that always seem to be ripe perfectly. They have a small selection of beer both American and imported.  Fresh agua frescas and horchata. Basically,You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The server is friendly and is flexible to most special request. It is definitely worth visiting if you're around burbank and in the mood for a salvadorian experience.<//Text>

The papusas were pretty good here, but that's literally it. It is normal prices for Salvadoran food, but honestly, the portion sizes were too small. I am not sure if it's because we came in an hour before closing, but the food wasn't very good. The papusas were tasty, but I would only recommend getting that. They also gave us cabbage that wasn't seasoned. It comes with papusas. The people at the table next to us had the right type of cabbage, but for some reason, they just gave is a clump of unseasoned cabbage. We probably won't be back, but the papusas were good.<//text>

Horrible horrible service by Robert, the waiter/manager of the joint. Went there on my lunch hour with my mother and it was advertised on Friday that papusas are $1.25 each. Even when I looked on the menu it said bean and cheese and bean cheese and meat papusas are $1.25 on Tuesday's and Friday's. So I thought how perfect because I was going to get those two flavored papusas. When it came time to pay, my receipt said he charged me double for each papusas. So my mom mentioned the sign it said $1.25 and with sass he responded that was for the mini papusas. Then my mom mentioned it didn't specify what type and has she known she would have ordered the smaller ones and he snapped and said "well, you should have asked"..... he has been rude to us before and I've let it roll off my back, but this was enough for me not to go back. The food is not all that great either, it was just convenient to visit when I took my car to the mechanics across the street. But i'm not going to pay my hard earned money to be mistreated there again.</review>

Went there for lunch because of the big sign outside that announced that pupusas were 1.25 each.  Went in and sat down the waitress was pleasant but the food took nearly my entire lunch hour. Then when time came to pay the bill, it was 2.75 each pupusas. I told the guy about the sign stating that pupusas were 1.25. He very rudely replied that's for the mini pupusas. Then I told him that nowhere was it specified that it was for mini pupusas  and I was not told about that when I ordered my food.  The guy at the register was very short and said I should have asked. And rolled his eyes. I will never go back there the only reason I have it one star was because the waitress was not rude, because even the food sucked.< /Text>

<Text>Called in an order and was
Told that order will be ready in 20-30mins. When arrived after 30 minutes the cashier/restaurant manager (Robert or Albert) as he referred to as his title, said to me that my order was not ready and that it will take another 30 minutes.  I kindly paid  for my order and went outside to wait for my order inside my car.  Came back in after 15 more minutes at this time will be 45 minutes after my initial call-in I asked him if my order was ready. With a rudely voice and rolling his eyes at me he answered "NO! Your order is not ready yet" i asked him kindly if he knew how much longer it will take. He then again rudely and with a bad attitude answered " I don't know and if
You Want to know why don't you ask our cooks in the kitchen". Obviously this was all said in Spanish.  OMG.  I've never ever been treated so badly at any restaurant.  Anyway this was just the beginning but didn't end up nicely he practically said he was in charge and that's the way he run the restaurant if I liked well if not "bye".  This all while other patrons at the restaurant. No apologies for making me wait 1hr.  I could go on and on about my bad experience but I'm not going to. I'll keep short and simple. I come here to see that coincidently there's a 5 star review from
2 weeks ago with a picture attached to the review which clearly shows the picture taken behind the countertop. Hmmmmm. And it's from "Robert". Really!! Could it be so much coincidence that this Same restaurant manager left a 5 star review.  Oh well. I'm a regular customer and this is by far the worse I've been treated.  Definitely not going back after this.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) I love this restaurant is clean, and friendly, staff I know take long to make the food but its ok. Becouse evering is fresh and noting is frozzen
People from the Television Network also love is great place.
It really fascinates me this restaurant is clean that the employees are friendly it is worth waiting a bit to get the food because everything is fresh and prepared instantly nothing is frozen.
People of the artistic environment are fascinated to come to this place also for something to be.

(Translated by Google) The owner does not know how to treat clients with respect, they only sell takeaways, when if they allow people of their preference to eat indoors, they do not come to eat more, the businesses are due to the clients but if they do not know how to treat them, they Do something else and close your doors, and only then will you learn not to be arrogant.

(Original)
La dueña no sabe tratar a los clientes con respeto, solo venden comida para llevar, cuando si permiten comer adentro a gente de su preferencia, no vengan a comer más, los negocios se deben a los clientes pero si no saben cómo tratarlos, que se dediquen a otra cosa y cierren sus puertas.Solo así aprenderan a no ser arrogantes.</text>

(Translated by Google) That place is a robbery they do to people.
Cheap buffet that has better food street food and sell it as a first service
Do not waste your time and money spending a bad taste here in this restaurant

Wow this store has a lot of flooring variation but very poor customer service in the way that you walk in and no body greets you they speak poor English they don't have all items in stock and that is so sad because I have found the floor I wanted. Luckily I drove down the street and found Expo Flooring located 1933 S Alameda St. Los Angeles, CA. 90058 they are great have a wonderful variation awesome customer service and had everything I needed in stock!<//Text>

This little spot is where I decided once and for all that sobriety was the life for me. That my life had spun completely out of control and I was powerless over marijuana, other people, booze, all my addictions and I seriously needed God's help and a 12 step program to save me.  They also offer great outreach to the wonderful and amazing Seniors in the community including dance classes, sitting exercise classes, daily meal distribution,  book lending program, and many other social networking events for the most  treasured in our society :)< /text>

We both ordered salads. I placed my order first. It took 30 minutes for my coworker to get her salad order, which was placed several minutes after mine (I ordered a Southwest Chicken Salad). There were at least 5 people working in the kitchen. I really can't say what they were working on, but it most certainly was not my simple salad! After being asked 3 times, what I ordered, I simply decided to get my refund! No apology for poor service, no anything! All I heard as I was leaving,  was "cancel the salad!" Since when does it take more than 30 minutes to make a salad?! I will not return! Zero stars if it was possible!< /text>< pictures>

Delicious Charbroiled Tuna Sandwich (all bun/sandwich items can be requested as a lettuce wraps) & Tampura Green Beans! Fries, Onion Rings, and Sweet Potato Fries are also an option!!
Great customer service. Online ordering makes this establishment innovative and diligent for a quick bite to eat.

Enjoy beverage refills of Strawberry Lemonade, Peach and Ginger Nectar, and the classic carbonated sodas.< /Review>

<review>30min minimum wait for 1 burger and fries with onion rings. Fries were cold. Burger was made wrong. Buns were burnt. Not toasted, burnt. Customer service seemed decent but back kitchen was a mess!! Very disappointed overall. 2nd time I have been here. 1st time was when they opened. Can clearly see nothing has changed for the better.......well, their onion rings were good but that's it.< /review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

Update: Still no answer from messaging them, good luck to anybody trying to contact.  Changing to one star from two.

The first time I ate here was good.  Everything was correct and the food was good.  This time around my order was wrong and I didn't realize it until later.  I have a bad habit of trusting places to not make mistakes but this wasn't even a minor mistake.  I ordered a portobello mushroom charburger with sourdough substitute and added bacon.  What I got instead was some kind of chicken sandwich, with no premium ingredients.  It very clearly costs less than what I paid for.  I can't be bothered to go back and I'm just not ever going to return.  To anybody that tries this place, make absolutely sure you got what you ordered before you leave.</review>

<text>Burger was edible, to much sauce and therefore very drippy. Fries were completely not edible. Cold and very very soggy. Watched our fries and onion rings sit on top of counter for over ten minutes while waiting on burgers.</text>< pics>

<review>My first visit to The Habit and it was underwhelming.  We ordered a garden salad and it tasted like an airline salad with wishbone dressing.  I was hugely disappointed when I ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar cheese and was told they only have 2 types of cheese...yellow American and white American.  This is a burger restaurant with no cheddar.  I got an overpriced fast food burger with cold sweet potato fries.  The dinning area is so small and the outside seating didn't have heaters.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMblx8-ntqfff0-VLvPTiItDqOvUIOb118qCBsw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2ijcmmp15PdMzskfUxp_VpY_NLv-bzi8AFyZL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm95Ps_VQAOetiTp1VAaoz6Umhg9H81v9443DW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkSFmC4Eo7rv_hwo8jxCZB45XDtHLS42_R84EI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Usually love the food. Today (3/21/2021) we noticed they had added self ordering kiosks. We customized each of our meals, but when we got home we realize our food was not made the way we ordered it. Unfortunately we also didn't get the add-ons that we were charged for.
What's the point of a self kiosk and customizing your order if they're not gonna read the order?!< /Text>

Good selection, just enough for variety, just few enough to be really good at all off them.  Easy pickup, very organized. Shakes and malts are really good. Not too pricy for the product. Recommended!</Text>

<user>115673604601436616507<//user><Review>I ordered through the app for curbside pickup for two chocolate malts we waited patiently in the car after i checked in. Not a single person came outside to the curbside. After 40 minutes I had to go inside and the employee couldnt find my order. Another employee asked for my order and then proceeded to hand me two melted malts with only an "im sorry" The didnt offer to remake fresh ones. They claim my car wasnt on there but I had inputed it nd even if there wasnt a description they should have someone come out and check. UNBELIEVABLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE HORRIBLE.<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>Very disappointed. Ordered, and paid an extra $1.50 for, bacon to be added and there was no bacon.  Because I had to be home to relieve an outside caretaker, I didn't have time to go back in. Also, my burger was barely warm.< /Review>< Resp>

Usually we love the Habit. Best fast food around. Today it was a long wait, cold food, and looks like they are now serving smaller burgers. Maybe that's just my perception though. Either way, not the quality we have become used to.<//Text>

< Review>
The first time I ordered from there was good, but after some time they began to disappoint me. Im not complaining about the flavor and whatnot. Instead its about customer service. 4 times did they get my order wrong and its a very simple order and easy to prepare. Usually I order a plain char burger with strawberry lemonade and fries. After getting the order wrong several times they ended up giving me 3 coupons for one free burger each. I decided to use one, but they got it wrong again. Instead I got a Hawaiian burger. What made it worse this time was that for some reason it was very soggy, as well as the French fries and other side dishes in the bag. I asked my mom and she confirmed that it was oil. Luckily not a lot of it was on the burger. I understand if they mess it up the first or second time, but 4 times is when I have to intervene.< /Review>

My favorite sandwich there is charbroiled tuna sandwich all bun/ sandwich items can be requested as a lettuce wraps for healthier option. Great customer service. Online ordering makes this location innovative and diligent for a quick bite to eat.<//Review>

The first time we frequented this place, the meat to bun ratio was quite disproportionate. This time it looks a lot better. Everything about this place is great: The food, drinks staff, etc. During the day time, it's quite crowded so we like to frequent during the night time when it's less busy. Great location in between two dessert places: Coldstone or Frozen yogurt.</text>

Counter staff is nice, kitchen staff struggles to make food. We have been here 2 times, and both times my husbands burger was messed up.  Same exact order, they keep putting onions on it when he asks for none. Also what is the point of outside coronavirus dining, if no one is cleaning tables in between patrons.< /Review>

Visited earlier today to pick up an order inside all i have to say is that I appreciate every one of those hard workers during this pandemic especially when not many places are open. Unfortunately when I walked in it was hotter than outside, this is not good for the employees and im a manager who works in food, i know there are state/union regulated standards to employee health in their working environment. I'm surprised that none of them have dropped from heat stroke/exhaustion. I work with an oven I know how miserable it can get without proper ventilation and A/C. FIX IT NOW! Or you are going to have a problem....</Text>

<Review>Actually, the string beans were crispy at this location versus my local Habit. I have to say Limonite Avenue makes them better.  Otherwise, you know what you're getting... Good burgers.

A friend recommended it to me because he knows I love cheese burgers. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the temperature in the restaurant, warm. If the A/C was on it was set pretty high. Very stuffy stagnate air in the dinning area. Was greated by a friendly women who I assumed was a manager or shift leader because she was wearing a different colored shirt than everyone else. I ordered the sesonal item, Santa Barbara Char burger. Comes with 2 burger patties both topped with cheddar cheese and grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and avocado. I also got an order of fries, well done,  because lets be honest, fries are never as crispy as they should be because restaurants are in such a hurry to get food out. Also ordered the tempura green beans. My friend got the single char with swiss, grilled onions and lettuce. He's kind of a plain guy, I always say you can tell a lot about a person by how they order a cheese burger. Anywho my Santa Barbara burger was good the patties were seasoned properly the cheese was perfectly gooey, melty, the grilled onions were ok. Not as carmelized as they could be in my opinion. The Santa Barbara char comes on grilled bread not your traditional hamburger bun. All in all a pretty good burger. It just still has that synthetic fast food feel about it. No home made love feel like I get at In n Out or Riders Club. The fries were cooked well as I ordered them but you could tell they were frozen. Definitely not In n Out fresh cut quality. The tempura green beans were good. But for $2.99 I feel like we should have got more than what they gave us, kinda stingy if you know what I mean. Drink selection was good. I'm an iced tea guy so it was pretty cool they had three fresh brewed teas to choose from, black tea, tropical tea and a citrus green tea. Also had strawberry limeade which was pretty good. In the end I would eat here again if I was in the area and didn't want to wait the 15 minutes it would take to get to In n Out.</review><rate>3< /rate>< UserId.>

< Review>
The servers/ cooks where very unprofessional and disrespectful. This has been one of my favorites spots to eat, I have eaten at a lot of different locations and the service has been great. Is disappointing to have experience this disrespect event at this Eastvale ca location. I’m a paying customer who always gives the respect due to people who work at this place   No reason why they not do the same .  Never again. Is the young guy with the funny tattoos in his arm. Poor place to take family out to eat.<//Review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I came here to get my son his birthday charburger.
While I was there I placed an order for my other sons and a burger for myself.
I placed the order to go because I didn't want to spend too much time in a crowded place with everything that has been going on.
I don't exactly live near this location, it's a good 10 miles or so from home.
I got notification that my order was ready.
The person working stated that the burgers were in one bag, underneath the fries and the other bag contained the kid's meal for my little one.
I looked inside and saw the burgers under there so I assumed they were all there.
When I got home and opened the bag, I immediately noticed that there was a burger missing, my burger.
The one that I paid extra for.
Their promotional Jalopeno Tempura Charburger.
I am usually a calm person, but I can not stand people who do not do their job properly.
This person stated to me that the burgers were under the fries.
Obviously, he was wrong.
I felt ripped off.
I paid for something that I did not receive.
I tried to call the store but calling the number does not result in contacting anyone physically at the location, but rather a call center.
Completely POINTLESS!
I am not going to drive 20-25 minutes go get something I was supposed to have in the first place.
When someone places an order, especially when it's to go, there should be extra care taken to make sure everything is in order.
There is nothing that can be done now to fix what has happened.
You guys dropped the ball here.
This is totally unacceptable and I do not see myself returning to this location again.</text>< time>

The place has good food except the fries were cold and saggy. I gave them 2 stars based on the lack of cleanliness and their saggy fries. The tables were filthy. The floor was extremely sticky and every table had trash around it. The drink area had so much trash I was not able to put the drink down to put a lid on it.

The poor girl giving out the food was also responsible for cleaning the area. She kept apologizing to people when they would ask her if someone could go clean the table.

Management really needs to have a specific  person to be responsible for keeping the place clean.< /Text>

<Text>Seriously, whoever was cooking there on the night of 1/2/2019... never let them go. Give them whatever they want in life. Also the people providing customer service... freaking epic!!! The burger and the steak sandwiches were magical. And I ate it the day after. I wanted to tip but I didn't bring cash.

Always a great meal! My son and I went here for lunch. He had the chicken nuggets and I had the Santa Barbara Char. This location has the best outdoor seating too. My only complaint is that the apples in my son's meal were bruised.</review>

<username>Deborah Fine< /username><Review>Received a gift card and was excited to try for first time.  The service was fine but the burgers were so salty that is all you could taste. Very greasy too. Fries were OK.  I will say the malts were great.  I was surprised how many people were eating food from other resteraunts there.
Customer care reached out to me after my review and I agreed to try again.  I ordered the burger with NO seasoning and it was great.  My husband got a bbq tri tip sandwich and said it was good.  Of course malts.  Glad we went back will eat there again. Changing my review.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I came here and ordered the Santa Barbara Char, expecting to receive something even moderately edible and was sorely disappointed. This "burger" is the soggiest, and most bland piece of trash I have ever spent money on just to throw away. The meat has no seasoning, the guacamole has no spice, and all the flavor came from the disgusting mayonnaise I forgot to ask to have removed.

To make matters worse, the inside of the restaurant smelled absolutely delicious. Now I say it smells absolutely delicious inside but the air was thick with the smell of Asian cuisine, not that of a burger joint. My senses were absolutely confused, and the entire scenario was off putting.<//Review>< Pics>

First time to eat at The Habit today. A friend recommended it to me because he knows I love cheese burgers. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the temperature in the restaurant, warm. If the A/C was on it was set pretty high. Very stuffy stagnate air in the dinning area. Was greated by a friendly women who I assumed was a manager or shift leader because she was wearing a different colored shirt than everyone else. I ordered the sesonal item, Santa Barbara Char burger. Comes with 2 burger patties both topped with cheddar cheese and grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and avocado. I also got an order of fries, well done,  because lets be honest, fries are never as crispy as they should be because restaurants are in such a hurry to get food out. Also ordered the tempura green beans. My friend got the single char with swiss, grilled onions and lettuce. He's kind of a plain guy, I always say you can tell a lot about a person by how they order a cheese burger. Anywho my Santa Barbara burger was good the patties were seasoned properly the cheese was perfectly gooey, melty, the grilled onions were ok. Not as carmelized as they could be in my opinion. The Santa Barbara char comes on grilled bread not your traditional hamburger bun. All in all a pretty good burger. It just still has that synthetic fast food feel about it. No home made love feel like I get at In n Out or Riders Club. The fries were cooked well as I ordered them but you could tell they were frozen. Definitely not In n Out fresh cut quality. The tempura green beans were good. But for $2.99 I feel like we should have got more than what they gave us, kinda stingy if you know what I mean. Drink selection was good. I'm an iced tea guy so it was pretty cool they had three fresh brewed teas to choose from, black tea, tropical tea and a citrus green tea. Also had strawberry limeade which was pretty good. In the end I would eat here again if I was in the area and didn't want to wait the 15 minutes it would take to get to In n Out.</Text>

Burgers are good; much better than any fast food joint. But I'm not in love with the place. Most mom & pop burger restaurants are better. Still, good all the same. Clean establishment and nice food court location<//review>

<Name>Rida Mahdi</Name><Review>Food was very good. Good service. Liked the beverage assortment. Place was very clean. Knowledgeable staff. Well, except a 'manager'  who I overhead talking to a young employee about Food Safety as he was counciling her about not cleaning up a small spill on the floor. But except for his misunderstanding the difference between Safety and Food Safety I will be back. Try it, you will enjoy it.<//Review>< Rate>

UPDATE 1/26/19
well I must say my experience was a bit better than before my food was excellent this time but (I know there's a but )the staff  seemed Soo dull  don't know  I'm use to going to the habit all the time (my favorite place to eat). The habit see is known for  being so welcoming this location just isn't. Butt This one staff member that was definitely on point with his customer service he stood out  his name was Dave aka purple shirt Dave👍🏽.

(Old review)
They was slow but they food was the same but eh idk different location just can't ever give same quality or service 🤷🏽‍♀️:c< /text>

Just the right size burger at just the right price. The menu is simple and the service friendly. They don’t have Dr. Pepper but they have lemonade. You may dine in or sit outside and take in the sites and people watch.<//Review>

Picked up lunch for someone, but it's always been good when I've gotten something. Burgers, salads, shakes, etc. The fried green beans are great too.<//review>

Meat patties were dry and tasteless. I ordered the mushrooms char, the golden chicken sandwich, and also 2 of Santa Barbara style as well. Thought trying more than one thing would be great but they were all terrible. My buns were chewy and very dry like they are old, pretty nasty. I threw most of my food away including the fries, very bland. I ordered tempura green beans and they were not crunchy but at least it was not bland. I asked for no pickles, spicy sauce for the chicken on the side, and avocado on the side because of food allergies. They ignored all request and that's why I'll never go back. They also give half patty on the Santa Barbara style instead of full meat patty... that was just a rip off. What I liked about this place... seating area outside.< /review>< pics>

Love the Habit! Often has a line up but that's because the food is awesome.  My favorite is the Chicken Sandwich on Sourdough adding pineapple and teriyaki sauce...messy but soooo good! Also love their tempura style green beans.
They've just added a number of salads, which is great if you're wanting something without bread.< /review>

Called in my order so that I could pick it up quick and head back home.  They told me my order would be ready at 7pm.  Well somehow my order got lost even though I had already paid for it over the phone.  Finally at 7:20 the person behind the counter offers to give me the food that's been sitting around for 30 minutes if I'd pay again.   Umm,  no thanks.  I will be calling the bank in the morning and I will not be back here.< /text>

< Review>
The Habit is a great place for food (try their tempura green beans, seriously -- life changing if you don't like green beans!) but more than this the Eastvale location's service is spectacular. I've never had a negative experience with the Habit, but the one at this location was above and beyond. Employees (not the manager, if I have their uniforms straight) walked around when they had no line and made sure everything was good for the customers, one even getting someone a refill. Really above and beyond imo!!</Review>

Burgers are delicious. The sweet potato fries are really good. Plus they have complimentary jalapeño, sport peppers and pepperocini for you to add to your Burger. Fast service. It gets busy during noon time And after 5pm until about 8pm.</Review>

Orders to go are rarely correct and some item are not even in bag!  Management is worthless when you call asking you to drive all the way back for them to change it.  Get a t right the first time!!!!</review>

Unlike most Habit Burger establishments, this one unfortunately falls short on service, seating occupancy, and a friendly staff. If you want patio eatery, this is it. Unfortunately for my family and I, today was 105° and sitting by the restrooms was our only option.</Text>

<review>The food is great but if you order a burger with bacon and cheese only and you keep getting it with barbecue sauce and onions there something wrong the people behind the counter don't know what buttons to push just to get a bacon and cheese burger and this is happened at multiple locations and the tri-tip sandwich was garbage at least at McDonald's they get your order right food is
