<text>My son loves rocks so we definitely had to stop in here during our trip to Joshua Tree. They had an excellent selection and the shop owner was super helpful and knowledgeable. Included with the purchase was a little info sheet for each rock. He loved it!</text>< pics>

This is the best rock shop I have ever been to!! A huge selection from all over the world and the people were great! I am so glad my sister and I found it when we visited Joshua Tree in October. I wanted to share pictures of the lamp made from Onyx that I brought home. It's like having a variety of different lamps, depending on which side you look at. I LOVE it!<//Review>

<Text>Customer service... subpar. I got the vibe these are just virtue signaling LA transplants and not born and raised locals, staking their claim here in this great town my family has lived in since old woman springs road was managed by a 4 way stop sign. Just so sad to see what LA has done to this beautiful area that was once peaceful, humble and kind. Now it’s the LA snobbery the locals despise. My friends and family who’ve been here before the “tourist boom” don’t welcome the attitude.<//Text><response>{'time': 1619364911238, 'text': 'Hi Brandi, life isn’t always the way we like and I do respect your felling! :) 🙏'}</response>< gmap_id>

I always love to collect crystals from places I go and I'm so glad I found Joshua Tree Rock Shop.
The staff member, Kelly, was very knowledgeable about all the crystals. I wasn't looking for anything in particular, and I kind of told her a bit about this trip. She recommended some stones that would help with some of the things I'm dealing with right now. I love that you get a colorful card about your piece, it makes me want to buy one of all of them lol
I will be ordering from them again for sure. Kelly told me I could call and she could help me figure out what I need over the phone too.< /Text>

They have a really big section of small pocket sized rocks to display sized rocks, every rock you get comes in a baggy with a card telling you of its healing properties as well.

The rock shop was/is amazing. So many beautiful and curious pieces everywhere. Our eyes darted in all directions to view interesting items. The owner/operator is the most excited-about-rocks person I ever met. The prices are great. My daughter found fire opals there. The owner got so excited and grabbed a spray bottle to show us the fire display from the black as it got wet. Definitely swing by the Joshua Tree Rock Shop. They have an Instagram presence too.</text>

<review>There are soo many beautiful crystals on display. Many of the crystals are inexpensive. There is a beautiful magical atmosphere once you walk through the door. The store clerk was so kind and very knowledgeable in the crystals. I had a great experience, one of the best crystals shops I have been to in a while! Amazing crystals everywhere! Also they have cards behind all crystals to describe it's healing and energy you could work with. I'm blessed to have stumbled upon this shop.<//review>< pics>

Great Prices! Tucked back into an obscure shopping center is an incredible little shop. A super fantastic add to the Joshua Tree community. Some fantastic pieces and even jewelry from local artisans! Do not miss this little place. The owner is fantastic as well and knows all about each item and how it relates to you! Crystal's, sage, rocks, and so much more</Review>

This store... I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this store was.  So many gems and such loving energy there. I had the pleasure to meet someone there who I saw on the screen and followed her work for years with rocks. I have followed her on her personal blog for years! She is our role model.  My children love her too and she got us into rocks. I didn’t know she worked there !  I was honored to meet Ms Sam kelly in person. She is the most kind, open, and seriously, the best when it comes to healing crystals.  She knows it all. I am so excited! I would 100% recommend this store.  There was another woman there who was just as kind.  So welcoming. Thank you so much for welcoming us with open arms and helping us with some healing rocks.  Ps, the smell In the store was absolutely amazing.

All I can say is WOW.
My fiancé came home the other day and all she talked about was Joshua Tree Rock Shop. She kept mentioning the helpful service of Sam Kelly and the wide variety that the shop provided. This got me excited, due to the fact she wants to become a Chrystal healer.

Today, after work, I decided to stop by the shop, in hopes that I could find healing stones, so my fiancé could start her supply. Upon immediate entry into the store, a young brown haired lady, welcomed me with open arms. I explained why I came in today, in hopes of helping my boo. And let me say— WOW.

Little did I know, this was the same lady, that my fiancé was talking about. Sam is the most helpful, kind, intelligent person that I could have ever wished to have helped me in this venture. She made everything incredibly easy to understand, since I’m not very knowledgeable of the subject. Because of Sam, my fiancé is absolutely thrilled of what I brought home for her!

10/10 will recommend this shop to everyone that I know. I wish I could give this shop, and Sam, more than 5 stars! Continue the great work, thank you again, so much!!</Text>

I loved the information I learned on the rocks and the rocks are breathtaking, so beautiful. How could a person leave that shop without purchasing something? I couldn't!!

<review>Disappointed. Necklace broke and tarnished within a few days. Wanted to love this place but I’m left feeling cheated for the money spent. Fortunately the stone fell out while I was home so maybe something can be done with it.

Update from original post! Superb customer service! I was able to speed with the owner and my necklace is being replaced! I’m very grateful:)<//review>< Pics>

You do not have to be a rockhound to appreciate the natural beauty and and energy and energy that Raw geodes, crystals, gems, and stones. Their collection is phenomenal and they know the source of every item offered. There is also beautiful handmade jewelry.

<review>Don't judge this place by the outside, it is amazing inside! Truly the best crystal shop I've been to. The owners are delightful and the wife makes all of the jewelry herself and it is so so beautiful and unique. They will be moving down the highway by Natural Sister's Cafe pretty soon. Definitely worth the stop in Joshua Tree.<//review>< Pics>

Drove out today from Palm Springs after checking out and being disappointed by other stone shops in the area.  Joshua Tree Rock Shop is WORTH THE DRIVE from anywhere in the near vicinity.  The vibe, the selection and the owners were awesome.  I have so many new beautiful stones and will definitely make the trek out again next time I visit SoCal!< /text>

Wonderful rock shop run by a sweet family from Brazil, who have been in the rock business since the 80s. The shop is so well laid out. It's organized, well lit and all the rocks are labeled. They even bag each stone you buy with a little card with a description and the name...so brilliant!< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) There are many stones that contain the energy of the land.
There are lots of unusual shapes and it's fun.

If you buy a stone, you will get a manual along with it, so it's recommended as a souvenir!

(Original)
土地のエネルギーが入った石がたくさんあります。
珍しい形などたくさんあって楽しいです。

石を購入すると説明書も一緒に入れてくれるので、お土産などにもオススメです！<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3ljMKeODW9_giYcFT1h3GsTp0Qb_bejDUq_zf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx4uSIpnN1Od4Mna6IzhFaBnmBCB5A2DGfk1lT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7NwhYoeq4hKjY8miHsYdwJN3uQSCEwp11Xne8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1571541434355, 'text': 'Thanks 🙏'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Johnny gave me a well detailed clean cut shave along with pointers on how to maintain my beard in order to maintain it. No barber shop is perfect but so far I've experienced the closest barber shop to perfection. They atmosphere here is really up to you and how you want to experience, if you don't feel like being talkative that's fine but they will greet you and make you feel at home. Thanks Johnny and the rest of Valley's finest barber shop for making my first time a pleasant experience, you gained a new happy customer. Good labor isn't cheap and cheap labor isn't good so don't come in expecting to get some coupon prices but I can assure you that you will come out with a well detailed cut that will make you feel good.</Text>< Pics>

Walked in and was greeted by all the staff, Got take care by Ryan and he took me right away. You can tell he really detailed and passionate about his work, I haven’t gotten a fresh cut like this in a while. And I’m extremely happy with the haircut. Thanks again Ryan and the Valley’s Finest Barber Lounge staff! I will definitely be back when I need a haircut. You gained a client in me Ryan!<//review>

<Text>It was my second time here, But the first time I came here the owner cut me up but this time Ryan gave me an even cleaner and way better haircut. No offense to the other barbers, Like I literally got the haircut I asked for and I couldn’t be anymore happier. He is very detailed and professional and can keep up a conversation and make you feel welcome and comfortable. I’ll definitely be stopping by soon.

<text>I gotta fresh cut here yesterday and called about getting a haircut and walked in and Ryan took me in his chair right away, Very professional, courteous and good vibes all around the shop and good conversations as well. I’m from Whittier and it was first time getting a cut in the valley so I was a bit skeptical. But Ryan exceeded my expectations and hooked it up with a very detailed and precise cut. I’m going to the army in 2 weeks but as soon as I get back I’ll be coming back to get a cut from Ryan. Thanks again guys!! 5 stars</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< date>

It was my first time here. What a great spot. Highly recommended.
Randomly found it because it was open late on sunday. Very good haircuts, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. Josh spent some time perfecting every detail. Will definitely come back again! Thank you!< /Review>

This place was recommended to me by a friend who has been getting cuts from Mike, who works here for over 20 years now. I have a 2 year old, who has been getting his hair cut since he could sit up. I hadn't felt comfortable with many other places. I tried Lollicut for about 6 months, but unfortunately they messed up my son's haircut once and it was so horrible that I never went back. I tried Mr. Scissors and I didn't have a great experience with the unwelcoming staff there. To be clear, my son doesn't cry at all nor does he move around constantly while his hair is cut. After purchasing my own clippers, trimmers, etc. and taking matters into my own hands for several months, I decided to give Mike a shot. I couldn't have been more pleased. The fading and lineup were exactly what I wanted for him. Mike made my son and I comfortable. We are extremely grateful to have been referred to him.</Review>

I usually don’t get my hair cut or  beard trimmed to often because I’m always busy at work but call and made an appointment with Ryan. Gave me a clean buzz cut and great beard line up/trim. This is a hidden gem in the valley. Def have to come back and see Ryan again. Thanks!< /text>

I am glad this crew opened up just a couple blocks from my house. called to see if they had capacity and was told I could walk in as there was no wait, although they prefer appointments. Levon was kind and courteous and hooked me up with a great cut in a very decent amount of time. Price was reasonable, and they accept cash or card. The vibe in here is great. They were playing some 90s music bringing my nostalgia on but it wasn't loud or obnoxious at all. Everyone was chill. They seem to be closed on Mondays and open 10 to 8 the rest of the week. I am not a huge fan of the parking lot but the plaza is connected to the Big Lots parking so that is very helpful. This spot will definitely earn some more business from me.</text>

Came here for the first time yesterday. Marco is so good I wanted to hire him on the spot for house calls Lol. I'm half black half Hispanic so my hairs a bit different and he was one of the only people able to get my hair right down to a T on his first try. Ask for MARCO he's legit.<//text>

Soo guys.... I called about making an appointment but they said that they only do walk ins on sundays and soo I came by and was greeted by Ryan and took me in his chair right away. It was my first time here and I really didn’t know what to expect but I was like super blow away dude by Ryan’s skills with the those clippers and scissors let me tell you. This is one the best haircuts I have ever had in a while. If anybody in the valley is looking for a good barber shop go to Valley’s finest and you won’t be disappointed. Ask for Ryan he will get you looking like a million bucks guaranteed. All the other barbers look like they are good as well but over all great experience. I’ll definitely be back here.</text>

I come here all the time as a regular, Always set up my appointments with Ryan. Its always easy to make an appointment and very convenient cos I live very close to the Valley’s finest barber lounge. Ryan always gets me right, I come into the shop looking bummy and walk out feelin fresh as hell. Shout to my boy, Always killin it! Ask for Ryan you won’t be disappointed, I’ll always be coming here to get my haircut word up.</review>

Responding to owners question, I am now giving 1 star becuase the fade I requested was much higher than asked for and was done in such a way as to have no choice but to move forward with it. Also to respond further to the owners response I was very explicit as to what I wanted. And to answer your question, any establishment with one money sign typically is around 17 dollars.
I have had haircuts for around 15 or 17 dollars that were better than this, and actually post there prices.
My mistake for starting a haircut that implied cheap but to find out it was not. And recieved a terrible hair cut.
Will not return.< /review>

Prices are outrageous. The haircut I asked for did not look anything like the image I brought in. I thought it would be worth the cost. But no one should pay that amount for such shady service.< /Text>

What do you mean we “only know how to shave” not sure what that even means.. we do whatever it is you REQUEST to be done.. our barber took you in as a last minute appointment on a Saturday.. So instead of “you’re welcome”, we’ll go ahead apologize for your having to wait.. if there’s anything about the actual finished product you are unhappy with we are more than happy to fix it for you!'}<//Response>

<review>RepairSmith was, by far, the single most amazing mobile repair service I have ever experienced. Their quote was spot on, their appointment window arrival; on time, the quality of service as good, or better than a dealer visit and their technician, Elias, incredibly courteous, thorough and highly efficient and resourceful. Elias was done in under and hour, and made the repair a proverbial snap! Hats off to him and RepairSmith for an overall A+ experience. Cheers!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I contacted RepairSmith to give my Ford Escape a quick once over to diagnose a few issues. The things he could fix on the spot he did, the work he was not able to do on sight I was given clear instructions on how to proceed. Overall a very pleasant and easy transaction, and in the future would definitely use them for any minor auto work that can be done in the driveway. Very friendly, convenient and inexpensive.< /review>< Rating>

Each time we had Tony, who was awesome. Great customer service, Tony was warm and friendly. He was trustworthy and honest for the repairs we needed done. I’m going to ask for him every time! We paid a fraction of the cost the dealerships quotes us. I love love love the fact that the repair shop comes to you. If there are any delays we are text right away. I don’t even mind if there are delays because I’m home anyways. I’ve been recommending Repair Smith to all my friends!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Cheaper than any other service I can find.
Arrive right on time and very communicative.
No in person contact needed because I can just leave the key outside.
Excellent service.
Unlike other maintenance places, They don't recommend repairs if they are not needed< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Tony was communicative, friendly, explained everything very well, and was quick and efficient. Plus, coming to our house at what would be considered 'after hours' at no additional cost.
Pricing was exactly what we expected, and was very reasonable. I would definitely use RepairSmith again - especially if they send Tony!</review>< Pics>

Super easy to schedule and a hassle free experience. They showed up at my home where the car was stuck, assessed the issue (and overall car health), and provided a very easy to read inspection report. I was not pressured to use them for the recommended repair but sure will be after this initial experience. Highly recommend due to the convenience and professionalism I experienced. Thank you!<//review>

My mechanic, Arthur, made the stressful experience of car repair so much better! He helped fix an issue that we’ve been dealing with for months. He was friendly, knowledgeable and made sure I knew what my car needed in the future as well. I’m a very happy customer and will be using RepairSmith for every car concern or tune up in the future!! My car is working great now.< /Text>

Great! My experience with RepairSmiths was Great!!!  From the easy to apply and make an appointment online service, to the Outstanding and Professional job the mechanic Elias did on my car. Elias contacted me before he arrived. Was on time. Once done he explained to me the repairs he made and also recommended other future services that my vehicle may need so that it would continue to run at it's best. I was and still am very Impressed at the service and repairs my vehicle. I am recommending this company to Everyone as your go to Mechanic service.<//text><GmapID>0x808f7ffd514e0991:0x567eab22c0edebd7</GmapID>< UserId.>

Really enjoyed my experience with RepairSmith. They came out as scheduled and were very professional. While they didn't fix what "i thought " was the problem it was what was best. They actually did a proper diagnosis of the issue and let me know they didn't need to just swap parts for no reason. My car had much more extensive issues with the 4x4 differential so i really appreciate the honesty of the mechanic and the company. I would definitely use this service again.< /text>

Abraham was great. He was on time, knowledgeable about the problem, and completed the job in a timely mater. If the rest of your employees are half as good as him your business is in great shape.<//Text>

I was skeptical about a mechanic coming to my place because I have never heard of a mechanic going out to tour home before...But I was highly impressed that Abraham was very nice and resourceful. He walked me through all the problems he found on my car.  Answered all the questions I was concerned about. And the best part of my experience was, I didn't have to leave my house! Im glad I experienced this. The price that i was quoted for was decent and affordable. Thanks! Great job!</Text>

I had chose this based on the reviews, and they can't lie if so many people are satisfied! The mechanic "Elias" was super professional, knowledgeable, and nice. Was very upfront and helped me with so many questions, fixed my errors, and knew exactly what my lights were for( he worked on a 2014 BMW 328i). Was super convenient and he gave me a lot of advice and actually showed me what he did and what the procedure for my break fluid exchange was for and what it meant. I really appreciate it. I will definitely be calling this company for my mechanic services. Thanks Elias!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808f7ffd514e0991:0x567eab22c0edebd7</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Matriculate attention to details, even for a "simple" battery change, which was not since Mini has their own way of making everything so tightly fit together. Technician was friendly and professional. Final price was significantly lower than the dealer service department.< /Review>

I just recently bought a new used 2o18 Kia Sportage and after the car driver delivered the car and left, the car died. My neighbor jumped the battery. Then I was told to go to Big O tires and get a diagnostic test + plus I was approved to get a new battery. Big O says I didn’t need a new battery. So yesterday May 5, the battery died again and my neighbor jumped started it again. I made an appt with RepairSmith and Julian came today. He explained everything he was going to do but needed to get authorization from the warranty company. He took photos of the car then had to go outside the garage to upload the pics and call the warranty co. So this was what took the longest- wondering where he went. I sat in my car and waited for him. Then he returned, told me a new battery was approved and then he installed the new battery. So the whole appt took an hour and Julian was very professional and courteous.< /Text>

Saw ad on Instagram and found out about this great idea! I didn’t have to drop car off at mechanic shop early to get it done by end of day. Best part is easy way to schedule repair and they have arrived within timeframe.

Had my wheel bearing replaced but check engine light came on. They came back and fixed the issue. Will be using this business a lot more in the future. They are professional.< /Text>

Have now been twice and the service has been top notch both times. Prices were reasonable. Could not be happier with experience. Plus when they cleaned my car after some body work I think they even washed the bike rack. Truly top notch.</text>

Hands down an amazing 5 star team. Amber, Jamaica and Brian are true leaders. They care about the end result from the start. Took pride and gentle caution, met every question raised with grace, support, and delivery. Have never felt so taken care of in a scenario that can cause anyone worry, when there are much details to track. They went above and beyond, especially during a time of uncertainty and fluid change. Jamaica and Brian made sure to do all they could to meet every tiny detailed need, and pushed to meet requests with careful yet continuous flowing time, only ensuring the best. Amber and her genuine support, infectious positivity, are the recipe you need to feel at ease. Thank you to your team!<//Text>

We returned because of the excellent service and outstanding quality of their work. We are more satisfied than ever upon picking up our second  vehicle which looks like it’s brand new! This is the best work we have ever experienced in automobile repair! Thanks.</Review>< Pics>

Fanucci is in my opinion the best Auto Body shop in the area! They always take care of my car like it's their own! They keep me updated and go out of their way to pick up my car and deliver it! I could not ask for better service! Great job all the way around!
Would recommend to anyone without hesitation!
Thank you!< /Review>

Fanucci Auto Body excels in customer service and integrity.  They are friendly, honest, and highly skilled in their craft.  I am still grateful for how they patiently helped me in a challenging situation with my car, and am pleased to offer my highest recommendation for Fanucci Auto Body.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>The Fanucci Team are very professional and friendly! I had never been to this auto shop prior to my accident (my first ever, which I was very green to this whole experience) and they were extremely helpful ever step of the way. They work for you on your behalf with the insurance company and rental car company. Fanucci does their best to make the whole process go as smooth as possible and get your car back to  ASAP. I value and appreciate the level of customer service they provided! I would totally recommend them to anyone.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

My son had an accident while attending college at UCSC. I saw the excellent reviews online and decided to send the car to Fanucci vs. a large chain company. They were not able to repair the car, as it was deemed a total loss. We decided to buy it from the insurance company and repair in our hometown, about 8 hours away. Leslie and Sara were helpful and understanding while we worked out the details of transporting the car. Though they weren't  able to repair our car, I highly recommend Fanucci Auto Body based on customer service alone. It makes all the difference in the world.</Text>

Great experience all around. The new paint job looks great and the staff handled all insurance claim and rental car arrangements to make the process as easy as possible. Every transaction I’ve had with Fanucci’s has been excellent! I recommend them to everyone.<//Text>

The staff was super nice and they did the job in 2 days and it looks great! The only bad thing I can say is they did the job too fast. I had a convertible Mustang rental and I wanted it for the weekend-lol! They are top notch!<//text>

The only bright side to having your car smashed up is the amazing service at Fanucci. Everything was made easy the second I brought my car in and they handled all the insurance details that can be a total hassle. The staff is the best and the work is top notch. Highly recommend!<//review>

I have sent client cars to Fanucci Auto Body for years and have had fantastic feedback from clients. Having an accident and an insurance claim is a challenging time, Fanucci's has always made the tough situation perfect again. I take my truck to them, my wife's van, and now even my kids cars. I am so appreciative to Fanucci's and all their staff, we are fortunate to have a Business like this in our community!< /Text>

<Review>I have no complaints.  Quick enough, paint matches perfect.  I’d use again.  Insurance paid, so can’t comment on price.<//Review><user>101242247155883056687< /user><Rate>4< /Rate><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

<Review>After the shop did a repair I was advised they also do detailing.
Work done today and couldn't be more pleased.  Car (10 years old) looks like new!!  Thanks to Leslie and office staff for their attention (including a towel to dry off my dog).< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Thank you Sarah and Derek for taking the time to explain everything that needed to be repaired on my truck.  Last month someone backed into my truck and I took it to 3 body shops in Santa Cruz to get estimates.  Only Fanucci Auto Body took the time to give me a complete detailed estimate and spent the time explaining what needed to be done.  I got my truck back today and they did a great job on it.  Derek you and Sarah are the best and your body shop is the best body shop in Santa Cruz.</review>

<Review>They got my repairs done ahead of schedule! Prices were outrageous to me, considering how minor the damage looked, but the other guy's insurance paid, so IDGAF.
Edit-- 6 months later-- they installed my window liners upside-down. Had to get it fixed at the dealer. Bumped off a star.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We were at Sichuan Style Restaurant for lunch on a Saturday.  They are very pleasant but the food was not as good as the first time we were there, about a year ago.  We still enjoyed our meal.  All restaurants seem to be working very hard to give service and stay open during Covid.  These guys are to be commended.</Review>

I love Sichuan food and am always keen to suss out Sichuan restaurants where I live.. This place has become my new go-to when I am looking for spicy food with that characteristic 'ma' (嘛) or numbing sensation of Sichuan cuisine. Authentic and good portions. Friendly service too!

The only issue is that we end up ordering the same dishes again and again because we like them so much. We've got to try out the other dishes on the menu...< /Text>

Bought Mongolian Beef/rice plus Kung pao chicken and green beans/garlic sauce.
Prices are good considering that the portion sizes are good. Beef was thinly sliced and tender and seasoned well. Chicken dish was also very tasty. Green beans are the bomb according to my wife.
I will definitely be back for another visit.< /review>

Pre-COVID review: Great Sichuan style food - if you like numbingly spicy and everything slapped with peppers then it's for you! I love the Chongqing 1000 chili pepper chicken (with bone), their sauteed lotus root and cauliflower, sliced spicy tendon, and cumin lamb! Service is great and friendly. Ambiance is nice, clean and serene. Menu is vast with a lot of great, legit, Sichuan options. I definitely recommend this place for anyone that wants to have some great, spicy food.<//Text>

This place is amazing. Every single thing I’ve tried here was delicious. The wild mushroom medley, lotus root, soft tofu are fantastic vegetarian options. The best Szechuan I’ve ever eaten hands down.<//Review>

Think this is a family owned restaurant. I've been coming here so often the past year the workers know me, and its the same people working here every time. The food here has been on point every single time without fail. Huge portions, cheap prices, delicious food, friendly and prompt service. What more could you ask for? Their diced chicken, pork shoulder, green beans taste amazing. Everything else I've tried is good too. Highly recommend anyone in the area looking for a bite to stop by here.<//text>

<Text>An excellent place for Sichuan food in the Bay Area. We decided to come after reading positive reviews and were impressed by the food.

The food is flavorful and well balanced. Our favorite was the spicy peppercorn fish fillet. It was perfect amount of mala. The toothpick lamb and the cold noodle salad was also excellent.

The food here feels quite authentic and comparable to some of the best in the SGV in LA. I highly recommend this place if you’re looking for authentic Sichuan food.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x8085798b49706761:0x83dfdb46c6115489</gmapID></record>

Though most dishes are a few dollars more than ordinary Chinese entrees, both the quality and the portions make it well worth it. You may want to request that they use less cooking oil as the food can be a little oily. Try the sweet and sour fish.< /text></record>

(Translated by Google) This is a great place if you like genuine taste of Szechuan.The red oil is better than most I had in China.Can believe it.

The red oil taste of this shop is more positive than many domestic Sichuan restaurants.

<review>The team of technicians here are absolutely incredible. I have referred each and everyone of my friends and family and bring all of my cars here.

I’ve done everything with these guys. Smog, engine problems, transmission stuff etc. never had a problem or complaint.

Seriously, I used to go to the dealer pay way over price for the same service. It’s true not all mechanics are the same. Rafi and Kevin thoroughly check my car always, letting me know what needs fixing now and what’s left for Next service.

Rafi helps me sleep at night knowing my car won’t stop in the middle of the highway I’ve dealt with too many bad mechanics and now I know when you find the right one pay the right price you get the best service and now I never have a problem.

Highly trust these guys!!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Had a great experience there, in comparison to other shops I have been to, they give you a feeling you are in good hands and super professional.
The price as well was fair and the people seem very reliable and trustworthy.

Will definitely keep going there for any problem with my cars.<//review>< pictures>

<user>113212210116768070619<//user><text>I don’t let anyone touch my BMW. I’ve tried multiple shops and it comes down to finding someone you trust to be honest and someone I can call to advise with. I’ve been with Rafi for many years because I know his techs have BMW factory experience and honestly I feel more comfortable with them than the dealers. I change my oil, check my car, do everything with Rafi. We’ve been going here for years and I would say anyone that wants to keep their car for many years and feel safe driving it, I’d recommend Rafi at autotech. I always get a good price, definitely less than the dealer but I know my car won’t give me any trouble. Plus they always look the car and engine over, check computer fault codes and let me know what I should change ahead of time. I hate getting stuck on the road so I always fix what they recommend. I trust them.<//text>< Time>

< Review>
I won't take my car anywhere else. I am from LA and did not have a mechanic in SF. I have an older Miata which required an engine replacement last year. My car would not pass a smog check among other ongoing issues. Kirill personally took my car for a smog check to ensure it passed. This month I replaced my brakes, tires, and had other maintenance done on my car. He is super fast, fair prices, and is a great communicator of what is going on with the car. I recommend this shop to all of my friends. I won't go anywhere else for my car work. My car has never run better.<//Review>

When I first visit them, I tell them what I want to repair, and I was noted that the estimation of total is ~200. Soon as I arrive home, I get a bill of >3000 including something else. If I select what to repair, eventually it is  ~2500. I feel they want to you keep leave the car there. Why don't they be honest to you at the first place? It would never be ~200.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Date>1583351500333<//Date><rating>1< /rating><review>A tech sought out my girlfriend at the gas station next door while she was putting air in her tires. He enticed her with a free tire check up. He asked her on a date & made some comments that made her feel uncomfortable. After she denied, he went to check her last tire and found a nail in it. Surprise! She believes he hit the nail into her tire. I believe the same, seeing as I checked her tires 15 minutes before she found herself at RAFI Autotech.  RAFI Autotech then sold her a tire repair kit for the tire with the nail.

Seems like a predatory experience. Being sought out at a gas station and then ripped off. Not much I can do here other than leave a warning for others.

I bought a 2013 MINI, and knew it would need a once over. I was grateful that they took me in right away and after looking at it over the morning, thoroughly explained what was in great shape and what was not. Upon pickup, I even got some tips on things like how to change the color of my interior lights. You can tell they love the cars they service and you can bet I’ll be going back there when maintenance is next due. Also, it drove like a gem after their tuneup.< /Text>

I know this place for about 10 years. I met the owner in a networking organization that I was a member of. I had a BMW 740 which he handled many times and always on time and done right. Recently he handled a Porsche of mine and the work was done thoroughly as well. I am happy he can work on Porsche since its not easy to find good people to handle those vehicles. Anyway, it's a good place that you can feel comfortable working with. I do recommend them. Thank you Ronni, (the owner) and thank your team as well.</review>

The service at this place is OUTSTANDING! This is my new go-to car repair. I called Rafi because my 328i didn't pass a smog check and I was on a time crunch to get plates by a certain date and needed a repair asap. He had me come in the very next morning and generously offered to keep my car there while I was out of town for the long thxgiving weekend (free of charge!). When I got back they had already done the smog check for me (at a lower rate than at my other place I might add!) and provided me with the paperwork for the DMV! I cannot stress how accommodating the people who work here are and how convenient they make the whole process! Rafi was extremely communicative, both emailing me and calling me after they had inspected my car and gave me advice on the best deals. He also informed me there was a recall on a part on my car and provided me with all of the paperwork necessary to get the repair fee refunded! I will be trusting Rafi with all my car repair needs from now on and recommend you do too!< /Text>

They call an Uber for me to take me home and when the car was ready they sent me an Uber to pick me up.
They were professionals and with a great customer service it was well worth the price.

When the check engine light came on, I thought it probably wouldn't be worth it to invest more money into it. So I called around to several places and explained my dilemma.  Ronny was very honest with me and explained what I could do. I explained what I was experiencing with the car and he knew exactly what to do. He switched up my spark plugs in about 45 minutes. I didn't even wait that long, and it was pretty affordable. Much more affordable than having to get a new car, that's for sure! I highly recommend Autotech!< /text>< date>

CAR MAGICIANS. Ronny and his top mechanic have kept my used 2000 BMW 528i humming along happily since I purchased the car 4 years ago. They have provided thorough estimates and have mapped out a maintenance program for future work. I've had water pump work, battery, brakes, tune-ups, and some mechanical door repairs -- all performed without a hitch. And they arrange rental cars without hassle or delay. Go here if you want the best quality service outside the dealership. I believe their prices are fair and honest.</Text>

My first visit with my BMW which needed Smog repair due to failed the test initially at another smog shop which are not BMW specialist and the shop referred me to Rafi Automotive who is specialist with all BMW Diagnostic, Service and repair.The shop did call me with fair estimate which I agree to and all the documentation report was send to my e-mail after few hours the car was ready passed the smog test and I got free car wash and free shuttle. I am very pleased and happy to find this BMW place who was honest,prompt with quality. Thanks and I will be back soon for my regular service.</Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Rafi was very helpful. Gave me a free diagnostics for my car. I found out that I have a recall on my car and will need to have bmw dealer work on it. I also needed a battery for my car but unfortunately won’t be getting it done through him due to pricing. $500 dollars for battery replacement. I am sure I can get this service cheaper elsewhere. So overall, Rafi was very helpful and seem very trustworthy and legit. Pricing might be a little higher due to his location in culver city.< /text>< Pics>

A lot of the negative reviews have been due to poor prior expectations from customers (needing a cheap oil change, not having a warranty to cover extremely expensive BMW parts).   I have had over $20,000 of work done in my 2011 F10. All of my estimates have been fair and the work certainly has been cheaper than what I would have been charged at a dealership. Remember people, you have the option to decline work once you've been given an estimate. Do your homework, check bimmer forums, shop around. You'll find no better certified shop in the Westside.< /text>< Time>

Good place to go to when you have one of these Mercedess or BMWs. The people are knowledgeable and service oriented. What I didn't like is that they could not help me with my smog check with out replacing a $320.00 part which may not be their fault but I am not sure if they could not let me get a way with it somehow. I know this place for about 6 years and would recommend it.< /review>

Horrible experience with these guys.  My 2006 Mercedes E350 had noise.  We brought it in and told to diagnose and fix.  They told us they fixed something else for $1700  but the noise was still there.  There mechanic then told us to basically junk the car by selling to CarMax because it would be more to fix than car's worth.  We had it towed to another shop in Manhattan Beach.  They said it was the training and could be repaired.  We finally got the car repaired for $2400.  It's been performing perfectly for 2 years now.  RafI would not refund our money.  This place is a rip off.  Will never recommend them for anything other than an oil change on a rental car.  Disappointing</Review>

Had an older car that failed a smog test, they fixed it and had it DMV approved for about same price as what multiple other places said it would cost to just do a inspection. Super nice and quick!<//text>

Ronny Benor rescued us when our 525i failed the smog test, not because of emissions, but because of a computer failure. He showed us how to get some financial help from the state and did a great repair at a price that was below all the estimates.</review>

My car didn't pass a smog here. My mechanic told me rafi's autotech wasn't supposed to pass me because my check engine light was on when I came. That's an automatic fail. The mechanic took my money anyway, did the test and failed me. He said I had a free retest when I get it fix (like ever other smog test place offers). He also offered that they could repair it, but I asked if I could take it to my mechanic. He said yes and they will still do a free retest.

So I come back a week later and the owner I believe told me no free retest. They had to fix it themself in order for that "deal."  So I was lied to by the mechanic. Over something as petty as a smog test. So good luck with the customer service here.<//review>

Went to Autocheck to get a check engine light read after reading numerous positive reviews here. They kept the car for a whole day and then told me my car needed over $3000 in repairs. When he told me the price he had the biggest smile on his face that I had ever seen. He said the fault that caused the light was the VANOS solenoid and that it would take 4 hours to change it + $250 for the part.

I sourced the part myself for $150 and was able to change it myself in LESS THAN 10 minutes with a simple DIY on the M3 forum.

Don't trust these people. They will rip you off.</Review>

This place is the best for helping people with hardships with food or they need a place to eat, the holidays are here and it's cold out there and there is a lot of people and children that need a little help and love even grace &mercy may need some help or time or funding the person whose in charge is so  Awesome, lodi should be very happy for having such a great person like that, all I could say is thank the lord for such a wonderful place and person like that to help people who are in need< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1616709261085, 'text': 'Hi Harry I apologize that you had to wait for a while for your vehicle. Our technician was trying to work on your vehicle during his lunch break and help our other technician by lifting the vehicle up. His lunch break is required by law and he was doing a favor for a colleague. We service Groupon customers daily we absolutely do not make customers wait purposely just because they purchased a Groupon. We offer those for a reason, not just to upset customers. I apologize again that you were unhappy with your wait time and understand if you would like to go elsewhere in the future.'}</Resp><name>Harry Delos Santos<//name>< text>
If you have a groupon, be ready to wait for 2 hrs. Yes 2 hrs just because you have groupon. I was told that the wait time is about 1hr to 1 and a half. I said that's fine, and I came back after 1 and a half and checked my car but I talk to them and said it wasn't started yet. So instead of going somewhere I started watching my car and it can be done in less than 30 mins. The mechanic (Jesse) also raised the car and stop to put his "hotpocket" in the microwave. Yes eating while working sounds right huh? After he gave it to the other mechanic whete it took another 5 minutes before the other mechanic started it. And they will make you wait in purpose just because you have groupon. If it's not because of groupon I will never go to this shop. Never again, I went with other groupon (car shop) that they will treat every customer the same. With groupon or not.

PS: In the picture he went to get paper towel for his hotpocket before putting it on the microwave.<//text>

<Review>Delco tire not only took care of me immediatly to repair a flat, they also preformed the service at no charge to me. Although I was very pleased, this was no surprise, considering that I have chosen Delco for over many years because of great service. I am glad that they have remained in excellent standing. It's certainly nice to have a business you can depend on. Sincerely CAT.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2984c9a7e5e09:0x1c0f457f92bb5aa4</gmap_id></record>

<text>A long time ago I took my chariot to the dealer for a routine check up. Upon inspection they found two of my tires had significant damage and needed to be replaced (insert blame on the wife here). They quoted me an arm and a leg so I did some research and found a little tire shop on Ventura not more than a mile from my place. Delco Tires had the best deals on tires out of the 6 other tire shops around. So two new tires were expertly added to my ride and I went on my merry way. About a month later a nail penetrated my back left tire and a slow leakage occurred. (Neighbor kids?) I went to my trusty friends at Delco Tire and within 15 minutes was patched up and out the door. A strapping young gentlemen by the name of David assisted me. Much to my dismay, ANOTHER nail found it’s way into my tire (Def the neighbor kids...) so yet again I found myself at Delco. David again assisted, and within 15 minutes I was out the door trusting my tires are good to go. While I was waiting I heard David speaking of karmic vibrations and doing what’s right and I’m confident he incorporates those values into his business. Thanks for the speedy recoveries and keeping my family safe on the road. For all tire needs in the future I will go to Delco.<//text>< pictures>

Came to Delco Tire on 2-20-2020 because i had a nail in my right rear tire. As soon as i pulled in they were on it and ready to help. They also alerted me that i had another nail in the other rear tire! The nails were removed and the tires were fixed in a matter of minutes! A+ customer service. I will be back for sure. Sean G.

Have brought many cars here: Lancer, CRV, Corolla, Accord, Audi and now my corvette. David and Al always make sure I'm taken care of and the guys always do top quality work. Have been too many other shops prior to the recommendation to go here many years ago and have not ever had any desire to go to another shop.</text>

<Review>Informative about tire.  I saved more money than if I went to Costco.  I got Michelin tires and a alignment and bought the special air in the tires and still saved money if I just bought 4 tires alone elsewhere.  Friendly staff and quick.</Review>< pictures>

-You can make appts. Even got in early, got out early.
-Came for a puncture, got out in 10min, reset all tire's air, reset computer.
-Break room has water, fully stocked coffee, and a cable TV (can change channels).<//Text></record>

I own a business down the street from Delco.  They have been providing me and my family and friends with tires, brakes etc for the last few years.  There prices are amazing, not even costco can beat them and there service is even better.  If you need tires or anything for your car i strongly recommend them to anyone.  I have sent countless people to them and not one has had a bad experience.  Thanks for your excellent service and prices guys!!</Review>

He got me what I came for(4 tires), and more that I needed(alignment, oil change). One of the tires ended up going flat later on in the day so I had to go back. The shop waited for me even though it was close to closing time. A faulty valve was fixed no problem and free of charge. The price was reasonable, but the service is what I'll remember. Definitely will return for future maintenenace!</text>< Pictures>

Great place to go when you have a flat tire.  I've been several times and they always patch me up and send me on my way in under 20 minutes.  Reasonably priced.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I have exclusively used the Lexus Dealership for servicing my vehicles.  I started comparing pricing between the dealership and local companies for brakes and struts a few months ago.  I called Delco initially and spoke with Al, who was extremely professional and polite.  When I came into the office the first time, I worked with Sako. I found Sako honest, straight forward and very helpful.  He thoroughly explained what was wrong with my vehicle and had me look at each item as my car was hoisted up in the shop.  Jack services my vehicle and he is equally awesome!  I am now using Delco for all of my car services that fall within their scope of expertise.  I’m thrilled to have found a local dealership with the appropriate attention to detail and concern about me, my finances and my vehicle.</review>< pictures>

<Text>First off, I have been going to Delco for 25 years and never have had a problem until now.  Went in for 4 new tires and alignment in summer, car was tracking perfectly.  Tires ok but after alignment car was pulling to the right.  Returned to have adjusted and after 1 1/2 hours David said should be OK.  It was not.  Still pulled to the right, if I let go of steering, it drifts to right immediately.  Had a flat tire, they said it was in the sidewall and not repairable.  Had to buy another tire.  They could not reset the flat tire icon for some reason, but I was in a hurry and left. No time for alignment correction.
Returned again in Feb for same problem, strong rite drift and flat tire icon.  After 2 hours, David said it was way off (????) but is now corrected.  Drove away and it still pulls to the rite, and oh yes, they have no idea why the flat tire icon is still on.My hunch is they damaged the sensor.  My car is a Honda, the most common car on the road and they cannot fix the flat tire icon or alignment?  David has been great, but apparently their mechanics have not learned the Honda Manual. Now, have to go elsewhere for alignment and reset the icon.  Hope they did not damage the sensor.<//Text><rate>1< /rate>< Resp>

< review>
I've been working with Chris' office for many years. Whether it be auto, home, personal property or life insurance, they've got me covered. The responsiveness (mostly worked with Chris, Cindy & Jose) has always been fantastic, friendly and right on target. We appreciate the no-pressure offers to review our coverage and explore savings.
Not only do they offer insurance, but financial recommendations which challenge us to consider options. We used their auto loan program for our new car purchase in 2018. Not the best rate available, but some of the add-on's made it worth while.
I advise scheduling a early, sunny morning in-office visit to receive guidance while overlooking the beauty of the beach and ocean. That has got to be the best insurance office view in all of Santa Cruz.< /review>

This is my first contact with this office and I am very impressed.

They are very helpful and most of all fast in their response.  Lately with all that has been happening and new procedures in place the response time is longer than normal so I was very surprised when I received a response almost right away.

Thank you!!!</Review>

I have had car and renters insurance with them for years. I feel like they have good prices. The best part is how caring and responsive they are. I’ve had to make multiple changes with my insurance over the last year. Cindy has taken the time to explain everything in a way that I can easily understand. She is so sweet and amazing. Jose is my insurance rep and makes the process quick and easy. I highly recommend this State Farm office.<//text>

<Review>Loved that I could text to get things done with my busy schedule. I just got renters insurances but am quickly thinking of switching all my insurance plans over! Super friendly, easy to deal with, and even if I had to wait over the weekend to change my address, I still was not frustrated because was my bad for switching my plan last second, was still able to get everything I need for proof I had the insurance I needed! Everything was handled over text and email within 5 minutes! Thanks State Farm!<//Review>< Pictures>

Chris Buich, Cindy Weigelt and Jose Guzman make and excellent insurance team.  Every time I've needed assistance with our family's policies, they're always there to answer all of my insurance questions - big and small.

I've recommended them to several friends who have made the switch to the Chris Buich State Farm Insurance Agency and if you have insurance needs, I highly recommend them to you too.

To coin the company jingle, "Like a good neighbor, Chris, Cindy and Jose and there!"</text>

I have been using Chris Buich's office for almost 3 years now and I have had nothing but incredible experiences. They are flexible, responsive, friendly, and professional. My dude Jose has helped me through some seriously tedious and annoying scenarios regarding my insurance, and has made the experience easy every single time. Prices are worth every penny and I cannot recommend these folks enough.<//Review>

<Review>I don't normally leave review's but, I have been with Chris Buich for a few years now and they are always professional, helpful and have had times where they come to me to have things signed. Chris and his entire staff are always on top of their game, are knowledgeable and always ready and willing to help. I called today and as always, I get the answers I need. That's why I gave them 5 stars.</Review>< Pics>

I've been using Chris Buich State Farm for years now and although I've never met them in person (all communication has been phone or Email), they've always been there for me. Whether it's an inquiry, a new item to insure, or an actual claim, they are friendly and punctual. I think it comes from being so close to the water.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I have had excellent service from our local State Farm office. My daughters have been in several accidents recently (I blame LA...) and State Farm has been excellent in dealing with the crashes. The office staff is friendly (Amber and Morgan!) and they have made what could have been a miserable experience painless! Highly recommended. We have our home and rental insurance with them as well, but no claims there, so smooth sailing.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Current customer and needed to switch to new agent after moving to Santa Cruz.  Left 2 messages giving a few days in between and nothing. Got answering machine both times. One message last week and one this week. Bad customer service.  Maybe another agent will be more responsive.</text>

< review>
The worst, they offer a magical quote and for the first 5 months your rates are good then they sky rocket.  When you call to ask for help with a claim, they refuse to help you and send your call to a 1-800 number outside of the state.  I don't recommend.< /review>

I went there for a manicure (full set of acrylic nails). Not only did it take 3 HOURS, 2 ladies that came in after me were taken care of first, the technician (I think his name was John) filed down my skin to the point I bled, refused to do the color I picked out and wouldn't even attempt to do the design I wanted (an ombre of color fading to white). I was so frustrated and over this place by the end it wasn't even enjoyable. The finish product of my nails is subpar. The length is uneven and some nails are crooked. The service that I paid for was not fulfilled (they are PRICY) and I will NEVER go back there again. Horrible experience.</text>

I like to wait to review a nail place until I have gone twice. Overall the service here is very good... the one thing that I am not a fan of is the constant up sell. I left the first time with a $95 bill when I thought I was paying $65. I just went today and made sure I said no (3 different times) to the upsell’s. As long as you stand your ground then you will walk out with a beautiful mani/pedi. Their hours are also super convenient.< /review>

Very expensive, and a gouge.  During the pedicure they kept asking me if I wanted certain services that are usually standard for pedicures: buffing nails, and foot massage.  Having never been charged for these standard services before (at other salons) I said yes.  Turns out those services are all extra, and not included even in the higher-priced pedicure that I scheduled.  The final bill was a whopping $65, about double what I had planned to pay.  The service itself was OK - about average for a pedicure.  But the price was twice anything I have paid elsewhere.  Not a good deal at all, and I felt gouged.</Text>

<Text>This is my second time coming to the salon to see David for lash extensions and I'm in love! They are amazing and perfect! You can't beat the efficiency price and quality. You will love him for sure. I am a pro at getting lashes done.

I think it’s nearly impossible to find a nail shop that cares about the customer service.  Here goes another shop that is rude and disrespectful to customers. Over priced fills, price isn’t what says on the menu and my neighbor was cut while getting a pedi.  Stay away don’t waist your time or money. Lastly because I didn’t get a top priced pedi she did a half a$$ job.</Review>

My experiences were terrible at this place. I just wrote novel on yelp and google won’t let me copy and paste. But trust me save your TIME and money. Because it 1000% will not be worth it. I strongly strongly advise you do no patron this business.< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>The most stress inducing 90 minutes I’ve ever spent. I called to make an appointment for a mani-pedi for 3:30pm and was booked with no hesitation. Arrived at 3:36pm and by 4:22pm there was not a person to be found to work on my manicure. Eventually, two people started at once and halfway through, one technician started complaining about the nail polish I was using. I let her k ow that if she thought it was that bad, she should have said something so we could pick another. Fast forward and coat and a half later, they take all the polish off and start over with another color. The final product looks like a 5-year old’s work. Layers of coats don’t align, bubbles and fix stuck in each nail’s polish, and polish on my skin. This was a waste of $60 and my afternoon off of work. Needless to say, I will not return.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The pricing is not accurate, and way more than it's worth. $85 for a simple mani-pedi. And after that they complained about the $20 tip given to them. What a waste of a nice little shop.<//text>

What a waste of money!! Wife got her nails done and they started to chip less than a few days later!! To get charged over 30 dollars for just your hands and not even last a week is pathetic.< /Review>

<Review>The young Asian guy with glasses who was doing my pedicure hurt my nail bed so bad, that it started bleeding. It still burns and hurts. He was also coughing and sneezing about fifty times in front of me without putting his hand in front of his nose/mouth!!! I'm pretty sure I caught a sinus infection from him! They shouldn't let employees work who are sneezing and coughing at clients nonstop! They put no love in their work and cut nail crooked!!! I would never recommend!!!! Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere! Worst place ever!!< /Review>< pictures>

Stay away. Not only are they dangerously incompetent, but the owner is incredibly rude.

If you're thinking of letting them dye your lashes — don't!  The owner will get dye in your eyes (it burns!), and then — instead of immediately rinsing the dye from your eyes — she stands there screaming at you and trying to blame you. You'll leave with your eyes red and stinging, your lashes barely dyed while the skin beneath your eyes is dyed. And you'll pay them as I did because you couldn't wait to get out of there.< /review>

<text>This location of Whole Foods Market in Campbell is a fantastic location with one exception, they only sell beer and wine. :-(.

The store is on the medium to large size and has a “nutrition section” that I have not yet explored. There is plenty of parking and it is easy to get in and out of the parking lot.<//text></record>

Out of the 5 employees I interacted with while shopping in the store, one was helpful, three were extremely rude, and one was completely indifferent. Such a different vibe from my usual Whole Foods store. This location used to have excellent customer service throughout the early 2000s.<//review>

Best place for vegetables. Great selection and very fresh. Meat quality is also excellent. Not as overpriced as it used to be now that Amazon is in the game. In many ways, almost comparable to Safeway price wise but with much better quality in my opinion.</text>

Prices are much better now than they used to be,  especially with a Prime membership,  but it still seems like I walk out with a pretty hefty bill every time I go there. There are a lot of things I have to get at Safeway, I guess those things don't pass the whole foods test or something.<//Text><user_name>Jeff Thomas</user_name><GmapID>0x808e34c3c8496f9f:0x242f0a73c381c413<//GmapID><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

Although I prefer shopping at Trader Joe's which is just down the block because of the better value, Whole Foods does have some quality and speciality items that can justify the higher prices.</text>

<review>They have got the biggest stay of everything eatable an non eatable items in this area anyway.i just went in to check it out an like a dummy was so amazed I did not take one pic.Please forgive me  I have always liked taking surprise plcs.i had to wait till I was or am  72 an lm starting. Make a longstory short. Go in an just wander up an down the iles. First time visitors, make a shopping list an get the prices on what you would like to buy.Go home an total it up.OK!  It just might be a little pricy , always remember, you get what you pay for, and it's good. Now go to whole Foods, when you're hungry.Keep eating. Byebye LDS</review>< pics>

I would 100 percent return to this store for future arrangements. The birthday girl remarked it was one of the nicest flowers she has ever received. Thanks Enrique!

I go there for breakfast more than any other meal. The breakfast is hot and fresh when you get there early in the morning at 8 or so and very tasty. I had biscuits and gravy sausage bacon scrambled eggs and Yukon potatoes. My total was $9.58 just under a pound of food. That's all I need to get me through the morning. I forgot to take pictures today I was just there to eat!< /text>

It's whole foods, you know what to expect. The people are friendly, prices are a little high..  but lower than expected on some things. Quality is good.< /text>

Love it.  Prices are coming down a bit now that Amazon owns them.  Did deserve the "Whole Paycheck" nickname though... 😉</Review>

<text>Its huuge! I've never seen or been to a whole foods as large as this one. And its whole body section was like its own little store, it. was. soooooo cool, all on its own. Until I went in.

Its too bad, that even though the whole body section was like its own little store, its inventory lacked in a MAJOR way. Really disappointing for the size of this store.  :(

It was late Saturday afternoon, when we went, so of course, there was a line to get in, they were only allowing 5 people in at a time.

I have never had a bad experience at ANY whole foods location, but I didn't even have to go into the store and already, a few of the employees had already been unfriendly & a but rude, in a very aloof manner. Which is highly unlike ANY Whole Foods, I have ever been too, incl. other states

I doubt I'll return to this store location. Unless I'm in the area again. Its far. So its highly unlikely, and the rudeness doesn't send the message "Come Visit Us" instead, it was one of "We hate our jobs and we don't care how we treat customers". The quality of products was just a disappointment. Even the varieties of certain products seemed few and far between. It was NOT worth waiting in line and the store didn't seem as bright, cheery or very clean as so many other whole foods locations I have frequented. And the employees werent as friendly or so willing to help, like so many other Whole Foods Stores< /text>< gmap_id>

This is a larger store which has a remarkable selection of Indian food, hot and ready to take home in their dosateria. I go to this store for this in particular. All whole foods are great for produce and seafood/meat.This store just has this specialty area I love.< /review>

The food is good quality and the staff is friendly and helpful. Very busy all the time but they check you out fast. No self-serve checkout nonsense. Not the cheapest place in town - everyone knows the nickname "Whole Paycheck", but easily the best of the upscale grocers in the area.</Review>

Customer service at this WF has always been excellent. Everyone is friendly and helpful. But the day after my dog passed away they went above and beyond. They accepted my return on 2 cases of unopened dog food and they gave me a beautiful bouquet. Losing a pet is tough, but their kindness warmed my heart and brought some sunshine into my quiet home. Thank you Whole Foods Bascom!< /Text>

Overpriced.... The fresh food is bland which makes it a horrifying how much they charge for it. Yes they have a lot of speciality brands but to be honest you can get the same or if not better quality it your local supermarket<//review>

Favorite place to pop in and pack a meal and some fresh deserts.  Yum just thinking about it makes me want to go buy their in house lemon artichoke dip! To die for!!
Fresh in house sushi rolls, brown eggs $3.99 per dozen... the list goes on and on.

<Review>If there's an office party, I shop for the pastries. The blackberry & raspberry are popular at the office parties I attended. Moreover, also, the freshly prepared pizza is really worthwhile!

Also, there's something about the shoppers  who frequent there as well as the attentive staff: For instance, I left my backpack (with wallet, phone, etc.) in the shopping cart in the parking lot, and drove away.

Hours later, I returned to the store to inquire, and  reclaimed my backpack, which had been turned in to the staff by some kind/thoughtful someone. It's one of my favorite stores.

Sadly, I can no longer special order pet food, for instance and there's no "rational" explanation why for the customer.<//Review>< userid>

< Review>
I really like Whole Foods, it feels like a small family store as opposed to a large chain (even though its Amazon). They tend to have everything you’re looking for and the quality a pretty damn good.
Checkout always seems to be chaos which is the bit I don’t like, I feel that everyone is always searching for their Amazon QR code at checkout and this holding up the line - why in earth Amazon doesn’t make an iOS wallet card I don’t know.

As always, if you found this review useful please remember to like it. If people like the review (whether you agree or not), it encourages me to write more ;)<//Review>

I have the Amazon app but doesn't work in the store for discounts.  When I order food and have it delivered I get the discount. The cashier  today said You don't get a discount.  Thanks for embarrassing me in front of other customers.</review>

Feels that the hot food quality has unfortunately gone downhill. It was actually difficult for me to finish some of the food.< /text>

<review>Food quality is excellent but the prices is insanely high.  I guess the term "Whole Paycheck" is true...  But the major thing that concerns me is that since Amazon took over slowly I've noticed some less selection and more less-than-polite employees.   They are probably being worked way too much but it's sad seeing Whole Foods slowly going downhill.  I think in the end we will find that Amazon buying them was not great for the store's brand.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Tough to rate with new owner. 2 years ago I'd have said something more positive. Employee turnover seems to have increased and sometimes it take three or four employees to answer whether or not they have the item I need or want. they are large stores stocked with lots of items they claim don't have excessive extra chemicals added but I found I still need to read the ingredients label. Hope the new owners get their store policies reconfigured soon for the employees and their customers.<//text>

I really like coming to Whole Foods in Campbell.
The selection of all the foods is really amazing,  I especially like the hot foods,  everything tastes like homemade :)
People there are very friendly. Sometimes I just like to go there to get the sweet treats, they are very delicious!
Thank you for making my days brighter and happier and filled with delicious foods :)</text>

This Whole Foods is smaller than most but does not bake their bread on premises like some of the other ones .
Still it’s a convenient place to come for lunch items and drinks .
It can get very crowded at lunchtime .
The parking is always plentiful .</text>

At least not when I was there last week.

Great improvements overall.  Still need to improve grade of sushi.  Salmon is not good.  Liked the old sushi set up better.

Smaller Whole Foods but set up nicely. The non-food section (medicine, clothes, soaps, etc. is in a completely different part of the store than the food parts, which is nice. Great for getting quick burrito or sandwich for lunch, it's set up quite nicely for grab-and-go. Overall, it's nice!</review>

This location is pretty big for a Whole Foods. Great selection of vegetarian and vegan stuff. The bakery and coffee counter are awesome too. Some stuff is absurdly expensive, but the vast majority is about the same price as Safeway. If you're vegan or vegetarian, this place is your church.< /Review>

Meaning there’s no bar, no mini-restaurant, and it’s not super huge.  But the Campbell store does have a more hipster vibe to it, which makes it fun.  I usually go for the prepared foods section, and this place always seems to have some of my favorites on hand.</Review>< Rate>

Whole Foods Market in Campbell is the first place I shopped with ‘healthy’ foods. The quality of meats and produce are extremely good, but the cost is also extremely high. The message the store gives with their prices is ‘only the rich deserve to shop here’.< /Text>

The Campbell Location is smaller than most I've been to but you should be able to find what you need there. It can get pretty busy there (or at least feel like it because of its small size). Staff is friendly, location is clean, and items are easy to find.< /Text>

Love everything about this store.... except the prices.  Those are to be expected though.  Not called Whole Paycheck for no reason.  BUT when you need good quality ingredients, this is where you go!  They've recently expanded this location and their offerings.  The hot food bars are great EXCEPT the scrambled eggs in the morning.  No idea why on earth they are using powdered eggs!<//text>

Disappointed that they don't use healthier ingredients to prepare their food.  For example it took them forever to offer cauliflower mash, while the SF locations offered it long before this location did.  And when they did finally offer it, it was filled with unhealthy ingredients so I didn't want it anyhow.  For someone who is vegan, you don't take a nice healthy dish like cauliflower mash and then put dairy milk in it.  What are you thinking?  If you want to add an ingredient to make it creamy, then use coconut milk!!!   And then around the holidays, my favorite is Pumpkin Pie, yet the Whole Foods pie is filled with many unhealthy ingredients so I don't purchase it.  I look to them to set the example of providing healthy quality food, as their name leads you to believe, but it's all just a facade.   And their cookies are all loaded with way too much sugar.  For one, you need to put so much sugar in everything.  And secondly, why are you even using sugar, it is so bad for you, why not sweeten using something like maple syrup or coconut sugar!</text>

< review>
Spoiled as I remember how Whole Foods use to be. Now even the food bar closes early, was 9;30, then 9:15, now back to 8:30, and now stocked with broad selection of fattier heavy carb foods. Prepared foods as alternative, shelves empty at 8;30 pm.This was a great store that catered to locals with good healthy selections and stocked shelves. Now since "new" corporate took over they are constantly running out of items, with vacant shelves and the selection of items has diminished. Prices have gone up, I can get some of the same foods cheaper in Maui. Milk that use to be in landfill friendly containers has now reverted to non-environment friendly plastic and the freshness date is now "Drastically" reduced compared to other Organics. The staff remain excellent and apologetic.< /review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>All needs in one store, but the prices are little costlier than the other grocery stores like sprouts. We’ve been a regular customer in sprouts and for a chance visited Whole Foods market located near my house. Really amazed by availability of products as the store belongs to amazon, but the prices are costly who are not having prime membership. For example mushrooms are $5.99 per pound whereas same can be bought cheaper in sprouts. So think smart before buying👍🏻<//text><Gmap_id>0x808e34c3c8496f9f:0x242f0a73c381c413< /Gmap_id><time>1543854840385<//time><resp>None</resp><UserId.>101660294319659292133< /UserId.><Rate>4< /Rate></record>

Like any Whole Foods this is on the high end of grocery stores in terms of prices. They have more exotic and organic ingredients. The quality is generally good and there is a massive selection of almost everything. The store itself has a rather chaotic layout. Its difficult to find what you need unless you've been there before and its usually quite crowded. That said if you just need something very specific and you don't paying a little more its a good place to grocery shop. Surprisingly they have a fairly decent craft beer selection as well.< /Review>

<Text>This whole foods has one of the best salad bars I have been to.  Great selection of fresh and organic items.  The fresh soups are also good (my favorite is the "black bean").  They also have a good deli that makes large sandwiches and also a burritto bar, which are also huge.  The prices are a little more expensive than the usual grocery and markets, but the food here is high quality and tastes good!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Staff is very condescending be warned!. The Cafe service should be closed down because they cant ever get the drinks right. I love the Chai latte and they just always give me the regular latte! Almost always, I have to go to another whole foods to get consistency in my drink :(  Even though this one is literally behind my apartment!< /review>< Date>

<text>I like the juice bar here. They make everything with organic veggies.  I is a little pricy but it is worth it.

They always get the juice out fast whether there are a lot of people waiting or not.

If you haven't tried it yet I would highly recommend it.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>This Whole Foods has the whole body section which provides more choices for supplements and body care products. In the morning, they don't usually stock up on all the fruits. Other then that, it's pretty much like every other Whole Foods. Staff here are friendly.</review><gmap_id>0x808e34c3c8496f9f:0x242f0a73c381c413</gmap_id><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dude really forget the strip club go here..
I would like to thank all those hard-working women out there that are going to the gym and wearing that spandex for everyone to go every witness your beautiful Splendor that is your bottom.  No I never really had this problem before it mainly because I used to shop at Walmart a lot and I never really bothered looking at anyone's bottom because that's all you could see there. But as soon as I came to Whole Foods I realized that less is more.   😂 For example get a bag of chips or some pizza at one of the chains or something else like that that's like mass-produced her basically has a ton of other Cretin eat it and you'll realize you can either eat the whole pizza or the whole bag doesn't matter you'll still feel hungry shortly after. Try that with just a slice of pizza from Whole Foods and you will feel unbelievably full after just one slice!  There is no magic going on not pulling the wall behind your eyes what it really is is good quality food that not only makes you a happier person but honestly I feel ten times better eating here. They say you can't have a pizza day I beg to differ if it's Whole Foods Pizza that stuff might add ten years to your life.  Or you can die in a horrible car crash because you could not stop looking at that woman's UPS Hoops I'm dead... It was a good way to go cheers everyone!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Great atmosphere except near closing time.  I don't know of another store that acts like they want you the hell OUT at their posted closing rather than just not letting folks in but allowing those who already are in to finish up in peace.

Holiday Menu - the Campbell customer service and taste was awful and I was extremely surprised at the unfriendly spaced out staff at the deli / warm foods counter. Wake up Whole Foods ~ I'm taking my business somewhere else!</review>

Nice larger version of a WF. My only complaint is the fresh bread selection is a bit limited, they don't have their own bakery. Parking is a bit of a hassle at peak times.<//Text>

<review>Very dissatisfied.  Loved wf. In the past.  Went yesterday and bought prebagged brussel sprouts.  Most of them had to have bad spots cut out out
It was obvious that they had not  been handpicked because most of them also had some kind of mechanical damage.  Doesn't effect taste, but not appetising to look at on your plate.  I will not buy prebagged produce here anymore.  I like my food to look appetising.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808e34c3c8496f9f:0x242f0a73c381c413</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Older store front of the Whole Foods in the San Jose area.  Word on the street it’s the OG so have a little respect when checking the ripeness of the fruit on hand.</text>

The worst Whole Foods location in San jose area. The prices are Whole Foods prices (i.e., too high) but the quality is a disaster. I have bought their made-to-go meals many times and on several occasions i have gotten sick. I should have stopped going there earlier. Be warned, if you get their sushi, youll be playing russian roulette with your own underwear for the rest of your day.

Good luck

This Whole Foods is a bit smaller than the typical Whole Foods so it has narrower aisles and a slightly smaller selection but it gets the job done. Groceries and meats here are fresh and the service is good.<//text>
