Called them to do a safety recall service on my RAM. Was told "we can't do that for your vehicle". This was for 2006 RAM and it's a safety recall they refused to perform!  Called Chrysler Dodge and they hooked me up with Putnam - what a difference! I won't be wasting my time with Stewart any more...< /text>

Great dealership and such a smooth process. Recently worked with George on the sales team to lease a new 2020 Jeep Wrangler. Amazing experience. George answered all my questions, suggested options I might like and was very personable. This dealership is always available and reliable. Just brought my Jeep back for a complimentary detail and it’s immaculate. Will definitely be taking my business here going forward.< /Review>

Mr. Shami did not meet my expectation for customer service. Further more, he did extend a helpfull service for me to consider my cars to be service at this dealership.
Nothing personal to the advisor, but I will just never step in that department anylonger.

Had a fantastic experience here. Found a new Promaster Van advertised online for a great price on the dealer’s website. I emailed the dealer and asked for the out-the-door price. James emailed me back immediately with an out-the-door price which was free from the BS markups that dealers often tack onto the final price. I came in the same day and bought it on the spot for the same price that James had given me. Easy, honest and a real pleasure to deal with James and Hafed, the financing guru. Thanks guys!<//Text>

John and Stewart’s Service Department get 5 Stars.

I don’t live near the dealership and didn’t even buy my vehicle from them but John immediately, without question, took the vehicle in, discovered what repair was needed, ordered the part and made the repair.  Attentive, fast response and quality service.  The selling dealership couldn’t be bothered.

A huge thank you to John!<//Review>

<review>George Kobi helped my husband and I buy a new Jeep Gladiator yesterday.  He was really the best sales guy I've ever worked with hands down.  Relaxed, not pushing, transparent, good sense of humor, trusting and forth coming.  We arrived completely not expecting to actually close any deals that day, but after a test ride, and letting the basically car sell itself, and pointing out the bells and whistles on it, it was actually very fun.  George was with us every step of the way, paying close attention to our interests and speaking to our values.  He helped us feel at ease, and ensured everything was super smooth.  My husband and I are suuuuper different people, but spoke to both our values with ease. After exploring a few options, we decided to go for it. No checkbook? No problem, he was most accommodating and friendly and bent over backwards to help us close the deal, including following us back home, finishing the tradein there and signing checks at our home. I was impressed not only in how easy, but, how fun the whole evening was.  Thanks George. :)</review><Date>1592931982476</Date><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

Henry U. was super helpful and got me a great deal on my new Jeep Wrangler lease! I contacted him through text and he was extremely responsive. What I appreciated the most was he was not pushy and did not show signs of frustration (like most sales people would) when I took my time to decide. He continues to follow up with me even after I got my car to make sure everything is good. Even if he is busy he makes sure he makes arrangements to have someone take care of me when I went back due to some noise in the car (car was fine!). I highly recommend him and this dealership.

Ask for Henry! You won't regret it👍🏻< /text>

<Review>John Shami is a 10. He listens to your concerns and is a good troubleshooter. Service was quick and they did a thorough and good job. The waiting area is bright and clean. Main reason I go there is because of John.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I have tried MULTIPLE times since 02/12 to get some one there to provide a quote on a lease for a Dodge Ram. A Monica there has told me 5 times now that she will pass my information to a salesperson.

I have gotten nowhere. This dealer is incompetent. BEWARE!<//Text><Date>1613522807525</Date>< gmapID>

< Review>
Horrible operator. The lady hang up my phone directly two times, she ask me to hold on she will ask what they can do and hang up.

The situation is that I forget my house key in the car when I drop off my car today. And I have already walk back to my apt when I realized it. So I call the store, try to figure out some way for me to get the key.

This is such a bad experience for me as of I am still being lock out of my apt and have to wait until they open tomorrow morning!!<//Review>

Service  Department told me it would cost $21 for new widsheild washers! I said Thank You can you do that for me. The bill ended up being $41.....yep they failed to tell me it would ALSO cost $20 to install! Won't go there again!!
..
..OK the following day I got a response email from the Service Manager encouragingly me to CALL him to talk about this review. He said he wanted to make it right for me. Well....I have been calling him for 3 days now and leaving him detailed messages thanking him and asking him to call me back to talk about my experience. After all HE asked ME to call him, right? You guessed it right.... HE HAS STILL NOT RETURNED MY CALL! THE WORSE Customer Service! DON'T go here! It's all about options here that we BOTH have. What a shame!! Very Disappointed!
February 4, 2020...
Still NO return call from ANYONE!<//Review>

< review>
a bad place, a bad experience, I come on vacation of New York to California, very nice place, I bought my Durango Gt in NYC, I have been driving I need an oil change, I call Mopar and they recommend this place for my  oil change, I call this place to make an appointment they tell me that it is not necessary to make an appointment that is open from 6:00 am  to 6:00 p.m.  I arrive and they do not want to do the oil change because the quotas were full and I needed an appointment because the mechanic works 8 cars a day, I am disappointed, bad experience, very bad customer service, there was not a manager who spoke  to me, I come from New York on Vacation with my Durango 2020 the best experience of my life, but in this place they did not want to attend me or do any service to me, I do not recommend it to anyone

<date>1576535636621</date><rate>2</rate><Review>I arrived at 6:30am as I was told that service for maintenance work is first come first served. First, the service center was not open at 6:30. They turned on the lights of the office at 6:45. I was the second person to sign in. After signing in and telling the staff I wanted an oil change and tire rotation, I was informed that I could expect to wait an hour for service to be completed. However, I waited for three hours. I did not appreciate being told that the service would only be an hour. I would have preferred to be told the truth so that I could have arranged for transportation and gotten more things done. I also did not appreciate that although being told that they do not take appointments, there was a sign in sheet for walk-ins and a separate sheet for appointments. I just don't appreciate these two lies and who knows what else I was lied about.< /Review>< pics>

Great experience at this dealership! We were helped out tremendously by sales associate Ray, I highly recommend him. He helped showed us the Pacifica we were interested in, answered all of our questions, and when he couldn't answer, he would search out the answer. Ray was never pushy and was happy to help out. Stewart dealership also matched the best deal we found from San Jose. We loved our experience so much, that rather than try to haggle for something cheaper in San Jose, we wanted the sale to go to the outstanding customer service given at Stewart. Highly recommend this place, go find Ray!</Text>

<Text>I purchased a vehicle for my parents at another dealership. That dealer has since closed and I was looking for a replacement for service on the  vehicle. We went to Stewart CDJR for a basic oil change. Entrance to the service driveway was not well marked and could be easily missed. Knowing where to stop and park was another problem. Upon entering, the service writers’ area, I waited for 5-10 mins without knowing if anyone would acknowledge my presence. There was only one writer at his desk and in his defense, he was in the phone but by the tone of his conversation he was speaking with internal personnel about an issue. It was only then after that I noticed a 8 1/2 by 11 printout on the wall instructing me to sign in one clipboard for major repairs or just an express lube. When the service writer was done with his call, he instructed me to sit in the waiting area until another writer returned to take my keys and give me a service proposal and take my keys. The personnel there performed all their responsibilities and completed the service. Then whole process seemed so cold and so unfriendly, even when I whipped out my wallet to pay (at the cashier/front desk). Look I don’t expect a hug or loving family conversation but it didn’t give me a compelling feeling to return in the future for service or to purchase a new car. In the spirit of the holidays, I recommend that the GM give everyone a pay raise and warm the dealership up for all those who need a morale boost.< /Text><Date>1575480339412<//Date><UserId.>103999471283226452014</UserId.>< Resp>

<Review>Jeff,

I just wanted to write you a quick note to thank you for your honesty and dedication while selling me my new car. I've always been wary of car salesman, often with good reason, but you've helped to redefine the stereotype.

Thank you so much for answering all of my questions honestly, and making that five-hour process not as painful as it otherwise could have been. Just promise you that I’ll be back for my dream car.  I'm happy with the car I purchased, and I'm not freaking out about the purchase price. That's a pretty ideal situation when it comes to buying a new car, and it's all thanks to you.

You can be sure that if I have any friends looking to buy new cars in the future, I'll be sending them to Stewart Chrysler Dodge Jeep, and telling them to ask for Jeff.

Thanks again

We are so happy and very satisfied for the service that Ray Concepcion rendered to us. We got the car that we are dreaming of (Jeep RUBICON 2019) for the budget that we gave them to work on. And not only that they gave us one of the top of the line in the market to make sure that we are getting the best one. Ray did a very good job with all the transactions within an hour. Thank you soooo much to all of the friendly agent in Stewart Car Dealer especially to RAY for making it happen, it’s a dream come true. You deserve more than 5 stars ⭐️<//review>

I just leased a new 2019 Charger Hellcat from Stewart. I was working with David K and I gotta say this was the most painless vehicle transaction I have ever experienced. I was in and out in under 30 minutes.

I had contacted a number of dealers throughout CA and Stewart (David) offered the most competitive pricing and best follow up. There were some dealers that I contacted that I said I wanted to pick the car up in a few days, they said they would call me back and never did. David was available any time I called, texted or emailed.

Next time you are looking at a purchasing/leasing Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram I recommend contacting Stewart..... ask for David K.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>This 5 star review is not for the dealership so as much as it is an accolade for the wonderful salesman that helped me purchase my vehicle from there. Ray Concepcion is one of those salesmen who doesn't feel like a salesman. He isn't pushy; he's laid back; he's kind and enthusiastic; and most of all, he negotiated fairly and I felt like he really understood my needs, concerns, and BUDGET. Ray is the type of salesman who actually cares about the customer and not just the bottom line. That kind of customer service is so hard to find these days and I feel so lucky to have had the pleasure to work with Ray!

I've had the same car for the last 20 years and told myself I wouldn't get a new car from a dealer unless I felt comfortable and taken care of by the sales person. Ray hit the mark, above and beyond!!! I immediately knew that Ray was a genuine, good guy! Again- those authentic, comforting qualities were something I hadn't encountered in my search for a new car until I corresponded with Ray.

So, go see Ray Concepcion at Stewart Chrysler in Daly City!!! I know he'll make your next vehicle purchase a pleasant one and he'll, respectfully, do his best to work within your budgetary needs without making you feel pressured, pushed, or taken advantage of!

Thanks again, Ray C. ! You're a rare breed and breath of fresh air in the car sales world, sir!!!!<//Text>< pics>

Henry was extremely helpful with the purchase of my car. He was able to answer all of my questions regarding the details of the vehicle I was interested in. In addition Henry also was able to assist me with understanding the actual purchasing procedure without having the pushy demeanor which people who work in sales are commonly associated with labeled as having.

To top things off, I had to go back home in order to retrieve a document needed to finalize my purchase. When I came back to the dealership I saw Henry crouched down beside my new vehicle and he was personally installing anti-theft wheel locks on the tires as he waited for me to return. Thank you, Henry for your approachable nature and for all of your assistance. Best of luck in all of your future endeavors. Thank You, Stewart Jeep!</Review>

No pressure affordable pricing and simple and fast buying experience on our new car. Our Internet Sales Manager David K was top notch. Always responded quickly on both email and mobile and gave us all the information we needed. He also returned my call on Sunday evening which was his off day.  Our car detailing was not up to the mark and we realized the same after we came home. Let David know and he arranged for another detail and made sure the stuff we pointed out would be taken care of.< /Review>

I came in for oil service and a recall. And was made to unwittingly sign for the additional cost of a tire rotation. When I brought to there attention they said that they did not perform a prior prepaid tire rotation due to damaged lugs. I still have the same lugs and at the time they said they would do a complementary rotation as it was prepaid. Decline to complete rotation because the “could not open closed work order”. “ I just talked to Walter, we can't refund you the tire rotation since the Repair Order has been closed but we can owe you one at your next service if that would work.”
Be weary and careful when taking vehicles here. I cannot recommend. Although I received good service here when I purchased my vehicle but the unscrupulous ways of the service department brings them down.< /Text>

<text>I've been wanting a Jeep for quite some time. I started out here and met Henry. He was super chill, not really pushy like most car sales guys. I kinda went MIA on him because work and life got busy. Fast forward a few weeks, I dropped by another dealership and they had something I wanted, but the guy seemed disinterested, unfriendly, pushy so I passed on that car. Immediately came back to Henry. He had a Rubicon that had more options and features than I needed, so he helped me look for another with less features and had it on their lot in less than 24 hours. Henry and Jeff (manager) were a dream to work with. Highly recommended.</text>< Pics>

This is my second lease and I wouldn’t trust anyone more than this location ! I came onto the lot and immediately and gratefully I interacted with Marcus, one of the supervisors/ managers, and I let him know exactly what I’m looking for and the cars I’m curious about. Marcus was so helpful and informative about my options and what might fit what I’m looking for. He had Ray, a car salesman also help me out and Ray is just so awesome and your own personal hype man! Ray’s positivity and energy when looking for a car was just so comfortable and you absolutely don’t feel pressured to buy or lease a single thing! He honestly made car shopping fun and not stressful :)! As I found which car I liked, and as Ray was communicating with the managers about finances and trying to stay within my budget,  Ray was amazing with keeping everything transparent and not sugar coating a single thing, WHICH I LOVE !!! (You never want people to tip toe around the subject, especially MONEY) I’m just beyond appreciative that I had Ray helping me through this process along with Marcus continuing to check in with me during the finances and the waiting process!

I scheduled my appt by phone. When I arrived yesterday, it seemed they had no record of the appt. When I booked, I was told Jeep would be ready in 2 hours. Work took 5 hours! Very disappointing. Once home, I discovered they forgot to reset the oil change message, so I will attempt to clear it today from the dash. Sloppy.< /review>

(You never want people to tip toe around the subject, especially MONEY) I’m just beyond appreciative that I had Ray helping me through this process along with Marcus continuing to check in with me during the finances and the waiting process! Overall, the  customer service was truly terrific and just unbelievable!

If you’re looking to kick off your summer with a new ride. Those two men should be your #1 go to!
Thank you Ray and Marcus!!<//text>

I recently took my car into this location for servicing. I paid to get an oil change, a tire rotation, and my check engine light checked. I dropped it off on Friday the 10th, and was able to get in contact with one of the service reps on Monday. The rep explained to me that the esim needed to be serviced and this was the reason for my check engine light. I picked my car up on Tuesday afternoon, where no one really briefed me on what was done just processed the payment and sent me off. Little did I know the tire rotation was never done. Today as I am running a quick errand the PSI light comes on and my tire pressure was on 10 when it normally is at 35. So, my tire was on flat which is a more than dangerous way to drive in the the rain. When I called an asked if the tire rotation had been completed because my tires weren’t retaining air the representative said “that there were nails in my two front tires and it was noted on my service papers”. This should have been verbalized to me prior to me driving off of their lot. The fact that they even let me drive off of the lot without telling me this, just makes me feel as though there was no regard for my safety. They went out of the way to inform me about another matter but not this one prior to me picking it up. Now, I have never had any issues as large as this one with SCJD, but after this I don’t even want to go back. So that’s 195 for two oils changes and tire rotations(in which the tire rotation didn’t get done), 311 for the esim, 211 for the engine check,  and now 400 for two new tires and oh an alignment that was never done in the last 3/4 years that i have been going there. It’s not even the money that I am upset about but them having no regard for my safety. I hate that i even had to write this review, but... I mean I had even mentioned to the rep that my PSI was oddly fluctuating to the point that i was adding air a few times a month. I know that nothing will be done but I had to vent on this matter.</text>

<Review>The end result of getting my repairs covered under goodwill warranty was the best outcome. My situation consisted of a chat representative not scheduling my appointment which lead to the earliest available appointment I made being 2 days past my powertrain warranty expiration. Chrysler corporate would not budge with helping me, stating that I could have gone to other dealerships. In the end the Service Manager (Walter) along with Service Advisor (Norman) took my scheduling effort into consideration and approved the goodwill warranty coverage that would have put me out > $2,500 for the required engine repairs. Super grateful for that!< /Review>< rate>

I never leave Yelp reviews, but these guys, especially John, deserve it.

I have a 2017 Jeep and for the last year the battery would drain unexpectedly, forcing me to jump my car weekly. I took it in to a different dealership in San Jose twice, both times they replaced the battery but the problem persisted.

When I moved to San Francisco and continued to encounter this problem, I called Stewart Jeep and they got me in right away. I explained the problem and told them to keep the car as long as they needed to in order to properly diagnose the issue.

And voila! They found the most random problem ever (lumbar adjustment switch was stuck permanently on), ordered the part and replaced it by the time I got back from a business trip—haven't had any issues since. The guys at Stewart made a year-long frustration a thing of the past and I am forever grateful. Big shout to to John Shami for being forthright, communicative and just a nice person throughout the entire process. Highly recommend.</Review>

Although the sales crew makes sure you drive away happy, it's the service guys that keep you coming back! Stewart Chrysler is not the closest dealership to me, I've had my Chrysler 300S six years, John Shami and the team are the reason I drive 30 minutes north to service my vehicle. They take 1st class service of me and of course my car. I can't tell you how appreciative I am for their service. I'll tell you, be nice to them, even when you're frustrated, it will pay off in spades. Thank you John and Norman and all the service techs!<//text>

<text>Had an awesome experience buying my new car from Stewart Jeep. The customer service was awesome.

Worked with Levan and he was awesome. He’s very knowledgeable about the cars they sell and you can tell he’s passionate about making his customers happy.

Highly recommended.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Overall I had a great experience at Stewart.  My sales guy, Mikey was top notch.  He was super accommodating, never pushy, hard working and gave me a great deal.  The exact color and package I was looking for wasn't available, so Mikey located one from a nearby dealership and had it delivered, detailed and ready to roll off the lot the next day!

After purchase I ran into a couple service issues with my new Jeep and John from the service department worked really hard to help me get things sorted. When it came down to needing Jeep to make things right, the manager, Scott, stepped in and made it happen.

What more can you ask for?

I'm happy to report that I love my new Jeep and it is running like champ.

Thanks guys!</text><Date>1490761943591<//Date>< gmapID>

Just brought in my 2014 Jeep Compass for an oil change and tire rotation and I have to say that was one of the best drop off and pick up I've had in a while dealing with car maintenance. When I walked in the door I was greeted with a warm smile and a great hello. He then called for Norman to come assist in getting my car information so they could get the work done. It's always nice when you come in with your child and the people there smile and acknowledge her too, even if she is only a year old. It took about 45ish minutes for everything to be done and I was back in my car. For sure I won't be bringing my car any where else but here for service. Thanks guys!!<//Review>

<Review>The entire staff was very helpful, courteous and professional.  Salesman Tex remembered me from two years ago stopped by to say hi and chat for awhile.

Although the sales crew makes sure you drive away happy, it's the service guys that keep you coming back! Stewart Chrysler is not the closest dealership to me, I've had my Chrysler 300S six years, John Shami and the team are the reason I drive 30 minutes north to service my vehicle. They take 1st class service of me and of course my car. I can't tell you how appreciative I am for their service. I'll tell you, be nice to them, even when you're frustrated, it will pay off in spades. Thank you John and Norman and all the service techs!< /text>

I was recently in the market for a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and found that Stewart had one of the best selections online. After reading reviews on Yelp, I saw that "David" was recommended, so I emailed him directly to ask about one of the Pacifica's that they had in stock.

"David" emailed me back and told me that it had sold, without offering to find another one, or order one for me.

I emailed "David" again, and specifically asked him if he would be getting any more in stock, or if he could source one from another dealership, but I never received a reply.

Hard to do business with someone who can't be bothered to reply to an email.<//Text>

We drove from Sacramento after a dissatisfing expierence at Carmax Roseville. We call Stewart Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and talked to Jerel about a Venza. A couple hours later we arrived in SF. We were greeted by Jerel. He was very up beat, positive and accommodating. The deal was simple and stress free. The Venza was awesome, as described and ready. Carmax wouldnt even let us see the Highlander we were scheduled to see. We closed our deal in about 2.5-3 hours. They even offered to buy us dinner. Great Expierence! Good people and our sales guy Jerel? Top Notch!<//Review>

They're primarily first come-first serve and only take as long as one movie from the nearby Daly City cinemas.

I recently leased a 2019 Jeep Cherokee with this dealership and had an overall good experience. Lasha, a newer employee at Stewart, was phenomenal! He knew a ton about the cars and really helped me make my decision. I did not deal with Lasha when it came down to pricing out the lease, which I felt could have had less of a negotiating aspect to it. They also have a HUGE selection of cars!! Will be back for my next lease.<//Text>

< Review>
I just finished my purchase at Stewart for a new Pacifica Hybrid.  I have to say, the staff there were courteous, proactive (they too the time to reach out to me first after I made a inquiry on Truecar), and they had a no-nonsense approach to sales.  It was an excellent buying experience and one that went smoothly as well as quickly.  I have to also give a hand to Marcus Ramirez, the sales rep who closed the sale with me.  He went the extra mile to help us out with our Pacifica purchase, including helping us deliver the vehicle (I did not do a trade in so I had no way to drive the vehicle home).  Definitely a class act, and a great salesman.  I would not hesitate to come back again for future vehicle purchases!< /Review>

Their service dept gets the job done, but it's bare bones and slow - taking more time out of your day than it should.

The drop off experience for instance: you shedule to drop off at say 9.30am... there's no signage about where to park your car. You leave it somewhere hoping thats right and head into the office. If your observant you'll spot the signin sheet for appointments (yes really). Then at some point in the next 10-30 minutes you'll be seen (usually well after your "drop off" appointment time). They're perfectly helpful and friendly, and get the job done... but we were spoiled by the quick & efficient service experience at City Toyota, and this is very bare bones vs that.<//Review>

Horrible service shop. Never pick up the phone. Even if you make an appointment good luck not sitting around for an hour. You can also expect them to make excuses for why they couldn't finish your car on time. Or not letting you know up front that it would take more than a day possibly to finish.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Do not take your vehicle here to get it serviced. I brought in my Jeep Grand Cherokee 2004 in to get looked at for a PCM malfunction. They couldn't service the part since it was discontinued. During the inspection, they said there was a leak in the radiator. I knew about this leak, and the car had been running fine for over 2 years with a MINOR leak (multiple auto garages took a look at it and said it was fine). When I came to pick up my car, it shuttered and took a little effort to start. I asked if any thing was wrong and they said it may just be the battery not being reconnected properly. Once I got the car to start, I drove home on the 101 in rush hour. During the drive home the car started shaking more and next thing I knew it was overheating the smoke was coming out of the engine. I had to pull over and call a tow truck to go back to the dealership. When they looked at it again, they said that a loose bolt had torn through the radiator which caused it to overheat and that I would need a new one. They claimed that this was not their fault and that I would have to pay another $2k to fix it. That's not the worst part, they let me drive off the lot knowing that my vehicle would not make it back to the city. I was on the freeway in rush hour and could have been severely injured. My breaks were essentially not working for part of the ride home and the temperature on my engine red lined. I was forced to keep it on their lot and sell the car to a private buyer for a price much less because this essentially totaled the car.

TL;DR: Do not bring you car here for servicing. I have another colleague who experienced a very similar situation which ruined his car. They are crooks.</Review>< Pictures>

Literally the worst experience I have ever had with a dealer. I drive a brand new Jeep that I wanted to get checked out and they refused to schedule an appointment. I called for over a week and even went to the location in person and they said I would have to call to schedule. It took me over two weeks and wasn't successful at even being able to make an appointment. Would never recommend and wouldn't buy here. If they can't assist after a purchase it's not worth it. I'll also report his to HQ as this is not the way any dealership should operate.... I finally called the dealership in Berkeley and a representative was able to assist and schedule an appointment for the very next day all on my FIRST call.<//text>

I brought my 2015 dodge ram 1500 Laramie there about 3 months ago for a problem with my Bluetooth and stereo. It took a month before I was able to talk with someone so I could drop it off. Once I did, they called a week later and asked me what was wrong with the truck. I told them when it was dropped there. So 4 days later I had to call them to find out the diagnosis. They said it was a wiring harness and would take 3 weeks to fix. I never got updates. I had to keep calling them. I found out after 3 weeks that they pulled the wiring harness and showed Chrysler. Chrysler told them that part did not go to my truck. So they told me I had to wait 3 more weeks. I went by there to grab some things out of my truck and it was totally trashed. I found my insurance and registration underneath my center console that was taken apart and in pieces all over the cab. It was sickening. It took 8 weeks to fix a wiring harness. They had to make a custom one to fit my truck. I did not have my truck for two months. They gave me a jeep renegade as a loaner to use as my work Truck. I was fired from my job because I could not carry half of my tools to work with. I lost almost $5000 in income because I was fired and couldn't work. I lost almost everything. So I paid 2 car notes for a truck I could not use.  I was fired because of this. If I could give them 0 stars I would. I am losing my truck because of lost income. I can't pay my note or insurance because I was fired for not having the tools necessary to do the job because they had my truck. Call me if you don't believe me.</Text>

< Review>
Service Dept is tops.
Great front desk, friendly and honest.
All work was done on time and as promised.
It did take a few attempts to locate a compromised motor mount,
but three different shops failed where Stewart came through.
I felt they were on my side, only doing the essential work, but advising me of upcoming concerns without pushing to do the job.
I'm a loyal customer now.

Tried to schedule service for my dodge truck and was told that they could not perform work on it because i had 100k miles on the vehicle. I was told since i had work done on my vehicle at another shop before that they did not know what types of parts were placed on my vehicle. I told them that i purchased the parts myself from their parts department and continued to have a check engine light on. Either way ive never heard of a dealership turning down service on their own vehicles. I was considering a newer truck if the problem could not be fixed but i will never purchase or have work done ever at Stewart Dodge. This my 3rd Dodge Ram and never had anyone turn down service before.< /text>

< review>
I brought my 2015 dodge ram 1500 Laramie there about 3 months ago for a problem with my Bluetooth and stereo. It took a month before I was able to talk with someone so I could drop it off. Once I did, they called a week later and asked me what was wrong with the truck. I told them when it was dropped there. So 4 days later I had to call them to find out the diagnosis. They said it was a wiring harness and would take 3 weeks to fix. I never got updates. I had to keep calling them. I found out after 3 weeks that they pulled the wiring harness and showed Chrysler. Chrysler told them that part did not go to my truck. So they told me I had to wait 3 more weeks. I went by there to grab some things out of my truck and it was totally trashed. I found my insurance and registration underneath my center console that was taken apart and in pieces all over the cab. It was sickening. It took 8 weeks to fix a wiring harness. They had to make a custom one to fit my truck. I did not have my truck for two months. They gave me a jeep renegade as a loaner to use as my work Truck. I was fired from my job because I could not carry half of my tools to work with. I lost almost $5000 in income because I was fired and couldn't work. I lost almost everything. So I paid 2 car notes for a truck I could not use.  I was fired because of this. If I could give them 0 stars I would. I am losing my truck because of lost income. I can't pay my note or insurance because I was fired for not having the tools necessary to do the job because they had my truck. Call me if you don't believe me.</review>

<review>Brought my Jeep in for recall servicing. Read all of the BAD reviews but unfortunately, they were the only dealership close to my house. Within 5 minutes of arriving, one of their goon employees began to verbally assault me including using profanity because he didn't like where I parked my car.  I've never experienced anything like this at a business before.  Spoke to both the General Manager AND the Owner of the Dealarship who DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  I will be taking this matter up directly with Jeep Corporate as it's clear this Dealarship offers ZERO customer service and is a POOR reflection on the Jeep name.  Stewart Jeep SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.< /review>< Pics>

Horrible service department. Came at 2 o’clock pm and they told me I could m not get an oil change because too many people came in the morning, but they don’t close til 8!! Also, I wanted them to look at a recall problem and get a diagnosis but they turned me away to Burlingame Putnam Jeep! Can’t even spend money here if I wanted too, bad business.. wish there was a Jeep dealrer in the city. Don’t waste your time coming here! Also, I’ve tried to reach their service department for weeks!!! leaving my name, voicemails, messages, and had to come in person to get told to go to Berkeley or somewhere, just not there!!!<//text>

Customer service is terrible. The manager is not allow me to do a second test drive. I did first test drive on a 2010 Wrangler and when I want to do a second test drive on a 2018 Wrangler. They said no, because they drives similar and will be better. Please do not go to this place to buy a car.<//text>

<text>The manager needs to keep his door shut. It's very off-putting to overhear the manager talking about you.

I went in looking for a Jeep, and they didn't have the exact model that I was looking for. The salesman was looking up available options in the area for them to bring in. The salesman kept going back to the manager's office, and I could hear them arguing. At one point the manager asked "what was wrong with the cars that were on the lot", and told him to just "sell me something that they already had here". After the third time the salesman got up and left me sitting alone at the desk without saying anything to me, I had decided that I didn't want to buy a car from them, even if they could find what I was looking for. I thanked the salesman for his time, and walked out. Hands-down the worst car buying experience I've ever had.<//text>< Name>

<review>I was very impressed by Stewart Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and the personable and knowledgeable salespeople they employ. My family was looking for a Jeep and I was contacted by Levan after requesting information online. Levan was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable about Jeeps. He was very accommodating regarding our request for an early appointment on a Sunday morning. I was interested in a particular vehicle and felt no real sales pressure for an upsale in trim or model. I greatly appreciated his insight, knowledge and enthusiasm about this brand. When we purchased our Jeep the transaction was fast and straightforward. We were in and out of the dealership in 2 hours behind the wheel of the Jeep I wanted. Thank you Stewart Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and most of all thank you Levan!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Sells cars out from under you. Not a dealership worth your time. Specifically dealing with a Mike Villy. Look else where if you are trying to purchase a car. EDIT: they threatened to have my review removed because I “wasn’t a customer” even though we had a deal worked out.</Review>

< Review>
Picked up parts two days ago to fix my Dodge caravan. They charged me almost $15 per parts that should have costed $4-6. (I called other dealerships after the fact to confirm my suspicion) The parts needed are for a common failure on all 3.6 pentastar engines. Im very disappointed that this Dodge dealer is gouging customers for trying to fix DODGE'S poor engineering. Stand by your customers, stand by your product! Will be making the extra drive to Putman from here on.</Review>

< Review>
Went in with the entention of getting a challenger sales guy was obviously a noob who didn’t know about the cars when talking about the numbers which is what we went straight into he basically forced me to commiting to fantasy numbers which I know and he knows where not gonna happen because I had someone who was co signing considering we had bought to cars from them two years ago brand new hey didn’t treat us like other dealers treat us when we’re returning customers also very shady I asked for the invoice on the challenger I was thinking. About and the salesman flat out said no we don’t give that information out well buddy it’s california law to give it to the consumer when asked needless to say We’re not trading our cars in for new models at this dealership cars are overpriced and there salesman have no idea how to work a car deal or no the vehicles I had to figure out how to use the paddle shifters and what all the buttons do he had no clue they have more Durango’s and challengers around sad I really wanted to get it from them oh well</Review>

Terrible service department. Do not take your car to service there under any circumstances. You will waste your time and nerves to deal with them and they won't fix it for you anyway. Avoid advisor John Shami - extremely rude person that has no knowledge about the car or their policies. They do not offer any loaners and you have to wait hours for shuttle but that is not a big deal. The big deal is that they are slow and do not open service on time. I am trying to make it as quick as possible and drop off my car at 7:30 and run to do other things that responsible people do but they won't bother to open on time. Then you are being yelled and treated like an animal. "Bring your car in front of a door, not there", there is no please, no thank you. Just some commends like I work there or something. Then we have an issue to open the hood, and I agree there was an issue so I decided to pay for service required to do so besides the scheduled service but of course the attitude was a disaster. THE WORST thing that they did thought is that as soon as I left in my uber John called me yelling at me that he is tired of my "games" (I have no idea what the hell that supposed mean), and tells me to come back right away because he cannot pull out the key from the ignition. I thought it was one big joke. Who calls customers with such a thing, but to make it simpler I decided that sure I will go there and do it. There was no problem with a key at all I pulled it out with one hand. I mentioned that I thought it was a joke and that they have terrible service and have no knowledge if you do not know how to remove the key from the ignition. I was already angry and left but of course there was some comments made between two of us. I arrived home and spend money and time on transportation, and all of that just to receive the phone call from the manager but not to apologize but to tell me that they won't work for my car because John made a mistake and did not tell me that: "We do not provide service on cars that are 2005 and older" I thought it was another joke. After I heard that I asked what kind of service are you offering then if you cannot work on cars that are 2005 and older. So I had a conversation with a manager about it and asked for what exactly is this policy but did not get straight answer and I mentioned the issue I had with one of the advisor but manager was not helpful at all. He turned me down and said that he will stop me right there and I have to come by 5:30 today to pick up my car and bye.
I am sorry but I do not think people like that should work with customers. There is lack of communication skills, lack of knowledge and those people have no shame. I left my other cars in other services and never had an issue like that. I think that major changes in stuff should be made in this service. I read other reviews and I noticed that I am not the first person who is being treated like that. Total disaster, no respect at all, and lack of knowledge on their own service!</Review>

We've had pretty good treatment here from the service manager John. He has helped us through some very bad times with our 2011 Jeep Liberty and made sure the repairs were covered by the warranty  (i.e. complete engine and then Transmission rebuild) the whole thing only cost us about 60 dollars!

< Review>
Took my car in a few months ago and asked them to do a full inspection before my extended warranty was up. They apparently didn't do anything because I went to another dealership with an issue this weekend and there are $11,000 in damages. They said the issues had been there for a while and because my car isn't worth as much as the damages, I'm going to have to junk my car. And the worst part is I paid Stewart dealership $500 to change my car battery and they couldn't even take the time to inspect the rest of my car. DO NOT GO HERE!< /Review>

<text>I've gone there once and I've came back a couple times to see if they can help me but every time I've gone in the service advisor is RUDE, highly uninviting and not informative at all. I felt because I am a women he must of thought  I'm incompetent because he talked to me as if I am. I recommend for everyone to avoid this service area and chose a different dodge location to work with.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
If your a car owner from the Bay Area don't waste your time going anywhere else. The Service at this shop is the best customer service I have ever had. Not only do they ensure you out as fast as possible but they will garuntee your car comes out better than expected. John Shami, is the man of service, and the man you need for any questions regarding your vehicle. Ask him for any concerns or requests because I learned a lot from him about my vehicle and better direction to having a more reliable vehicle. He ensures your car is safe and he ensures your car is double checked for everything. So again, don't waste your time and don't waste your money, this is the place to go.</Review>

<Review>We live in Redding, CA and drove down to Stewart Chevrolet to see a specific car they had that we wanted to buy.  2012 Chevrolet Cruze Eco upon arrival we seen car on lot and walked up to it and asked to see keys to start it. After getting keys we attempted to start the car and the battery was DEAD. We asked the salesman if the man we spoke to on the phone "neil" was working that day and he said he wasn't but shortly after we asked that Neil walked up. He asked us why we didn't get a hold of him and I stated we left his number at home but we told the salesman that we made arrangements with you and he stated "hes not working today." Then Neil decided to chew his ass in front of us which I did not find "professional." After all that we continued to look over there car with neil now and realized that the car had severe damage from running over some type of concrete divider or something alike and the wheels on the car must of been dragged down across the curb for a few miles. So we mention this and he states, "Well i had a beer one night and did that with my SUV its not a big deal." And he tells me he can get 100.00 of the price for the car so id be 7,891.00 instead of 7991.00 which is about 2-3 thousand dollar over what its worth with all the body damage. And he told me they paid 7,100.00 for the car and they put 1,000.00 in tires on it "which was an off brand tire that in no way cost 250 a tire. So we told neil that with the body damage the car wasn't worth full kbb value and its in poor condition. They told me they couldn't go any lower than 100.00 off for there car. And neil kept trying to tell me all the damage was ok and he has had the same things done to his car, then I responded telling him "No matter the excuse or reason how or why there is body damage it still makes the cars value greatly depreciate and its more undesirable. So with being treated like me and my wife are idiots for not buying a car with a bunch of damage for an outrageous price, we went down the road and bought a newer car with a warranty and less miles for cheaper than there hunk of junk. If your going to buy from them be sure to do your home work cause they are thief's trying to take advantage of anyone they can.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Phone receptionist (Melanie) was kinda brash. She seems in a hurry and actually hang up on me while I am still talking. You cannot schedule a service appointment with them until the other receptionist (Lola) comes back from her off days?< /Review>< rate>

<Text>I have shopped for 6 weeks looking for a car. Someone I see from time to time is a Engineer in computers and told me about a thing called internet sales. I can call this Dealer and talk to someone who can help me locate the car I am looking for. This is news to me. I called and was transfered to a lady, who sounds like she knows what the heck is going on. I am shocked. She is asking all the right questions and some I did not think of. Ok, so now I know she is sharp. She is Very Helpful. She has called me back with the words, I have found just what your looking for. Does not get any better than this. She did all the work and I just purchased everything I was looking for. Thanks to Toni.</Text><time>1359608848575<//time></record></dataset><record>

I needed a simple thermostat and housing for my chrysler 300 and called the Chrysler dealership in Burlingame. They looked up the part and said it was $50 but unfortunately they would not have it till the next day. They did advise me that the Stewart Chrysler in Colma had one if I could not wait so I went to Colma to pick it up. When I arrived the same exact part was $75 and I told the guy in parts that I was quoted $50 in Burlingame. He gave me a stupid answer saying that the rent is higher at their location so that's the reason their prices are higher. If this is the case I suggest anyone to call Burlingame before Colma if they don't want some crazy price markups.</Text>< Pictures>

Been here twice, they refused to change my break pads, because I had rusted equipment. Even though I desperately needed them changed and said I'd agree to void the warranty on the breaks simply so I can have them done while I save to have the extra equipment replaced. I was given looks of contempt and annoyance, and finally was told out right no, " we can't do that, if there is no way we can guarantee the items we don't do the work." So they sent me out into the public roads with breaks ready to fail. The individual helping me seemed like a legit person, but unfortunately half way through my service he left for some reason, and I was stuck with a new guy who "had to reinspect" my jeep and ended up raising the prices originally estimated. Which made it even more of an impossibilityfor me to get my breaks at least "somewhat" fixed, so I could at use my vehicle with a little less angst. Not only this but I was hoping to get my oil pan patched, down in so cal the Coachella, valley this was estimated as a 800$ job, three patches in total. This dealer here wanted 1.6k+ before I got the new helper who then raised it to neary 2k.

I ended up having the dealer do an oil change and basic maintenance like windshield wipers, filter change, tire rotation, etc. it's been four months since this transpired, and my breaks they said we're ready to fail have held up beautifully, I even drove down to the Coachella Valley in SoCal yesterday to have my jeep finally fixed, only to find out that my filter is ridiculously filthy, basically was never changed. Now, I feel whining about this is petty, but I also feel that even after I dealt with some bs from them I still paid for a service cuz I did originally like the man I was dealing with and felt I might as well get some basic things done since I'm here. Apparently it was a stupid choice. I get my jeep back today, the owner of the shop I went to has taken pictures and I plan to let the serramonte dealer know i was played with. I don't want anything in return except for this places management to puts its ducks in order. No one should deal with petty problem like this from a giant conglomerate like Chrysler< /Review>

Worst service department , they never answer phone calls for appointments and are going to tow a vehicle from lot that was brought there under a recall  that makes alternator catch fire and makes car undriveable, they also didn't to me their was a recall on my car when I brought it in before this time when the system tells them when they intake cars , no urgency to give me answers after they say they are towing my car!!!

Bad customer service by JOHN PAUL GUZMAN AT SERRAMONTE DODGE.
My son called him asking what was wrong with his Charger,  JP's attitude and behavior was very POOR CUSTOMER SKILLS. He continued to give my son a bad attitude and my son said to him maybe this isn't the job for you because your customer skills suck. So my son went in to talk to him, asked him why would he talk to him like that being that he should act professional, yet JP continued with his poor behavior.  My son asked for his Boss, he replied with a bad attitude and said he left. So my son asked him why do you have that smirk on your face giving me a bad attitude, he responded I dont even have to talk to you, your not the registered owner, your dad is and i already spoke to your dad. So my son said Well i came in here to talk to you about your behavior not my car. And he cont' with the attitude.  Of course by this time my son wanted to punch him in the face, but held his cool and said I'll be in to talk to your Mgr tomorrow because of your poor customer skills. His co worker did nothing to help the situation or to calm it down.
PEOPLE LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS BUSINESS IF HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.  HE ONLY ESCALATED THE PROBLEM WITH A DISRESPECTFUL ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR. I AM GOING TO CALL HIS BOSS AND THE CORPORATE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT JOHN PAUL GUZMAN FROM SERRAMONTE DODGE.
WE HAVE NEVER EVER BEEN DEALT WITH LIKE THIS FROM ANYONE AT DODGE DEALERSHIP UNTIL NOW. ONE BAD SEED CAN SPREAD THRU THE APPLE AND ROT IT UP...I HOPE YOU GUYS TAKE CARE OF THIS ASAP.</text>

I grew up coming to King's Market. So 20+ years down the line, to move right down the street from the market, was unbelievable. And still the same family owner, who definitely remembers all his long time customers was a Awesome experience. And the store is a small neighborhood business, and it's definitely supported by us. That's what I love about this place.< /Text>

Walked right back inn and they wouldnt give me a new one they actually wanted me to talk to the rep on the phone. When i called my wife to tell her what was going on and to report the store he kicked me out of the store and told me to hit him in front of the camera so he could have me arrested. I never said anything about hitting him.<//text>< user_name>

Bought a puff bar, opened it and it has juice all over it. Went back they couldn’t exchange it. I guess gotta open them up and try them inside the store before you walk out.</Text>

Nothing better then getting scammed on 4 of July bought an iteam for 1$ charged me 1$ of my card said it declined so I paid with cash. 1$ not a big deal but was it worth the reputation ?<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The staff here is really awesome. If you come here even somewhat often they remember you(I only come once every 2-4 weeks) but they still remember me and are super nice. If you're like $0.50 short or whatever they may just tell you to get them back(if you're a regular and are good for it) they actually seem like they care unlike a lot of other liquor stores. I do wish there cigarettes we're cheaper tho cause the gas station on the corner sells my camel's for at least $0.75 cheaper if not more...<//Text><GmapID>0x809adce201a094af:0x2bce177bc1a032fe< /GmapID><user>108950448511362931979</user></record>

<userid>108032942896966616617</userid><Text>this guy is awesome i live a few blocks away and try to hit up his place when i have money to get some stuff. his prices are good and he is great to his re-turning customers. i have been going to this guy for almost 4 years now and i cant complain. Sonny is the owner and he looks out for you when you're at his place. I even feel safe at night. Sonny has my back. if you're ever in the neighborhood tell sonny you read Hitt's review online about him. he's sure to take care of you.<//Text>< Pictures>

Free check engine codes. Open Sundays. Helpful staff. Every staff member may not be very knowledgeable about car repairs but they do there best. Always sharing any basic tools they have if do light repairs on the spot.<//Review>

Yeah It does have everything you need n their service will get you it if it's not in the store .I had got into an argument with the counter guy. There was at least eight people standing around waiting in line. But his whole attitude toward me was him being impatient as if I was nothing to be bothered with and could talk to me in any type of way. I am petite person I'm 5"ft. So I get picked  on a lot I mean at 43yrs old you would think adults wouldnt still be doing what children do in elementary school. But I am here to tell you I am living proof of such immaturity people can still render. Hey I said I was petite that doesn't mean I am quiet! So feeling the bad vibes and words that spewed out his mouth I told him don't talk to me like that. I told him that I give back what you give to me. I was mimicking his behavior. IT DIDNT FEEL GOOD DID IT SIR? After that he apologized and addmitted that yes he was being rude. He did exactly what I knew he was going to do in the end my car part and apology. Other than this store clerck the place is organized tidy and I like the smell of new car . .. Parts.<//text>

Friendly and helpful workers there don't have to wait for help long. The best is if they do not have the part, they will order it. One day waiting period.< /Text>

This store has a really nice staff that have gone out of their way to help me several times with a smile.  Really appreciated their knowledge and patience in helping me source older parts for my vehicle!</Review>

<text>This is the second bad experience I had with these guys.  Both times I was made to feel like I wasn't worth their time.  Today, I went in to get a fuse.  It used to be easy.  First, the employee that helped me didn't know where the fusebox was located, then the manager came out to help.  They had a hard time getting under steering wheel, so I got under there, and couldn't see and asked for a flashlight.  The manager said "You'll have to buy it, and that this was taking too long, it was beyond their policy, apparently to help their customers, and they walked away from me. He was an ass and totally rude.  It could've been handled better.  Apparently they don't need my business.  Here, I thought we were working together.  Anyway, I went to AutoZone and they were great!  They even used a brand new tool without charging me.  Restored my hope in humanity again.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The counter guy started asking me questions like "What engine?"... normal question, but after the third time asking the same question it seemed to me that his head was somewhere else. When he asked me "which rotation? left or right?" I asked him what that meant and he said he didn't know... ??? I went to  Autozone and got just what I needed without repeating myself and being asked irrelevant questions. I also bought other items that Oreilly's would have liked to have sold me.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808164d84c0a8bb7:0x3980efedbc3754c2</GmapID></record>

<text>Traveling thriugh ukiah we had to stop and ask for help, Cliff was not helpful and because he wanted to ring up customers after us he would not help us and finish looking at our truck for the adapter we needed. He made us wait 20 mins before we finally had to say something.  He was not alone so there was someone else available to ring, his attitude was boarderline demeaning. Very disappointed at the service. Where we live in San Jose the two I go to are very friendly and helpful nothing like this one in ukiah.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808164d84c0a8bb7:0x3980efedbc3754c2< /Gmap_id><Name>Kym Stclair<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user>108341742357195710863<//user><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

The locals preferred parts store, they always have what I'm after. The lines are a bit of a wait but it takes time to look up parts I guess.< /Text>

Got a tattoo with Robert and he was super chill and even helped me out with some personal unsure placement for my tattoos! I highly recommended this tattoo shop and artist! Not only do they have amazing artwork, but they are easy to communicate tattoo ideas with and make the process easier! The atmosphere was relaxing and friendly. Super satisfied! Can't wait to go back!<//Review>

Got my first tattoo here as a walk in a week before my nineteenth birthday. The artist was friendly, efficient and skilled. It only took 25-30 min for him to do a super solid black tattoo with a sharp outline. I've been getting compliments all day!< /text>

< Review>
This is seriously one of the cleanest, nicest shops I've been in.  All the guys that work here are really nice and make you feel comfortable, and they do fantastic work.  My husband and I have both been here multiple times to get work done by Brian and he's super talented and just a great guy. We're both planning on getting quite a bit more work done and wouldn't even think of going anywhere else!  If you haven't been here yet and are considering getting a tattoo, definitely check them out!< /Review>

<review>This place could not understand the work we wanted done and couldn't quote us. We were also told to change our designs to their preference which is a sign that they don't know what they're doing, very unprofessional. We will not be visiting in the future ever.< /review>< pictures>

This is my second time getting a tattoo there and it will not be my last. The tattoos are always done exactly the way I want and most of the time it doesn't even hurt. If it's your first time or tenth time getting a tattoo I definitely recommend Rendition.</Review>

<Review>Went here for my first tattoo last year. I was worried since I was a first timer is get the cold shoulder but Brian was awesome, let me ramble about my ideas and then help me narrow it down  to an awesome piece. Brian, Rawbert, and the newly added crew break the mold and create some amazing work. Great shop, people, and artists make sure you only go to @renditiontattoo !!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Absolute gem of a location. The staff is well informed, eager to educate, and very friendly. The selection cannot be beat. They have such a wide variety of stones cut, polished, unpolished and set, some even obscurely so. If youre looking for a one of a kind item, this is definately a great stop.< /Review>< Response>

Not very helpful.  Brought in a good size uncut opal worth a lot of money but they didn't even really inspect it ! Took it to another place and they were very honest and told me exactly what I had to do to get full value!! Not impressed with Burtons at all</Review>

< Review>
David Burton is an extremely passionate gemologist and Lapidary. His dog (picture of him hanging on the wall) found what was to be my wife's centerpiece Black Opal for her wedding ring. If you're looking for the rare or unique, this is the place and David is your man.< /Review>

< Review>
I stopped by Burtons on my way home from work to take a look at all there gems and such because my wife is really into her stone and jewelry making hobbies once she finds that lil window of opportunity from being a full time mother. I haven't been to Burtons since 1988 when the Dodgers last won the World Series!!! It was a great experience for me,I reminisced with Bob there about a teacher of mine I had in Jr. High at Walker. The class was called "Lost Wax" and it was Awesome! Walt Johnson was the teacher and he as well as the class will always be a cherished memory in my head. It was a flashback that left me feeling happy and joyful. Thanks for that Bob! I ended up buying a gem to surprise my wife with when I got home and she loved it! It is beautiful. Thanks also to the young gem expert Matt who works there as well, he is just a book of knowledge it seems when it comes to gems and stones. At such a young age is remarkable. I would most definitely recommend to all my friends and family Burton's gems and opals I can't wait to bring my wife and daughter in there soon enough see you then guys thanks again<//Review>

{'time': 1588284291884, 'text': 'Hi Roy,\n\nThank you so much for another 4 star review! As a small business, every positive review we receive is incredibly important to us.\n\nWe are very sorry to hear that you still have the same concerns noted in your review from the other day, and we would very much like to address them. Customers are encouraged to do their due diligence when selling any kind of item, and we are always more than happy to offer assistance with a financially open mind. There are many online resources available that may bring you more of a sense of security with your sale. Silvercoins.com offers an excellent silver coin melt value calculator, and the "sold" section of eBay\'s advanced search is an invaluable tool for any wholesaler. A coin\'s year, date, mint mark, and condition all play big roles in assessing its true value.\n\nWe want all of our customers, buying or selling, to leave our store feeling like they got an excellent value and were treated fairly. Our store has been in business since 1955, and we rely on the customer trust and satisfaction we have built over the decades to keep us here for what we hope to be decades to come.  We look forward to making your second visit with us a 5 star one!'}< /resp>

All the employees are awesome, friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The prices are amazing. I love this place. When you walk in its like a hiden treasure. I've been coming here since my mom would bring me when i was a teenager. I wish i could give a bad review just to keep it like my secret. But they deserve all the business they can get. Beautiful gemstones. Gold and silver jewelry. And they do jewelry repairs. If you're into making your own get your crystals and stones here.<//Text>

<Review>This place is beyond amazing.  Their color gemstone collection is huge with prices that are most competitive.  They have in-house designers and geologists.  If you love opals, this family owned business has a huge collection.  They have loose stones and finished jewelry.  And you can get your best jewelry repaired onsite.  I have referred lots of people here and they all have been very happy I did.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

<Review>Amazing and unique gems here. My Fiance got a certified meteorite rock which fell from space and landed in Argentina in 1576, which also came with a copy of the certificate of authentication. She also got a necklace chain for it as a gift for her son, and it all cost less than $80. Pretty cool place!<//Review><resp>None</resp><pics>None</pics><user_name>Bryan Carrel< /user_name></record>

What can I say? The staff is knowledgeable on their minerals, which is a plus because even when I'm not there to purchase something I do have questions on rocks and minerals I find out in the field. Like a stone I found I had thought was citrine turned out to be a huge piece of champagne colored feldspar (still a cool find to me). So whether you need a gift or curious to get answers, I highly recommend them. Thank you for your help, lady and gentlemen. ;]< /review>

The staff was awesome and they had a large, beautiful selection, but there was a lot cramped into small space and prices were above average. Nonetheless, if you want to pay for the better experience then this is the place to do it.< /Text>

He's the most experienced individual I've ever met regarding all stones and Opals and coins. His shop is a joy to be in. I got to hold a little critter that was in a big piece of Amber that was more than 20 million years old. He has top-of-the-line rarest forms of turquoise and Opals in any one place I've ever experienced. Matthew his assistant is fantastic and so helpful. My friend Judy took me yesterday to his store on Beach Boulevard in Anaheim and I didn't want to go home. He can make anything and if you need information or want to go on a shopping spree this is the place to go.Robin< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Don’t listen to the negative reviews. I’m super glad we didn’t.  The bagels are tasty, the fresh squeezed OJ is to die for and worth every penny.  Staff was nice and helpful, and their cheese danish are amazing.  Their cinnamon bagels are super yummy and they have a very large selection of bagels to choose from.  The hubby has had a few of their breakfast sandwiches and he loves them.  Highly recommend ... great place that takes Covid seriously.  Very happy to spend my money here when I come back to town.< /Text>

<text>Yummy bagels and fast service, it was not too busy even on a Sunday morning. The tres leches coffee was delicious, I got a sun dried tomato bagel with mozzarell, egg and veggies and I also got an apple turnover. I gobbled both of them up so fast I forgot to take photos! I plan to go again in the future when I visit.</text><resp>None</resp>< time>

Sad. Depressing really. The bagels are about 1/2 as large as they should be. And they have a doughy, chalky consistency. There is a certain price gouging element to this business as well. I ordered a egg/cheese/mushroom/onion bagel, which comes with 2 eggs. I asked for an additional egg and later saw that I was charged an extra $3.50. For ONE EGG. You can buy a dozen eggs for that price. Never to return.<//text>

The cranberry orange muffin was so delicious. Almost as good as the 1st one I ever had in upstate New York. That one was homemade. They aren't stingy with their "shmear" on the bagels either. Yes too many vmcarbs in one day. Totally worth it.  Oh and the fresh squeezed OJ, yummy.< /Text>

I don't know who is writing these positive reviews, but the food is mediocre at best. Coupled with the fact that the place was not clean, and these are some of the rudest people in the area, I'm just surprised they can manage to stay in business.  I would give no stars if that were possible. Honestly, the whole experience was incredibly unpleasant. 😢</review>

<text>Bagels are offensively bad. Service is hit or miss but usually friendly. 90% of the time your bagel will be untoasted. 8% it's burnt. 2% of the time it's alright. Also, pretty ridiculous amount to charge for a bad bagel. Better to go across the street to La Clochette for good coffee, better service and better pastry.</text>< rate>

Great bagels at a great price. Near the beach and the spot where the boys hang out. I'm also really glad they got rid of the curb in the back. Now I don't have to worry about those darn skateboarders hitting me or my car when I drive by Kappa<//Text>

Their bagels taste like bread that's been shaped to look like a bagel. Not any better than what you could get at the freezer section in the grocery store. Heck, even Von's bakery tastes better than these!< /Review><rate>2<//rate><resp>None</resp>< user>

I think i got handed a kids meal by mistake because the bagel was the size of a cheerio. Certainly not worth $7 . Also, i wanted lox but all they have is a "lox spread" . i tried to inquire as to what that is but they lady behind the counter had difficulty articulating things. I will be avoiding this place in the future .<//review>

Late Yelp Post (1/23/2016):
One of my favorite go-to places for a quick bite to eat in the morning. I love their chorizo burrito, and ham&cheese croissant sandwiches! They make fresh orange juice but it's a bit pricey. My boyfriend and I always come here for a well done breakfast bagel and burrito. He gets the breakfast bagel and I get the chorizo (with egg and cheese) burrito. They are both delicious! I cannot get enough of their freshly squeezed orange juice machine, although I feel like the machine wastes more oranges than needed. Their hot chocolate is also exceptional!< /Text>

Best bagels in the La Jolla and Birdrock areas and located a short distance from La Jolla Highschool.  Very friendly service and in addition to the usual bagel menu they also have donuts.< /Review>

I love this bagel shop, I drive all the way down from UTC if I am really craving a bagel. So much better than Breuggers. They have so many choices of bagels, shmear, and other baked goods and the owners are so friendly!< /text>

Amazing food served by some of the world's best people. Nestled just 10 min outside of McKinleyville, this place is a GEM and a killer breakfast spot 👌

Huge heated tent with walls outside for the outdoor indoor don't think to much about that covid compliance. A proper spot 👌</text>

<review>Neat place for some good food. Tuna melt was great, burrito bowl is tasty, with either tri tip or seasoned beef. The staff is awesome. Indoor or outdoor eating area, bar, and market all in one! We have to try the pulled pork and burgers next time.<//review><rate>5<//rate><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Stopped in for a quick bite on our little road trip,  so glad we did!   Great selection of beer,  both bottle and on tap,  including draft kombucha!  The red root veggie burger was delicious,  and they offered to put soy chorizo on my burrito bowl after I asked for no meat.  We also got a selection of snacks and candies for our trip.   Very nice little spot!<//review>

Awesome little gem. The service is slow but good so I can't really complain. Lots of options for a little store and a great outside dining/entertainment area. They wouldn't let us switch something out that seemed a bit ridiculous for the amount they wanted to charge, but hey I guess if they don't want to be flexible they don't have to be.< /Text>

Last night was trivia night and it is so much fun for the whole family. My burger was not that good last night but I'm willing to try again because the 1st time it was excellent.<//text>

I ordered a Tri tip sandwich with au jus.   I think it's the best one I've had since I've been in northern California ! $18 for a sandwich and a small bag of chips is kind of pricey That's my only complaint!<//Review>

<Text>Wow how this little market has changed! Now Serving great food, great friendly atmosphere,  outside or inside seating, activities such as volleyball court, bean bag toss, play area for kids, live music, and new bar area as well.
Great spot for all ages in a very relaxed , inclusive environment.

<Review>I wish I had taken pictures but I got my order to go and ate it on the road. I was passing through this little town and stopped and am really glad I did. Lots of variety in the store items. I was a little unsure of how to order and I felt like I held things up a little so I took a star for that but let me tell you their burgers are phenomenal. I generally don't eat meat and had gotten it for my dogs to split but after tasting it, wow! They had to share with me. I think it's a great little place and I will probably return again and have a burger.</Review><username>Me</username>< Rate>

This place was really nice. It was small and comforting. The food was really good and I enjoyed it. One thing that I did not like was the employees. They were opinionative and sort of snobish. Otherwise, I really did enjoy this place.</text>

< Review>
Half of these reviews are from when the current owners did not own the store. So they are not even valid.   The current owners are snobby and the staff rolls their eyes if you make a complaint.  The cook who they call a chef thinks she owns the place and talks smack about community members who frequent the place. The place is no unbecoming and I do not frequent it.  When I posted a review on facebook they turned off my ability to comment.  Guess they don't like hearing the truth.<//Review>

Excellent food, great atmosphere, friendly people... Friendly Old Town "general store" feeling, and with the live music... You don't find places like this everyday. Well worth the ride off the beaten path.< /review>

< review>
The new owners are snobby. My landlords at the time accused me of thing based on stuff the store owners told them. They are busybodies and  talk poorly about Wes, Cody, Johnny, and a whole lot of other customers at the store.  It is just plain sad what the market has come to under their reign. Don't even bother offering a suggestion they will dismiss it before you can even get your whole sentence out.  This place is not customer oriented.</review>

Whoa... this place came out of nowhere. It just looks like a bar when you pass by, but then you park your car and hear the country music. No, I’m not a fan of county music, but I am a fan of no frills when it comes to getting a snack or meal in the middle of nowhere. I’m also a fan of very nice and helpful people serving me all sorts of awesome food in a clean, open environment! They have sandwiches, breakfast, heck even pizza and they make it right away for you so you won’t have to wait long. Oh, and throw in that they have beer on tap and a wide selection of refrigerated beverages!? Love it! I even found my favorite probiotic kimchi beverage! Check it out there is even some isles with groceries and I heard they have live music here too... this place is jammin!<//text>

The tiny town of Fieldbrook is so lucky to have such great selection.  We are leaving this review to make up for the ridiculous, 1 star reviews below which were all given by 1 local nut who has gone crazy on our shop as well (with the same 3 accounts: Miss Anonymous, Rory Logan, and Kelly Mosenfelder, posted within 10 minutes of each other).  Food is always great and the prices are totally appropriate.  Thanks also for always being a stop in the local Bikers Against Child Abuse Poker Run! We look forward to visiting for that event at the end of the month.  BACA is such a great organization to support. To the public: -Don't take Kelly/Miss Anonymous/Rory's reviews seriously.<//review><Time>1524497910268<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><name>Sacred Empire< /name>< pics>

I love this little place. Eclectic, fun, good food, great music, friendly ppl.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner!  And, they serve kombucha on tap!  The kombucha is from "It's Alive Kombucha" in Jacoby Creek.< /text>

<text>The owner is very rude. The food is way over priced and the portions are small. Twenty five dollars for a dinner on Friday night that has tiny portions. You could eat at nice restaurant with friendly staff that serves you not just gives you a number like at a cheap diner.  The food is not that good and they don't even serve French fries with their over priced burger. Tony's has way better burgers and pies. They don't allow substitutions if you have food allergies you pay the same price for less.   The cook behaves like very uncourtious and isoften drinking beer at work and the staff gossips about customers. When you make a complaint about anything the staff and owners have a take it or leave it attitude. Unprofessional and very disappointing. Also, two of the five star reievewa on here are from people that work there. That is just not cool.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I camped 3 nights  in Lotus and rafted the South Fork with a big group of college buddies. Jose, Garrett, and Bill were our guides - super professional, friendly, and fun. Request them if you can! I will be telling people about this this trip (and company) for years to come!</review></record></dataset><record>

Wanted to run the Tuolomne but OARS had doubts they would have enough people. Tim kept in regular contact and, in the end, I had to pivot to the Merced River. Rich and Rebecca were fantastic guides, maybe the best I've ever had -- knowledgeable, funny, and genuinely excited to be on the river. Awesome trip! I'll see you next year on some other rivers.< /text>

<review>We LOVE OARS and the knowledgeable and safe staff. The guides are always very kind and easy to talk to and we have been a few times with this company so far. The North Fork of the American river is by far my favorite as far as a go go go rapids trip. Bummed there was no photographers for this locations. But the south Fork had some very intense moments as well and had camera men stationed so you could get professional pictures which came out UNBELIEVABLE!!!! WE LOVE OARS</review>< Pics>

We did a 2 day rafting adventure and camped at the outpost for two nights. Three dads and four 8-10 yr old kids. Our rafting guide Mike was awesome and so was everyone else at OARS that we dealt with. It was fun and safe while giving the kids and dads a the thrill.

I recommend camping on the Paradise Plateau within the outpost. It was a great spot.</Text>

<review>Such an incredible experience. Fantastic customer service, so fun and friendly. I am definitely not an outdoors person and this is something I will forever remember. OARS staff Felipe and Grant provided our group with such a wonderful experience. Very relaxed environment, everyone is there to have a great time. The lunch provided was delicious.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>These guys were GREAT. Went for a one day trip with 4 teenage boys. They loved it so much we went second day on the class 4 rapids. Everyone had a great time. The staff and guides were awesome. They even accommodate a last minute campsite upgrade and the second unplanned rafting trip. All during Covid and craziness. I will be back and seek out these guys at other locations. Nice to find a safe and fun group to partner with.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
This was our first rafting trip as a family and we had an AWESOME time!! We were referred by friends and were so impressed with the knowledge, skills & character of our guides...there were a few other outfits out there today but it was clear we were with the most experienced guides on the river.  Felipe, Slade, Grant & Tom were top notch, each one of them an excellent guide.  (Shout out to Cheri for excellent driving to and from the river!) We were fortunate enough to be with Felipe on his last day this season...what an incredible outdoors man! We can't say enough great things about this company, these guides, or the experiences we gained today.  We're hooked! Looking into future trips already.....<//review>

<review>A fun and adventurous family vacation. OARS is very well run and their attention to detail showed in their competence on every level of hosting this trip for our friends and family. Great food and wonderful places to camp. The Rogue offers beautiful scenery and wildlife and your waves and water offer plenty of adventure. You can also chill on the bigger rafts and let others do the paddling, so it can be as adventurous or relaxing as you like.<//review>< Pics>

What a great place to do rafting. The people working there are very professional, with a lot of experience and knowledge of the rivers. They have a good variety of options, to adapt to more or less experience participants. Their campsite is nice, with clean showers .</text>

Our rafting trip was fun and felt safe. The guide was informative and enjoyable to be around. The rafts were in top condition, the PFD's were in good shape. The wetsuit was a little older. Lunch was pretty good, but they forgot the mayo for the sandwiches and there wasn't much in the way of veggies. We enjoyed staying overnight at their campground after the trip. The campground was quiet and very convenient.</review>

<Review>Fantastic overall experience!

I know there are already a lot of good reviews, but I will add one more. I assume that many of you, like me, appreciate a review with a little detail.

I did the two day (with camping) South Fork American River trip. This trip included lunch on both days. You will probably be very pleasantly surprised at the effort they put into the lunch. One day was a great lunch meat spread with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and four or five breads. As an appetizer, which was swerved while the River guides sliced veggies and setup, they served chips, honey crisp apple slices, and orange slices. Day two was delicious taco salad. Both days included cold water and cookies too.

They cooked breakfast on day two also. Eggs, bacon, and both blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. Of course, coffee and juice too.

On day one, they guides cooked dinner, which was a tasty chicken and pasta dish. Some adult beverages were also provided.

The rafting experience was excellent. The guides really make the trip better, and in my case, our guide Evan was wonderful. He worked really hard to make sure we enjoyed our trip. On day two, we “surfed” Chili Bar, which was thrilling. Evan had to work hard (three tries, and he had to jump in the River to move the boat) to get our boat in this unique current.

They are very safety conscious: a good briefing, flotation devices, and a helmet. Also, you will practice basic safety commands on the river.

The rafting itself was very exciting. Especially on day one, the rapids are fun without feeling overwhelming.  I voluntarily went for a swim at one point—yes the water is cold!

The final rapid on day 2, “Troublemaker,” was without a doubt the most intimidating, but with a good, well-trained guide (OARS has their guides complete weeks of training before they lead customers down the river), you will be safe.  If you are worried about falling out involuntarily, it of course could happen if Mother Nature decides she wants to rock the boat hard enough, but no one on my crew fell out.

One of the kids said it’s like an ride/water park, but on a real river instead of some amusement park. I like this analogy.

Day one was 4-5 hours, including lunch. Day two was 2-3 hours, including lunch. They did a good job with the schedule. Day two is more thrilling, but that’s fine because you learn and gain confidence after day one. Note: you can do a day trip for either day one or two—day two includes the Chili Bar and Troublemaker rapids, day 1 includes rapids like “Satan’s cesspool.”

For the camping, we paid a little extra for the platform tent. This setup was perfect—clean, roomy tent with two beds and a porch. If you like relaxing in the evening while camping, you will enjoy this setup. I did not need to bring any of my own camping gear. They also provide bathrooms and showers (you need your own toiletries and towels).  I guess this is really glampimg, given that someone cooked my meals!

At the end of each rafting day, they had ice cold sodas waiting. This seems like a silly thing to mention, but, after hours in the sun paddling, the soda was the prefect touch and highlights their focus on the customer experience.

I hope to do an OARS trip in the future.

I highly recommend if you are looking for an “adventure” vacation. Our trip included kids, and I think this trip is kid-friendly (but they do need to be able to swim). if you are unsure, day one is less intimidating.

There are maybe 10 competitors—OARS in my opinion is the best option (after seeing the other boats and facilities and lunch etc).  Everyone I spoke with, from scheduling to the campsite to the rafting, was personable and friendly.

Again, the guide Evan went above-and-beyond.  We learned a lot, talked during the calm water, and really enjoyed ourselves.

Final note: please remember the guides work in the service industry. Please tip them for their effort!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The staff was very helpful when we arrived as walk-ins. They quickly got us two on a boat with another family. Juan carlos did a great job as our guide and made it fun and a safe trip down the south fork. They also provided lunch for us. Overall a great company that made us fall in love with rafting and the river</Review>

<text>Great company for a rafting trip. The guide's are very  skilled and easy to talk to. We had Mike and Dakota. Lunch was a generous deli spread and dinner was steak and chicken fajitas. If you camp, it's very easy because the campsite has flushing toilets and showers.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Just did the full day South Fork American River trip with my husband and two kids (ages 10 and 7). It was just about perfect. The section of the river was beautiful and there were several level 3 rapids which was just enough excitement for the kids without making them too nervous as 1st timers. Our guide, Crystal, was awesome and the entire staff was a lot of fun.< /review>

My first American River trip was with Bekka on the South Fork. By sheer luck when I booked a trip down the Middle Fork last month I was pleasantly surprised to have Bekka again. She is both knowledgeable and a lot of fun to raft with. I'm looking forward to rafting the North Fork next Spring with oars and Bekka!<//Review>

Thank you OARS! and our amazing guide Blaise.  This weekend we celebrated our son Marc's 14th Birthday with a Southfork full day of rafting. Blaise was great! She shared stories,  got us wet and helped us really enjoy our trip. Thank you again!!!<//review>

(Translated by Google) First rafting experience with great sensations. The monitors are nice. Possibility of camping on site (with rental of equipment). The price, however, is quite high.

Propane!  Yes they have it... Have you ever ran out of grilling gas in the middle of grilling?  I have many times, luckily U-Haul is not too far and I can go right on over and get my tank refilled.  They are quick and responsive, and they don't yak while they are filling your tank - they just do their job and move to the next person.  Hey, they also have a good selection of moving/packing boxes at good prices - so go there for that kind of stuff - you won't be disappointed with the prices.  Just treat the workers with respect, that is hard work.<//review>

<Text>They gave me a 1 hour quote for hitch install. When I showed up a week later, they changed it to 2.6 hours. First they said "Because we are busy" then "Because you have your own hitch" (Which I told them I did when I reserved). Manager - Lopez refused to honor their own estimate.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Be really careful when booking a storage unit: they stretch the truth about the size significantly.

Our 8' x 6' floor area was really 7.25' x 5.5' which is a big deal when you've taped off floorspace in your room to plan how you're going to pack and have everything packed to the brim.

The storage unit itself is fine - nothing to write home about, but it serves the purpose. But just subtract 6-9 inches from each horizontal dimension and plan for that.</review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I had a hitch and wiring installed on my 2018 Chevy Colorado at the Redwood City location. I was told the installation would take an hour and a half, instead it took 5 hours. When I left, I saw that my rear view camera was no longer working. I tried calling and emailing the Redwood city location, then contacted the Uhaul headquarters, then went to the Redwood City location in person to bring this to their attention. After an hour of waiting I was told the hitch installer would call me later that day. I received a call the next day saying that the rear camera was not working when they installed the new hitch, which I know is not true because I use the rear camera every time I go in reverse. They also claimed that the new wiring added for the hitch isn't even connected to the rear camera, but upon looking under the hitch I can clearly see this is also not true. The Redwood City Uhaul is taking no responsibility for the damage done to my vehicle.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I rented a 20 foot truck for my move. The truck had a bad battery so my 20 mile move took 9 hours
because we had to jump the car. The worse day and moving experience ever. I will never use uhaul again. I should have looked at the rating before renting from the Redwood City location. Beside the aggravation, inconvenience, frustration and hot weather, I spent over 1500.00 for hired help and truck rental and I was given a 75.00 refund from uhaul. They had to replace the battery but because my move was completed.....9 hours!!! That’s all the refund I get!</review>

<review>This location never has the item I reserved and really needs to work on the efficiency of their process / staff allocation.

They only ran 1 register with 10 people in line at 9 on a sunday so it took 40 minutes to get my trailer Even though I was 3rd in line. The first 3 of 3 reservations had issues with equipment not being available.

If you're going to recommend online check in, there should be separate lines for those who have done online check in. They could even be helped outside instead of waiting in line inside for the people who haven't checked in / have messed up reservations.

With 3 guys working outside, it seems like they could check the trailer number via walkie talkie so the sole cashier didn't need to run outside and figure it out.

That being said the employees were friendly, patient, and went above and beyond to try to make things work. Uhaul corporate and management need some work though...< /review><gmapID>0x808fa3a74244746d:0xc1e8b86c89847dda< /gmapID><Resp>None<//Resp><username>Paul Westhoff</username>< Pics>

Reserved a truck on 3/20 for 4/2. They called me on 3/25 to tell me that the truck I reserved won't be available. The U-Haul lady who called said they can call me on the day before (4/1) to tell me where the truck's at so that I can go pick it up!? When I was skeptical to trust them she admitted that the truck probably will not be even in the SF bay area for me to pick up - who knows how far they would have expected me to drive to go get it...< /Text>

Worst uhual in the Bay Area. I  work uhual on a daily basis and this location is on the top for bieng a horrible location to work with.  Managment is awful and its trickled down to all of there employees. They could never answer there phone's even on the slowest days  or even in the mornings.

Even if you scheduled a time with them weeks in advance they always manage not to follow through,  so expect 2-3 hr delays on your plan's.  Again I work with them on a daily basis.

Employees lack customer service skills and at time completely ignore you.

I am not sure how uhual corporation allows this type of management. I will be making a formal Complaint since management is part of the problem.< /Text>

Expensive for simple in-town hauls and long lines. $19.95 is just an advertising scam. $59.95 is likely what you end up paying for even the shortest trip in town.< /Text>

<review>Rented a Ubox and a 5x8 trailer from this location.

The ubox came without any of the promised furniture pads, so we just bought $10 worth. Still happy with the ubox and their service we got, though I did have to move my hitch on my RAV4 upside down so that the tongue didn’t scrape the ground after I filled it. I wish the uhaul guys would have recognized that the tongue was going to be low to begin with, but that’s understandable. When we called the East Palo Alto uhaul, they said that RWC was having a tough day.

The trailer was a bit more of a headache. We has a scheduled pick up but they had no trailer there at the time of the pick up. The rep Called around to 6+ uhaul centers around the bay. No one else had anything. Another company apparently was renting out our trailer, and the rep did nothing to ask them to return it, but when she called the client, the client told her they’d drop off the trailer then she’d have to call me. This put our move and packing behind schedule, and given that we had made a reservation in advance, it felt like a very poor customer experience. I had to go back home and await a call.

While I love uhaul and they’re really unique in the moving business, I’d just recommend going to East Palo Alto or a different location instead of this one.</review></record></dataset><record>

Do not go this place to install hitch. its a nightmare. I called this u-haul and made an appointment to install a hitch at 915am Monday. Once I got to place at 915am next morning, the staff told me they do not install hitch before 11am. Then I was told to come back at 12pm, and it would only take max 45 min to get it done . But when I came back at 12pm, the staff told me that I need to wait 2 hours.

In the end, I was able to find another place at San Carlos to install a hitch within less than 20 min.<//review>

Never ever use uhaul, unless you want to be left without your personal belongings!

After coordinating the delivery of our belongings from MA, we were told on the day of the move that “the boxes won’t fit in our building complex”. We were forced to rent a truck and get them to our new home and return the truck in the middle of the night.

The boxes were screwed and glued, and we were lucky to find nice movers with tools that helped us.

We were charged for ordering movers although we cancelled them (they asked for additional $20 for driving to Redwood City). Uhaul claimed they’ve cancelled the charge, but the credit card company claimed no refunds was issued, so we had to dispute it.

Really, just stay away. I wouldn’t use them even for free<//Text>

<text>First off this place sucks. I walked in the bathroom after an employee name Santos and it was fogged up like he just got done smoking in there. The assistant manger was playing around like a little kid. Not to mention there was about 4 ppl coming and going out of the side apartment or office . It's just like a big trumpet room and I think that whole staff including the manger should be looked at closely. Sorry but get it together guys</text>< Gmap_id>

Enjoy waiting in huge lines. Add at least 30 min to the rental checkout process even if you're doing it on your phone. Still need to wait in line for your keys</Text>

Worst customer service I have literally *EVER* had.
Avoid using Uhaul all together if possible!! I'd give 0 or negative stars if possible.

We were moving from SF to Nevada and needed to move 2 motorcycles (clearly mentioned several times). We had one trailer guaranteed at one close location and it was pulled from under us the week we were moving. Our "reservation" moved to Redwood City (5x FARTHER away) where we were guaranteed the original sized trailer and the DAY BEFORE OUR MOVING,it was changed again. They made an unauthorized change to a smaller trailer (unacceptable for Our needs). We then had to (calmly) fight with the rep to get us either the same size or bigger at a uhaul location within a reasonable distance. Several back and forth calls and conversations included the following info:
- She could get us a bigger trailer for 2x the price but with a very small discount
- "Nothing she could do to get a reduced price"
- She agreed that the guaranteed emails and situation was bad customer service
- We mentioned at least 10+ times throughout all of the conversations that it's for motorcycles and we need a ramp
- We we're finally able to get the originally guaranteed price (remember the "absolutely nothing I can do"?)

Ok, re-guaranteed the trailer at the far location, fine. Paid for it over the phone.

We get to the location and they make us buy a trailer light converter to connect to our Jeep AFTER:
- giving us a trailer without a ramp (because lifting 2, 500+ lb motorcycles up a 6"+ trailer lip is easy...?)
- never mentioning the converter is needed
- saying "Yea, we might have one laying around inside"
- one of the cashiers gave us a "spare cord" that we literally would have had to strip the wires to in order to connect it to the jeep
- completely leaving us to basically wander while the rep went to help someone new
- telling us there "might be an extra ramp by the dumpster"

We finally found a broken ramp that went to a totally different type of trailer. Eventually got on our way, and headed home. I immediately called uhaul to file a formal complaint. I found out that *NONE* of my issues had been filed under my account. I went through my whole experience and the lady I worked with was shocked (she was the only person I do not have an issue with in this whole ordeal). She filed it, sent the request for refunds, and then I just waited.

2 weeks went by and I called to check in on the progress. Nothing had been done yet. The guy I spoke with re-filed it and re-sent an email to the "case manager". I finally got a call (which went to my voicemail) saying the case manager didn't find anything.

I called him the next day and I found out he was the manager at this Redwood location (oh boy), but had to leave my name and a message, since no-one at the loxation picked up and I was sent to a call center. I called again sms someone sis she called him and he said there was "nothing mentioned in any of the calls about motorcycles" which is obnoxious. At this point he's either lazy and didn't actually listen, doesn't have access to all of the calls, or didn't want to admit how bad the service was in order to not refund any money.

I was told I would get a call back from him "later that day" and I haven't recieved anything. I called again today, was on hold for someone to pick up for 13 minutes before being sent to the call center yet again.

This is ridiculous and I have been dealing with resolving these issues for 1 month now, still no results. I am NEVER using Uhaul again because of the experiences with the Bay Area locations in general.<//review>

Monday night I needed to move some furniture and Uhaul was a great choice. Mainly because Nick Lopez took great care of me. I was able to reserve the trailer on line so it was ready for me to pick up. When I got there Nick was ready to help. Normally this place is so busy but because Nick helped I was able to get in and out effectively and he gave me some great advice along the way. All the paperwork was done quickly and he then came out to hook up the trailer to my truck. The move was a pain in the but but it got done. The next morning at 7am Nick was there again to help check me in. As soon as i pulled in he came out and un hooked me and sent me on my way.

Great Job Nick, Thanks again.<//Review>

Horrible. ZERO Star.   Made a reservation for a hitch install a week in advance.  Drove in from out of town for a 10am appt, waited in line for a half hour only to be told parts won't be there til the next day.  I didn't get a phone call nor email letting me know.  The guy was too busy to even care or apologize.  I could have saved the time and gas and frustration.  Needless to say I won't be returning to U-Haul for as long as I can help it.<//Review>

<Text>The one star reviews are a gift to this place.  The service was beyond bad and uncaring.  I came in four days before my move to make sure I had exactly what I needed, was promised I would have it, and then they didn't have my truck where and when they promised on the day of my move.  And couldn't have cared less.  I had to drive to the Belmont store--different management--very efficient, caring, respectful and service oriented.  From now on I will drive the extra few miles to Belmont for good service.  Stay away from RWC UHaul, awful experience.</Text>< pictures>

4 stars because when I got there, my appointment had not been actually made by the call center. However, Nicolas did his best to fit me in to a booked scheduled ASAP and he did a great job with my trailer hitch. I even brought my own hitch- which was more complicated to install. I had been turned down on the install by multiple other shops, but UHaul did a great job and for cheap.< /review>

Day of, no word from the crew. I call repeatedly and finally get to a mover who is overwhelmed and he says they can't make it. I call around and get help from friends and hire a guy on the corner to help. Go the Redwood store to pick up the truck. Its crazy in there. They are out of trucks. I had a confirmed reservation. They have a guarantee. I'm told there is nothing they can do and no manager is on duty so call tomorrow and talk to him to get your $50. Nightmare. I had to find another truck,  pay off the help and move myself. Took until after midnight. Cost a fortune. Icing on the cake: call for the $50 and I'm told someone will "look into my concerns" and get back to me. Later, I'm emailed a coupon. Yeah, no explanation, no apology just a u-haul coupon.  Hey U-haul, please call me so I can tell you what to do with your coupon...</text><GmapID>0x808fa3a74244746d:0xc1e8b86c89847dda</GmapID><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Had a Ubox to move to an apartment Saturday. Called Friday to confirm the box was at this location and they assured me it was there. I  also made sure it could be picked up by my Moving Help on Saturday afternoon rather than the morning. Saturday comes and they have no trucks for my Moving Help to use, we wait until Sunday. Turns out the box is in Santa Clara even though I called to check that it was at this location. Now I can't move in until next week.  Huge waste of time for me and my Moving Help.<//review>

<Review>DO NOT Rent here unless you are ridiculousy rich and just want to throw away your hard earned money. Not to mention the worse service I've ever received , from rude remarks and lies just to upsale me. To make a long story short I was charged nearly $600 dollars for a one day rental. There is simply no excuse for such high way robbery. Charge my card the very next day for being two hours late I had to pay for another day.</Review>< rate>

Do not go here.  I went to empty out a locker.  There were two people in front of of me in line.  It took 40 minutes for me JUST to get entry to the locker so I could close it out.  When, 5 minutes later, I returned to the office, to tell them the locker was empty, the manager told me I had to go to the back of the line again (now over an hour long) just for my 30 second close out.  It was, incredibly enough, worse than the DMV.  Problems at the location are:
1.  Rude service and incompetent management--particularly by manager Nicolas Lopez--that badmouths its own business, makes no apologies for delays, and makes no effort to move things along.  La-di-dah.  Who cares if people are waiting for over an hour?
2.  Computer systems that are slower than those of the 1990's and simply do not work.
3.  Poorly maintained locker areas with rat traps everywhere.  There is so much storage around.  Why would anyone go here when there are nice places elsewhere at similar rates?
4.  Impossible website.  We tried to set up something up by phone before I arrived.  After 10 minutes, they sent us to the website.  After 30 minutes of struggling, we couldn't do what was suggested.   We called back.  15 seconds later, things were fixed.  Really?   We had to go this route.

Really, don't go here.  Don't go to Uhaul at all.  And President Don Thompson, either train your staff or get better people.<//review>

The yard staff was fine, but the counter is understaffed and the help I received was incompetent.

I needed a trailer, so I waited in line for an hour, they were out of stock but I got the clerk (new at his job, I hope) to reserve me one for same location, next day.

Next day, I'm second in line, and Lanay tells me to go move my car (apparently the person in front of me and behind me were fine, and she had no idea where I was parked).  I walk outside for a minute, do nothing, walk back inside, verifies I've moved my car.  Sure.  She skips me in line and helps the gentleman behind me in line (also there for a trailer).

By the time I get helped, they realize they don't have the trailer in stock (that they reserved, themselves, the day prior).  They offer me a free upgrade to a 6x12.  They send me out to have the yard guy inspect my vehicle, which didn't have the electrical hookups in an obvious place.  Rather than offering to sell them to me or install them for me, or give me a reason why they can't, they send me away (Belmont Uhaul was not only deserted of customers with 3 friendly staff but they also sold me the kit and told me it was easy to install, which it pretty much was).  Unfortunately Belmont didn't have any trailers available so it was back to RWC to finally get hooked up.

This place would be two or three stars if it wasn't such a madhouse full of people.  I'd go to Belmont first next time.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Service is slow, they don't return calls in a decent time. They will deliver the reserved truck at the quoted price.<//Review>

<review>the place is awful. I checked in with self-check box, but they left me a wrong key. The second day, I returned the wrong key and the employee told me that it would not be charge. But they charged the rental fee and one mile plus?????? EVEN I didn't open the van door？？<//review>< Response>

This U-haul location provided me with literally the WORST experience I have ever had as a consumer. This sounds like an exaggeration so let me explain:

We had a problem with our gas gauge being inaccurate and were unable to tell if the truck was at the right level. We told the owner named Alex and he said he would file a complaint and help us. Well after I gave him the information on my complaint I did not hear back from him for 3 days. He went ahead and charged us to completely fill the truck and he charged us a $30 'filling fee' which is crazy b/c he also owns the gas station next door.

I tried to contact him many times (documented) and never got a response. After I finally got Alex on the phone he told me he would not help me file a complaint because I checked the 'would not recommend' tab on my online review of his drop off location.

After I told him he was simply proving me right, he went insane with rage. He CURSED AT ME AND THREATENED ME. (Calling me things like 'M-F-er' and 'B') He said If I want to be a tough guy I should come down and see him and he would show me (threatening me with bodily harm). I hung up after a few seconds of his childish outburst and immediately called U-haul. They assured me they would not send people to the location until 'they spoke with him about it' but I fear this very unstable man is still allowed to run his business.

Because of this I feel it is important for me to warn future U-haul customers of this atrocious incident. Needless to say, thanks to Mr. Alex I will be renting from Penske or Enterprise for the rest of my life.< /review>< username>

<rating>1</rating><text>Terrible experience shipping a U-box from Austin, TX into Redwood City, CA. The incredibly impolite woman who picked up the phone at the Redwood City location grudgingly told me that, even when my U-box was dropped at U-haul in Austin since April 27th, they could not confirm if it would be in Redwood City by the estimated date of May 15th and that I should "keep calling". The box doesn't even show as incoming, so they essentially do not know where it is. After I said that was unacceptable, she yelled me the number for corporate customer service. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this company and their services (or lack of, to be more accurate).<//text>< Pictures>

Absolutely terrible customer service. Had many different issues, including them trying to take money from me and having trouble getting in contact with customer support (or ANYONE) to get it resolved. Waited hours for my rental truck and got it with less than a quarter tank. Will never use u-haul again<//review>

Even with a reservation, checking in and getting the vehicle can take a while. The parking lot is usually full, including vehicles that are neither rentals nor customer vehicles. Often times, this means that you'll have trouble parking, reservation or not.</review>

<Review>The staff was unhelpful and everyone that worked there obviously didn't want to be there. Everyone there where gangster hood-rat types with their pants sagged and they all kind of looked (and talked) like they were going to rob a liquor store after work. It was very unprofessional to say the least and I felt sort of unsafe. I will not go back to that location.</Review>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I only went to fill my gas tank for the grill, the service was very fast because I paid by card, it is a little longer if you pay in cash.

< Review>
John Muir called these The Range of Light and spent most of his life in them. Stretching 400 miles North to South with 22 passes and only 3 of those being open/maintained in the Winter due to heavy snowfall. There is a 137 mile stretch with no crossing roads at all. The Pacific Crest Trail runs on them. I was raised in them on the Western side. To me they are everything a mountain range should be~Beautful, remote, many different landscapes, some which are very hard to access.<//Review>

Beautifully kept up. Midweek there is plenty of tables and bbq pits. Not far to drive from Fresno. Camping sites have everything with 24hr on site assistance. Thank you Shirley.< /Review>

I love the Eastern Sierra. I have been going there all my life, and I try to visit to ski 10 trips a year to Mammoth and about 6 trips a year camping. It is where I go when I want to "get away from it all".</review>

Stretching 400 miles North to South with 22 passes and only 3 of those being open/maintained in the Winter due to heavy snowfall. There is a 137 mile stretch with no crossing roads at all. The Pacific Crest Trail runs on them. I was raised in them on the Western side. To me they are everything a mountain range should be~Beautful, remote, many different landscapes, some which are very hard to access.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-EWxR6k_VmB2ZPRAgp6sTvfyfNEqwYKLsqq7u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn8OflZNYfcriu-Q1cf4VOcrNBHcDxQGBzGv30=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdVaBrGwGGxcb519J-f_5160ylpDql6aPPgK_K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU8mPXjvy7qzudWXHqOsY9GJe7-qgR9AEZMrMm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS1FD4ZEC5rM5EHJ95SL_OF-6FDQAdsneFLIW0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCjDvG5yc8GzyG6lVZpsLz15Nve51W8toeuRog=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXP3uCwZn12sj31eCDqdRWQ5sA6rWliEtGIp33=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2kUKgqckR0WDE35pI7aFGODEm5Vb8D54eRJJf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK0JmDzT4ly5DrTMN68zUpnQUVatdGAH8s2Wxn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLy4DRQq_kXTuXjrPYyzYBZD0kM7VX7Hx0rDyz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjbT4-etwEAa_RzbWXQnJLHuSIAYzwHyufXneX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><rating>5</rating></record>

Many beautiful mountains, campgrounds, ski resorts, and small towns tucked away in these mountains. I've personally lived more than five years in these mountains, and can say I'll never get tired of them.< /text>

How do review a mountain?!?! I mean it's beautiful, fun, dangerous and breathtaking. When traveling threw the mountains it's very important to drive prepared. Especially in the winter time. People have been killed in their cars when trying to sit threw a sudden snow storm. Always pack food and water, even if you're just driving threw. There are many places to stop along the way for supplies before you head into the mountains so do it. CAMPERS: Please contact local Rangers when choosing a camp ground. Some places are open to the public and some are not. ALWAYS GET A FIRE PERMIT BEFORE YOU CAMP. Otherwise you can get a ticket. Enjoy the amazing mountains but be wise.<//review>

Summer time is the best time to see the natural wonders of the High Sierras from Yosemite, Mammoth and all the side roads to rivers, lakes and big mountains! Don't forget to go to old ghost town Bodie, see how people lived 100 years ago mining!</Text>

<Review>Always a pleasure to visit our foothills. Being up here it's hard to believe your in CA. With all its insanity, but northern CA is very different from South, and for me it's best. Get up there and get some peace of mind.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This is one of the great mountain ranges in the world. High peaks, deep valleys, clear lakes and cold streams. I have been coming here as a kid and will bring my grandkids.  Just last week came in with my horse and had a wonderful campout. The sights to be seen are something I wish everyone could see. Plan a trip sometime to see the wonders this place has to offer.<//Review>< Pics>

The terrain was exceptionally beautiful in the spring months and made for a amazingly beautiful and pleasant drive. We stopped at many of the places along the drive to stretch our legs and at each place we found beautiful beyond belief.  I highly recommend this trip to anyone who enjoys natural beauty and fresh air.</Review>< Pics>

There's nothing more satisfying than getting away from the madness of the city and heading to wilderness. Toy will honestly feel rejuvenated, but you have to stay for at least 5 days to really understand the secret of how nature cures all unpleasantries of daily city stress.</text>

<text>What's not to say about the the most beautiful mountain range in California. It is stupendous. It is the home of our beautiful Lake Tahoe. One of the best places in the state. The Sierra Nevada mountains is also the home of the most beautiful national park in the world. Beautiful Yosemite National Park. Where you could spend a month and still not see all of the wonderful places it has to offer. Plus all the water falls are gushing right now. That's only a couple of things it has to offer. There is still so much more. How about Mount Shasta and Shasta Lake among a few.< /text><user_name>Pete Bagnod</user_name>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5< /rate><review>The Sierra Nevada mountain range is so unique and has interests for everyone.  Snow capped most of the year, there is always a beautiful background.  The awesome redwoods that seem to reach the sky.  Yosemite with its huge granite peaks to spectacular waterfalls to the Merced River.  Mt.Whitney Portal is a must see.  Only then do you get to appreciate the massive Sierra Nevada.</review>< Pictures>

The only time in my life I've ever seen wild horses running free was when I was driving across the Sierra Nevadas.  It was stunning as I realized what it was.  Strength and beauty, as these wild and free creatures blazed across the horizon off to my right.  Freaky.  I loved it so much I had to put it in a song.  It was one of the coolest things I've ever seen, but hard to explain to where you could ever feel what I did when I actually saw it.  Unusual freedom.  Thank God.</Review>

<review>These mountains have it all, wildlife, awesome mountain towns, even ghost towns! Lots of places to fish from lakes and ponds to creeks and rivers, wolves are even making their way back into these mountains, you can find much history here, from the Gold Rush era and the tragic tale of the Donner party, and dont forget about BIGFOOT!( they are real!)<//review>< pics>

Beautiful drive and especially now the lakes are filling up.. but if you're not used to the heat or can't live without your cell phone.. it could seem like it takes forever to get through the drive to Yosemite .< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Beautiful and clean air and water.  Good place to unplug. Not the smartest people in the world but usually welcoming and their hart is in the right place. Which is a lot more than I can say for a lot of the county. Tons of outdoors activities. Camping, trails, hiking, mountain biking, fishing, off road 4x4 vehicles and dirt biking, year round things to do everywhere. Family and solo adventures and fun. Stay in town at a hotel or RV park or one of the many campsites with complete RV hookups. Better enjoy it while you can! Public lands like this are currently being sold off to the mining industry, among others.<//Text>< Response>

My favorite mountain range! Beautiful & Rugged.  But be sure to bring extra food if contemplating a winter crossing, it can be unforgiving! No trendy crowds or handicapped parking.
Come on Google! What kind of review were you expecting for a mountain range?</text>

There are a plethora of camping facilities located within the range,  Some of which have restrooms. The best part of the Sierra Nevada mountains are the views.  From the peaks of this mountain range you can see all the way to the coastal mountain range or to the massive expanse the Mojave.  If you are an adventure nut this is your place. Also, in the Kern river area the Air Force flies jets through the area on a daily basis, so if you are an aerojunkie find your way to the peaks and wait for the show</Review>< Pics>

You may not want to stay very long for a visit cuz people often notice how short the distance if a city dweller feller were to travel in 3 of the 4 directions he may choose to travel or if he didn't live in this big huge valley"... Air quality good with blue skies often, cept for Bako & the many square miles that sure arrounds us?!< /Text>

One of North America's major ranges can not possibly be described in a review. We are talking about 1/4 or so of the State of California! Thousands of communities from the foothills to the alpine tundra, and over to the desert steppe of the Great Basin and Mojave. Casinos and snow bunnies to hardscrabble mining, logging and agricultural towns. Ghost towns, and somewhere is John C Fremont's lost cannon. And Yosemite national park, among other national parks. Human history, genocide and disaster. And the sublime, including the highest peak in the lower 48, Devil's Postpile, Mammoth. From Susanville through Truckee to Bishop and Tehachepe, you can't scratch the surface of it.</Review>

I live in the Eastern Sierra Nevada.  In a tourist town called Bishop, CA.  There are numerous 14,000 peak mountains Mt Whitney is only 45 miles south of Bishop.  This is God's Country, with many lakes ,and streams and adventures waiting to happen. Take 395 out of  Los Angeles freeway system south approximate travel time 4 hours to Bishop, CA on highway 395.  Or come north 395 out of Carson City, Reno, Nevada. It doesnt matter how you get here, you won't ever regret it.  Everyone loves the Sierra Nevada.</review>

Sometimes you just need to get to the mountains. Lots if things to do. Fishing. Hiking hunting.  Many places are dog friendly. Yes sometimes you'll see strange stuff. Of and 4x4. Lots if forest service roads to take the new off your 4x4</text>

(Translated by Google) I passed the Sierra Nevada in the summer of 2019, highway CA-108, leaving Bridgeport towards San Francisco.

The road has a long ascent and the landscape is gradually covered by snow, until it reaches its highest point, where there is a lot of snow, even with the temperature in the range of 22 degrees Celsius. Luckily, the trip was in the afternoon and the trail was not covered, which would force us to return. Having overcome the apprehension, we were able to contemplate the beauty of the CA-108 highway and the Sierra Nevada landscapes!

The route is closed during the winter and, even at other times of the year, it is recommended to check if it is open to travel, especially if it is cold, because, as the name says, the mountain is always snowy!

(Original)
Passei pela Sierra Nevada no verão de 2019, rodovia CA-108, saindo de Bridgeport em direção a San Francisco.

A estrada tem longa ascensão e a paisagem é gradativamente tomada por neve, até atingir o seu ponto mais alto, onde há muita neve, mesmo com a temperatura na faixa de 22 graus Celsius. Por sorte, a viagem era de tarde e a pista não foi encoberta, o que nos obrigaria a retornar. Superada a apreensão, pudemos contemplar a beleza que é a rodovia CA-108 e as paisagens de Sierra Nevada!

A rota é fechada durante o inverno e, mesmo em outras épocas do ano, recomenda-se verificar se está aberta para trafegar, sobretudo se estiver frio, pois, como o próprio nome diz, a serra está sempre nevada!<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The great mountain range of the West, a barrier of forests and high peaks between the California Sea and Death Valley and the severe Nevada desert.
In the Sierra are beautiful parks, such as Sequoia and Yosemite, as well as fascinating lakes, some at its base such as the mysterious Mono Lake. It is a beautiful but huge area, which offers many Trail opportunities of all levels. Plan your visit to this area in time and carefully to make sure you enjoy it to the full according to your tastes.
