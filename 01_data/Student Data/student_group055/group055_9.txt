I think the chef changed. Their sushi was really good and fresh and good size. Until recent 2 weeks. Sushi changed significantly in size and quality. For some reason Tuna roll today is white fish, doesn't really look like tuna. I will put preview roll picture for comparison. Please take care of your quality.</Text>

We placed are order through Grubhub but their system glitched and our order got cancelled an hour and a half later. I called and asked what happened. I was told they got overwhelmed with orders after the glitch and needed to cancel and they were about to close. BUT Claudia was kind enough to take our order AND drive it to us herself. On top of it all the food was delicious. Thank you so much Claudia. Merry Christmas to you!</text>

Food is decent. Management, Keep in mind, your little hole in the wall sushi shop would be nothing without food delivery services. Show some respect and appreciation.</text>

Food might be good but I'll never know. I do food delivery and I love trying new food in new places. Atlas I'm disappointed that this place sees us drivers as something less than. I was trying to read the specials menu but was asked to go outside to wait almost immediately. It was a little crowded for CoVid so I understood. But when I re-entered after a few of the people stepped out and 10 min later. I asked about the order and tried again to look at the menu. This time I was asked to take a picture and step out. I was planning on supporting this business and ordering dinner but I guess they're to good to serve someone like me. So no 🍣 for me. Kinda disappointed. Hoping it wasn't a racial issue.< /text>

Love love loveeeee eating at Tuna Sushi. I’m pretty sure the employees recognize me because I eat here at least three times a week. It is so inexpensive and the food is great every single time I eat here. I’ll always continue to come back to eat here even if I don’t live in the area. I love how they have the rewards plan so sometimes I’ll get a free fried rice or free edamame. Overall I just love eating at Tuna Sushi and I’ll drive who knows how long to eat food here three times a week. Additionally, I always introduce my friends to this place because I love it. I would definitely recommend eating here because I’m never disappointed.<//Text>

I waited longer than an hour for my food. It was a decent sized order but when I called they said it would only take about 30 mins, after never receiving a call back, when they said they would call me, I went in and after over an hour of waiting it took forever to receive my order. I will never go here again.</Text>

< Review>
The place had a friendly atmosphere to it even though the restaurant itself was on the smaller side. I had the chicken teriyaki for 7.50 and a total of 8.02 with tax included. It was a pretty decent portion for the prise if im completly honest. The chicken was more on the crispy side because it was a lil burnt but i feel like it was still pretty decent. Unfortunately i ddnt get to try the sushi unfortunately but mayb next time.</Review>

For that case, when I arrived they were closed and I could not get my pickup order.  That was a pretty bad experience, plus they had just closed for lunch, and it was going to probably be the full hour before they were open again.

So for my update, my wife and I had some extra time, so we came here for dinner.  The service was pretty fast, and the sushi was excellent.  Glad we came back.<//review><Resp>None</Resp>< UserId.>

I read the reviews prior to going and here's my thought. Relaxing and enjoyable. I ordered a cucumber seaweed salad that was extremely refreshing. I also ordered nigiri  Tuna, Salmon, Ono, Albacore and Halibut. All very fresh, very clean. The sweet green tea is also refreshing. I look forward to returning.

<text>After losing our bookkeeper of 45 years. It was really a difficult decision to except and trust another with. We were connected with Karen and are very happy to say she’ll be our new bookkeeper and tax preparer.

Bolton Bookkeeping is absolutely the best tax service in all of Bakersfield and probably Kern County, KC has been doing our taxes for 16 years and she is trustworthy and absolutely the most fantastic person I’ve ever met in my life.< /review>

KC is the best in the business! She corrected mistakes by a previous tax preparer who shall remain nameless. She is patient, polite, and very knowledgeable. She will answer every question you have and she will educate you. She makes tax filing enjoyable. I will never go anywhere else. She is just a great person all around.<//text>

Before going to Bolton Bookkeeping I would get my taxes done at the strip-mall preparers and ended up needing legal help later because of their inexperience.
Having our own bookkeeper is a step up in life. Our returns are larger now, as well.< /text>< Pictures>

I have been using this company for over 20 years. KC has always taken care of me with my taxes. I have never had any trouble with the IRS and she has always been able to do more than just taxes. She helps me through out the year with keeping me on track for the best results for the year. I would highly recommend Bolton Tax Service.< /review>

Something I paid way too much to have to then suffer the consequences.  KC has been very thorough,  amazingly graceful in helping me and charges less then half the cost.  That's amazing!!!< /text>

KC Bolton Potter at Bolton Bookkeeping & Tax Services helped me with my taxes for two years now and always does a good job! Never done my taxes before and she helped me and had me in and out. I would highly recommend her to anyone in need for a Tax Attorney! I always get a great Tax Return!!< /Text>

<review>I've been using cricket for 3 years.  Never had a problem. Customer service is great. It's funny they are under att,  and att sucks in everyway.  This cricket store on international blvd is my favorite. All thr seniorita there is very nice.  Sorry but i would give it a five star if i could find a parking spot. not their fault but finding parking there sucks.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I have to say Valerie was amazing with my furbaby. However her staff isn't.  One of the techs came out to my car during Covid to give my furbaby a vaccine,  she didn't approach him very kind at ALL  she just jabbed him in the shoulder bone with the needle and made him yelp with no apology or compassion. I will never take my furbaby back there. It starts with the service outside of the Dr. They need to be retrained and have a compassionate heart to be in this kind of business or don't be in it. My furbaby is treated as my baby boy not a dog.😪</text>

The staff was kind, compassionate and helpful. Dr. Caruso went above and beyond her duty. She was helpful and explained everything thoroughly. I can't say enough great things about this office.

I don’t have words to describe how good that place is. Being adopted by cats for almost 17 years I have met many
Veterinary doctors, but Dr. Caruso is absolutely the best, not only as a doctor, but also as a person. Everybody in this place is very professional and very nice.  Both doctors are exceptional.
Thank you< /Review>

<Text>We have been taking our dog to Companions for approximately 3 years now and in that time they have dealt with several issues that were age related.  Because of their knowledge and compassion, our dog lived longer and better than what we thought was possible given the medical conditions she had.  Dr. Duffy was our dogs normal vet-she is professional yet really loves animals... she made appointments easier on our dog than any other vet that she had in her 15 years of life.

In the last few weeks, it became clear that our dogs quality of life was suffering.  We made the difficult decision to have her put to sleep. The appointment went as smooth as it possibly could have. We saw Dr. Caruso on a few occasions over the years and she is the one that ended up putting our dog to sleep.  It was a relief to have a vet who didn't care how many biscuits our dog ate while she was shaving her arm and administering the medicine...as long as our dog was comfortable and stress free, that was all that mattered.  Our dog, who was very food driven up to her last day, went to sleep with biscuits in her mouth.

We couldn't recommend Companions any more highly.  The staff have been helpful over the years-making sure medications could be filled at the drop of a hat and appointments were scheduled quickly and conveniently.  Both Drs. Duffy and Caruso have great bedside manner, on top of wisdom as to the best route to take with strange health problems of an animal that can't communicate what they are feeling.  We can't thank them enough for the care they provided for our dog, especially in the hardest years of her life!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809cd4c75291ee31:0x93a7cb3d6f9ff034</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<time>1562597110202< /time><rate>2</rate><Review>The staff was very friendly. Setting the apt was great. Arriving was fine, when we went back to the exam room we were speaking with the Vet when a woman came in (I assumed to ask a question or something the way she came in the room) but then she sat down and ripped my puppy out from under my chair, without warning or introduction. She then proceeded to tell me my 2.5 month old puppy was nervous amd needed to get use to her. This all happen in under 2 min. I stood up and said "And who are you?" Oh, she was the MANAGER?!?!?! Becca.
She stood and tried to give my dog easy cheese without asking to get him to like her. I had to ask her not to give my dog people food.
She should have been the one to ask if she could give him people food. She should have offered her scent to the pup before grabbing at him from under his people. She should have introduced herself to the owners before approaching their animal. As the manager she should have known better.
It was at this point in the apt. that my family walked out with our pup. The rest of the staff was wonderful. The manager might be better suited for a different kind of work. Im surprused she made it to management.
I would NEVER recommend this clinic while Becca not only works there but is in charge setting the example.< /Review>< pictures>

When I went in they checked her out by just taking her temperature and then looked at her and said she needs a emergency procedure and said they're assuming because of the way she looks she has FIV. They did not barely touch her and assumed that she needed surgery and that we needed to hand over $5,000 For the procedure. Scared and not having that much money right away we try to find something we can do. And we look more into and we go to another vet and they say "she doesn't need any procedure she is just constipated and backed up and to rub a warm washcloth on her belly and give her some medicine so she'll be fine. And now she is perfectly healthy and these people just wanted us to give them $5,000 for something she didn't even have and something they were assuming she had they didn't even test her for and I will never bring her back here again and suggest no one comes here. Also she was a kitten and that procedure is to much for a kitten to handle for no reason.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I went here to get my cat her shots, the vet was an absolute nightmare , She literally told me and my 6 year old daughter that if my cat were to get pregnant that "ALL OF MY KITTENS WOULD DIE!"   Needless to say i will not be going back here and i would rather drive to Oroville to get treatment for my pets</Text>

<text>Took my dog to have teeth cleaned.  When I picked him up they handed him to us and said he was still groggy from the anesthetic... which I wondered about because they had told me earlier he would have to be walking before they would release him.  Got him home and every time he tried to walk his back legs would collapse.  When he was still having difficulty after the weekend, I called them.  They had me come in and looked at him and said it had nothing to do with his procedure ... it was probably his cruciate tendon.  They charged me $60 for the visit and some anti inflammatory meds.  My dog still has a terrible limp.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809cd4c75291ee31:0x93a7cb3d6f9ff034</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Arrived an half hour before the dealership(parts department)was to close at 07:00pm just as the web site states. I was told from an employee of Inland Kenworth Long Beach,CA that they close at 06:30pm. It wasn't only myself, but two other customers that were in need of parts. All parts employees were out of the store at 06:31pm I think they were ready to leave at 06:00pm. That's why I was perfer to go to Velocity,Rush,TEC & FleetPride where customers comes first. You can have signs and say you're all about customers service, but actually has to be carried out by the employees. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
My exhaust gas pressure sensor, Part# 4928594 - easily available for  $19 to $25 dollars online,  was $106 here.   The solitary light bulb they installed for my turn signal was .61 cents.     Add them together here and you'll walk away with a bill that's over $700.

Now, with over 1 million single-owner miles on the T660 that I brought here, it should go without saying that I understand diesel repairs can be expensive.  I'm not even a stranger to Inland and have spoken highly of the company in the past, especially at their Phoenix location.  But this location (Carson - first time here) is really something to take away my breath.

How does a mechanic turn less than $30  dollars worth of parts - the most complex of which installs as easily as a spark plug, into a bill that's over $700 dollars high?

What if we even use an Inland number like $106 for parts?  That still leaves us $600 off total.

It wasn't diagnosis.  That happened quickly.   And this repair was easy.  (See pic)

Drivers, you should expect this kind of billing if you go here.  As other truck owners have noted, Carson's bills are "different."  Your potentially positive experience with Inland elsewhere is irrelevant.< /Review>

I went to this dealership for repairs on my W900L and I have to say that I am very pleased with the way they received me and took care of my truck. They were already fully booked for repairs when I got there. The next day the service manager left his office to take care of my truck .
They are very professional .<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) The service is the worst, you are waiting for a long time to attend you, it seems that the sales in that place were by phone, the sellers pass on the phone for a long time without importing what they are waiting for, I do not recommend buying in this place

Aaron is great to work with! He and his staff have always responded quickly to my questions and concerns. When I’ve had life changes (new car, new house, husband passing away, elderly mom moving in, etc) he’s been great about getting all he needs to know about the situation and presents me with insurance options that best meets my needs, and with great rates! He was also able to help a friend after her homeowners policy was recently canceled.  I highly recommend this agency – I’ve been with them for many years and have been very happy with their service!<//text>

I don’t even know where to start with how helpful Bridgett has been with any of my cars over the past years.

Lemme just keep it short and sweet. Absolutely on point and so attentive without any hesitation & with the greatest attitude.

She earned a life long customer.< /Review>

Aaron Sessions and his team have been servicing our insurance policies for 5+ years. Every interaction, regardless of who answers the phone or responds to emails, has been handled professionally, promptly and with personalized attention. I appreciate that we’re not simply an account number when calling an 800#. The regular review of our policies gives us peace of mind that we have the right amount of coverage. In the end, it’s all about protecting what’s most important. Aaron’s team helps us do just that.<//Text>

I have been with State Farm, this particular office in Campbell, for 30 years. They are nothing short of amazing. Everyone is top notch!! If I ever had a claim, they were on it with lightning speed. And super helpful! No waiting on hold or waiting for a return call. I HIGHLY suggest that you switch your current insurance to this office. Or if you're looking for insurance, look no further. A huge shout-out to Beth in this office for all her incredible work.<//text>

I wish everyone would conduct business the way Bridget and Aaron Sessions have for me. They've been my insurance company for over 11 years now and have made every contact pleasant and simple. They've helped me through homeowners insurance, multiple automobile policies and personal liability insurance. Bridget has been more than accommodating, has promptly answered all of my questions (there have been a lot) and gotten back to me with lightning speed anytime I've ever needed anything.
Aaron has gone out of his way multiple times to explain in layman's terms what I should have in terms of coverage and why. I really can't say enough about how great this particular office is. I'm lucky to have been introduced to them years ago.<//Text>

The team at Aaron Sessions are fantastic!! I have been working out of state for the last 11 months and every time I have needed them they are right there. I have been a Statefarm customer for more years then I can remember. When my previous agent Gary retired I found my self on Aaron’s doorstep and I couldn’t be happier.

Thanks for everything!!!</Review>

I've been with State Farm for over 10 years. When we moved to Campbell, I switched my agent over to Aaron Sessions and his team (Bridget, Beth, Krista, ...). They are all extremely knowledgeable, professional and proactive -- always reaching out over the phone for annual payment reminders, suggestions for lower rates and so on. If they need a moment to double check policies on RV rentals, they will do so and get back to me right away.

On the couple of occasions where we've needed to make claims, they are always easy to get to, working with claim adjusters and repair shops to get us what we need promptly.

I highly recommend these folks for their thorough commitment, integrity and overall awesomeness!<//Review>

I have been with State Farm a long time and have had several other agents before Aaron Sessions and I’ve always been happy with the service. Aaron took over when my previous agent left and I can say without a doubt him and his team take care of me just as well as the previous if not better.</Text>

I switched to State Farm over 5 years ago because of a bad experience with Progressive. I was looking for an insurance company that was "old school". I wanted a direct contact and someone I can actually talk or email quickly if I had questions or issues. Aaron Sessions office is exactly what I wanted! They answer my questions quickly and if they do not have an answer they look into it.

Aaron, Krista and the entire office work as a well oiled machine. I trust them and what I like the most is that they are honest. I am so happy I switched and if friends ask I definitely tell them about Aaron Sessions and team!</text>

I have been working with Beth at Aaron Sessions' office for almost 15 years. After my husband passed away in 2007 and I still had three school-age children at home, Beth partnered with me to make important financial decisions that I was not comfortable making alone. She is always looking for ways for me to save money and at the same time, take into account that my situation is continuously evolving. I am very grateful for their professional guidance.< /text>

<review>I've been with Aaron Sessions over the past 9 years.  Aaron and his crew, including Bridget, have always been the best.  They respond quickly with my concerns.  They seem to always be available.  They are always looking for ways to save me money.  They don't try to oversell anything, only what you need.  I have many different types of policies with Aaron and feel comfortable that his team is watching over my best interests.</review>< rating>

<Text>I really do feel like I have friends at Aaron Sessions' State Farm. I've been with this group for probably over 10 years and I've always been treated with great customer service.
It first started with Beth, or Beth from State Farm as I call her, she's great.
Recently, several times, I've had the pleasure of working with Bridget, who I now will call Bridget From State Farm. ;)

Here's the latest example of why I continue to work with my friends at State Farm. On Tuesday my company realized that one of our work vans had been vandalized, so I called my State Farm office and Bridget answered the phone, I told her the story and she immediately go me connected to the claims department to open my claim, which was also very simple and convenient. They referred me to a local repair shop and within a couple hours our van was picked up and towed to the repair shop. Less than two days later, yesterday, we received an estimate with bad news that the part they needed was on back order and would take two to three months to arrive, what!!!

This not being acceptable I immediately called state farm and guess who answered, Bridget. I told her what the repair shop had said and that it wasn't acceptable to our business which needs the van, she understood and called the repair shop. A few minutes later she called me back and told me the shop is now prioritizing our repair. later in the day, again yesterday, she called back to tell me that the shop located the part in Fremont and would pick it up before the end of day.

Here's the amazing part. I just got a call from the shop saying the van would be ready at 2pm today! Is Bridget the best or what?!?!?!

Call State Farm today and ask for Bridget, if she doesn't answer.<//Text>< UserId.>

I switched over to Aaron Sessions' office about a year and a half ago after having an awful experience with my previous agent and I'm so glad I found them! Aaron was great in our initial meeting and took the time to go through my policies and explain things clearly to me without being "salesy". He has a very trustworthy, easy but caring demeanor about him which was so different from the agent I had before. Bridget is also fabulous and is my go to for when I need to get things done quickly. Based on my experience, the owner of the agency dictates the culture of the office and sets the expectations and standards for their employees and it's evident that this office places a high value on professionalism and maintaining trust with their customers. I definitely feel like I'm being taken care of and with that comes peace of mind.< /review>< username>

When my car was hit on the freeway, State Farm quickly approved a rental car and started working on the damage estimate.  The car was correctly deemed totaled and I received an adequate check to replace my car.  Very happy with the quick process and dealing with compassionate staff.< /review>

<review>Our family has had insurance with State Farm only and the same agent up until a few years ago.  When John retired we were shuffled around to different agents, not feeling like a valued client after 50 plus years, until now.  We transferred our policies to Aaron Sessions office after reading  good reviews.  We had a lot of changes to make after a death in the family and Bridget handled everything for us.  I had lots of questions and the Head Office made some errors, however Bridget made sure it was all taken care of.   All was done through email and she is always, polite, pleasant, responsive and more than efficient.  You can tell she takes pride in taking care of the client.  While I hope to never need to place a claim,  I feel confident in knowing that we will be taken care of  and Bridget is a huge asset to this office.</review>< Resp>

<text>I got a text message from Krista in Aaron Sessions office asking me to send my odometer reading for the car so that she can adjust the miles that we are supposed to drive according to policy and save money. I did send the readings and saved a significant amount because -- Covid and retirement made both my wife and I stay home for past 10 months except going out for shopping. I appreciate how quickly and responsively they helped me and saved money! Any time I talk with Aaron, I found him to helpful, cordial and I do really believe that he is being a good neighbor! Thanks Aaron and Krista!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I am very pleased with my experience meeting with Aaron.  I have future plans for remodeling and wanted to find out how/what should be changed with my current policy.

Aaron took his time explaining my options so I knew exactly what he was talking about and I could make the right decisions that were best for me.

I was also interested in fire and earthquake insurance. He did an excellent job explaining why they should be considered as important added policies.

It was a good experience and I was very grateful for the time and details he took to help.<//review>

This has been hands down the best insurance agent and staff that I’ve ever had thus far. They have went above and beyond to accommodate me in a few instances. One person in particular, Bridget, has done many things to assist me even when it wasn’t necessarily in the scope of her job. If you live in the San Jose or Santa Cruz areas, do yourself a favor and go see these folks, they will get you sorted out and won’t treat you like “just another customer”.< /text>

Aaron Sessions has been my agent since he started with State Farm. My experience with Aaron and his fantastic team has always been professional and accurate. They have always been extremely helpful and resourceful with all my questions and concerns. The knowledge, understanding, and commitment they provide, made me truly understand the importance of insurance, especially life insurance. If you are looking for an agency that will greet you with open arms, bend over backward to deliver on their promise, help you navigate through life challenges, and set you up for retirement success, you need to give Aaron and his team a call. Trust me, I would not have been with them for all these years if I did not believe in them or trust them 100%. I can't say I have always agreed with State Farm, but I can tell you I have always appreciated the openness and candor Aaron and his team provides. Thanks for all that you have done and will continue to do for me and my family.< /Text>

Aaron is great! He goes above and beyond to make sure you are getting the right product you need. He really takes time to listen to your needs, and goes over everything to make sure you understand what you are getting. I really appreciated how he went over my current home and auto insurance, and explained in detail what everything means and made recommendations even when I didn't even have these policies with him. Highly recommend him!<//text>

I like to give Bridget Barbieri at Statefarm Ins. In Campbell,Ca. A special thank you and complement her on her quick and thorough response to my recent request in changing some of my auto policy coverage.
Thanks to her! I feel I made the correct decision in signing up with Bridge@Statefarm Ins.
I honestly recommend this company.👍🏿
Thanks again!

We’ve been working with State Farm and Aaron’s Sessions team for almost 10 years.  Specifically and recently, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Beth Young who helped us through placing various new insurance policies as well as reviewing existing policies to make sure we are adequately covered at the best value possible. Beth was patient, knowledgeable, and responsive in every step of the way.  She also suggested or informed us about certain factors to consider when placing a policy that we would have otherwise not known about.  It’s always stress free working with this team (even when I unfortunately had to call for a minor fender bender!)  We would highly recommend Beth and this entire team for those who are looking for knowledgeable professionals , reputable company, and most of all dedicated client service.<//review>

<Review>I got started with Aaron Sessions as my account got bounced from one agent to another a while back. I had some issues with insurance in general so I made an appointment with Aaron and we sat down and went through the whole thing, personal and for my business. Immediately it was clear that Aaron was exceptional. He was not only thorough and competent, he readily “went to bat” for me on a disputed item, and put a lot of good new thought and perspective into my business insurance needs as well. For the first time in my life I feel like I understand my business and personal coverage, and have confidence in it. Aaron’s team is always very responsive, updates me on Important items, and follows up on my requests or concerns. This is how insurance should be handled.<//Review><Time>1602270959165< /Time><gmap_id>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7<//gmap_id>< pics>

State farm transfered to me Aaron and his team when my old agent retired. They are wonderful! Very responsive and professional. They know their stuff too! If I have any questions and they don't know the answers they will get right on it and get me an answer right away. I met with them recently and they were quick to help me find ways to save money on my premium. I highly recommend them!<//Review>

<Review>I recently moved and was in need of Renters Insurance. I reached out to this agency because I have other friends who hold policies with them and had nothing but amazing things to say. I spoke to Aaron at first and he transferred me to Bridget. I just can't say enough about BRIDGET! She was super responsive, very friendly and answered all of my questions (and even asked me some I didn't think to ask) She followed up with me after setting up my policy to make sure I was all set. Definitely recommend using this agency for your insurance needs! ;)<//Review>< userid>

I had moved to South Bay following years of State Farm great support in both MI and TX.  Arron and his fab team including a very wise advisor, Golden Retriever, did not disappoint. Lots of transitions moving into a new area, these guys made the insurance one nice and easy.  Cally driving, not so easy , had a auto accident at worst time possible , Krista took over. Helped with rental car to claims...great group!< /text>

<text>As a company leader my time is limited and I rely on experts in their fields to do what they do best. Beth Young and her team at Aaron's office are absolute experts that I've come to trust and rely on for all things insurance, even when our needs are is outside of State Farm's service area. Beth's helped us with all of our insurance needs to open three challenging new offices in less than six months. Not to mention the four established offices and multiple corporate vehicles that she continuously makes sure we're up to date with.

I know that if I need anything she's there to help. Not only does she look out for our "current" needs, she anticipates situations that helps me do my job better (and look good in front of my superiors).

Beth, You're the absolute best, hands down, and I can't thank you enough for everything you do.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Aaron Sessions State Farm has always been helpful with me and my family for several years.  When my children were learning how to drive Aaron Sessons helped me with the best coverage for both my house and the cars and went though the possible liability should they get into an accident.  I would highly recommend them for your insurance needs<//Text>

Aaron has been my State Farm agent for years and have been very happy since switching over from another insurance company.  What I appreciate most about him and his staff is how friendly they are and their willingness to help as quickly as possible.  Whatever it is that you need they are on top of it.  They really go above and beyond to take care of their clients and although there are cheaper options in the market, Aaron and his staff really represent State Farm well and go above and beyond with their excellent customer care.  They deliver great peace of mind and the value they deliver isn't appreciated until you're in a pinch and really need help right away, in which case I know that this office will come though; I know because I had to actually needed their help :)  The biggest thing is that when you do need help, it's Aaron and his staff that help you, not an 800 number line.  When you call, it's the actual staff that works at his office and Aaron himself.  Please be my agent forever, you and your staff are really great!< /Text>

I have been completely satisfied with Aaron Sessions and his entire staff since choosing him for all of my insurance needs nine years ago.  I am always treated with respect and receive timely responses to my calls and emails alike.  The staff spends whatever amount of  time is needed to answer my questions and to address any / all concerns I have.

Krista Stouffer has become a great asset since joining Aaron's team. She is always (yes, always!) pleasant and professional.  She is quick to help and makes sure that I'm satisfied before wrapping up whatever we've worked on together. I appreciate her thoroughness and "it's no trouble at all" attitude.

I continue to recommend Aaron to my friends and family.< /review>

Aaron and Bridget are amazing to work with getting back to me immediately with suggestions and answers. I was using another insurance company for 40 years (with no personal contact) so it goes without saying that State Farm is  the only company that I will work with. The referrals I have given them have been extremely happy as well.
Grateful to have found them.< /review>

<Text>I’ve been with Aaron and his crew for over a decade. I moved out of the South Bay Years ago and into the Central Valley, but they’re so nice and easy to work with that I’ve stayed with them anyway. They are pleasant, professional, and always make it easy for me to manage my insurance needs whenever life changes. As far as pricing goes, I know I’m getting a good deal too. I sometimes get quotes from other companies (when the budget gets tight), but over the years I have never gotten a better rate than State Farm. So that makes it easy to stay too.

Thanks Aaron and MANY thanks to your reps for always taking care of me.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><Date>1590087326697<//Date>< pictures>

The team at the Aaron Sessions office is awesome! In the 12+ years I've held insurance with State Farm I've had the pleasure of working with this office. They are always friendly and go above and beyond. Most importantly their response time is phenomenal. I never have to wait for help. In fact, one time I called about rental car insurance while I was checking out at the airport and the team answered my call within minutes and got me what I needed. I'll never switch insurance companies because nothing can compare to the service I get.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I've been insured with Aaron Sessions (State Farm) for so many years now that I have lost count of how long it has actually been. His hand picked team is truly the best group of insurance agents you will find. They are professional, polite and genuinely want to do whats best for you. I never feel like there is any pressure to purchase anything that I am not comfortable with. While other agencies seem pushy and only want commission from your purchase, the atmosphere in Aaron's office the exact opposite of that.

Before I was with Aaron Sessions, I never really understood the insurance policies that I had. I just knew it was against the law to drive around without insurance so I bought whatever the agent said I should have and that was that. It wasn't until Aaron explained and broke it all down that I finally understood what I was paying for and why it was necessary. Aaron's team is not only dedicated to selling you good/quality insurance but they are also dedicated to making sure that you understand exactly what you are paying for. They go above and beyond to make sure everything you buy suits your actual needs. After all, why would you pay for Hurricane insurance if you live in California?! Or why would you buy boat insurance if you don't own a boat?!

Beth Young personally handles all of my accounts with care. She follows up with me each year to make sure my policies are still relevant to my current needs. We do an annual touch base just in case there are any changes to my family. She is always happy to give me a quote for anything I may need and responds to my requests within a reasonable time (usually within 24hrs).

There's no better agency to go to if you are looking for insurance of any kind. I highly recommend Aaron Sessions.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<text>I was unlucky enough to have a deer damage my vehicle during evacuation with my family from the recent Santa Cruz wildfires.

As we have bundled home and auto insurance with State Farm I elected to get my vehicle repaired and  only wanted the best bodyshop to do the work. Once the shop inspected the damage I lodged a claim easily using the StateFarm phone app in around 10 minutes.

The initial claim was approved the same day so I could get the vehicle repairs started. When more damage was detected by the repairer additional claims were approved and paid without delay.

A member of Aarons team also reached out to me during evacuation to check our status and was able to confirm all our coverage was up to date and adequate in case we faced a real risk of total loss of home and other vehicles. Luckily our home was spared.

To have an insurance company provide such prompt processing, approval and payment during such a stressful time was an incredible asset to lowering our stress levels and gave tremendous peace of mind.</text>< pics>

I have had vehicle insurance through Aaron Sessions’ office for about 18 years now and would never think of going anywhere else. No matter who I talk to, I am always well taken care of with professionalism, kindness, patience and sincerity. Aaron, Krista and Bridget are awesome—they have helped me most recently with some changes, and I always appreciate their fast responses along with kept promises. When I am told something will happen, they are always true to their word. Last, I never have to worry about losing unnecessary money, as they are ever vigilant in having my back. Thank you so much guys!< /Review>

As a mortgage broker since 1997, I have have worked with many insurance agents in the process of securing mortgages for my clients.  I have never though worked with one more on top of their business than Aaron.  His professionalism, knowledge and forward thinking approach to his business and customer service are 2nd to none and why I send my clients to him.  I know they will be taken care of the same way I do and that means a lot to me to encompass the entire home buying experience.  If you need insurance services, I can't recommend Aaron and his team enough!< /Text>

"LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, STATE FARM IS THERE" At Aaron Session's office, it's not only a jingle but a fact! The best part is, We have our very own personal  "Jake" but her name is "BETH"! and yes, I've had to call her at "3 in the morning" but never have asked what she's wearing!

In October of 2019 my car window was smashed in and broken into. This happened just hours before boarding a flight out of the country for two weeks! Beth and the Sessions team was there to help me file a claim, repair my car, detail my car, received compensation for the items stolen, car rental, etc. and during this whole ordeal, Beth was hand holding this thing all the way to completion!

The level of care, service, professionalism, follow through and efficiency will not be found elsewhere. It really should be,

<Review>Bridget is always very friendly and helpful. I needed some information for my current insurance and my Home/Car insurances in Colorado thru State Farm. Immediately after my request, I received a call from the SF agent here. And I am planning to go with State Farm for my cars and home, old and new, here in Colorado.

In the past, whenever I needed help for me or my daughter, Bridget was very helpful.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Aaron and his team have been incredibly helpful to me and my husband over the years. Whenever anything unexpected comes along, it's of immense comfort to know that I can turn to them to help guide me through it. A tree once fell on my truck, not something one can plan for. Still, Beth Young was there to immediately help me file a claim, get the damage repaired, and even knew the best body shop in town. It's a comfort to know that when something beyond your control comes along, they're there to help you deal with it.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>After recently finding it necessary to add Renters Insurance to my policy, State Farm has been incredibly helpful each step of the way. While this is my first time buying Renters Insurance, I feel well informed and prepared. From the beginning, I was redirected to my agent, Aaron Sessions, and his wonderful team, including Bridget, who has personally walked me through each step of the process. Bridget has delivered clear and thorough information to me and has responded very quickly to each of my requests. Not to mention, immediately making sure all discounts applicable were activated on my policy. Thanks to the team at State Farm, I feel like I can always count on the support I may need when it comes to my policy.<//Text>< user_name>

A+ service from Aaron Sessions State Farm everytime! Sal is always so patient with the questions I have and is always willing to provide me with information. I can't recommend this office enough to anyone looking for insurance. The service you receive here is superior to cheaper agencies like Geico and Progressive. Reach out to them and ask for Sal, you will not regret it.< /Review>

<user>102978939579598465692< /user><text>I just retired and have been like most others at home for safety reasons. I was treated very well when renewing my policy. I was asked the right questions about car use, sheltering-in-place and other factors, like mileage that  might change the status of my policy.  Payment was collected a later to help economically. I could not have asked for more.
Thank you for the VP treatment during this pandemic!< /text>< date>

Aaron Sessions is the best insurance agent I have ever had.  He is smart and pro-active, and he does a thorough review with you  of all your policies and how they work together to optimize your coverage and to minimize your expenses.  Also the office is very responsive and professional.</Review>

Recently worked with Sal in this office to move all of our insurance plans over to State Farm.  He took us through the quoting process and explained everything thoroughly and answered all of our questions and we had a ALOT.  Everything was handled with the utmost professionalism AND best of all we actually ended up saving money on our policies.  I am really happy we made the switch from our old insurance company and have found a new office that gives us such great customer service.< /review>

I use to be with Liberty Insurance but when I moved to Rinconada Hills in Los Gatos, Liberty refused to insure my new home claiming it was fire-prone.

My mortgage broker recommended Aaron Sessions State Farm for insurance.  They gave me a fair quote for Home and Auto Insurance and made sure I got all the discounts.

After closing, Aaron and his support staff of Krista and Beth have been very helpful.  Aaron also invited is into his office to review the coverage in detail.  He also offered to review our long term care insurance.

When he did he explained what I had bought 10 years ago in plain English and made it very understandable. Plus he didn't try to sell us anything.

Aaron and his team have provided the best insurance support I have ever had.

Highly Recommended!<//review>

I highly recommend Aaron Sessions - State Farm Insurance. His Customer Service Representatives are exceptional. They are knowledgable and very courteous. Aaron and his CSR - Krista have always been very kind in answering all of my questions and very efficient in filling all of my insurance needs. If you have questions about insurance, you should call someone you can trust with your insurance needs - Call Aaron Sessions.<//Text>

Aaron and his team have been great, always available to answer questions, and look at ways to save me money. I have been a member with State Farm since 1988 and can't imagine working with anyone else.

Thank you Aaron and Team!<//text>

I have been working with State Farm Campbell on getting a Car and Renters insurance (after considering other companies of course). I appreciate the great service and high coverage options.
Beth Young does an excellent Job getting you the right deals and was always very fast to respond to my E-Mails (which is my preferred way to communicate). There is also the option to go to the office where you will experience the same great service.<//Text>

In all my years as a consumer end-user as well as a self-employed person, I've very rarely experienced on a grand-scale, consistent basis, such exceptional treatment as a client then I have from this most excellent, top-of-the-line insurance provider!

Seriously, if you're looking for an insurance provider and a place to call home when it comes to all of your insurance needs, don't concern yourself in spending even one more second in going beyond this gem of a "got it all together" insurance office.

Not at all to sound corny, but, seriously, "like a good neighbor, Aaron Sessions and State Farm are there for you!" Mark my words, once you become their client, you'll never look back.

I cannot tell you how many individuals that I've personally recommended to this office. In fact, there have been times when I've actually conferenced a call between friends and Aaron's office to introduce said friends to this first class outfit.

It's a wonderful feeling to never have even one iota of a doubt that the friends and associates that mean much to me will consistently and invariably receive "second-to-none" customer service - integrity abounds from whichever team member answers the phone because Aaron has, literally, the very best and most genuine and most professional individuals working in his office.

By the way, if you happen to have Bridget answer the phone when you call this office, oh my, you will be speaking with, and mark my words on this, one of THE most professional, knowledgeable and pleasant individuals you'll ever encounter from any business, period, end of story! Aaron really scored big time when he hired her Bridget!

She is an absolute gem and what a tremendous blessing and true asset to Aaron - he should be ever so thankful that Bridget is on his team and part of his business.

In addition, having personally met Aaron on numerous occasions at his office over the many years that I've been a client and knowing and experiencing his integrity, I'm quite confident that he often reflects on what a blessing he has in his midst like of the likes of Bridget.

What is so amazing too, as mentioned in the beginning of my review here, that when you call Aaron's office, any individual who answers the phone will immediately win your confidence, the staff working there "really are" THAT good! So, you can imagine if you happen to get Bridget on the other line as your representative that you're in for a real treat!

Well, that's my full report!

Quick FYI: Let me be super clear that I have no relatives or connections to anyone working at Aaron's office and no one has coerced me to write this review.

Consider this review and this highest of recommendations a true joy for me to write because it has been a true joy to write.

By recommending Aaron Sessions and his first-class team, I know that I know that I know that I've helped someone along the way (and hopefully many along the way) who desire to look no further for the very best insurance office for all of their insurance needs!</text>

I have known Aaron Sessions for over 8 years. He is a great person and great agent. I have had and still have several insurance policies with him covering both business and home liability for many years. His team is always friendly and courteous. Whenever I need to provide proof of insurance, Aaron and his team take care of my request while I am on the phone. I don’t often encounter this high level of service. I give Aaron and his team my highest recommendation.< /text>

I have been purchasing my insurance from Aaron Session's office for the last 4 years. I feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to work with Bridget during this time. She offered me the care and responsiveness that I feel should be used as the standard. Not only is she easy to talk to, she really listens to your needs and offers the best policy to fulfill those needs. She is just awesome at what she do! Thank you Bridget for all of these years!< /text>

Aaron Sessions and his staff always reply promptly without sales pressure or upselling, and even offer ideas to save money.   Haven't had a claim yet so I'm not sure how smoothly that will be handled.  It is worth checking them out when it is time for comparison shopping or adding a new policy.</Text>

State Farm is always professional, courteous, and helpful when I call... and I always get a live person on the phone. Bridget and Aaron recently assisted me in problem-solving around an issue I had with flood insurance through my HOA. They both spent time to address this with me, even though the issue ultimately had nothing to do with my State Farm homeowner's insurance... yet they still assisted! It was greatly appreciated.

I wrote the above paragraph several years ago, and I am chiming in again. After 20 years with Aaron Sessions State Farm, I have had nothing but positive experiences. Friendly customer service/timely and thoughtful e-mail replies, clear communication, and coverage that has always been reasonable and helpful in all situations. Bridget recently assisted me with transitioning and changing some of my coverage after selling my home and moving. I will now have a new State Farm agent since I moved 3,000 miles away - and I will miss Aaron Sessions. They have consistently set the bar high.< /text>

<text>If you are looking for a reliable insurance company, go with State Farm, and choose Aaron Sessions as your agent. You can thank me later!

Aaron and every member of his team is incredibly helpful. Aaron is very knowledgeable about insurance and life planning in general, and will provide you with valuable guidance on how to secure your future.

<text>They were very friendly in the office. We had Gary Wenberg for years and when he retired it got to be a mess with State Farm. I was looking for more of a family atmosphere like Gary had and I think we found it. Just had my first review on my cars, renters and life insurance. Aaron is very thorough explaining everything and the good and bad about everything.  He tries to save you money where he can. I am very satisfied in the 5 months or so I've had him. I do miss Gary though he was great<//text>< pics>

<text>We can't say enough about the hospitality and service we receive from Aaron and his team.  We've been loyal customers for many years and they have always gone above and beyond what we would expect from an insurance agency.

Our main contact is Beth, and she is a pleasure to deal with!  My wife and I always leave the office feeling secure, knowing that Aaron and the crew are there whenever we need them.

Living in San Jose, there are many other State Farm agents we could have chosen, but we gladly make the drive over to Campbell just for the outstanding service we receive here.  (Plus they offer free cold drinks while you're there)</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Aaron's been my agent since he took on the Campbell office and I couldn't be more pleased with how I have been treated. His staff is very attentive and always helpful. I no longer live in the area so I was afraid that this would mean I'd have to change agents to get good service, but that has not been the case.<//Review>

<review>We switched over to State Farm when we moved into our new home at the beginning of the year. First of all, combining our auto & home with them was WAY cheaper than other companies we looked at.

Second, Beth couldn't have been more helpful when making our decision. She answered every question clearly and was very friendly. Then, when we came in for our orientation, Aaron met with us on a Saturday afternoon and walked us through everything - even perks of our coverage we didn't know we had. He also added "i don't care if something happens at 2 in the morning - call me."

Even months into our coverage, if a simple question pops up I shoot Beth an email and I have an answer within a couple hours. Their immediate, friendly service and willingness to help puts us at ease! I'd recommend with no hesitations.<//review>< Pictures>

This State Farm office is so pleasant to deal with. They call or email when they have information to lower my insurance. They helped my high school graduate apply for a first Visa card. Communication with the staff is always easy and clear. I highly recommend this State Farm location.<//Text>

<Text>I am insured with Aaron Sessions (State Farm) for about 8 yrs now and have only positive things to share. Interacting with the friendly team is very easy and pleasant. The insurance products are easy to understand and also can be changed flexibly as your life situations change. My best experience with Aaron Sessions and State Farm insurance was a few years ago when the Loma Fire damaged my property and State Farm quickly resolved the damage to my full satisfaction. All my claims were quickly resolved and damaged to dwellings and personal property were quickly and fully paid for.  Cannot praise this insurance company higher. Would always go with State Farm after this experience. Neighbors went thru a lot of more trouble with their insurance companies.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<time>1493862153121< /time><username>Michael Brown</username><Text>Greetings friends of San Jose! My name is Michael, and I recently moved to California from the East Coast. Though my only experience for insurance has been with State Farm, my time with Aaron has certainly been my best (from 3 states over ten years).

Moving from any state comes with many challenges. One of those challenges is a long list of transfers, such as car insurance, dental, school, etc. My agent 2100 miles away knew of Aaron and recommended him wholeheartedly. Still, I felt inclined to do my due diligence and researched several agents in Silicon Valley to ensure I would be taken care of if an emergency arose, God forbid. Don't waste your time researching-- this office is good people and deserve your resources. Bridgette handled my move seamlessly and made me feel a part of the San Jose community before I even got off the plane. Not only did she communicate with the Atlanta office without me lifting a finger, but she recommended places to live, restaurants to eat, and sites to experience.

Upon my arrival, a meeting at the office (on a Saturday, nonetheless) was recommended, but I could not find the time to get into the office. I called Aaron on the phone, introduced myself, and had a small conversation. Most of you will agree that seldom do actual agents take the time to speak with you, especially about smaller ticket items or just to check in. Aaron is available at any time if you feel that you need to speak with the 'big boss'. He will be there for your family, and he will make sure you are taken care of. Even on Saturdays...

The service Aaron's team has provided me to date has been nothing but spectacular. I would recommend any insurance customer (Auto, Home, etc.) in the Bay Area to consider this team to take care of you... In times of need, Aaron, Bridgette, Sean, and the rest of the crew in Campbell will make sure you feel important, and help you survive some of the most difficult times in life. I wholeheartedly suggest you give Aaron a chance. It will be a 5-star experience.

Best,
Michael Brown< /Text><rate>5</rate>< gmap_id>

All the agents in this office have provided fast and courteous service whenever I've had a problem or question. They will personally call you if you've forgotten to make a payment rather than letting things lapse or charging you a late fee.   Definitely has the feel of a small-town office in the halcyon days when good customer service was the norm.<//text>

<Review>Time after time I get great service from Krista at Aaron Sessions. Having to change policies 3 times a month, adding/increasing coverage, and removing other things due to moving to temporarily adding a rented RV that is covered (at no additional cost - might I add) ... They deliver and the turn around time is amazing!< /Review>< response>

Just walking into this store is fun! The leather smell is wonderful. I buy metal rings from this store; they have so many options of metals, leather stamps, and leather paints/stains. And of course leather! The store space is an open floor plan so it's easy to stay 6 feet away from other customers. Everything is reasonably priced.</review>

How about updating your hours of operation online so people don’t drive to your store pointlessly?< /review>

This shop has a ton of great choices for leather. Anything from thick, heavy oz pieces to thin garment type material and the prices are reasonable. The staff were both friendly and helpful. They also have pretty much any tool you could need for finishing your project. I'll definitely come back.
The storefront faces away from the 215 freeway so enter from Cam Real or drive around the building.<//text>

I love this store.  Everything I need and want for my leather projects is there.  Great selection of tools, accessories, and leather.  The staff is friendly and willing to help if you have questions.  Otherwise you are free to explore and check stuff out.  Buy a membership if you are going to shop there frequently, it will save you money in the long run.  For birthdays and holidays ask for tandy gift cards.<//text>

The leathers that are on sale for $49.99 are huge!  I bought 3, got there at 9:20 AM and still got some really nice ones!  One of them looks like bison, but a huge piece!  Also bought the leather splitter that's on sale, great finds at great prices!  And the staff is always awesome!<//text>

Fun. funny. creative. inspiring. blah blah blah. i LOVE this place. so glad i found it because now i feel like i have a great place to release some creative energies and be somewhat social at the same time! so far i've done heavy metal aerobics (a.mazing) and a mini pie class (de.licious).  next on the list is a sewing class. can't wait!

good times. good people.<//review>

<review>Prices are outrageous. Everything was 3 to 4 times the price as buying online unless you want to drop $150.00 on an elite club membership.

Great customer service and they speak English and Spanish. Good prices. Just note if your vegetarian they use the same chile verde sauce that may contain meat so think twice before you order cheese enchiladas. Their salsa is ACTUALLY spicy so be careful. Overall great food!Worth the trip to Inyo st.< /Review>< user_id>

A local place whose business has been spread via word of mouth. I can't help but recommend this to new neighbors when they ask about Mexican food. Personally, I go for their Tortas. The place can be really easy to miss. It does get busy so parking can be a bit of an issue. I tried eating at location, but the benches seemed filthy and there was trash sitting on the table next to us. Good food nonetheless.<//text>

<name>Shannon Munoz<//name><time>1609836649873< /time><rate>5</rate><Text>Well I used to give this restaurant a 5 star review but ever since they got a new cook I had to write a new review. I need to let you know that the Chile Verde tast like it is from the can. I used to go and eat there at least 3 times a week. The wet burrito was awesome and the tacos tasted just as good. I am sorry to say the new cook does not stand a chance. I won't be returning to eat there in till they get the other cook back or find someone that can cook like him. Good luck

This is an update on this restaurant. They got the old cook back. I eat here at least 2 times a week maybe more. I call in my orders most of the time, that way you don't have to wait long. Sometimes they don't answer the phone or they put you on hold and forget about you. But the food is good and it is definitely worth the wait. I would recommend eating her.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is my new all time favorite! I've been looking for a good burrito for a while now. This place hit the spot. Seasoned perfect, rice perfect, and didn't over do the beans! The meat wasn't fatty or chewy. Just right! It was perfection all around. Thank you for the best burrito. I'll be back soon!</Review>

Hands down to one of the best restaurants that offer Mexican food in the area. The customer service is not good but at the same time it is not bad at all. The food was delicious. Really well cooked and was beyond our expectations. The tables are kind of old with a lot of scratches and the restaurant seems very old but that does not reflect on the food. I highly recommend it.<//Text>

I like the food, it's the same thing you get at a TACO truck.  But they take a long time to give you your order.  Some times there's nobody there and they still take a long time.  LOVE TACO Tuesday (it's worth the wait on that day)!<//Text>

Excellent food!  Quick and easy! Order by phone, pick it up. We've known the owner since the 90's, when he cooked in a little bakery in Earlimart!  Food is cooked to order, never a disappointment. Portions, generous, to say the least. Flavor, flavor, flavor. Affordable. Reasonably priced. Ask for Oscar, he's the owner. There is even a diet plate, no carbs... yep! Try it!</review>

Great food fair prices and the salsa is actually SPICY!!! Not like other places where they have to cater to everyone and make it mild it's salsa people it's meant to be spicy< /review>

<Review>Food was subpar. I asked for no vegetables and what do you know? They added vegetables. Then when I returned my food because it was not what I ordered, they took it back to pick the veggies off instead of making me a new a new one. They did a poor job of picking the veggies off mind you, AND my torta was cold by the time I got it back. Also I asked for extra salsa in a cup from the young woman working there and she didnt follow through. Had to ask the guy that brought my food out and she didnt even have the courtesy to apologize. She just asked, "did he give you the salsa?" So she knew she screwed up but didnt apologize. So inconsiderate. By the way it doesnt take 15min to make a torta. Dont go there you will wait a lifetime for your food even when youre the only patron in the restaurant.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Ordered delivery. It wasn't good. Any frozen pizza from the pizza would have been better. Also, the buffalo wings were terrible. I took one bite and gave up.</text>

Fair Customer Service. Fairly tasty pizza,but this however is the 2nd time we waited over an hour for our order. So, if they tell you about 45min: expect 1hr15min.< /review>

Super stingy with the toppings, and the crust tastes like mass-produced frozen pizza. Wouldn't order again.< /Review>

Small market sells fresh vegetables and fresh meat may not have everything you need but it's faster than the big busy supermarkets< /Review>

<review>I can't stress how.much I love the store. The man at the meat section always greets me with a Holla,  and a smile. He recognizes how much I love the ingredient that is used to prepare the meat , that I'm a regular now. This is my to go spot when I BBQ with Family , or friends:.< /review>< userid>

Great Neighborhood Grocery that has been here since before my childhood! Quality service and meat when you get the proper butcher’s! Try to the avoid the older short butcher with white hair and a mustache he tends to be the only one who gives terrible service and trash meat. He tries to sell of the meat that’s about to go bad or already is.... other than that great establishment</text>

<text>We stayed close to this Market, and went in to see what was good.
We became regular costumers to their fruit which was super cheap and the best fruit we've ever had.
Besides that there are a good selection of many different goods to a reasonable price.
And the ATM fee is lower than the standard. Viva Mexico< /text><user_name>Morten Jensen</user_name><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5< /Rate><time>1436043103043< /time><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

Great local store. The only major problem that I continue to have is VERY poor quality customer service in the meat department! Although I continued to go back because it's near by and has everything I look for, I can't continue to allow the lady in the meat department to be rude to people including myself. On several occasions I've seen her toss the orders to customers and is very rude to people with language barriers. Sadly she looks Hispanic herself. This issued has been addressed with manager, but she continues to treat customers so rudely!!! I will definitely NO longer return due to her disrespectful and rude behavior!</Text>

I normally love Kitchen Mouse, but recently ordered two sides of potatoes ($4 each) with my order. When I got the order, it was a hilariously small amount of potatoes. I don’t think it would have amounted to one potato for both of the orders. But I’d spent $8. It was slightly ridiculous. Luckily the breakfast sandwich was super good!</Text>

Kitchen Mouse is a vegetarian restaurant and it's my new favorite spot! Sometimes it does get crowded cause their food is SO good. The servers are super chill and the ambiance is pretty cool too. Parking is kinda hard though.<//Review>

<Review>I ordered an OJ and pats corned beef hash which came with eggs to your liking, some potatoes and your choice of toast (chose the sourdough, obviously). All in all a perfectly good breakfast, healthy portions. The sourdough toast was really good but I couldn't finish all four pieces. The eggs were cooked pretty spot on (over easy). I think the potatoes would have been better off a little more well done.< /Review><date>1605691356709<//date>< user>

One of my preferred places for tasty Vegetarian food. Looking forward to coming back with my coworkers. It has a good atmosphere. Feeling here is similar to a cafe in San Jose I liked.</Text>

< review>
Kitchen Mouse is a vegetarian restaurant on 59th avenue and Fig. Atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. Interior decor resembles your own kitchen house with accented lights and classic dinner tables/chairs. Similarly, it is well organized, neat and lots of natural light. Outdoor seats are available albeit very limited. Prices are a bit on the high end for HP neighborhood. They accept cash and credit/debit card. Staff are friendly and professional. On a busy day, service can be slow and long lines. You need to order first before you take a table. We ordered their three stacks House Pancakes, made of oat, buckwheat, and corn flour with blue berries/strawberries, toasted coconut and maple syrup; and two scrambled eggs. Pancakes were flavorful and fluffy and thick; the eggs are perfectly cooked and their coffee was just good. Overall, if you like veggie breakfast KM is the place to be.<//review>

<review>Amazing hide away a block away from the hustle and bustle of Wilshire. The pastry selection is good and the calm atmosphere and lighting makes this place an ideal spot to study. Coffee is great too! I wish I had stopped here years ago.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Got the breakfast tacos, added the salsa roja & avocado. The food was fantastic! It's on the pricier side (approximately $15 with the add-ons), but the quality of ingredients is high, and the food is very fresh & flavorful.

We got the moros cakes to share, and they were delicious as well. It has a hipster vibe, and the food does not disappoint.</Text><userid>106909110710387375233</userid><Response>{'time': 1529347271796, 'text': 'Thank you, Vaughn!'}</Response>< Pictures>

I STILL dream about their Mikey’s Chilaquiles. Sooooo good. 😋 Their house pancakes with oat corn and buckwheat paired with their maple butter explodes with taste in your mouth. I just ate their organic mushroom and asparagus frittata and it was incredible. Their vegan and gluten-free options are just as delicious, too. Their Prickly Pear Passion Chia Pudding is as scrumptious as it is refreshing. Needless to say, I will be ordering Kitchen Mouse even when I’m not on set. They have a true fan in me.< /Text><user_name>Michael Cornacchia<//user_name></record>

The food is delicious and the place is adorable, it’s great for brunch. The only drawback is that it’s really popular so you may have to wait in line on the weekends, but the food is great I highly suggest eating here.<//Review>

All of the details in the restaurant seem carefully thought out and purposeful from the eco friendly toilet paper in the bathroom to the vanilla bean maple syrup and so many more!
It was the perfect environment for super flavorful food and an oasis for parents and kids.<//text>

<text>Good vegan and vegetarian breakfast options. Loved that you could sub out eggs for avocado or tofu scramble on most dishes. Yummy vegan treats, non-caffeinated hot beverages in addition to coffee, vegan cheese, the works! The “crab” benedict and the tofu scramble were amazing. My only complaint is that the serving sizes were quite small and it was pretty crowded. I’d avoid coming here during prime time because there was a long line.< /text><Rating>4< /Rating>< gmapID>

<Review>The cute, retro kitschy decor is only the beginning at Kitchen Mouse. Catering to the vegan gluten-free crowd, the breakfast tacos can be made with either egg or tofu. I'm neither, so I chose the egg option and added the optional avocado. It was really good. Fresh corn tortillas filled with scrambled egg, lettuce and greens and drizzled with delicious creamy sauce.  I also opted for a strawberry corn muffin that was also delicious. My friend ordered the Sunshine Bowl which had seasonal fruit nestled on top of fresh homemade yogurt  and sprinkled with granola. Garnished with chia seeds and an edible flower, she said it was refreshing. She also had a gluten-free chocolate donut that she said was really good.  They offer bottomless coffee and free wifi as well. Definitely recommend Kitchen Mouse.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I showed up late and my friend ordered for me. Whatever it was, it was yummy and healthy. Very Californian/Mexican. Don’t go there over brunch time on weekends if you want quiet. Very very kid friendly and community oriented with play area in the back.</Text>< rating>

Eggs are optional for vegans that want to avoid them in some of the meals offered such as the chilaquiles dish. The quinoa I had was delicious and tasted like it had sesame oil. It looked like a light meal but I was honestly surprised to find myself asking for a to-go box. Definitely recommend.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgkyvK3hmJHSqFFKwktTp9xS9gZqwCVRrDZHpq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>{'time': 1520964954002, 'text': 'Thank you, Davis!'}< /response>< gmap_id>

Very cute & cozy & TASTY!  It does get understandably busy on Sunday mornings (long line out the door, down the block) BUT I had no trouble finding a parking spot (that was just lucky) and was able to get a table no problem (I was there by myself, but there was availability for larger parties too). 👍👍👍👍<//Review>

Second time ordering from this place. Seems a little overpriced for the quality of the food, forgotten order on takeout purchase, and unusual and rude demeanor of staff at front register. Heard alot of great things about this place but it misses the mark for me.</review>

They also give you complimentary mini corn muffins - probably some of the best corn muffins I've had in LA.

This is by far our favorite spot for healthy, alternative  comfort food. Love the atmosphere and all their plants. Staff is friendly. Ginger Hibiscus iced tea is a must, so are their vegan cookies. Get here early, sometimes the line is out the door.<//review>

<Review>Deliciously surprising vegetarian food. Cute layout that connects to a cute store which I couldnt visit. Outside tables are pet friendly, outside only. Good menu, time sensitive, intriguing dishes. Went for lunch and had a warm chai tea and uncle Joe's breakfast sandwich. Tea was great, sandwich is a delicious mess, grab extra napkins, soo worth it. Breakfast tacos were also a hit. Relaxing and welcoming, almost comforting.  Best vegetarian spot in LA</Review><pics>None</pics><rating>5</rating>< Date>

<review>I've been here only once but was very impressed. Will definitely return. It's a spacious cafe that also feels cozy. Cute interior decor and great service. Food's quality is high and price competitive for this area. Plenty of street parking and reasonable open lots. In a very happening part of HP. Safe and easy to locate.<//review>< date>

<Review>I’ve been coming here for a few years now and I’m at the point where it feels like home. I love the staff and the cozy environment. Recently I’ve been so happy that I can get my morning coffee and breakfast at Kitchen Mouse and then pop over to TOPO for some ready-made lunches. While I love just about everything on the menu... my go-to is the Chilaquiles with a fried egg and a single snickerdoodle pancake (if I have a sweet tooth that day). I love this place so much, it’s extremely family friendly (they have an entire play-area so your kids can play while you enjoy your food).

So happy I live so close to such a special place.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< resp>

<review>Okay, so this may not justify the four star rating.  I'm not vegan, so trying the vegan cheese sauce for the first time wasn't a good idea.  It might take some ti.e to acquire a taste for it.  I had the chilaquiles, which weren't too bad, but the cheese sauce didn't hit the spot.  If you're vegan this is a good place for you.  Let's talk about the coffee... great, but pricey.

Enjoy!</review>< user_name>

My favorite part of the meal was the array sauces that you can try to go along with the arepa. They also had a nice selection of bottled beers for the limited menu. Service wise the food came out pretty quick.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1557856762774, 'text': 'Hi Marie, I think this review may be for another restaurant, but we do love arepas!'}< /resp>< gmapID>

< review>
HP is on its way to gentrification and Kitchen Mouse is part of this transformation.  Missing a couple of stars NOT because of the food.

Very long line, long wait, would have been nice to have been greeted and informed as it's not clear that you need to wait in line first to order before sitting down. You can't see the sign letting you know this because the sign is at the bottom of the counter and people are standing in front of it.  I thought people standing in line  were ordering to go.

After you order, it's all self service after that.  You need to get your own water, coffee, condiments.  They serve you your food and no one ever comes back to check on you.  Not sure that is the norm or if they're under staffed.

Very cute hipster space, but not a place for strollers.

Now that I know the rules of play, the food was good enough for me to go back and I'll give it another try.< /review>

<text>Kitchen Mouse is always a great place to go to. It's usually pretty busy each time I go there, but I always find a place to sit. Parking can be so-so, but over all the food is great and I like that they have lots of healthy options for sure.< /text><Name>Chris Colman</Name><Time>1567790589633<//Time>< Rate>

I love the ambience and vibe of the place.  It's very healthy and I found it to be a tad unsatisfying.  I ordered the chilaquiles and the sauce was really tasty but everything on the plate felt random.  I also had a side of snickerdoodle pancake and it was such a healthy pancake that it shouldn't be associated with snickerdoodle. They gave us a taste of a corn muffins with a spicy jam and the spicy jam amazing but the corn muffin was somewhat underwhelming.  I'd go back to have a coffee and an egg dish and enjoy the bustle.<//review>

<review>This place was great and just what our group was looking for. Super tasty breakfast stuff and good tacos too. Everything vegan except for eggs. I will definitely be coming back when I am around this area.  Very bright open space and good table layout. Easy enough parking on the side streets around it.</review>< Pics>

Excellent on my first visit here. Atmosphere was casual and light. The food was beyond flavorful. Colorful dishes, fantastic teas and drinks.  I am returning.
(only negative, is choice/ loudness of the music playing)
Don't forget to swing by the fabulous Mr Holmes Bakehouse, literally around the corner. Mouth watering desserts.</Review>

<review>This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. Located in Highland Park, it's the perfect breakfast place for vegans and vegetarians. Even my husband who isn't vegan enjoys this restaurant. There are plenty of delicious options but my favorites are chilaquiles and a side order of snickerdoodle pancakes. It's heaven on Earth! The snickerdoodle pancakes come with the most amazing coconut whipped butter I've ever had. In terms of drinks I really love their lattes with almond milk and iced tea. Sometimes they gift mini cornbread muffins during their brunch service. If you have kids there's a play area in the back to keep them entertained. If you like to eat solo there's a wrap-around bar perfect for dining alone and people watching. Last but not least be sure to get there early because on the weekends there is normally a line. It's also great cuz you can order at the counter and not have to deal with splitting any checks when going with groups. Don't forget to go to their gift shop next door which has the most amazing merchandise for gifts or treating yourself!<//review><user_id>104111346421280875154<//user_id><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

<text>Fantastic vegetarian joint, adorably decorated and rampant with hipsters. Even as a non-vegetarian, I love the food here. The breakfast sandwich, the sunshine bowl, the pancakes, and the chilaquiles are all fantastic. It's great for breakfast/brunch/lunch and a good place to have a coffee chat or read a book. You want it to be less expensive for how small the portions are, but you spend the money anyway. The coffee is also good!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1522037262872< /Date><gmapID>0x80c2c411b7031fa9:0xb0e306ea8a24fed0<//gmapID>< Response>

Very cute cafe with excellent food options. Their summer special for jackfruit tostadas is e x c e l l e n t. Wish i would have taken a picture of it! They are advertiser friendly for local business, especially for queer people. They givr credit to the artists who help make their cafe look as beautiful as it is. First time visit, hoping to visit again when I come back to L.A.< /Text>

<userid>100598586247323433406</userid><Review>Finally, a place that can combine healthy and tasty, and serve arguably the best breakfast in Los Angeles.

Searching for the perfect breakfast, this place is it!

Where else can you find tempeh on the menu, so many vegetarian and vegan food options, and the pancakes are not made with white flour.

Good job, kitchen mouse, leading the way to the future of food.

The food is not only good for you, but it’s good for the environment, and this small place we call earth.

No animals have to lose their life for you to eat here, and it turns out, eating like this lowers ones risk of heart disease and stroke.

Only improvement I can suggest? Please have more keto, low carb options.

But this is it. As more and more people realize the benefits of a plant based diet, whole wheat ingredients, vegetables, there will be more demand for such restaurants in the future!< /Review><username>Arsen Hovanesyan< /username><pics>None<//pics>< time>

<Text>Kitchen Mouse is an institution in our house. This is one of the best vegan restaurants that I've ever been to (maybe *the* best) and is local with a very relaxed atmosphere. They are busy for breakfast as they should be, but don't miss lunch. Everything is great and I would make my way here even if it were not down the street.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They have now expanded and doubled in size!  Lots of tables now. Versus when they first opened.
Pancakes are awesome, and gluten free!  My buddy doesn't care whether or not something has gluten. And he said these were the tastiest pancakes he's had in a long time.

Girlfriend had the breakfast sandwich. She didn't like it.... She loved it!  I had a bite of it. I could see why.

Service is great and very friendly!

Bon appetite!< /Review>< pictures>

A tinge of trendy but worth the hype. Food is thoughtful yet accessible with no pretentiousness. Food is made with care and attention that comes through in amazing taste. A great spot for breakfast and lunch in Highland Park.</text>

Food's great, very good, healthy. A bit too pricey. Go in but 1nce e/ 2, 3 months... I've lived in HLP almost 30 yrs, and I've never seen a place like this. I ❤ it! And if I were able to be here more often, I'd certainly be coming back many more times a week.</Text>

Love the gomasio rice cakes (with over easy eggs and side of avocado). The combination of flavors is diverse and pointed across duration of meal.

The ambience is great: lots of hip looking people and young families, one table almost always has a baby, friendly staff, high vaulted ceiling and Mediterranean colors, with large windows and lots of natural lighting.</Review>

<text>Really a terrific place for breakfast.

The snickerdoodle pancake was yummy and not too sweet — I’d ask for a second dollop of butter. Ideally for me there would be some other flavors and textures on the plate but I enjoyed sharing these.

The chilaquiles with a side of tofu scramble were terrific. Lots of different flavors and textures on this plate.

It’s helpful that the coffee is self-serve but I wished they offered oat milk, as they do for the espresso drinks.

So cute that they have a play area for little ones in the back.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>I love getting the day old bakery goodie bags in the morning!  It's a dream of a place to eat for no gluten or dairy.  Coffee lovers that must have regular cow's mucus, they offer that too.  Glory Bowl, morros cakes and the crunchy rice kale salad (but only when the rice is crunchy do I like it) are my favorites!  Any baked good will sure to delight!< /text><user_id>116532026362198487916< /user_id></record>

<Time>1518640190184< /Time><Rating>4<//Rating><review>This gem of a restaurant serves health vegetarian options, the food is fabulously delicious, fresh and favorable. My favorite dish is the "Chilequiles" served with a homemade Chile sauce (very mild) avocado, black beans and a delicious cabbage salad. Trimmings include two sauces (wish I had the recipes) lime and crunchy pepitas. Bring an appetite, it's a large portion! You can order a side of eggs if you want.
Bring plenty of change, parking is metered. While you're there, Mr. Holmes Bakery is just around the corner, they serve the very best pastries. I would buy them before your breakfast/lunch at the Kitchen Mouse, once they run out, that's it until the next day.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Great place for brunch, casual and serve tasty food. Its not a completely vegan place since they serve egg and milk. But most their brunch items are tasty. I would recommend the avocado tlt ( tempeh bacon, avocado, salad on millet toast) and huevos ranchero. They both tasted great. Also you won't feel bloated or food coma after leaving this place.<//Review>< Date>

This place is expensive. The seating area is really nice. The portions are ok. I tried the chilaquiles and the cinnamon coconut pancakes. Those were a healthy version of Mexican chilaquiles and were not bad but I definitely wouldn't get it again. The pancakes I would they were really good.<//Review>

<review>Bougie.  Small portions. Overpriced.  It’s the squirl of highland park, aka a place for trust funders to meet up and wear their normcore clothes and totally suck.  Highland park is being ruined at a thousand miles an hour and this place is quintessential.< /review><Date>1544509216664< /Date></record></dataset><record>

I have tried most things on their menu and can say with confidence that while it may not be great for your body to eat here everyday, your soul will thank you. I particularly like their baked goods, their breakfast tacos, their avocado TLT, and the buffalo bowl.</text>< Pics>

Food is good and at reasonable price. But it took them a pretty long time to get the food out, so not a perfect choice if you're in a rush.</Review>

When I go to a vegan or vegetarian restaurant, I like to get tempeh. So I got the chili since it had tempeh. But I normally do not like chili. This was a chili I indeed liked and the cookies while small were also delicious.</review>

Excellent vegetarian and vegan cuisine with a hometown country kitchen hippie vibe. I'm by no means a vegetarian, but this is a great place to stop for lunch or breakfast, especially with my friends who have more selective diets. Kitchen Mouse does have eggs for those of us who aren't vegetarian and the Stumptown drip coffee is self-serve and pretty darn good, or espresso and coldbrew if that's your jam.

They've got rice and veggie bowls, tacos, and standard breakfast fare like eggs, toast, and pancakes, or varieties of salads if you're looking for lunch fare.  I most recently had the weekend special, the jackfruit crab benedict. It's different, much lighter than a normal benedict, I don't think it had any bread, just eggs, seasoned jackfruit, and hollandaise on a bed of citrusy arugula. It was delicious, but could have used a bit more seasoning and I wish it came with toast as it wasn't terribly filling.

The line get pretty long on the weekends and seating can be hard to find, best to get here early if you want to beat the brunch rush. You order at the counter, paper menus can be found near the register. They'll give you a number to place on your table.</Review>

<text>Crabby Jackfruit cakes are my favorite Brunch item on the weekends, with a pignoli cookie for dessert. Although usually I eat the cookie before the meal.
During the week I'm usually torn between the Huevos Rancheros or the Morning Glory Bowl or the Tacos, both kinds....

I haven't had anything bad there. My kid loves the hot chocolate too with the coconut whip on top!</text>< date>

Straight up amazing food! This spot is vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free/ celiac friendly. The veggie tacos are sooo delicious (The mushroom and tempeh tacos on the dinner menu are amazing!) and the veggie breakfast choices are perfect (be sure to get a side of tempeh bacon and/ or veggie sausage). Can't recommend it enough!</text>

<time>1496948566961</time><rating>2<//rating><Review>ALWAYS NOISY.  Have had a hilarious time or two trying to order at the order-counter-register; wait-person and I could not hear each other over the bad music. You have to ratchet down expectations and assume loud group conversations, crying kids, random high pitched electronic messaging to the kitchen, trying to be drowned out with the bland music. I know, I know, I'm not in a library setting, I realize. (Though, they do have a fair collection of diverse cookbooks for your reading pleasure.) During a recent (usually) short wait for food, I downloaded a Decibel measuring smartphone app.  Just as I thought, 65 to 80 db, which the app says ranges /compares normal conversation at 3 feet to vacuum cleaner and alarm clocks (next level is power mower.) Evidence enough that this not just a figment of my imagination or misanthropic view. (Although....)
I usually order the GLK breakfast, or Avocado TLT or the whachacallit open-faced sandwich with sauerkraut on top. The rest makes me squeamish.
The vegan faux-Mexican dish my lunch-date ordered was a failure, obviously needing some visual help. It looked particularly disgusting. Doesn't culinary training encompass serving the food in an appearance that is appetizing and tasty?  Frequently notice the over use of salt here, especially in salads, even when requested not to add it. You'd think a health-concern such as this would be intuitive.  Hipsters sometimes are not so hip, I guess.<//Review>< pictures>

It's some vegetarian business. I'm a little resistant to vegan foods trying to be things they aren't, so I stick to things that are really vegetarian by nature, and I'm not disappointed.< /Review>

Great vegan food, and they can make non- vegan as well, nice cute place, not that lauded, prices are okay,  they have a mini playground for little kids, I'll definitely come back again.</text>

(Translated by Google) A place that serves healthy and delicious food, the kind of thing you can easily find in LA, but each brings its own approach, making each place unique. And the Kitchen Mouse is no exception.

The food served is organic, vegan, gluten-free and yet it is very tasty. You can order whatever you want, it will be tasty, well seasoned and even generous, Justifying the price a little above average.

The food served is organic, vegan, gluten-free and even so it is not tasty. You can order whatever you want it will be tasty, well seasoned and even generous, justifying the price a little above average.

Um lugar que serve comida saudável e deliciosa, o tipo de coisa que até que se encontra facilmente em LA, mas cada um traz a sua abordagem, tornando cada lugar único. E o Kitchen Mouse não é exceção.

A comida servida é orgânica, vegana, gluten-free e nem por isso ela não é saborosa. Pode pedir o que quiser que vai ser gostoso, bem temperado e com uma porção até que generosa, justificando o preço um pouco acima da média.< /text>
