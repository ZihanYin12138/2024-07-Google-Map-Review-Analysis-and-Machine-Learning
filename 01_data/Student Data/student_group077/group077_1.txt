<review>You can tell it's like a mom and pop grocery store, at least that's the feel. Prices are a little higher but you are paying for convenience. Think of Save Mart without the quality. Their associates are genuine and for the most part are friendly, cashiers  especially. Use this grocery store for what it's meant for. A stop for when you want to make dinner, not a place to grocery shop in bulk.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I love my local neighborhood market. Always great staff.  Produce section always clean and fresh. I know where everything is. Meat is good quality. Store is always clean. I'd give five stars if I didn't pay 10 to 15% more for many items but I prefer to keep it local and I believe you have to pay for convenience.<//Review>

*** DON'T SHOP HERE *** Bought Four T-bone Steaks on 29 Feb 2020, they went bad on 01 Mar 2020.  I took them back to swap them out.  The manager demanded a receipt and accused me of not buying them the day before.  The person I checked out with was standing right there and confirmed I bought them yesterday.  The manager still demanded a receipt and was passive-aggressive to me the whole time.  $40 worth of steaks down the drain...  BBB complaint filed.<//Review>

<Text>Best Buy Market is a store that carries a lot of natural foods and an excellent butcher that will cut special meats for the customers. The produce is fresh daily and displayed beautifully. Fresh baked pastries and breads in that department and the best juice selection of pure juices. Each and every employee has respectfully greeted me and welcomed me to the store. Awesome experience with them and a comfortable enviornment. They are ALWAYS available for any needs and questions.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< Review>
An absolute gem! The staff is friendly and will walk you to where an item is instead of pointing fingers for directions.

I found the parking lot clean as well as the inside of the store. Store shelves were stocked and clean.

The produce dept was well stocked with top quality produce.

I next found myself  in the meat and seafood dept. The quality excellent Harris Ranch along with 10oz lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, and jumbo king crab legs.

I highly recommend this store.< /Review>

<username>Jeremy Hansen< /username><Review>Very crowded and disorganized at times; ......During the evening hours of business... I could not find a cashier that even looked decent without tattoos or piercings... At the minimum wage per hour those employees should be working a lot more than on their cell phones... I would like to speak to a manager... A lot of the workers are just there for a paycheck, getting part time work to get money to go through college... No work ethic.. Or most girls get pregnant before they decided what to do in life< /Review><gmap_id>0x8094c312b1d0e847:0x874f56111133ea50</gmap_id>< Time>

I have picked up my order twice from this location in the last couple weeks or so. Overall, my family has had a good experience from placing the order on their mobile app, picking up from their location, and eating our order.  Our last pizza was missing the "Hut favorite" crust. I know I ordered it since I see it in my email receipt. Hopefully they won't mess up my order in future orders.</text>

<Review>We have ordered from here several times. Our order is always correct, hot and fresh. It's always arrived before the given time. (Lost a star, because the last 2 times, it was 20 minutes late)

The website makes it super easy to order, and most of the time, have good deals. Their pizza is a little on the higher side. But, not bad.

The pizza is really Good. Light and airy cruust. Not greasy. They put a nice amout of sauce and cheese. Toppings are usually good. They don't put a ton. But a good amount.

We got free cheese bread with our order tonight. Pretty darn good. Last time we ordered the honey bbq wings, and none of our family of 6 liked them. This time we got the garlic parmesan. Those were pretty good.

Good food.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFd_Q2kUARRX9Nux4GtN-r1jEOPSlbDRWNPRmi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqJzKn3siGmMz5z0zA8IbnlsaUSlPn0IL4Inpx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_ws6CH3tcE5oXoDtTjxp35YLdovl47eExG9vX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMF5L5Q8rAegTpCNayLts1q24iqPeQFBmIaYuq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaEOELfH3lUOiALOCdQGi-myjFY_mMVNReLNte=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<review>More cheese on the pizza and more vegetables. I paid a decent price but theres was barely any cheese and only a few vegetables. I asked for light sauce and that was done. But seemed like like vegetables and cheese. I didnt ask for that.</review>< username>

Ordered parmesan garlic wings and the wings were plain with no seasoning. One of the pizzas ordered had a white sauce instead of a red sauce. I thought all pizzas defaulted to red sauce.<//Review>

< review>
Although all the years that I’ve been purchasing delicious food from this Pizza Hut I was disappointed this time around. I Purchased breadsticks with marinara sauce and my husband got home with the food and there was no marinara sauce. We could’ve driven back but the time it would’ve taken me to go pick it up and come home the food would of been cold.  I wish they would of double checked the order before they gave it to us. I did call and let them know that they forgot it and they asked me to come back but that is so inconvenient. They should’ve gotten my order right in the first place.< /review>

I asked for garlic parmesan crust and got plain both times. I ordered and paid for two ranch dressings, didn't get them. I ordered mild wings the first time and got some sweet tasting wings. Then the staff arent the most professional, its like they hired high school kids who don't take their job serious. I am so frustrated that if I ever do decide to eat pizza hut again it def wont be the archilbald and walnut location, which sucks because I live across the street smh.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Price and quality just isn't there. There's better quality pizzas and there's cheaper "readymade" pizzas. Wings are pretty good though</review>

Beware! Food Poisoning! The pizza smelled and tasted funny. We all got sick and they refused a refund! They asked for a doctor's note! Close this business down.<//text>

<text>Pizza was good. Only thing wrong they spelled my name wrong. Even though I told them the correct way to spell it. They keep trying to spell Lili with a y (lily), when that's not how I spell my first name. Second time they've done that and it's becoming annoying to have to have my name spelled correctly.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This Pizza Hut is the best. I see the other reviews on Google and the one thing they don't realize is that these employees value honesty and genuine kindness from the customers, which is completely  understandable. They got one of my pizzas wrong and i very kindly showed them and they gave me credit for it. I would never be rude to one of them because we are all human and make mistakes.
Show them respect and they will so the same! (They might even throw  something in for free!)< /review>< user_id>

I haven’t even gotten my pizza yet But this is solely based on the the service I received over the phone. I was being helped by a women who seemed to be older. She acted very mature, professional, and nice. To be honest it made want to always take my business there to Pizza Hut. Usually the phone is answered by a young kid who almost nearly ruins the order but she seemed VERY capabale. GREAT SERVICE!</Text>

The pizza was good. However I ordered a Pizone and it much more dough than pizza. At best, it only had enough toppings for two slices of pizza. Five bucks for two inward slices of pizza!!!! What a RIP off!!<//text>

Pizza is ok. Nothing to brag about. Their math doesn't make sense though. One side of ranch is $.60 but if you buy two they're $1.50 ($.75 each) plus tax for a total of $1.70 how much sense goes that make?</review>

<Review>I love Pizza Hut food and they do it as well as anyone. I ordered on line for carry out and everything went well until pick up time. I came with a Pizza Hut gift certificate to pay for it, but they wouldn't accept that. They are a "franchise" and don't accept the corporate gift certificates. So stars for the pizza only, not for customer service.<//Review>< pictures>

My pizza took 2 and a half hours, others took just as long. Managers in gray shirts were to young to manage a high volume place like Eastvale. Place was dirty, and employees were very busy doing nothing. Bathroom was filthy. It appeared that delivery took priority over dining and takeout. Line was out the door.</text>

just rude... the workers were very rude. if i could i would give 0 stars. i dont recommend ordering at night. the staff have attitude and honestly just want to close up. the phone was ringing and they didnt want to pick it up. when we came in the workers ignore us for a good solid 10 minutes until someone else came for their order. when the worker showed them their pizza it was horrible. the vegetables looked expired and gross. me and my daughter were shocked we always come ti the same pizza hut and the staff are always nice ,considerate, and give us our pizza fast and efficently. if you want good customer service and pizza ORDER IN THE DAY NOT NIGHT< /review>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Don’t order a pizza an hour before close cause they will make up every excuse in the book to not work. They cancelled our order due to “battery problems” in the delivery drivers car cause they are closing soon. Keep up the horrible customer service and you will find yourself out of business.

<Review>Ordered a pizza online. Delivery came and was prompt but I payed with card and didn't leave a tip at the time. I made sure to cross out the option just in case. Next day I saw the delivery guy gave himself a $10 tip. I called the store and talked to the manager whom preceded to downplay the federal crime while offering me a $25 Gift card. Claimed their delivery personnel sometimes do this on the regular for no tip receipts. After further arguments were going nowhere, I accepted and vowed to the manager of never ordering from them or their organization again. To this day, I never got that gift card</Review>< Pics>

<review>Lived there for ~9 months, early terminated to move back to south bay.

Good:
- Good price in this area
- 90% Quiet & good structure to block outside noise
- Staff is good.
- Good gym with squat machine - better than south bay ones.

Bad:
-2 inner-noise. The exhausting pipe is connected to neighbor's living room. They had a crying baby at 6am. And suddenly it became my problem and disrupted my sleep. They should either offer discount or allow people to know what family composition is in their neighbor. Imaging flying a overnight plane every night with a crying baby onboard.
- $300 parking fee - well, it is SF. can't blame anyone
- Still pricy, but it is SF< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>My experience here living with @fvcproductions in another review has been great! I've been here for 1.5 years about. The rent is moderately high but totally reasonable in that you have all the amenities you need in-unit and a nice modern look.

The place has a gym, a rooftop shared area, a hot-tub (that's honestly usually empty), an outdoor grill, stove/washer/dryer/dishwasher in unit, etc etc. Convenient friendly and clean!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

A Lovely Place to Live, With Super Service and Personnel

Rincon Green Apartments is a great place to call home. The community is extremely beautiful, well-kept and peaceful. In fact, everything is so beautiful that I felt like I lived at a resort. The staff always greet residents with a smile, are very attentive to their needs and are quick to attend to any problems that arise. I would like to give special kudos to maintenance worker Andrew and property managers Laila and Janae. Once, I spilled laundry detergent on my apartment's carpet, and I was in a panic because I really don't like the sticky, messy feeling of the laundry detergent residue. I submitted the service request in the morning and Andrew helped me do a deep cleaning of the entire apartment's carpet the same day! What an awesome service! Laila and Janae from the leasing office are super helpful and accommodating. They always try their best to make residents' stay in the community as comfortable as possible. My initial apartment was faced the street, and I couldn't get used to the noise. After learning about the issue, Laila and Janae immediately transferred me to a quiet courtyard apartment at a discounted price. My sleeping quality has since improved significantly!

The apartment could not be in a better location and is close to many shops, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, bars and transportation options. It offers some of the most cutting-edge designs and boutique amenities in the area. Amenities include a community park, rooftop lounge with a hot tub and grill (I have thrown two BBQ parties here, and my guests had a great time and were extremely satisfied), a 24-hour fitness center, concierge and cyber café, on-site Zipcar and panoramic city views. The apartment is within walking distance of the downtown financial district, SOMA, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Visa, MasterCard, and all the major tech companies. It is also just a10-minute walk to Embarcadero Boulevard, where you can enjoy breathtaking views of the bay and the Bay Bridge!

In summary, I really enjoyed my time here, as the apartment was very clean, comfortable and had everything I could need! In addition, the maintenance worker is super-efficient, and the office staff are friendly. I will always recommend this fabulous apartment to others!< /review>

<review>The staff of an apartment building makes all the difference, Rincon Green has very helpful and friendly folks taking care of everything. Also, they are excellent at handling deliveries and packages.

2 years later... Still great!

Rent increases have been reasonable. Two years in a row they offered NO increase IF you renewed early, though sadly not doing that at the moment (Jan 2019)

Did I mention every unit has built in, stacked clothes washer and dryer that they maintain!?  No more shared laundry room nonsense, this was a HUGE point for me personally; your priorities may vary.  And these are small-ish, somewhat compact machines, so you can’t do “gianormous loads”, but a reasonable amount is fine. Dishwasher is also a bit more narrow than full sized ones, at least in my studio apartment, but it works, just smaller loads.

The next 3 topics may sound like negatives, but it’s an attempt to keep a well running building, so I’m not making judgement calls here, just offering “full disclosure”

Temp parking pass is needed even for an hour, and it’s $40, even if you only use 1 hour. I’m guessing they keep it high so SF visitors don’t use it for a generic parking garage, so it’s a bit above regular parking garages, but maybe by only $10 or something - parking in SF SoMa/Financial district is expensive, especially if there’s a game or some other big event.

EV charging: There are a few EV charging station in basement level 2, I forget the service.  3 slots, but there’s usually a vacant slot. I think you still need to pay the $40 if you’re a guest, plus the RV service charge.

AirBNB-able?  ABSOLUTELY NOT. SF may allow it in some buildings, but not here. And it can be a first-offense eviction, and the staff knows the tenants pretty well, and there’s security RFID on the elevators, and I think they maybe even do spot checks for ads, so don’t do it, you’ll likely be caught and possibly evicted.

Also, zero smoking or vaping, can also be an eviction. And no, going out on the balcony or trying to blow smoke into a vent won’t work - it’s a very “green” building so smoke doesn’t dissipate and they will hunt people down if they get complaints.

But again, this is just info to consider, for many of us residents it works out great!<//review><gmapID>0x8085807a14f8b3a1:0xa46e94e321339968</gmapID><rating>5< /rating></record>

<time>1441749296773<//time><Review>We love living here so much that we have recently renewed our lease. Although it is not cheap to live here, we appreciate all the valuable services that this building provides, at a very reasonable rate. You could surely get cheaper, but you will have to deal with shady landlords.

Rincon Green is run by Emerald Fund, who have the most fantastic staff: Laila and Vanessa manage the building, while Sarah and Emyli are the friendliest leasing agents around. Make sure you tell them about my review. They organize monthly get-togethers to introduce you to your neighbours. Joey and Cameron watch over the concierge desk during the day, making sure to sign for our deliveries and greeting guests. At nights, there is very friendly security and the park gates are locked. Jerry and Jairell are maintenance and they make sure everything is in tip-top shape. It's a new building, built in 2012, but when we had trouble with the heat and plumbing, they showed up right away!

The building is really lovely, there's Emerald Park as our front yard, with a playground for the little ones to climb on. Inside the building, there's a courtyard with a rock garden and water fountain. If you get a unit with a balcony, it's easy to forget you are actually living in a big city. There is free Philz coffee in the morning, with complimentary tea throughout the day. We really enjoy using the rooftop hot tub after working out in the nice gym on the first floor. And there's also a couple of communal gas grills for quick no-mess dinners.

As for the units, they are a little small, but with good furniture a couple can live comfortably in a 1-bedroom apartment. You can find the floor plans on their website. Each unit comes with apartment-sized appliances: washer, dryer, stove and oven, microwave, and fridge. Since this is an eco-friendly building, there solar-powered heat but no air-conditioning. Since SF doesn't get that hot or cold, we keep the windows open most of the time. If you need a parking space, that's extra, but they do have ports for cars to charge.

We don't really need one, because there are three Zipcars available in the parking garage. And we ride our bikes, which are safely locked up in the storage rooms. You also get Webpass for Internet, which is speedy and reliable. They have Laundry Lockers downstairs if you want someone else to handle your clothes. You can also rent a storage locker, but I think they have a deal with Omni for on-demand storage. And they have a deal with Zeel for discounted massages.

There are a couple of disadvantages though: the sidewalks in the area are often unusable due to the condos popping up all over Rincon Hill. There is also the new Transbay Terminal that is being built, so it does get noisy on the weekends. And since it's close to the Bay Bridge, with its on- and off-ramps, traffic does back up on Harrison St.<//Review>< response>

<Text>Out of the way specialty type market. Carries a lot of random items from other countries  and other odds and ends but also the usual grocery items. They have Harrison Ranch beef and it's delicious. People are nice, it's never crowded. Sometimes closed without warning for filming.</Text></record>

I go here every time I'm out skateboarding and it's a great stop. there's usually not many people in the store so if you're only getting one or two things it'll be an in and out experience. I've never had a bad experience with an employee either they're very nice.<//text>

<review>Super friendly staff, quaint little small business grocery store. LOVE their BBQ deals on weekends and holidays! Might be slightly higher priced than the corporate grocery chains, but comparable if you shop the sales and the friendly service is well worth it!<//review>< pictures>

So anyone that lives in west hills knows this place survives on the income it generates from Hollywood movies or videos that use it as a supermarket venue.   So if by chance you see a large presence of camera crews you’ll know to avoid the store as they generally close while shooting.

CONS: Their prices are as high or higher than you’d expect to find at an convenience store.   And they have a poor and minimal produce section so if your looking for some exotic fruit or vegetable don’t waste your time.

PROS:  Always super clean and in order. Shelves are blocked with military precision. Staff are very nice and courteous.  Classic Rock is played over the loud speakers ;-)

CONCLUSION:  Doubtfull you’ll be using Fields Market for all your grocery needs, but instead as a convenience store so expect to pay high prices (30-50% more).</Text>

I really like this Market it's too bad it's going away. It's never crowded, has clean fresh produce and a great quality meat section also. The rest of the place is like any normal grocery store but often they don't have some of the items that you might like. The wine section here is terrible. What makes it so nice is the prices are reasonable and there's hardly ever anybody in here which makes it feel like it's my own store.< /text>

<Text>This store has changed owners quite often over the years so many times that I forget the name of the store.
These owners seem to be more interested in renting/leasing out the location to be used in movies and television.  I dont have an issue with that.  If they can make money doing that, well good for them.
But...they are not able to match the prices of large stores like Ralphs or the cleanliness and large varietu of Pavilions and with a Super Vallarta opening soon I wont have any reason to make a trip there only to find they are closed for filming.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<user_name>Michael Smock</user_name><text>Modern sushi and Japanese cuisine with a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Wow. What a cool little spot. We came in right as they opened for their dinner hours and were lucky enough to catch a table. It seems like it is not a bag idea to have a reservation, at least on a weekend, because they were busy from the moment they opened. It is a very small space, so it gets crowded fast, and we can tell why. The food was excellent.

The whole experience was top notch. The laid back music on low in the background and the busy atmosphere gave it a real homie feel. Our server, Matt, was on his game and extremely friendly. He had a great feel for the crowd and was right there as soon as we even thought of a want or desire. I never believed in psychics before, but now I'm questioning things.

Price wise, it was definitely fair for the community it is in and what you expect from a typical sushi establishment. Then you eat the food and realize it is more than fair, it's a deal. The quality of the items on the plate and the skill at which they are prepared are very high end, but the price tag is not. I look forward to dining here again.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6mFHl3_bCbaJtGqEc9MkWecZS77gc540wGdAP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaJrIKzLakUYBtSl3BH_S-8E0FqH_XKsATgyAK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><rate>5<//rate><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Delicious food and friendly service. The restaurant is quite small so reservations are a good idea for dinner. Good selection of sushi rolls.< /review>

<Text>Very disappointing.  Was told this was a good Japanese restaurant, but that was not my experience. The soup was small and tasted like canned chicken with warmed up frozen vegetables and was not as described on the menu. And I could go on by describing the bland food the others in my party received. To tell you the truth, I've had better Japanese food at a stand at the mall in the city.< /Text>< Date>

Never have seen such TINY sushi.  Cute but even as an appetizer two half bites for $8 is pretty ridiculous.  For better sushi, bigger portions and reasonable pricing you're better off going to Sierra Market a few blocks away.  Yakiniku was very dry and tasteless without the dipping sauce.  The best part of the visit was an excellant waiter.   Too bad!<//review>

Been a customer since this place opened. It was our favorite!! Where they knew your name, amazingly creative with their bites, nice portions and prices, and all with super friendly accommodating staff. My pics to their FB page radiated that. However since all the changes in staff, possibly owners, we dont go very often anymore. The bites got smaller and the prices have gone up. The cherry blossom for example. Staff wasn't as inviting and open. Just a whole different atmosphere. I do like the creative drinks they make. And their not open as much as they used to. They were closed on a Saturday on labor day weekend!! First time in months we decided to go. Disappointing.<//Text>

Great Japanese food! Try the "Calaveras", you won't be disappointed. Also try their Chicken or Shrimp Curry Bowl, delicious. Best Japanese food this side of Japan Town.< /Text>

The prices are a bit high but on par with the tourist atmosphere. It's popular and the small seating area is usually packed but it's worth the wait.< /text>< pics>

I simply wanted a bowl of soup after a weekend snowboarding with my boyfriend at Bear Valley. On our drive home we stopped in Murphys and found Doke Sushi. Oh how I wish we'd just gone on a little further to Copper. The experience was pretty awful overall, though, the food itself was okay.

After being seated at the sushi counter, it took the one waitress who was working a long time just to acknowledge us. Then she finally came over and took our drink order only. We had to wait a very long time to receive drinks and even order food. Noticing the one sushi chef still hadn't completed the 3 plates for the couple next to us, we knew it would be a while before Brad received his roll and I got my soup.  Wrong. My soup came out almost immediately!!

I commented to the waitress that I'd like to receive my meal at the same time, and she mentioned that the soup was very hot and needed to cool. I took a bite and asked if they'd mind just holding on to it until his food was ready. 15 minutes later he got his plate, and I waited briefly while they heated my soup back up. The soup was ultimately kind of disappointing (but his roll was awesome!) Thai Iced Tea was only $2 but was really weakly brewed.

It should never take an hour to get your one or two item dinner in a restaurant that only seats 20 people total. I don't think this place would survive if there were several competing sushi restaurants nearby.< /Review>< Pictures>

Unexpectedly good sushi in an inland gold rush town. The albacore and yellowtail melts in your mouth. Try the garlic shitake appetizer.

Doke also has options for non-sushi eaters in your group. Curry was good, bento boxes with chicken or beef. Our party of five was delighted.

Came in for a last second Friday the 13th Flash sale and was treated with nothing but kindness!! My friend and I received amazing tattoos from Emma and we had a blast getting em! Would highly recommend as a first shop to try, since they give you a little care package to take home.<//Review>

<text>100% recommend!! Such a clean and good environment!! Alfonso did my tattoo and took his time on all the small details! Kept conversation the whole time and could tell he was so passionate about what he was doing in the moment!!! Can't wait to have him work on another piece! Nicole at the front desk was amazing at calling before my consultation and a day before my actual appointment.  She deserves just enough attention for what she does!! love the customer service, love the atmosphere !:)< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Took my husband here as a present for his birthday. Emma was fantastic, shes was super sweet and considerate to his picky needs. Lettering and shadding was on point. Thanks Emma, we will definitely be back.< /Review>

<text>Super clean studio and convenient location next to the JC. I got my first tattoo at Glass Beetle in October and I highly recommend seeing Amanda if you want realism animals. Not only is her art solid, but her bedside manner is superb; she makes sure that her clients are comfortable and happy with the art! Totally lucked out with my first tattoo experience.</text></record></dataset><record>

I am from out of town and called them to make an appt before leaving for vacation.  I am super impressed!  They got me in right in the same week, shop is beautiful and super clean and they knew right who i was when i went in prior to appointment so they could have a face before appt.  Alfonso did my tatt which was done free hand and he worked very fast but very precise.  This is by far my best tattoo and artist, shop experience.  I would recommend them 100 times over to everyone!  If I ever get out to cali again i will be making another appt!< /Text>

<Review>Car broke down today in the parking lot close to O'Reilly's. The employee went with me to the car with the odbll to see what was wrong with it he went back to after giving me the codes came with battery tester and jump box but it was actually the asb/hcu that went out i got car started i tried to tip him for going out of his way to help me it was a lil bit of a walk to the car my wife yelled his name he looked back i told him i wanted to tip him for going out of his way to help you dont see that anymore...

If I could give this store zero stars i would ! Terrible customer service my husband went in to buy a battery and the guy did not try to install it even though it is free ! He lied to him and told him he was alone but yet there was another employee there with him. My husband asked him what about that guy and Frank because that is his name negatively responded if he wanted to complain to call coorperate to give them more hours ?! Worse experience ever!!!!!!<//Text>

I’m glad I found this dental office!! Came in today for a cleanup and was warmly greeted by Janie. The wait time was minimal which is terrific! Stephanie made the cleanup go great and I was instructed by Dr.Rodrigues how to keep my teeth healthy. I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a fun and professional dentist!< /text>

I found Dr. Rodrigues when I had a tooth ache a few years ago and needed anti biotic. Still weary of dentists I did not get the recommended work done at that time however I have since been back and she is working with me to get my dental health back in order. Staff are very kind and dont make you feel uncomfortable and are very good at making sure you understand different things related to oral care. Would recommend for anyone like me who had a past bad dental experience.<//Text>< Pictures>

Love! Love! Love! Dr. Rodriguez and her staff! First time customer and beyond elated with the consultation, and cleaning! And completing future procedures.
Dr. Rodriguez listened to my concerns and was able to word and understand exactly what I wanted! Very knowledgeable and resourceful.. I am beyond euphoric to call her my dentist! I can’t stop smiling..😁< /Review>

The office is clean and up to date. The staff is pleasant, competent and efficiant. All of my procedures have gone smoothly. Tanya is cute. Dr. Rodriques and her entire staff have reason to be proud of this operation.<//review>

<review>I've been treated by Dr. Rodrigues for over 30 years.  Her office has a clean professional atmosphere, yet at the same time fosters the feeling of 'family'.  All staff conducts themselves in a caring, helpful, and friendly manner, while displaying absolute professionalism.  I refer/recommend them often without reservation.  Dr. Rodrigues continues to treat most of my family, including children as well as adults.   I can honestly say that I enjoy going to the dentist!</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

The nicest people I’ve ever had work on my teeth! Susan the hygienist was so awesome, and she really helped calm me and explain everything she was doing. She also open my mind to a new way at looking at teeth cleaning, it’s a Spa Day for your teeth! Totally self care taking care of your oral hygiene. Dr Olivia was super cool as well, so nice and so calming. I’m so glad I picked this office<//review>

<Text>I called for a price for a deep clean to compare to one I'd been given at a different office. The person that answered the phone was rude and very evasive, refusing to give me any information at all while asking what the other dentist was charging for the service (she also became very short with me after I declined to mention this). In hopes that I was speaking to an receptionist having a bad day, I asked if there was anyone else I could speak to that might be able to help me (she had stated that she couldn't, and was trying to dismiss me), turns out she was the actual dentist DDS Rodrigues. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what but it was very rude and dismissive. I won't be calling again much less visiting.< /Text>< Rating>

< Review>
Took my two year old son to this dentistry, he is usually very shy and scared but the staff helped make him feel very comfortable by warming him up to them and for the first time, we actually had a very pleasant appointment! I’ve been to two other dentists where my son would scream his lungs out and was terrified so I was very surprised of his behaviour. They also got us in very quickly and were very professional and kind. I would highly recommend!<//Review>

I called Dr Rodrigues with emergency tooth pain.  they scheduled me an appointment for the following day.
With the new Covid procedures, I waited in my car and  staff brought me paperwork to fill out. I watched as they constantly sanitized surfaces and door handles.

I waited only a few minutes to see the Dr who was very nice, professional and made me feel comfortable. The entire staff made me feel comfortable and was very helpful in following up with a dental specialist.

I will definitely continue to recommend their office.< /text>

I had an appt but wasn't feeling well and didn't want to get the office sick so I cancelled my app. In Sept. I also had an app on Oct 1 , and again wasn't feeling well so I made sure to cancel my app so I wouldn't get the staff sick. Iam diabetic and have some good days and bad with the same sort of sickness as Covid so iam sorry but don't want to take chances. Now iam told that they won't reschedule me for doing the right thing.Not fair as I was looking out for them?</Text>

<Text>This place is so rude and unprofessional.  Maybe they think they don't have to treat people with respect given their location.  Based on other reviews of them selling unnecessary work to patients I believe they dont have basic decency and kindness.

If I could give 0 stars I would. I went in for an emergency appointment with a really bad toothache The dentist  refused treatment on my tooth because I couldn’t afford to get a crown. (My dental insurance won’t cover crowns) I was told I should sell everything I own to get 1150$ for a crown. And until then she wouldn’t do anything. I told her I don’t have anything to sell because I don’t own anything at the moment and she told me that’s to bad and I should find a different dentist then. Oh and they don’t do payment plans.<//text>

Not impressed. Came in, wasn't allowed to go back with my kids. Dentist seemed too busy to really discuss much with me. The referral they sent the insurance company wasn't filled out correctly or sufficiently, so we were denied. Also, if u don't cancel 48 hours in advance, they drop you. You'll have to call your insurance and have them reassign you to a new dentist and wait till you're covered to see someone else. Like I said, not impressed. Don't bother wasting your time.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Patience, Professionalism, and Patient-centered care are terms that i use to describe this office. Every member of this team shows genuine care for their positions and their contribution to the holistic care of the patient.

Being a healthcare professional myself, I understand the parameters of insurance coverage and cancellation policies. It’s important to check if Dr. Rodrigues’ office accepts your insurance (seems to be a concern in the reviews) by either checking with the front desk or your insurance carrier.. I suggest you do it before you come in. Only makes sense, right? :) They make it so simple! The insurance and billing process is seamless.. they even get preapproval on many procedures to make sure i’m covered before starting!

It’s been such a pleasure to have conversations with the front desk before i get to the dental chair. Friendly and kind all around. Dr. Rodrigues and Dr. Cumby have built a reputable reputation in the Sacramento area over the past several decades. You will find that many of their patients have been returning for 20+ years. I sure have :) So thankful for you all! Thank you!< /Text><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>I don't really know why there are so many 1 star reviews. I have liberty dental (medi-cal) and have had a great experience so far. I hadn't went to the dentist in a long time and I had several cavities I left alone for years. On my first visit, I called and got a same-day appointment. I got my gums cleaned well and lots of x-rays. Dr. Olivia Rodrigues was careful to make sure she found every cavity. I was given an appointment for about a week later and she filled my 8 cavities in one day. She was very careful to make sure I breathed deeply while getting the numbing shots. During the procedure when I seemed uncomfortable she asked if it was painful and gave me a few more shots so I couldn't feel a thing. This was my first time getting any dental work. The fillings are seamless with my teeth and I'm healing well. I also have never had the woman up front be unfriendly.<//text>< username>

<Review>This place is Horrible the woman at the front desk who does billing is absolutely atrocious. They only care about cashing checks and could care less about your actual dental needs. She was extremely rude to multiple times and when I went in with a dental emergency they scoffed could care less and said oh well go to the clinic. Even when I offered to pay out of pocket if insurance could not approve immediately I was treated horribly and was told again go to the clinic. I for one like to build a relationship with the medical professionals I interact with for my health. These people should change their name from family dentistry to check chasers they could care less about anyone’s dental needs. If I could give less than one star I would have!! PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE AND FIND A DENTIST WHO CARES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR DENTAL NEEDS!!!!! NOT THIS PLACE!!!!!</Review><user_id>102738024377165466330<//user_id><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I went to this office they said I needed a crown and it wasn't  covered  and I needed to  pay for it , also I had 9 cavities,  and I  needed a  bridge redone,  I went to a different  dentists  and found  out that I didn't need my bridge redone  and I only had  3 cavities.  And the crown was covered by my insurance,  this place is a  scam  Business  Stay away.</Review>

Let me start off 1st saying that I was extremely scared of getting a shot because of my  Last experiences that I had they hurt so badd and I had to have about 5 or 6 so from that point on I never trusted Dentist Nor could believe that they would give me a shot that I couldn't feel.

After going to this dentist was truly amazing the shot I could not feel a single thing he was so good numbed  me so good that I did not feel any of the shots even taking care of my cavities I felt nothing at all, truly amazing best dentist ever!!< /review>

I am assigned to this office, I called in Tuesday February 27, 2018 for emergency appointment and they would not see me I have a huge whole in my tooth where the temporary crown fell out. The receptionist was rude and non-caring. She said they had no appointments nor emergency appointments, that I could only come in Thursday. While I was saying okay, then thank you she hung up the phone in my face. They were reported to Liberty Insurance<//Review>

I wish I could give 0 stars! They kicked another lady out because she was upset she couldn't be in the room with her 10 year old kid!! The whole time I was there I kept trying to keep my 3 year quite and the receptionist told me right after I told my daughter to quite that I needed to keep her quite. They kicked me out because I kept trying to keep her quite!</Text>

The worse office i have visited in long time. Whoever gave 5 stars probably was paid to do so. The front dest lady is horrible , rude and careless . Never answers calls when you call . I stoped by at the office to talk to her and she gave me ridiculous price for something that was covered by my insurance. I am glad i went to normal friendly office on Sunrise Blvd and they have done awsome job for 0 out of pocket. This office needs to be close for good.< /text>

<Review>Love this shop! I come here all the time for butane cans and whatever dabbing accessories I may need from time to time. Great selection of great products with great prices. The guy running the place is super cool and helpful as well. Been coming here for years and will continue to for years to come.</Review>< UserId.>

Love this shop. Justin is awesome and the owner is chill. I used to buy all my tobacco products here then switched to vaping. Bought 2 vapes here and lots of different juices. They are super helpful and good pricing on all products. Would definitely recommend.< /Text>

The atmosphere is engaging and comfortable. Every time i come here i want to stay just to chat! The owner is super open minded and actually appeals to the demand of the customers. Cigarettes, 420, vaping they have it all! I anticipate such a friendly staff and it is always a pleasure. Highly recommended whether you do or don't know what you like.The owner has associates with knowledge on the products if not she herself has the answers .< /Review>

Call ahead of time, was looking to buy Koi CBD tincture. Guy was super nice and helpful on the phone. Was able to put product aside for me. Right when I walk thru the door I was immediately greeted.  I didn't need to say more the a few words and they already knew who I was. First initial experience was outstanding compared to any smoke shop I've been too. Went I got home, was really satisfied with the flavoring of the product. Next morning, I messaged them through Google, in which they responded within great time.

They were amazing and happily offered to exchange the product. When I arrived,  once again they knew exactly who I was. Not only was he super friendly but he also had a variety of options for CBD products for me to try. As I was paying, his boss called to see if I had stop by and wanted to extend an offer to special order if necessary.  Wow...way over and beyond! I have been in a customer service manager for 16 years and I am completely impressed by their hospitality.

I will most definitely be coming back and hopefully a forever customer.</Review>

< Review>
Place is way over priced when i got an oil burner that cost the most there sales person wrapped it up in papper bag but when I got home to try it out they put the cheap oil burner in there and still the one I paid for the expensive one. I feel like I was being wrong without the common courtesy of holding a gun to my head.</Review>

Absolutely love this place! I come here for all my vape needs. Jen is super knowledgeable and super helpful with all things vape. She's always more than willing to help with my technical problems, answers all my questions, and has a knack for knowing what Ejuice I'll love. I highly recommend this place for all things vaping related. Huge selection of ejuice, mods, tanks and more and at competitive pricing as well. Thanks for the killer deal on my mod, tank, and charger! 😊👍<//review>

I went to Subway, and the guy who took our orders gave my grandpa and uncle the correct orders. I didn't like what I got because I have allergies. I told him I just wanted Ham and Pepperoni. He gave me, Bell peppers, Ham, Pepperoni, Lettuce, Tomato, and Spinach. I don't like to eat spicy foods.<//text>

<Review>It's a good restaurant for Sandwiches made to order for each and every customer. Everything is fresh and well stocked. They have combos or by it's self orders. There is handicapped parking and access and table seating, public restrooms and free refills on the soft drinks. They always have specials and great Cookies and chips too.</Review>< Response>

The employees there were friendly. They made are sandwiches fast since we were in a rush to catch a movie at the drive-in. I forgot my chips on the counter and by the time I realized I was already at the movies. I called and they remembered who I was and said that I can pick up my chips. I went in after the movie was over and the girl who had helped me had them saved for me. Great customer service! Super friendly and kind during my whole experience</text>

< review>
Ordered several cheesecakes via their website for curb-side pickup. Once I arrived, I called the number as requested on my order but I kept getting a busy signal. I didn't want to walk in as I had animals in my vehicle so I kept calling. After about 8 tries, I got a hold of someone. Once I was able to finally speak to someone, my order came out promptly unlike other Cheesecake locations I've been to where I've had to wait for over 30 minutes to receive my food. So, overall - pleased.< /review>

I love coming here for happy hour. The food always tastes delicious and well prepared. I ordered the Brussels sprouts and I highly recommend trying it next time and the sliders. Everything filled me up and the portion size is big enough t share for 2 people. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. I love coming to Cheesecake Factory for any occasion!< /Text>

<text>Really good restaurant to visit with friends and colleagues during lunch. Tons of options and delicious desserts.

Complimentary bread with each meal is incredible. The brown bread (pretty sure it’s wheat) is so good, I have trouble stopping when I start eating it lol.

Pricing varies depending on what you order, but mostly fair across the board.

Staff is always really friendly and helpful.

Might be best to make reservations if you want to be seated when you arrive.

Parking is challenging sometimes during lunch rush in the week, so beware if that.<//text>< Pics>

We went in to get a table for lunch outside. The hostess up front was rude to begin with and she asked if we had masks and we said no but we can wait outside for a table outside. She said you have to wear a mask to the table. We (are vaccinated) and told her that and she said you still need a mask. We said forget it then... walked back through the lobby (indoor) and no one waiting was wearing a mask in the lobby..... seriously???????  🙄</review>

Food was so good. Great service. A long wait even though they said it would be only 20 min. It turned into an hour and a half. That's why it gets 4stars.< /Review>

Great location in the Spectrum (a fun place in of itself to walk and shop). Huge menu with lots of great options for adults, but quite limited on the kids side - particularly for gluten free alternatives.  Save room for a shared dessert!<//text>

Juan was the best server I've ever had. I hD lunch with my sister I hadn't seen in a year.  We had lots of catching up to do. Juan was understanding, funny, helpful, patient and very good at his job. He is the perfect server. Ask for Juan. You won't be disappointed.< /review>

I like Cheesecake Factory a lot and I've been to this particular location a few times and my experience were always negative unfortunately. The food is usually really slow to come to our table and when it arrives, it's cold and looks like it's been sitting out for a while... not sure why this is always the case. They also brought out burnt food for my brother one of the times I was there. The last time I went (6/10/2021), my friends and I had stomach issues (stomach ache, diarrhea, some headaches and mild fever) a few hours after dining there and we've been having stomach issues for a week now (today is 6/18/2021). I'm still suffering from whatever I ate/unclean dishes or silverware and as someone who has had the stomach flu often growing up, this is by far the longest I've ever had chronic diarrhea. After so many bad experiences, I will no longer be going to this location of the Cheesecake Factory.< /Text>

I seem to have bad luck at Cheesecake Factory. This time I was served the wrong plate. I'm allergic to onions this plate had double onions. They brought the right plate what seem like a long time.  Food was a little cold. Everyone in party loved it.< /Text>

The wait was not bad at all. 20 minute wait and they text you once they are ready for you. Other than that, the experience isn't memorable the food was not great. It wasn't horrible but it really did not taste like anything. Anything that was breaded just tasted like it was breaded no actual flavor to it. When it came to dessert, I ordered the banana cheesecake and it was frozen in the middle. Kind of dissapointed of this entire experience. The cost of the food doesn't not equal the quality at all.< /review>< gmap_id>

This place was very generous with my order. I asked for sweet potato fries and was accidentally given regular fries. The waiter said I can keep the regular fries and he asked the chefs to make me sweet potato fries to go with my regular fries. That was very kind of them.

I usually am fairly forgiving when writing reviews for restaurants, but not this time. They get two stars for a short wait for a table and food portion/taste was good. Having to wait 35 minutes for drinks and well over an hour for our food while others around us ate, got leftover boxes and paid their bill. Our server was polite, but worthless. The manager never came to speak with us but dropped a discount on our bill. That pisses me off. You know you screwed up enough to warrant a discount but not enough to personally apologize to your customers? Bad form. Once the food did arrive, the portion sizes did not disappoint and was prepared well except for the vegetables which were barely cooked. Green beans still had a snap and the asparagus was crunchy base to tip. We should've waited the 90 minutes for the restaurant we really wanted to go to.<//review>

We had a Large Party (8). They said 1:30 to 2 hour wait. 2.5 Hours later and still no Service. If Covid-19 rules apply, no parties can be seated for more than 2 Hrs. Employees at the front don't care and have a Rude Attitude. I would not recommend this Restaurant to anyone.  Wait until they figure some new method to seating customers.</Review>

Fine enough place but their menu says they have a happy hour, we specifically ordered from that menu and showed/pointed to items when ordering from this menu to the server. When the bill came we were charged the regular price and staff said they are not doing happy hour. Since they probably can’t remove that part of the menu , I highly recommend the staff at least consider telling people that they aren’t honoring that menu/prices when they take their order. Follow up call to restaurant was not at all helpful.< /Review>

There was a mix up with the lady sitting us in the wrong area and the existing waitress didn’t want to attend us because we were sat “too far”.
Ellen saw that we weren’t being attended after 45 mins of us sitting . Ellen was awesome , she went out of her way to help us with our order when she didn’t have to.
We had 4 hours of driving and were exhausted and hungry.
Thank you again Ellen !!<//Review>< Pictures>

My friend is visiting from out of town with her puppy. We called ahead to double check that the patio was dog friendly and was told that they were. The host was rude about it. We arrived to the restaurant to be told that the patio is in fact not dog friendly. I explained to them that the host I talked to on the phone said that they were. The gentleman took our name down. After waiting 20 minutes we go back to check on our wait time for the table. A new hostess tells us our table is ready but they are not dog friendly. I explained, calmly, that the first host told us they were and the second host took our names down. She said they weren’t dog friendly and there’s nothing they could do about. She was very rude about it. My friend and I left and took our business to Yard House. Please make sure all your hostesses are on the same page about the pet policy before having people (and animals) waiting 20 minutes in the hot sun.

I was told by a friend that they take their dog their all the time. Very frustrating as we would loved to as well<//text>

Build during the pandemic we need to at least go get something to eat and fortunately these just Cake Factory at Irvine Spectrum has enough outdoor seating to accommodate a good amount of people.

As for the food simply great can say anything bad about it service is always good all the staff is always doing their best and and they're still coming out with new dishes such as the Korean cauliflower which was bomb and also the chicken wontons we're to die for really really recommended</text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>My family and I normally love Cheesecake Factory.  However, my recent  experience was not so good. At 12:40pm, I placed a curbside pick-up online order with the Irvine Spectrum location, estimated for 1pm pickup. The curbside pickup was not like other restaurants, I was told to go to the restaurant and pick my food up. (Which is just normal pickup/takeout) I arrived at the restaurant, checked in with the host and waited at the pickup table for my order. There was no one specifically in charge of the online order pickups. I had to check on my order multiple times and waited 30-40 minutes past the estimated pickup time, which I thought was a quite long. This was not specific to myself: another customer nearby said she had placed an order for a cheesecake also for 1pm and had also been waiting for 40 minutes. I understand that the restaurant was busy, but most of the employees were serving the patio dining customers, putting the online orders secondary. In addition, as I received my order, I realized that there was a side Caesar salad missing, and informed a host about it. Later, an employee brought out the salad without any apologetic sentiment. The food tasted alright, but I was upset because I had waited a long time for my order, waited more for a missing salad, and not even received a "I'm sorry for the wait." I encourage Irvine Spectrum Cheesecake Factory to give the same amount of attention to online order pickups as all other customers.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1595023899486, 'text': 'Hi Lauren, we are truly sorry about the food you received and the wait you experienced.

< Review>
This is the worst Cheesecake Factory franchise I have come across in the US. Today I made an order of two cheesecakes and their sizes in general were relatively smaller than usual, but one in particular was even significantly smaller than the other. Mind you, I made a similar order two days ago and they were fine. So, when I spoke to the store, their response was that this is the "new size". Really? Because it wasn't so a couple of days ago! And I explained that it's for my husband's birthday and that I wanted to exchange it for a bigger slice ( not to even refund), but instead he told me to make a new purchase. "So much" for customer service from a well-known chain. I didn't pay $10 a slice to get a kids' slice that is smaller than the palm of hand. Even if the cakes do come sliced in advance from the company, the least the store manager could have done was to exchange it for me, but I guess the owners of the franchise don't care. See picture attached below.</Review>

The slice size is the same as always whether purchased to go or to dine in. As you can see when looking at the many flavors in our bakery case, some are taller and firmer while others are more delicate and slightly shorter in height so they appear smaller. Having said that, there is always the chance of human error and we welcome the opportunity to speak with you directly.

<review>Good! Server was really nice, didn't know much about the drink menu, and had the bartender come to offer personal drink recommendations.
We shopped while we waited ~30 minutes to get a table, and they texted us when it was ready.
Covid precautions were good. Unlimited bread is not pre-cut because of covid, if that's a deal-breaker for you.
Music was not good? Idk it was modern pop but just like, the worst selections they could find. A little more Halsey, a little less Zedd covers.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

There was a line to get cheesecakes as well and people behind us got thiers before we did ours. I know it was a weekend and the first time they opened for dine in so I might be coming back earlier in the day if I am in the area.
Also they did not want to seat us because it was over party of 4. How are you going to split up family?..</review>< Pics>

Bag salad mix was not fresh. Asked for medium well steak and was served dry well-done steak.  The meal was over $30 And the manager took off about $8 from the bill.  Only order steak from a Steakhouse. The shrimp basket with cocktail and tartar sauce was very delicious.  Plus, our server was great and helpful.< /review>

let's talk about that complimentary bread basket, that brown bread though... if I could, I'd probably go to a Cheesecake Factory and just order water and keep eating that brown bread with butter. Forget the entrees and the cheesecake. Give me bread and butter!< /review>

I used to go here all the time before the pandemic, i would always get the Louisiana chicken pasta, it’s a little spicy which is why i like it. This meal can probably feed two people, but i usually eat half at the restaurant, and the leftovers the next day. Overall great restaurant. Ps they have really good deserts.<//text>

I ordered fish tacos and it came with rice and beans but the kitchen was closed so essentially it was one of the last orders they had to make so they rushed through the food and my beans and rice came out undercook so I obviously couldn't get them refund since it was closed and they didn't refund the food even though I sent it back. So yeah.. everybody else's food was okay because it was pasta so that's why I'm not giving it a terrible review but my food was done very bad while everybody else's was just warmed up pasta.

Edit: i don't believe I will returning. A week later and I'm still bothered by it. Not even a discount on 2/3 of the food I did not eat because it was cold. No thanks.</text>

My 85 year old grandmother tried to place an order over the phone. They did not want to take the order and would not let her pay over the phone. The worker kept insisting to order online. She doesn’t have a computer and would not know how to order online even if she did.

Instead she had to call me to ask if I can pay in person when I picked up the food since she doesn’t want to leave the house cause of COVID.

The surprise dinner for my mother’s birthday now became a stress filled day trying to figure out how to get the food payed for and picked up. I’m very dissatisfied and disappointed in the customer service. I get it. It’s hard times but to put my grandmother in this kind of situation when she’s trying to order food and do a good things for her daughter is sad.

I don’t think my family will be coming back here again after years of repeated patronage.</text>

This place is always consistently amazing no matter what location you're at! The food is always top quality, and the service is the same!
And the cheesecake? Well... what do you think? They named their restaurant after that one food item! It is simply the BEST!
I tried the carrot cake for the first time here. Unbelievably delicious!
I'll be back again, and again, and again! I'm a client for life!<//Review>

I love  their Chicken Marsala and my hubs loves their Orange Chicken. The dinners are huge. I bought two dinners and it feeds  my husband, me, and my mom two meals!  Don't clean your plates America. Just eat half or one third. Your food is cheaper that way too!< /Review>

My favorite restaurant as always!! Tried the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane (Factory combination) & they are so delicious. My husband tried his usual order - Renee's special and finished all. Ordered the very cherry Ghirardelli chocolate cheesecake and it's Very Good. Ordered the Creamy Hazelnut Crunch Chocolate cheesecake and a bit too sweet and pack the 1/2 back home. Will definitely come back again soon.<//Text>

< Review>
The good: I love their shrimp garlic pasta off their skinnylicious menu. It’s unfortunate that they don’t have a full portion on the regular menu. I’d take 1k calories for that instead of the 500 and so calories. Nonetheless it forced me to stick to calorie intake.
I got a carrot cheesecake since I’ve been craving it after my wedding cake. I was disappointed since they are the Cheesecake Factory but the cheesecake was not up to par. You get chunks of carrot shreds with low cualitativo nuts. Not worth the calories. My husband got the chocolate mousse and the chicken pasta dish with speck? His cheesecake was ok. We both did get the runs after the meal. We think it was the cheesecakes? I’m definitely a fan of their shrimp and garlic pasta but I am disappointed in their cheesecake.< /Review>

I've been a fan of this place since inception.

Somehow they have managed to lower down there food quality.

Other dishes are still good, but there omelets are not as they used to be.< /Text>

Terrible experience! One of the waiter gave me a sarcastic remark when I asked him why we weren't getting the wheat bread when others were getting it...When I confronted him he just walked away. I called the manager to complain but he didn't really seem to care. Never going back to this location!</text>

Great food. Enjoyed being able to pay using their Cake Pay app on-site, even though my order was a phone in. They did forget to include one of the side items in my to-go order though. Seems for the price there should be more attention to detail.</review>

Wonderful renovated patio. Sitting at the outdoor bar means avoiding the lines. My food has always been accurate, service kind and personable. Strangely one of my favorite places to brunch too. Clearly there is no ocean view at this location but it's a great spot if you're at the Spectrum.</text>

Pasta da vinci:
I really liked the flavor of the sauce; it's a delicate creamy herby flavor that's hard to describe. The pasta itself was a bit hard and the chicken was just alright. The sauce and the mushrooms definitely carry this dish.

Bread was stale< /Text>

<review>Service was excellent.  Our party of 2 were seated almost immediately even on a busy Saturday night. Although there was a waitlist for larger parties.  We were asked if we had any allergies, which I do (to any type of onion).  The manager even came to our table to make sure nothing I ordered had any type of onion in it.  I appreciated that very much.  Our meals were excellent and of course the cheesecake was delicious.</review><Name>MD Holley< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Wait I thought I posted a review before coming here. Anyway. I'm not new to cheesecake Factory.  I might have been to at least 5 in different states. They are very consistent. I don't believe you can make any dishes wrong when health limits don't apply. Just toss all the Butter, chess, cream, sugar in.. since I'm already here, why not bring me the calorie king on this jungle of menu!</text>

<Review>Our recent visit in this restaurant was surprisingly bad. First, why are you not accepting reservation, if you already have such a limited seating? It does not make sense that people standing in front of your restaurant and waiting. On Monday night we waited 1 hour for table, then I can tell it was also limited amount of waiters. We did not spend here even 1 hour because restaurant was closing at 9, after we place finally order at 8.15, no time for cheesecake after dinner, which we mainly came for. I wish to support local businesses and keep eating out but it is really hard and paint full to do when restaurants not cooperating and understand customer needs. Food was great as always !< /Review>< gmapID>

Fast, efficient and friendly staff. I would recommend online ordering. This was my first time there and line was crazy long. While I was in line I decided to do the online order since I didn't want to stand in line in the hot sun. Food was good and the online order was faster. I ordered asada fries and Pastrami hot dog. So delish and fulfilling.</text>

< review>
Can't make reservations. I called over the phone to see if I could place one and was informed it wasn't possible. I asked if the restaurant was busy.

The hostess wouldn't give a direct answer. She said their managers have told them to not tell people calling in a answer.

She explained that it's because they go by a text message system now and they can't give us a real timeframes.

So I asked next if she could tell me if the restaurant had people in it. She said that she did see people outside dining and it look full. But went back to the whole she couldn't give me a wait time.

I completely understand timeframe for eating could of changed once I got off the phone. But what I don't understand is how un-customer friendly this is. The Spectrum can be an ordeal to pick at and for some a drive. I would like them to give customers more transparency than walking around and avoiding answers. Everyone is doing RSVPS. If they could at least honor a small section that would be appreciated. We are trying to support businesses right now and this is just making us avoid this location< /review>

Ordered some food to go, they asked me if I needed utensils when I was paying for it and also it says in the receipt UTENSILS. Picked up the food and got to our destination and no utensils, no napkins.. just the food 😒 not to mention I haven’t gone in this restaurant for a long while  coz they’re very inconsistent in the taste of their food. I had a favorite and they make it 10 different taste in 10 different location no exaggeration. I tried different locations to get the taste the I wanted, never came up. I gave up on that specific food. Now whatever  pasta I order from them it’s either too much or too little sauce. I really want to like this restaurant coz I love cheese cake so much 🤷🏻‍♀️<//review>

<text>We went here for dinner on Sunday night at the Irvine Spectrum. I ordered the chicken marsala and mushrooms over bowtie pasta. My son had the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Both meals were good. The best part of our meal was the dessert. I had the banana cream cheesecake which was great. My son had the rieces pieces peanut butter cheesecake. His was great also but a much different style. My cheesecake was light and his was very dense. Both were amazing. To start we also had an egg roll sampler which was surprisingly good. Our waitresses were excellent.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoltpzEJyLEFe45ThGewEt1cEanuOoqxps9-9f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaMkf3Q1LLI_j2rXWRdQsR4x_9Os7XkaZwcJHt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_8IZ7JezQcSLkgbu_LXz43hYMrXDggmH_yFxB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3qfulFJ6NSyysYicFVqJrawYcwZehtaTAI72N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

The food is just OK at best, but the menu is extensive. It's good for a quick bite. Also the portions are huge with uncomfortably high caloric counts. On the other hand, their cheesecakes are great!< /Text>

Our party of 5 ordered:
Buffalo Blasts
Pepperoni Flatbread
Chicken picatta
Club sandwich
Waffles
Breakfast burrito
Each entree was so fresh and tasty.
Normally when we get the Buffalo Blasts they're always very well done and oily with not too much chicken inside but at this location the Blasts were perfectly cooked and creamy inside.
Fresh bread as always.
My favorite location as far as food quality.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPspfI_jMUl17QPLpGSqi4zHthPb9tDhok3oAol=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1565542321074, 'text': "Hi Olivia, thank you for your review.

<Text>Food is normal. When I asked for no ice in my sangria, the waiter assumed that I wanted more alcohol and went on to inform me that ice won’t change the portion. He should’ve known better because I wanted hot water; I simply don’t like ice in my drinks! This assumption was so rude. If you don’t respect your job then don’t do it.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1583608478356, 'text': 'Hi Yvonne.  We are so sorry for the service you received from us.

This is a wonderful facility their food is great. The recipe is a little bit tough to read if you need glasses. So I definitely recommend that you wear some glasses so you can read the wonderful food. The service agents are great and very engaged and you can expect the wonderful meal.< /review>

We are fans of The Cheesecake Factory.  Somehow, when we ate at Spectrum location on Sept 14th, all the pasta we ordered, Shrimp with Angel Hair and Pasta Napoletana, tasted too salty.   Other dishes we ordered such as Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken, and Steak Diane are still delicious.</text>

The only reason why I am giving this place a ONE star is because the busses was kind enough to make sure I had shade in the patio. Other then that the food was HORRIBLE. My sandwhich was dry, the salad was wilted, the soda didn't have any carbonation, the set of utensil was dirty. HORRIBLE FOOD!!< /text>

<Review>This is a restaurant with a large menu.  The portions can feed two or three people, and that's why it's more expensive for their meals.  Expect to spend $50 to $100 dollars for a party of two.  It's a restaurant with tasty appetizers, great tasting dishes, and amazing cheesecakes as they should.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Depends on the day and the time, the food quality would vary accordingly. My last visit I had Louisiana chicken on angel hair pasta, the taste was great but the pasta was way over cooked, it was literally soft like babies food. I was there for lunch, however I was charged the price of dinner full size (almost 5 dollars difference I guess), which is not a big deal. The flat bread was amazing as always, but they got both dishes in at the same time, although i specified that the flat bread should come first then the main dish. Beer was somehow chilled but not cold (draft). So, when busy, don't expect much!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>My boyfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary and as introverts, we wanted to explore something new and go eat somewhere we have never been.
When we walked into this place, the first thing we saw were 5 of the waitresses on their phones gather up and none of them looked at us or offered us help.
I walked up to the counter and asked for a table and she led us to a nice table with a nice view.
Unfortunatley, the silverware and the cups were pretty messed up. Im not sure if they treated us this way because we ordered water instead of everything else she offered. They didnt even give us straws, drinking out of those cups just felt wrong. She brought us some really hard bread, I whacked the table with it and it was so hard that the bread dented. She said that was all they had but when they got more, she would bring us fresh bread. Never happened.
It took her half an hour to actually get back and take our order. I asked her for the birthday cheesecake to go and she marked it down.
Took about another half hour to get our food. Luckily we had pretzel bits we bought before actually eating.
The plates were very good looking and my pasta was great, but my boyfriends Miso Salmon wasnt great at all. We waited about an hour after eating to finally get the check, she kept avoiding us. When she came back, she asked if we wanted any dessert, I just said no because i wasnt going to wait another hour for a piece of cake.
Luckily we were at the Irvine Spectrum to shop and not expecting much from this place.</text>< pictures>

<Name>Cerulean Fish<//Name><text>In the OC this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory. Date night do Fashion Island bar for sunset n romance, but for a nice let your hair down meal? Spectrum for sure... Had a 10/10 meal here. Seated off a walk-in reasonable 5min wait. TIP *** They get very busy here, reservations recommended. We did the early dinner trick and they looked 1/3 full already on a THUR night. Barkeep came by to ask if we were thirsty, we paused to order @ the table. It was a scorching hot day so my friend and I split plate the whole meal. Avocado toast starter, mushroom n spinach on cauliflower blend crust keeps the carbs down for flat bread pizza. Mains was a cool salmon salad over more spinach, we're not kelp fans and the kitchen was very nice to sub ingredients. Generous portion for fish and avocado as well. Service was very professional but not stuffy, very helpful. Let us chat and came by frequent for tea refills, fresh plates, setups if needed. Very comfortable service, feel bad I forgot servers name, very nice guy. His/hers restrooms were convenient at the back of the room we were in. I also love the decor at this location. Price 2.5 out of 4 stars even, that's including the drinks and a split slice of very delicious cheesecake. When in Rome, right? When done here we strolled a bit through the alleys of the mall. Quite a nice afternoon.<//text></record>

<review>Shane was our server for the afternoon and he was so great. Attentive and we never had to ask for refills.
Our party of 5 ordered:
Buffalo Blasts
Pepperoni Flatbread
Chicken picatta
Club sandwich
Waffles
Breakfast burrito
Each entree was so fresh and tasty.
Normally when we get the Buffalo Blasts they're always very well done and oily with not too much chicken inside but at this location the Blasts were perfectly cooked and creamy inside.
Fresh bread as always.
My favorite location as far as food quality.< /review>< userid>

This place needs better customer service.  We waited with the pager and we waited for a long time.  We asked the front and they told us that they paged us and called our name for over 10 minutes which we never heard our named called.  They told us that we have to put our name in again and wait all over.  We have walked out.  We are never going to this location.<//Review>

First time here, all I can say is wow. So much to choose from and great service. Food is delicious and large portion. Place looks great and the employees are nice and quick. I'm pretty sure all the employees are recognized for their hardwork and attentiveness with customers but if not they sure deserve to be recognized. Keep up the great work 👍.<//Text>

First time visit to this location. The place was clean, the staff was very welcoming and nice. Our server gave us info and recommendations and did not bug us too much. She would come by just to check if everything was good but wouldn't ignore us either. The food was delicious. My friend had the shrimp gumbo and i had the skinny veggie salad. No complaints there! Any time I have to visit a restroom in a restaurant I hope for cleanliness and I hate when they arent. This place... clean! All in all... very satisfied. The only thing I, personally, am not fond of is very dim lighting. Sometimes in the dining area is understandable but the restroom was even darker than the dining area. Why?? Entirely unnecessary.</review>

Very dissatisfied with the amount of care that went into making the food. Food took forever to come out. All three of our pasta dishes felt like the pasta never even got boiled, felt like chips. The food that did get cooked properly was mediocre and most of the food was cold or lukewarm. I will say though, that the service and attention to our table was great. We did get the pastas taken off the check and were offered three free slices of cheesecake which was nice of them.<//Review>

The restaurant has very nice decor inside. Fridays to sundays are always packed and if you want to seat outside and you are in a big group, just wait a bit longer. The staff are very nice, even they are short handed when we came in, they still do their best to serve you better.
Food are tasty and their wheat bread is what really most people crave about. My only concern is to bring a bit light on every table coz most of us have a hard time reading the menu but overall we are all pleased and satisfied of the experience here.< /text>

I know this is a cheesy chain restaurant with a menu that compares to War and Peace (plus ads), but it has outdoor seating which is great for people watching. You know not to expect Michelin star dining, but it’s decent food. You’d be wise to stick to their low cal menu to avoid early onset cardiac arrest or diabetic comas. 😜I’ve always found the servers to be nice. It’s good on weekends to grab a bite or drink on the patio. Plenty of parking in the adjacent structures (free).< /text>

< Review>
Saturday night was not a good night to go.  It was a retirement party and we waited ~90 minutes for a table.  We ate on the patio, it took getting a manager to turn the over head heater on.  I ordered the "Factory Burrito". What a waste, dry rice wrapped in a giant tortilla, a few pieces of chicken, a bit of sauce and some cheese for about $17 - think it will be a long time before I waste time at another cheesecake factory.< /Review>

We ordered the following:
NASHVILLE HOT” CHICKEN NUGGETS
SPICY CHICKEN CHIPOTLE PASTA
CRUSTED CHICKEN ROMANO
Everything thing was great, I really enjoyed my crusted chicken and my wife loved her spicy chipotle pasta but our appetizer came right at the end when we were done with our entrees... Before its arrival, I told them to cancel it but I was told, it is ready now so I decided otherwise. Nuggets were nice too but they should have been on the house, anyway I did not complain and smiled and left..< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Overall experience was ok at this establishment. Reason for 3 stars is that when we requested for extra Alfredo sauce prior and post meal distribution on the side (we know, we know it’s EXTRA, we get it) we reminded the server probably 3-4 times after the meals had been served, the last time we requested she made it clear for the 4th time it’s an extra charge for the side of Alfredo sauce. Instead of insinuating that we don’t want want to pay for the extra sauce, you should just brought the darn sauce and charged it to the bill. By the time it came out we had already been done with our meals and still ended up paying for it. Not to mention we all had 1 refill, didn’t even bother asking because of the Alfredo sauce guilt.<//Review><Time>1513581003789</Time><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO47m663xFUxE2ik7ZpSD-6bpvkzGavO_5gbDy6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record>

<review>As far as Cheesecake Factory is go this one is amazing! They have a really great position in the Spectrum where you can watch the people come in and leave and you really get a lot to see. There is also a really great patio where you can relax and enjoy some drinks and if you get there before 5 you can enjoy a really great little happy hour menu. Don't forget to get a martini with some blue cheese olives as that is the bomb< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1549854201554, 'text': "Hi Jack, Thank you so much for your review.

One of our favorite cheesecake factory location but this time the service wasn't good. One of our party's meal didn't come out for 10 minutes after ours.  The bread was hard, just one  disappointment after another.< /Text>

<Review>Great location, nice outdoor patio, extensive menu with many options, something for everyone.  My meal was excellent, however the service was extremely slow the day we were there and inattentive.  It was about 90 minutes from the time we sat down until our food arrived.  Way too long, then one of the meals was wrong.  It took almost another hour before my daughter got her meal, the one she ordered... worse the server wasn't careful with our credit card.  While I was paying the bill, my husband went inside to use the restroom...on the way there he found my credit card on the ground, luckily it was him and not someone else that found it.</Review><user_name>Karyn Rubick< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

When I come to Cheesecake Factory I have to get the Louisiana chicken pasta. I get it almost every time. I just have trouble deciding on what cheesecake I’m going to get. I usually get the adam’s peanut butter cheesecake but lately I’ve really been liking the macadamia nut slice of cheesecake.<//review>

<review>Very disappointing experience. Horrible parking unless you utilize valet service. Slow service and Atrocious food. Had to return first order and wait an extended time for second order. Just as the first, the food was not prepared properly or as described. The only decent food was the bread and dessert. Was sick for 4 days after eating here. Will never, ever go back to this location  Terrible!< /review>< pics>

<Text>A quarter of my salad was way gone bad, and the lettuce and tomato on my burger was not good. The service wasn't very good, had to wait a long time to get drinks either time and the section wasn't overly busy. The burger itself was good after I chucked the tomato. And it was hot in there, I can't say I'll ever go back, and don't recommend, to me it was Dennys food, double the price.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Typical to the chain, it's large and accommodating for large parties.  This location can be loud if you're seated next to the kitchen.  There's a pretty big patio area for outdoor seating, which is by the main entrance to the spectrum from the valet parking area, so you could people watch if you cared to.  The food was what you'd expect, service is professional if a little impersonal.  Normal place.</Review><rating>4</rating>< gmap_id>

<review>Me and my wife went to dinner at 10pm on 3/12, and were immediately seated in the booth 3ft away from the busiest waiters booth, we kindly declined and were moved a few seats up.  Then we were given old cold bread that was hard as a rock, my drink which was a Sprite had a n excessive amount of ice, i took all the ice out and my drink was less than half full!!!  We both ordered the exact same dish, however they looked nothing alike, my piece of fish was easily 5x bigger than my wifes.  We were very disappointed with about every aspect of this dinner date. We will not be returning any time soon.</review>< pictures>

<Text>We love to come here for the Cheesecake and for the pasta dishes. Chicken Romano and chicken Bellagio, are two of the meals that remind me most of Europe. Breaded chicken and so much good pasta that you can share this meal with two. This location is pretty but always so busy! Wait times sometimes go to 40 min when they say it will only take 20 min. There is not enough room in the waiting area either. On another note, their drinks and desserts are super good so you can do that fast at the open sitting bar!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Long wait time for both seating and food. By the time we got our food (for 2), it felt like it had been sitting for a while since it was cold/stale. The waiter was polite and the service was okay, they even waived the price of one of our items when we commented. Better to come during off peak hours for better quality of food.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1550177442846, 'text': 'Hi Nemi, we are so sorry for the extended wait you had to endure.

Food was cold and service was really slow barterder was more worry about the crew that was getting off and making drinks that were not even on the menu he called it his speciality. And forgot about the real costumers. Some asian bartender. And few more Asian might be employess anyways service wasn't as pleasent as the one on katella on Anaheim. They have super great service and good food warm of course and cake was like the 💣  will not at all back there for sure.</Text>

Not the best.  Over-cooked steak, then  the server had order errors for our cheesecake. Not the happiest young lady at the dessert station.<//text>

Tried to make reservations for a very large party to celebrate my 50th and was told that they do not take reservations and they would not make exceptions at all.  I can tell you that the rudeness of the staff and managers that I will never step foot back into this restaurant again. They just ruined my special day and had the nerve to ask me to reschedule it for a weekday. Who does that? And they claim that they never make special accommodations when they are full of it.  I made reservations for a large party on a weekend for my birthday before but they claim that this has been their policy always.  They lie.</text>

Valerie in the bar was excellent . We grabbed a round of drinks while waiting on our table. The host Tyler was so professional and has a future in customer service and business. Other than that, the experience was horrendous, right down to the server accusing us of short changing our bill. Eventually she realized she had counted incorrectly. In the future we will go to The Cheesecake Factory at the Mission Viejo Mall.< /review>

Consistency is always a positive and CCF has been that for many,many years but with the added bonus of continually tweaking their menu,and their prices. But still good value for good grub in a pleasant upscale atmosphere. Hate to say it but good for kids.</Text>

<text>Deeply saddened after I let the hostess know we were there to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  She shared what the restaurant offers for birthdays and I selected the ice cream Sunday.  She said she would make note for our waiter so they would take care of that.  I was going to bypass the slow and rehearsed waiter, but when  we were brought the bill and no acknowledgement for my daughter's birthday,  I was disappointed.  I spoke with the hostess on our way out to let her of my disappointment.  Honestly,  in hindsight,  shouldn't she at least have offered a slice of cheesecake to go instead on a simple "I'm sorry"?< /text>< username>

I am not rating the restaurant, the food at the cheesecake factory is delicious. I am rating the service from our waitress Jessica. She was rude, had attitude and never came to check on our table. After 30-40min of her not showing up and our food not arriving,I went and asked a server if he new how long foods usually takes to arrive, he checked and Jessica came by to say she forgot to put in our order. After 30-40min a server usually comes by to give an update, she didn't. She didn't even apologized about forgetting and when I inquired more she was defensive. Was she a racist? maybe. I talked to the manager so I hope he talked to her, I will follow up.< /text>

We have always enjoyed going there but this last visit was quite the experience.  Our server was not very friendly and hardly ever checked to see if we needed anything.  But the worst part came when they brought our meals and one of the salads had a live insect in it. We never got an apology for the salad and she acted as it was no big deal<//Text>

<Text>Food was yummy, when i finally ate it....Service was very slow. I did not get my breakfast served till everyone else at the table was done eating. My order was simple basted eggs bacon pancakes... they first gave my breakfast to another person at the table. Who ordered the same thing just regular hard fried eggs. He got his order redone first but we also had to ask about where his was. ????< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I am from Seattle and had eaten at Cheesecake Factory out there and liked their food and vegetarian options. I was expecting the same level of quality when I went with family to celebrate my dad's birthday. However they did not have many vegetarian options for entrees. This was because unlike their Seattle branch all their pasta is made in chicken stock and can't be made with vegetarian stock instead. They offered to use a marinara but I was looking forward to having the same veg mushroom pasta I do in Seattle. I decided to order a veggie burger instead and that was even more sad. It had no flavour as such and the patty just fell apart and all the rice grains were seperated. They really need to look at McDonslds or Burger King in India to learn how to make a good vegetarian burger. Very very very sad.

My dad ordered a steak and he also felt the steak was really poor for the standard they make you expect. He prefers the steak he had at BJs.

The staff member was very nice and she cared a lot about our experience, sadly the kitchen couldn't back her up.

I wish they make more veg pasta options and learn how to make a veg burger.< /text>< pictures>

Jeremy was especially very friendly and nice.  Cleaniness is where they need to improve on.  Menu pages were sticky, untensil needs to be polished as it is filled with hard water spot and some were dirty.  Plastic water cup has chipped and slightly cut my lips.  Otherwise, food is average consider it's a chain.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<time>1430713213459<//time><rate>1</rate><text>The food was great. HUGE portions and great taste.

The low rating is due to the service I got from whom I believe was the manager (since he was the only one wearing a tie). After waiting for 15-20 minutes for my check, I decide to go talk with someone at the front desk. I tell this man that I'd like to pay my bill, and he condescendingly replies, "okay? where is your bill?" I told him I've been waiting for a while and didn't see my waiter to ask for a check. Then he replies, "okay, which is your table?" expecting me to have an answer as if I knew the exact table number. I gave him a direction, but of course, that isn't going to be precise. He then begrudgingly asked me to take him to where my table was.

The food may be the best in the world, but with staff like this, it would make me very uncomfortable to dine here again.<//text>< Pics>

When going to a family friendly place with lots of variety and everything being just "meh" you at least expect the food to maintain that "meh" standard. Unfortunately that wasn't the case today. Everything was overly salted, some dishes more than others, but that was the general feeling at the table. It wasn't enough to send it back but for sure enough to make it unenjoyable (in hindsight we should have sent it back). When I provided the feedback to our server his response was "yeah we get that a lot" which was a little concerning (not on the server's part he did great)<//text>

We waited 45mins for our food, when it arrived, it was cold! And to top it off our server Jocelyn was rude, and so nonchalant about the fact that the kitchen ran out of spaghetti and she forgot to let us know!! So my daughter had to wait an extra 5mins for her food. $149 and a $20 tip NOT WORTH THE MONEY...< /Text>

Service was terribly slow! We ordered 2 salads and a kid's grilled cheese and it took 50 mins!  One table by us,  came after we were seated and had their meal and paid before we're got ours!  The food was alright,  but we were afraid to order dessert,  we'd never leave.  Finally another wait person came and settled our bill.< /Text>

From their names sake their cheesecake is quite good.<//Text>< userid>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>My experience at this location has been similar to others that gave bad reviews. Love Cheesecake Factory food but service is generally poor at this location. We waited 50 minutes for our food and it never arrived. Couldn't find somebody to help us with the problem.  Our waiter took a break and nobody replaced him.  They brought out the food but it must have been sitting out for 30 minutes or more and it was not hot.  Plus an error was made with my wife's order. Instead of making a fresh order somebody decided to reheat the food. One free meal was not worth the experience.  More staff is needed and more follow-up to make sure the meal is ok when it arrives at table.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< review>
To be fair, my experience here was on a Friday evening, so I'm not surprised it was packed - I'm just disappointed in how they handled it. We were given a buzzer that went off 30 minutes after we checked in. Our table was outside, during the winter, without a heater nearby, and then it took around 15 minutes for our waiter to come by to get our drinks. She looked frazzled and was apologetic, and I don't blame her for any of the service. It seems like they overbooked the waiters. Our food took around 45 minutes to be prepared, and it took another 20 to get a dessert and the bill. All in all, what should've been a standard 45-minute experience was an hour and a half of waiting. The food itself was good, I have no complaints there, but it's obvious the staff are overworked and scrambling to get everything done. The restaurant needs to manage that better. We had to cancel our movie reservation because the dinner took so much longer than expected.< /review>

<Review>Food was great at this location! On the downside, the service was sub par. Went through 3 servers during the extent of my party’s visit. Server #1 had to take break in the middle of serving and server #2 could not keep up. When we contacted the manager, he did not seem concerned but said he would find out what was going on. He never checked back in with us.We waited at our table for 15+ minutes without any interaction after we had asked for boxes! Just boxes! Took cheesecake just as long to come out as they claimed they were “backed up”. By the way there was cheesecake in the cases and people ready to serve it. Problem is that they were serving people walking in the door rather than customers at the tables already. This was by far the worst experience I have had at any Cheesecake Factory ever!< /Review>< date>

Took them over 20 minutes to take the order. Another 30 minutes to serve the drinks, by which the ice was already melted and the sparkling no longer had bubbles. Food took nearly an hour to arrive and was only mediocre at best. And yes.. food arrive with no utensils. And they did not even realize it. We had to spend nearly 10 mins to flag them over for it. Of which they gave us nearly one of every utensil but not the spoon we needed.

There's plenty of better places to eat than to suffer terrible service at such high food prices. But they did offer a free slice of cheesecake ...

Still, definitely never coming back again.< /Text>< rate>

The amount of time it took for them to seat us was an hour long despite them saying a 30 minute wait time. Another bad thing was we sat around for about another 20 minutes just to get our drinks and finally order. I don't know what it is about this place but let's just say we went in at 6:30 P.M. and left at 10:45 P.M. once we got the bill. Just a side note, none of my family members are slow eaters either, we all got full and got everything to go. The staff is just really, really slow.</review><GmapID>0x80dce7f95c60e595:0xddb078d92dd22b63< /GmapID><user>105951776396842968080< /user><pictures>None< /pictures><name>The Shadow “The” Gamer</name></record>

Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Great for groups since there are so many options on the menu--something for everyone! Highly recommend their four cheese pasta with chicken. A little pricey, but huge portion and so tasty!!!</review>

<review>Worst management and customer service ever, who lie to your face. I was a regular customer. Placed an online order, went to pick it up and the cashier said he had "accidentally cancelled" it on his own. After waiting 25 mins they lied and refused to give me proof of receipt that they cancelled the order. After waiting 50 mins and dealing with two managers they finally issued a refund. Don't lie to customers if you mess up, it just makes it worse. You just lost a long time customer.<//review>< Response>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Worst management and customer service ever, who lie to your face. I was a regular customer. Placed an online order, went to pick it up and the cashier said he had "accidentally cancelled" it on his own. After waiting 25 mins they lied and refused to give me proof of receipt that they cancelled the order. After waiting 50 mins and dealing with two managers they finally issued a refund. Don't lie to customers if you mess up, it just makes it worse. You just lost a long time customer.< /Review>< Date>

Worst cheesecake factory experience ever. I go to cheese cake factory a lot and it was one of my favorite restaurants. On January 14 2017 we went to this restaurant and it was Saturday night around 9 pm. we waited for our table for like 20 30 minutes which is understandable because the restaurant it is in Irvine Spectrum and it is always crowded. After we waited so long they gave us the smallest table in the restaurant which was surprising but we were okay and we already waited and we were hungry so we did not want to change our table. we ordered cheese burger and chicken sandwich and we both ate 1/3 of each our foods because we had an appetizers as well too. I asked our server "RACHEL N" to bring us some boxes so we can take our foods home and she said she is going to put our food into boxes for us which was really nice of her. We paid for our foods and we took the boxes to our house, next day we opened the boxes so we can eat them and we saw it was completely different foods. We were really surprised and on Monday 16th of January I called cheesecake factory and I talked to "ANNI" who was the manager of store and when I explained everything she was like this is so strange and I have to talked with "RACHEL N" and I will call you back. She did not say sorry or any apologize in this conversation. I waited for like a week to somebody called me but nobody called me. I called the store after two weeks and I the employee said "ANNI" is in the training so I left my name and my phone number for him and I mentioned pleased tell her to call me as soon as possible. I also asked him if there is anybody else that I talk to but he said "ANNI" is the only one. Until today January 31st 2017 no one called me yet and I have not heard anything about either "ANNI" or "RACHEL". This is how they maintain their customers and how they care about their loyal customer. This is going to be my last visit to this restaurant and I will never ever going to come back to this store anymore.<//Text>

<Text>terrible service!! if you can go to literally a y other restaurant, I'd advice on doing that. It took me 3 attempt to order- the first attempt I was on hold for 5 minutes then hung, called back again and was on hold for 6 minutes  then finally I was transferred to a manager and even that was a 2 and a half minute wait. so collectively almost 15 minute to order.

I was then told itd be a 25-30 minute wait  I arrived 30 min after I finally placed the order only to find out the food was not ready (shocker!). Not only that, the staff was rude upon arriving, and the cashiers response to the additional wait time (on top of the 15 min wait to order and the 30 min wait for supposed order prep) was a shrug of her shoulders and "oh we're busy".

For an almost $60 check, I can think of literally almost any other restaurant you could go to with better service and more timely food prep time. This restaurant needs help- you cant charge people these outrageous prices for this terrible of an experience.</Text><date>1551062565338< /date></record>

<Review>Live out of town and have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories around the country. This has to be the WORST location I’ve been to. Kei (short Hispanic girl) was our waitress and she was extremely rude. I came with a party of 10 on a Thursday night. The hostess was sweet. We got a table within 15 minutes. Kei on the other hand was super rude. Didn’t get any of our orders right. We waited for two hours for our food and by the time it arrived, it was dry and cold. She forgot our appetizers and when I asked about it, she literally didn’t want to bring it. Said, “are you sure you still want it?”  I had to get out of our long table and look for her to ask for a high chair when she saw I had a little baby in my lap. It was my birthday and she came with a scoop of ice cream and had the worst attitude. I was afraid to eat it. She made the night very unpleasant. It was not busy. Everytime we asked for something, she kept walking away like she was in a hurry. My guests and I all left very unhappy. Would’ve gave a 1 star but again, the hostess was super sweet.</Review>< resp>

< review>
Fantastic cheesecake, horrible service.  We were waiting for a table for nearly two hours.  Next to where we were waiting was an empty table on the patio that was empty the whole time we were waiting.  When we finally got seated, it was at the empty table that we had been looking at the whole time.  And that was just the start of the waiting.  Since the table was at the far end of the patio, we had a heck of a time getting the wait staff to come over for refills, dessert, or to get a check.  Never again will I go to this location.  Only gets two stars because the cheesecake is so good.<//review>

< review>
terrible service!! if you can go to literally a y other restaurant, I'd advice on doing that. It took me 3 attempt to order- the first attempt I was on hold for 5 minutes then hung, called back again and was on hold for 6 minutes  then finally I was transferred to a manager and even that was a 2 and a half minute wait. so collectively almost 15 minute to order.

I was then told itd be a 25-30 minute wait  I arrived 30 min after I finally placed the order only to find out the food was not ready (shocker!). Not only that, the staff was rude upon arriving, and the cashiers response to the additional wait time (on top of the 15 min wait to order and the 30 min wait for supposed order prep) was a shrug of her shoulders and "oh we're busy".

For an almost $60 check, I can think of literally almost any other restaurant you could go to with better service and more timely food prep time. This restaurant needs help- you cant charge people these outrageous prices for this terrible of an experience.</review>

<text>Fantastic cheesecake, horrible service.  We were waiting for a table for nearly two hours.  Next to where we were waiting was an empty table on the patio that was empty the whole time we were waiting.  When we finally got seated, it was at the empty table that we had been looking at the whole time.  And that was just the start of the waiting.  Since the table was at the far end of the patio, we had a heck of a time getting the wait staff to come over for refills, dessert, or to get a check.  Never again will I go to this location.  Only gets two stars because the cheesecake is so good.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

They just finished building a brand new outdoor seating. Pasta's and of course, cheesecakes are a must try when you're here. Be sure to subscribe to their emails or google coupons before dining because the eats here are super expensive!</text>

I love the Tai coconut lime chicken. It's the most delicious thing my mouth has tasted I swear. Very disappointed they got rid of their garlic bread though. That was my favorite appetiser and there ia nothing to replace it.< /review>

<time>1546188639533</time><Review>Went for our 1st time last night. We had 2 Servers, Zach and Jeremy, and they were off the charts friendly !!! Dinner and appetizers were delicious...and our desserts were amazing. Items we ordered were: Tex Mex Eggrolls, Avocado Eggrolls, The Impossible Burger, Vegan Cobb Salad, Fettucini Alfredo, and Steak and Salmon Combo. Try their dinner salad!....I love their house vinaigrette. The atmosphere is fun. It's cool that you can see the Chefs in the kitchen...Beautiful Decor!! The place was packed, and the wait time was 30 min, but we walked around the mall so fine went by fast.  It was worth the wait ! :) p..s  I'm hoping they get one or two Organic items on the menu in the future, but at least they have the Impossible Burger which is delicious (even if you're not a Vegan)<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>I came here with a friend and we ended up waiting about 15 minutes to get a seat. The service was good and they came by several times to make sure the food was good and refill their drinks. It was very crowded but the service was extremely fast. Would recommend this to anyone who wants cheesecake along with good food. They did cut their menu back from the million items that they used to have but they still have tons of choices for cheesecake. Bon appetit</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Nah, give me Red Robin, Texas Roadhouse, anything like that. There were 3 of us, regular meals, drinks, and $150 later. Sorry Penny (anyone get that reference?), not for us.< /review>

<Text>I visited twice back in 2013. The first time I went alone and had a lunch set. The second time I went with a friend and got seated outside, it was also lunch time. I couldn't remember what we had though, maybe a Sunday brunch? It was nice.<//Text>< Pictures>

Since I am on a diet and I barely give my self cheat days I decided to get a peice of my favorite treat. I understand they were busy, but I patiently waited over 10 minutes to order. After I ordered I specifically asked for a piece of tiramisu cake, and they salesman said we have it. I said I don't want or like the cheesecake and he said I know and rolled his eyes. I paid and waited 2 minutes and he yelled tiramisu cake and handed me a bag. I was in a rush and I shouldn't have trusted him and I walked out. After I got to my destination I checked the bag and it's cheesecake. I am extremely disappointed because the employee failed to follow my specific directions and gave me what I did not want in the firstly place. I don't think I will be returning.< /Text><username>farid saffarian< /username>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My first time eating at a "nicer" restaurant , and honestly it was not worth my time or money . Server was never very polite , ordered a drink it took like 20 minutes to get to me , when we finally got our food the guy who brought it to our table was extremely rude and basically yelled at my friend to MOVE his plate so he could set the food down . There was never any attention to detail , that would make this place stand out , and I was so excited coming in .<//Review>< Pics>

My food that I ordered still hadn't arrived and it when it arrived it was incorrect!

They made an attempt to bring new food out but when they did I had to ask for silverware for my kids and myself.

Manager was not helpful and was going to charge me for my food that about 40 minutes late.

We put our name on the list and sat FOREVER! My faughter niticed all the people just coming in and being sat before us. They had lost our name from the list when I asked reason for others seating before us. They offerd no concessions, i.e. a free appetizer or a free piece of cheesecake. Only a "I'm sorry". Not sufficient. Very poor customer service in my book. Food was okay. Service was quite a bit slow and never returned to our table until we were finished. Will have to drive further out IF I decide to give a second chance and visit a Cheesecake Factory again.<//Text>

I have never had a less than excellent experience when dinning at The Factory. Considering the fact that the menu offers so much variety, it is pretty amazing that the food is consistently so excellent and comes out fast and fresh.</text>

<review>Now I never right reviews because it isn't worth my time and not to mention I have worked in the Restaurant Industry for 15 Years and in every position you can think of so I know where people are coming from when they make mistakes, but I have been to this place twice now and both times I was extremely disappointed.  I use to love The Cheesecake Factory.
First time we went there, we were told it would only be a 45 minute wait which isn't too bad on a Saturday night, but an hour and a half later without anyone even talking to us we finally said something to them.  At this point they said we were next but decided to sit 4 other parties instead and then cram us into a small table when we have a stroller with a baby.  When we asked to sit at another table they stated that we could just place her in the aisle.  First of all if you have ever been here you know that two people can barely walk down the aisle together it is so small, not to mention I am not putting my newborn baby in the aisle to have items spilled on her. Then the food comes out and everything was wrong, so we sent it back and it came out wrong again!  I really don't feel like going into the details of everything but they were simple mistakes that shouldn't have happened twice.
Second time we went here we didn't even sit down we just placed a ToGo Order.  First of all the people didn't even seem like they knew what they were doing and then the person taken the order didn't seem like she was really even listening to us.  It took forever to get the order in, she repeated it like 3 times and then when we asked about getting a couple of drinks we were told that we needed to go to the bar.  I understand that you need to repeat the order at least one time to ensure that it is exactly what the guest wants but she was asking questions every time she repeated it.  At this point we were irritated but were hungry and didn't even care, so we waited almost 30 minutes for our ToGo food and when we got home the order was all messed up!  These are simple mistakes and after repeating the order 3 times you would think that they would have checked to make sure everything was correct.  Now I know that it might have not been the server's fault, it could have been the alley coordinator or the runner who sometimes assists or other servers / managers whatever, but come on people!!!  There is a BIG difference between Fries and Sweet Potato Fries!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Too many people were there.
Variety  menus are pros but, some foods I ordered were run out and the foods were very salty.

<review>Worst dinning experience EVER! Worst customer service experience EVER! Worst lies told by a manager EVER! Worst trained personnel EVER!
Food delivered to table late and cold,
No utensils
Asked several helpers and waiters but no response (ours was nowhere to be found)
Got up to get utensils and was told to sit down.
10 minutes later utensils arrive and we start eating cold food
Manager arrives and actually starts shouting at us for disturbing the servers and making too many requests!?? Really?? Where was he trained?? Servers are meant to serve the customers, and I had food but nothing to eat it with!! For OVER 10 MINUTES!!
Anyway, was never allowed to get in a word edge wise by the manager.
After he left, and several other diners sitting near us told us how appalled they were to see us being treated that way after having had such poor service. They were shocked as much as we were and said they would never eat there again. None of them left tips since they wanted management to understand what they did was wrong.
Couldn't eat any of the $80 dinner and left feeling sick to our stomachs because of the emotional stress and embarrassment. This locations has real problems!

Update Feb 2018
Decide to try this location again.
Food was the same, 'good', and the utensils were there this time, before the food! Our server was changed before the food was brought and one of the meals was the wrong order - plate and utensils returned. This took 15 minutes to correct while everyone waited. Now we had cold food again. The correct food was brought with NO UTENSILS OR A SET MADE AVAILABLE! Asked the server TWO TIMES before a set was brought - took at least 6-7 minutes. I had asked for tea before we had ordered the food, and it arrived with the bill!
This location still has a lot to learn!</review>< Pics>

Called the restaurant they refused to tell us how long the wait is. Stupidest thing I have ever heard of. They want you to drive all the way there find parking and then find out they have a super long wait time

I said nothing about call ahead seating or reservations.

We are regulars in this place and have been for the last 3 years, but after today, I feel compelled to leave a very poor feedback. In the past, almost every visit starts with us asking for a lemon wedge so we can properly clean and disinfect the filthy, under-washed silverware. Today, in addition to that, my eggplant parmesan dish was under-cooked. It literally tasted and chewed like a hockey puck. They were re-doing it for 16 minutes. My wife was forced to eat her dish alone, and I lost my appetite completely. My wife and I were sitting in front of dirty dishes for another 11 minutes awaiting a manager. My special 26th anniversary was further destroy when Shawn Welch, the assistant general manager showed up at our table with an arrogant attitude and fake smile.<//text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Chelsea Madren (OC Food Diva)< /user_name><Date>1428362388152< /Date><Rate>4< /Rate><text>Hibachi Steak is certified Angus beef hanger steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions, and bean sprouts served with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. The steak was a great cut, but I think it would have been better served as whole with the shiitake, onion, and bean sprout mixture on top. The sauce that everything was tossed in was overpowering whole plate. It would have been better as a marinade for the steak and let it caramelize on the grill. The wasabi mashed potatoes did not quite match. This would have paired better with fish like miso-glazed salmon. The tempura asparagus were cooked perfectly with a crispy, light batter while retaining the green flavor of the asparagus. Rating: 2/5

Grilled Rib-Eye Steak is served with French fries. I think a couple of tempura onion rings snuck onto my plate as well. The ribeye was grilled to a perfect rare. The meat was beautifully marbled for a juicy, tender steak. The fries were fried perfectly with a golden brown crispy outside and tender on the inside. The tempura onion rings were fantastic! The batter was light and crispy on the outside and the onion was sweet and tender inside. Rating: 5/5

Kobe Burger is an American style Kobe beef burger topped with sautéed mushrooms and onions. I can't eat a burger without cheese so I added a slice of cheddar. One of my friends had ordered it on a prior visit and she loved it. I love Wagyu beef so I knew the next time, I had to try it. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, blending the grilled flavor on the outside and taste the sweet, buttery flavor of the meat inside. This burger was onolicious! It's one of the best burgers I've ever had. The mushrooms and onions were the perfect topping. I am glad that I went with a green salad instead of fries. This was a burger to finish in one sitting. Reheating it would not do it justice. Rating: 5/5

Chicken Madeira is sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus, melted mozzarella, mushroom Madeira sauce, and served with mashed potatoes. This is my hubby's favorite dish of all time! He has been ordering it since we started dating back in the early 1990s. The flavor is always consistent and he always orders it for dinner. The chicken was tender and soaked up the addictive Madeira sauce. The mushrooms acted like sponges and absorbed the sauce as well. The mashed potatoes were creamy and had just enough lumpy texture of potato and red potato skin. Rating: 5/5

Cappuccino is double espresso and foamy steamed milk. I'm not sure what kind of beans that they use or if I'm just used to coffee in Europe, but the espresso used was very bitter and acidic. Even with sugar, the bitter bite just hits you like a freight train. Rating: 2/5

Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough Cheesecake is creamy cheesecake loaded with chocolate chip cookie-dough and walnuts. The cheesecake was creamy and silky. The cookie-dough added a granular sugar texture and flavor. The chocolate chips can be hard as they were in the refrigerator but melt down pretty quickly on the palate. I also loved the whipped cream dollops sprinkled with even more chocolate chips. Rating: 5/5

Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple is creamy cheesecake swirled with caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. This is also my hubby's favorite cheesecake. He orders this cheesecake probably 90% of the time. It has all of his favorite flavors in it: chocolate, caramel, and peanut butter. It was very rich and decadent. He will usually take it home and will take two to three sittings to finish it. It goes great with a hot cup of coffee. Rating: 5/5< /text>< pics>

<rating>3</rating><Review>I wouldn't necessarily volunteer to go to Cheesecake Factory if I had a choice but I've come here mostly for company lunches and if there's a gift card in the picture ;)

Notable dishes/items:

Ahi Tartare
Banana Cream Cheesecake
Chicken Bellagio
Coulotte Steak
Happy Hour Items
Meatloaf

Disliked:

Chinese Chicken Salad - completely bland, and the lettuce wasn't fresh

Waitstaff are all pretty friendly though and food comes out fairly quick!

I'm just not personally a fan of the food/prices in general :)

If anything, I'd come here solely for the BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE. Yum!</Review><gmap_id>0x80dce7f95c60e595:0xddb078d92dd22b63</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm sorry to say that the "to go" order process is pretty bad.  It was so inept that you'd think that they'd never had one before.  I had to ask twice for the complimentary bread & butter.  I also had to ask for utensils and napkins and if that weren't enough they were going to let me walk out without paying so I even had to bring this to their attention as well.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) For me, this is a matter that depends on the place you visit, since the seasoning of the chefs varies ... but even so their food is acceptable and their wide variety of wines and beer contribute to having the best moments to share.
The places that I really like to visit is in the city of Anaheim (near Disneyland) and in the city of Pitch (mall)
Those two places reach 5 stars.

(Original)
Para mí gusto,esto es cuestión que depende del lugar que visites, ya que el sazón de los cocineros varía..pero aún así su comida es aceptable y su amplia variedad en vinos y cerveza contribuyen a tener el mejor de los momentos a compartir.
Los sitios que a mi en realidad me gusta visitar es en la ciudad de anaheim (cerca de Disneylandia) y en la ciudad de brea(mall)
Esos dos lugares alcanzan las 5 estrellas.< /text>
