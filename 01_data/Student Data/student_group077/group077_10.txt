They get a 5star simply because they took the time to stay open late enough on Mother's Day for the mothers who needed there nails done!<//text>

<Text>Although Paul is a bit stubborn when it comes to design & color on nails, he sure knows how to do nails.  Full set in no time, very durable too. He's an artist.  Both he and He's wife Mary cater to their customers.

I went to go get my nails done with Paul and he left my nails not even filled in certain spots ! He didn’t file them correctly and left them bumpy! Rushed through when he seen someone else was trying to get their nails done with him like no!!!! I’m paying my money for you to get it correct and not rush through my time. When I told him I wanted a certain color he said “this color is better” like no! I’m paying for what I want. And lastly, the gems he put on my nails fell off when showering. My nails didn’t even last 1week! And I paid $60 for something that didn’t last 1 week! I say you go somewhere I go up the street now and I can say I love it there and they’re very nice<//review>< Pics>

This place disserves a -5 stars. Paul never does my nails how I want them. When I tell him I want a French tip he tries to add dimonds when I tell him no. And he always has an attitude and does a horrible job when you say no to him. He always wants to do your nails how ever he wants them. And to top it all off, he is always charging you extra for things you didn't ask for.

I WARN YOU PEOPLE, IF YOU WANT TO LOSE ALL OF YOUR MONEY ON NAILS YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR GO TO THIS PLACE.😡😡😡😡😡< /review>

Wonderful! They really spend their time on both manicure and pedicure even when they're extremely busy. They offer free refreshment (including alcohol) and their prices are the same as anywhere else. They don't rush or rush you. The attention to detail isn't comparable to any other place I have been. Best mani & pedi I've ever had!< /text>

I took my daughter here to get a manicure for $10. Told the guy what we wanted and picked out her color. I went a few chairs over to get my eyebrows waxed and when I was done the man had did gel nails on her and charged $20. I did not like that at all. The lady does a good job shaping my eyebrows, but I won't be going back anymore.</Text>

My mom and I got our nails done at this establishment  because it was around the corner from my job. This place has Got to be the the worst place ever  !! Paul did my nails and I absolutely hated them. First of all the acrylic was uneven you can tell once he applied the nail color it was lumpy and even the shape was off . I tried to tell him but he said it was fine that that’s just how it was . I’ve gotten my nails done countless of times and that is NOT how it’s supposed to be!

My mom also got here nails with one of the ladies there. She told her several times that the nail was not even and keep telling my mom that it was her finger.  like no if she’s telling you its not right you have to fix it !!!

You come in because you want to feel and look cute with your nails done and getting your nails done wrong can really kill your whole mood.
Definitely would not recommend this place !
Doing nails is about art not just about the money. If I could give it a lower rating i would 🤦‍♀️< /Review>

<Text>I went in wanting a $10 white tip but the guy who did them tried pushing me into getting something different i said no i only brought $10. He then said "you want gel coat only $15"?, i said no thanks i only have $10. So he proceeded but he did a quick job not even filing them on sides nor adding oil to wash my hands. He just wiped them with a wet paper towel and did a clear topcoat fast. I can see the scratches from the nail file under the clear coat. I had to ask for a second coat because he missed a few spots but even then it didn't look any better. Now one day after, my nail broke on one end.!  I went there a few months back wanting a nicer detailed gel nails and it looks like only when you spend more money is when they take good care of you and even take a pic to post on their IG. that makes it seem like they always do a good job which is not true! Never going back. They do a quick sh**y job.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

What a horrible place to do your nails at. The guy that did my nails left them bumpy and went over the cuticles with gel top coat. Even when I kept telling him they are bumpy and the acrylic isn't supposed to touch the skin. He was like.. I'm going to fix it hold on. I don't know if they actually know what they are doing.  But after seening their ig and other reviews, I think they don't. I suggest taking your money elsewhere.< /Text>

This salon doesn't even deserve 1 star, this is not an exaggerated review either.
My first time coming here was about a year ago, I said what the heck and tried this nail salon and the lady who attended quickly sat me down and started working (which was great), and their price board said "acrylics $15", so that was the price I intended to pay. The worker handed me a book with all these designs of cool nail designs, and she told me "you choose the nail you want for acrylic nails", and I said "oh ok, only if its included in the $15 price", she said yes and I got the nail design I chose.
When she was down she tells me, I had to pay $35 and I was so confused and I told her I thought it was $15, and she said no because I chose a design but I previously asked her if it was included as a $15 job and she agreed. HUGE MISCOMMUNICATION. I was going to pay her for her job, but I wanted to express to her how upset I was because of the miscommunication. But she was upset and said, "no sorry you pay me now". I began to feel uncomfortable because she began to speak in another language to the other workers, and they all just stared at me. But I payed her and gave her the money, and left.

I return to the nail salon about a week later, from recommendation from a friend. I went with my mother, and as they did my mother's nails my mom complained that the nails were too long and the man kept telling my mom that they were a good length, but it was not what my mom wanted, and he did not respect what she wanted. As my mom and the worker began to nicker, the woman doing my nails started to put a lot of pressure on my nails and began to hurt me. I pulled my hand away from here a good 5 times, and I kept saying "Ow you're hurting me" and she wouldn't even look at me. She did a horrible job, and my mom refused to pay them and they tried to "fix" our nails, but damage was done and I hope no who ever comes here has to experience this kind of service ever.<//review>

<Review>they have the oldest/ugliest polishes so that you're forced into paying for a gel set. on top of that this place is SO EXPENSIVE. at the end you end up paying for a set that was rushed and so poorly done. my friend and i both got a set and they literally did it in less than 20 minutes. they don't even bother to clip your cuticles nor do they bother to shape your nails carefully. never going back.. they can afford a big ass ATM that charges $2 but they can't afford to have a little ass debit/credit card reader.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Today was my 2nd visit here.  I've already browsed thru her instagram before i come in and found the design i really wanted.  Sarah was very detail oriented and made sure i feel comfortable.  I went to several othe nail shops but it didnt last long.  My first one by Sarah lasted up to 1 month.  I will definately recommend her to my friends and family.  Can't wait for my 3rd visit!.  Thank you Sarah!<//review>

< review>
I' ve come to Pauls Nails since I was thirteen years old. Usually, I leave satisfied with the quality of work. However, the majority of the time its been Paul who does my nails. And today im leaving very disappointed. Maria rushed through my
( Gel manicure); she did not do a good Job at all. Every time I asked her not to do something she did the opposite of what I did not want her  to do. For starters, she used a drill to take off the Gel collr instead of wrapping my nails in aluminum  foilas they usually do at other spots. She didnt even check to see if the Nails were filed filed right; left a lot off Cuticle behind,  and left  blank color spots on my nails. when I asked her if she can fix them, she refused and said: " No because they chip"! WTH. Ive always gone to do my Gel Nails at other places  and other places. And they  do just that! My color last between 2 weeks or more. Im not a satified customer today. I would rather pay more at another spot for quality work than save a few bucks and pay $20 for poor work. 😡 Thats my fault for not waiting for  Paul.<//review>

< Review>
I’ve been doing my nails for over 5 years this is the worst my nails have been done in my life
They left chunks of the acrylic under my nails and on the sides stuck to my nails and the lady cut my real nail making me bleed Paul took off some of my skin filing my nail
So over priced for the terrible job they did</Review>

< review>
Traveled from Hollywood to get my nails done. I've been following them since 2013 on ig and I was planning to make this my new nail shop since I moved closer. I was geeked from the pic I saw on ig but my expectations were too high. I guess they take care of regulars better than first time customers.  As u can see my nails were blue and u can see the previous Polish was not taken off very well.  Sorry I won't return.  I should've just waited like i wanted to to go back to my regular place in hawthorne.  Damn i mad. My pedicure was nice though and I liked how she scrubbed and massaged my feet. Thank you .

First gave 2 stars. Gave another star for 3 cuz i went back and he cleaned up my nails..< /review>

I work here.. We offer 40's..  blunt wraps oh my favorite 1 dollar + little shot bottles. Come as you are we dont want unsatisfying customers. This is Mo Val Spot. If you see the open sign off... Sorry were closed.. We aim to please the neighborhood with smiles and a blind eye if customers want to resolve issues. Keep in mind " smile your on camera". Happy 4th of July. Yes were open too.<//text>

Very welcoming and sanitary. Equipment was cleaned before and after usage. Jodi was amazing in explaining my eye concerns and issues being detailed and attentive. Additionally the staff was great, they helped me pick new glasses and lens based on my needs. Quick with high quality. Will be going back for sure!< /Review>

<review>Dr. Jodi Shepard is my new go optometrist! Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, efficient, and uses the latest state of the art technology. She proactively shared information with me that will help my eye health over the long term, things that I did not hear from other optometrists in the past. It was clear to me she loves the work she does and truly cares for her patients. Such a great experience.< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Shepard is excellent at her profession.  Not only did she show me how significant my eye clarity can be with the latest info/equipment she had, she also gave me a fair chastisement on how my ambivalent attitude towards my high blood pressure can lead to disconcerting disabilities.   When one thinks of a heart attack or stroke, they tend to think of death, but she made me aware that high BP would most likely affect things like sight first, and a stroke isn’t necessarily fatal, but can lead you to paralysis or other issues that could take away the independence one felt they lived by.   We don’t think of going in for an eye-checkup would lead to refilling a prescription for high BP, but there you go, it did.   Thank you so much for you professional care< /Text>

Thank you for a wonderful experience. Every one was very personable and professional. Dr Jodi made me very comfortable. She gave me so much information about my diabetes and how to help get it in control. She explained the effect diabetes has on the eyes. I made me so comfortable as if we had known each other for years. Thank you for caring about your patients. She was great with my whole family.< /text>

They’re all so attentive and helpful, always going above and beyond to provide the best experience possible. What I like the most is they’re the type of people who say they will do something and ACTUALLY do it. I have never had to follow up with them because they always stick to their promises!

Dr. Shepard herself is so sweet and caring. She’s very passionate about what she does and speaks to her profession in a way that makes you appreciate the beauty of it. She’s so personable that it always feels like I’m chatting with a good friend. I recommend her and her staff a thousand times!< /Review></record>

<Review>Jodi was an expert at the craft and blew my mind with how knowledgeable she was on the subject. She perfectly conveyed everything going on with my eyes. It was such a fun experience and I feel very reassured that everything was taken care of in jodi's hands. I definitely will be coming back any time I have eye concerns or needs .<//Review><rate>5</rate><Time>1623091697914<//Time><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f9146159163f7:0x88a1d15224732aa2</gmap_id>< user_id>

I had an excellent experience with Dr. Shepard and Stacey. Dr. Shepard was so thorough and really explained everything in such great detail. She is extremely knowledgeable. I was pretty nervous at first since I have not  seen an optometrist for 3 years, but she made me feel very comfortable during the exam. My visit was extremely patient centric and very educational!< /Text>

Everything went really good and I truly appreciate Dr. Shepard taking time out to consul me on my overall health. I also appreciate Jessika on the front end counter with her professional guidance on selecting the most appropriate frames for me. The young man that ran the test was very professional as well and he clean all areas that we used righr in front of me. That really was a plus for me.
Thank you all for a wonderful experience at your place.<//Review>

Jody Shepherd was absolutely amazing. And her staff was incredible and caring. I think them for my gift of sight. No optometrist in the Bay Area is better if you quit than the office of Jody Shepherd and LensCrafter.</review>

Friendly reception. The staff explained the process of what to expect. They were professional and courteous.

The doctor was very friendly, provided great information on diagnosis and tips to maintain good eyesight.

They also have a great selection of glasses and shades.

Overall it was a great experience .<//Review>

JodI,  was very attentive, the overall exam.  I was very very impressed.

I will tell you, totally recommend LensCrafters as I will be returning
in the future.

We share land of enchantment.
She's was my neighbor from
New Mexico. 👽👽👽🌶️🌶️🌶️

First time meeting her.
Very pleasant. 👍
I believe she aims to please.

If you want customer service they got it.</review>

< Review>
Dr. Shepard and her staff at Lenscrafters are amazing! Dr. Shepard availed herself on a busy Saturday afternoon, when I was experiencing allergy eye and irritation.  She discovered that I actually had scratch on my cornea. She wrote me a prescription and asked that I schedule a follow-up appointment.  The staff is always kind and helpful.  This office exceeded my expectations.  Great job!! Thank you!!< /Review>

Very surprised how technology had advanced but the same time, I haven't been in a doctor's office for a while. Seeing everything being controlled by an IPad instead of the old Batman looking thing on my face for the eye test and combine with Dr. Shepard’s expertise made my visit more 100% sure that I made the right choice coming in. Was happy that she can promise me a 20/20 vision with the new glasses.<//review>

Stellar staff and physicians. They’re friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and thorough in providing vision care services. All social distancing protocol measures are in place and enforced. At no time did I feel unsafe or unsure -which means a lot in 2020. I am very happy with the services/products I received.</text>

<review>Outstanding professional friendly help from everyone we interacted with. My mother's bifocals broke at 10 am and was able to get an appt. the same day at 5 pm to see Dr. Shepard. Picked out a pair of frames and was able to pick up her new glasses the very next day.</review></record>

The staff was very knowledgeable of each of their performed tasks. Each staff member took the time to explain what they were going to do,which made feel at ease. Every staff member was very friendly which again made me feel relaxed and confident I would get the best care and product. By the way Lens Crafters has some state of the art equipment to get the job done in a short period of time.< /Text>

I did not feel heard by Dr. Shepard during my appointment.  There was this huge download of information from her to me and when I tried to tell her why I was there, she interrupted me and assumed to understand my issue, and explained why I just didn't know how to wear my glasses, while never truly listening to my need or struggle.  She jumped to conclusions multiple times throughout the visit.  At the end, She began to write a new prescription for more progressives, I had to stop her and say NO I want single vision reader glasses, and single vision driving glasses.  She only gave me a script for readers, she assumed she understood how I would be using them and determined the distance I needed them, without ever consulting me and how I read, work and do needlework.    She told me to use my current progressives to drive because that is HER preference for driving.

I am now afraid to get my prescription filled, I have no assurance that it is what I need.

This is the second visit I have had with Dr. Shepard, the first visit I had the same exact experience and have a very expensive pair of glasses I will never use.

My husband & I will not be returning to Lenscrafters and Dr Shepard at the Southland Mall.  We will be looking for another provider.</Text>

Dr. Shivani was very knowledagble, and took the time to extensively explain all relevant aspects relating to my optic health. I appreciated her kindness and patience, and how personalized she made the experience. I was greeted very warmly by staff. I have been going to the Hayward Lenscrafter location for over 10 years, and will continue to do so.<//Review>

Our staff strives to provide all of our valued patients with top-quality care, and it's wonderful to hear that your experience at  Southland Mall Eyexam of CA was pleasant overall. We look forward to seeing you again for your annual eye exam!"}< /response>
<text>It has literally been years since I've had an eye exam, so needless to say I was a little nervous making an appointment. I was able to get an appointment within 5 days of scheduling!  This was my first time going to the Lenscrafters at the Southland Mall. The staff at  the desk were friendly and welcoming. They were very thorough with their paperwork and got me in to do my exam withing a few minutes. I felt very comfortable with the woman that did my exam. After a few test and notes I was walked to a room to wait for Dr. Monica Liou. Right away I could tell that she was very passionate about her work and took time explaining to me how my insurance benefits worked. After a few minutes talking with her she let me know that I still had very strong vision and wouldn't need glasses. She informed me how often I should return for my next exam. Dr. Monica Liou was very kind and took the time to ask me if I had any other questions. This establishment is top notch and I am definitely returning and referring!< /text><date>1483939917725< /date></record>

I had the great experience here. I sold my gold coin MS62 liberty and MS63 liberty to the owner, Mark.
Mark is a honest, kind business man. I felt very comfortable to do business with Mark. He gave me the best price in town and he also provided an outstanding customer service. I would do business with coin exchange again.< /text>

Super nice people and beyond cool.  This is what the store is like.... Imagine you’re  a kid and you love to collect coins, dinosaur fossils and meteorites.  Then you grow up and have a cool store and love talking to people about what they collected as kids.  That’s the vibe here. Just great people all around.  Really good jewelers as well.  Support them, buy/sell with them.  Cheers, Mark</Text>

Absolutely wonderful experience! Both of the owners were so kind, welcoming and professional and provided an honest opinion about my coins. I would highly recommend this shop to anyone who is new to learning about coins or wants to get fair value for their coins. I can't speak highly enough of both owners</review>

I went in with a few  items, coins, etc., and as Mike was going through the items he came across a broken ID bracelet that had belonged to my son. He asked me who Jesse was. I explained that it was my son and that he'd passed away in November of 2018. I told him the bracelet was broken, his name illegible and I couldn't wear it. (I'm crying while writing this) He said, "I'm going to fix this for you, so you can wear it and always have him with you. It will look like new, and I will not charge you." I began to cry and I gave him a huge hug. When the bracelet was ready, it was perfect, and I've not removed it since the day I picked it up. I will always be grateful for his kindness.< /review>< Pictures>

Still can't get over how friendly and helpful everybody was.  They took the time to carefully look through everything and explain why there was/was not value.  They gave me good recommendations for what to do with the items they wouldn't take which was very much appreciated.  Highly recommend!!<//Review>

<review>Unfortunately there's no parking on the street available because there's a gym across the street. Expect to drive around and try to find a spot.

Came here to get some coins looked at, unfortunately they turned out to only be worth their face value, but the owner is very friendly & professional.< /review>

After a different place told me they would give me about $40 for some old coins i was selling, i went here and am glad i did. They gave me $350 for the coins- based on their silver content alone and i could not be happier! Best place around for this type of thing. And yes, they really do offer you change for the parking meters outside and a cold bottle of water. Even if youre just there browsing.</Text>

Delightful. I went a couple years ago with my mom to exchange some euros, and they were very pleasant, they gave us cold water bottles while we were there, and they even offered her change for the meter outside! I just went with some middle eastern money, they couldn't exchange it, so they gave me a card to another place. They mostly do euros, pesos, and south american currency, but very pleasant nonetheless!< /Text>

<Date>1456445715832</Date><Text>I needed more of them plastic single coin holders for a few coins I have had for collection, and decided to go to a different place.  During the time here at Coin Exchange, they were fixing up their front door. Forgetting to bring any change for the meter (already 10 minutes green), I kinda hurried in.  I asked if they had coin holders, without hesitation, they gave 20 free. With sincerity, I accepted it. 👍</Text>< Name>

Very fair! Great experience every time! Friendly & knowledgeable staff, great service, fair prices, & great place to buy and sell rare coins and bullion at fair price. not much rare inventory on display that I could see, but they have a large inventory  available upon request!  Ive been to coin shops all over the world, and this is one of the best around, feel free to call around and get bullion quotes they beat them all by far, ive been buying and sellng here for years!

<text>I just got back from A Coin Exchange.  Let me tell you this, being a Nurse I pride myself on customer service. I was blown away on how I was treated. I forgot to put money in the parking meter and they gave me a quarter (thanx for that).  I went in looking for Mercury dimes for my wedding and found them purchsed 13 and an extra one was given to my daughter and a steel penny. I was mesmorized on how knowledgeable and courteous everyone was. I will be back with my wife a few things caught my eye.  People tend to lose sight of what's important, the relationship between the seller and the customer, but not here very very welcoming.  C u guys soon. Thanx. you guys saved me.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

You walk in the door and the first thing they ask you after a polite greeting is whether or not you have money in the parking meter. If not they have a bucket of coins in which you can grab the amount of change you need to put in the meter for the duration of your visit. Then they set a timer to keep you aware of how much time is left on the parking meter. During my visit one of the employees went out and put more change in my meter to ensure I don't get a ticket. They offered water, snacks, and honesty that I have not seen at almost any other business.
Out of many of the coin shops in the valley they had absolutely the best prices, and even rounded down to give me a slight discount on their already discounted prices. I went to another coin dealer
(somewhere on Sepulveda), and they wanted $500 more for the very same item that I got at A Coin Exchange. A Coin Exchange isn't trying to make the most amount of money from each person to stay in business, they use the volume of customers that consistently return. For anybody either wanting to buy or sell precious metals, go to A Coin Exchange<//Text>

Going to place that you've never visited can be a bit un-nerving but at least having a referral is a little bit of comfort but still the "not-knowing" what to expect fear still lingers. All of that went away as soon as I walked into this place. I was greeted by Pam and soon after was introduced to Jonathan. These are some of the nicest people you could ever want to meet or do business with. Jonathan was so gracious and easy going and carefully went through each and every item I brought to make sure he was giving me the best prices available and Pam was showing me diamonds and custom rings sets that she can create. It was truly a very comfortable transaction and would definitely recommend this place to any and all that would listen. I plan to use Pam for a custom engagement ring in the near future and ANY jewelry or coin business that I may have in the future is coming here. What an absolute joy considering I am the most pesimistic man on the planet!</review>

Dr. Bruce has been my Dentist for more than 10 years. Her and her staff are "EXCELLENT". A warm welcoming caring energy throughout the office. I can feel the passion from Dr. Bruce and the smiling dentist team hearts from the moment I enter the receptionist desk, sitting in the dental chair having work performed to when I exit the office. I feel prioritized as I'm sure all of Dr. Bruce's patients experience that same feeling. My pearly whites when I smile will blind you lol. I thank Dr. Bruce and the smiling dentist team for a healthy mouth. :)< /Text>

Dr. Bruce and team are always very professional and promotes a safe environment in the office. Dr. Bruce is very good about keeping the appointments on time and also being very detailed and thorough with the work that is being done.  I can honestly say that I am always very satisfied after my visits. I also appreciate the courteous, patient and knowledgeable assistant who went above and beyond to help resolve my scheduling conflict and took time to answer my questions.</Text>

I’ve been going to this practice since I was a child. 23 years and counting. My experience has always been a pleasure. Dr. Bruce is amazing. As a private practice, they’re very nurturing and very personal with their clients vs. HMO. Even after moving from the area, I still go here because they take care of their clients well.<//Text>

Dr. Bruce is excellent and is my regular dentist.  I just met Dr Parker and Linda.  They are excellent also. They are very professional, concerned and truly care.  I’m so glad they have a new dental hygienist.  After a terrible experience, which left me with very few options, they supported my decision and worked accordingly.  I was so scared but their confidence was impressionable.  They are a great team.  Thank you ladies!<//text>

The staff and Dr. Bruce are very nice and welcoming.
Dr. Bruce is very detail and sincerely concerned about your health and teeth.   The office is very clean and sanitized.

Dr. Bruce also applied vaseline on my lips so they are not dry during her servicing. That’s is so thoughtful and a very nice personal touch.

I am very pleased with her services and will be referring my family.

Thank you

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I found Dr. Bruce through a recommendation. I’m always very anxious going into the dentist but all of the Dentists, dental assistants, techs, and receptionists  are so friendly and welcoming. Dr. Bruce takes her time to explain what she’s about to do, what the machine she’s using does, it’s it going to hurt, etc. for someone like me who cried as soon as you touch my teeth, this is very helpful and verily calming.

So very happy to have found this office I recommended it to everyone I know looking for  dental work.

This is the best dentist in the area but I’m pretty sure the  whole city! I’ve never looked for another one due to how satisfied I always am with the work. Dr. Bruce will update you on what you need immediately and in the future, she’ll accommodate your needs as well ensuring that you can be comfortable in your experience as well as payments (major!). All the other dentists/assistants are skilled and friendly - it makes going to the dentist a memorable and painless trip. 5 stars ONLY and highly recommended! Get your teeth spruced up or “Bruce’d” up. The Smiling Dentist is the best!!!</review>

I really enjoyed my first visit to Dr. Bruce's office. I felt like more than a number, and for someone who's had some pretty traumatic dental encounters, I felt good about choosing Dr. Bruce. The office is inviting and welcoming. The staff are considerate and helpful. I look forward to continuing to see Dr. Bruce for all my dental needs.<//review>

I was warmly greeted, friendly and professionally treated throughout my
exam. Dr. Bruce took the time to educate, demonstrate and plan the course helping to
improve my dental health.This was the first time my anxiety was unfounded. Dr. Bruce and her staff are the best, hands down ten 🌟's family dental practice ever!!!. No wonder everyone had a smile on their face and so did I. I will recommend to my family, friends and church members. Thank you Dr. Bruce and staff.< /review>

I've been going to Dr. Bruce for decades (literally).  Her staff is always very friendly and she makes every visit very comfortable.  My last visit was with the dental hygienist, who was very timely and efficient.  In my experience, the dental hygienists have given very forward and effective suggestions, which have yielded positive outcomes for maintaining oral health.<//Text>

Dr Bruce is a great dentist but I felt ripped off with all those damn deep cleanings.  My teeth are not in bad shape but that hygienist is ripping people off.  That was really annoying but Dr Bruce does excellent work.

I initially came in to get the amalgam taken out and replaced with resin but it never happened because that woman would constantly tell me about cleanings.  One time I was went in for a filling and the hygenist got me in her chair before doctor Bruce.

I stopped going and found someone else that does great work and doesn’t have a hygienist on site.  😀<//Review>

My aunt was going to Dr. Bruce's office.
Dr. Bruce uses her dental hygienist Sonia to lie about the need of having a deep cleaning when you only need a regular cleaning. While she lies about the deep cleaning she explains that you need a laser treatment so that they will charge you more out of pocket. Since she had to pay out of pocket she decided not to get it. She later when to another dentist which said she didn't need a deep cleaning nor a laser treatment just a regular cleaning. Dr. Bruce lies about treatments and uses her staff to lie for her about treatments.</Text>

<Review>I was in a motorcycle accident and broke a lot of my two front teeth (cue The Chipmunks, All I Want for Christmas Are My Two Front Teeth). The staff at Dr. Bruce’s Office took care of me, and fixed me right up. When the dentist was done, she has completely restored my look and no one would ever be able to tell that less than 12 hours earlier I was in really bad shape. So satisfied and happy with the work!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<time>1487187634156<//time><Review>Ive been a customer of Dr Bruces since 2011.
Dr Bruce and her staff make dentistry as pleasant an experience as you can have considering no one enjoys the procedures.  I have had several crowns made and placed here and the work is top notch.

This office has invested in high tech equipment and they have a Cerac crown making machine and 3d scanning system they use so they can create crown out of high tech ceramic on site and rarely need to make an actual physical mold anymore.

They have been upfront and straightforward with me every visit.
The only issues I have are with my own dental insurance seemingly randomly covering this or that, but the office has always been very straightforward.

The whole office is caring good people that I wholly recommend.<//Review><Name>Dave Sampson<//Name>< resp>

A few months ago I went somewhere to get my hair cut for the first time in many years. Well it turned out not so good. I finally decided to get it fixed. I looked on google, and found this awesome place right down the street frim my house. i work for the movie industry so I am very paranoid about going anywhere during these times of COVID 19. This place has their doors locked, you wait outside, they sanitize the stations before they let you in. Everyone is wearing masks, and the place was clean. My stylist was Sydney and she was amazing. I told her what I want and she was not shy, she went to work, and gave me exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely come back to this place, and recommend it to everyone. Very happy.</text>

< Review>
Just got my first haircut since Covid-19. Heidi gave me an expert cut, exactly what I asked for. Fair prices, very clean, and goes strictly by all the guidelines so it is very safe. One other customer was there, got a color "correction", went from sketchy do-it-yourself orange, to looking like a super model.<//Review>

I was in the area and I searched near by Salon’s, the reviews convinced me to go in. I just went for a trim and I’m so happy I went in. My hair stylist was gentle with washing my hair and cutting it. I would definitely go back for my next trim :)< /review>

It’s two toned naturally as I’m Norwegian and Swedish - I only trust Heidi with coordinating the color at the appropriate time and as she suggests, use the Malibu treatment a few times a year. Never once was I told to do something with my hair that would be considered not cost effective for me! I have great respect for Heidi and her team! They practice with high integrity , professionalism and there chair side manner is exceptional! I highly recommend West Coast Cuts if you are looking for the best without breaking your bank account!

< Review>
Heidi And her team are the best. My hair was damaged and brittle for a long time. When I started going to Heidi I saw a big difference and my hair was healthy again. I have been going to Heidi for about 12 years now and I recommend everyone to go to west coast cuts and colors and ask for Heidi you will not regret it. I have never been happier with my results as I am now!< /Review>

I have been going here for some time now and the girls are so pleasant. I have difficult requests for my hair as I have two, different, separate colors in my hair (yes on purpose) that require bleaching and coloring. I also have really long hair and get cuts and bang trims often and have never left upset with those outcomes. They always get it right. If I do have a tiny issue or I am not 100% satisfied with my hair, they ALWAYS fix it until I am happy and that is something I most definitely appreciate. The time, effort and patience with me and my craziness. Thanks West Coast!

<Text>I have been having my hair cut by Heidi at West Coast Cuts & Colors for about the last four years.  If she is not there, I will come back another time because I know she knows what I like and does everything she can to make me a happy customer.  Although I know that others may do the same, why chance it when you're happy with a single service provider (of any type), right?

As a guy, I go for the simple wash & cut deal (no desire for coloring, streaking, perms or any of that stuff).  One of the great things is that Heidi knows that I am the type that washes his hair every single day; there's no need to wash my hair before cutting it because it has only been a few hours since the last wash anyway.  Rather than not giving me the wash that is included in the package, she is really nice about washing my hair after the cut.  After all, why should I have all of the little pieces of loose hair falling onto my desk when I go back to work, or even worse, into my food when I have my lunch?

Heidi is always super personable and remembers who you are as a person, not just as a customer.  She makes it a point to ask about things and have real, meaningful, conversations with you while in the chair.  There are some places that you'll go and wish that the stylist would just stop talking because all they do is talk about their own drama but Heidi talks with you as a friend would.  She's also a dog-lover and has two beautiful Miniature Pinschers that we converse about since I have one as well.

I cannot say enough good things about Heidi and the job she does; the prices are reasonable, the cut is always correct (she tracks how to cut your hair within your customer record in the computer), and she treats you right.

What more can you ask for, right?<//Text>< Pics>

<text>I entered in this place with not very high hopes but I was in desperate need of a new cut and the  place was near the place where I do my international produce shopping so I said it's worth a try.
I always ask for a long bob showing the picture of what I want and almost always leave with something different. This is the 1st time in L.A. when I had somebody done it  exactly as in the picture and I assure you I payed much more in some other places.
This is the 2nd best haircut I  got  in my entire life ( Thank you Sidney). I was very-very afraid that I am not going to like it, that it's not going to sit as expected because Sidney used another tehnique to cut the ends, not as the one used in  my best haircut and I was literaly thinking that I would  look like "usual" when I ask for a long bob. I have very thin hair and is hard to give it volume if you are used to cut other types of hair.
Sidney  did a great job, it really stays as I wanted to, even without produce in it after wash.
Check this place out,  I bet the other hairdressers are as good as she.< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>Heidi @ West Coast Cuts has been taking care of my hair styling for about 5 years now. My hair is cut in a layered style because it's thin and otherwise hangs straight as a pencil. A few weeks ago, Heidi and I decided to cut it just a tad shorter than usual but to retain the cut. I've delighted with the "new" old look and think going to West Coast Cuts is a real bargain.<//review>< Resp>

< review>
I usually have good experiences here, but not today. I had someone who was new to me. (I didn't get her name but she is tall with silver hair.) It started with her asking people behind me in line if they were ready to go. After they pointed out that I was next, I indirectly suggested she look at the sign-in sheet after which, without apologizing, she took me next.

The result of my haircut was disappointing. When she was done she asked if everything was OK. I didn't know where to begin so I started by pointing out an area that was still too long. She really didn't do a very good job of correcting it so I just gave up and decided to leave with a slightly longer cut than I wanted, an out of balance haircut, and most startling, hair that was not even combed and looked like I had just come out of a wind storm.</review>

<Review>Great company. They removed some collections from my file. After about one month of them working on my case, I was able to go and finance the car I wanted without a problem, my credit was excellent I believe  769 with Equifax  (it was 485 when they started working on it).  I will recommend 30 Day Credit Repair to anyone I know who has credit issues.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb772d97535fb:0x7fe954e602f89bdf< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was in a tough spot financially (raising capital issues along with accounts receivable problems). I went to multiple law firms and 30 Day Credit Repair(not law firm but better) was the easiest to work with. I am very happy i found them as I now got my funding and they helped me track down the debtors that took off to another state without paying me!! Angel is Amazing! He is an all around financial super pro! He was able to make my file a success when other law firms said they couldn't.  I truly felt like he had me and my family in his best interest. Angel was quick and very knowledgeable about helping us with our issues. Lowest prices in town! Thank goodness I am on your team!< /text>

Without this help I could not get out of debt and I was really scared. They knocked out the debt and their fee is very reasonable. They took care of everything<//review>< date>

Great company to work with. Don't listen to the toxic people who knock on credit repair. This service varies depending on different factors, but the matter of fact is that there are many people who's scores have increased compared to those that haven't. The company is more than happy to work with you to solve a problem you might have. They built my credit score with a couple tradelines and I am sitting on the hills now. Gracias Angel</review>

I was approved for Business Funding recently Funding was provided by a company referred by 30 Day Credit Repair. Dont think it would have happened if it wasn't for Angel's guidance. Thanks again for all your help and spot on advice. Will continue to refer my network of tire franchisees 👍< /review>

<time>1591216469491<//time><text>This is a scam! They charged me $350 Then told me I needed to sign up for a random account that was $1 a day on top of $10 a month. They hang up the phone on you no matter how polite you are. They have no communication with their customers or the process if you have any questions. They just take you money and run. Be afraid of all these fake reviews. They are not real! you will be scammed. Even with signed a very specific contract.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>From my first appointment with this company, they were up front about everything that they could and couldn't help me with. My consultant Angel answered all of my questions, and his advice helped me with making better decisions with my credit. I've been with this company since June so far so good  and I just wanted to be in a position where I wasn't getting turned down for anything anymore! Thank you for everything 30 Day Credit Repair! If you really want to get on track with your credit and financially, give these guys a shot</text>< userid>

<review>These guys can make it happen. As a real estate agent, it's necessary my clients have at least descent credit and for those that don't, I have them speak with Angel and his staff; there hasn't been a single client I sent their way, that didn't come back to me with an improved credit standing.<//review>< pictures>

My credit score jumped significantly within 7 days after working with 30 Day Credit Repair in the pick. the best thing about this company is everyone is so much friendly, honest, helpful, did not promise anything outrageous. I went to 30 Day Credit Repair in Riverside and  they fixed my credit in 7 days and now I have a 600 credit score. I highly recommend this place.< /review>

<review>When i called this place the guy who answered was rude and unprofessional. He was arrogant and made sure I knew he had no intention on helping me. he gave me a quick run down of how they worked but then said "we're not taking in new clients.....umm NOPE we're just to busy right now" and hung up. I don't doubt all their reviews are bought now just like another reviewer mentioned.<//review>< Pictures>

First off they cancelled my first appointment while I was en route. This was my first encounter. Then I called back to reschuled. I was in the office for less than 5 minutes. The lady who came to get us introduced herself and took is thru a maze a in the building to a tiny office where we sat down to Speak to a guy who never introduced his self. He asked how he could help. I explains I would like to know show his program worked he waited 2 seconds and asked the same question.  So I asked the same question again then he give a brief description of what they are suppose to do and tell what he needs to he started. I talked to this company 2 or three times over the phone they never explained what you need when u come in.  Just a complete waist of time on top of the the guy was rude.< /review>

Green quiet clean. Bathrooms. Always some street people. They keep to themselves but I would suggest an escort to the bathrooms.
Decent for a dog run. Busy road close.
Hoping for a jazz festival this summer.</review>

<Review>Beautiful, peaceful,  mostly empty at noon early in April.  Would be a great place for a picnic.  Please pick up after yourself unlike one slob who left all his fast food trash behind.
The flowers and rose garden are beautiful.</Review>< user>

<Date>1621108725568</Date><Review>Beautiful...but....it's a campground for the homeless during the day. I frequent the beach very close and use the bathroom. The a bathrooms are used by the homeless for their drug injections. Everyone I speak to of this know it are as a homeless drug trade location.  So sad that the CBad police can't remove the homeless because of our lovely political situation in Socal and the CBad City Council.</Review>< pics>

Magee park has its pros and cons. Cons, lots of sketchy people hanging around there, people are not cleaning up after their pets. Pros, great place to kick the ball around, throw frisbee has lots of field space.</review>

This is a great little city park, unfortunately there is a major homeless person problem here. They make a mess in the bathrooms, and I have seen countless needles from drug use laying around. Other than that, it is beautiful.< /review>

It was just about 6pm. I heard the sound of a trumpet. The flag lowering was taking place next door at  The Army and Navy Academy..
Brought back memories..
Enjoyable moment to salute our flag.</text>

<text>Nice little area if local history!  Don't sit on the furniture in the Magee house!!!!  Thought i was going to be hung.  I was the last one to walk in the door on a school field trip and missed the part where they told our group not to touch a thing!  Wow!!  Should be a big sign in yhe main room upon entrance that says dont touch or sit ob anything!</text>< user_name>

It's basically a small grassy area and a typical Park bathroom. Carlsbad alkaline water is across the street and that place is wonderful.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The area is nice the maintenance is very good (clean areas)

<review>We ordered a latte with honey lavender syrup and a pour over of a light roast.

The latte was tasty with a light, floral sweetness.

The pour over was delicious! I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the bag of coffee so I could remember what it was. It did end up being a "specialty pour over" which I did not realize when I placed the order, so make sure you know what you are asking for.

In summary, go here for good coffee.</review>< pics>

<Text>I’ve tried this coffee house about 5 times now. I have ordered something different every time hoping find something I like but I have hated every single cup of coffee I have gotten here. I tried to pass off my coffee to my husband but he hated them all too. The coffee is very bitter and has a strong fruity taste. Their bags of coffee beans list the ingredients and it looks like some of the coffee has blackberries, lemongrass or bell peppers. I have tried to get recommendations from the associates for a smooth (no fruit) latte but the don’t seem to be very knowledgeable about the coffee. It’s a shame because I walk past this coffeehouse on my way to the beach.<//Text>< Pics>

This was some of the smoothest espresso I've had in a long time.  Would have given them five stars but the wait was fairly long for not being very busy.  Also they had a strange picture of John the Baptist with dreadlocks.  No need to be sacrilegious.

Cont...

Thanks for the reply.  Dreadlocks are associated with a lifestyle that is directly in contrast with John's teaching.  Remember, John the Baptist was one of the most righteous men to ever walk the Earth.  Having even an appearance of evil is sin, and since the rastafarian lifestyle is filled with acts contrary to the Bible, I doubt John would appreciate being associated with such.

Additionally, the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 11:14 that it is a shame unto a man to have long hair.  So, intentions aside, the art is sacrilegious.

Perhaps the artist would like to depict a similar picture of Mohammed?  I'm pretty sure he ate honey as well.< /Review>

The picture of John the Baptist is not intended to be sacrilegious in any way.  It was a gift from a local artist and an inspiration in the naming of the business (John ate wild honey from bees as part of his diet).  Thank you for the comment and visit.'}</Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
We keep trying to get an excellent coffee when we visit my family- when we saw Red Bee had Klatch coffee, we figured they must know what they were doing and we weren’t disappointed. They could have a safer system for physical distancing,  but the coffee was amazing. With little effort- they could make it feel safer AND serve amazing coffee. If they tighten up the physical distancing would like to try some of their food. It looks good.<//Review>

<Review>I went to Grover beach for the first time ever this weekend to visit my bf and found this adorable spot within walking distance from his house. EVERY THING is amazing, local and fresh (the pasteries are to die for and made in house from mom, who runs the food side)

Needless to say myself, the bf and dog walked there not only 2 times but 3 in my 2 day stay and enjoyed the outside seating every time.

I enjoyed quad espresso, soy cortado with add shot and a soy iced orange mocha (seasonal) all were AMAZING. He had an iced caramel late and a hot caramel late both with almond milk. For food we had the ginger cookie (2 times, 1000% reccomend) and the veggo frittata (again, reccomend)

Noni was AMAZING, as well as the manager of the coffee side. I enjoyed everything from the ambiance, food, coffee and conversations. I really can't wait to return!!!</Review><resp>None<//resp><user_name>Dominique Paiva<//user_name><UserId.>112782907139117725330</UserId.>< time>

Great place to hang out, work, and get a great coffee. The have paninis that range from $6-7 that are delicious. The portions are small, but the quality and flavor are high. And then they have muffins, pastries, lemon bars, energy bites and more. I'm there often for a snack, latte, and quiet place to work. The staff is extremely friendly. They know a lot of their customers by name and order, are always smiling, greet you on your way in and say bye on your way out. It's a lovely local coffee shop.<//Review>

<date>1523812566695</date><rate>5</rate><review>We passed by this place yesterday while going to Oceano Dunes State Beach. We made it there this morning and was greeted as we came through the door. The staff was family oriented and after asking, we were told they've been here for a year and the business belongs to the daughter in law and husband. The dirty chai was excellent and I recommend ordering it "for here" so you can enjoy the large mug it comes in. The interior decor is rustic, warming and inviting. An updated cash register iPad takes payment and accepts tips. Sign with your finger and enjoy your beverages and paninis!</review>< Pictures>

<username>Scott Potter</username><text>Exceptional!  I got the house drip coffee and my wife got a cappuccino. The drip coffee was exceptional and like an Americano. My wife said be cappuccino was wonderful. There are actually very few real coffee shops Andy Grover Beach Arroyo Grande area so this is now at the top of my list have places to go get a serious cup of coffee. I love real coffee shops that are not Starbucks!  If you are anywhere near Grand Avenue and you're searching for good coffee don't even hesitate to drive down to this end of town it's totally worth it. I can't speak for the pastries and desserts but they looked great in the case. I did hear that they are all homemade there.</text></record></dataset><record>

The best coffee in the area.  The pour-over coffee is the ticket.  Perfection!< /Text>

Probably the highlight of my memorial weekend here. They KNOW how to brew their coffee and it doesn't taste burnt or too sugary like Starbucks. I will be coming back here to try all their other drinks when I'm in town again!

Staff is also so friendly and knows exactly what they're talking about when you ask them about the espresso and more.

Get the white chocolate blended coffee. It's amazing and looks great!!!!! GO HERE NOT STARBUCKS</Text>

We came here to have a cup of coffee and wait for our friends on an ATV excursion. I love the wonderful home style restaurant. The crew here are all family and very friendly to everyone. And, they make great drinks and very cheap prices compared to the national chain. All their desserts are hand made fresh and you can taste it. Our favorite was their lemon bars which they make with fresh lemon from their lemon tree.< /text>

However, it is not discrimination, it is not stealing, and it has nothing to do with homeless people. The car wash across the street has a change machine that very often does not work. We are not a change machine and we are not able to keep up with the demands for change due to the car wash’s broken machine. I understand that people can be upset. One person was irate that I did not give him a whole roll of quarters! I am sorry for your inconvenience and I hope that the rest of your journey is a happy one.\n\nCrosby — Owner'}</Resp>

<Name>John Quesada< /Name>< Review>
I’m in town for days off from my traveling job as an entertainer coach driver. Walking around the area, enjoying the beach and town. Tired of walking, I decided to catch a bus back to my hotel. I went into Red Bee to make change for the bus and they refused me and said I needed to purchase something first. Although I make six figures, they could’ve just made change from the tip jar. I left feeling like I had been discriminated against and treated like I was just some bum off the street. I needed the change so I bought a piece of zucchini bread. However, this type of move is total discrimination against the poor and homeless, pure and simple, it’s an old trick and it’s wrong. What if all I had was $10 to my name and I was trying to catch a bus for a job interview or the like. Now, I’m out $3 just to get $1.50 in change for the bus. It’s stealing, period. Screw this business owner.< /Review>

Crosby the owner knows coffee like nobody i know; best coffee around for sure.. this place also has solid gift of hospitality. Owners have lived all around the world and have been working coffee shops for ages and crazy passionate about doing coffee well.. so they set the bar at a super high standard wise; you will see. They also really gets espresso drinks in regards to quality. They also use Klatch coffee which I guess won the World espresso competition in 2014. You won't be disappointed!!<//review>

Wow! One of my new favorite coffee shops!! An absolutely delicious cappuccino and all the baked goods were clearly homemade and delicious. It's got great atmosphere made better by very friendly staff/owners. They knew so many peoples names and orders who walked in and they've only been open four months. Very impressed, will return!< /review>

What an awesome little coffee shop. The service was really friendly and attentive, showing a genuine interest in who we were.

The breakfast Panini and the flourless chocolate cake a a must and go really well with the exceptional coffee.

Great seating area in the sun or under cover as well as inside, and super easy with kids. Definitely recommend this to any locals or travellers looking for a great coffee!< /text>

Great coffee. They use a roaster out of the LA area that I am familiar with as provided great flavorful coffee. The menu is small but everything was quite tasty. I will definitely put this place on my morning route.<//Text>

I had such a wonderful experience at Red Bee.  The service was so personal and the quality of beverages- top notch!  The mother/mother-in-law of the owners bakes several types of goodies from scratch and was quick to inform me of options.  I highly recommend the chai latte and mocha as both are created from homemade bases!</Text>

I stumbled upon Red Bee with my boyfriend while we did laundry nearby. My iced Chai was everything I’ve ever wanted from a Chai that typical chains can’t seem to deliver. My boyfriend had no regrets downing his almond-milk latte. We also tried some delicious gluten-free treats including some superfood bites and amazing Brazilian cheese bread. Seriously, the Pao de Queijo was so good we had to order seconds.</text>

They brew Klatch Coffee correctly, their food items are fresh and delicious, and there is enough room to feel cozy but not cramped. The patio is a nice option too if it is warm outside.</Review>< pics>

My girlfriend and I were staying around the corner for a few days and we decided to stop by for the first time on our last day for breakfast, and boy what a mistake!

We should have made this one of our first stops!  Red Bee has a great atmosphere and you feel it the instant you walk inside the door, greeted by smiling faces and  the waft of delicious coffee, breakfast paninis and pastries this place does not disappoint.

I would highly recommend the chai which I was told they make in house, it has a nice spice and layers of all the different spices. We cant wait for our next trip back!< /review>

Was in and out in about an hour. Kinda slow check in. Easy docks. Drop trailer and bobtail to the Cowboy BBQ restaurant 1 mile down the road. $15 to park there overnight but you can get a good meal there too and it'll cover your parking (usually).< /Review>

It wasn't a bad experience and I didn't lose too much time. They didn't have a empty trailer available so my pre loaded trailer obviously wasn't pre loaded. I ran my empty to this location and waited for them to call me. It might've been about a 1 hour wait. They'll get you moving again.</review>

One of worst places to pick up. First u have to check in with security then go inside and check in again then u get a door. You park in your door have to unhook and leave the property. They took about 6hrs to load. If you can get another load somewhere else take it.</text>

I use the coupon for a double cheeseburger and french fries it was good the people that helped me wear nice. She actually brought my bag of food out to the table on the front patio. They gave me a cup of ice water to. I think there were only two employees working they were busy on a scale of 10 I would give them an eighth< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Ordered a rocky road blizzard. The taste I got was like opening up a can of peanuts that has been sitting in your cupboard for 3 years, stale, horrific, and something that you just want to throw straight into the trash can. The consistency was also similar to a malt. You can definitely not turn a malt upside down and serve it to a customer.
I also ordered a pumpkin pie Blizzard, they definitely used chopped up graham cracker instead of real pumpkin pie crust. this place is a fraud, avoid at all cost...thank you have a nice day.<//text>< pictures>

<text>It seems like people think this is the only Dairy Queen in the area. There is a new one on Arden and Highland. This particular one is great and all but it is always busy at night. You end up sitting in your car 30-45 minutes waiting. Make sure you have good music, good people and great patience. I like the one at Fiesta Village in Colton. They give you a huge ice cream cone on your birthday</text>< pictures>

Went there. Was told my total was 7.54. Didn't get a receipt. Checked my account to realize they are charged me 21.68 for 2 mini blizzards. Try calling them and no one answered. Make sure you get a receipt... Otherwise they will charge you whatever they want.<//Text>

Hire different people with better customer service skills. If it doesn't cost anything give your customers NAPKINS!! nothing is more frustrating than to drive off with food or ice cream and no napkins.   This has happened on several occasions.  They ask for your order but goes silence after that so not sure what these young kids are doing but this is a place of business. Hope this place get better because the food is good but the service here SUCKS!!< /Text>

Just got home from drive thru and HORRIBLE service.  First no bag, she hands us everything 2 sundaes, ice cream cone and two drinks.  No carrier.  No ketchup. No straws.  No bag. Just a box and handed us everything else.  Food is sub par and tasted like burger king</text>

The prices on the drive thru board are wrong by 20 cents or more per item. Told the person at the drive thru window and she did not seem to care. This is my first and last time to visit DQ.</Review>

<text>So my son goes to diary queen for my family and me about every weekend to get a blizzard but I never get one because they are always out of chocolate ice cream.  So my son asked the worker why not and the worker says it is on a timer to stop making it around 7pm REALLY.  How can you have a business that is specialize in dessert and you can't get chocolate ice cream 😕.  I used to go there all the time with family and spend about 65.00 dollars a weekend but not anymore i guess I will take my money to cold stones again. So I can have something like a blizzard. I don't know how you can make a great profit if you can't make desserts. My son went there last night even and no chocolate.<//text>< Pics>

These guys put in the work the other day kept the constant line of 14 cars moving quick. I parked to eat our blizzard after making it thru and the cars just kept pulling in. I am not sure how they kept it moving so well. Good attitude , keep it up!<//review>

Although it was a hot day, there were no other customers in the store. I placed my order through the app and everything was ready within 5 minutes. This location was clean inside and outside. I noticed tables outside which would have been nice to use if it weren't so hot out.</Text>

Although the idea seemed nice when i received a pup cup from the drive through window. My puppy only took a few licks that night and we had to take her to the Vets the next morning. Poor thing was not herself, her ears were down and barely moved. I was told dogs should not have milk or dairy. I personally love their ice cream, but please don't give it to your dog.<//Text>

ZERO STARS So the drive thru is 10 cars deep.  The ap says you can place order and go in and pick up.  So i get out of line and order online which charges me.  Ap says hit button to tell them you are here.  Go to door and it's locked.  So now I have paid and there is another 5 cars in front of me. Manager RUDE claims no control over ap. How can you have no control over your own ap??? Only way now to get food I already charged for is get back in line.  Ap shouldn't take  order and charge if service not available. Then when i get order claims they are out of chocolate icecream?? REALLY??<//text>

<Review>Friendly staff and most of the time my order is correct. Went yesterday and my cheese curd container was barely half full...pretty disappointed! For the price of the menu items, I expect that I will receive a full size order. Maybe slow down a little to ensure quality control.

2 weeks later came back for a mini blizzard (for my kiddo) and a small blizzard for me.  Threw receipt in my purse without looking but next day saw they charged me for a medium and small blizzard.  Still need to work on the quality control.</Review></record>

I have never been to this dairy queen. I got my teens medium blizzards today...and they were tiny!!!! No more than 10-12 ounces. I asked and confirmed that they gave me the right size. I don't know if it's just this location Jippin people or if this is the new standard for dairy queen, but that was an unacceptable for $4.29.< /review>

Friendly employees - 2 thumbs up.  Gave me ranch for the onion rings (didn't ask for that) 1 thumb up,  but didn't give me the honey-mustard dipping sauce for my chicken strips. Two thumbs down...

I'd go back tho because of the friendly employees,  however I'd ensure my order was right instead of 5 miles down the 215...</review>

When ask for lids/tops to be put on they follow-thru and are always pleasant about it.

Ordered 3- 3pc. Chicken strip meal. Never gave me the 3 sundaes. So irritated that I got home and realized this.  Also ordered 2 starwberry and was given 2 chocolate. This place is getting as bad as KFC down the street.</Review>

<Date>1573424868583</Date><review>On November 10th at approximately 1:15, I came through the drive-thru and placed an order. By the time I got home I realized they didn't give my husband's ATM card back so I turned around. They told me that they wouldn't return the card without proper ID. (They certainly didn't check my ID when I initially paid for my order). When I explained the situation, I was told not  to argue and that my husband had to come pick up the card. We both met with the manager Betty who was very uncooperative (classic millennial). Betty disappeared with my husband's picture ID in the back for five minutes which made us very nervous. His ATM card was already under their control for 30 minutes and now they also had his ID! Betty did a cash refund instead of reversing the charge on the card (weird). Betty refused to give her last name and was reluctant to give the owner's name. Now we feel we should keep a watchful eye on our card transactions to make sure that there are no unauthorized purchases on my husband's ATM card. Do not come here for the sheer fact that your financial info may be compromised, the employees are inept and unfriendly and the customer service is terrible.</review><UserId.>102446463870577900010< /UserId.><response>{'time': 1573477343097, 'text': 'Hi Kara, this is the Dairy Queen Corporate Fan relations team.

<review>The Blizzards were half melted when we got them in the drive through, the cups were already sticky with the ice cream running down the side. Our order was wrong and we had to correct them. No lids for the runny blizzards were provided until another employee was brought in to solve the wrong order. Overall it wasn't the worst fast food experience I've had but it definitely left a bad impression<//review>< pics>

The second time I went I got a malt and chicken & fries and it was practically flawless.
Both times I went, the customer service was great and the food was fresh and delicious.</Review>< Pictures>

We have been waiting for a Dairy Queen to open up in north San Bernardino for years...and we were not disappointed. The employees were bright and cheerful. The menu has enough variety. We had Blizzards tonight but want to go back for a meal real soon. 😋<//Review>

Think twice before your disappointed. Ordered a cheesecake blizzard w/extra cheesecake but I probably had less cheesecake than a normal blizzard. Not worth the $6.50. They need some training on ingredient portions. I hope other people have a better experience.</Text>

Drive thru is OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE 6 DALLOR DEALS AND 4 BUCK DEAL ARE AMAZING FOR A BUDGET MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP AND SCAN IN POINTS BEFORE U PAY FREE FOOD IS ALWAYS GOOD AND UR POINTS GET U THAT.. also another perk of downloading the app is the free coupons of free ice cream you get also buy one get one free coupons that also comes along with the app so don't despair download and get to your next DQ ASAP.<//Text>

I saw the sign and I thought need an ice cream . So I got in line behind five cars.. and I ordered me a mint Oreo cookie blizzard.. imagine my feelings of joy, when this fat boy could get a second one for 80 cents... I almost cried with joy</Text>

<Review>Will go to the one in Inland Center mall. Always good quality. Great smoothies and food. Unfortunately this is the worse experience at a Dairy Queen. Very unprofessional. As this restaurant gets older Starbucks and 711 will bury them. Sad bc wanted something local for our residents.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c351d84a85e787:0x93ef570c51db6025< /gmapID></record>

Not sure if she was having a rough night, but customer service was rather rude. I don't go to DQ very much and that's a great way to keep me away. I got the chicken bacon ranch and it was good, but the chicken was a bit dried out. Fries were good, blizzard was good, friend that we were with thought the turkey sandwich she ordered was good, but noted the turkey seemed like sandwich meat. The new building looks fantastic! Overall a meh experience. Will not go out of my way to come back. But my wife does love DQ...</Text>

<review>Got the $6 value meal and the cheese burger and the fries were nasty. I guess they were just sitting there for a while before they gave them to me. Everything was cold 👎<//review>< Time>

<text>My daughter's and I were very excited to see one was opening up nearby. We went the second day it opened. Waited about 20min in the drive thru. Customer service wasn't great. Went a few days after.. same thing and noticed the blizzard portion was a lot less. Went a few times after thinking by now they should have it down.. still. Over 15min wait in drive thru, the person who takes the orders doesn't know much about the products, and have to yell at the speaker when I talk bcuz apparently they can't hear me with the correct order. I love DQ product, but I don't think it's fair how the customer service is. Manager meant well trying to hire young ppl, but hiring experienced individuals to mentor them until they got a better understanding I think would've been smarter. There's times I'm tempted to go get something, but then I remember the long wait time and the whole ordering process, just reminds me why I probably shouldn't go. Love to support local business.. but not like this. You don't pay for what you get...<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Usually when I've gone through the drive in the employee takes their time and clarifies what I'm order. Not this evening.  Seemed like was in a rush and was surprised when I gave my drink request. Needless to say I didn't order everything.</Review>
