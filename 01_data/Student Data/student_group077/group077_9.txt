One of my preferred spots for quality cheap food. It was so delicious. Service is consistently great. The place has a good atmosphere. Ambience reminds me of San Diego's scene.</Text>

I ordered thru DoorDash the other night. I got two bowls beef and chicken with veggies. I like having green onion in my bowls too which they add for free. I did call and request extra magic sauce and my order arrived exactly as requested. Really good customer service. I highly recommend.< /Text>

<Review>Good value. Healthy, fresh and fast. Wished that veggies were cut a little smaller and hot sauce wasn’t too vinegary. But that’s just my personal opinion. It was still delicious and I enjoyed my meal a lot.<//Review></record>

Flame Broiler is always healthy, consistently high quality food.  You can order half and half bowls.  Call ahead to avoid waiting in line and for easy pickup and take out.  The tofu is a great option, as are the mini bowls when you just want a smaller meal option.  The beef is super tender.< /Review>

Excellent place for lunch/dinner.

- Fast (typicall 5-10 minutes from order to eating)
- Cheap ($7-12 based on size and protein options)
- Healthy-ish (depends on how much magic sauce you smother it in)</text>

The veggies are not mushy, but crisp. The meat is decent quality. Not oily. It tastes like quality food that you would receive at a quality sit down dating joint.< /review>

After we ordered and were handed drink cups, we went to the soda fountain to find that a couple sodas were out of order and if we wanted one of those drinks to ask for it at the counter. The lady working there looked confused when I asked her for Sprite. She said it only comes in a can and she would give it to me if I paid $1. Why should I pay more? I already bought a drink. She ended up just giving me the can for no additional charge, but she made me give her back the cup which I HOPE she does not put back and give to another customer. Despite just opening, the tables were covered in rice which means the tables were dirty all night. The food was hot and fresh. The overall taste was decent. Before leaving, I noticed that a fountain drink cost MORE than a can. Even though it was only a dollar plus change difference and I didnt want to make a huge deal out of it, the lady working at the cash register made a face and walked away as soon as I pointed it out. First visit to Flame Broiler, will most likely NEVER come to this location again.</Text>

Been coming back and forth to this place for about a month now, and every time it’s perfect. Food is great, not a long wait time, and the staff always is smiling and friendly. 10 out of 5 stars if I could.< /Text>

<text>Standard chicken bowl fare. Not much to say about rice, chicken and vegetables. I should have ordered with double meat. But, I just hate having to pay extra for more meat. You'd spend almost $15 for a meal. I think I can get a better value somewhere else.<//text>< Pics>

Tofu takes an extra 10 min wait but totally worth it. If you want rice with a protein this place is perfect. They have the option of veggies but I personally never get them.

It's so simple but so delicious. Very clean food. Exactly how it's advertised. I go here all the time. Yum</Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Not bad fast food style joint. The meat is pretty tasty but I would prefer they cook their vegetables or cook them more. The extreme crunch on top of soft meat and rice is off putting to me.

Great location too! So if you are shopping at Ralphs and that made you too tired to cook, come check this place out.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Flame Broiler is my favorite fast food spot in San Diego! Screw McDonalds and all these other places that microwave your food for your, I want mine fresh, and fast! I always get the chicken bowl with vegetables. I also suggest asking for less rice and extra veggies! Pour some of their delicious secret sauce and hot sauce all over it and go to town!!<//Review><Time>1392162112276< /Time><pics>None<//pics>< user_name>

<review>After walking here from my office, I found a long hair in my food took it back and the manager Juan was rude and insinuated that I'm a scammer, scam them over 8 bucks? If you like eating hair for lunch this place is for you! I also noticed a mop bucket on the food counters very appetizing.<//review><user>112519891067444308765<//user><username>Dean S<//username>< Gmap_id>

The choices are great. However , the chicken was quite dry as was the organic tofu. I was quite surprised as the bowl I had from Flame Broiler in La Jolla was perfect.</Review>

<text>Everything was dirty(tables, trash can, counter, and the sauce dispensers were hideous).  The cashier didn't stop talking on her cell phone while taking our order. Rude and lazy. When everything looks dirty,  it makes you feel like your food is going to be dirty as well.<//text>< GmapID>

Just confirming hair in the food. Workers literally never have hairnets! The food is good though. It's really is a shame they don't practice good hygiene, my wife and I would usually there once a week or more until I got hair in my food. Haven't eaten there since - I've gone back several times to see if they upped there hygiene, but they never have. Makes me wonder what other bad habits the restaurant has. Really good food, but I could never recommend or advice eating at the restaurant.<//Text>

<Text>A typical flamebroiler, fast, friendly service and good food. There was this horrible lady accosting one of the employees because she was confused on how to order and what comes with a plate, even though there is signage all over the place exlpaining exactly that. The employee helping said her name was Theresa and she handled it well< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80d955394ae581db:0x3ae3d220f8e138a5<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>This food is TERRIBLE, the meat is bottom of the barrel, they literally toss ice burg lettuce and some chicken in a bowl and charge you $8.  NOT worth it.  Couldn't even give my friend half brown half white rice.  The guy at the front counter was NOT suited to be serving people.  I saw him pick his nose as well.  Beware!</text>< GmapID>

<Review>The first time I had Flame Broiler was at this location. And I was just about a week ago. The food is very similar to Waba Grill if you have ever been there. Personally, I think Waba Grill is better. Just look at the menu, it's pretty easy. If you're Fitness minded person who tracks their Macro Nutrients, this, and Waba Grill may help you get your protein in. The wait time at this location even during lunch time wasn't too bad. The chicken and beef do not come with sauce on it, which is good for macro tracking. Unlike Waba Grill they put sauce on it by default, but you could easily tell them not to do it. Just some extra sugar that you don't need. When comparing the taste Flame Broiler meat and Waba Grill meat, I would have to go with Waba Grill on that one.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

What a great gym!  Brand new equipment, including a massage bed!  It has a few extras that are great perks for members, including charging stations for your devices, towel service, coffee, and heavy bags for boxing just to name a few.

If cleanliness is important to you this place obviously takes that seriously as the floors and equipment are constantly cleaned. The downside of many gyms is the bathrooms, but they are actually a strength here as they are spacious and tiled with everything you need.

Combine all this with a courteous manager and you've got a great find.</Review>

NOT A FRAGRANCE FREE FACILITY.

I signed up.  I had no idea how highly perfumed the air is.

Not only  is air freshener circulating through the main circulating system in the entire gym .....there are air freshener plug ins in all bathrooms, and a separate “air scent station” in the Massage machine room.

As a person with fragrance allergies, this will not work for me.

So, be aware of this before you join.

I was told that I need to wait 30 days after I joined to switch to a gym that does not have this air pollution.

Very unhappy.</Text>

A really nice gym. Even though restrictions are lifted in contra costa now, some days they are open, some days they aren't. No signage, no returned phone calls, no emails indicating what their hours actually are, so it can be maddening finding out that you aren't able to work out simply because your card won't open the door at some point. Doing my best to be patient, but maybe updating something...literally anything...with what your hours really are right now would help.<//text>

This gym is one of kind! You can see that the owner really, really cares!!
From the equipment, bathrooms, flowers, massage room, and the list goes on! Even the suggestion box!! I been in many Anytime fitness gyms, starting in Europe! This one sets a really high standard for any gyms around the globe! I just hope the visitors will share the same vision with the gym owners! Just be tidy and respectful and this will be your best gym ever!</Text>

<Review>Great, clean facility with a helpful staff that always answers my questions.  The gym itself is extremely clean and well maintained!  Definitely recommend to anyone to who wants to workout and get in shape. They also have trainers to help get you where you need to reach your goals.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

You forget your in Compton when you enter the store . A new ,fresh look  just what the city needs. And the customer service is outstanding. You wont leave here disappointed. As a matter a fact you might not visit another liquor store again. Its that great. I give it 10 *'s</Text>

I would leave a 10 star review if I could. Doctor was phenomenal and the staff was super helpful and understanding. Best optometry office I've ever been to (had glasses since the 4th grade) so do yourself a favor and go here!< /review>

Overall I’m very satisfied with my care here. The facility is immaculately clean and pretty organized. I absolutely adore doctor Peng, she is thorough and attentive to the compete care of your eyes. Paired with her wonderful bedside manner she’s a 10/10. Christy is also very pleasant to work with and is very sweet. In honesty I’ve had some weird interactions with some of the other folks that work here but Dr. Peng and the cleanliness really make it all worthwhile. Definitely recommend Glendale Opto!<//text>

< Review>
I will not purchase my eyeglasses anywhere else. They repaired my eyeglasses in 5 minutes, AT NO CHARGE, even though I had not purchased my eyeglasses there, and I did not have an appointment which is required now due to Covid.  Contrast this with the place that originally sold me the glasses;  they said it was out of warranty, so they had to charge me, and it had to be sent to the lab for a simple repair, which would have left me without my primary glasses for days.< /Review>

<Text>UPDATE: Stacey, the owner followed up with me twice. She offered an apology and a refund for the eye scan. Glad she takes these reviews seriously. While I’m not sure I’d go back, I would hope they can avoid these issues going forward.

I've got a few things to say here:
1) I really liked my optometrist: Dr. Kellie Kanamoto. I would go back to her again. Great consultation, very nice and friendly. She helped me figure out exactly what I needed. She gets 5 stars.... Unfortunately, this establishment does not.

2) When I was first called in to get an eye exam before seeing my doctor, they never told me that I'd be charged for the 3D photo of my eye. Which was a shock to me when it was added to my bill and my insurance did NOT cover it. It was also weird that my optometrist even said something like, "thanks for letting us take that photo of your eyes" which implied they had asked for consent and told me I could be charged.

3) When I picked up my glasses (Today 1/4/2021), I called in advance to ask how I could do this. They said, just call when you get there and they will take it to your car.  I did that. And then proceeded to wait nearly 30 minutes because they forgot. This resulted in me being late for a meeting. When I asked what happened, they couldn't even just admit that they forgot. Instead, both times I called they kept on giving me BS like, "Let me see what happened" or "I just got back from my lunch" and "I'm not sure what happened". Just f-ing tell me you forgot.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>It was quick and easy to get an appointment. The staff was helpful and courteous. I've seen many, many optometrists in the past 10-15 years and Dr. Peng and Glendale Optometric Center is my favorite.< /Review>< Time>

<review>I saw Dr. Gin because I've had 5 refractions in 12 months and none were correct.  She was recommended by my optical provider as the best refractor in Glendale.  That was correct advice.  She nailed it.  First try.  Fast.  Accurate.  My new prescription was comfortable from the moment I put the glasses on!  She was knowledgeable, professional, and actually listened to me.  In addition, the assistant who performed preliminary tests was the best I've ever experienced.  The equipment was modern.  The facility was impeccable.  Everything was first class and geared to patient comfort and convenience from the parking lot (free and right at the door) to the friendly, knowledgeable, helpful staff,  and the comfortable waiting room.  I have decided to change my primary vision provider to Glendale Optometric.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I was satisfied with my previous optometrists, but decided to give Glendale Optometric Center a try at the recommendation of several friends in the Glendale area.  I was not disappointed. The staff is very friendly and efficient. David, the technician ran several tests very thoroughly using the latest equipment, including a state of the art instrument that takes a scan of the entire retina, and then got things ready for the beautiful and charming, Dr. Stacy Gin, who administered my eye exam, again with the latest equipment.  Dr Stacy then reviewed the results of all the tests with me.  Finally Greg  showed me a wide selection of frames and lens options to choose from and then measured me for my glasses.  Altogether a great experience.<//review>

<Text>I just had my eye exam yesterday. They are great. The staff is really nice! Dr. Gin is a true professional. She explained all of my results thoroughly. I would recommend Glendale Optometric Center to anyone. I was in-and-out quickly and they performed a thorough exam. Two thumbs up and five stars!!!<//Text>< pics>

I had a very good experience  nice customer service, clear pricing and they sat down with me and explained what my coverage included and offered me options in order to pay less. Very good range of frames.<//text>

I've been seeing Dr. Gin ever since she took over the practice at Glendale Optometric Center.  She is very thorough.  I have type 2 diabetes and she continues to monitor my eyes, pressure, bleeding in the cornea and all those fun things.  My eyes continue to change so my prescription is updated annually.  I really feel like I'm receiving great vision care from Dr. Gin, Greg and her staff.<//Text>

I was satisfied with my previous optometrists, but decided to give Glendale Optometric Center a try at the recommendation of several friends in the Glendale area.  I was not disappointed. The staff is very friendly and efficient. David, the technician ran several tests very thoroughly using the latest equipment, including a state of the art instrument that takes a scan of the entire retina, and then got things ready for the beautiful and charming, Dr. Stacy Gin, who administered my eye exam, again with the latest equipment.  Dr Stacy then reviewed the results of all the tests with me.  Finally Greg  showed me a wide selection of frames and lens options to choose from and then measured me for my glasses.  Altogether a great experience.</Review>

They are amazing here! Super friendly, very professional, incredibly knowledgeable. They don't mind answering questions, no matter how silly you think they might be. And every one takes time to explain everything until you are comfortable. Definitely highly recommend them!<//Text>

My husband and I have been going to Glendale Optometric for many years and they just keep getting better.  As we get older, it has been great to get detailed information about what we should be looking for as our eyes age.  It's nice knowing that they are looking out for us too.< /review>

As a longtime patient of Glendale Optometric Center (I’ve been going there since I was little), I can honestly say this is a great place for eye care. The office itself provides a welcoming environment and the doctors are so friendly and get to know their patients personally. And they carry so many different frames to choose from it makes shopping for new glasses fun!</text>

<Review>GREAT EXPERIENCE ALL AROUND...:-)
Dr GIN is a woman of a few words but she gets the job done and well! She managed to get me the right prescription after several other optometrists failed. So there!
And LIZ, the optician, is a gem! She is a total professional and very knowledgeable. She took the time to make sure that my glasses fit perfectly. And kept adjusting them on following visits until they did. I will definitely go back to that office. And YES, I highly recommmend it!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I have been long time customers for the past 22 years!
We would not go anywhere else!

They are courteous, experienced and very professional. They have State of the Art equipment, and we both entrust our eyes to them without hesitation.

We also purchase all of our glasses and contacts in their built in optical store.
It's a One Stop care for your eyes!
Highly reccomended!</Text>

<Review>I've been a customer for approximately 4-years. Doctors Gin and Nishi are fantastic, and can't forget about Dale and the staff. I first tried contacts at Glendale Optometric Center, and Dr. Nishi and I became fast friends, as I was in his office 13-times, trying to find a contact which had comfort and with which I could see. He was very patient with me, and always very pleasant and cheerful.

I moved from Glendale to Orange County 2-years ago, but still travel back annually to Glendale Optometric Center. They are the best.</Review>< pics>

Please do not order glass from this store in Glendale. We ordered a pair of glass on March 9th and eventually we had to cancel the order. I called them more than 6-8 times to follow up on glass for my 80 years old husband which he had to renew his license and need them bad.

I spoke to few employees and eventually  Denis from optical deportment told me she contacted lab and there is an issue with frame. She said she'll get back to me but she never did. She was very rude and never said "sorry" for the situation we were going thru after paying over $300 full in payment. Eventually I called back and spoke to Garry the store manager and owner and I found him very dishonest person. He told me another story of they lost the frame and they sent another frame to the lab but he could not tell me when our glass will be ready. He was lying and I told him he doesn't make any sense and I had to cancel our order . He admitted the employees should told us long before they glass were lost.  Very very bad customer service . Greg canceled the order and claim to our vision insurance but he didn't bother to call the lab and cancel the order with them.

When I contacted our vision insurance they had to call the store and Greg didn't bother to speak to insurance and just told them "he called the lab and cancelled the order". Than our insurance called the lab and spoke to Kris and Kris told no once never called them to cancel the order.  So he go head and canceled the order after 20 days. Now we are waiting for lab to cancel the order until our vision insurgence to reset the benefit back. So we can go somewhere else to order glass. ( Tri focus) .

All the reviews and stars for this place is Fake. They don't apologize you and they don't tell your the truth. Just such a wasting time.< /text>

<review>I ordered new contacts and was given the wrong prescription. When I received the supposed corrected lenses they were the wrong color which they refused to fix saying it was over the three month warranty. Worst service ever. Now I have contacts that are two different colors. If you enjoy being swindled, this is the place to go to.< /review>< pics>

Dr. Nishi is the fricken eye magician.

I never thought I would be raving about an eye clinic or an eye doctor but daaamnnn this place is awesome. While all the other eye doctors in the world were dozing off at eyeball school Dr. Nishi was obviously the only one getting straight A's.

This is the first place I've ever gone to where I've had an eye prescription that was perfectly accurate. Dr. Nishi is a genius. This is the first prescription in my life that I haven't noticed a slightly skewed vision like past incorrect prescriptions from other doctors. I have a slight astigmatism just in one eye and I don't even notice it anymore  with whatever magic Dr. Nishi has done and my entire life I have noticed it. It's like being reborn.

The entire staff is friendly and very knowledgeable and helpful. This a very professional place with very talented doctors. I highly recommend everybody go here.<//Text>

Staff was friendly and polite but will never return since they overcharge for service. Spark plugs that cost $36 each ($216 total + $400 for labor) Auto zone has same exact plugs for $16. I was also charged $134 for diagnostic (many other shops waive this when you have service done). The cost of injector cleaning was also inflated $136 for cleaning + $70 for induction cleaning kit.  Ive seen much lower costs for this service in the past. This is a AAA approved shop so I was able to get a &50 discount but still felt robbed after I left. Total for spark plugs diagnostic and injection cleaning was $928 dollars!  One lost customer won’t make a difference since they are very busy but do your homework before getting service done here!< /Review>

Took my truck in primarily for some power steering issues I was experiencing. The problems were intermittent and didn’t cause me too many issues at first. Dropped my truck off Saturday May 8th at 8:30 am, and after the initial diagnosis, they listed off a slew of other suggested services to include replacing and flushing out the power steering pumps. After agreeing to only a few of the suggested services along with the power steering maintenance  they gave me an original completion time of Monday afternoon. They never gave me updates and it took me calling multiple times to receive information about my vehicle. Each time I called they told me they needed another day. It took them 5 days of delay for them to tell me that even after replacing and flushing the power steering pump, that my truck required  additional maintenance to the steering rack. Irritated with the lack of professionalism and the overwhelming feeling that they were dragging me along, I decided to pick up my truck and see if all the other maintenance done would at-least suffice in the near term. To my dismay, my power steering was EXPONENTIALLY WORSE than it was when I had dropped it off the week prior. $2400 dollars (not including rental vehicle costs) and 6 days later, I was returned a truck that was in worse condition than when I had dropped it off. I literally feel like I was robbed. To all those in need of vehicle maintenance, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Quality service, punctuality, and professionalism will not be found here.

**Update** Took my truck to another shop and my truck did not need a new steering rack! They installed a new pump in less than 48 hours and my steering is better than ever. Glad I listened to my gut and left Carlsbad Auto Service when I did. I saved myself over $1000 on what would have been an unnecessary steering rack replacement!< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1621292985085, 'text': "Hi Devin, I’m sorry to read that you were not satisfied with the work we performed on your vehicle. I have made several attempts to contact you by phone and text in the last few days in order to discuss your issues and how we can resolve your power steering issue, but I have not heard back from you.\n\nI apologize for the delay and understand your frustration that the work on your vehicle was not completed in a timelier manner, but the delay was caused by multiple, unanticipated circumstances that were, unfortunately, out of our control. When the vehicle arrived at our shop, the power steering pump had been run dry because of a pressure line that was leaking and the steering was hard. We filled the pump with fluid, but it would not build pressure to pump the fluid through the system to give you power assist. We replaced the pump and pressure hose then test drove the vehicle, and the power steering would intermittently come and go, which was better than it was when the vehicle came in. We noticed that the power steering fluid turned very dark after our first test drive, so we flushed the system several more times in an effort to spare you the expense of replacing the rack and pinion assembly which was always a possibility from the start that it might need to be replaced. At this point, after flushing the system several times, there was nothing more that we could do other than replace the rack and pinion assembly which you declined. It is not out of the realm of possibility that the remanufactured pump we installed was defective or may have gotten contaminated from the first test drive. I would like to check the pump to make sure. I would welcome the opportunity to inspect your vehicle personally and see what we can do to fix this issue.\n\nIt's important to us that our customers are satisfied and happy with the work we perform. I would like the opportunity to discuss this further with you and resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Please call me at the number I left in my text message to you. I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks. Wayne Milack, Owner\n\n**REPLY TO UPDATE** Devin, If the power steering pump was defective, it's covered under warranty. All I need is for you to bring the power steering pump that we installed in your vehicle back to us with a receipt from the other shop showing that they replaced the defective pump, and I will refund you the price of the pump and the labor to replace it.

I took my truck there for a smog since they handled it so well the last time I was there. Unfortunately, the truck failed smog and it required more diagnostics. They quoted me 1 price and then kept calling and changing the price on me. Started with a quote for $130 for diagnostics. Then changed it to $260 after I approved the $130. I pulled my truck from them and took it to another shop. The numbers that their smog showed were completely different then the ones from the shop I took it to after where it passed. It feels like they tried to rob me thinking I would approve unneeded maintenance. They were awesome to me 2 years ago, I’m not sure if it is because the staff has changed, but the way Ralph handled the situation will make me never come back.</text>
<Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1620231464945, 'text': 'Braden, I understand your disappointment that your truck failed the smog check. Unfortunately, your truck requires more labor time to diagnose the failure as it is equipped with a carburetor that is more time-consuming to troubleshoot and to eliminate as a possible contributing factor concerning the high emission readings. You also must factor in the age of your vehicle and the 360,495 miles that it has been driven. These vehicles fail smog tests for many reasons, and usually there are multiple issues stacked on top of each other that we must sort out to accurately estimate the cost of repairs. Therefore, in this case the two hours labor charge for the diagnosis is fair and reasonable.\n\nYou state in your review that your truck passed the smog check at another shop after you left our shop and that the readings were different than our readings. A vehicle can be tested several times in a row and have different sets of readings. It is quite common for most vehicles to not have the exact same readings on every test. Several days, though, after your review was written, I looked up the smog test history of your truck on the state website, which is updated daily, and as of May 4, 2021 your truck had not been tested or passed a smog test since we last tested it and it failed on April 30, 2021.\n\nIn our telephone conversation, you also told me that you informed our Service Advisor that you just had a new catalytic converter installed. I personally inspected the catalytic converter when your truck was in our shop, together with my technician before and after your truck failed, and it had an old, rusted converter not a new one. It looked like it was the original one the truck came with.\n\nWe’re sorry that you didn’t enjoy working with our Service Advisor who is one of our dedicated team of professionals who all place great customer service as a priority and work very hard to provide the best experience possible for all of our customers.\n\nAs I mentioned in our telephone conversation, I would welcome the opportunity to review the test report you received from the smog check at another shop where you said your vehicle passed. Thanks. Wayne Milack, Owner'}</Resp>< GmapID>

I recently moved to Carlsbad and needed to get my car checked before I could register it. Carlsbad Auto Service, Inc was absolutely amazing to work with. I arrived and they greeted me at the door. provided a warm and welcoming environment. They answered all of my questions and got right to work on checking my car. The environment was clean and following strict covid protocols. As a new resident of California, this will be my mechanic as long as I am here.</review>

I highly recommend Carlsbad Auto Service! Mike was super helpful, professional and kept me updated with everything that was going on with my car. The mechanics went above and beyond to trace down the issues my 2009 Subaru Legacy GT was having with electrical, vacuum, radiator and throttle body issues! The price on the repairs and parts were great and I had my Subie back on the road and running great really quick! It's great to have such an honest/professional local shop to rely on and I'll always bring my cars here in the future! Thanks Mike and the crew at Carlsbad Auto Service for everything I truly appreciate you all!</Review>

I have a pretty good automotive background and I did check comments from previous customers. You don't keep the doors open since 1985 if you lack the knowledge and service skills in automotive repair and keep ahead of the curve as today cars have become increasingly technically challenging. My previous auto repair shop owner for 20 years retired for the RV road, leaving a group of us without a reliable and honest  repair center.

I went here for an oil change. I found it to be a no-nonsense, quality auto shop. They did the work as promised for a great price. Gave me good advice about other repairs needed, but without pressure. The shop is located near the village, so I spent the time waiting at a funeral coffee shop.  All in all it was a great experience and I plan to return.<//Review>

Told them what I wanted and asked them to recommend anything when they’re under there. They were honest about what I truly needed and what I might need. My car ran great after. I’m going back for further preventative repairs.

Lacking technical skills. Brought in 4runner for misfire. Suspected head gasket leak myself. Dropped off overnight and they confirmed a leak on cylinder 3. Quoted me 3k for the fix and 5 6k for the engine replacement...on the wrong engine. I didn't have a 4x4 and I had to correct them.

Decided to park my car until I could save for it and went back to pick it up. Btw if you have a job good luck getting there before they close.

When I picked it up it was parked between two completely broken cars. They handed me the keys and expected me to figure it out. Had to ask some one to move one of the cars just so I could back out. Took over an hour just to drive off the lot.

Once I did get driving my truck was now misfiring WAY WORSE THAN BEFORE.  LOUD engine noise,  lots of smoke! Keep in mind all they did was pull spark plugs and inspected inside the cylinder... barely got home and checked they spark plugs. THEY WERE ALL HAND LOOSE. NO TORQUE ON ANY OF MY SPARK PLUGS!

I tighted everything myself back down to spec. Ran a bottle of Stop Leak through the coolant for $50 and did it step by step myself. (They did not offer that option at all)

4 months later I am still driving the 4runner with no codes, no back fires, no issues at all.

They did not care about me, my car, or doing a professional job. They got their $150 fee and told me I had a leaking radiator,  I don't.

I would actively not recommend this place to my friends.<//Review>

{'time': 1595343723435, 'text': 'I’m sorry to hear, John, that you were not pleased with the service you received on March 10, 2020. I apologize for any inconvenience you experienced when picking up your vehicle late in the afternoon, but our parking lot can get a little busy at times. I would like to clarify some of the concerns that you stated in your review. First, I’d like to explain what was done to determine that your truck has a leaking head gasket on Cylinder #3. We initially scanned your engine computer, and it coded a P0303 indicating that the engine had a misfire in Cylinder #3 and a code P0117 indicating that your engine overheated and exceeded 286 degrees Fahrenheit. We removed the #3 spark plug and inserted a bore scope to visually inspect the cylinder. The technician observed that the cylinder was washed clean indicating that coolant was leaking into the #3 cylinder when under pressure. This was confirmed when he pressurized the cooling system and observed coolant leaking down the cylinder wall. The technician said he only removed the #3 cylinder spark plug and noted that when he removed it, it was only hand tight. He informed me that he did not remove the other spark plugs because our scanner indicated that #3 was the only cylinder with a misfire. Therefore, there was absolutely no reason to go any further after his diagnosis. Perhaps, the last shop that replaced the spark plugs did not tighten them enough.\n\nThe reason the engine ran rough when you picked it up is because there was some residual coolant in the cylinder left over from the test, even though he cleared as much as he could before reinstalling the spark plug. It should have burned off after a few minutes of driving.\n\nWe do not recommend using a sealer for this type of repair because we cannot guarantee the quality or longevity of the repair. Cooling system sealers are designed as an emergency stopgap, a temporary repair that is not permanent. They are notorious for creating other restrictions in the radiator and other components of the cooling system on high mileage engines.\n\nThe fact remains you still have a leaking head gasket that has been temporarily stopped and will eventually reappear because it is not a permanent fix. In my professional opinion after being in business here at Carlsbad Auto Service for over 35 years and being an ASE Certified Master Technician myself, we recommended the correct repair of replacing the engine considering the 212,000 miles on your vehicle that has existing head gasket problems and has been severely overheated. After looking into this situation in depth, we stand by our diagnosis.\n\nIf you would like to discuss this further, please don’t hesitate to call me directly.\n\nWayne Milack\nOwner'}<//Resp>

Stu Rambo was my Service Consultant.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating.  Stu didn't try to sell me services I didn't need; which I really appreciate.  He gave me a time frame and quote to take care of the things my car will eventually need to have done.  John gave me a ride back to my office and picked me up when my car was finished.  John was very courteous and friendly.  My overall experience with Carlsbad Auto Service was excellent and their prices appear to be fair.  I will definitely be taking my older Lexus back to them for servicing in the future and will not hesitate to refer them to my friends and family.< /text>

<Review>I took my truck in to get an alignment and ride height adjustment from a local shop in Carlsbad with a computerized alignment machine after replacing the upper and lower control arms, steering center link, and tie rod ends on my 2000 Nissan Frontier.

I dropped the vehicle off at 8:30am.  Stu, the service adviser, quoted me $99.95 for the alignment and an unspecified amount for the ride height adjustment via adjusting the torsion bars in the front suspension.  They were not finished with the vehicle until 5:20pm, 20 minutes after closing.  The mechanic who worked on the vehicle informed the service adviser that I would need to "rotate the tires and tighten the ladder bars" as he was running late for a family matter and "had to go."  Stu called me at approximately 4:15pm and informed me that the final bill would be $225 for all of the work despite the technician still working on the vehicle.  An additional $125 for a ride height adjustment seemed to be a bit steep for the amount of work involved, but I was happy with their willingness to perform the final adjustments as my initial measurements indicated a ride height (ground-to-fender opening) of 28.5" (driver-side) versus 29.25" (passenger-side).  After leaving the shop, I immediately noticed that my truck was still pulling to the right...certainly better that it initially was, but not quite good enough.  I turned right around and headed back to the shop and caught Stu before he left the premises.  He reiterated that the technician suggested that I rotate the tires.  I went home and immediately did as he suggested.  The pulling was corrected to near perfect alignment with that fix.  Furthermore, the new ride height was now even as well.  However, it was now set at 32.375" which left my truck looking a little lifted in the front and not even from front-to-back.

Overall, the only criticism that I would note is that the 1-2 hours worth of work ended up taking the entire day and therefore left the technician feeling slightly rushed to get my truck pushed out at the last minute with further instructions to have me complete the rest of the required work.  I'm happy that my vehicle now drives straight, however, the extra $125 that I was charged for a ride height adjustment will likely need to be redone by either myself or another shop in order to enable a level appearance from front-to-back.

I may return to have this shop perform additional work on my vehicle in the future but might just work to get more clarity on the exact costs involved beforehand and a more accurate time frame of when they would expect to have my vehicle done...or at least arrange to schedule an appointment ahead of time to ensure that my vehicle would have the highest priority after dropping it off.</Review><Rate>4< /Rate>< Resp>

I would recommend this mechanic shop to anyone in the area who is looking for quality, trust worthy, great service. As a son of a mechanic, my whole life I’ve gotten my cars taken care of and paid little to no price. My dad instilled in me that a lot of shops rip people off. But not this shop! They took incredible care of me and delivered QUALITY service. I recommend to anyone in north county! I will come here and send everyone I know here!< /Text>

I would have given it five stars but I had to have my smog test done a second time. If the mechanic had asked me before the first test if my battery had died or been replaced recently, we would only had to run one test. So I had to pay twice.</Text>

{'time': 1597259571255, 'text': 'Jan, We appreciate your choosing Carlsbad Auto Service for your smog inspection and are sorry to read that your vehicle did not pass. Our coupon price is $29.95 which is the amount we charged you for both tests. The only additional charge for the second test was the $8.25 for the smog certificate, therefore the total came to $38.20. As far as the issue with your battery, we are required by the Bureau of Automotive Repair to perform the smog test on the vehicle in the condition that it arrives at our shop in. Being that your vehicle failed and needed a second smog test, we do charge for the second test as the Smog Technician has to go through the entire test again. Therefore, we have to pay our technician for the same amount of time for both tests. We hope this explanation helps to clarify the situation, and we hope to have the pleasure of doing business with you again in the future.'}< /response>

<time>1581792799461</time><review>Very disappointed. I have been taking all my cars to these guys for the last 4yrs. Now I must say they were never the nicest people to begin with but they did good work and they are literally around the corner from my house. I set an appointment to get my smog check which they have done before on this particular car, last year. Today I arrive and they tell me they cannot perform the test on my car because they do not have the right equipment and they dont smog these particular cars.  I told them they did the test on my car last year no problem, which they denied. But they did have my car in their system for a smog previously. Ultimately, they just didn't want to do the 20-30min job. They sent me on my way with "good luck". Very disappointing. I own 8 vehicles and they will not see another one again.<//review><response>{'time': 1582049002428, 'text': "Thanks, Mike, for letting us know about this issue and for your valued business for the past several years.

WOW! From the moment I walked into this place, I was impressed. Everyone was super friendly to me and even my dog who wasn't even with me but in the car.

< Review>
I usually go to dealers to have important work done on my cars. However, I now have a better way to resolve automotive issues. CARLESBAD AUTO SERVICE (CAS). Our relationship started a few years ago when my son was playing hockey for San Diego and had his car here for necessary transportation. We went to the Jeep dealership. We needed tires and felt the brakes were going. They wanted a complete brake job and $700+ for tires. Wedecided to look to other options and went to CAS (they were recommended by many on Nextdoor). The owner examined the brakes and tires. They sold us a set of new tires for a bit over $500, and examined the brakes and told us the front were at 60% and the back at 50%. A far cry from the dealership. So that brings us to now. We had some brake issues (it had been two years). Took it to Jeep, $1600 for brakes ($ 120 for diagnosis).  We remembered Carlsbad and how well they had treated us three years before. We called them got a verbal estimate of a bit under $1000. We took it in and asked them to do the work. Craig and the staff up front were very friendly, cordial, and professional. It was a fun chat. Anyway, they took the keys and the car. I got a call about four hours later as they confirmed the bad brakes on the front, but said the rear brakes were still over 50% and would require minor adjustment. I have a good running and stopping auto now. This was for less than one third of what Jeep wanted. That's a big deal. A good job. Fantastic People. They're my mechanic shop now.</Review>

Honestly the best experience I've had with a mechanic shop! I first took my Ford F150 to the local dealership due to engine noise and they quoted me a very high price so I wanted another opinion. I then took it to Carlsbad Auto Service and they were able to look at my truck that day and called me back with an estimate that was almost 1/3 the price of the dealership. Not only was the price a welcome surprise but Stu from the shop went above and beyond to pickup a wheel lock that I needed without even me asking. It was painless and a pleasure to work with them.< /review>

<Review>Carlsbad Auto Service went above and beyond. From the beginning I met Mike who was awesome in every way. I had tried to fix my car’s transmission on my own and only made things worse. Mike and the team immediately were able to find out what the root of the problem was. Throughout the entire process Mike kept me as much informed as possible on changes with price or parts I needed. Not to mention, this issue was fixed way faster than i expected and their sense of urgency is amazing. I have never had a more stress free interaction with a shop, mike was perfect and from now on I’ll only use them.< /Review>< user_name>

My first visit to Carlsbad Auto Service was outstanding. My air conditioning was out and I suspected it needed an expensive repair, which it turns out it did. But the total $ for diagnostic and repairs was well under the original estimate from Stu at CAS, and most of all, the job was finished nearly 2 hours ahead of schedule, which was important to me on this particular day. I will definitely come to Carlsbad Auto Service again!<//review>

< review>
My truck broke down while I was at work. Being a single female is intimidating enough when it comes to mechanical situations. However.. not only did I have no clue what to do...... Stew took care of me. I don’t feel he took advantage of my lack of knowledge of automobiles. Stew was beyond a wealth of information but also he seemed to really care. I would recommend Carlsbad Auto Service to anyone I know who needs  a honest mechanic. Thank you kindly Stew for all you did and the positive experience.
Sincerely,
Erin S< /review>

I went to a local Honda dealership for normal service. Upon review with my service manager they mentioned that I needed front and rear brakes. I wanted a second opinion so I decided to go to Carlsbad Auto. They gave me their honest opinion and they said that I didn’t need brakes at all. They were at 70%. So I had tons of life left. I would recommend coming here if you are seeking to find truth. Stu did an amazing job letting me me know what I needed to do next. Thx Stu. Will for sure drop the dealership now and come to Carlsbad Auto from now on.<//review>< Time>

My family has been trusting both Mike and Stu for all of our auto care needs the last few years.  We used to take our cars to the dealer, and realized we were getting completely ripped off.  At Carlsbad they treat you like family and never try to sell you on something your car doesn't need.</Review>

<Time>1520898595562< /Time><Rate>1</Rate><text>Stu's attitude when I took my car in for an oil change today was pretty off-putting from the beginning, but hey -- everyone has a bad day.

When I picked my car up there was a list of a few things I should have done, but they never called to suggest them and he didn't mention them at all. Surprised, I asked about the suggested repairs and why they didn't call. His response -- "Well you haven't done anything the last two times we suggested things."

I let him know I only recalled them making a suggestion the last time and they said it could wait. He quickly assured me, "We definitely made suggestions the last two times. I've already pulled up your file."

Well, Stu, good to know you're holding it against me. I'm actually in a financial place where I'd have considered doing some of these things, but not at your shop.

I know I'm not the sharpest with car maintenance and so I want to take my car to a shop that actually cares. Clearly that's not here.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1522866336798, 'text': 'Hi Rachel, I apologize for the delay in contacting you, but I was just made aware of this situation.

<text>Excellent experience, best automotive repair shop I've been to. Came in for my first time today and they quickly helped me get my oil changed, and they also noticed a nail in my tire that he had no idea was there. I did a lot of research before choosing which repair shop I felt like I could trust and I'm grateful to say, I made the right decision with Carlsbad Auto Service. They were extremely helpful, kind, thorough, fast, and most of all, trustworthy. Thanks Mike and Stu and everyone at Carlsbad Auto Service for your exceptional work!< /text>< Pictures>

I just had an oil change, air condition recharge and general wellness check. I had a mystery noise that couldn't be diagnosed and was not charged for that check up. The people are great. I highly recommend this shop. Very reasonable and honest. They suggested some new belts and.a brake inspection based on observations during this  visit so I will be back soon.</Text>

< Review>
In my opinion there's NO other shop to go to for all auto needs than Carlsbad Auto Service.   My wife and family have been going here for many years and we always get a smile and great service.  Stu and the other guys there listen carefully, and will stay in touch with you all the way through your service.

I've even been through two very tough times as my 2nd Lincoln Navigator had an engine freeze up.   They gave me my options and when it was evident that there was nothing to do but replace the engine, the owner was great about allowing me a few days to think about it, then assist me in getting rid of my 1st vehicle, then worked with me on this second one here.

Besides those two cases, I've had pickups, our 'precious' MR2 Spyder and my old 240SX convertible all serviced to perfection there over the years at very reasonable prices, and best of all, no scratches.   They'll treat your car as if it were their  own.   :-)

Thanks guys!

I have been taking my cars to Carlsbad Auto Service for five years. I wouldn't take them anywhere else. The service is always a pleasant experience. They really do a thorough check on the cars and make recommendations when needed. I love how it is a small business in downtown Carlsbad. Very convenient to get to.< /Text>

Stu was great, they got the job done fast and correctly. The cost to have the work done was less than other quotes I had been given for the same job.</Text>

< review>
I gave Carlsbad Auto Service a poor rating because I had a better experience at another repair shop.

I wanted to get an estimate for my truck at Carlsbad Auto Service and I spoke with Greg. Greg was helpful and clear about their policies. It would be $45 dollars for an estimate, which I was fine with.

I left my car with them and the next day, they quoted me a price that I felt was high. So I took my truck to another repair shop and they told me they could fix my problem for about $400 cheaper than Carlsbad Auto Service.

The two repair shops DID NOT diagnose my problem the same. Carlsbad Auto Service pointed out different work I needed to have done on my truck while the other shop only pointed out one. One could argue that I am comparing apples and oranges. However, I will say that I went and did my work with the repair shop that quoted me the cheaper price, and I am very satisfied with the repair they did. If the work that Carlsbad Auto Service said I needed to have done actually needs be done down the line, I will come back and update my review and give this place a better review. But for now, I give this place a poor rating because I found another place to fix my truck for a much lower price.<//review>

Honest accurate and reliable. I showed up 30 minutes early for my appointment and they started working on the vehicle immediately. The work took right around the same amount of time they said it would take. If you've ever had a bad experience with an auto Maintenance place you learn to appreciate the honest ones. I wouldn't hesitate to come back.< /text>

Love this place. They took a little extra time on my initial phone call to ensure I had all the paperwork I would need. Then when I arrived for my SMOG appointment, they took no time at all to get me in and out in literally 15 minutes. Their price was very fair, service was excellent, prompt, and professional. Greg is the man.< /review>

Best auto service around.  It's always hard to find, as they say, an "honest mechanic".  But that is what I feel we've found at Carlsbad Auto Service.

The guys there are always very friendly, they explain everything, and don't try to upsell you on crap you might not need.< /Review>

Fast friendly service. Came in with a 1995 vehicle to get smog test done. They did it quickly and they have they capabilities to fix any problems. Luckily I only needed a new gas cap at this time.</Text>

<time>1445624301828< /time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>Worst experience I've ever had with an autoshop. They not only misdiagnosed my problem but lied about it when I came to pick my car up and said I was actually dealing with a "2-part problem" and offered to repair the second problem for more money. I declined the 2nd repair, then as soon as I drove my car away I realized they hadn't fixed a thing.  I had to bring my car back two more times to fix their mistakes, which they never got right! My car was in worse condition than it was when I first brought it in. All I ever got was a verbal apology. No complimentary repairs were given after I had to bring my car back two more times due to their mistakes.  When I requested compensation back, they refused saying they did the work and I have to pay. In the end, I paid full price for shotty work. Shady and incompetent. Awful awful awful.< /Text>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><review>The first time I went to Carlsbad Auto it was after researching reputable mechanics... after looking for a day or two I decided to take my car to them. I've now been their loyal customer for 5 years, I take all my cars to them and will forever. They don't overcharge, in fact no one does it for less, if they know someone who cn beat their price by even $40 they'll tell you who they are, give you a name, number and address as well as their price. Who does that? I love these guys. Stu, Greg and their team has always treated me well, they're so kind and the work is done right... and quick. They tell me what needs to be done, what should be done and what could be done to be pro-active; and let me decide what work to do. Today I went in and Stu immediately recognized me, smiled and said Hi. He asked how I was doing and I told him I had recently been laid off... he referred me to another vendor who could do the job for $40 less... he actually cared about me and my recent financial chrisis in losing my job. I was so impressed... this was a relatively minor repair (busted passenger window) when I told the other vendor Stu sent me they gave me a $50 referral discount dropping my original estimate from $250 to $150. These guys are amazing and I will never take my car or anyone elses anywhere else ...unless he tells me to ;) Find out for yourself, next time you need something done see what they say first, what's the worst thing that can happen? You save hundreds or thousands of dollars? Awesome. Thanks Guys, You're truly wonderful people.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

{'time': 1528161773240, 'text': 'Randy, The shop that passed your vehicle did so illegally, or they just failed to see the tape repair that you did on the intake boot which is not a proper or accepted repair according to the State of California Star Smog Program or the manufacturer. You can confirm this if you call the local field office of the Bureau of Automotive Repair and speak to a representative at 858-716-1025. My Service Advisor, Mike, tried very hard to locate the part for you but, unfortunately, the only one available was a complete air intake assembly from the dealer. I thought I was very fair to not charge you for the smog test giving you an opportunity to locate a used boot from a wrecking yard and then bringing your vehicle back in so we could do another smog test. We made every effort to accommodate you. The fact remains we did everything correct and followed all the correct procedures according to the State of California Star Smog Program. Wayne Milack, Owner'}</Resp>
<Text>I went in for a smog check Friday and was told the car passed but not the visual test and I need a part for $350.  I took the car to another smog shop and it passed.  I was talking to a friend and he had  a problem at Carlsbad Auto.< /Text><username>Randy Read</username><UserId.>113592944562493268270<//UserId.><Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dc7211067ba747:0x88e0e7d5cca611b2<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went in for a smog, car passes smog emissions, but for the looks portion a valve cover breather hose wasn't hooked all the way on, I could have just plugged it in and went on my way in 30 seconds, but no he wanted to fail me just so I have to come back and re-test for another $50.00</text>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1563575825553, 'text': "Hi Brad, My name is Wayne Milack, and I'm the owner of Carlsbad Auto Service. I read your review and would like to clarify why your Honda failed its smog check. Our technician found that your vehicle had the wrong air filter housing installed. The one your vehicle had on it when the test was performed is for a standard 1.8L engine and possibly an older version of that engine. Your Honda has an Si 2.0L V-TEC high performance engine. The State of California Smog Check Program considers this a tampered emissions failure. Your test report indicates a TAMPER failure. The State of California requires us to test the vehicle as it is when it arrives. If the hose was just not connected to the valve cover, we would have just reinstalled it and entered a no charge repair into our machine and passed your vehicle. We couldn't do that in your case because the wrong air filter housing was installed on your Honda. The state extracts data for passed vehicles, failed vehicles, repaired vehicles and cost of repairs of vehicles from our smog machine database. This information is used to justify that the Smog Check Program is working as designed. We're sorry your vehicle failed, but we did perform the smog test the way we're required to by the State of California."}</resp><gmapID>0x80dc7211067ba747:0x88e0e7d5cca611b2</gmapID></record>

Seems like they downsized the home decor and domestics selection. What they have a nice stuff.  Haven't really shopped the men's clothing department, but seem to be well stocked.  Only negative was at checkout where the cashier decided to lecture me on the divinity I was buying for my husband.  She informed me the first ingredient was sugar, to which I answered, yes that's what divinity is made from.  She then asked if I was trying to giveu husband diabetes.

You get what you pay for at Stein Mart. We got over 10 articles of clothing from sweatpants to polos for $250, which is completely unbeatable. With that being said, some of the zippers have already broken and there’s not a ton of brand name stuff to chose from.

The checkout line moves faster than one could imagine, and the people seem incredibly nice.< /text>

Excellent products. Love this store! Only problem is with their check out line. They need a different system. Every time I'm there people try to go in line at cashiers while people wait in a long line across the aisleway.</Review>

I love this store! I almost always find some fabulous piece of clothing, jewelry, or something for my house.  My go to place for 7Seven jeans, cold shoulder tops, and cute shoes. From career to casual, this is the place! Cool stuff for women and men of a certain age. Designer pieces at discount prices. Shop the sale racks for unbelievable mark downs! Easy return policy and great customer service.< /Review>

Great staff at this location. They helped me with finding a coupon as mine was expired. I was there yesterday and couldn't find what I needed but two salespeople went out of their way to check in storeroom for me. Quality people. TY< /text>

Prices too high! But even if I liked something I would have bought things.  They must have changed buyer for plus size dept. Everything looked soo old fashioned. Not like when I would go and have a hard time deciding...So many options. Then.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><name>Amber Michaels< /name><Review>Found great interview clothes and then got a job and returned for additional work pants at a decent price. I like they have petite clothing so that my purchase was ready to wear without needing alterations. The only negative thing is that the staff that was working the dressing room area swooped up my top and I was left practically walking out the front door in a bra!!! After spending almost $300 on work clothes that day. You'd think they would have given me a $5 defective shirt at least to make up for it!!! But, no...they didn't and it's been almost 3 months and STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY SHIRT BACK. I ASKED WHEN I SHOPPED THERE LAST AND AGAIN THEY COULD NOT LOCATE IT🤔🤔🤔</Review><Date>1524631307916<//Date>< gmapID>

My wife loves this store. On our last vacation we visited all three of them in the Coachella Valley. Next to the College of the Desert Fair this is her favorite place to visit when we vacation in Palm Springs.</Review>

My wife will never shop there again

The Company they use for Credit is a Rip off.

They say they never recieve payments.  My wife  has had to pay $30  to stop Payment.

Now they want her to send a second check,

They need better control< /text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Everytime​ I am visiting this area I come into this Steinmart. It's always clean, and I can find many items I'd love to wear at affordable prices. The only negative is that you really need to pay attention to the sign verbage on the racks. Often it's not a sales price on the whole section, but just in that one arm of the rack. Now I know better, and I read them carefully. I wish I had a Steinmart in the Modesto area!</Review>< Pictures>

I would like the supervisor's contact information for tonight's shift. I would like to talk to them about their employee Greig and how he completely disrespected my wife the entire time she was there. I wonder if they were to allow me to go in with her if he would have felt that brave.</Review>

Thank you dr. bogey, Dr. Hsu, PA katy , nurses Gloria and sandy, and anybody else I forgot thank you. You guys rock!<//Text>

Went for the free outside Covid testing clinic last year. They keep sending me bills every month and final notices when I’ve called billing about 20 times to resolve the issue. Also tried to charge me for a hospital room when I never left my car and tried to miscode things to charge my insurance for. Horrible hospital stay away.<//Text>

They are amazing, polite, funny, and make you feel very comfortable. I’ve had two surgery’s this year and each time was a great experience. I would definitely recommend getting work done here. I really wish I could bring them all food or flowers but with Covid spiking up, I would rather not put anyone at any risk. I hope this review reaches a higher up and can recognize what an amazing team they have there.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Dr. Bogey & my lovely RN Marcelle were among several truly wonderful medical PROFESSIONALS I was so well cared for during my visit.

I have a seriously long medical history
I have serious issues I'm facing.
I could not have hoped for better in a care team❣ From my lab tech who was one of the BEST "sticks" ever ~ painless 🤗!! To the x-ray tech I chatted Darier disease with, all were a pleasure despite off the charts pain & I was a little foggy & confused when I arrived.

They stabilized me, did what I needed to feel better and got me back headed home.

BRILLIANT

< Review>
Some doctors are very unprofessional. When my brother broke his right arm, his doctor joked that it meant I’d have to wipe his ___. I’ve also heard of instances where doctors have harassed women. Professionalism at this hospital leaves a lot to be desired.< /Review>

I had my gallbladder removed at the surgery center on the 14 of May.
The staff was absolutely amazing from the minute I walked in until the moment I rolled out.
They kept me comfortable and relaxed.
Every single person from the front desk to nurses to the Dr. had a smile on there face and were warm and caring.
They kept a cheerful balance and kept me laughing the few hours I spent there.
Thank you thank you thank you to every single one of you. You care and should all know how much you all make a difference in people’s lives.< /review>

My husband and I was just visiting family for the holidays and to our surprise, I was admitted to the ER in the morning of Christmas Eve due to severe pain  that was unmanageable, then sent to emergency surgery shortly after assessment due to my medical illness advancing.

The staff was so pleasant and understanding from admission in the ER, Admission Nurse, ER doctor to OB-GYN Surgeon till the day I was discharged.

THANK YOU TO ALL the Staff that helped me!

<review>Well, we as people know the difference when we are treated right or not treated well. Do you think this Hospital should have been sued in a Court of  Law, (?), when you come in with a Nose bleed that was result of a botched operation by another Doctor from San Jose and you just seen him and while you where traveling to get back to where you reside which is here in Hollister, the packs in your nose slip out do to an onset of bleeding( Hot Day.), Now, have a decision, as had to pull over on 25 in front of Trical and exit Vehicle to clear airway passage and change my sweat shirt as it is soaking with blood, do I go to Hazel Hawkins or Saint Louise(?), question will I make it. Lots of Blood having a hell of a time trying to stop the flow, nothing is working. Decision go to Hazel, closer.
I make it to Hazel, Blood everywhere, as soon as I am taken to a room, passed out. Loss of Blood. Definitely would not have made it to Saint Louise. Would have crashed Vehicle. The ER Doctor, says I have to be transported to San Jose Regional and that in His opinion I did this to myself to get pain Medication. WHAT. This Is California. You can get anything you need if that is what you perfer.
So I tell the ER Doctor I need to go back to where I reside and get my medication for Harvonni as I am on Hep. "C", treatment. He states I will remove the nose packs he placed in and you can leave. Then say's I will call the Cops, Go ahead. He does. The Cops show up. The cops say can not leave. Explain my situation. They say we will put you on a three day pysch hold. Three Cops show up for this enlighten Drama. And not one say's I will go over and get your medication as I even suggested that also.
So after about 3 hours closer to 4, the ambulance shows up and taken to San Jose Regional. No Harvonni. The Other Doctor, Nose Doc, not there. WOW. So it had come to my attention that should have been given a blood transfusion. Did not get my Harvonni until 39 plus hours later.
My Hep "C" treatment failed. Now some of you may find it in that brain of yours to be upset about this post. Let me assure you. If you do. Your a Whack JOB. I am the one who went thru this ordeal and reaped the consequences of it, NOT YOU. So do you think this Hazel Hawkins Hospital should have been SUED IN A COURT OF LAW ?<//review>< pictures>

<review>This is definitely a small town hospital. They do not have the organization to have all the doctors under their one roof.  They have a Clinic a few block's away set aside for the doctors which are new, young and don't seem to be capable of making a dagnosis. Inefficient waste of time, money for both the hospital and the patient.
When I went to the clinic for help, I couldn't receive it due to lack of expertise and equipment.
I ended up at the hospital's emergency  room as I couldn't wait a week or two to get a second xray and go back to the clinic. The hospital was where I would have had to go for the xray's that the doctor couldn't perform at the clinic. First time I have ever been to a clinic so small they couldn't give you the basic test's to diagnose an immediate illness. I would have to give this organization a D for planning and accessibility.
The doctor in the emergency room seemed new, young and while he said he had a doctor to refer with there wasn't a lot of action in the emergency room. It still took me close to 3 hours to get through the system they have in place. That being said, I believe they came out with the correct diagnosis.</review>< UserId.>

<Text>I've lived in 5 different states and this is the worst hospital I've ever been to. Blood on the floor of the room I was put in. Half the doctors think they're better than everyone. They don't have updated equipment. They have VERY low security. The nurses take over 20 minutes to get to you when you call them with the call button.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Shady billing department, Completely lacking. Paid my bill stated I was done, I called 9 months later when was moving to verify I had no bills just to make sure. Same response I was good. Now it's been 9 months from that point so yes almost two years and I'm getting a bill. Cannot express how beyond PISSED I am. Middle of November no less. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and stay on top of them never once was anything mention of anything pending or waiting for approval all that was said was that I had NOTHING. So keep that in mind next time you choose to come to this hospital.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80921d9700b07031:0xe6cab1aec0a0c393</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Horribly mismanaged and slow.   We came in because my wife injured her back.  It was 3PM and the waiting room had only three people in it.   It took 1 hour to see the doctor who asked for x-rays and now here it is 2 hours later and we still have not gotten the x-rays nor seen the doctor again for a prognosis.

Watching the staff it looks like they are all moving at 1/4 speed... then they leave here and all complain that the grocery store is slow or that their pizza was delivered in 27 minutes.

If they are this incompetent during the the slow time... I would not like to see this place after a bus accident.

Save your time and drive to San Jose.</review>< Pics>

<review>I am not pleased with this ER.

Upon checking in, the nurse was asking me health related questions; while very polite, I noticed he was checking boxes without asking me the question first. Such as: have you traveled outside of the country recently. He checked 'no' on that box without even asking me. That is pertinent information that he didn't bother to get, instead he made an assumption.

The other problem is that I was told that I was dehydrated, and that I really needed water to hydrate myself. If this was such a concern to them, why wouldn't they start an IV and give me saline? Or at the very least, not make me wait half an hour to bring me a tiny water bottle?

Another thing I will mention since I'm writing, is that I refused pain meds. Which is completely my right and will not have a negative effect on my health. The nurses would not accept this answer and kept bothering me about it; and not in a polite way. They were very rude about it with a tone of voice that would make you think I was in anaphylaxis refusing epinephrine.

These problems were not the only shortcomings I noticed and paid the price for. I am not at all impressed by this hospital or its staff. I see a need for ethics and customer service training...</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
A heartfelt thank you to Hazel Hazels is too inadequate so I write this.
I was admitted to ER  to see if I was having an MS exacerbation that was the first in 10 years.
Dr Bogie’s  quick kind and thorough diagnostics and immediate staff coordination resulted in a 4 day stay of intensive treatments that arrested a full blown exacerbation and permanent loss of ability to walk and talk.
Dr Herrick, was a medical quarter back who took gentle charge of coordinating care with the most informed, kind, and efficient doctors, nurses, nursing assistants etc that you could imagine. My Nuerologist, Dr Jain, worked hand in hand with Dr Herrick all along the way. Even the dietary management and kitchen team werecso pleased to continue special cooking and food needs .

Claudia Cameroon, inpatient physical therapist, was so informed and her ray of sunshine easily turned negative thoughts to more positive healing ones.
Personable and informed Josh Mercier, Medical Social Worker, offered post relief transportation and many other resources that would be invaluable for future follow- up care and getting medications, and offered to help handle any issues in the future.
I’m so handled....

Thank you for all you kind, informed, timely and humanistic approach to a life-changing moment that could have turned out so differently and affected my life forever. 😘😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😬<//Review>

< Review>
When I broke my leg riding in Hollister Hills, and on my way to the hospital, my friend called the E.R. to make sure they had a wheelchair ready to go. They said they “don’t have any available wheelchairs”... a hospital... with not enough wheelchairs... the waiting room had two other people, I might add.. so “no available wheelchairs” is a very pathetic excuse on their part. How did they expect a girl with a broken leg to walk into the hospital??
This is the ONLY reason they did not receive 5 stars from me.

Once I got called back, which didn’t take very long. EVERY nurse and doctor I talked to in the E.R. was so helpful and always kept a smile on my face despite the pain. I need to take a moment to call out one specific doctor that was by far the BEST doctor I’ve ever met. His name is Michael Bogey. He always managed to keep me laughing, distract me from any pain, and did anything and everything to make sure I was okay. He made sure I knew what signs I would need to look for after I left the hospital. If I could give him 6 stars, I would. He was amazing! If I ever break a bone again, I will gladly drive back to this hospital just to be checked on by him.<//Review>

Yet another horrible encounter. Go in for food poisoning and it’s like they’re trying to say it’s everything but that. The nurse brittney has a horrible attitude. She makes faces n rolls her eyes because she thinks I can’t see her. Don’t take the people you love here, no one will care.</text>

However, this review is in response to a recent visit with one of your doctors, Dr. Al-Hasan.  I have never been so rudely treated and yelled at by a doctor in my life when I was just trying to have a discussion with him about my wife's condition and the horrible pain she is currently going through.  He basically accused of her of being a drug addict and trying to get pain medications and me of trying to question his authority as a doctor when she was just trying to relieve her chronic pain and severe depression after her previous doctor took her off the fentanyl she had been on for 17 years and was the only pain/fibromyalgia medication that had ever worked and would allow her to function despite her never ending pain.  Dr. Al-Hasan should not be allowed to meet with patients.  Such behavior should not be tolerated or acceptable by a doctor representing Hazel Hawkins Hospital.  Thank you for reading my angry, but justified, tirade.
Be Well!

<review>When I 1st moved here the medical staff was great. Now I would never recommend anyone to go here. Last time I was there the medical staff in the E.R. was so uncaring, rude. I laid there all  night never one was I asked if I needed something to eat or drink, & their bedside manner STINKS!< /review>< Time>

<Review>I went to Hazel Hawkins for an ultrasound because my baby was in a weird position and my midwife wanted to get the exact position figured out.  She recommended seeing someone in San Jose but I didn't want to drive that far just for an ultrasound, so I went to Hazel Hawkins because I live within 2 miles of the hospital.  My mistake!  The people at the front desk were friendly but the ultrasound tech was clearly ready to get out of there as soon as possible.  I couldn't see the screen and mentioned it several times but she didn't move it so I could see better. I had to hold my head up and twist to see it the entire time (40 minutes). She pointed out a couple body parts but did it so quickly that I couldn't tell what she was pointing at. When I'd say "I didn't see what you pointed at" she'd act grumpy and point it out again. Or if my husband or I asked "What is that?" she'd answer us like we were stupid. "Ummmmm, it's the PLACENTA?" Had we known we wouldn't have asked, obviously! She only let us see the face for a few seconds. When she was finished I asked if I could see the face one more time and she got it up but again, only for a second or two. If I had blinked I would have missed it. I asked what position it was in and all she would say was "It's head-down." so I said "But is it posterior?" and she didn't know what I meant. She said "What do you mean posterior? It's head-down." So I said "Which way is it facing?" THEN she explained where it was. Every thing we said to her seemed to bother her and she was not at all interested in answering our questions or making it enjoyable.  When I had ultrasounds done for my other babies, the techs were excited and clearly loved their jobs--who wouldn't be excited to be able to see the miracle of life every day and watch expectant parents get to see their baby in the womb for the first time?  Seems like a joyous, fulfilling job to me.  The ultrasound tech at Hazel Hawkins was about as thrilled about her job as the average DMV worker.  The entire process took about 40 minutes but I was ready to leave after about 5 minutes because of her negative attitude.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Lots of sitting and whating.  Then they don't bill your insurname correctly.  Had $1000.00 taken from my tax return out. Of nowhere and now I discover there's a nether a count in collections for over 900.00 after I provided my insurance 3 times and when I call the hospital I get a bissy tone.</Review>

I just went to this clinic SAT there for two hours with my 3 year old was under the impression I had an appointment come to find out some rude lady named Diana who supposed to be in charge came out with attitude and told me I wasn't going to be seen today was not at all nice about it didn't even apologize made it seem like it was my fault and told me. I should have known better I was a walk in none of this was explained to me when I made the appointment over the phone so basically I wasted 2 hours of my time sitting there for no reason I have a wedding next week and I'm so sick she was rude had a chip off your shoulder put your hands up in the air would even let me finish talking all she did was run her mouth and not allow me to explain what I just said right now Ugh, .. so upset</text>

<review>This is definitely not the pharmacy that you're going to want to go to, I know of people who have heard of people who died waiting in the emergency room, but couldn't get any medication from the pharmacy... Unfortunately, this Hospital is going downhill.<//review>< Pictures>

I wouldn't take my dog here. Horrible horrible place!! They airlift a majority of their ER patients out because they're not equipped enough to handle a most injuries or events. If you can handle the drive, go elsewhere. You'll end up having to anyway.</review>

Got a ribeye steak curry and a custard pudding - both were very good.  Nice place to come on a cold rainy day.</text>

<Text>I go to this restaurant often and have always had a good experience here.  They just started a serving a limited time dish, curry ramen, and it is very good. I got the soft shell crab version, but you can choose to get tonkatsu instead. Sadly, they will be closing down this month (06/26/18) due to issues getting their contract renewed. They are asking customers to send feedback to the parent company (curry house usa) to convince them to renew their contract.</Text>< Date>

<GmapID>0x80dcdc5fff776af3:0xcee0a4f4123c9b70</GmapID><Review>This is one of my favorite curry places. I really like the puree style of curry. This place offers large portions for an affordable price. I actually fell in love with a location at Rowland Heights for this same exact chain and went there weekly. Once I found one near me, I couldn't wait to binge here. The interior is average, but the service and food are excellent.< /Review><user_name>Timothy Kim<//user_name>< pics>

One of my coworkers loves curry, so we came here for office lunch.

I've been to this Curry House once before, and I have gone to other branches of the Curry House location as well. Quality is consistent, nothing really to complain about. Katsu pork curry is always a favorite. Just a note is that their spicy isn't really all that spicy, so if you love spicy curry, would definitely ask for hot and then add a spicy sauce that they have on the table to really get that flavor.

Great for if you have a curry craving, but not much else.< /review>

I go to this restaurant at least 2-3 times a week, it is THAT good. I have been a frequent customer here at this location for about 10 years now. I cannot use the proper words to accurately describe HOW DELICIOUS the food is here. All the employees are so sweet and welcoming. My all time favorite is the Menchi Katsu, extra hot. The best food in all of California if not the USA. I just keep coming back. It’s healthy, filling, and energizing. Amazing job Curry House! I’m your #1 fan!!!</review>

My husband and I have been dinning at Curry House since we were teens (that's about ten years). We fell in love with the taste of their curry ever since we found this restaurant, we especially love their hamburger curry. When my husband found out I like Curry House, too, he took me there for our first date, and he proposed to me at Curry House five years later, so we decided to try and ask Curry House to be cater for our wedding even though that's not something they did, and they agreed!!

During the whole process of planning our wedding reception, I realize how humble and kind the people I worked with from Curry House are, that makes me respect this restaurant/company even more. Atsutoshi was the representative of Curry House who coordinated our wedding catering project. He was the one who spent hours planning, discussing with our wedding planner, his manager, chefs, and servers, and visited the venue many times to make sure things go smoothly on our wedding day. Although, meeting and discussing with people were his job, however, knowing that we had a limited budget, he sure made some sacrifice and was working with a diligent heart and humble attitudes, we were so pleased that we can't ask more from them. Atsu worked everything he could to meet our expectations. We weren't worried during the planning, and certainly enjoyed the food on our special day with our guests. We are just too proud to have Curry House doing the catering business for us!<//text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Got their corn pottage soup for $3.  The bowl was half filled and it was a small bowl.  Was worth maybe $1.50 for the bowl.  Got their beef curry, a $10 bowl.  I got 4, 1 inch blocks of meat.  That comes down to about $50/lb.  I emailed corporate about the skimpy portions and they pretty much said they're skimping to keep America thin.  However, they didn't mention anything about bringing down the prices.  So they shrink the portions to help our wastelines because Americans can't control their own portions, but do nothing about helping out our wallets.  How nice of them.<//review></record>

<rate>4< /rate><response>None< /response><name>Tiffany T< /name><Review>I love the food here.   You have to try the gudetama x curry house collaboration before the promotion goes away.  For $29 the meal comes with soup/salad (pick the corn potage as the soup is sweet and very tasty) , keema curry (comes with veggies and ground meat in the curry) pudding and green tea and a hat.  I think their curry is better than Coco ichibana plus the wait time isn't nearly as long.<//Review><userid>106309082498732560791< /userid>< gmapID>

The curry is a little too creamy and rich for my taste. I still prefer CoCoIshibanya over any other curry restaurant.< /text>

This class was great. Was really nervous about driving. But peter the instructor made it easy for me to drive. He is a great instructor, and told me that I was doing good. The lessons are easy and the staff was nice.< /review>

<Text>Very useful driving school, with nice and chill people. I had three two hour lessons with Jason and he was informative and was very encouraging and supportive! I took my drivers test today which was the day after my last lesson and passed with only one error! I would totally recommend this school to everyone and anyone.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>My daughter has had two lessons and only needs one more to complete the course. However, now it appears that they have closed and left my daughter as well as many others in the lurch without any notice or opportunity to get even a portion of the cost back so that my daughter could complete it elsewhere. I am especially suspicious of their sudden closure since we signed up for the course with a “Special Cash Price” they offered us over the phone just a few months prior. They initialed her temporary permit acknowledging that she completed a portion of the required driving hours, but when we called another driving school after they closed and we’re bo longer answering their calls- they said that that will not be sufficient. They are requiring us to get a letter from Central CA Driving School that states how many hours she completed or else we have to pay for the entire class again. They answers their calls for a while. The first time she was with a student. The next time she said she was feeding her husband and then she no longer answered. I am sick to my stomach about this. These kids are so excited to start driving. Some kids have jobs and need to drive. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and am waiting for a call back from Fresno P.D. to see if they can help encourage CCDS to make this right by everybody or face charges of fraud. You can’t just take money for a service and walk away.< /Review><rating>1<//rating>< resp>

Can’t get ahold of everyone from this company. We called and it goes to a full voicemail. We paid for driving lessons and  now we need to schedule them. Went by their location and they had been evicted. Sign on the door referred us to a different company. Bad for business.< /review>

I wish I could give this place 0 stars. THIS PLACE IS A SCAM!!
Apparently they underwent an ownership change recently and are no longer honoring their customers prior to the change. My step daughter cannot receive her last lesson according to DENA because they have "expired". We have already PAID IN FULL for her lessons and only had to postpone her final lesson due to a family illness.
We were just hung up on by DENA after she said either pay $60 (for a so called "missed lesson" that NEVER happened) or show her our phone records to prove that we called to postpone/reschedule the final lesson.
PLEASE, take your business elsewhere. If you don't trust me, look at other recent reviews and you will find similar comments regarding these false charges and unprofessionalism.</Text>

I went to the other driving school that was on there door and he told me this is there 3rd time doing this to people. The owners name is Peter Muna.
They ladys that work with him in the office are his family members. Also there is a form at DMV where you can sue them at least try and get money back.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This the best driving school the instructors are so real with the students instead of hiding behind a professional facade they show they really are human and they put the effort to make sure that the important information is clear and sticks. Jen was the best Drivers Ed teacher because of her brutal honesty and the fact that she knows what she's talking about and her personality is refreshing to see from an instructor. The same goes for Jason as a drivers training instructor. He always keeps the mood light with conversation and doesn't try to drone you with information. I would definetly take my kids here.

<review>I have not had any of my lessons I payed and they called me at 10:00pm at night and rescheduled MY appointment. Very unprofessional calling so late and rescheduling my appointments as well as not even giving me the correct information. They gave me 5150 N. 6th St. went there and everyone who works there had no clue about what I was talking about. Now they have been evicted and they did not leave any information. Does anyone know where there new location is?!< /review></record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>This place moved twice within 6 months. My son had an appointment for his last driving lesson and came in only to find out that the driving school was evicted the week prior. We already paid for the lesson and didn't get notified of anything. Very unprofessional.. Being evicted doesn't make it ok to keep your clients payment and not let them know you are out of business.</Review>< pics>

Jennifer is an amazing teacher who stays relevant to the learning process of driving by not overloading us on random facts that are not congruent with driving. Everything in the class is calm and not at all uncomfortable with a boatload of information that you only remember half of. The teachers aren't hypocrites about such day-to-day lessons such as driving the same way that English teachers get annoying about correct grammar when they speak with LOLs and TTYL. This is my number one recommendation for driver's ed (mainly because the online courses take waaaaaay more that a week to complete).< /Text>

Customer service is great, but bad business practice. I signed up my son, which he finished the ed part, then comes the drivers training, this is something that they must have plan from the beginning. Okay bare with me folks, I am the standard hard working parent, paid for him to go to this school, ed and training of course. They call you to remind you of your driving appointment the night before, which is great, but they leave you a useless unreachable number in case of any changes. Then if you call the main number, youll get 1 of 2 things; a full voicemail so you cant leave a vm and the guy there that speaks forever on the voice system leaving you no room to leave a vm. So what happen my son got really ill during the middle of the night which who knew that will happen. So ive called and called and did research to call them that he wont make it for hus training. But the issue was like i have mentioned, full message and a guy talking forever. This is what happen i finally reached them, which happen to be in the morning when they finally open and turn off their long message and , i told them that my son will not be able to make it so i need to reschedule, which they say, there will be a $60 charge for miss appointment and not notifying them before hand. How can i when they have no means for me to leave a vm. So the guy just say i should have find a better way to reach them when it is not possible. So bad bad business practice to squeeze more money out of a hard working single parent!<//Text>

Never got to experience the actual behind the wheel training so I cannot comment to that, but be careful when they IMMEDIATELY charge your card before you even hang up the phone, because God forbid you may have a family emergency that envelopes your time for a few days, because you will lose your money. The owner is extremely rude and unprofessional. I can't believe they are still in business. Only care about their money, not the child learning to drive.<//Review>

This place is unprofessional and horrible! I paid for my daughters drivers ed and training, when I tried to contact them to schedule an appointment the mail box was full, when I finally reached someone they assured me they were still in business and just moving locations. Just tried to call and all numbers are disconnected!!! Now looks like I’m out all the money I spent!</Text>

Poor customer service and unprofessional staff!! Unfortunately, it is true what they say, you get what you pay for. A word of advice, spend the extra money and take your business to one of the other fine driving schools here in the Fresno area. Not only will it save you time, but a headache as well.

My experience:

I had a 0800am driver's training appointment set up for my son. We showed up at 0745am to the facility and waited until 0845am. No one ever showed up, the doors to the facility remained locked even though signs on the door stated the business opens at 0800am. No phone calls from staff, no signs posted stating why the business was closed, and phone calls to the facility went unanswered. At 0915, I was finally able to reach the receptionist. Her excuse, apparently one of the staff member had taken the company vehicle out for a joy ride without authorization (this speaks volume about the type of staff that are employed at this facility.) All staff are currently busy trying to track down the vehicle from home. The receptionist made it pretty clear to me that my missed appointment was not of a concern to her right now. Her priority right now is finding the vehicle and when she does that they'll deal with me. She then hangs up on me. I called right back and she does the exact same, click!  we'll just end it here and say I'll be getting a full refund.<//review>

The food was good and I could order ir again but it needs some improvement. The orange chicken was as I like it between crispy and soft and that says it was most likely fresh including the chicken. But it needs more orange sauce. It was not dry but not moist and I would like to taste the orange sauce that’s why I ordered this dish. The other thing is that I live 5 mins away and the orange chicken was room temperature and the rice was cold so they need to work or making it hotter. The ice tea was good. I had it with coconut milk. Also, if you order with the restaurant directly you don’t have to pay for the rice as a side.< /review>

My food was ready in less than 10 mins! The food is always hot and steaming when I pick it up - which I love. I'm trying out a vegan diet right now, and it was very easy to accommodate the meal to make it completely vegan. Overall great experience</Review>

I ordered at the wrong location and they wouldn’t give me a refund. Horrible customer service. I even went through the online service like the lady told me and they wouldn’t authorized refund.</text>

<date>1545177108114< /date><review>**new ownership. The food is much different, and, sadly, not nearly as good.**

This is unlike any Thai I have had. The chef is a true chef who knows her ingredients and cooking methods and isn't afraid to try new twists on classic dishes. That said, don't order the basic Pad Thai because you'll miss out on her true skills. Talk to the waitress or chef herself and get a recommendation. The food is amazing!  Bonus: the portions are gigantic, so you will have plenty leftover for another meal!<//review><UserId.>107219418490678871838</UserId.><GmapID>0x80c2c04f70ca8e35:0x4f6b32fc7bd481df< /GmapID><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAA_lN7PlYG1MfEPk6baPtV3Z-9WVheis-ixHZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT0FayaFq1VBVhYBqcgWLnu3sfOmuPeuTuPhTi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoEVz37KbkmJMDi1NPl97Mip1Gfzu8eL6O_ovt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSlKw_VQUBI18gOSAO0eeWzEXkBFGlBndg1GGr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Rating>3< /Rating><user_name>Gabriel Forrey< /user_name>< Resp>

Everything was very tasty, but the service was a little slow for what looked like a quiet day. We had the fried calamari, which was cooked well (not too chewy) and the batter was super crispy. The sweet potato fries were cut as shoestrings, but battered and fried as clumps. Great flavor, but know what you are getting.<//Text>

Food is EXTREMELY good. Your mouth will melt as soon as any pf the dishes touch your mouth. None of the food is overly greased/oiled, there are light and heavy choices, all are tasty. The takeoit is fast, and eating in is also available. I personally reccomend the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai.</review>

I ordered Pad See Ew when they opened at noon. I was hungry so I wanted to eat something good but unfortunately the ingredients weren’t fresh- broccoli was yellow, noodle was mushy, pork was tough, and it was not flavorful at all.. It was very disappointing and still left me hungry...< /text>

Gave this a shot since moving away from Glendale.

You have a better experience and quality of food at Indra or Thai BBQ.  Pad see ew was one of the better dishes, until now.  Bland and they resorted from using Chinese broccoli to regular florets and noodles were "lightly" sauced (I'm use to having it darker).

My favorite was the pork spare ribs because it had a sweet, garlic and fish sauce flavor to it.  This time, it was like I got it from hometown buffet, drenched in regular bbq sauce.

Glad I'm not not missing out since moving.</Text>

The Thai Bruschetta is to die for and the Kinky Kalamari has a crunchy breading as well as a heavenly dipping sauce. The staff are really nice and helpful. The parking is good with generous space. We had the Fried Rice and Pad Z Em. The portions are generous and the price is right. They are willing to put tables together but don’t plan your office party there..for a large group order out. We saw several people stop by and pick up a large order.will be going back again soonest.< /review>< pics>

Friendly service, tasty food, all in a simple cozy location. Never had a bad meal - and many of the dishes are on par with or better than many served in Thai Town. Great place for lunch (well priced specials) dinner, or delivery.<//Review>

The curry tastes like it’s been watered down... a lot. There’s no taste. The chicken in our next dish is very dry and the calamari was soft instead of crispy and extremely salty. Never again. Recheck your chef.</Text>

Friendliest staff ever. The chef will come out to greet you at times and is super proud of their dishes. Their take on traditional Thai cuisine with a cool spin makes this an amazing place to eat.

The sushi options are great as well when the sushi chef is in!<//review>

Basil lemonade was a nice touch, not too sweet and had that great Thai basil thrown in for the final touch.

As someone who is from Glendale and knows good food, Thai Me Upp is amazing. Reminds me of my favorite Thai place in Boystown. Great Chicken Curry and my partner had the noodles and it was delish! Great food, great atmosphere and friendly staff!<//Text>

Great casual atmosphere. Great service. Pad Thai and yellow curry were traditional and good. Chicken sate had an Indian influence and was quite good as well.<//Review>

<Review>Love me some great Thai food!
We were in the mood to have some coconut soup so we decided to try this place out. They have a pretty decent size parking structure that they share with other businesses so you won't have a problem parking.
However if you want to use the restroom, you have to exit the restaurant with a key that they provide and it's located outside the restaurant, corner of the plaza.
It's not the most clean place so don't expect to have 5 star treatment. When we arrived there table next to us was still dirty from the previous customers and it took them a while to clean it. Our table also had some crumbs on it as well which we asked to be cleaned again.
Right when we sat down we ordered: Devil Wings as appetizer, one big order of Tom Kha with chicken and one Pad See Ew with no meat, just veggies.
Which we waited they brought out complimentary shrimp skin which was oily but good.
Not long after our food arrived. The Devil Wings were amazing!! They came with a side of Brussels sprouts and cauliflowers around it which was incredibly delicious. The wings themselves were very juicy and meaty. So amazing. The Tom Kha was wonderful as well. The broth was very delicious and coconuty. There was a lot of chicken in there, more than it should've been. But it still gave it a nice flavor. We ended up leaving a huge chuck of chicken leftover since there was too much of it in there. Lastly, the Pan See Ew with veggies. This was also great. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the veggies were nicely steamed and they came the dish a beautiful color.
Overall the food was amazing, if you can overlook the fact that the bathroom is located outside of the restaurant and the fact that it's not super clean it's a pretty decent place to grab a quick lunch or dinner.< /Review>< Response>

< Review>
Dealership did a total bait and switch. Was working with one of the managers, Brandon, on a deal for a vehicle that he assured me had all the options I wanted. We locked in a price, I got the color I wanted, and then I double checked with him before coming in that it had everything I wanted, and again he assured me it did. I Ubered an hour to the dealership and find out it doesn’t have the options he promised me it had. Then, he said he could find me one with the options I wanted.... but it’ll be more money. What? Or he said I could do a year newer for more money. Total bait and switch. I told him I shouldn’t have to pay for your mistake, especially when we already agreed on a price, and I don’t want to pay more for a vehicle that was supposed to have everything I wanted originally. He wasn’t willing to fix his mistake so I walked away. Very dishonest dealership, would not recommend.</Review>

We made it to Covina Chevy by accident. We were bringing in a Chevy Volt from another dealer for a pre-sale inspection when we spied these two 2014 Sparks. Razi worked with us all afternoon seeing if we could walk away with two cars with our one car budget. It was a complicated afternoon but both cars were in our driveway by 7pm that evening. Bonus points to Razi for bringing Chevy’s sales department all the way to our home in Pasadena so that we could make our appointment to sell our old car, and not have to drive back to Covina to finalize paperwork for our Sparks. A wonderful experience and a big thank you to Covina Chevy for making it all possible!</text>

Jose did what he could to find us a truck that met our needs and within our budget. His manager, Rey, was honest about doing a trade with another dealership, and I really appreciate that. If you know what you want at the right price for the market, I do recommend this dealership.</Review>

<Text>I purchased a brand new camero from this dealership and was promised to have the scratches removed on a later date. Today I brought it in to get the scratches removed. I pointed out the scratches that were on the vehicle and one I made on accident on my front bumper. I told them not to worry about my self made scratch. They went ahead and removed all the scratches to make sure my vehicle as clean as the day I bought it. Love you guys. Stay safe

Ps. You forgot your hair net in my car. Please let me know how to return it to its rightful owner 😁<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtgJcjdfdVP-d_WW6-iR4ut-0FiKwI5aE0XWa-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqCa2elgYfgfP--otfGbU2Unfk_jv_wxY6znnu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf14It-O35qnrVMkEhzVMXlcjhCNaST0PMLd-S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

When we arrived on Saturday to test drive the new 2021 Trailblazer, Jose was ready and told us all about the cool features in our new ride. We fall in love with this suv but needed more time to think about. Jose called on Wednesday about another trailblazer that just had arrived at his location. We had to go see. Long story short, we left that night with our new 2021 Trailblazer. Tyler moved so quick with finance. He explained everything to us about what we were signing and about what we needed to do next. We left Covina Chevrolet with a full tank of gas and freshly washed SUV!

He took the time to explain the features of the vehicle. He was able to answer all my questions. He was honest in that if he did not know the answer to any question I had he quickly looked into it and would provide an answer.

The finance manager, Alex Ruiz, also very friendly and respectful. He explained all the paperwork with ease. He knew his job well and kept the time down to a minimum, with out rushing, That was good. The final paperwork signing is always long and tedious. Mr. Ruiz went through the process accurately and expeditiously.

Over all very happy with Covina Chevrolet, they get a 10</Review>< Pics>

I purchased a pre-owned vehicle here and initially was very happy . The tire pressure monitors were broken and I was told that may cost a few hundred to fix. No problem, but it was 500 to fix. Next, The mykey lock was on enabled(max speed and volume lock for teenagers) and I was told a Ford dealer would disable that for free. False. Turns out I needed the “admin key” and was only given the spare key from Chevy. I needed to purchase a new key to disable the teenager mode I was stuck on. New key was $200. On top of that, labor was an additional $180 to program the key and turn off the mykey mode. $821 down and I informed the salesman I was pretty bummed about it. He said he would help, but needed the manager . Days go by and I follow up 3 times. No luck. No care that I was left with petty repairs on a 30k vehicle just days after purchasing it. Thanks Chevrolet!<//Text>

Recently bought a car from this dealership and 9 days later the alternator broke down.  Now can't even get a conversation from anyone there.
They're all nice when they're hoping you buy a car from them but impossible to get help from them after. Very disappointed in this Chevy dealership. Will never go here again.< /text>

<text>I recently visited this Chevrolet location and it was the best experience I’ve had in an establishment such as this. I was greeted as soon as I stepped foot onto the lot. The sales consultant that helped me is named Luis R. He was very kind, he definitely was incredibly knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in, he was able to answer all my questions without hesitation, great attitude, very upbeat and friendly. The showroom was extremely clean, not a single spec of dust to be found. Overall the atmosphere of this place was very welcoming, very inviting, I definitely felt comfortable while being here. I have been to other locations while looking for a new vehicle and by far this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this location.</text>< Pictures>

<text>This place was the worse .. I did all my paperwork on a car that which I had already been there all day . When done with the paperwork the salesman ask me to redo saying another customer wanted my car since it was the one she test drove which was had a better engine so for doing this they promised me a life time of free oil changes but than sold company to someone else which meant they could honor the oil changes anymore . Not only that they pretend that your credit is bad but never disclosing what it actually is so that u feel hopeless and settle for the interest rate they suggest . So please know credit score if going there . Also, the warranty was over so quickly even with an extension. I felt like these people were scammers from start to finish. I would go to car max or anywhere else over this place.. when paying off your car early you would think it would be lower but for some reason with this place it is not .. don’t make the mistake I made of going there they act like they are on your side but they are not I dealt with a nelson Cruz and manager Michael unsure if still there but they messed it up for me and anyone I know from going back there..</text>< Pictures>

Liked the car we test drove, except for the salesman (Ruben). Told us absolutely nothing about the car and was a bit rude during the test drive. The way he was speaking to us made it seem like we were interrupting his day and taking up his time.</Review>

<Text>BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP!!! THEY HAVE SOME REAL SNAKES WORKING THE LOT!! I got the call that the 2021 Custom Silverado w/ a standard box I had been waiting for a month now had just came in. I called back an hour later to make my walk-in appointment to come in and purchase it. RAY assured me it was there so I made my way. After an HOUR drive there, I come to find out they had already sold it earlier that day. I told the salesman helping that I was just told it was there. He was like sorry about that and I was like why would you tell me it was here and to come down. So I decided to settle for a short box instead since they had a pretty good online price on it of just over $40k. When I told the salesman I wanted that one for the online price, he said that was only  for prior lease customers.  I told him that the price shown does not include the $1500 he is talking about but a Chevy discount all dealers are promoting, he was like NO you gotta read the fine print. I told him I did and I sure as hell know what I'm talking about. I told him I was not going to waste my time and argue with him. So I took off. Today I went online to see if I had missed something about that chevy offer and low and behold! The dealer had changed the price by $5000!! The truck went from $40k+ to $45k+!! The dealer is calling it a market adjustment!! Hahaha EFF THAT!! Now I only think what other kind of F@CKERY tgwy would have tried to get me for if I didn't know the process. They were still going to add some RIDICULOUS dealership fees after the net cost.  Don't be fooled, do your research before making any arrangements anywhere.  That's your hard earned  money we are talking about. In the thousands too!! Stay woke!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c<//GmapID></record>

First and foremost this dealership is amazing.
Luis Ruiz is an amazing person in himself he made my brother and myself feel so confident and comfortable from going to a 2006 Ford Focus into a  new 2021 Chevy Malibu
Highly recommend you all if your looking for a Chevy this is the place to go management and staff very friendly.</Review>

<Review>Worst dealer ever!! They sell you cars that haven't passed safety inspection.  Then they can't offer you an equivalent car. Worst of all they put the blame on you in writing they state unable to verify applicant information.  That's BS. My husband has excellent credit and had been pre approved and couldn't take the car home because the wind shield had a  crack and they were going to replace it and detail the car. When we called to check status they said they couldn't go through with the deal because the car was not safe to sell. When we went in for explanation no one knew anything.  Everyone passing the blame of course. Now I thank God.  Will never buy from them.  Same day we went to Encino and bought a better car.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Terrible Service Department! I've brought my car here numerous times and their customer service portion of the Service department is terrible. They do not offer rentals, and they often will do shuttle to drop you off but will not pick you up when your car is done. DO NOT GO HERE FOR SERVICE - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Puente Hills Chevrolet owns Covina Chevrolet. Pick Sierra Chevrolet in Duarte or Glendora Chevrolet.<//Text>

<Text>Had an amazing experience at Chevrolet of Covina. Luis Ruiz assisted me in not only picking out my vehicle, but also with test driving and financing it within my budget. The ability to accommodate to customer needs (especially during a pandemic) is very admirable.

<text>Nice people and quick service for an oil change and tire rotation. Used an online special to get the price down to make it reasonable. My one issue would be is that they underinflated my tires after rotation or didn't check. All 4 were at or below 29 psi and should had been set at 34. When thw weather got cold i had to do all 4 myself but not big of a deal. Just inconvenient.</text>< Pictures>

I had a great experience yesterday! Before arriving at Covina Chevy and working with Chris Garces  I went to Victorville Chevy on Dos Palmas and had a horrible experience. I called Chris told him what I wanted and about my experience earlier that day. He made sure I was comfortable with the process and got me everything I wanted. He was transparent about the cost of the vehicle, rebates, taxes and fees even before arriving at the dealership. The other dealer was unwilling to give me this information unless I applied for their financing. Chris was very patient with all of my questions, found the vehicle I wanted, gave me cost and walked me through every step of the process.  I asked for transparency and got it. From start to finish I had an awesome experience buying my first Chevy. I would highly recommend Covina Chevy and Chris Garces! Thank you Chris!< /Review>

Great at selling vehicles. Bought my truck a month ago and still can't get my all season floor mats owed to me. I was told they ordered them and they would call when they arrived. Two weeks later with no phone call I went to dealership. I was told they had them, but manager didn't have key to parts dept. Went back next day 1/2 hour later nobody knows how but they are missing. I called for the manager the next 2 days and was told leave a message. 5 days later no phone call no floor mats.  Here is your survey!<//review>

My experience was very smooth. I looked you up online, answered a few questions regarding my vehicle purchase preference and other basic info questions you needed answered then, I submitted my application and in a few hours I had Luis calling me. I must say, Luis was the most pleasant people person. Very clear and patient with my questions and answers. But mostly, sympaththtic to my car needs. I never felt rushed nor overwhelmed with any of the paperwork. Your entire staff and especially Luis and Joseph at W. Covina Chevrolet welcomed me with a big smile and opened arms. They both worked really hard in making it possible for me to bring home my new ("2020 Chevy Spark in black")whom I've nicknamed "Pulgita". I thank you all but especially Luis and Joseph for making what I thought would be impossible, "POSSIBLE"!!!!. I am forever grateful!!.</Review>

Honest Sales staff.
Not pushing trying to make the sale sooner than later
I ended up getting a good discount.

I would defensively be back to by my next car and will recommend Covina Chevrolet to others.<//review>

<Text>First of all and mainly most of all, the customer service that I received at Covina Chevrolet was outstanding. Before arriving at Covina I had just left Chevrolet dealer of puente hills where I was treated with total disrespect and unprofessional personnel. I was so upset when I left puente hills, but thanks to Covina Chevrolet customer services made up for all my disappointments and bad moments. Thanks again!! One more thing I wanted to add is that at end of day the key to customer service satisfaction is how you get treated and Covina Chevrolet has that!!!!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< review>
We brought our 2017 Chevy Cruze in due to check engine light, Stabilitrak light and loss of power. They determined it was a blown piston. Luckily for us it was covered under factory warranty, so after repairs were done we basically have a new car now!  We are very "HAPPY" about that.The technician Roger Bartling kept us informed and was very professional and knowledgeable. We definitely recommend this dealership!<//review>

This is our family's second time buying from here and their staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. We worked with Luis who was super patient with us and made us feel reassured and comfortable about everything we needed to know before purchasing our newest car. I am very happy with our experience here.< /review>

DO NOT SERVICE YOUR VEHICLES HERE. I went into the Covina Chevrolet Dealership on December 23rd for a scheduled 8am for a routine oil change and tire rotation. Upon arrival to the dealership I was helped by a service member who inspected my car before taking my key to begin services. During this inspection NO DAMAGE was reported to the interior of my car when I dropped it off. Roger left a message stating the vehicle was ready for pickup. I returned to the dealership at 10:30am to pick up my car. Once, I arrived home and was out of my car I reached in to grab my purse and realized there was an approximate 1 to 1 1/2 inch cut on the driver seat caused at the Covina Chevrolet Dealership. I promptly drove back and was helped by the same service member. He came out to inspect the damage to my leather seat and said I would have to wait for his service director who was busy at the moment. I waited about 20 minutes for the service director Shaun Burkel. The entire interaction with Mr. Burkel, was horrible and I am still in disbelief at how such an ill mannered and unprofessional individual could be "in charge". At no point did Mr. Burkel attempt to understand or remedy the situation. He immediately began to blame me for the damage asserting that it must be peeling because my car is old and when I sit it somehow "pinches" itself. That is not even remotely possible considering the leather cannot pinch itself as it is to the left of the driver seat. In addition the claim that my car is "old" is widely inaccurate as the vehicle is less than five years old. Mr. Burkel belittled and disregarded the very real concern regarding the damage to my seat caused by one of his employees. He began roughly smashing the seat with his hands in an attempt to show some sort of pinching that he could replicate to illustrate his point. I even sat in the car to show how impossible his claim was. His response was "well as the service director I can tell you I am not accepting responsibility for the damage". He at no point listened to my concerns or the fact that the damage appears to have occurred with a sharp tool (which the service department staff carry), and coincidently appeared after being service. I've attached a picture below to document the damage on my leather seat in which you can clearly see it is a precise and straight cut that looks nothing like peeling or pinching as the service director Shaun tried to say it was. It is very obvious that he tried to steam roll over my concerns because I am a younger woman and did not have his "30 years of experience" that he was so adamant about expressing to me. When I asked for a supervisor or corporate number his response was "there's no one above me, this is it". I find it very hard to believe that there is no one else I could speak with and submit a complaint to. I was forced to contact my parents who the car belongs to only then would he provide them with a corporate number which I had previously asked for and he vehemently refused to give me. He repeatedly said "we're done here" and dismissed the fact his staff damaged my leather car seat. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had and find it extremely unprofessional that he could not take responsibility for damage caused by the service department. It is clear as day that an employee in the service department caused the damage to the driver seat. The damage clearly pictured below is a fine straight cut and not "peeling or pinching" caused over time. As he so adamantly repeated himself in his 30 years experience "cracks" in the leather are normal wear and tear this was not a crack or caused by normal wear and tear but rather a sharp object to one specific area. The initial inspection to my car reported NO DAMAGE to the interior of my car and yet when my car was returned there is obvious damage to my leather seat. (see below) Will be filling complaint with BBB and Chevrolet corporate office.<//review>

My dad and I we’re on the market to get a new work truck for our business we were originally going to CarMax but the truck we wanted to purchase was sold so our back up plan was Covina Chevrolet. The receptionist was friendly and answered all my questions. Mr. Thomas our salesmen made the process extremely smooth! We were there no more than 2 hours which is great! All in all The team down at Covina Chevrolet are great & I highly recommend this dealer.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Great experience!  I was nervous about car buying during COVID, but my car was totaled so I needed a car.  Luis and Katherine were great - responded to my e-mail inquiry within minutes, and then worked with me on the credit app and negotiating price & rates online & by phone.  Then, Luis, Katherine and manager Ray got all the documents ready for my appointment, so I signed everything in 15 minutes - record time!!!

Also, I felt very safe, everyone wearing masks, plastic shields in front of the desks where I had to sign the paperwork, sanitizer stations. Thank you so much!

One negative, Fox News was playing in the lobby.  Please fix this - it's as though you're advertising that the shop is pro-Trump. In normal times, I would walk out and go elsewhere. Maybe try the Discovery Channel or ESPN, or anything else.

Definitely the easiest car buying experience I've ever had!! And I love my new Equinox, it's absolutely perfect!</review>< time>

My 2010 Chevy HHR has been my favorite car I’ve ever owned, and when it began to show troubled signs; I took it in for an inspection. I cannot thank my service associate, Roger, enough for taking all the appropriate measures in looking into the issues of my HHR. He addressed them very professionally and thoroughly, working above and beyond to help me.< /Text>

The entire staff over at Covina Chevrolet is extremely kind and helpful. Special shout out to Luis Ruiz who assisted me with purchasing my vehicle. He was very professional and took the time to show me different options. Would highly recommend to anyone that is looking to purchase a vehicle to contact Luis Ruiz.<//review>

The sales person that sold me the car seemed ok but never followed up with some request we talked about. Never heard from him again and I don’t think he works there anymore. Very disappointing.<//text>

We came in to get an inspection on a car from LA Auto Exchange - where we had a bad experience - and during the time that the car was inspected, we found two used cars that interested us. Razi took us for some test drives and then gave us the hard sell - we didn't take it seriously at first, but then we walked out of there from a bad experience at LA Auto to a good one at Covina Chevy. Razi went out of his way to make us happy, meet our budget and accommodate our needs - big ups to him.

Covina stole us from another dealership and it was great.

I do want to say that I'm not a fan of the Stargard GPS system - they install it on every vehicle and use it as a profit margin technique. I understand dealerships have to make their money, and he did discount it for us but that still kinda sucks. Still, their customer service earned 5 stars!<//text>

<Review>I have really excellent service at Covina Chevy. The receptionist was polite and honest and so was Chris Garses my sales person. Very honest about the vehicle and little to no negotiation needed for great prices. They did everything that they could do and went above and beyond! Recommend this dealership high and will have more business with them. Has a few small issues but dealership is going above and beyond to fixing it. I extremely recommend them. Thank you so much for the 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan</Review>< Name>

<Text>I was just here looking to get into a Camaro and literally was told to come back tomorrow because they get cranky if they don't leave by 9 my husband literally told them we were looking to buy right then and there. I will never be coming back to this place there was a guy Eddie who patiently helped us but by that time the desire to conduct business with them was gone. I understand you are trying to get home but I'm telling you I'm not looking to waste your time and you still don't want my business okay I'll take it elsewhere

Update 7/23/2019 bought a Cadillac great service treated like royalty eager to earn our business. Leasing two more vehicles wasn't looking to waste your time next time learn to help every single customer<//Text></record>

Me and my husband had been looking for a truck for our son after months of looking we finally found one here. I called to ask if they could give me a better price because it did have a lot of miles on it for how old it was and they did but it wasn't enough to get to where we needed it so I said could you do a little better and they said well because there is stargard on it we can't bring the price down it costs 2500 to have it on there. I said what's stargard and they said it's software thats been installed on the truck and my husband asked if they could take it off that we didn't want it and they said no they can't and I said ok well if you guys would come down a little more just do we would be within our budget that would be great.  But they said they couldn't but that they would leave the stargard on it for the lower price! I said awesome well take it! I initially was talking with Razi but he was on his day off when the transaction occurred so I was talking with Rey the finance manager he assured me the truck was in excellent condition.  My husband went down for a test drive and found out that the windshield had to chips out of it and the center counsel had a big hole.  but he drove it anyway and said it drove nicely we made some deals with them to fix the glass and replace the center counsel and they did! I was happy! A couple days later I texted Rey to ask about the stargard he said it takes a couple of weeks to get it transferred i said ok no problem.  So here we are today i texted Ruben who is the guy that delivered the truck to us.  I asked him can you let me know what's going on with the stargard he said yeah let me talk to Rey and I'll get back to you.  I said ok.  I text him a couple hours later and he said he'll have Rey call me. Rey called me alright and all I heard was we didn't charge you for it i said but you weren't suppose to charge us it was in the price of the car and you said it couldn't be Uninstalled. And he said you weren't charged for it! I said I knew this was going to happen.  I said Rey your lying that was not the deal you said it was included in the price and that it would be transferred in 2 weeks he said what are you talking about it can't be transferred.  I said that what you told me he started yelling at me i said please stop yelling at me! And he said you weren't charged so I said that's fine what's the general manager name and he says it while raising his voice and i said thanks and hung up! Whatever you do get everything in writing that you ask for because they are snakes that work here and I will not be taking my business and I will write a review wherever I need to so people know what kind of stuff goes on here!  DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU ARE TOLD FROM REY OR RUBEN THEY ARE CONIVERS! BLATANT LIARS!! I will be going to the better business bureau, Facebook, yelp, consumer affairs and whoever else i have to!!!< /Text>

<Review>We came into Covina Chevy to look at a Hyundai they had on their lot because my Hyundai had been totalled 2 weeks earlier. Jose, the sales person we met with, took his time helping us test drive the Hyundai we were looking at and after I realized that wasn't the car for me he walked the lot to see if there was anything that might interest us. I ended up test driving a used Chevy Equinox, which I had never considered before, but fell in love with it. I even left the dealership to test drive other cars to be sure this was the one for me and Jose was supportive the whole time. I ended up coming back and getting the Chevy Equinox and the process was not difficult at all. I told them what I wanted and they weren't pushy about adding additional items or warranties and it made the experience less stressful. Definitely recommend working with this team!</Review>< Pictures>

Good News.  Amazing Selection, Excellent Prices, and Helpful Staff!

Bad News.  1 Month has passed since I purchase the car and this happens.
I Purchase the car Cash so I know what they're going to say it's not our problem. I contacted Chevy Customer services and they said that someone repainted the car.  Working with my Extended warranty to get this fixed.<//Review>

I truly appreciate the staff at Covina Chevrolet. From the time I walked into the dealer, to the delivery of my truck to my home every person I met or talked to was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. Jose Vasquez helped me find the truck I've always wanted and also went out of his way to deliver it to my home. Jose, Ray, Eddie, contract signing and the front desk team made the process easy and communicated all the information I needed before I arrived at the dealer to make the purchase process easy for me. I look forward to when people ask me about my awesome truck and I get to tell them to see the team at Covina Chevrolet, they'll take care of you! Wishing the team there much success and thank you all for excellent customer service it means a lot.</review>

The Good:

Bought a Malibu Hybrid about a week ago. I had a wonderful experience in sales. Everyone worked with me to get a deal that my wife and I were comfortable with. Even helping with my trade in and being more generous with it's value then other dealers.  I was even given a loaner while my car was in service. I would definitely purchase a vehicle here again.

The Bad:

Now for the bad. While the experience with sales was amazing, service is lacking the same experience. During my delivery prep service discovered that there was a recall and a part was needed. It's been a week now and service hasn't even begun to work on my vehicle. Sales has kept me updated but service has dropped the ball. You would think after a week that my car would have been ready. I guess new customers/sold vehicles are not priority. Once I FINALLY receive my vehicle I will NOT be bringing it back for service and will not recommend anyone visit this location for anything other then sales.<//Text>

Our 2014 Cruze diesel water pump and thermostat went out (under warranty) and we took it here for repairs. This was during the GM strike and parts were unavailable, so our car was with them for 49 days. Which we understood we didn't complain since we had a loner. But once we actually got our car back we were able to drive the car home but unable to start it 2 days later since they failed to charge and maintain the battery and its now dead, there was no coolant in the reservoir, and we were missing the undercarriage cover. We called to complain but were told it was not their responsibility, then we called corporate to complain and were able to get our car towed back to the dealer. Now we are told since the battery is not GM there is nothing they can do and a new one will be at our cost, the coolant was not filled by them which they will now correct and the undercarriage cover needs to be ordered since they are unable to locate it. Now I can understand human error and can understand something being missed but 3 huge errors like this is unacceptable. 1) my car was in their care for over a month and any decent mechanic knows that batteries need to be maintained, 2) we brought them an overheating vehicle with a huge coolant leak and it was returned with no coolant!, and 3) a huge plastic piece was missing from the underside of the car in which they asked us 3 times if we took off. This service department is completely incompetent and once we get our car back we will not be coming back.

Update: Chevy gave us a used battery. For that I'll add another star<//text>

Very disappointed. Found a car I liked, but they wouldn't even try to make the payments affordable. Bought the same car somewhere else for a much better price.< /Text>

Bad customer service and terrible communication. Ray never updated me when vehicle was going to take longer than expected, even after I pointed out I was unhappy with the communication. Date and time vehicle was supposed to be ready changed 3 times and no notification was made each time.<//review>

We had a great experience at Covina Chevrolet thanks to our salesman Christopher Cueva .
Chris and the rest of the employees were very informative & helpful .  We stopped by to check out SUV options and after he showed us a few we decided on the one.   We are happy with our Suburban because there is enough room to fit  8-9 people,   2 kids & 7 adults to be exact and a lot of trunk space which means more family trips</text>

The after sale service is bad! Never received my registration more than 4 months now! And the car plate is expired too. I can’t even drive this car legally. I’ve tried to contact people in the office at least 10 times, but none of them will answer the phone or keep transferring me to different departments! When you go buy a car, you will feel the excellent service here, but once the deal is done, the excellent customer service is gone as well!</text>

Mr. Luis Ruiz was kind, authentic and I genuinely felt he wanted the best for me. He was personable and had a warm disposition.

I have purchased many cars and have dealt w/many salesmen and Mr. Ruiz was by far the most kind, non pushy and did not come off as a salesperson but rather, more like a close friend.

I Will ABSOLUTELY, refer family and friends to your dealership, more specifically, to Mr. Ruiz.

GOD Bless you on all your future endeavors and Thank you for your kindness,

Well, I received calls regarding this service that my car needed, and I was told it was the 1st service and it was free since it was the 1st time that I was going to the dealership. They called me at least 5 times, so I was OK, I'm going to try it since I've been always having problems with the dealerships and I didn't wanted to. So, I went and they charged me and I was like really? and he told me yeah, due to your millage you need to pay, so I did but I'm never coming back since I don't like to be lied to.< /review>

<review>I dealt with Razi, he seemed like a nice guy so I’m not sure if it’s him or the management. I would not recommend doing business with this company the price was listed online as an Out the door price (OTD) then they tried to get me for almost $2000 more. The truck I was interested in was listed just under $24,200 before I contacted them<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<rating>1</rating><review>Overall painfully unpleasant experience, the manager was rude and pushy--talked down to us as being 'sales-y' when we were only trying to be honest and transparent with our budget. All he had to do was tell us he couldn't match what we were looking for, and we would've walked away, there was no need for the condescension and belittlement we experienced. In the end, he accused us of having taken too much of his time and retracted the earlier offer he had made. Eddie, the sales rep we were initially talking to, did try his best and we don't blame him at all...but the manager really ruined our day. Recommend you take your business elsewhere.

Thankfully, Johnny at LA Auto Exchange helped us secure a wonderful deal, all the while being extremely honest and helpful!</review>< Pics>

<review>My wife and I had a wonderful painless experience with Covina Chevrolet. Our salesman Tomas was not only easy to deal with he was very helpful to explain everything so we could understand. I also want to mention Christopher who handled many questions I had on the phone today. He was swift to get back with me and explained that covina would handle my requests immediately. We are very happy with Covina Chevrolet and their employees are top notch.</review>< user_name>

<Review>Visited the dealership on a Sunday morning to look at a 2019 Camaro SS. Was greeted by Hassan who then later after being able to work with me to meet a monthly payment that was doable and much more, I’m very happy to say that I was able to walk out with a 2019 Camaro SS. The car did have some minor dings and scratches, however, the manager made the promise to get them fixed for me w no charge. Overall a great dealership with great staff. Would definitely recommend this dealership and salesman to friends and family.👍🏼 🤙🏼</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Great experience buying from this place compared to other off label dealers. Thomas the sales dealer made the sale easy and navigated me to the right truck for me. As a second time truck buyer I can appreciate when someone takes the time to hear my needs. The service department has also been very good in maintaining my two trucks. I am very happy with their service.</Review>< Pics>

Came in for an oil change and was greeted by Victor the manager here. He’s a great guy and made sure I got the help I needed. The workers here are very nice and helpful. While I was waiting for my oil change to be done I was greeted by Aaron who made sure I was doing okay and if I needed anything. This place is one of the best places to have your car serviced because of the staff is so helpful and they get the job done quick.< /review>

The city of Covina has a problem. I'm not referring to the traffic or polluted air we breathe every day. The problem seems to be a lot more difficult to get rid of.

The problem is Covina Chevrolet.

Covina Chevrolet has become highly skilled at dispensing misery for a premium price. I was not expecting great service, but I never expected to witness such contempt for the customers they serve.

My situation with Covina Chevrolet is miserable and ongoing, but I've discovered that it is far from isolated. There are many other folks like myself who cannot even get a simple phone call.

But this is precisely their company culture. Covina Chevrolet has an 'F' rating with the Better Business Bureau and has been charged by the FTC for truly abhorrent sales practices. They had become so adept at exploiting their most vulnerable customers that they failed to notice when their behaviors had become criminal.

Misbehavior persists, until this day, because they know that many customers are unable to properly articulate their grievances. Such phenomenal managerial arrogance to ignore the basic lessons of decency from the MJL and Sage days.

You, the consumer, have many wonderful options around the San Gabriel Valley for car servicing. Whatever your automobile needs might be, Covina Chevrolet does not have the answer. By supporting their operations, you enable them to continue defrauding the San Gabriel Valley of its sanity.

The market should be cleared for those who can compete with integrity. You have the right to be treated with respect, whether or not you have the capacity to complain.< /text>

Came in looking to pick up some parts I needed for ‘12 Malibu, Eduardo “The Product Genius” approached me with great customer service skills, asking if I had already been helped and offering coffee and/or water. Everyone, from the parts counter, to Roger the Sales Department Manager, were real friendly and provided great service. I really enjoy coming into this location, I’m not even from the area, but It’s not hard to tell when your working with professionals.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>After negotiating price with sales person, I was informed that there was additional cost for dealer added equipment to the tune of $1300. After objecting to this last minute "extra charge" I got a $300 discount. Not happy about it but agreed to go forward with purchase. I asked if I needed to put money down to hold the truck and was told no....they would hold it for me. I was supposed to pick up the truck this morning and was 5 minutes away from dealer when I got a call informing me that the dealer sold the truck to someone else. No one should go through such uncertainty. Dont buy from these busters.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Under New Management!  I was looking to buy a used Chevy Spark. They had one at this dealer. But when I was doing my research, I saw that they had terrible reviews. This is NO LONGER THAT PLACE! The person I first started with, Roger,  was sweet and professional. When I was freaking out about buying a car after having mine for 25 years, he was right there! I went to look at the used car I had picked and when I got there they had a new one for me to test drive. So you figure that is their job, right, to sell new cars! But after the test drive with Andy, who is so funny, and knows his cars, I was in love with it!  They worked so hard to make that car fit into my budget, and it did!!! Edward, the financial manager MADE IT FIT!  He was amazing! Arianna, the woman you sign the papers with was so knowledgeable about everything about the car,  what's covered and how to get all of that done. They work together as an amazing team! The only problem I had was 1/2 my fault, 1/2 theirs. When I bought my first car they did not have Gap Insurance. And in all of my research I did not come across that, so I did not ask for it, and I believe it was just an oversight on their part that they didn't tell me either. So, I had to go back the next day to sign, and Edward had added the insurance, but had gotten my payment even lower! That is just how they roll! :D I am totally in love with my brand new car, and feel safe and secure again. They made this a very good experience for me! I highly recommend!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>We have not purchased a car in years, and I mean years.!   Francisco (sales) was recommended to us and he was patient with our questions and needs.  While waiting for paperwork, several staff personnel were friendly and attentive. And although the car delivery was a bit delayed, Francisco took time to get me familiar with our new car features. We would highly recommend Sage Covina Chevrolet and plan on using Sage for our service needs as well.<//review>< user>

I took my 2017 truck in for an oil change. No oil leaks prior to the visit. I picked it up and noticed oil on my driveway. Took it back to service dept, was told that its "residual oil" and that it was cleaned up. The next day there is still "residual oil" dripping. Busy people like myself don't have time for this bs, no body should have to deal with this ordeal especially when you are paying $145+ for this service.< /Text>

<text>Came in to look at 2016 traverse which was parked In first row of lot. Vehicle was filthy inside. After taking test drive I found out reason why. Dealership really needs to not allow staff to use used vehicles for road trips. I decided to take for a test drive anyways. Maybe to only ask for price reduction, new floor mats, and cleaning with deal. While test driving I started to smell brake fluid from a/c vents. Decided to not but. Beware of used vehicles here. Make sure you are knowledgeable in Chevrolets so called 172 point inspection of CERTIFIED CHEVROLET vehicles. This is second Chevrolet dealer (Rotolo Chevrolet) that I've been to that states their vehicles are inspected but yet both 2016 traverse had issues with brakes.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This company sold me a CRASHED truck they promised me it never been in a accident. The hood and bumper was repainted front grill replace front left finder replace with after marked parts.Windsheild was replaced of rock chip he told me. All the bolts in front end were falling out very dishonest sell guy and team of crooks the bumper paint doesn't even match save your time and tell everyone you know to avoid covina Chevy .If you want to be lied to and ripped off this is the place for you .Please spread the word this place has dishonest employees don't care about you or your safety there just in it for the money .<//Review>

I would honestly look else where for a vehicle after coming here.. I got scammed to say the least.. Was told this Chevy Silverado pick up truck had a clean car fax. When I arrived home from a two hour drive from their stealership.. I notice they used black paint to cover up all the rust located on the frame, control arms, rear diff, leaf springs, drive shaft.. I would highly advise going to rydell Chevy after this.. I even tried talking to the owner of the dealership but supposedly he was never in town to take calls..<//text>

I  recently purchased a 2019 Chevy spark,I really wanted a small car and something I could afford.  Christopher Cuevas Which was a person that showed me the car that let me test drive it  and showed me that it was affordable for me.  He really did take his time and effort to sell me the car he was really polite  and knows how to  communicate.  I didn’t think I was able to take out the car but I did. He made it happen it took some time but sure enough I took out my car and I was very happy and pleased about it.  I would recommend anybody to go to Covina Chevrolet and talk to Christopher Cuevas because I know that he would work with them and give them a car that they can afford and that they would be happy with. I want to thanks Christopher Cuevas  because without him I wouldn’t have this car right now so thank you very much .<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>If I could give less than a star I would - this has been the worst experience of buying a car in all my years of life.  Leased a volt, turned in another lease to the dealer to return to GM for processing.  They never helped me with the clean vehicle stickers, and they never sent in the vehicle return receipt so GM Financial billed me over $500!  I tried like hell to get the dealership to submit the VRR, they never even got back to me after 100 phone calls.  If you deal with this dealership, your in for a huge ride of pain - I warned you!< /text>< rating>

<Text>They are extremely terrible in their service both with customer service and actual service.... I knew I shouldn't have gone here. I was getting a couple parts replaced they quoted me for 2-3 hours.. confirmed by phone prior to my appointment and jn person. I left for 3.5 hours and got s phone call they would need at least another hour or asked me to come back another day. I could not believe that after waiting this long they would just ask me to come back.... if you value your time I would not suggest you come to this dealer.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I've known this place and their reputation for a while, but I still went in there while giving them the benefit of the doubt. They seemed nice enough at first. However, they hired these high school looking kids which are just rude and condescending. Again, thinking they might just be young and inexperienced, I tried to let it go. Unfortunately, their seasoned sales aren't any better. Their slimy, grease sales made me regret not getting my masters in English literature so that I could express my disappointment eloquently.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I bought a new Corvette from Covina Chevrolet back in July. It's been over 3 months and I still haven't received my 2nd key. Eddie has promised over and over that they will get it to me, but it is just lip service. I finally get a call a week ago to come in to pick up the key. Then they call me right back telling me the key is on back order and to ignore the previous call. This dealer is a joke. I gave them so many chances to make it right, but they just don't care.</Review>< Pictures>

He greeted me, gave me specific details on the Camero, and most importantly he listened to my concerns about the vehicle. I will definitely come back for my next car purchase. I highly recommend Joey at Covina Chevrolet. Thank you Joey!<//text>< Pics>

I had the pleasure of working with Mike this past Saturday. I went in to the dealership and within 10 minutes I was already over it and wanted to get out- but Mike came along and totally turned that around. Mike made my visit to the dealership a stress-free one. He was very kind, professional and treated me like family. From the moment he stepped in and took over my inquiry to the time I left with my new truck he made sure I was comfortable and taken care of.<//review>

When I came down the sales manager says our policy is no test drives on Corvette’s. Who would seriously purchase a $100k car without test driving it, a complete waste of time. So I went to Sierra Chevrolet and they let me test drive the car with my wife no issues, Sergio was great and the entire staff was pleasure to work with. I drove home with my Z06 and will continue to do business with them in th future.

Don’t waste your time with Covina Chevrolet!  Go to another dealer that value their potential customers.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

My 2014 Chevy Malibu LTZ was performing well until it reached roughly 90k Miles. I have a consecutive history with maintenance at Firestone until I started experiencing engine failure after Eco Stop would engage. With numerous returns to Firestone & them renting me a car, they could not find the issue & recommended I take it to the dealer. Due to my research there is over 140k Malibu's that have known Eco Stop issue; however, GM only posted a Service Bulletin & not a recall (for an unknown reason) to take it on case by case basis. Chevy Forums (which I recommend anyone with a problem in your GM vehicle to look at) other Chevy Malibu consumer's stated similar issues with no help from the Dealer/Manufacturer. Typical wheel & deal on minor repairs but never a conclusion to the issue leaving them stuck.

For the record, I drive at least 4 hours each day from SGV to Beverly Hills. Each time the vehicle was taken in, it was driven no more than 10 miles each time as a test to determine "problem fixed" when I specifically stated the problem only persists when the vehicle has been operating for long period of time.
I proceed to take it to Chevy where they ran a diagnostic & it came back clean as expected since Firestone said the same thing, thankfully at no charge shout out to Kyle. I shared all of the previous information of my problem and knowledge prior to submitting the vehicle. I was recommended to get a new battery because mine was "not good" but they could not provide record explaining how/why because the tech just recommended it, $450 okay , scheduled next visit & done. Problem still occurred within the same day of picking up the vehicle after battery replacement. Returned vehicle & was told their was a Software Calibration Update, $160 just for diagnostic fee Okay, done. Problem still occurred within same day of picking up the vehicle, returned next day & had a tech jump in the car with me to experience the problem first hand since it just happened to me down the road. The problem occurred & the tech understood the issue, possibly. This time they provided a loaner for up to a week or so, thankfully shout out to Berge. I was eventually told they found the problem and it was a concluded loose ground wire G401 they secured it & whatever else at no charge.
If that was the issue why wasn't it found sooner by the Chevy tech or Firestone?
Why did no codes register throughout each testing?
Why did I have to buy a battery or software calibration update?
or Whom was slacking on their job? It seems it whatever the problem is, is being overlooked multiple times with no conclusion.

Picked up the car 4/11 and the car within 1 hour still had the same problem but this time would not start back up right away which has never happened before. I returned the vehicle and they now have provided me another loaner and waiting for a response.

I understand these may be normal manufacturer repair practices; however, there comes a point where there needs to be an ultimate decision that the vehicle has bad technology as also reported by many other consumers in the marketplace around the nation. I appreciate the hard work & consistent service from the gentleman at Covina Chevy; however, this has been an inconvenient burden from supposedly the most reliable car company.
I proceeded to open a manufacturer buy-back case which hopefully lead to an easier conclusion.

update 6/10/2019

After a moment of time the Eco-Stop Feature seems to have been repaired in my vehicle for now. The apparent problem that they concluded and fixed, thank god for insurance has not happened again. They were even gracious enough to cover my deductible & refund me additionally $140 for the labor done in the past.

Took some time to get there but if you are politely assertive I understand that Oscar the Service Director will take care of you within a reasonable manner. I appreciate the teams effort and consistency on this matter.</Text>

Went to Covina Chevy to buy a Corvette, but David was too much of a condescending crybaby for me to justify giving him the commission, so I bought my car somewhere else (car pictured below). If you want to have a good car buying experience and not deal with condescending attitudes like that of David, Vanessa, and the financing director who acted like he was too busy to even introduce himself to someone buying a $65,000 car, go someplace else.< /text>

<text>Service department is terrible, unhelpful and not friendly. I brought my Malibu in for the check engine light being on back in July. They kept my car for 3 days and no one even looked at it. I brought it back in yesterday, and my warranty had expired. I wasn't about to pay $160 to have them keep it and not look at it again. I even took it to 2 other mechanics that gave me the codes that were coming up needing service. I basically did the job for them and wanted these specific codes fixed. I know the department manager, Ray, recognized me this second time coming in. His response was that they still had to charge me to do the diagnostic even though I already knew the problem. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. And their service department needs extensive training on customer service.<//text>< Rating>

After thinking of buying my first car for quiet some time now, I finally decided to do it! My dad recommended we go to Sage Covina, so we did & i'm glad we did. Hector (salesman) was so helpful from the moment we arrived. Showed us a few cars, compared prices, until I finally saw one that really caught my eye. We had a certain price in mind & Charlie (Finance) made everything possible for us to get a great deal. Every one there was so nice & professional.  After a few hours of paper work, I drove home on my new car. I would really recommend Sage Covina Chevrolet, you wont regret it.< /Review>

If I could give zero stars I would, they don't deserve any!
I tried to return/extend a leased car on behalf of my sister who is not in the area. First visit, They told me that I cannot extend the lease of the car. was also told that they do not accept lease return . I went there after a long drive to find out that I had to return to grab my other car key that I forgot to bring. Second visit, went there again and was told that they do not inspect the car. I asked if I was able to return the car in place of my sister they said "yes". Third visit, I came the next week after getting it inspected and they said that I could NOT return it on behalf of my sister, and I asked again if I can extend the lease, they said I can do it through the gm financial.  The sales manager was very unfriendly was not helpful at all. Did not listen to what I say or try to understand my situation. Talked back with a higher tone instead of listening. I called GM financial and found out that I could extend the lease. GM said that the car is grounded already and I can't extend the lease because of that. I still DRIVE the car, but the system says that the car is GROUNDED.  I called the dealer and spoke with the sales manager again and was told that I could not UNGROUND the car. I had to explain with a very high tone and volume for him to listen, and he said that I had to got to the dealer and write him a check before he unground it for me. Then he said he was joking. NOT funny, I told him that they were very inconsistent, and he just shut the phone on me, did not care to listen to what I have to say. Apparently they jut want your money, and does not care to help you at all.</Text><UserId.>112746613859410654346</UserId.>< rate>

Bad service, they never answer the phone, the manager never wants to speak to fix the problem. They have my registration, being told that the corporate office has it, then they say they lost it, now they won’t answer my phone. They’re giving a different story all the time. Seems that every one I talk to is new and don’t know what going on. Really eveyday they have new employees. Is this the kind of service they offer. If you think of buying here. Think twice. Finance department, sales department to manager, worst service ever. Wouldn’t recommend nobody to this place.</Review>

Xander, my sales representative,  was great. Kept in contact and was helpful throughout the process and the main reason that I traveled over an hour to visit Covina Chevrolet.  My biggest issue was the fact that I repeatedly stated that I did not want any add-ons, including maintenance, extended warranty, or anything else in the deal.  The GM repeatedly ignored those requests and I had to continue to request the deal not include them.  After all that, and waiting over an hour just to be seen by the financial department, I discovered, yet again, that add-ons were included resulting in the whole contract having to be re-written.  I arrived at the dealership at 4:30pm and didn't leave until 9pm.  I was accompanied by my wife and 3 children, who were forced to stay in the car for nearly two hours waiting for the financial transaction to be completed.  Needless to say, I was disappointed and furious at the deceptive business practices that undermined my confidence in the dealership, and wasted my time.<//review>

I went here for my first oil change on my Equinox. No one came out to greet me like they do at other locations. The price I paid wasn't bad as it included a tire rotation because it was on special. But their normal prices are awful and very expensive. I had to wait for 2 hours for my oil change even though I had an appointment, they didn't do a car wash, vacuum or anything. When you come to a dealership for something, it should be standard as I've owned other cars in the past and they gave full service and included everything I mentioned. I will just stick with our family mechanic as this dealership is not competitive enough.<//review>

Hit a pothole on 210.  Had blowout.  Called and they told me it was covered under warranty.  Got towed there. They told me it wasn't covered by warranty and would not honor what was told on phone.  Then told me I had to buy same brand tire or when I returned car at end of lease I would have to replace it.  Quoted me $212 for that tire and told me that I would have to wait 3 hours to get it from warehouse.  I called my Chevy dealer in Burbank who told me that was not true either.  Found a good tire dealer, Trojan, around corner who got me same size tire with 50,000 mile warranty for $112.  Drive on flat around corner and Trojan replaced my bad tire in under 15 minutes, have me friendly service and told me the truth.</Text>

Since I didn't buy the Chevy Volt from the Covina location, they assisted me  sonce I live in Covina but gave me appointments two weeks apart which dragged the problem and finding the solution took about 6 weeks later. I had to travel to Huntington Beach to get the new charging cable for my vehicle since the one with the vehicle was defective.<//review>

I had a great experience here in Sage Covina Chevrolet with both David (Sales Associate) and Jose (Finances). They helped me out as much as possible and gave me a great deal on my first car. When i left the dealership with my car, it felt great to finally buy a 0 mile car, but what felt better was the financial help that came after. Jose from finances had already set up a contract for me to take out the car, and it was pretty decent, only to get a call from later that he had founf a better one, so i rushed back to the dealership and signed a new more affordable contract just like that. Ive already recommended over 5 people to this dealer, it was honestly the best experience ive ever had.</text>

I initially spoke praises of Sage Chevrolet service but in light of recent events the review I posted must change.

On January 19 I dropped off the vehicle to have the last free oil change performed as well as a recall service for an AC component. The vehicle was supposed to be completed the next day. After not hearing from the dealership I called them around 2pm to check on the status of the vehicle. At that time they told me they found the threads for the drain plug, on the oil pan to be stripped. They found this when removing the plug. This is awefully suspicious as that problem shouldn't be happening on a new truck. Also, it sounds like someone stripped the threads on the last oil change (don't by them) and didn't raise any flags or take action. I was told that I would be put on a loaner car list but wouldn't know for a few days when I would get one. Furthermore no ETA was available on the replacement oil pan. A few days past and I finally got notified that I would be given a loaner car (Monday the 23). All of this is great except the fact I got a Chevy Cruz and really needed a truck (like the truck I turned in for service). A total of three weeks past before I took back possessions of my vehicle. When I got the vehicle back I found a creak/click on the steering when returning it to center from a left turn. I just called the dealer as the clicking noise hasn't gone away to bring the truck in for service. They said they don't have the time to diagnose the problem and wouldn't for 5-7 days.

I'm taking my business elsewhere and I feel you should too.< /review>

Predatory Price Gougers

Know everything about the car and deal you want before heading in here. If you don't, they will take you for every dime you have with no hesitation. Their first offer on a 22k car was $700 a month over 72 mo. They told me it was a great deal. As someone who worked in financing I knew how ridiculous the deal was and got up to walk out. They persuaded me to stay and gave me 3 more offers before offering a payment that was even on the edges of acceptability. They told me every time that it was a great deal.

On top of that, they consistently tried to avoid the negotiation on the sticker price that was already ridiculously high. It was a struggle to start that discussion before the financing discussion and it took a long time to get them to start talking.

I entered the dealer at 4:30PM and left at 12:30AM . The negotiation took that long. After having the used car for two days I noticed there were no floor mats, the tires on the front and rear were different manufacturers, and there were spots worked over with touch up paint. When I contacted the sales person he said, "As Is." They did absolutely nothing to show they were interested in the welfare of their costumers. From offering ludicrous financing to no post customer help they were horrible. I received my tags and licenses today and I was elated to take their registration sticker from my windshield.

For anyone looking to purchase a car, look elsewhere. This dealers business practices are far beyond the typical predatory nature of most car dealerships.

*They didn't smog the used vehicle and two months after purchase notified me to drive 40 mi to them from where I work and live so that they could finish the registration process. When I showed up they sent me to a local gas station instead of handling it themselves.</Review>

Horrible experience at this dealership.  Please go to a different Chevy Dealership as this is not worth your time or headache.  I'd give less stars if I could!

Went there tonight to check out the Volt and Bolt.  The salesman "Enrique" came out and asked if we were there to see anyone specific, I said no, you.  He introduced himself and that was about it.  I told him I was interested in a Volt or Bolt as my car was totaled last week and I needed a car this weekend.

We liked the silver volt, but the white was open so he had us check that out.  Finally I asked can I turn it on to see the features; he said he would get the key but we asked for the key for the car we were interested in.  FInally he came back out with the key and we went on a short test drive.  He was not familiar with the car or the features, even though he said he just bought one recently.  He wasn't able to answer my questions and when I asked him to tell me about the car, he didn't know what to say.  I said tell me why I should buy it!  It was awkward.

Once we got back to the lot I was looking at the sticker for the features and discussed briefly.  I said it didn't blow my socks off so I'm interested in seeing what else was available.

We walked to other cars and were looking when he just walked away from us and went inside.  We watched him walk through the building and then pace inside completely ignoring us.  I opened and sat in a few other cars that I would have been interested in driving and knowing more about but we had no salesperson.  He never said he was walking away, would be back, or asked if we wanted to see anything else.  He just left and never came back.

Finally after standing around dumbfounded for a bit another salesman came out and asked if we needed help (yet he was inside and saw us dealing with Enrique).  We said we didn't know what happened as Enrique just left us out there without any explanation or help.  I again said I just settled my insurance claim and am looking to get into a car right away but since it appears they don't want to sell one we would just take our business elsewhere.

What a horrible experience!  I have bought many cars and have NEVER been treated or felt this way at a dealership.

I will take my business elsewhere and NEVER deal with a SAGE dealership again!< /Review>

Was helped by joe he said he was not a salesman but had a specific job title.  From helping me right away getting me to test drive and get a  feel for the car I do not think I would have purchased a car from Chevrolet Covina if it wasn’t for joe’s assisatance.</review>

I recently purchased the Volt and they promised me it qualifies for the state incentive, but when I applied it did not.  They straight up LIIIEEEEED to me in order to sell me the car, and when I found out that it doesn't they REFUSE to help me and just told me to talk to my tax accountant.  The incentive is a REBATE and has nothing to do with taxes, so this shows that the dealership is COMPLETELY CLUELESS and willing to say whatever to sell a car.  DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!!!</text>< user_id>

<review>This car dealership is horrible. They have poor service and the employees are unprofessional  .I took my car for a simple oil change and it took them 5 hours to change it. Not only did it take them forever to make the simple oil change but they also made me wait for a month ,for some recoil parts and during this time I continuously called them asking about the parts and all they said was that they were waiting in the parts, in the end they never got the parts So I decided to take my car to another dealership and it took this dealer a few hours to replace the recoil parts. I wouldn't recommend this dealer to anyone at all.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Had a great  experience there.  Nelson walked me through all the trucks and options i was interested in and guided me into the perfect truck.  Then Mike Reed made sure i got a great deal. Then when the Dennis in the finance department took over the deal got even better. Making sure i got all the rebates, extended warranties, and great financing.     When my freind was considering a new truck I took him to Sage Chevy "just to look", the next thing I know is he's rolling out in a new top of the line High Country Silverado!
I don't usually write reviews because very few are worth my time to write. Its was nice to have that kind of customer service so it's well deserved</Review>

<review>Very disappointing experience. Dishonest people, unfortunately.
I bought a used car less than a month ago and 10 days ago the transmission started acting weird and I also found out two of motor mounts were broken. So I took the car back to get it fixed based on the 30 days warranty that I was told the car had when I was purchasing the car. When I got there they said that the car was sold 'AS IS'...." What!!!!!??" I said how come you said 30 days warranty.... They kept my car for three days and when I went to pick up the car I found out that they had done nothing. They said they didn't change the mounts cause they thought it was a part that wears out.
I was gonna take my cousin cause he wanted to buy a car but I am not gonna recommend this to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
This is the worst dealership i have ever been to. I went with My sister to buy her first car in March she was approved with 250 down and low payment we called in 4 different times to re write contracts. The employees kept loosing our paycheck stubs. Vanessa was rude and condescending. Ray was very rude on the phone and threatening in text messages. So after 4 contracts and approvals we were notified we actually weren't approved 1 week before we thought we would be making our first payment. Now my sister who is a nursing student and works full time will be catching the bus because they ran her credit so much her score dropped 113 points and she can't get a car until we can get her score back up. This is the worst experience ever we were both in tears.<//Review>

Horrible.We were quoted prices on the Trax LS & LT. We there, drove the car then went inside. I asked the manager (Mike, I believe), to confirm the prices that we were quoted. I asked 5 different times & got no answer - he kept avoiding the question.  He passed us to the general manager who, after 3 additional requests for a price, refused to provide one.  His response was "Give me more time" but we had been at the dealer nearly 2 hours & I had been trying to get a starting price for at least 30 minutes. I figured they wouldn't honor the prices quoted on the phone & were trying to do damage control. Rather than acknowledging that & either apologizing or trying come up with a solution they kept BS-ing; to what end?  My final statement was "give me a price or we're done" & the manager said "we're done". We left. 3 hours of my life wasted on complete dishonesty.</text>

To start off I would like to say thank you to Maria Guerrero the Internet service manager and her supervisor Melissa and a big thank you to the finance manager for ahnusty. My wife recently got into a car accident on Thursday the 25th of August and we both agreed since we can't wait for the insurance to cut us our check for the total loss that we go and try to get another car. I called and spoke to Melissa explained our situation and she said come in we will help you out. I get there Maria was patient with us and we got a couple of cars we were interested in and we first fell in love with a Honda we went threw the process and the finance manager came to us and was ahnust and told us it was in a accident and the manager before didn't write that down and he wouldn't feel rt to sell my wife and I are car knowing that we have kids. So he said he has a 2016 chevy malibu that will fit out price range we test drove it and we fell in love with it and with the finance managers deal he got us and Maria being patient and helping us all day we got the deal made.. Thank you so much sage you guys rock</review>

Amy Trejos (BDC agent) sounds sweet on the phone but never return my email nor the call she promised, so I called her back and left her my cell phone <again> to ask her to call me back no mater what the deal will be (good or bad).   Waited whole night and checked my email every 30 minutes, nothing.

Decided to get hold of her the next day and asked her about the call she promised from the night before, gave me BS excuses as they don't allow her to dial out after 8pm (this business closes at 10pm) and blame the manager still working on the numbers....  and confirmed my number again with another promise to return my call after 15 minutes.

Anyway, you know how it ends... no calls....    and no trust again ...

By the way, if you do want to visit this place; make sure you talk to one person and one person only Bobby the sales manager.  He is super Cool !!!  and best of luck.....<//text>

<GmapID>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c<//GmapID><review>I have shopped all over for a particular Silverado and when I found Covina Chevrolet it was by chance.  When I showed up, the salesperson, Maria was very nice and easy on the eyes but her boss, Bobby Velto, was the information highway.  1st off, he introduces himself as a lot porter, I know otherwise, we chuckled and he started in asking me 100 questions, ranging from what my needs are to how much I will be towing to how often and everywhere in between.  When it came down to it, he found exactly the truck I needed and wanted.  He even recommended to me that I don't go with the Hi Country that I originally thought I wanted, but to go with the LTZ.  Thank you Bobby, I needed dark interior and the Hi Country only comes with light interior.  Also I didn't need 4x4 like I thought I did.  Maria took me for a nice drive, when we got back, Bobby was waiting with water and the numbers I was looking for.  I drove out in a new LTZ Silverado and will gladly send people to Covina Chevrolet and to see Maria and Bobby.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>115162792986715877611< /user_id></record>
