This place is horrible. Open showers, dirty bathrooms, food trucks, Shopette lines are ridiculously long and you'll wait for sure about 45 minutes in some cases. I'd rather go back to Iraq. It was cold as hell when I went to the box and the OC's didn't let us grab our cold weather gear. It was awful. Be ready to bring everything with you while you're fighting OPFOR specially when it's winter time. Fortunately time flights fast and you'll be out of here before you even know it. I recommend you hiding your phone though. Just use it in case of an emergency because remember you're literally alone in the desert.<//review>

I joined the Army to keep myself out of prison, ironically ended up in what looks like a general security prison with forced labor. This place drained every ounce of fear i may have had of ever going to a regular prison 5/5 star training facility.< /review>

Was there 3 times, '82 to '85 for Artillery exercises. Once in summer and once in winter. Don't remember which season for third. Tent city was boring. In the field, not so bad. Saw scorpion, snake. Very windy in winter. Broke a butterfly spreader for camouflage net.< /review>

I trained at Ft. Irwin with Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (Havoc Troop) 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment in the fall of 1994.  The 1st few days in tent city were boring, but the field exercises, training and simulated combat were outstanding.</Text>

<Review>The Army's premier training center for Brigade sized mechanized and heavy infantry movements and maneuvers. Tent city includes insulation and air conditioning, latrines were fine, but the PX shopette was completely overrun and not capable of handling 4000+ soldiers. It was always packed and ridiculously long lines.

Units never bring enough water, so make sure to buy a case of water each day and load up on at a months supply of baby wipes and field supplies before heading to the 'box'. The heat and sun and brutal, it's literally the Mojave desert and temperatures reach well over 100 degrees, no shade anywhere to be found, plus a 40 degree drop in temperature overnight.

The base itself is beautiful, great California style base housing and apartments, plenty of MWR facilities and a brand new hospital. The scenery is surreal, breathtaking mountains and dune type sands. The main PX is relatively smaller but well stocked and organized. Everything is within about a mile walking distance from the NTC Rotational Unit barracks area.

All in all, great memories here.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Just got back, after 5 days on training. Drove the HEMMT Wrecker and PLS supplying water to showers and kitchens in the desert. Great experiences. Make sure to carry lots of snacks, movies in an IPad and as many warm clothes as u can get.  Terrible place to be for long but I liked it. Also has some beautiful scenes, remember to enjoy them.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

My having served a 2 yr deployment as an OPFOR medic in Irwin 04-06,  my advice is to, maintain your game soldiers.  Attention to detail, teamwork is the key,  use this opportunity to save up money.  You will have everything you need to get by.  Although the field rotations can be taxing, they are lessons leaned you can apply toward your future careers.  In addition use the doggone gym, and maximize the resources from the library on post by living simply, saving up your LES's for future investments, you can make the most of your time at the sandbox hooah.

<review>Looking back, I loved this post. Better mounted maneuver training than you'll get anywhere else in the Army. The OPTEMPO sucks, so its tough for families while you're out in the box. Almost always sunny- hot but dry so its not bad. The post itself is austere, but pretty nice. Its got all the necessities- good housing, a nice town center (two starbucks!), some decent restaurants (pizza hut, subway, BK, KFC, the usual PX restaurants and Sam Adams), and some really nice parks for the kids. That being said, its a long way from everything else- so once again, it's hard on families. Though you're along way from everything- your within driving distance to some great vacations- San Diego (2-3 hrs), Las Vegas (2-3 hrs), San Francisco (maybe 6-7 hours), Yosemite (6-8 hours), LA (3 hrs), Big Bear (2 hrs)... etc.

If given the opportunity, I'd go back.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

In terms of training our Army and other services, Fort Irwin is an exceptional location.  There are not many places in the US where a brigade-sized unit can conduct training.  This is the place where all the individual and unit training culminates in preparation to continue on to combat missions.  The National Training Center and Fort Irwin are uniquely equipped to help unit better improve themselves.

As for being stationed here, you are in a gated community at the end of the worlds longest cul-de-sac.  You are over 30 miles from the nearest "civilization" in Barstow, but most will bypass Barstow to go to Victorville for most of their needs not provided on the post itself.  Fort Irwin does have a fairly nice PX and Commissary, and housing has seen drastic, positive changes the past 10 years.  Homes are a tad small, but are very nice.  I think most families that are stationed here actually like it.  If you are single, you will probably have issues, but hey, Vegas is only 3 hours away.<//text>

I go this laundry mat often since it closest. I go at night usually to run my nitro rc in the empty parking lot. Never had issues. You get your share of weirdos here n there but security has improved on managing that over time. Plenty room sit kids down n free wifi till 11 i believe. Plus you go during store hours plenty to do to pass time with local market a skip n hop away.  They got vending machines but also a little market for gallons of soap etc. Overall ok if you got lil thug in you. Lol<//Text>

<text>Horrible place to do laundry. First the machine broke down and the person that supervised the place did not do anything about it just keep saying to let it run till the cycle ends, but it never did. Then another guy had to come open the machine to take my clothes out
and didn’t even return my money. This place steals from you if you let it.</text></record>

<Review>Well they got rid of all the tweekers and rift raft hanging out all over the place. And got security.

Was putting off the review on this place its a nice place ever since the remolding even has ample parking as well as snack & laundromat supplies machines apart from a new lil corner mart that sells supplies. However the customer service leaves alot to be desired, now on to to the equipment. By now its simply blatant disregard of proper maintenance and upkeep of most machines of the 3 loads an under, they have this smell to it (you can tell in some machines right away) however those which you can't end up leaving this persistent lingering smell which didnt come off easily</review>

Humid like no body's business. Half arsed wash jobs unless you use the $4 machines. Semi affordable laundry products. This place got me through the worst of times so I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The washing machine only took out hot water and I put it in cold! Check the water temperature. It can damage dark clothes. Garbage from washing machines always comes out hot water when you put it in cold

La lavadora solo saco agua caliente y yo le puse en frio! Chequeen la temperatura del agua . Puede dańar las ropa obscura. Basura de lavadoras siempre  sale agua caliente cuando la pones  en frio<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Lately the service at night I did not like very much they cover the machines to a yes there are too many people,
And the last experience (TODAY, AUGUST 22, 2020) they told me that if I was in a hurry I should go to another laundry,
instead of leaving the covered ones to wear,

I HOPE THE SERVICE WILL BE SOLVED SOON BEFORE LOSS OF MORE CUSTOMERS.

Última mente el sérvicio por la noche no me a gustado mucho tapan las máquinas a un si ay demasiada gente,
Y la última experiencia ( HOY 22 DE AGOSTO 2020 )me dijeron que si tenía mucha prisa me fuera a otra lavandería,
en vez de dejar usar las tapadas,

ESPERO SOLUCIONEN PRONTO EL SERVICIO ANTES DE PERDIDAS DE MAS CLIENTELA.< /text>

Best local beach in town, you will have to walk a little since there are no public parking, but worth it when the downtown beaches are packed. Keep in mind that you will get some oil on your feet from the oil rigs near by<//review>

I actually wasn't on Sands Beach but just adjacent to it riding my mtn bike at Ellwood Preserve. Now that is fun! Beautiful hiking, biking kind of place. Go, you'll really enjoy!< /Review>

Great beach, one of the most consistent breaks. Downside is they’ve blocked off most the beach because of a bird that lives there. So you can’t use a ball and can’t use a large portion of the beach. Kind of lame< /Text>

Depends what you're looking for.  The beach is nice (though you might pick up some tar if you're walking for a while) and the water and waves are both nice.  Great place to surf or sunbathe.
However!  There are tons of rocks as you start going out into the water.  I'd say less ideal for wading or swimming.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I love this place. It's not always the cleanest, but usually doesn't have much kelp and stuff washed onto the beach. It's great to take a stroll past the Plover sanctuary and enjoy seeing wildlife.

Please, if you visit, don't disturb the dunes. This is a very sensitive nesting ground for the endangered Western Snowy Plover.<//text>< username>

Nice beach that is usually not overly crowded.  Also a decent surf spot if the time is right.  Just watch out for the random oil spots on the beach and in the water.<//Text>

Everytime I end up here is another time I can chalk up  as a piece of well spent chalk written on the board of memories from my life I hope to never forget.  The cliff wall is really something to look out on in either direction and in all of its crumbling away glory as a reminder to who calls the shots on this planet; man or ocean.   I'll put my money on ocean -< /review>

Horrible customer service. Very unprofessional, cursing all the time and on his cell phone all the time while short answering customers. Keeping customers waiting and promising them a certain time when vehicle will be ready and it takes much longer than promised. DO NOT come here.</review>

<Review>If “NO STARS” was an option. That’s what I would rate them. I went in tonight for a ballast and homeboy tried charging me $100 🤣🤣. I know I’m a female but I’m not dumb. I grew up working on cars and they tried to over charge me. Never again will I go there OR recommend anyone. A ballast only costs around $25. 🤦🏼‍♀️

Man. I’ll be laughing the whole way home tonight 🤣

Oh! && They don’t actually close at 8pm either. They leave any time between 7pm-7:30pm.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>These guys did a great job on my 2016 dodge ram!!! If you do your research you'll see that most of the 1 star reviewers accounts only have a single posting. Smells a little fishy to me and haters are always going to hate. As for my experience they saved me money by not selling me equipment I really didn't need. I price compared with amazon and buying my items through them would be cheaper than online. The salesman took his time to answer all my questions and made sure I would be happy with my selection. Their stereo installer is a mad scientist/genius and adjusted my system to the music I listen to. I've never been to a store that does that before. I was soo impressed with audio masters after they installed my subs and amp I ended up buying more stuff from them. I'm glad I didn't go off of all those fake 1 star reviews and went somewhere else. I'm sure I would have ending up spending way more money with bad service. Thanks again audio masters!!!< /Review><time>1490715823263< /time>< GmapID>

<text>TERRIBLE!! Got my sound system and window tint done there about 2 years ago. My window tint has faded and they are barely tinted and the wiring on my sound system is so cheaply done. Already have had 2 wires fail on me and am looking at a new amp because of it. I DO NOT recommend this place. Yes it's cheap but you get what you pay for.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Called and asked a simple question. The guy who answered didn't know for sure and said "let me check with the boss". The boss CLEARLY yelled "if anyone asks, I'm not here" Guess he doesn't remember how phones work. FYI this place has an F with the BBB<//text>

<Review>The current rating, along with the reviews speak for itself. The place is shady as hell. Bought a stereo system with installation, speakers vkew out & turned out to be used. Not even gonna bother going back there, don't even wanna argue with these crackheads. Just gonna report them to the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Other than that, hope this place goes out of business & never scams anyone else.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

<review>Audio masters has very poor customer service, the employee Omar pockets your money and don't give receipts, the guy that installs the equipment have no idea what he's doing, when you confront them they act like they don't know what your talking about, I would'nt recommend anybody to go to this place.<//review><Rate>1< /Rate>< user_id>

However, I wanted an alarm with power relay (turn manual locks into automatic locks) for my 2005 Silverado. Got a cheaper price there than anywhere else I called, & aside from having to go back the next day to finish the job (which doesn't bother me at all), I'd say I'm pretty happy with the service, prices, & no nonsense approach. They could've ripped me off easily, but they were very reasonable & willing to assist me. The actual alarm was installed in less than 30 minutes. I'm definitely going to make my way back there for more "extras" to be installed. Thanks Audio Masters!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

If only a negative rating was an option... This place had me camped out for 7 hours.. I only stayed because originally the wait time was 2.5 hours... Then increased gradually... and the “help” argued with me he had to take his mandated 1 hour break.. there’s a lot more</review>

Peter is one of the workers at this establishment.  He is definitely unreliable and can't be trusted and furthermore doesn't deserve his job. He is very underhanded and will attempt to steal your money (if you let him). I know from experience. Don't let it happen to you.</review>

Andy was nice and the price was actually very reasonable compared to other places. I've had my lambo doors for about 4 months now and I love them! The only issue (and this wasn't a problem for me) was the length it took to install them. I dropped it off in the morning and it took until after they closed. However, they were committed to completing the job and making sure I left with my vehicle even though they had to close. I say that's great customer service!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>107374712539915911804<//userid><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

Went in to get 5 windows tinted on a truck.  Came out 3.5 hours later with only 3 windows half decentely installed, my property searched through, & items stolen.  I was the only one there since it was raining(over $400 in professional tools).

Manager not ontop of anything.  Promised me 2hrs which should be enough by over 1/2hr.  Never came back to update me on any delays.
Made me over an hour late to pick up my kids from practice.

I filed a compliant with viper already & BBB.</review>< Pics>

do not do business with this company.  my daughter had her window fixed and instead of fixing it they broke the rear view mirror.  she now has 2 windows that don't work, they lied to her face by telling her they did work when in fact they didn't.  They refused to give her the keys until she paid them an additional amount.  This company does not know what they are doing. they are in the business of ripping people off.  i'm reporting them to the better business bureau and to the new stations.<//review>

I went there to get a window tint and over the phone they told me 80 dollars but when I got there they said 100. They told me that It was only going to take a hour it really took 3 hours they were yelling at a customer because the guy had told there that the install was wrong with is car then one of the guy was pulling a customer car to the back of the shop and driving crazy with there car when I got home I realized that the window tint was bad and my car had damages done to it that was not there when I dropped it off I'm going to contact my lawyer to what can I do. I will never go there again</Text>

I normally dont write reviews but the service was SOOO BAD i had to share...I bought a 100 gift card from this place as a Christmas gift for my father. When he went in to redeem the gift card to get his windows tinted he was told they will not honor the card. They told me and my father that we could have just gotten the card from somewhere else and said we probably didnt pay for the giftcard. I explained my gift card was purchased there. The "manager" then started yelling at my elderly father saying we never bought a gift card and said they will up the price 50 more dollars for window tint than previously offered. Reluctantly, my dad was at his wits end and said fine. They fixed windows and we left. Came back to store 1 hr later with my receipt and suspiciously the "manager" was gone for the day. Dont go here unless you want to be ripped off. This place needs to close down.< /Text>

stole my tool kit and my GPS navigator, and ruined my rear window defroster in the tinting process, refused to do anything about it.

I know what you're thinking, believe me I know. just some guy with bad mojo ranting in reviews... no, they did a great job with 2 installs and tinting on 4 other windows (no bubbles, perfect cuts!)

don't do business unless you've removed EVERYTHING from your car that isn't bolted or welded down. this includes pennies in your cup holders.< /review>

Worst customer service.. the guy in the counter has the worst attitude and does not know how to talk to customers to save his life...
See for your self and just looking at they will make you say "who hired this guy?" Either he hates his job or doesn't realize he is hurting the business he is helping .. he needs to be replaced .< /text>

Terrible, terrible experience.

I went to replace 2 of my tires. After I get called to pick up my car, I drive home, and I notice that the low pressure tire signal is on. I examine my tires and notice that one of my wheels (the one that was supposed to replaced) is completely deflated, they replaced only ONE tire (as opposed to two), and they did not re-cap 3 of my tire air caps. I returned the next day so they could complete the job I paid them to do initially, wasting my time, with no offer of compensation/discount.

The name Nono is befitting; I would not recommend going back.< /review>

The best mechanic in Santa Monica

My car broke down and I wouldn't have wished it to break down anywhere else!
Friendly service, efficient work, and reasonably priced.
They do all kinds of work on many different types of cars.
I would recommend for anyone in need of any type of car maintenance.
Ask to speak with Tevin he'll take real good care of you!< /review>

I hate dealing with car issues, but I'm glad I found this place. The people here are so nice, and the price seems more affordable than other places. My car molding fell out, and the guy didn't even charge me anything even though I said I would pay for the service!</review>

<Review>Went in to get an oil change/tire rotation/full inspection. I had mentioned to them prior to dropping the car off that the oil level was alarmingly low. Without charging me any extra, Tevin explained to me that they would keep the car an extra day to do a deeper inspection to find if I had an oil leak and where it was. They even used some fancy UV additive in the oil paired with a blacklight, and found 3 areas where I had oil leaking! And on top of that, used a detergent to clean some sludge that had built up as a result of the car running with low/bad oil.

Tevin showed me pictures of what he had found on my car, and made the necessary recommendations on what needed to be replaced, and kept the cost low for me. I felt confident that he was honest with me, and did the best he could to give me a good deal, and help me understand what was going on every step of the way. They even fixed a funny noise one of my wheels had started making. Overall, very knowledgeable and honest staff, what more could you ask for?< /Review><rating>5</rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

They did the smog test in much less time than many other localities, plus they were easier to find and had easier access.  Done before I read even a short chapter in my book.  Very good.<//review>

<review>Staff that knows what the are Doing.
From when we take one of our cars to Nonos to when the service is complete, it is a friendly and helpful experience.
Greeted by the service manager who will tell you the cost and when the car will be ready, the service is top tier.
The car is ready on time and everything is complete when you pick it up with no surprises.
They always tell you what work you need done and most important they are honest. That's hard to find these days.
Thanks, Nonos.

The people who work here are rock stars! I didn't realize I had a flat tire on my rental car until these guys swooped in and saved the day. They changed the spare and got me back on the road in minutes--faster than AAA! Years ago I brought my old Jeep here for repairs, but that was so long ago, I can't imagine anybody remembers me. I guess they're just that nice! I'm still in awe that there are kind and helpful people left in a city as big as LA. Going to repair places is never fun if you lack knowledge about cars, but I would not hesistate to bring them my business in the future. Thank you!< /Text>

Nono’s Is a great local service station. The check oil light came on in my car. I got busy and days went by. I drove to Nono’s and Brian was at the counter. He was nice, kind, helpful and had no problem fitting me in for what I thought would end up being a complete service. 5 minutes later her came back and said you just need an oil change, but we’ll check everything to be sure. Less ten 25 minutes and Brian was back again. Your car is ready. I paid and was in my car in less then 30 minutes.

Never underestimate that quality of a local gas station. This is my “Go to” place from now on. Thanks Brian.

<Text>Worst customer experience I've ever seen. I went here to get air in my tires... they wouldn't give me free air with the purchase of gas like they're supposed to, and then when I asked the cashier to split a bill so I could get quarters for the machine she kept ignoring me and moving on to customers behind me. The pump doesn't stay on long enough to fill all 4 tires so I was only able to fill up 2 in the end; I didn't want to deal with that cashier any longer.< /Text>< Name>

<Review>I have always felt extremely well-taken-care-of by Coco and crew. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about cars. But with two cars now, they have given me solid advice, reasonable prices, - and told me when work could wait vs. when it could not. I really trust these guys!< /Review></record>

I highly recommend Nono's 76. I moved nearby and had no idea where to go when my car needed service, and with that came the fear of unknown mechanics working on my beloved Mazda 3. I called AAA and they gave me a list of recommended mechanics in my area. I picked this one and never looked back. Coco, the guy you usually talk to when you bring you car in, is great. He's always given me a competitive deal, better than dealerships, and he takes time to understand the issue and explain the technical stuff when you ask. This place doesn't spend all their money on a luxurious waiting room with 3 plasma TVs etc, it's cozy and modest so you're just paying less to fix your car instead of more to have a massage chair and martini machine while you're waiting. Honesty, great prices and fast, great service!< /text>

Nono's service is always very good.  They listen to the issue and are very responsive in fixing the problem. Also, they encourage taking conservative approaches to fixing things -- we have old cars and they help us keep them working!< /review>

<Review>My experience was great, I live close so I was able to leave my car with CoCo and his team. Great service, friendly to work with, and not pushy about additional work. Because the gas station is open 24/7, I ended up picking my car up at 11pm with no issues.< /Review>< username>

​DO NOT GET YOUR SMOG CHECK HERE.  The person, I think his name was Joe, who does the smog will find something wrong and make your check engine light come on by disconnecting a sensor or using his smog computer to wipe out your computer information.  Then he will say to you he will easily fix it for a some amount of money like he is going to do you a favor and then he will tell you to pay him directly.  BEAWARE OF THE SMOG TECHNICIANS. They are crooks< /Review>

While Brian, Coco and Fari are as nice as can be, please think twice about leaving you car here for repairs. After my car being in their possession for a month I am forced to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well as the Bureau of Automotive Repair.
Albeit long, here is my story.

They have had my car for 4 weeks now for a repair to pass smog. Against my knowing, they are having it repaired by another shop.

Brought my 1991 VW Vanagon in to Nono's 76 to have it smogged on Sept 8. Was told it will take 25 minutes. 45 minutes later I noticed that people that have come in after me are leaving. Turns out the machine my car was on was bad. Asked the tech about it and he yelled at me and my wife. After an hour and a half, car is done and failed smog.

Upholstery and interior is filthy with grease. Am given a coupon for a car wash.

I am assured by Fari (the supervisor) that they have an expert mechanic who is great with VW vans and that Fari himself had one and has experience working on them. Left it there that day and requested an oil change since it was there anyway. Called to inquire 2 days later and am told that it is done but something has happened during the process that has made the van run poorly. Am asked to test drive it and see for myself. Drive it home and keep it overnight. Car has very little power and is stalling out. Bring it back the next day and talk to Coco who tells me that they weren't even the ones who did the repairs. Ask who did them and he tells me he'll find out. Also tells me that something shorted out while the new catalytic converter was being welded in. They forgot to do the oil change.

Call a couple days later and find out that the car is over at Kartek Mufflers and they are the ones who are working on it. Call a couple times more and speak to Coco who tells me it's not done yet. He eventually hands me back over to Fari who says that Kartek needs an air flow meter and can't find one. Asks me to check to see if I can find one. He might have a lead on a used one. Give him 2 places that have them. 2 days later he tells me they are out of stock. I call that day and find out that that is not true. Fari says that he told his clerk to order it and that's what he told him.

Stop off at Kartek and get their side of the story. Eddie at Kartek tells me that nothing shorted out while they were welding and he just needs the new air flow meter and the car will be fine. Part comes in and I call to see when the van is ready. Eddie tells me that it's done but not running great (which it was when I dropped it off - Drove to San Diego and back without a problem) I take it home for the weekend and the same problem exists. Car has a bit more power but is now hesitating and surging. Stalls again. Bring it back to Eddie and he tells me that he didn't have time to make the needed adjustments on the new air flow meter and wants to call the company where it was purchased to make sure the adjustments won't void the warranty. It is now 3 weeks later.

Call Eddie on Oct 1 (Mind you I have no agreement with Eddie at Kartek to do any repairs. If it were up to me I would have brought it to my VW specialist). Eddie tells me the mechanic who was working on it has not been at work all week because his dog was sick. I am assured that the mechanic is back and will be working on my van and it will be ready on Friday. Call on Friday and am told that they were very busy and that he will definitely have it done on Saturday. Call 3 times on Saturday and am eventually told that they did not get to it and it will be ready on Monday.

Called Fari and explain the situation to him and tell him I'm filing a complaint since I did not authorize this 3rd party to work on the car and after almost 1 month I do not have it. I am seeking a refund to 1. Pay for my rental car for the last month and 2. to pay for my personal mechanic to fix the problem.< /Text>

<review>This place is terrible. I had to wait an hour just to get a haircut and they attended customers that came after I arrived. One of the employees brought their kid and that kid was loud and misbehaved. My haircut came out decent. Overall, don't bother coming here. Go somewhere better<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I was nervous coming to this place just cuz i never like trying new barbers but i had to because i moved near this location. I asked for a detailed under cut fade with shaved sides. I must say the barber nailed it. She did better than my personal barber lol. Highly recommend, they know what theyre doing. Pros.</text>

DO NOT GO HERE! Rude and horrible service. If you don't speak Spanish be prepared for the woman in there to talk about you without you knowing. If I could give them negative stars I would.< /review>

<Text>Just went in for a haircut. The worst haircut I've EVER HAD! I went back and got a refund because there was no way they could fix it. I guess it's true what they say, "you get what you pay for it".< /Text></record>

<Text>I’m hard pressed to give any location a one star review but Lighthouse managed to hit that threshold.  Despite being branded as specializing in coffee, they have seemingly no variety in beans, roast, or tasting notes to choose from.  The drink prices, other than a basic coffee or tea, are roughly 20% more than you would pay at a Starbucks, and their food prices are astronomically high.  I made it just inside my front door before their travel cup gave out leaving me with a lovely mess and very little coffee to try; it wasn’t special.  The second piece of my order was intended to be a chai latte, however it ended up being, as far as I can tell, a hot chocolate.  Pretty much a total strikeout.

Sorry guys, but I’d pass.</Text>< pics>

The bagels and cream cheese are good but the coffee is watered down So I don’t get my coffee there but I would recommend that the management goes around to different coffee houses in checks to see with the competition is doing. I would ask management to put more coffee in their mixes when they do their regular coffee blends. If others share my perspective please provide input so that we can get this coffeehouse to provide the best coffee for the neighborhood</Review>

Formerly known as, The Good Cup, this cafe got a full on flip my house renovation and it looks good! New owners, new interior, new everything as of 2018. They even carry the town's best local espresso here, Handlebar Coffee, and pastries from the same bakery Handlebar uses. It's now a very beachy, communal style environment with strong wifi, a few scattered outlet options, booths, tables and out door patio seating. The bathrooms are a breath of fresh air too, which, if you knew Good Cup before, is really the cherry on top of this cafe renovation.

While in town I visited a handful of times trying their cucumber toast, oat milk latte, and acái bowls. All a few cents more than I would like to spend but well worth the purchases, would 100% recommend, and will be back for more! Handlebar Coffee, in and of itself, is a gem and the fact that there's a venue on the Mesa that carries it now just raised property values significantly, in my opinion! It's a must try, and oat milk is the best cream to combo it with.

The staff here are all so sweet and hardworking! They make a point to remember so many customer's names and keep things personable in a professional manner. They are super knowledgable on the brand and get things done in a prompt manner. I have nothing but great things to say about the food, drinks, and staff here. Oh and they're pet friendly (outside) so there's usually really awesome dogs hanging out nearby.

The parking lot seems to always have some construction going on and is definitely not ideal to find a spot quickly around lunch or dinner time. Lazy Acres, the amazing grocery store, is right across the lot + CVS and a hair salon are right next door the the cafe. Lighthouse brings a well fitting, super chill vibe to the Mesa in a modern fashion that fits the community perfectly and is well worth a visit.<//text>

Great coffee, breakfast foods (muffins, pastries, yogurt and acai bowls, and breakfast sandwiches). Pricey, but in accordance for the area.< /Review>

Terrible drinks, didn't finish 3.5 oz  of it. 2 oat milk Gibraltars. Steamed way too hot, extraction was watered down and overextracted, maybe something like 1 to 3 or more. They were quite busy so they may not care but just trying to provide some constructive feedback.</Text>

Cucumber toast is legit. And their coffee is basically the same quality as Starbucks.  Good outdoor seating for pandemic.  Wifi good.  Nowhere to plug in though.....<//text>

The atmosphere is perfect- great for conversation or some productive work- the coffee delicious, and the food incredible. I had an almond croissant one morning, and I've honestly been day dreaming about their avocado toast ever since I had it the second day.  Definitely will stop back next time I visit, wish we had a place even half as good in my town.</text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

New favorite coffee shop! The atmosphere is great for studying or catching up with some friends. There are plenty of tables inside and a few outside, but the place can get pretty packed. If you need an outlet to charge, I'd recommend grabbing a table along the wall. There's a very clean bathroom inside, which is a huge perk if you plan to stay here for a few hours!

I've tried their Iced Chai with Almond Milk, Iced Latte with Almond Milk, and Cucumber Toast. All were delicious and I love that they have a variety of non-dairy milk options (soy, almond, oat). They also have a case of pastries featuring some local artisanal donuts from Hook and Press!

One thing to keep in mind if you're trying to reduce your single-use plastic: bring your own cup for all iced drinks! Unfortunately, they only have plastic cups which they use for "for here" orders. The smallest size for the iced drinks is 16oz, so make sure to bring a large enough cup. I brought my own cup the second time I came and saved $0.25!!! Save money and save the earth while sipping on some delicious drinks :)</Review>

Great lattes and a wide selection of pastries from Renaud's and Hook & Press. They also have other food items on their menu. Friendly staff. The space has a great feel to it - very open, light, and airy. Outdoor seating also available.< /review>

<review>We stayed here for just one night on our anniversary.   This is a charming boutique hotel just a block away from the main shopping areas  and restaurants in Solvang.  The owners of the hotel also own the Coquelicot winery in Los Olivos and we were please to receive a complementary bottle of wine in our room along with a coupon for a free wine tasting at their winery in Los Olivos, just 15 minutes away from the hotel.   We took advantage of the free wine tasting which was well worth the trip to Los Olivos.   Highly recommend making the trip.   There a many wineries and tasting rooms and the town itself is very quaint.   All in all, a wonderful, romantic stay and we enjoyed the hotel.   The only complaint is that our room was above the restaurant and they were playing music at 7 am which I think is too early.   The walls are pretty thin so you can here music and people talking in the restaurant at night too, but things were quiet after 10 PM.   No big deal.< /review>< response>

Beautiful! It was so cute and staff was really nice. You get complimentary wine when you arrive to your room. My fiance loved it. The fireplace made the room cozy when it was chilly early mornings and late nights.< /Text>

We enjoyed our stay, the staff is very friendly and helpful, taking every precaution to ensure our stay was a safe one. Our room was very clean, comfortable and cozy with a lovely fireplace. There is "First and Oak" the Michelin stared restaurant on site which is very convenient after walking through the village all day, you definitely want to make reservations. It is perfectly located and in the heart of all the action which was nice. You can hear people in the surrounding rooms as well as in the lobby, but everything quiets down in the evening. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and our stay here was a cherry on top. We would highly recommend this great little spot and look forward to staying again.</review>

Great sunny evening in Central CA. Nice table on the outdoor patio.
Both the Sommelier and our Server were great.
The food was great! Appetizers were unique and tasty.
Everyone (4) enjoyed their dish, Scallops, Lamb, and Duck, and Wine.
Like they say, you don't get a lot of food but you do get good quality food that is very satisfying.
Definitely a place to try again.<//Text>

<Review>Came.here for a nice dinner while in Solvang. This place is just amazing. Great wine selection and the food is fabulous. The duck wings along with the fried kimchi will not disappoint. We had duck for dinner as well.  We would highly recommend the restaurant. We will be coming back and will also look to stay at the Inn.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>This is a very pretty property with a wonderful location. It is right down the street from all the shops/restaurants/tasting rooms in Solvang. Their First and Oak restaurant located on the property was delicious and definitely worth a reservation. The perks of the wine bottle in the room and the free wine tasting in Los Olivos was awesome. The staff was friendly, and the bed was very comfortable. That being said, there were definitely issues. First of all, in this time of Covid, we were told we would have our temperature taken on arrival and be given our own hand sanitizer. Upon arrival, I only had to answer two questions, both asking if I've been to China lately. Really? The room was spacious, and had a lot of room to put a mini fridge, a coffee maker, but it had neither one of those items. We had to go downstairs to get coffee in the morning. I drink hot lemon water in the mornings instead of coffee. They could give us hot water, but even though they have a restaurant attached to them, they couldn't give me a lemon. They also gave out two pastries every morning, but it was the same pastry all 3 mornings, and if you don't like fruit in the middle of your pastry like me, you didn't get anything you would like. There was no guide to the tv, or the town. The walls are thin, and the people above us had a toddler running around at 6 am. No bathroom counter space and little hot water for the shower at times. The bathroom needs a renovation, the ceiling heater is very scary.<//text><username>Expedia reviewer</username><UserId.>None<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Our stay was just fine.  The rooms were clean and service was okay.  That said, we had one of the worst meals ever in the restaurant and our room (3rd floor) reeked of fish from the restaurant.< /review>

< Review>
Was looking forward to this romantic getaway. We love a quirky bed and breakfast. The experience at the mirabelle was just... ok. The bathroom was outdated and minimal.Bed was cozy. The staff was short and sweet.Room was not welcoming and did not come with wine. Not the worst, definitely not the best and for sure $$Not worth the price$$Maybe there was a different vibe before covid? We travel to the area a lot and won't be staying here again.</Review>

The Inn was absolutely charming, and the staff was so professional and friendly. They greeted us by name each time they saw us and gave great recommendations for things to do in town. The breakfast was also delicious! Our favorite was the avocado toast! I highly recommend the Mirabelle Inn!< /Text>

<review>First off the staff were friendly and helpful but that  is where the good ends. We were very disappointed  by the value we received for our money. This hotel is far from 4 star and by far I mean FAR!!. No room service, no coffee maker, no phone, no mini fridge and breakfast was 2 pasties one per person .. the room was absolute basic, which would be fine but not for the price we paid.  We ended up going to the hotels restaurant which was suppose to be a Michelin Star and I can tell you my heart sank when the food arrived. We had a couple sit next to us and we all made eye contact pondering how does this meal cost this much.  The reviews on the hotel and restaurant were very high but I don’t understand how, the experience and reviews were so polar opposite that I’m seriously thinking they are fake. We left feeling conned by the whole experience, boy did you not get what you paid for. I would not recommend</review></record>

<text>Positive: This hotel is a cute quaint hotel, located in a decent spot in Solvang. Negative: We booked the Suite, which was incredibly outdated compared to the rest of the hotel.

At first glance I was a little leery due to the location being so small from outer appearance. Once I entered the lobby I exhaled!😍 The staff were super chill, conversation flowed seamlessly! The entire stay was exquisite! Dinner at First&Oak (2019 Michelin Plate)</review>

The hotel has everything we had wished for. Old world charm, friendly staff and just a walking distance to all tourist spots. The L'occitane products was a very nice touch. We were pleasantly surprised that the hotel houses a 2019 Michelin Star Restaurant, which was like an add on bonus.< /Text>

Pros:

Superb customer service.
Modern bedroom
Comfortable beds
Close to the city center
Great restaurant
Complimentary wine
Great AC

Cons:

Bathrooms / showers are old and desperately need an upgrade. Shower curtains smelled and it had an old bathroom type of vibe.
Flat pillows
Subpar complimentary breakfast that only included a couple danishes.< /text>

This inn was amazing! My husband and I chose to stay here for our last romantic getaway, before he passed away from cancer.  The wonderful staff went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care!
Now that some time has gone by since his passing, I can't wait to go back and visit the memories. It's a weekend I will cherish for the rest of my life.
Thank you so much Mirabella... I'll see you soon.</text>

<text>booked the suite at the hotel as my son was traveling with us upon check in the room was a bit creepy (feeling haunted) both the beds had dirt on them from cobweb my main bed had coffee stains on the sheets and blanket.  we asked the room to be cleaned and sheets to be changed... came back to the same dirty beds.  save your money and stay somewhere else.< /text>< Pics>

Beautiful,  very clean, excellent food! Worth the price. We stayed in the Suite. The only thing I recommend is a mirror outside and extra trash  cans near the beds. The only mirror is inside the bathroom and it was difficult to get ready. Very nice staff.< /Text>

The breakfast was way more than I was expecting when you hear free. They made either omelets or oatmeal, with danishes and yogurt parfaits.  The place is a little dated, but other than that it was a great place and we will absolutely be back!<//text>< time>

<review>Cute hotel. Great location. The staff is really nice. Their breakfast is good and served later that typical places,  8am to 10am. They provide shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash, soap, cotton, and q-tips. They also give you a complimentary bottle of wine and cookies. Only reason for the 4 starts instead of 5 is because the walls are super thin, and you can hear pretty much everything in the rooms next to you.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>The hotel itself is very nice and the woman at the front desk was helpful when we called for suggestions. When we checked in though, we weren't told that our room had a non working fire place that we wanted to use. We were also given no information about the hours of the breakfast in the morning so we missed it. We were also told that when we checked in we would be given suggestions of things to see in town and that was never given. Overall, we understood it was a busy holiday weekend and they were overworked. The room and hotel itself was beautiful plus the little touches were very nice. I would stay again but make sure that I sat down with the person checking me in to make sure I got all the info I wanted.<//Review>< Rate>

Stayed overnight for a get away trip with my wife. The room was very cozy, and we'll maintained. The heating for the room could us an update, as the there is no temp setting available, you either turn on or off depending on how you feel. The staff was very helpful and nice, will definitely stay here again.</text>

<text>The restaurant at Mirabelle called first and oak was one of the best restaurant experience s I've had in awhile. We fine dine and go out pretty often and a lot of times we found little wow factor especially at the price points at some of these restaurants. First and oak however wow'd us with each dish they presented and I'm dreaming of their risotto right now. Even better than the ones we've had in Italy.< /text>< rate>

It was just lovely, they gave you a wonderful assortment of teas from Far West Tea, and a really delightful array of goodies.  There wasn't anything traditional in the finger foods, except the scones and Lemon curd.  Everything else had what you would expect from the Chef at First & Oak.  A seared ahi tuna over a kimchi crackle, a short rib and fennel sandwich, the desserts were so good, mini cheesecake, mini chocolate tartlets, Macarons etc.  It was really lovely, I took my Mother in Law and it was the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon...< /review>< pictures>

Mirabelle came highly recommended by one of the locals as the best in Solvang. Our fantasy football draft was in the area, and with most of us being foodies, I went ahead and made reservations for all 14 of us. The owners contacted me, both of them very nice and accommodating, and worked with me to make it a great night. And it was! The food was fantastic...interesting, well-presented, and very tasty. The wine was great and the '70-something port was a real treat. Most of all though, the personal attention by the owners and great service, made for a memorable and special night. Highly recommended!< /Review>

Went to restaurant First and Oak. Was looking for a place to eat. Their menu is a tasting menu so everyone shared. Spent more than expected. Best dish was pork belly.</Review>

It is a lovely older building that has some updates. Our biggest disappointment was that our room, #3, was not quiet!  We were at the top of the stairs and you could hear all conversations in the small lobby area at the foot of the stairs, plus some noise from restaurant and breakfast area. The people in the room above us were up talking and moving around all night and with the wood type flooring all the noise was heard. Needless to say, it was not a very restful night. The staff was excellent, the complimentary morning breakfast was above average, and location good. So, if you can live with the noise, a nice place to stay.<//Review>

Those are definitely worth a try! To my Filipino friends, this might be the only place to find that Philippines' Ice scramble in the Los Angeles Valley.

Parking can be challenging. Wait time can be long because only one person works there most of the time. Your experience might vary.< /Text>< resp>

This place is disappointing. I don't know how it got such good reviews. The drinks were not impressive at all. Taro was too sweet, made with powder. Rose tea was very rosy, and this was probably the best here. Thai ice tea was again made with powder, not fresh. Milk tea was bland. Boba was fresh and decent. The server didn't want to be there, too good to be serving us drinks...< /Text>

Such a cozy little place with a huge menu of drinks.  Horchata smoothie with almond pudding & boba was delicious!  Very kid friendly with lots of children's books and games.  We hung out and played Battleship.  Can't wait to come back and try the ramen and the London Fog smoothie with boba!<//review>

The boba drinks they make here are amazing and the staff are super friendly! The lady I see there all the time always makes me come back because of how nice she always is to me my mom and sister. She knows me after me always ordering my ube drink that she suggested to me lol. But definetly come here if you like good customer service and amazing boba.< /Text>

Excellent selection of boba! I probably come here at least twice a month since I found it this last summer. They make homemade horchata which they then use for the delicious smoothie with boba. FYI winter hours started today.</text>

<Text>Very cozy, drawing supplies for kids and their art all over the wall, the selection is INSANE. Smoothies, boba teas, hot teas, slushies, dozens of toppings, added flavors, a few desserts, AND a small selection of meals. They can make any of their drinks vegan, and did a taro almond milk smoothie for me (with oreo crumbles). It's bigger than it looks outside with a nicely sized eating area. It's easy to miss this gem but trust me, you don't want to.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Ordered the avacado smoothie after not having one for quite a while. It was good and I generally enjoyed it! The boba was nice and the avacado tasted good.

If you like avacado smoothies I would recommend that you try it out.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I love stopping by this place when I am in the valley. They have all sorts of flavors and textures of different boba. There is an indoor seating area where you can sit and use your laptop connected to Wi-Fi and enjoy the drink. They also serve soup but I have not tried it yet. There are couches and table games that people play along with reading material. The owner is really friendly and helpful to answer all of my questions.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

It's the best boba I have ever had. Customer service it's amazing. My favorite is the Lychee with Rosewater jelly . There is actually a few favorite drinks. My family and I just love it. They offer a card after your 10th boba you get a free one. They have tables, board games and books for the kids.<//Review>

< Review>
When I walked into Sago Boba Shop I was surprised by its uniqueness. It is unlike any other boba spot I have been to and that is because of the abundance amount of toys, children's books, candy, chips, and drawings laid out on the right side of the establishment's wall. It certainly appeals to families and the place seems nice for children. The worker was helpful and informal, she informed me of the sushi burrito and that it is a special item served only on the weekends.

Their boba was good, nothing extraordinary from what I have tasted. I give their Cookies n Cream smoothie with boba a 4/5 and their Strawberry smoothie with boba a 4/5 as well. It is a good spot nearby.< /Review>

<time>1614557048905< /time><rating>1</rating><review>It looks kinda fancy with the purple and blue lights but when it comes to how the machines clean the car it’s a very different story. I’d much rather just get my car washed at Seven Eleven for the same price. My car always comes out much cleaner and with no shampoo residue everywhere. Mister clean is only good if you’re in a hurry and the car isn’t really dirty to begin with. Otherwise just go to Seven Eleven or any other car wash in the area.< /review>< Pictures>

I've had a membership at one other place and I really like this one better. It does a better job of washing my car and it doesn't take as long as the other one did. They could afford to have more vacuums here but I have never had to wait. I try not to go at busy times to avoid this. The monthly rate is perfectly reasonable<//Text>

Getting the Monthly Unlimited Pass is the best value. Even when there is a line it takes no longer than 10 mins from driving up and leaving. When slow it takes like 4 mins< /Review>

When it was pro shine it never got the back of my hatchback at all and never got the front bugs off. Now that the wash has been changed it now gets it. FINALLY. I pay for the unlimited and get the extra wash perks and I was thinking of cancelling it but now it’s worth it. I have OCD and I wash my two cars at least once a week each.<//text>

This place is trash. The prices went way up after they went from primeshine to mister. The $12 value did literally nothing to my exterior. And they didn’t even give me whipes for the interior. Bring back primeshine!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I did not like. To enter the wash is on a curve and you can barely enter. Your car is all wet and soapy.

(Original)
No me gusto. Para entrar al wash esta en curva y apenas y puedes entrar. Tu carro queda todo mojado y con jabón.</Text>

Honest, responsive and caring. I had a horrible backed up shower that was impacting the shower, the tub, the sink and the washer. The problem was resolved in less than 30 minutes and for a very reasonable price. Andy Carrillo was awesome. Definitely will use again.</review>

Very professional from the person that took the request to the person that showed up.  They were able to come out next day and take care of a clogged drain.  Explained all the charges and estimates right away which were reasonable and affordable.  Would highly recommend and use again.< /review>

Be sure and ask for Mr. Rooter Plumbing of Long Beach. They  really good plumber and a geed communicator. They was efficient and knew what they was doing. I wouldn't hesitate to ask for him, should we have another plumbing issue.I needed to get a pressure regulator valve, earthquake automatic shutoff valve, and washing machine drain installed. The plumbing technicians were thorough in explaining what needed to get done and why. Very helpful!
OK great quality work stayed in constant communication with me during the whole process. Felt like they were definitely professionals highly recommend them to anyone.</review>

This was an outstanding experience. They came within an hour on a Sunday and within an hour of getting here, the pipe was fixed and the leak was corrected. They came back the next day exactly as promised to move the water heater for a remediation company. I thoroughly recommend them. Our warranty company sent two other plumbers, one of whom didn’t turn up and the other which wouldn’t answer his phone.  Chris Martin is excellent.< /Text>

This crew was efficient, professional and courteous.They replaced our pipes from the meter on the street to the faucet at the front of the house . Laying 60 feet of copper pipe. Mr Rooter to the rescue ! 😎 Keith went above  and beyond making sure that everything in the house was working well. Extra points for dealing with a toilet that isn’t easily accessible. Thanks to all the crew. I really appreciated there help!< /Text>

They came out on a Sunday for an emergency. A duplex was all backed up almost to the point of flooding. They surveyed the problem and came up with a solution.  I had major problems that involved no clean out drain, a broken underground pipe, roots in a pipe and a gas leak. It was expensive to fix everything but it had to be done. They took 3 days, so they took their time making sure everything was fixed. They also shot a liner in some old pipe.  They came with camera's, equipment, and everything I needed so I didn't have to piece together a bunch of subcontractors. You pay for their service and their convenience. For this job, I think it was worth it.< /text>

Brian was very helpful by explaining the services I needed for my water heater. He didn't try and sell me all the work I needed to do but broke it down for me by what's most important to do. I felt that I could trust this company to do a good job and not try and charge me for things that I didn't need. I will be calling them in the near future.</Review>

Brian Lutche was our service technician and he was outstanding. Brian was professional and extremely quick and efficient. We had a drain clog in our kitchen sink, and Brian fixed the problem within 15 minutes. He also provided us guidance on how to prevent it from occuring in the future. We are extremely happy with the service and highly recommend him!</text>

I had a great experience with Mr. Rooter Plumbing. My water heater had a leak. They sent a technician out right away. He assessed the damage and recommended a new heater to replace the rusty twenty-year old heater. The work was completed in just a few hours.< /text>

The technician Brian came to my house in 30 minutes to unclog the toilet my son ended up clogging with who knows what. He was in and out in less than 10 minutes.  I'm really glad they were able to send someone right away because I had worked the following night and I was tired and had to sleep for work again that same night. And the price was reasonable as well. Will be using them in the future for any clogging problems.</Text>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Had a backed up shower and sink. Called at 10am, and was able to book for a time window that would not conflict with my wife’s work teaching from home and my kids being online for school.
Service Technician Chris M. showed up at the start of the agreed upon 2 hour window, after the Mr. Rooter dispatcher called me to let me know he was on his way.
The most important part for me was this: Chris maintained social distance at all times, and had his mask on (being worn correctly) before even exiting his truck. Chris came and went from the back door of the house to further maintain safe distance from the rest of the family on the other side of our 1600sq/ft house.

Chris diagnosed a probable issue quickly and went to work with his snake. Our pipes are on the older side, so it took him a little extra effort, but he got it done quickly. The final price was the same as quoted at his arrival, and he even gave me some info on Mr. Rooters reptile services and costs.

I’ll call Mr Rooter LB again for a drain issue, no hesitation at all, and I’ll probably get a quote from them for the inevitable repiping.< /Text><Rating>4< /Rating></record>

Brian from Mr. Rooter was very professional. He arrived on time and had on his face mask on the whole time. My area drain was clogged and created a muddy mess around my house. He was able to snake out the problem and spotted a correct drain pipe to fix. We called other plumbers but not all service outdoor area drains. Glad Mr. Rooter offers this service and was able to send someone out faster than other places I called.<//Review>

Bought a new washer, realized that one pipe was leaking. Couldn't risk doing further damage, so I called Mr Rooter plumbing. Mainly because they were local and I needed it fixed today. Bryan was awesome.  So very helpful and friendly.  Most of all, the leak was fixed.< /Review>

<Review>Service performed by Mr Myers was expedient and professional (had a faucet installed in the kitchen, repair to toilet in one bathroom, & water pressure adjusted in  2nd bathroom).  Extremely knowledgable and courteous.  Arrived during the time frame given earlier that morning & work completed same day.  I think this is a wonderful company & I would recommend them to anyone in a New York minute!</Review></record>

After 3 days with no toilet and a failed attempt by a different plumbing company we called Mr. Rooter.  We had a wonderful experience when our home was serviced by Brian L.  He was very friendly and professional.  He arrived at the scheduled time and got straight to business and made sure to communicate to us what he was doing, the condition of the plumbing in the home and what further steps we needed to take.  As renters, we appreciated that he kept us informed but also communicated the same information to our landlord.  After our experience with Mr Rooter and Brian L, we now know that they will be the first to call with any future events.  Thank you so much Brian!< /text>

My experience with Mr. Rooter was excellent. They’re honest and get the job fast and effectively. The company sent Chris Martin come and fix our drain and vent lines in our laundry room and he broke down the issue to me (a novice when it comes to plumbing) perfectly so I could understand everything that was going on and he provided me with several recommendations. I will be using Mr. Rooter for all plumbing issues going forward.</Text>

Called about a leaking toilet.  Was given a next day appointment but a follow up call asked if I would like a same day visit instead? Oh yes!! So now I have a brand new sparkling clean toilet with my decade old one hauled away.  Tom was professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.   Thanks Mr. Rooter!  I exclusively use their services as they don’t let me down.< /Text>

< Review>
Problem fixed easily with Mr Rooter. Previous plumber, Drain Fast, was recommended by Plumbers World. I felt trying a small business, during the past few months with everything shut down,  should be used. A disaster. Chris, Mr Rooter,  was on time, polite, knowledgeable and explained the repair. Thank you. That’s how it should be. You can depend on Mr Rooter.

Small businesses are having problems and we all want to help each other. But a plumber like Drain Fast-who just left  an open area on a dishwasher, is a disgrace to his profession. That was Drain Fast. Avoid it.

I have used Mr Rooter  for at least 15 years.
The past few months tugged at my heart to use a small business. Then, I recently called Drain Fast, as their repair was not working. Owner, Josh, was to call back. I now see why he avoided me. God sees this too.  Attempting to help another does not always work. Stick with what you know.</Review>

<Review>Our old house has required lots of attention during the last several years and Mr. Rooter has done a great job taking care of it's plumbing needs.
The techs are always friendly and demonstrate the professional skills needed to do the job correctly and quickly.  I like the way they are able to explain what needs to be done and how they will do it.  Importantly, when the job is done they leave everything neat and clean.</Review>< pics>

I have used your service for several times.
The pricing was reasonable and the services were good. This time I had a leaking in my bedroom faucet area. Changing and installation of the faucet costs $559.01, pop up sink drain in the same place for $123.53 and put a new tank fill valve for $94.47 total $779.01. He gave me 10% discount it came up $699. I think the price is too high for the services. The faucet and pop up should be the one package. If I called for technician separate time he could charge the above price but he was already here and charging $94.47 for 5 minutes job for the tank fill valve is rip-off. I am truly upset for the price and I hope this matter should be considered by the management or the owner.
Thank you,</review>

Called them after the main pipe got clogged on the 4th of July weekend and luckily they were opened and working. Our bathtub overflow into the bathroom, hallway and part of the laundry room. I called several places and nobody was working even the guy I always call for this type of work. Only one rooter company was working and available but wanted to charge us an arm and a leg. To my surprise they were even cheaper than the other places.
Chris arrived in time within the estimated 2 hour gap and did his magic really quick and professionally. He pointed out where the main was broken and showed me with the camera. He suggested changing it which at the moment wasn't our priority but definitely is something to do in the future.
Thanks for rescuing us during holiday hours so we can use the house water again.< /text>

Left a voicemail late on Sunday night and got a call back first thing on Monday morning. They were able to squeeze me in on short notice. Brian, technician, arrived on time within the service window provided, and was professional, polite, and thorough. Not only did he clear out the root and buildup between house and main deer line, he took the time to inspect via camera and show where the roots were coming in and was able to advise on next steps. Would use them again if needed and would recommend.

Home is now plumbing clear for the holidays!!!< /review>

Ours was a plumbing nightmare in a house built in 1939. But their plumber Brian did a great job replacing the old steel flange in concert with a new unit. Although there was a delay in getting the part Saturday the job was completed in a timely manner on Monday morning.<//text>

<Review>Chris Martin was perfect, very fast and thorough, cleared our shower drain that we could not after we used draino and a plunger and an auger. Also informed us about drain pipes being old and made of iron when the landlord claimed there had been a repipe with copper only a year ago. Thank you very much. 2 dispatch schedulers, tanya and another woman working in the morning of 04/19/2020 were very patient and accommodating when setting up the time and date around our schedule.</Review>< Pics>

Found Mr Rooter on google and saw the great reviews. Boy am I glad I did, because Brian was the best. He was super knowledgeable and went above and beyond my expectations. We have an old house and we have hired a few different companies for problems we’ve had. None of them seemed to want to figure out the root of the problem. They just wanted to do a quick fix. Brian went under the house and took pictures of what our (all original) pipes looked like. He was very friendly and We are really happy with the price as well.</review>

Mr Rooter Plumbing is always very courteous and professional. They also let you know everything upfront and let you know the best way to proceed forward with your particular situation. They are also very timely and clean. I would recommend them to everyone. I appreciate how they take care of their customers.

Great customer service! I had sent a message through their site to get a quote on replacing the main sewerline, drainage pipes and waterlines. I wasn't expecting a call till the next business day, but within 10 minutes, I received a phone call.

An appointment was set for a plumber to come by; Brain L. was the guy who came over, he went under the crawlspace to check everything out, addressed my concerns and went over different options.

He was great at explaining everything, what he recommended and didn't try to upsell me unnecessary things. He quoted me a good price for all the work that needed to be done and estimated the entire project to take at least three days.

In the end, it only took a day and half, half the estimated time, so I was impressed with how fast they did all the work. They did great work, cleaned up everything after they were done and answered any questions I had.

I highly recommend Mr. Rooter, and ask for Brain L.

Mr. Rooter, Brain L. deserves a huge raise!

Sidenote: The dispatchers (Tania is the one I spoke to most often) do a wonderful job at communication, they call to let you know when the plumber is on their way, if you don't pick up, they'll leave a voice message AND send you a text if it's a cell number.

I do like that Mr. Rooter utilizes texting as a way of communication with their customers, keeping up with the times.< /Review>

Mr. Rooter did a quick and amazing job on my plumbing. Another company gave me a list of items and a week long time frame, Mr. Rooter came out, quoted and did the work in hours. They were very professional and completed everything in 1 day.

Would really like to thank John and Gareth for the amazing work. Definitely recommend them< /Text>

I have a gas leak issue in my place , so i called and schedule an appointment with Mr. Rooter in Long Beach which came on time within a small time window, which is for itself commendable .
Brian lutche showed up and took his time to assess the situation in a very methodical and professional manner . Walked me through and explain to me what does the job entailed before giving me an estimate ,He wrote a very detailed proposal which seems fair price wise  . It was a good experience all things consider and i would totally recommend those guys to anyone that is in a need of a plumber< /review>

<text>Thank you Tom from Mr. Rooters Plumbing. Had a leaking toilet and he was good in explaining the problem and how he was going to fix it. Also was not given a ridiculous 4 hour window.</text></record>

<Text>Arrived about an hour after calling on a Sunday afternoon, which was a fantastic relief. Armando was polite, courteous and professional. He sorted the blockage in minutes, and asked lots of questions to ensure the problem was solved and we were left with robust plumbing. I was also impressed at how respectful and tidy he was. Will definitely be the first place I call!</Text>< Pictures>

I loved the courtesy and professionalism of the plumber. I will use Mr. Rooter again because of the awesome service. The price was reasonable also.

I’ve used their service recently March 2020 and my review is : I love this company and their service. Their technicians are professional, kind and very efficient. Special kudos to Chris Martin who I highly recommend. Another wonderful guy , Brad who came out about a year ago was also excellent.<//review>

< Review>
Without getting into too much detail of the problem, we needed someone out here soon.
Andy, who was here s few yesrs ago, quickly diagnosed the problem, informed us of the cost and the cure, and went to work on it. He was very professional. The young lady I spoke to first, set up the appointment, and kept us informed as to when the tech would be here. Outstanding job, thank you Mr. Rooter, and thank you Andy........Bill and Kathie Price</Review>

<Review>I actually feel excited about this company.
I used this company today for the first time and I feel reakly good about them.  They carefully went over each problem I had and solved them.  They charged me a fair price as well.  AND they are available weekends.  I am going to call this company first from now one for all my plumbing needs.  Of course I'll see how they perform for now on  but  it's really nice when you come across an honest company.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1568299093568, 'text': 'We pride ourselves on customer service and being there in a time of need!!

<Text>Phone rep was pleasant and managed to get me an appointment on the same day.  Tech arrived within the time frame provided by the phone rep.  Work was done within a reasonable time frame and a camera was inserted into our sewage line to show that all blockages were cleared.  Price for a sewer line clean out was very reasonable at $99</Text>< rating>

A dispatcher from mr rooter called to say that the plumber who was suppose to fix our toilet and change our garbage disposal did not report for work today. I told them the urgency of having it fixed since I have guests coming to the house. Next call I got from them was to let me know that they asked someone on day off to come to the house instead. Brian Lutche came and fixed the problem in not time including the clogged kitchen sink. Thank you Mr rooter and Brian for helping us with our plumbing problems when we needed it most. Thank you for being reliable and  professional. Will definitely call you again for any plumbing service we need.<//Review>

I called the service line and after I answered a million questions about me and my water heater they were able to send someone out quickly in the early evening when most people are in traffic on there way home for the day (including myself).

The guy dispatched was prompt on arrival, clean and professional, he was also proficient in his knowledge of his craft! I say this because he didn't mind answering my questions while I looked over his shoulder and watched him work.

I would definitely use them again!< /Review>

I’ve had the Mr. Rooter magnet on my fridge for years. On Sunday morning I found myself with a slow flushing toilet. Decided to call Mr. Rooter to find out that there was no extra charge for Sunday calls and that they were running a special on the service I needed. They were available and arrived within 30 minutes. The plumber was nice, took care of the problem, and left my bathroom as clean as he found it. I will definitely be calling Mr. Rooter the next time I find myself needing a plumber.< /Text>

Just wanted to say, that my service tech John was awesome!  We received a phone call the morning of our scheduled appointment to inform us of the arrival time. John was  very prompt.  He gave us an estimate on both projects. Explained everything thoroughly. We had a sink installed and he replaced all the old plumbing parts. Our toilet had a leak and he repaired that as well. John was very professional and knowledgeable. I will definitely call Mr. Rooter when ever I have plumbing needs. Thanks John!!!< /Text>

Quick, informative and efficient. I called on Sunday due to my toilet and shower backing up. They were able to schedule a same day appointment and within a 2 hour window frame. They were courteous enough to call ahead to let me know the plumber could be here earlier, which was great. Within 10 minutes my sewer line was cleared. They were professional and informative and suggested I should replace my cast iron pipes to alleviate issues. I did not feel pressured and would not hesitate to give Mr. Rooter a call when I am prepared to redo my pipes.< /Text>

It took Jim exactly 52 seconds to unclog the toilet! Wow! Jim was very professional and very helpful. He told to get a toilet auger if we had more toilet issues. Well... a month later I had the same issue, went to Ace hardware and got a toilet auger. I watched some videos online and I was able to unclog the toilet by myself!  Not only Mr. Rooter was efficient but very helpful! I will be calling them for any other plumbing issues. My final invoice was $79 to unclog the toilet.</Review>< user_name>

Had sewer line replaced in 2016 , spent several thousand dollars with Long Beach Mr.Rooter.Great Job. To make us feel satisfied Mr. Rooter sent us a 50.00 off coupon....next service. No expiration date on coupon or any language about the coupon being not valid or restrictions. Well we a drain clean out today and of course they did not accept the coupon. They had a special price promotion on this particular service making this coupon not valid. Just another gimmick being performed by the companies to the average hard working Joe. They should have some language on these coupons to clarify when their valid.</review>

We had a pipe burst after 5:00 on a Thursday night.  I called Mr. Rooter because of their reviews and a technician was at hour home with an hour, turned off the water and diagnosed the problem.  A previous home owner had removed the water shut off valve and put in a poor outside hose bib. The technician, Shai, was back at our home Saturday morning, took the pvc previously installed apart and replaced everything with copper.  It not only looks better, it's done properly.<//review>

<review>I haven't had any plumbing issues before and when our kitchen sink started to clog, my husband and I tried to fix it thinking it would work but it didn't. so we checked yelp and mr rooter plumbing of long beach came up in the top 5 companies. as soon as my husband emailed them, tanya responded right away. thinking it was closed on sunday, I checked the business time frames & they are 24/7. we were literally washing dishes in the bathroom and in the laundry basin. anyways, shay called during the time frame that tanya set the appointment at and said he was close by. within minutes he cleaned out the drain and it is running like new. they even take cash, check, or credit cards. lastly, shay confirmed that there is a 30-day warranty so if there were any problems, I could give him a call. nice!<//review>< date>

Was promised a call first thing Sunday.  As promised got a call around 8:30, tech was there. By 9:00.  Job finished by 9:45.  Stuck to the $79.00 price quoted.  No up charges or extra weekend fees!

Great service, great price, couldn’t be happier!

Will definitely call again if/when the need arises.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1554130820333, 'text': 'WOOHOOO!!!

Really great customer service and experience with our plumber John. Very clean work and had all necessary supplies/tools. A little pricey but all worth it with the quality of work and a year warranty on the project. Will be calling again for future work. Thanks !</review>

Called bright and early Sunday morning and they answered and sent someone out promptly.
Thank goodness for their help because we had a major water leak.
Shai showed up within a reasonable time was friendly and courteous. He assessed the situation and got to work. The pipe was fixed and everything back to normal within a couple of hours. Thank you for your service.</Review>

We had a large leak that was sputtering alot of water.  The man came in less than the 40 mins he said he would be here.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient.   He solved our problem and the vost was modest.  I would recommend this company for all your plumbing needs.<//Review>

I just called to ask what kind of service they provide and the lady did not even allow me to finish my question and she hung up the phone on me. Our company spends about $30k annually as we have a large plant. She missed out on great earnings. I only chose one star because that was the minimum or else I would have rated them at zero.< /text>

Trenchless sewer main replacement was done quick and easy. The work was done by professionals Steven Serrano and his crew. The technicians are courteous, skilled and experienced. Work done has 30 year warranty by a strong plumbing company. The procedure was expensive but it was worth it for the peace of mind it provides. I hated having clay pipes with multiple weak joints. Now my house is worry free. This sewer main is done right.</Review>

<text>My plumbers tried 3 different ways to unclog my drains and made two calls to my house to clear them; eventually it took opening the wall and taking out a section of pipe, which is what another plumber had said. Mr. Rooter did it for cheaper and did minimal replacement which is what I needed because I planned on having people move into my property the next day. They only charged me for what method worked, despite the time and equipment involved with the other methods, including using a camera to find the blockage, which was cool. The staff were friendly. I appreciated their work. I only wish they had patched the wall after the job and re-connected the vanity to the wall, or disclosed ahead of time that that wasn't part of the bill. But for the price and efficiency, I'll take it.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>My tankless system stopped working Sat night while taking a shower. I had collected several flyers and decided to give Mr. Rooter a call. The dispatcher was empathetic to my problem and quickly set up a service call for early Mon morning. I was surprised when two service technicians made the house call.  Greg and John immediately when to work performing a complete diagnostic exam.  They corrected the problem quickly and my hot water returned. Greg and John were professional, courteous, and neat. They are my go to plumbers on speed dial for any plumbing problem in the future.  Thank you,  R. Waki< /Review>< Pics>

This company is awesome and professional. They had someone out within hours to clean our drain as our showers wouldn’t drain however Shai was unable to do so and advised me on what needed to be done and the cost. I called back two days later Shai was off but they sent John out within the hour and everything is working great. This was the 3rd plumber I’ve had to call in the last month and the only one who found an actual problem with the remodel under the house and I honestly couldn’t be happier. It was also easy on the wallet, hundreds less than I thought I’d have to spend.</text>

After looking into your service request, I am unable to find any record of a phone call that spoke to our answering service. If you could provide me a little more information regarding the matter I can verify whether this was for our location or another franchises location (each Mr. Rooter services a different area). Customer satisfaction is very important to us and I would like to help point you in the right direction or resolve the matter for our future customers. You can contact me directly at 562-473-4490.
