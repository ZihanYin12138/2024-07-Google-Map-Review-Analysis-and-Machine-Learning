< Review>
Facilmente es la mejor comida Mexica autentica en Los Angeles, and I've tried so many places. Their menu is delicious and has something for everyone, and their taste is consistent every single time. Absolutely love their salsas! If you are into spicy, this is your place.The service from the owners and their family makes it such an enjoyable experience, they have a great attitude. Prices are more than fair. Try anything on their menu and you'll be blown away from the authenticity, freshness, and taste.< /Review>

< Review>
Where do I start... this place is out of this world!! To start off, this is 110% AUTHENTIC MEXICAN cuisine. I've had almost their entire menu and everything is delicious! Some of my favorites: tortas ahogadas, carne en su jugo, queso fundido,chilaquiles, and thwir salsas are soo tasty, spicy, and all have a different kick! The owners are so down-to-earth, professional, and genuine. Everything about this gem is a VIBE.. the place's deco is super cute, the food is amazing, and their service is great! Check them out, you'll wish you had done it sooner!< /Review>

Updated again. Updated! This is my brother in law's place. I live in another state but have enjoyed his cooking for many years! You definitely need to visit and you will taste authentic flavors straight out of Mexico.  I cant wait to go myself.
Later.... my wife arrived from Los Angeles with a Torta Ahogada from this place. Can you believe? First bite was Awesome... same as ever.
Finally, actually went there 11Mayo2019. Menu is more than i expected. Food is better than i remember. This is an undiscovered gem! They are planning to add outside tables under the trees in a rear courtyard.
Another visit, another great experience.  Agua de Jamica is the best i have ever had, full of flavor and slightly tart, not sticky sweet like most places. You gotta try this place yourself.

Here again today. Was here 3 days ago. Torta ahogada mojada was even better than  before. Approaching addiction.

Son in law likes mixing Jarritos Tamarindo with Agua Jamaica.

Just back from Guadalajara, ate in 3 popular restaurants, AND Carnes Asadas Pancho Lopez in Los Angeles still has the best tasting Torta Ahogada!

Now with live music!< /review>

<Text>So absolutely disappointed!! Could not believe the terrible service and disrespectful behavior we received from the owner! I had purchased a special discount certificate that sane night online and upon arriving there, I was told that they no longer accept them. Even though, I had called first & spoke with the owner & then proceeded to drive 30 minutes to get there. My spouse and I were starving & explained that to him. The owner proceeded to be very sarcastic & cold and said he doesn't honor the discount even though we just purchased it. The owner was very rude and disrespectful & did not care to remedy the situation in any way. He sent us away starving in a rude manner. We lost the money on the certificate and on all the gas it took for us to get there. Very very disappointed! This is not how you run a business. We received very poor customer service and a disrespectful sarcastic attitude!< /Text>< pictures>

<response>None</response><Text>Go for the authentic taste of Guadalajara.  We had menudo, chile relleño and sopes (pork and beef).  Everything was really good, except the beef was a bit too salty for our taste.  We especially liked the home-made salsas on the table.  I loved orange colored hot sauce.  The prices were reasonable, about $11/person + tip with soft drinks.

So, why not 5 stars?  The lovely dining area is actually a patio that is up about 6 steps.  It has an open side, and I got a mosquito bite.  That may also be authentic, but it's not for me.  To their credit, they did have some kind of electronic bug repeller plugged in at the end of an extension cord, and there were no flies, but window screens would be nice.  Also, the waiter struggled a bit with English, and the whole room had light and sound from a soccer game playing on a TV by the steps.

We will go back, but I will wear long pants and a shirt with sleeves.< /Text>< Rate>

< review>
This place is amazing!!! If you’re looking for authentic mexican food this place has it, the food is delicious and tastes like you’re in Mexico!! My family had the Tortas Ahogadas, carne en su jugo, tacos de barbacoa and it’s the best Mexican food we’ve had around LA! We drove 30 minutes from where we live but it was soo worth it, we’ll definitely be coming back!</review>

< review>
I stopped by for lunch with my partner. The birria was cooked perfectly, the barbacoa tacos we’re really good, and the quesadillas with chorizo were also great. I ate to the point that I couldn’t eat anymore, is so good! All the staff were so kind and helpful. I would have taken pictures, but I ate too fast.< /review>

Then I ordered the pancho Lopez plate !  I think it was one of the best steaks I ever had. Also try Cafe de Hoya it was delicious. Super enjoyable atmosphere. The service of the waitress (Jessica). It’s wonderful. Definitely highly recommended. We looking forward for coming back soon.</Review><UserId.>114774712614920551367</UserId.>< Name>

It is worth driving once in a while 1 hour and a half (since I live super far) to eat of this delicacy of food that reminds me of my hometown.

These people deserve a review they were sooo awesome, friendly and knowledgeable I felt excited about shopping for vitamins now that's a heck of a statement. It's hard to locate some of the items because they have a ton of products but if you just ask them they will definitely help you out. I also got a subscription that will deliver some of the new supplements to my house, through them. Thanks guys for helping me stay in good health:)<//Text>

These guys have zero knowledge of what they sell
They are selling their products simply based on the price. If it cost more then it must be better. When I asked a question about something that they had no clue about they answered, "oh, I think it was discontinued". A product that is currently thriving.. This is why people are buying everything online now. Sad but true.<//Text>

<review>Jonathan was very, very rude. First of all, I wasn't  greeted upon coming in the store. Second  of all, once I retrieved  my merchandise and  proceeded to the counter I STILL wasn't greeted,  I was asked  if I had a phone  number, so I sarcastically  said  hello how are you? It was so ironic  because 2 Hispanic women  walked  in and he goes..." Hey guys welcome " so I immediately asked if he only greeted Latinos.  I have been coming to this establishment for about a year and I have never ever been treated like this . I am totally dissatisfied ,Jonathan's customer service and I definitely will be contacting corporate and I would never ever ever revisit this location. I will be taking my money to GNC from this point on.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Horrible and disgusting customer service! They sold me an open box of keto cookies that was taped closed. My wife didn’t realize it was opened until she left the store. When she got home she saw that it was previously opened and some packages of cookies were missing. Yet these guys thought it was funny to tape the box closed so we wouldn’t notice. To make matters worse, when I called to complain the depraved guy that answered the phone refused to listen and had a major attitude! I Never had problems with other locations but they definitely need to fire the staff working here.<//text><user_id>113983414240243220235< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

I don’t believe I’ve ever had a donut, but I’ve moved three states away and I still dream of their tamales. The masa texture is silky smooth with the perfect ratio of meat content. Every time I’ve been there, they’ve sold out or we buy them all. Seriously, do you guys ship?<//Text>

The owner is extremely nice and every time i come here to buy a half dozen or a dozen donuts, the owner always throws in an extra donut or two. Extremely generous! I love this place and will continue to come back for more! Much Love Sak Donuts! 👌 Has much respect for the homeless and doesn’t kick them out like other donut shops, especially in the coming cold nights. Lots of heart put into their work.< /text>

The tamales. Get the tamales. I'm in Kansas City thinking about them because I miss them so much. Haven't been here in at least 6 years but I think about the tamales a lot. I like the red ones.</text>

No lard (Cambodian Muslim run) tamales, too. Red, mild chicken and green, spicy cheese.  Wrapped in banana leaves, then foil. $2/each.

Available in morning (7AM on my visit).

Easy parking in adjoining lot.< /Review>

I released a series of 6 art prints over the course of a 6 month period. Though they'd be printed at different times, it was imperative that the print quality and alignment from release to release be perfect. I was nervous. These absolute magicians at Family Industries put me at ease and pulled it off. I now live closer to New York than I do L.A. but when the next project comes along where WORLD class quality and craftsmanship is called for, you better believe I'm running it through Family and paying the shipping charge!</text>

Family Industry has been my go to for printers for years.  The team at family is trustworthy, professional, and above all- resourceful.  I have recommended them to MANY friends and colleagues.  Added bonus if you're LA based to support a local business.  That being said- I've referred Family to people around the country who have worked with them to great satisfaction.  Highly recommend.<//text>

<Text>Thank you so much to Family Industries. They have supported the work of Alexandria House for years and provided high quality, most appreciated t-shirts for our vacations camps for kids and for other events. They have great suggestions if our designs aren't exactly what we are looking for, staff is always generous with their time and give us the best "deals" ever. Please support this amazing organization.</Text>< user_name>

My organization, Alexandria House, has worked with Family Industries for years now. They always make high-quality products for us and their team of staff are exceptional people. Throughout the years they have donated thousands of dollars worth of products to us for our events and student camps. We are so grateful for their support. We highly and enthusiastically recommend Family Industries!<//text>

My experience with Family Industries has always been a very easy and pleasant experience.  Any time I've had questions about the product they provide or how they can make the image look the way I need it to be, they've always gone above and beyond and give me exactly what I need.  They even forgot to distress one of my designs once and re-made the whole order again.  I will never go to another T-shirt printing company because they do treat me like family. Thanks Phil and Alex as you guys are always there for us!<//Review>

Super friendly, responsive, and thorough. Their whole team is clearly great, given the quality of the screening and sourcing of great materials. They make it happen, even on a tight timeline.

<Review>I’ve been using Family Industries for a few years now and am always 100% happy in all categories! They are super knowledgable and responsive with a swift turnaround for product. The quality of their prints is unmatched to any other services I’ve used and I’ve never had an issue with cracks or fades.
Their team is superbly personal. I’ve had some struggles with rush times from clients and budgets in the past, but they always find a way to meet my goals without suffering in quality. Now that they’ve moved locations, I hope I can finally pick up orders in person and meet the folks who have been breathing life into my designs!
Thanks so much for all that you do! I owe y’all a drink at Salazar next door once the pandemic is over 😘< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Love the quality and the service at Family Industries. Our apparel brand is based in Hawaii and I still choose to use Family Industries to screen print and embroider our products because of the high quality, excellent communication, and their fair prices. All-in-all an excellent value and easy process!<//Review>

<text>Had Family Industries print a small batch of concert posters for me back in December and they came out awesome! They did two different color schemes and both looked great. Super affordable, as I went with digital printing, and they were ready in just a few days. Great customer service and communication.

<review>I am a huge fan of Family Industries.  They are your one stop shop.  Design, quality, professionalism, punctuality... If you are in apparel, you know how hard it is to find all of this under one roof.  Hoping that my business will grow so that I can continue to bring my ideas to fruition with the Family Industries team!</review>< Rate>

I’ve used Family Industries numerous times now for t-shirt printing. Their work is exceptional, and they are always ready to help with any questions you have. I seriously wouldn’t use another place for my merchandise, can’t recommend them enough.<//text>

Family Industries made on-site T-shirts for our party.  They were easy to work and very professional from design to clean up at the end of the night.  The guests loved the shirt designs.  We will definitely hire them again!</Text>

My company used Family Industries for live T-shirt screen printing at multiple large tradeshows, and our own user conference. For every event their team came prepared, very well organized and were true professionals. Even when we have massive lines (which was ALWAYS because it was such a big hit) they stayed calm, cool and collected. The pre-event communication was always great, very responsive and overall easy to work with. They were very helpful and solution oriented if we ran into any issues and have tons of really fun options for different types of event engagements. It's so refreshing to work with a group of people who really understand customer service, and the importance of a positive experience for event attendees. Would highly recommend them for your next event!< /review>

Great for private or corporate events. Charming staff. With a clever design or two, making custom screen printed shirts on site can really elevate an event.< /review>

Max and Alex of Family Industries are amazing screen printers. I work for a pretty large clothing Co and when we need some products screen printed at the last minute, I know I can count on top quality and on time. We have also used them numerous times for live screen printing and always get rave reviews from our guest about how great they are. I highly recommend Family Industries to anyone who has screen printing needs. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!<//Review>

Family Industries is by far the best silk screening company I have worked with– and I will look no further.  Being an event producer, I need to know that my vendors are reliable and will not give me unwanted stress or headaches.  I was so pleased with my first experience with Family Industries I hired them five times last year.  They have never let me down, always getting my order to me on time and being a pleasure to work with.  Their pricing is fair and competitive with other companies.  Max and Alex’s professionalism both in their customer service, to their knowledge of silk-screening and design is much appreciated.  They will guide you through each order, making sure you are happy with the decisions and will alert you if they think you need to revisit your idea.  They want you to have a quality product and they don’t just want to take your money, this is something that is highly valuable to someone with little experience in silk screening.  I would highly recommend Family Industries.< /Text>

Max has always been straight forward and easy to deal with. They are professional and hard working (some of our events were for 8 straight hours in the boiling sun - not easy).  Prices were fair and Family worked with us on all logistics etc. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for your party or event. Guests are really excited about seeing the live screen printing and the feeling of getting something unique to take away with them.< /review>

Great company.  Max and Alex did a great job and were very patient when I asked a bunch of dumb questions.  We used Family Industries to make t-shirts for our film crew.  The shirts came out great and the turn around time was surprisingly quick.  Will definitely use them again.</review>

I have used Family Industries for small run printing dozens of times over the past 3+ years and WOULD NEVER go to anyone else, EVER. Easy to work with. High quality printing. Great work ethic. Always delivered on time... and with a smile. The guys that run Family Industries are the best, hands down. Support your local LA print shop. You won't be disappointed.< /review>

<text>Family Industries is by far the best Screen Printing shop in LA!!!! The competition does not even stand up against them! I have had some bad experiences with other screen printers but working with Family is always a pleasure. They are fast, professional, talented and will work with you personally to make sure that your product is the best it can be. I have worked with them on numerous small projects and they give it as much attention and care as their large clients. I've also seen them at live events and they are rockstars! There really is no need to go anywhere else for your screen printing needs big or small!!! Their prices are fair, their turnarounds are efficient and their end products are awesome!!!! I recommend them to EVERYONE I know!< /text>< response>

I will say that as a company that has had 1000's of shirts printed over the last 10 years, Family Industries, Max and the whole crew, are by far the best experience we have had. They really helped us work out all the little details to help us get the look we wanted and they kept their word on the delivery schedule. In fact, we are going to look into having them reprint some older designs that didnt come out so well at other printers....

These guys are the real deal, a quality vendor, producing great work, on time and for a very reasonable price... Thanks Guys

<Text>these guys are amazing!!!  we used them for our son's bar mitzvah and from start to finish we couldn't have been happier.  from our initial consult, to the end result, this was one of the coolest things at the party.  alex did four different designs with our input and sent bobby and izzy to print the night of.  they were so cool and easy going and the kids and adults alike were entranced with the whole set-up.  if you're looking for something to put your event over the top, this is it.  and the shirts were really nice quality!  thank you max and family industries!!!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Family Industries is 100% silk screening badassery.  Fam. Ind. was the first screen printer we found that was willing to make what we wanted to have happen, happen... and without the annoying time-wasting push-back we received from other printers when we requested a brand of shirt that they didn't normally carry or with whom they didn't already have an account.  They've helped us save on costs, they've promptly gone to production with our orders and have just generally operated with the goal of trying to accommodate us (two entrepreneurs working full-time jobs and trying to get a business venture off the ground with very limited free-time) as best as possible.  Don't hesitate to meet the team to have your project made into a reality.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c6608abdc743:0x70b298baebd06b1e<//gmapID></record>

<Text>I wanted to try vegan hair color for my roots. Cori is amazing and very sweet. She made me feel so comfortable and of course did a great job. The color came out very nice and looked perfect. I have henna I color and some streaks are deep red so it's hard to match the color. She made the mix based on my existing shade and henna hair. I didn't even see any hair book. And truly i was impressive by her skills.

I also got threading done from here which was done nicely as well.

Ambience is okay, a bit loud sometimes.</Text>< resp>

*********never go store *****
In town lots of other saloon available with cheapest way specially great customer service

I wish if i can give zero star instead.  Never go over their owner  is don’t know how to treat customers zero customer service and she don’t have any expertise on her business just charge more than asking price and force customer to do and crying like i west my time so I charged for that if you don’t want to do as asked before committed</Text>

<Review>I walked in to get a threading today. Neelu helped me,she was very nice, friendly and took all necessary precautions for protection and sanitation. They have made the tent out the store where they are providing service and I was glad that I was able to get my eyebrows done after 4months.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I wish I could put Negative Stars. I came in put my name down waited in line 2 boys were behind me and all 3 of us were asked do you have an appointment all 3 of us said no. Yet when it’s my turn which I waited for 20 mins with no problem I understand they have appointments and are busy the 2 boys were called and done before me. Then the 2 lady’s that worked there realized there mistake spoke in Hindi assuming I wouldn’t understand and said to one another “you took the two boys before her she was first” so when I went to pay I asked for a discount. Then they said no those boys had an appointment (which they stated in front of me they did not). They said they are not the owners and can’t do that. Yet surprisingly another thread artist came and told her customer that she will give her a discount because she made her wait for her scheduled appointment!!!! I looked at the ladies and they said ok we will give you 2 bucks off!!!!! It’s extremely unprofessional to try and cover up your mistake thinking I don’t understand Hindi, then Lie, then instead of apologizing giving me 2 bucks off, and then as I leave calling me a Benchod (witch with a B) Do Not Come Here!!!!!</review>< Name>

<response>{'time': 1566803811828, 'text': 'Hi Bindya,\nThanks for your feedback. I had to take some time to reply on this as this required some diligence. Though I had reached out to you same day you posted this review to better understand from you personally. Please accept my sincere apology for the delay in servicing you. I have reminded my staff about the process on walk in and appointments again.\n\nI was and am more disturbed about the "B" word you mentioned and that is why, without going deep into the incident, I immediately reached out to you. However, I did not get any response. I take pride in my staff and their training and professionalism. They all are very polite. Still I doubted and reached out to few clients who were their when you visited. They all speak hindi very well and they did not hear any "b" word by our staff. So there may be some misunderstanding and I would like to meet you in person to assure you that if there is slightest disrespect, none of my staff would be working at Aarna. We take customer service very seriously and I am proud that we have been consistently providing highest level of service to our clients since last 5 years.\n\nI would like to invite you to Aarna again and provide us a chance to serve you with highest professionalism.\n\nWarmest Regards,\nRitu'}< /response>< gmapID>

< review>
I went in to have my hair colored with henna. Usually I do it myself but I thought I'd try them since they're just down the street from my house, right next door to where I buy henna. The person who did my hair was nice and proficient. The lady who I'm assuming it's the owner checked on her frequently like she was in training or something. The place was clean which I appreciated.

What got me irritated is after the service they advertise as $30 I was told would be $45 because of my hair length. This wasn't discussed beforehand. Also my hair comes past my shoulders but not to the middle of my back. When I pointed out to the owner that my hair was the same length as hers she said, "Well I have fine hair. Yours is thicker."  She hadn't even touched my hair!

And I completely understand charging more if more work is required but there should have been a discussion beforehand and I know it only costs me about $6 to buy the henna I need for my hair. I've also been to another shop and had it done before for less. She wanted to get over on me but I know it should not cost $50 (including tip) to get my hair colored only. No wash or anything. They only put the henna in. I had to wash it out myself.

No thank you!<//review>

<review>Durga and Neelu are my favorite people here. They give excellent customer service, very friendly and nice.

The best is the job that they do. Eyebrows are done in an excellent manner by both of them. Very symmetric neat and they listen to your inputs on how u want it.

I've been going to Durga for the last two years. She's the best and not once has she spoilt my eyebrows which is a feat in itself. Every single time spot on she gets it.

Durga was not available and i tried Neelu once and she's also absolutely awesome. Very kind and neat job at what she does. Dedicated to make sure she does it to completion even if she's tired and it's end of the day.< /review>< user_name>

Finally!!! there is great Indian salon with quality service!!!  I know Ritu for few years now... She was at the salon in Sunnyvale before... Now she opened up her own brand new salon.  But, she is still very sweet and kind as always. She strongly believes in customer service...  She uses the best products specially the organic ones...  The other girls working there are also very nice...  I highly recommend this Salon !!!< /text>

Only 4 star because I would say the girls could do a lil a better at greeting customers/making the sign in /payment process a little more friendly. "Hello how are you" and a smile goes a long way. They are always nice to me , but I see some ladies walking in looking a bit lost and uncomfy.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

It feels to me as if over the years aarna's punctuality with online appointments has gotten drastically better. These ladies (esp Pooja and Rekha) have helped me with the best shaped brows of my life. And it's an amazing price!< /text>

First day I went for cleanup and herbal mask. It was relaxing. The lady was good at her job.
Second day I went for herbal hair spa. It was so horrible. The lady was sick with cold (OMG isn't this place supposed to be hygienic?!) She did not wash off the herbal mast neatly. There were lumps of dried mask in my hair! The last thing I want is to walk out of salon feeling dirty and smelly! I was smelling like herbs after the spa and she asked me not wash the dried remains of mask for that one day! Wow! I was supposed to attend a party that night. That is the reason I went for hair spa! I can't be smelly and carrying dry lumps of some herbs in a party!
Both these stars are for the lady who did my face cleanup!< /review>

I recently started going to Aarna threading salon based on a friends recommendation and I was pleasantly surprised at the fantastic service I received. Previously I've had some extremely bad experiences with parlors in the Bay area (refer khoobsurat) where I've been cut during threading and had a bad waxing experience, but Aarna's was just amazing. The products they use are of good quality, especially the cream wax that helps reduce growth substantially. I really liked Rekha's waxing, she was patient and took extra care of removing all the unwanted hair. Roohi's threading skills are also commendable always super patient and happy to redo left out spots. Overall Aarna's salon uses great products and has some hard working staff. I will recommend this parlor to everyone.</Text>

I have followed Ritu from the chair she used to rent in Sunnyvale to her swanky new salon in Santa Clara. She has always been thorough and patient, be it hair color, hair style, keratin treatments or waxing. She is very good at what she does and very accomodating. Her prices are very reasonable and it is really hard to find this combination along with a clean, modern salon atmosphere.</Text>

Rob (Manager) is the best! Got me in and out in less than 2 hours for 4 new tires, a complicated alignment, full inspection, and personal review of my 1998 Dodge 2500 4x4. Excellent staff✅ Tires are A/Ts but work GREAT in the snow! AndyG 😎</Review>

They are ALWAYS friendly, helpful, honest, efficient and complete items in a timely manner. I purchased tires about a year ago, had a nail/screw in one and came in using the warranty. After getting brand new tires, the next day I had an issue w/one, went back and because the screw was in the side wall they replaced the tire 100%. Havent had a bad experience as long as I have been taking my tires to them!</text>

I dropped my vehicle off at 9:13am and I didn't drive off until 5:40pm. I am happy with the quality of work that they do at Les Schwab but I didn't expect shocks, an alignment and a rotation to take 8 hours. The customer service is phenomenal as I usually experience when I visit a Les Schwab at any location across the country.<//Review>

Thank you Dominic for making sure my tires were balanced correctly. I will no longer go to les swab in victorville /ADELANTO.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Jacob was phenomenal, he answered the phone before they're even open with pep and vigor. It was quite helpful and led me into the direction to not only save money but to get the most value out of the tires. The young lady at the front was also quite nice. I could say that I honestly enjoyed my experience and the three hours that I waited for the service will be completed flew by with the help of HGTV. If you are in need of tires please consult Jacob, he will not steer you towards the most expensive Tire oh, he will evaluate your needs and give you the tires that you need :-)< /Review>< userid>

I will drop the 4 stars. Hi jacob(the manager). They guarantee the job. We will see. Only lost 5 pecent of new tires ! 😂🤣😂🤣😿😢😂😭😭😭 so everyone always double check & come back. ..(ASK FOR ROTATION ON TIRES. not free or included)  But  they say they will fix the problem. Good people here.
Update: 5 stars. Thank you jacob. You have earn a customer for life. After new suspension, new struts, new tires, new brakes, new calipers. I need a company to really depend on. Thank you!

Made appt for 1 tire. Showed up and they had never even ordered the tire! Waste of time and gas!  They wanted to order the tire and schedule a new appt during week when I work. Leaving on road trip in 1 week and had to scramble to find somewhere else for a tire. Never again</review>

I went in for "4" new tires oil change and alignment. Tires wonderful oil changed, alignment whole different story.
To
make long story short I was told I had lots of damage and needed 1200.00 worth of parts and labor before they could do the alignment. Thank goodness I took it home and had my brother and son in law check it and guess what there was nothing WRONG took it to another shop had alignment done no problem.I feel they were trying to take a 65 y/o widow to the cleaners< /Review>

<Review>What's the point of a appointment If you don't start until 1hour after the appointment. Two hours for JUST tires.

< review>
Decided to give this company a shot since my left front tire was low on air. Got there and waited a good while there since it was packed. The employee comes and tells me my tire had to two small slashes on the inner wall.... debating if i should buy a 130$ tire since they retail around 70-60$ .... i asked them just to put back my tire on and noticed new damage to my rim!<//review>

<Time>1589594110118<//Time><Text>I went to Pep Boys and was denied service due to being close to closing time. Decided that I would try Les Schwab before I attempt the long drive home on a spare. I pulled up at 5:50pm, 10 minutes before closing time. I was greeted by Rob who said it would be no problen to help. He repaired my tire, which I was expecting to replace, and had me on my way faster than expected. This is the definition of "world class" customer service. Simply amazing!</Text>< user_name>

Great customer service, respected my budget and was super fast. I called around different tire shops up in Hesperia and I liked the price and phone interaction here the best. They corrected my previous and wrong understanding of bad tires without making me feel incompetent. Will definitely be back for my other 2 tires. Thanks!!< /Text>

My car never leaked before taking in on for a wheel alignment, when they did the wheel alignment, Iowa's told the rack in pinon boots were leaking badly and unwound need to replace it, at the cost of $1000. When the car was brought out of the bay both sides were still leaking.... checked the power steering pump and the fluid level was still full. I drive home and checked it again with same results full. Don't know what they did but I believe they poured oil all over the boots to make me think it needed to be replaced, cleaned up and washed the oil off and I still have not yet seen a oil leak. What a scam of a shop. I will never take my car back to this shop. I called auto zone and the part was only $160. U called another les Schwab location and they said it would be only about$500 for parts and labor. Wow big difference in prices here. Sorry I had to give them a 1 star because there is no 0 stars
Nate, FYI there is still no leaks after cleaning the rack and boots power steering fluid remains full. There was absolutely no leaks before bringing in my car, and still no leaks after driving a couple hundred miles. There is nothing wrong with it. So the question is where did the fresh oil come from, as it didn't come from the rack and pinion</text>

Best service I have received in a very long time! I called in and talked with Jacob and explained to him that the sound I was hearing from my tires was a little unnerving. I drove into the parking lot and before I got out I was greeted by a salesman. High fives to Seth and the other gentlemen who worked diligently getting my tires on my 2000 Honda Civic EX Coupe. The short drive home was quiet and smooth. Thank you guys and gal for the superb service! I highly recommend them!!<//Review>

Seth Austin & whoever else hustled to get my tires rotated but more importantly the hustle that went into getting to trailer tires fixed so I can get a co-worker off the 15 freeway was even better thank you again much appreciated! #OUTLAW</Text>

Hands down the best tire shop I’ve ever been too. Was greeted in the parking lot and by Mario and immediately he went to work to figure out our problem and find the best, most inexpensive solution. The entire place is clean, professional and has the customer in mind before anything else, and the prices are the best I’ve found anywhere especially for the quality of work and customer service you receive. I highly recommend Les Schwab.< /review>

I needed a tire patch and alignment. I was promptly greeted in the parking lot by a friendly employee. The alignment price was about the same as competitor prices but the patch was free.  All the employees were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to have my business. They have 8 service bays.   Four  in the front and four in the back.  This location just opened last week as of this posting. They had coffee and popcorn as well as vending machines.   There's also a Wendy's in the parking lot if you need a bite to eat if waiting for your vehicle.  All tire shops try to upsell but these guys were not pushy at all.  They're just doing their job. I'll definitely be back.< /Review>

Spent a couple hours tweedle dumming with the air in our tires before beginning our 10 hour trek home from California, finally decided maybe someone at a tire center would actually know how to deal with tires (novel idea) and Tony waved us in, gave us the rundown on what was happening, filled up our tires, shook hands and wished us good luck. We were charged nothing, nicest guy since Tony the Tiger from cereal.</Text>

Very disappointed, I spoke with a sales rep a month back about getting tires for my truck and he clearly knew alot about offroad tires and gave me 10 or so different options. I was ready to buy them and the sales lady gave me only two tires for an option that were way higher than what I was previously quoted. Im going to Americas Tires $200 less for a better tire of the same size. You guys lost a $1500 sale due to your sales lady being lazy and having an attitude. She worked 1/2 at 1:00pm just didnt get the name.< /text>

At Les Schwab we don't take shortcuts when it comes to brakes or any other service, which can cost a bit more up front.  We like to provide some peace of mind with a very complete brake service, as well as a 3 year or 25,000 mile warranty that covers both parts and labor.  That is something that is hard to find elsewhere.  I hope we have an opportunity to serve you in the future.  - Nate"}</Response></record>

<review>Les Shwab is the best tire shop I've been to hands down there prices might be a bit more but completely worth it all there tires a have the best warranty plus the customer service is the best they come running to your car as soon as you pull in and they have diagrams of how bad your alignment is and how they leave it when your done to ensure that the job was done right and they also take good care of your wheels they even wash them after being worked on so I'd recommend this spot to anyone who needs tires or a quick patch< /review>< Pics>

<review>I took my car to get new tires because i already had my spare on the car.i asked them to keep my spare and replace my 2 bad tires.while waiting i could see one of the workers pointing at my tires and laughing.he even grabbed 2 other co workers to show them whatever was so funny.they were just looking and laughing not even qorking on my car.then they took my spare left my flat in the truck.and when i pointed out the mistake the worker tried to blame me for not telling the lady at the front desk.and tried to blame the lady in the front for writing up the order wrong.then after waiting for them to fix the problem none of them apologized.not even a have a nice day.nothing.who wants to spend almost 200 dollars to be laughed at and be belittled.thanks no thanks.will never go back.< /review>< pictures>

<review>HORRIBLE, my daughter had a 1pm appointment to have her brakes replaced. I had to call them at 4:45 PM and tell them they needed to replace my daughters brakes.  My question, why did she have to wait 3+ hrs and I have to call and tell them they need  to get the brakes done. Also why do they take walk ins before appointments?< /review><Time>1539133713490< /Time>< user_name>

<Review>Clean facility, and typical gym management aside from Tamara. This woman has somehow ended up in a customer service management role. You get sent straight to her with any billing mismanagement issues (plenty during closures and reopenings), or cancelation requests, and she has zero patience for any amount of feedback or discussion on the agreement (which you will not have explained to you or given to you for review). It's so unfortunate to have my last impression of this facility to be interacting with somebody who has no business being in a customer facing role. Happy to cancel< /Review>< Pictures>

We’re so glad you're enjoyed your workouts with us and we hope to work out with you again soon!"}< /Response><review>Wow, I'm not a member here yet but I will say I came away very impressed with this gym.  What brought me here is that I recently became a Certified Personal Trainer.  I'm touring different gyms trying to get a good feel for the environment, equipment, staff, etc..., as I am trying to enter the Health and Fitness Industry as a personal trainer.  Today, I decided to use my free 1 day pass before it expired.  Let me say the tour blew me away.  The environment is very welcoming!!  It's not over crowded, the music isn't blasting, and it doesn't have that lingering stinking gym smell.  It's very clean!!

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by professional, friendly and courteous staff (Dylan and Eric).  Eric is a former football player, we talked sports for a few minutes.  Cool dude!!  Dylan (who is also cool) gave me a guided tour of the gym, both upstairs and downstairs which was nice.  Dylan who is very knowledgeable (might I add), went over the exercise programs they offer there at Crunch.  Everything I could think of they have.  Kettlebells, medicine balls, free weights, machine weights, functional/cross training equipment.

I'll conclude this by saying I'm working on a budget right now trying to make room to buy a membership.  Leaving there without one made me feel empty :-(<//review>< user_id>

<Review>This gym is amazing first of all they're very strict with who comes in and who goes out monitoring it so it doesn't get an overflow the cardio is downstairs the restrooms are Immaculate the locker room is clean everyone there looks fit and the equipment is enough to turn you into what you want to be a highly recommended what I love about it is that the atmosphere has a nightclub appearance it's beautiful go take care of yourself< /Review>< pics>

I joined on March 4, 2021. I have all copies of emails available for review. I have continually asked Erick for confirmation that my membership was cancelled and asked for when my last day would be. I have 4 unanswered emails of Erick completely ignoring my request for cancellation as well as my request to escalate the issue to the correct personnel. I refuse to be charged another day for that membership - it is an absolute shame the type of service Erick and his team member Thomas have provided. I called Thomas at the phone number he used to call and text me - he answered and said that it was not him and I had the wrong number. This team is a disgrace. Please cancel my account effective March 22, 2021. Please reach out to me via email for all email copy evidence and a review of your management team. 0/10.<//Text>< pictures>

I even went to this gym from San Jose when the gym reopen, and I asked him how to cancel the membership and he said “Just send your ID barcode to me”, and I did it so many times. But he never respond back until now. I don’t understand why and what is going on. Although this gym is well equipped and I liked to workout there, I’m really disappointed with them. He doesn’t take responsibility for the job.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate>< pictures>

<text>I canceled my membership on December 17th because I was moving out of state.  I submitted my proof of address change to refund my membership over 8 weeks ago (I paid cash for the year). I called and spoke with Eric several times and have written three messages to Tamara Vinay and copied the corporate customer service email on the second and third messages.  I have not received one response. Completely unacceptable after Eric telling me over and over it was being taken care of.  Takes two seconds to send an email with an update.< /text>< pics>

They were keep charging during pandemic when they were closed. When they reopened, I tried to cancel my membership several times. First I called the gym several times and  requested to speak with someone. They say that managers are not available at the moment, they get all my information but no one calls me back.I tried sending emails, but no luck there either. Finally I went to the gym directly and filled the form. Now my membership is supposed to be canceled, but then I am keep getting charged.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Short version: unavoidable hidden charges, I was charged 14 months of prorated annual fee for 40 days of gym usage.

I enrolled at San Mateo Crunch on 02/01/2020. I requested to freeze my account on 3/10 since covid-19 made me feel uncomfortable to go to the gym. Crunch closed on 03/16 due to the shelter in place order and froze all accounts automatically. In June they reopened but I requested to keep my account frozen because I heard that wearing a mask wasn’t mandated in the gym and I still didn’t feel safe to go. At this time I was informed that I would be charged for the full amount of the annual fee again. I requested to cancel my membership but they said the annual fee would be charged regardless.

They said the annual fee was supposed to be charged 90 days after enrollment. However, due to this year’s special situation, the gym hadn’t even been open for 45 days at that point from the time I joined. At enrollment, I was charged for two months of a prorated annual fee, and then I was charged the entire annual fee again later. By the time they reopened in June and I was thinking about canceling my membership, I was charged for 14 months annual fee for my 40 days usage of the gym.

I tried to argue with them, but the San Mateo location said that the annual fee was charged “by corporate policy” and that I had signed an agreement at enrollment. They gave me an email address to contact their corporate office, but the email response was extremely slow and unhelpful (they forwarded me back to the San Mateo location). The San Mateo location has also started being unresponsive since I raised this problem and still has not forwarded me a signed copy of my agreement.

I feel super humiliated at this time. In order to argue with them, I’ve spent lots of time working out the timeline and going back and forth with them, only to be stonewalled. All the sales people were nice and aggressive to push me in, but became silent and unhelpful once they got my money and earned their commission.

I understand that the whole gym industry is going through hard times and needs money. However, simply passing the burden to their customers is not moral and doesn’t make any sense. All I want at this point is the prorated annual fee (which I have been double charged) to be refunded because I’m also going through hard times.

For people who are already members or thinking about enrolling, I would recommend you be careful about this decision. Always watch out for hidden fees, because even keeping your account frozen and not using the gym at all will generate annual fee every year. In the current situation, it might not be safe to go to the gym for a long time. Right now, even though they are not providing you any service, you still have to pay the annual fee anyway.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1597762897029, 'text': 'Hey Chang, thank you for your review.

This is the cleanest, nicest gym I have ever been to.  The first time I ever walked in I immediately felt comfortable and not judged like I have often felt at other gyms.  The staff are always friendly and my personal trainer is awesome.  I really appreciate the laid back vibe.  Before covid, I had a training session every Thursday at 4pm, and every single time there was always a hard working gentleman thoroughly cleaning all of the glass walls, mirrors, surfaces, etc.  This was before covid.  Previously, I went to 24-hour fitness and it always looked and felt grimy and the vibe was not as friendly.  I haven’t been back yet since they re-opened because I was on vacation and then had a foot injury, but I feel confident that they are and will maintain a clean, safe environment during this crisis and I can’t wait to return.< /Review>

No temperature check. Masks optional. At least 1/2 of clients on 2nd weight room floor don't wear any and are not carrying any. Many don't social distance. Equipment  is placed a few feet from each other making it impossible to social distance. COVID 19 is spread by droplet and probably aerosol. Makes no sense not to require masks at all times.

Communal disinfectant bottles that everyone touches. Makes no sense to spray down equipment with bottles that everyone touches.

Manager never leaves office for good reason...

< review>
COLLEGE STUDENTS DO NOT GO HERE! The majority faculty here are extremely lazy and are incompetent at their job. The gym is most often dirty and unsanitary while the staff just talks to each other. It is expensive to go here and not worth the price for what you get. I tried cancelling my membership multiple times when I went back to school for the semester and although I filled out numerous forms confirming my cancellation, their staff did not process the forms, resulting in me being charged for months. Then when I recognized the charges while I was at school, they wouldn’t allow me to cancel my account until December when I got back from school because of their bs policies. Do not go to Crunch in San Mateo unless you want to be scammed.<//review>

<text>I workout with my trainer here and it is a great gym with lots of equipments that even during peak hours you won't have to wait. They have fun classes throughout the week which comes along with a $50 monthly membership fee. Trainer classes are really very pricey here, but the trainers are great and work really hard with you. The gym has a nice sauna which I love! If they can have a swimming pool as well, it will be perfect.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Just being honest the showers use the spray down with some Tilex, pink sludge on the curtains and walls 🤢 I could go on but that alone is bad. I also think it's kind of funny how they reply to the good reviews but not the reviews with legit concerns of the gym & staff</Text>

<Text>This place is run by egotistical LIARS, BULLIES, CROOKS and THIEVES. Don't be fulled by a nice facility.I'm a veteran of 5 years active duty in the United States Navy, and a current student for sonic engineering. I put my pants on one leg at a time just like ever other individual. I have a normal routine and am just another human trying to survive and coexist with the rest of the world. Some time ago when I got out of the Navy, I move back home to the Peninsula and decide to check this place out. Not only are their prices for a limited number of accessible facilities, but its run by some of the most elitist characters I've come across. About 5 months ago, I go into the gym to physically cancel my membership only to be told that the only way for me to cancel my membership is via email. Ethically, this option is not sound. The boy at the front desk not only gave me attitude but also failed to mention that there is a cancellation form that can be filled out(Even though I specifically asked about this. I leave without being able to freely cancel my membership and at the point call my banks and have them block Crunch's forceful payment charges. Fast forward til now, I receive a call from debt collectors saying that I owe Crunch $250 for a gym membership that is continued to be forced onto me to this day that I do not use. So I call the gym and explain the situation and get onto the phone with an individual by the name of Eric. Another privileged elitist who things the world revolves around him. I'm in a very specifically tough situation currently and explained it to him, only to get a comically heartless response of I should have sent an email. THE WORST PART is that now they have a cancellation form as a cancellation option (which they did not allow me to originally sign). BUT.. When I was contacted by the debt collector, they told me that the only way to cancel was via email EVEN THOUGH the gym is now saying filling out a form at the gym is an option(That I was intentionally not given.) I will NOT be paying for what has been forcefully bullied into my life. WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND ITS SAD THAT THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS UNWILLING TO HAVE A LITTLE EMPATHY FOR THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. I've already initiated multiple channels of complaints and other processes to protect myself and my credit from these cheating thieves. Side note, 24 Hour fitness charges the same if not less, for nationwide membership to ALL of their facilities. Spend your money wisely elsewhere.</Text>< Pics>

Decent gym. As a powerlifter, the equipment is marginal. One platform and 2 squat racks. So there are often waits to use the good equipment. The quality of the equipment is good. Decently clean and well managed.< /Review>

Been using this gym for the past 3 months and it is great! It has all kinds of equipment, clean bathrooms where they use premium products, lot of lockers, parking and also a Steam room (though I never used it). They give clean towels and you can hire personal trainer too. It is expensive gym but all these features make it worth it to me.</Text>

As far as gyms go, it's pretty good, apart from the music perhaps, but the thing that takes it to the next level are the yoga class instructors, such as Keith, Eileen, Felicia and Ben. Really top notch each with his/her own style. Good yoga space.<//Review>

< Review>
Worst customer service! People who work there including the Manager was very rude and not helpful when I approached them for cancelling my membership.  I was given different directions every time I called, didn't get a response when an email was sent. I had not used the gym even for one day after I joined - I was told I cant achieve my goals if I didn't take the personal training and I would regret it and be the same after couple of months.  Honestly the gym was clean and had good equipment's and I was very excited except for the people who work there, as they just want to force everyone into taking a PT and make money. I only wish we had this conversation before my card was swiped!</Review>

<Review>Hidden fees that are not disclosed, extra charges that are not refunded even after 3 months. You need to follow up week after week...

They should replace James Lopresti. He’s incompetent for his position and is mostly responsible for us canceling our membership. He first was not honest about the cost and fees about adding my partner to my membership. Their system was down. He described the terms and conditions and did not mention any fees, only an additional charge each month for an add on member. To our surprise there were extra fees and an extra charge due to a system error for which I was not refunded. I’ve never seen the contract or the refund after 3 months. We were fed up with the incompetency and decided to freeze our accounts. We were told that our account was frozen but then we were charged the next month and learned that there is an extra charge for freezing - which again he did not disclose even when we specifically asked. It goes on and on.. It’s an OK gym and other staff is nice. But, this guy..</Review>< Name>

<Text>Crunch, San Mateo has the worst General Manager customer service I have ever encountered.

He was rude, abrupt, subjective and animated while raising his voice to a member of more than 5 years with 7 members in my account and more than 120 referrals over the years.

I called in to get help and unfortunately, the "General Manager named Mike" made matters worse.

Crunch in San Mateo is a reputable establishment that does not need to have their name tarnished due to a WEAK conduct of an unprofessional  General Manger.<//Text>< Date>

<name>Gail Morag</name><Text>When they say their values are inclusive and kind , where does that come from ? Awful service, draconian rules (for cancellation).

<Text>This place has been around for over 30yrs minimum and have yet to fail in product and service they provide. They even outlasted Costco tires when I compared and dared to go elsewhere. Never again! Their prices are the best around. Their customer service is friendly and quick. 🙏< /Text>< resp>

Been a loyal customer for years and now they're giving me the run around. Spent over 1,000 dollars in work and then they say they fixed the problem yet the problem remains the same. Always trying to clown in Spanish thinking we don't speak Spanish. Very disrespectful and disappointed.</text>

I took a rim to get fixed and, not only did they take 3 days but they did a horrible job. On top of the weld they put silicone, I guess just so that I think they fixed the rim. Would not recommend going there<//Text>

Hands down the best tire shop I've been to and believe me I've been to several in that area. I got 4 Goodyear tires for my Corolla at an awesome low price and was out of there within 20 minutes. Thanks guys I will definitely be back and will definitely recommend you to friends and family</Review>

Terrible place, First of all their so called tire shop looks like a nightmare, I don't understand how they can work in a dirty environment like that. and second of all they enjoy ripping you off. Needed a valve stem replaced and they wanted to charge me $10.00 to replace the stem core itself. $10 dollars for something that costs 50 cents at the auto parts store come on I'm not stupid.<//review>

The place became a rip-off tire shop so suddenly. Small puncture on a tire, my son was charged $20.00 to get it fixed when they usually charge $10.00. The guy told him, it is because the tire is dirty and has to be cleaned when my son just washed the car! Wow! Well damage been done & never that I come back nor recommend this tire shop again! NeVeR!!!< /review>

<Review>So 5 and Below is a store targeted primarily for the youth (ages 8-17). I had never been into one until about a year ago when our girls asked me if I would take them to get a couple items. It basically was like if you took a Nickelodeon version of Hot Topic, a Disney version of Spencer's, the electronics dept of any drugstore/pharmacy, and the junk food/candy aisle at the 99¢ store and put them together- That is $5 and Below... Clean, friendly associates, self checkout only(thank God).<//Review><username>Derrick Laub< /username></record>

<rate>4</rate><Review>I am revising my review as my first review was one star. After spelling out my every grievance on google reviews a supervisor called me and rectified the situation post haste! I leave 4 stars because the issues should have never taken place to begin with. The professionalism and expediency of the supervisor was astonishing and a stark contrast to what I had come to think of as the norm for this firm. Thank you for fixing things Michelle!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1621462025070, 'text': 'Timothy, thank you for giving Michelle the opportunity to speak to you and make it right.

I spoke to the manager Yvonne regarding my case with PLB law office. I was very happy she returned my call and she was very understanding of my level of stress. Her compassion regarding my situation and her knowledge of what was going on with my case put me at ease. Thank you flor for being so very kind and Yvonne for your insight. Kudos to the both of you. I would encourage anyone who has a workers comp case, consider this law firm< /Review>

<review>They are truly one of the best law offices around. I came to PLBSH looking for help and that's exactly what I was given. Straight forward and truly one of the hardest people fighting for you.<//review>< pictures>

I was given little information about what was going on with my workman's comp case. And I feel the lawyer handling my case was just In a rush to clear his desk. Now I'm stuck with a permanent disability and was given peanuts. GO ELSEWHERE FOR HELP<//Review>

I recommend this law firm, they have represented me in 2 cases and I couldn't be happier in the way they handled both cases. The ladies in the office were always nice and professional, they always returned my calls and if they didn't have the answers to my questions then they got the correct answers and returned my calls, most cases take time and you need patience and let the professionals do their job, thanks again for your hard work, I would recommend these guys<//review>

The law office as a whole was incredible. My case was handled smoothly by  professional & knowledgeable people. I trusted them and it was a stress-free case on my part. They discuss, they advise, they answer your
questions, they give updates and they are friendly. My expectations were greatly met. I highly recommend Law Offices of Perona, Langer, Beck Serbin, Harrison. Thank you for helping me. Good luck to you all!<//review>

Hassan represented me in my worker's comp. I felt assured with him. They took the time in helping me with my options and were communicating regularly with updates on my case. A bit hard to get a hold of the person in charge but someone is always there to answer questions.
Thank you Hassan<//review>

They represent me on my Worker Comp.
It last over a year to close the case, communication with them was good.
It was hard to connect with the person in charge,  ither not in the office or away from the phone. Always the voice mail, but I do received the call back from them.
Within 24 hrs.  For my it took too long to complete the paperwork after I sign  the release document.<//Review>

<Text>This Law Office helped me and I am very happy and pleased with their service. They were always very professional, very informative.

The attorneys on my case - both the one that helped at the deposition and the one that communicated with me - both were excellent, friendly and helpful.

Due to high volume of cases they handle, it is hard to reach people on the first attempt however, they do return calls and handle the issues.

Highly recommend them!<//Text>< Pictures>

Straight to the point, I knew of this law firm because my uncle had case or two with them and always a big success. So I thought heeey I can call them. I did call for my workers comp case and day one was the only day I felt like I had the best attorneys. Well there after no questions answered, the answers from staff were iffy and not assurances due to for reasons they were playing roles on phone they shouldn't have. For example I asked how much is my case worth? Sad to say no one could ever answer. Lets move to court date I get there no one there to talk to me muuuhm then few minutes before court this man calls my name after I noticed him coming in like ten minutes before court. Ok so we go to this room no introduction of his name just the name of attorneys office with a hostile authoritative demeanor fast talking and he just starts telling me this ok this is what you are gonna get you take it or you leave it, (why in the hell did it seem like I got offered the attorney's percentage) and no the judge is not going to give you no future medical so forget it also and the judge will not grant this as a huge injury you didn't loose no limbs so that's that.....I was devastated to hear how he spoke to me and to think what a freaked up way to be speaking and I signed those papers because that man who represented the law firm made me sick to my stomach to think that's how the business is being done WOW .....after getting 2,970.00 I felt as thou I should have did my homework on attorney's and know because they were good back in day don't mean there are still good and just because the business says their name it don't mean its the name didn't change or joined in with another things to inform clients and not pass out pens and other items in other names...To attorneys you leave a message to contact you NOoooo for what, if you want to look in to it .Look in to it you got the records.<//text>

I have read through most of the reviews. Unfortunately my experience was not a good one. I was not treated well by Sonia, she has little to no knowledge, had no interest in getting me any of the information that requested and thereby I was left always hanging. My phone calls/voice messages were usually responded to only after various messages were left and even than Marlen, Sonia or Claudia never could give me an answer or response to my request. I realize Workers Comp is a slow process and there are certain steps that need to be taken. As the Attorneys office of record there should be no reason for me to have to call my adjuster, who by the way wont speak to me because I have an attorney and her direct supervisor who did speak to me to resolve an issue. In my opinion the ladies in which I the client has direct and regular contact with should be more acquainted with the intricacies of what is happening, will be happening and the procedures to make it happen.< /Review>

<Text>I have a case with them and I am unhappy with the service.  Everything they do is very slow.  It took them several weeks to even send me to a doctor. They had the wrong address for insurance company to send me my paperwork. Just everything they do is so slow, there is no sense of urgency. To see a State doctor took them 6 months to set that up.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>This morning Eric Schwartz represented me in a Workman's comp case.  I wasn't happy...Oh, I loved Eric and the settlement he got me. $10,000.00 Thrilled!!! No, I wasn't happy because I had to get the money from the insurance company and not the creeps who treated me so badly at my 2 year 6 month job. So, I recommend him highly. If you're like me and hold grudges against your old employer. You will have to settle for a bunch of money and no personal revenge. My Shrink tells me I should meditate. He's probably right.< /Review>< pics>

Had the extremely diligent team of Patrick and Leonard. The communication can sometimes be lacking do to their sheer volume of clients. That being said if you trust and patiently wait for the process to take place, the results are phenomenal. Trust in the process no matter how tough the case might be going and it won't surprise you when the results are worth it. Thanks guys did awesome job!< /review>

I had a great experience with the Firm as they were honest and upfront with every aspect of my case.  Eric Schwartz represented me like a lawyer should, I would definitely recommend P.L.B.S.H to any one that has been injured while working.< /review>

Great service. I have to call everytime to get an update on my case. I was always able to speak with someone in the office & if I can’t get a hold of anyone, they will always call me back. I had an amazing experience with them. My attorney was so nice. He answered every question I had. I totally recommend this Law Office🙌🏽</Text>

I worked with Patrick Hawkins and Jon Dodart on a claim - they teamed up together beautifully, and got me significantly more than I was expecting in a settlement at our deposition. These are both professionals that you want on your side when you are dealing with a system as complex, bureaucratic and unfriendly as the California comp system.   I would strongly advise against trying to navigate the system on your own - there are too many nuances and traps that liability insurers will try to lure you into and then use against you.  It’s reassuring to have a team that is always available to advise as the process unfolds - for instance, when someone shows up at your door and wants to take a recorded statement and have you sign away permission for them to access ALL your medical records, it’s unsettling and can be intimidating, especially when they are positioning it not as an ask but as a requirement.  Patrick and Jon were able to talk me through the situation and assure me that I wasn’t obligated to give them any information (and they subsequently made sure that all communication went through them).

They both were sensitive to what I felt what was in my best interest   - they were willing to try to settle before the deposition because I didn’t want this to drag on, but advised that settlements often happen quickly if you show up.  Patrick set everything up from his office, and Jon showed up and walked me through what to expect.  Before I knew it, he and the opposing lawyer had secured a settlement twice as high as I expected - Jon advised me the pros and cons of taking the settlement, and I knew quickly that this the best scenario given how timeI-intensive a case would be.  Because I had been set up so well and hadn’t given anything away early on to be used against me thanks to Jon and Patrick’s guidance, we were in a great position. I signed some paperwork that Jon scrupulously reviewed, and got a check a month or so later.

Again - don’t try to do this on your own.  The reduced stress and the likely increased settlement that comes from having such an experienced and helpful team on your side is well worth the contingency.</Text>

<Review>I requested this law firm to represent me in my workers comp case. I can tell you by far im unsatisfied. The front receptionist ladies are unprofessional they have know dignity when dealing with frustrated customers. They pin point every word they dont agree with they dont listen to you they get mad when you treat them in the same exact manner. They have hung up on me and put me on hold and never come back. They want you to limit the amount of calls you make to them but when they want to get ahold of you they go to the furthest extent to get you aware. Natalia Corona I did not give you or your law firm permission to utilize my email it was only to sign documents Now this is my 7th complaint when is it going to. I have an update I still have the same feelings about the front receptionists but i can say maggie has always tried to help me she understands me which not to many people do but she has by far been the greatest< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1591397082169, 'text': 'Could you please email your name and contact info to customerservice@plblaw.com?

PLBSH LAW Firm finished my case in about nine months which I consider a very short period of time. I got a negotiated settlement and my lawyers Jose/ Leonard did an outstanding job settling my case. Also, It did get frustrating trying to get a hold of law office clerks and having to leave messages on their voicemail.However, someone always called me back the same day and were very courteous and professional. Please remember that you are just one of a myriad of clients that this fine law firm represents so please be patient and show the law office clerks the same professionalism they show you. I highly recommend this professional law firm who has a proven track record over many many years taking care of their clients in the communities they represent.</Text>

This is the team to call should you need legal represenation, they're seriously amazing. Working with Todd, Jennifer, and Veronica could not have been more pleasant and team oriented. Their communication skills are off the charts - they respond quickly, explain the process as the case moves along, and keep you in the loop, all of which are critical during such a stressful time. They're professional, brilliant, and hands down some of the coolest people around. Vote for PLBSH!</text>

<Review>The Lawyer they sent to my Deposition fell asleep during the time I was being questioned... This obese man began to snore! The attorneys there for the opposition were in shock.  I did report it to Sonia but nothing came of it.
The assistant Sonia was horrible. They dropped the ball sending me to the wrong doctor not covered by my employer insurance for WC which lost me wages.
Finally Adrianna was a tremendous help. She turned my experience around with her constant updates.  My Lawyer Leonard was a God send. He faught for me.  If they would have been the first people I had to deal with Perona Langer & Beck would get 5 stars!
Over all I want to say thank you for making a horrible time end with a positive note.<//Review>< date>

<text>I had such a great experience with my case. When I called to get advice Randy took down all my information and set me up to meet with Jennifer who was so professional and just an all around great person. She took the time to review my case and was always an email or phone call away. Todd is the attorney that represented me and he was so professional and showed he studied my case. He answered all the questions I had and explained the process. I felt secure and knew I had a great team representing me!
If I would ever have to I would go with Law Offices of  Perona Langer Beck Harrison again and recommend it to anyone looking for a team that really cares about YOU!

They are all prompt to answer any questions. If by any chance I couldn't get a hold of someone they called back almost immediately after.
Everyone so far are very professional. I am very pleased with their service and advices given to me with the attention I deserved.
If I ever where to need them again I am confident that they would take the best care of my case.

Thank you.<//Text>

PLBSH went above and beyond the call of duty to make it easy to deal and work with my case. Please be patient when communicating with the PLBSH team though. They are very busy and have a high case load, so your best bet is to leave a voicemail and wait for a return phone call. they will usually call you back the same or following day. They do not accept emails from you. But will email you updates on your case. I am over all satisfied with the results of my case. They couldn't have done it any better. Thanks guys!< /Review>

My particular case was handled well by the associates, it was the insurance company who continuously denied treatment or any other assistance. Always waiting on them to respond or even acknowledge my injury.
I understand that I’m one of several clients but communication is everything when in any legal case. I did do a lot of my own research on unemployment and disability because Perona stated that wasn’t their field. My case was a workman’s comp. However they should at least have resources or references to offer knowing full well the long process for their clients.
Thanks for the associates who did most of the work and took all my calls and questions.< /review>

I had a great experience with this Law office. Attorney Jerry Chang, was the one who handled my case and was very thorough with me on everything going on at the hearings. He was very understanding, and with his help, he took some weight off of my shoulders when we settled the case. He fights for his clients and I'm satisfied with his attorney services! The staff does take a bit long to return your call but other then that, Marla was great. She was also very thorough and understanding! Overall, I would definitely recommend this Law Firm to anyone. Thank you Law Offices of Perona.<//text>

FIRST I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHERE I WOULD BE IF I DID NOT CONTACT THIS LAW OFFICES . THEY WERE THE MOST KINDEST  PEOPLE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED.I WAS PROVIDED WITH THE BEST DOCTORS AND THERAPIST IN THEIR RESPECTED FIELDS .I WAS REALLY WORRIED THAT MY INJURY WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD FACE ALONE AND WITH NO WAY TO RECEIVE WHAT I WAS IN NEED AT THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF MY LIFE .DO NOT LET ANY MOMENT OF YOU INJURY GO WITHOUT THIS GROUP OF DEDICATED ATTORNEYS.THEY ARE ALL  HALL OF FAME IN MY BOOK. PS I WOULD GIVE THEM 10 STAS IF I COULD.</review>

Perona, Langer, Beck, Serbin, and Harrison are a wonderful firm when it comes to litigation and achieving the proper result. I had a very sticky situation with having a heart attack in the workplace. The company did not want to recognize my efforts as an employee of three years. They also did not want to grant any special accommodations should I return to my previous position. I thank P.S.L.B.S.&H. for their time and effort in seeking justice, and adequate compensation for my difficult challenges with my previous employer. Thank you!</Review>

I'm truly grateful for the help they gave me.they were honestly great and I would recommend them to anyone that needs their help. I was pleased .. because when it was time to put that behind me...they were really great about the way I was represented. I will always say great things about them.

< Review>
When I initially contacted them, it was because of the ratings I had seen of their past performance. But after signing on, I had to deal with extremely rude staff, poor follow up, and Sheila's lies about having called so she doesn't actually have to do her job. I know it's not just me either, because they did the same to an acquaintance I had referred to them. I didn't even know which one was my actual attorney. I was told that the callers were attorneys; they were not. My QME date was changed when they didn't submit all my reports. They filed my case as two, and filed in the wrong county. I waited a year for SOMETHING, and all I got was pushback and uncaring responses to my concerns. I mentioned my concern that I wasn't getting paid or fixed and my family was going to lose our home- they responded with "it's normal, just wait it out." I finally switched attorney's offices, and now I'm actually getting responses- from my attorney, and not a callous office clerk. If you care about your case, and whether or not you will be treated with dignity and care, be cautious...

* Two months AFTER switching business. Two months AFTER calling and asking for a new rep and to speak with the attorney and being ignored... The only time they've shown concern about the above situations is upon receipt of a truthful yet unfavorable review. There were plenty of opportunities to fix the situation before we fired them.</Review>

They didn't really do anything for me. The secretaries are always rude on the phone or they just forward you to "Flor" voicemail. They are pushovers when it comes to court and you will be in treatment for a long time before you even get an MRI. I wouldn't recommend them to anybody ... When I went to court I thought my lawyer was actually working for them,he didn't fight for me. He actually kept pressuring me to sign the paperwork from the other parties. I never had just one lawyer either, I don't know if they are interning. Please do not bother responding to my review, that would be a joke. I wrote it so other people could gain some insight before making the mistake of going to your lawfirm.</review>

Unfortunately, the value of a workers’ compensation claim is determined by the medical determinations made by your physicians, especially the calculation of your disability percentage and prescription for future medical care.  The Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board Judges also use those medical reports when making a Findings & Award or Order of the outcome of injured workers’ claims, and also in determining whether or not to approve the adequacy of settlements.\n\nWe understand and agree that the complex workers’ compensation process may not always seem balanced and fair to injured workers (especially since it does not factor in other frequent hardships that occur after an injury and the pain and suffering that you and your family have endued through this process). Regardless, we do apologize for your dissatisfaction with our firm. Please feel free to contact us and address your concerns with an attorney.'}<//Response><name>Victoria Mello< /name></record>

I’m happy with the firm. Every time I would call I would somebody was always there to answer my questions. The lawyer that represented me, David, was super friendly and made me feel comfortable. He handled my settlement and did a great job. Thanks to David and his firm.<//Review>

Horrible communication from this company. It's run like some kind of processing mill; nobody bothers to check up on your case. Nobody actually reads letters or faxes sent to them, they just have people who open letters and scan them in to your file. Same with faxes. Nobody ever checks for activity on your file so you have to call them and leave a voicemail that nobody listens to  except to pass on a message to someone else that you called. I have been given bad advice that has cost me a  disability paycheck and had to get an emergency hearing that took 2 months meanwhile can't pay rent. Now it  happened again!  The assistants that call you back are not attorneys and are not capable of giving accurate advice. In a year and 3 months I have spoken to an actual lawyer only twice. I have no idea what's going on with my case because nobody bothers to tell me. I have had a work comp case previuously and was updated by the attorney himself (not multiple assistants and multiple attorneys who only glance at your file).<//Text>

<Text>I needed a lawyer to help with a worker's comp case so I contacted an online directory and the firm of P.L.B.S.H called me to ask about my situation. I explained that I live out in Palm Springs and since their office is located in Long Beach would it be a problem to represent me? They had no problem with the distance at all. Once my situation was explained, they told me not to worry about anything, and whatever questions I may have, I can call their office to ask. They work as a team, so I never spoke to one person in particular. But they truly took my needs seriously and fought for me throughout. And they helped me get all that I was expecting. I am definitely keeping them in my contacts list and I would recommend them to anyone needing legal help. One lawyer in particular made my experience even easier. That is Jon. What a stand up guy.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1542755075739, 'text': 'Christopher, thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and for your wonderful feedback about our office and Jon.'}</resp>< GmapID>

I am really upset with my lawyer office.  I have never meet or talk to my lawyer.  I been working with them since January.  I get the run around all the time. Everyone tells me a different story.  If I want to talk to my lawyer it is weeks not days. I am about to lose my home and car I will be homeless. I can't get a job. No money.  They don't care because they have no worries.< /Review>

I went with this Law firm after switching from another lawyer, everything was done over the phone  I never meant my lawyer. I meant my lawyer's assistant when he showed up at my workmen's comp settlement meeting. I didn't even know I was getting a settlement that day, I wasn't informed of what I was signing everything was rushed, so therefore, I signed paperwork not knowing that I could never open my case up again, I didn't find this out till after 2 years of recieving my settlement. I really wish I was more informed on things when it came to my case. I received a fair settlement should have been more though. Overall I  had a good experience with the Law firm.< /Text>

The answering service it's terrible. Unfortunately I got assigned to this attorney a while back. Every time I called to ask regarding my case, the lady whom I was transferred to said someone would call me back or she'd do it herself. She would send me a letter about my "pending" case instead of answering my questions & keeping me updated w/ my case. However, the worst part was when I found out my file was assigned to a volunteer that handles files by starting w/ the letter of my last name. Never in 2 years they would let me talk to the attorney, or meet him. Moreover, after a few yrs on the day of the court for settlement they sent someone else cause "my attorney wasn't available" never knew who the guy was & was not satisfied how he handled my case that morning..all he asked me was if I was sure I didn't want the $ instead of Medical treatment.(Of course they would get a huge chunk of the settlement)...My advice: Do your research before you get to keep an attorney, if you don't meet him, don't hire him!! just a little advice from an experienced injured worker.< /text>

Thank you Mr. Brennan S. Kahn Esq.  I could not have asked for any other attorney to ever represent me. When I met Brennan I knew that I was in the best hands possible to represent me. Brennan felt my pain in the depths of soul. What happened to me was devastating.  When we were at our mediation ... you blew my mind. The strength and passion in your voice speaking for me was one of the most unbelievable moments to experience. See ... I have never crossed paths with somebody who had passion the to fight for me the way I would.. I could keep going but I would be here forever. Thank you Brennan. Ill never forget this moment in life. Made me stronger than ever. One last thing .... I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart to hear about Mr. Langer ESQ.  So sorry. My prayers are with you all. Stay strong and be safe.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1522687291314, 'text': 'Thank you for all the kind words, the review and the prayers.

Educate yourself first.  This law firm has changed for the better, and I am relieved that I will get treatment for an injury that goes back over ten years, except the first time I did not get legal help and wound up being declared "permanent and stationery"  meaning despite the amount of pain I was in at the time, my employer's doctors did not restore me, they just could not go any further in treatment.  Without consistent treatment, I reinjured.  For me, a single mom with three kids -one special needs- depending on me, this law firm ensured that I will now get treatment for my injuries.  I am not placing blame, I am recognizing the system as it works.  I am still in pain, but I know I can be treated once I see my doctors without being penalized.  I did a lot of good work, and with treatment I can continue to do good work for my employer, and know that I can also take care of my family and not cry in my pillow at night because of the pain from being stoic at work and collapsing into bed every night.  I had no life.  I'm getting it back slowly, recovering from the depression caused by pain --, this firm helped me get it back.  Do your part  to get healthy, try to keep positive and patient.  They are working for you.</Text>

The lady flor on the phone was very nice I never met my actual attorney which was interesting. Each court date was a different attorney but the last one was very rushy he didn’t try to fight for what I deserved. I said no to a amount and he’s like it’s only $10k lower. Ummm like excuse me? I have permanent damage and still have to pay you why would you be ok with low balling me just to get it over with? That put a bad taste in my mouth. So because I was just tired after two years I told him no they need to meet me half way or I’ll take it to trial that’s what he went with but I shouldn’t have to do that. I shouldn’t have to suggest to add the denied body part claim as a new claim just so it can count and help me! I just feel having a new attorney each court date is impersonal and doesn’t allow them to get to know you so their defense holds a bit stronger in court.<//review>

<Review>This firm does not communicate well with clients. They do not have good orthopedic referrals, they are not personable. They do not keep clients infomed. They need to value their clients and stop treating them like numbers. Poor at communication, slow with appointments, they do not seem to care about their clients.<//Review>< pictures>

Communication is poor. The law office recieved there check a month before me. I still have yet to get my check. I called in asked to speak with Yolanda the supervisor still waiting to speak with her. Sonya tells me she has called the insurance company but I don't think she is being truthful. Sonya "response is don't call because they will put your check to the side and I don't want that".< /Review>

I transferred my case to this firm after working with another firm that almost lost my case.  My attorney Beck handled my case and swiftly and got me doctors appointments that were very much needed . I received my settlement shortly after . I would highly recommend this firm.

I didn't have a problem with this company. The only issue was that every time I called and left a msg, I would never get a call back. They call you if the need paperworK or extra info. The best thing is when they called me to make sure I received my check.<//text>

This is a very attentive law firm. They always return your telephone calls promptly and they do the best they can for you. Unfortunately, the Worker's Compensation system in California is broken and corrupt. This law firm got me a good settlement, which is the best that can be done while the Doctor's and Judges are corrupt.</Review>

<text>I am very happy to have represented by P/L/B/S/M/H  Worker Compensation   attorneys. For the most part John Brian was my rep. I know they do not have much say in how this all goes down as it is really long drawn out process to the point I just gave up in the end. He did a good job keeping me informed as to what was going on and what choices I had to choose from. If I knew now what I know I would have never bothered with settling as every one and their grandparents want a part of the settlement which is supposed to be used to pay medical bills, but that turned out not to be the process in reality, so I should have just walked away without all the fines and headaches as for me it was never about the money I wanted to get fixed and try to reenter work force. All in all I feel they did a good job though.

Had no issues they got me what they promised, the only issue would be communication, or the lack of.  I feel regular updates would be nice, I know there are sometimes no updates, so than a quick email stating we didn't forget about you, your time is valuable and once we have news we will update you.< /Review>

The lawyer that represented my mom in her case was great. He took the time to explain everything to my mom and to myself. The only thing I wasn't pleased with was the lack of communication between the assistants in the office. Every time I called to check status on the case, they seemed to not have clear answers and weren't very friendly. They always made it seem that it was an inconvenience for them that I called.<//Text>

<Review>I called this firm a year after I injured my back.  I was worried about calling an attorney sooner because we all assume of how high expenses are and already deem the service unaffordable. I was able to call first and get a free consultation on what would happen if I wanted to this firm to represent me and my workers comp case. Right away I was told that I would not pay a cent out of pocket but that the payment for their service would come directly from the insurance company I was dealing with. This gave me a sense of relief and actually over time proved to be totally worth it. I was provided with therapies, medications, and doctors visits almost every week. While the insurance company we were up against refused a lot of treatment I needed to get better, this law firm would push as much as they could for the treatment I needed. I am very satisfied with this service, the only thing I struggled with was getting in contact with attorneys/representatives but I understand that occurs due to having numerous other clients. I would always get callbacks within a few days. Ultimately, my back improved quite a bit afyer my case was over, and I can do a lot more now than I was able to before I contacted PLBSM.< /Review>< Rate>

***ZERO STARS***POOR COMMUNICATION! NOT FAST ENOUGH OR ACTUALLY DOING NOTHING AT ALL. CANT SPEAK TO NOBODY ABOUT ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LEAVE VOICEMAIL EVERY TIME WHICH WHEN DONE THEY DON'T RESPONSE FAST ENOUGH OR DON'T RESPONSE AT ALL.  THEY LIE TO YOU, THEY WASTE YOUR ENTIRE TIME. THEY GOING TO MAKE YOUR CASE A LOT STRESSFUL THAN IT ALREADY IS. I THINK THE PEOPLE ON THE PHONE WHO THINK THEY ARE ATTORNEYS WHICH THEY ARE NOT NOTHING BUT RUDE, NEVER HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU BUT MORE PROBLEMS FOR YOU. YOU CAN TELL THEY HAVE THERE FAVORITES, THAT'S WHY A LOT OF US ARE LEFT TO SPEAK TO A VOICEMAIL.  LEONARD RETTER HAS NO RESPECT, WORST ATTORNEY THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH. LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING & CANT DO NOTHING CORRECTLY. LEONARD RETTER DOSN'T CARE HOW HURT OR IN PAIN YOU IN, HIS IN IT FOR THE MONEY. HE CANT LISTEN TO YOUR OPINION HE DOES WHATEVER HE FEELS HE HAS TO DO WHICH IS NOTHING MOST OF THE TIME. LEONARD RETTER LIES IN YOUR FACE. LEONARD RETTER TALKS BAD ON ALL THE PEOPLE HE REPRESENTS. HE TRIED DOING IT TO ME BUT HAD TO PROTECT & SAND UP FOR MYSELF. IF MY ATTORNEYS CANT STAND UP FOR ME WHO WILL??  I WARN YOU, THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER FIRMS OUT THERE! TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR EVERYONE... THIS ISN'T THE WAY!! ***ZERO STARS****</Text>

I am so disappointed and beyond frustrated with this Firm, I would give them -100 if I could...I have had my WorkersComp case going for 1 year & 9 months now, in the beginning I got quick responses and they were very attentive. As time has passed I am lucky if I get a call back that same day, sometimes even waiting a couple of days for a response. If I speak with anyone other than Sonia they are absolutely no help and their answers are always “I’m sorry, I don’t know.” If I don’t call them I will never know what’s going on with my case. I have YET to even meet or speak with the lawyer who is even assigned to my case! Every time I have gone for a hearing and my deposition it has been a different Lawyer who has showed up and at the hearings they each have only spoken with me no more than 5 freakin’ minutes! My WorkersComp checks have been STOPPED by the insurance company over a month ago so I have had NO INCOME and I can’t even get state disability because my doctor “released” me so I currently have no doctor to help file for my state disability paperwork! When I do get through I keep getting told that they are trying to get me a new doctor yet here we are OVER a month later, still no new doctor and STILL NO INCOME, meanwhile I am in excruciating pain with NO PAIN MEDS because I do not have a doctor to prescribe them for me and my symptoms keep getting worse and worse!!! This has been the most stressful & painful experience and everyday I feel like my employer & their insurance are getting away with their negligence at the cost of my health!!!< /review>

Firm sent my son a letter saying his case was not worth keeping they were through and he should sign letter they sent. He did not. When he went to last hearing in Redding NO ATTORNEY. When Judge called to see why not they told her they were stuck in airport and not about letter to my son saying they would NOT be there. They waited ALL day.

He was very professional and realistic throughout my whole case. He personalized, my case and situation making me feel heard and as if I was a priority. Very convenient for the results that I received. I never had to personally go into the office, all documents and plausible information needed was sent via mail directly to me which was great and worked perfectly with my busy schedule . My needs were being met  every step of the way and if the progress of my case was ever not met or in question I was always contacted. I always stayed in contact and requested updates in my cases regard! sometimes I got call backs sometimes I didn't but overall I got what I wanted. It takes time just know they are working stay on them if you think not! This law office also arranged my therapies and medications etc. accordingly! Such a smooth ride for a awesome ending! I HIGHLY recommend this law office, if and when you find yourself in need! Thank you so much  to the office of Perona, Langer, Beck, Serbin and Mendoza and Harrison!<//Review>< pictures>

<text>This was the biggest mistake we've made. We were never allowed to meet with our attorney and only spoke with his assistant who reassured us that we can proceed with a personal liability case. After almost a year of no progress we insisted on meeting Mr. Langer and at which time he looked at the case and said there isn't anything he could do because the drivers had no insurance! We were shocked and disappointed that they mislead us for almost a year, apparently he had never looked at the case only his secretary reviewed it. He told us we could continue to pursue the workers comp case since there was now there was no personal injury case. We were assigned to Mr. Mendoza who we also didn't meet for almost a year. Every time we called we were not allowed to speak with him and even as the case was closing and we had concerns we were told the only time we could speak to our attorney was at court. To top it off Mr. Mendoza never appeared on behalf of my mother at court he sent his associates! My mother was severely injured and almost died as a result of being ran over by a car while working as a sign twirler. I would never ever recommend this attorney and believe I would have better results had I done the case myself. Be warned read reviews and believe me you will regret it every second if you sign up with this firm.<//text>< Pictures>

Three ups and 3 downs:

THREE UPS -
* Litigation for my case was chosen.  Time to get to that point
was seemingly fast.
* Litigation Attourney (wont mention names) took the time to be
considerate enough sharing events, listening to my input and giving me heads up about any changes.
*The location was close by, so my communte was fast.

THREE DOWNS-
*Their last communication you will will get is when a representative comes out to help you with papaer work for filing. Your in the dark.
* Front staff office is like the rotwiller guard dogs who will kill you with kindness, but NEVER let you physically speak or make an appointment to meet your attourney.
*They do not follow up with anything. In fact I almost thought they forgot about my case, lol.

SUMMERY:  I can only imagine their lack of communication could be to protect you while their case is open representing you. Most people blab.  You're your own worst sharing to family person..so by them not staying in touch, your protected.  When the ay of Litigation arrived, staff members made sure you had no clueless idea of where your to be and when.

I approve as a consumer, the services of this Law Firm.  Please be patient while their staff team  processes your claim. BTW, I won.<//text>

I was working at a retail store when I accidentally hit my foot on a jack. I couldn't walk and needed help so I called Perona, Langer, Beck's office where they made sure my injuries were taken care of. My case was handled by Leonard Retter who was very knowledgeable and kept me up to date. He was very kind and made sure every detail was explained and if I didn't understand something or had a questions my calls were always returned in a reasonable amount of time. I really appreciate Leonard and the rest of the staff here. I would recommend contacting this firm if you've been hurt on the job."</review>

It's assembly line, cookie cutter legal nonrepresentation.  They aren't working even remotely in my behalf. Every 4 months a mandatory settlement comes up and I get a different lawyer who   tries to make me sell my life out like I'm   disposable trash to the workforce. Several times  they were unfamiliar with my case. When they spoke to me they'd ask me basics they should already know!
The last was arrogant  and ill  tempered, much akin to a shyster. Got a mean nasty angry tude when I asked for a trail and got tricky with his semantics, almost misleading.

Still, no trail, no decent settlement, but If I switch firms, they still get  their percentage. Stuck! I feel set up, disappointed, cheated, devalued and with the last weasel, scared. I swear they moonlight for my devil employers.<//text>

They tell you what you want to hear in the beginning and website makes them sound great but they are anything but that. Im not even sure they have real lawyers who work there because your not aloud to talk with them or meet with them. I dont understand why they get paid they have done nothing to help or not even advised on anything in this process, the doctor your sent to are a joke. They need to be sued for misrepresenting themselfs. So disgusted with them. If you are from this law office and are reading this and feel i am wrong and would like to work with us i am open to your help and will adjust this review as needed along with every other post because i will be writing on any and every site available. I dare you to prove you are just not scamming people.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Very rude staff, a culture of lies. Even though request for information is made, you never receive information. As long as your case is assigned, and approved by WC Board, they bill the insurance for payment, whether you receive treatment, or not. What a sham, to earn money from a person's misery. I would give a -10 rating, if possible.< /Text>

I really want to give my upmost gratitude and appreciation to my case worker and the staff at P.L.B.S.M. for helping guide me through this process durring a time when I was in a weak state, both mentally and physically, due to a work related injury. I had no idea what to do when I felt like I wasn't getting the proper care and treatment for my Injury. I literally felt lost and hopeless cause California State Fund was saying I had no impairments and wanted to dismiss my case. You could only imagine how fustrated and bothered this made me feel as if I Wasn't dealing with enough trying to focus on my recovery. Thats when i decided to reach out to P.L.B.S.M. and obtain professional help with my injury. Immediately they got me the medical attention I needed and was able to diagnose the full extent of my injury and prove to State Fund that I had a serious back injury and I was intittled compensation since i was unable to work. As soon as P.L.B.S.M. took over my case, I felt this reassurance that everything was going to be ok. They really had my back like a big brother would and honestly it felt good to have that type of secureness at last. They helped me make sense of everything going on and kept me updated filling me in on what to expect, definitely giving me a sense of direction when I was lost. They allowed me to focus on my recovery and leave the legal matters in their hands. If your dealing with a work related injury then please do yourself a favor and get P.L.B.S.M. on your team you wont regret it.
Thanks to P.L.B.S.M. again for guiding me through the dark and getting me to the light at the other end, my family and I are forever grateful for what your team has done for us.<//review>

< Review>
Worst attorneys.  They spend a lot of money on advertising and hire young incompetent staff.  You will not get good service here.  I fired them today and went with another firm.  My case worker had no concept of the law and is very rude.  She was dishonest on phone, so cios to that firm!!!!!!! They deserve nothing from my case!!!!!!! I only had them for a week.  I spoke with them today and told them I fired them!!!! They never filed a claim, sent me to a doctor, or sent letters of representation!!!!!! They told me they would do all this.  My employer took my medical premiums and never paid my medical premiums, so I am stuck without medical insurance this month.  I spoke to there employment department and they interviewed me and did not think I have an employment case . A different employment firm said I do have a case.  Google ERISA. An employer has a fiduciary duty to maintain health coverage when they take money of out paycheck.   That way upon termination of quitting an employee can have continuous health care coverage with cobra.  This could turn into a class action lawsuit. It is not my job to educate a young 20 year old idiot attorney CA employment law.  I hope this firm carries legal malpractice insurance because I plan to consult a legal malpractice attorney.  I am in pain and they lie about helping a person with medical.  I hope this firm rots in hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have damages from both my employer and Perona and Langer.  I signed up for Covered CA last night, but there will be a month lapse in coverage.  I will not have adequate medical treatment for the month of February.  I have to wait a month until March for my policy to come into effect.   Both my employer and Perona are liable for damages.  Perona has a contract where they send you to Doctors.   They never did that for me.  That is breach of contract.</Review>

<review>I would recommend this company hands-down anytime someone is hurt on the job. This law firm cares about their clients and puts their needs above all. Law Offices of Perona, Langer, Beck, et al. took care of me when others turned me away. I hurt my back at work and it wasn't until I went to Law Offices of Perona, Langer, Beck, that I actually felt like I was being heard as a person and not just a case number. I am very pleased with how they handled my case. I was able to understand everything that was going on with my case and was give updates anytime I needed. Before calling anyone else call Law Offices of Perona, Langer, Beck, et al.  Lenard Retter and Cody Lund were key players in my case both attorneys fight hard and get results.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dd339de2dc00e5:0xe0065fcf04bbd637<//gmap_id>< Name>

Horrible office. I didn't last a month with this firm. I never spoke to or met with an Attorney. The clinic they sent me to, look like an psych ward. I wouldn't recommend this office👎, they use Larry H. Parker name to bait in their clients...< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>(Translated by Google) I left my first lawyer thinking that these were better, The intermediate doctor discharged me without even having the MRIs, talked to one of many assistants and ignored me and told me that I could not do anything, I won a future doctor because he refuses to accept The miserable $ 16,000 for my lower back of 15% dissable, the lawyer who comes to court knows nothing about your case and is well dismissed, Now a year later the case is still averse and I do not look at my future doctor anywhere, This lawyer is negotiating with the insurance, what can be done against these thieves? Note. When they are on the road they send your call to a machine and they never answer, If you are a new case and still do not steal the receptionist transfers your call to a person, If you have been robbed you will no longer answer.

(Original)
Deje a mi primer abogado pensando que estos eran mejores, El doctor intermedio me dio de alta sin siquiera tener los MRI, hable con uno de tantos asistentes y me ignoraba y me dijo que no podia hacer nada, Gane futuro medico porque me nege a aceptar los miserables $16,000 for my lower back of 15% dissable, el abogado que se presenta a corte no sabe nada de tu caso y es bien despota, Ahora un ano despues el caso sigue avierto y no miro mi futuro medico por ningun lado, Este abogado esta negociando con la aseguranza, Que se podra hacer contra estos ladrones? Nota. Cuando estos estan tranzando mandan tu llamada a un maquina y nunca responden, Si eres un caso nuevo y todabia no te roban la recepcionista transfiere tu llamada a una persona, Si te an robado ya no tendras rspuesta.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

< Review>
Love this place. They've upgraded their little patio dining area and it's super cute. Nothing better than sitting in the patio with a drink and some tasty Mexican food. The service is great as well. We ordered to go but it ended up being wrong. The manager put our name down for a replacement meal at a later date. Super nice.</Review>

<text>Clean, tasty, great Mexican food. Their recipes are just better than the rest and it's always fresh. You can just feel the goodness.

They have a full bar, EXTENSIVE tequila selection and a solid section of domestic as well as local and craft beers on tap.

Nice salsa selection as well, 2 reds and a tasty green are Mainstays.

Come relax and have fun.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMknNYBKOugdPULUbsRTrZxCEGNZ9tcItqQUQHA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaS8ZSdvWwVAiq_Z0wJXvszMG6BpJDLU1FfLVy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3GnAuCoL3l5Pcf_c2y_6BVpiHEorMcdAV4dgt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLnnMncOgn0kuqZgW2EOWdUy2vfnJrHccWC9IY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

I just ate here a couple hours ago with a buddy of mine after our hike. I had to say we worked up an appetite and we're looking for something delicious that would get us full for a good price. Mezcal Grill was definitely the place for that offering a super burrito that made me stuffed but at a reasonable price. The cashier was very friendly and even cracked some good jokes with my friend which made all us laugh. I recommend this place if you haven't tried it before or wish to get some quality food without breaking your wallet. I will be visiting this restaurant again ready for some more delicious food.< /Review>

Service SO RUDE so bad just not worth it- love Mex food but after the 5th wrong dinner order in a row 👎(not exag unfortunately) mezcal refused to fix, replace, refund or in any way make right...employees very rude to Polite roommate w accusations of lying about order for money when we only requested a remake/ correction dinner to eat after the 3rd time...Very unfortunate and not necessary when we are good customers & as former restaurant workers we tip absurdly high -and just want the food we paid for- but RUDENESS is the normal at this restaurant👎👎👎</Text>

<Review>This is the best Mexican food in Natomas, hands down. My street tacos were bomb, I can’t recommend the to go margaritas enough. Also they have a adorable outdoor patio.< /Review>< pics>

Even though this restaurant was only taking to go orders due to the virus it was a good experience. Super friendly staff delicious food clean environment.  They did take extra steps to keep environment clean such as spray and clean menus spray down counters and spray down the credit card machine where you use your finger to sign for the bill.  Did i mention how good the food was?  Lol<//text>

<review>Great food and friendly service. I haven't had a bad meal here yet, but I especially recommend the chile verde, pozole, and huevos rancheros (though the latter two dishes are on the breakfast menu only, and pozole is served only on weekends).<//review>< pics>

Food was great, excellent taste on the food. However, the employee taking the order and the other employee with green hair need to smile more and stop staring customers down. That was uncomfortable. Maybe focus more making customers feel more welcome.</Review>

What a great little place! They have the lightest, freshest Mexican food I've ever tasted! We are from Missouri so maybe it's just the Cali thing, but we were impressed. We left full and totally satisfied. I ordered the Mixed Seafood Ceviche Tostada (SO good!) and Mahi Mahi Taco (a la carte), my husband got the Enchiladas de Mole Plate, and his brother got the Mezcal 'Wet' Chicken Burrito. Everything was delicious! They also have a chip bar where you can help yourself to chips and 4 different salsas. Plus - friendly staff, good prices, and clean. Wish we had time to go back again!< /text>

Honestly I don't really ever leave bad reviews, but I have to share my experience with this place.  The servers are nice but the wait time was less than exceptional. Waited about 5+ minutes to be seated when there were a few open tables.  Ordered a beer and food and 30 minutes later still didn't have our food.  Other people waiting also looked a little frustrated.  Seemed as though the kitchen was backed up but it's a small place. Nice ambiance, poor execution. We won't go here again.<//Text>

<Text>I was very surprised that this place was so nice. There aren't very many places in Natomas to get good Mexican food, but this place was great. Their shrimp tacos were really good, as well as their burritos, and their bean dip. Service was excellent as well, and the owner of the restaurant is very involved in ensuring quality.< /Text>< pics>

So glad we took the drive from Elk Grove! This restaurant was absolutely delicious! The customer service was great. Out of our family of 6 we each enjoyed our meals. Love the vibe, cute restaurant. Thanks Lala for your great service. We will be back.</Review>

This is my go to place for fresh Mex. I am working my way through the menu. So far I super delighted. Fresh Mex made to order. Will prepare special plates for those with food allergies too. Excellent friendly service. Eddie you are the BEST! Excellent service and always with a smile!   😊  I love the salsa & chips bar.  DELISH!</review>

This is some of the best Mexican food my husband and I have ever had. Just prdered from Doordash and well pleased. I had the crispy ground beef tacos and mysband had the soft taco/burrito plate. Had bean and cheese dip and guacamole on the side and everything was fresh and wonderfully made. Highly recommend!</Review>

If I had been told I was gonna get charged with $5.94 extra. I wouldn't buy anything.. They are ok tacos but not $3.48 a piece.
I would rather drive all the way to citrus heights and stop at dos riós restaurant and get better tacos... Apart on several occasions when I asked for an al pastor burrito instead of meat they have put scrapes.
So I'm done with this place..<//review>

<time>1562377717009< /time><review>From out of town and we just wanted a good place to go with the family. Google did not let me down, and we had great food at a great price. Easy to see the signage from the road, and a lot of parking is available. Tables are available outside. You order and pay, and they give you a number for your table where they bring your order. The person that took our order made great recommendations, and the margaritas was so good and refreshing. We had the enchilada plate, fajita plate, quesadilla plate and California burger burrito, and all of it got 2 thumbs up all around.< /review><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None</Pics><Rate>5</Rate>< gmap_id>

If you want truly authentic Mexican cuisine that's perfectly prepared and beautifully presented, this is the restaurant for you. My husband had the cheese enchiladas and chilli rellenos; both came with the most amazing sauces. He could not stop raving about how delicious his dinner was. After sampling his meal, I totally agreed with him. I had the grilled shrimp salad. The shrimp was sumptuous and wonderfully seasoned. It was a light, yet satisfying meal, which is exactly what I wanted. Our waiter was wonderful - attentive and conscientious. This is now our favorite Mexican restaurant!</text>

My wife loves this place far more than I do - she'd undoubtedly give them 5 stars.  I like the food well enough.  I only order for takeout because of two major issues:

1) The chairs are very skinny and so very uncomfortable for a heavyset man like me

2) The one time I went the service was unbelievably slow and no comment was given by the waitstaff on the wait.

Otherwise it's great food, clean, and with friendly staff.  Highly recommended. :)< /Review>

Love this place. The food is good but it's really the staff that are truly stellar!

Went to dinner with my friend and her extremely finicky 4 year old granddaughter. They were happy to accommodate our requests for Scarlette and even came up with a suggestion that made the child's meal even more perfect for her.

I ordered the steak fajitas but what was delivered was chicken. They very graciously and quickly corrected the order. My meal was excellant as well as the margarita.

Thank you Mezcal for a lovely meal. I'll be back whenever I come out to visit my friend.</text>

The chef is so consistent.   I've  resorted to ordering the daily special as it is always solid.   Clean establishment,  well staffed,  kitchen is efficient and solid.  Great value as well.   Salsa bar is awesome.   This is the type of Mexican place that Davis needs so bad.    A sit down,  traditional Mexican restaurant.    We have plenty of taqurias  but it's just not the same experience.    Awesome place that has only gotten better in the 11 years I've been eating lunch here.</review>

Terrible service, bad attitude, blamed me (customer) for server screw up. I wrote a review on Square app and they sent a coupon/voucher to entice me back...when i presented the coupon/voucher the 'owner' said they won't take it at the location in natomas where the bad service/attitude occurred. Terrible attitude from 'owner' woman, bad service...boycott this bad bad place.<//text>

First time to this restaurant today and I would definitely go back again. I ordered the sopes meal with chicken as the meat. Everything was seasoned well but not laden with fats for flavor. I really enjoyed the freshness of my meal. The portions were great, I was not overly full nor under fed. My only con was the sope seamed just a tad over cooked but it was still delicious<//text>

sooo done here called in an order for 1 burrito just 1 was told it would take 20 mins to make the 1 so i post pone  my break for the miracle 20 min burrito only to get there to have to wait 20 more mins so now we are up to 40 mins for a burrito just 1  so at the 40 min mark im back in line to try to get a refund at this point when my food is FINALLY produced eating well into my break time
will never ever eat here again no matter how much time i have

i cant even comment on if the food is good or bad as im soo miffed that it took 40 mins to get my food
if you are in a hurry this is not the place to go
cant say if the food is good but at this point it i dont think it will be< /text>

<Text>I told the staff about my gluten free status. They checked in the menu items I selected and suggested another item instead... The carnitas.  The place was busy. Service was friendly and quick.  The food was fantastic.  It was fresh, full of flavor and plentiful. Highly recommended.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Delicious food! They served each of our plates as they were ready instead of bringing them all at once, which means we had fresh food. We had a very kind server who was also quite helpful when I couldn't figure out what I wanted. Had the Carne asada fries and they were delicious!<//Review>< Pics>

Fast service, great salsa. Dishes are full of flavor. Anything I pick off the menu has been delicious. I'm here 2-3 times a month for lunch.<//Review>

Shrimp and fish combo ceviche bowl is really good! Thought the saltines on the side were kinda weird. Doesn't fit the cuisine in my opinion. Would have like more tostada chips instead.</Text>

The mood of the place was perfect, if you want a ethnic experience you're getting it. They got comfy padded wall seating and the food was absolutely amazing.

This isn't your El foressto or Aldebertos or Carolinas burritos,  they're unique and the first bite into that Asada burrito reminded me of home cooking.  The taste of the beef reminded me instantly of family events and the fresh cows we'd chop up and cook.

Service was most excellent as well, very attentive and accommodating staff.</Text>

I love this place, it's super close to my work.  I always get their chicken enchiladas.  Good sized portions.  Clean restaurant.  Friendly staff.  Yummy salsa bar.  The surrounding location is a little meh, but overall a nice place for foods< /text>

The food is flavorful, seasoned, beautifully presented, and consistent. The servers are excellent and recognize my family and me, and entertain my young daughter briefly. They even have kids meal options. The Camarones a la Diabla are so spicy, I just love the endorphin rush I get from it. Mezcal really rocks it with the flavors and good portion size. I highly recommend this outstanding restaurant!</Review>

I had the sopes plate with the side of beans and rice. The food was great and was a great value. The server was friendly and the restaurant clean. They also have a large salsa bar that is clearly labeled with a large variety and spice levels from mild to hot.< /review>

<Review>This place is unbelievable. The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is seasoned to perfection, portions are huge and the price makes me feel like it's 1980 again. I could eat here every day. The new location is immaculate - seriously, I would eat off the floor it's so clean. The Molcajetes are the best thing I've ever eaten. Just go. Don't think about it. Go now.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Been coming in since they opened many years ago. The food has always been great.
SERIOUSLY have tried atleast 75% menu and everything has been on point and tasty. You can even make some of your own requests too.i really like there mole sauce and have gotten it put in a quesadilla and got a burrito wet style with it, covered that burrito with it. So good. The shrimp salad is amazing too. Loaded with grilled marinated shrimp and has a mango vinaigrette.
Ayce nacho bar comes with your orders.
They also have kids options too.
Plenty of parking and service is great!< /Review>

<text>First time here, 3 star experience; it was lunch time, the order line is slow/long since there's only one cashier; my plate was made last of 5 orders at the same table, each item was brought out 1 by 1 on its own, ~10m from start to finish of all our orders reaching the table. the soda fountain was dripping syrup, plate was made with the wrong sauce, napkins were out of stock (none on the tables, only oneplace to get them)... chips and salsa were good, so I'll give it another shot.</text>< gmap_id>

Really friendly staff and pretty good food, especially for the neighborhood. Their seafood is particularly good, but other menu items are also above average. Prices are above a cheap taqueria but still very affordable.<//Review>

With my love of  Mexican food, I was excited to find a little gem in the neighborhood of Natomas. Great  burritos, chimichangas,  tostadas, tacos...amazing dishes that always makes it hard to decide what to order. I remember my first thought when I had my first meal, I knew I had to bring everyone here. Everyone that I've brought here has  loved it.

Everything made here is exquisite and their service is excellent.<//review><Gmap_id>0x809ad6fb3b363d77:0x2dce3e55a9fb3f62<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

This is my first time coming here. And I probably won't come here too much often because of the fact that I live in Oakland and not Sacramento. If I lived in Sacramento though I would definitely make this is my first time coming here and I probably won't come here too much often because of a fact that I live in Oakland and not Sacramento if I lived in Sacramento though I would definitely make this a favorite taco and burrito place to come to the food was hot and delicious the staff was extremely friendly especially our server.<//Review>

Food was good. Free chips were a bit thick and hard though. But they were, after all, free. Taquitos only come in chicken, so that sucked. Would be willing to try again. Major fly problem outside though< /review>

I just love their wet burrito. The difference on the sauces is perfect, but to make it a true special you have to order this with shrimp.</review>

Mezcal grill is definitely a little more catered to "American" tastes than other options nearby, but mostly in terms of the decor. Their menu has a lot of classic Mexican dishes, including mole, regular and "street" style tacos, and a whole bunch of other stuff that looks great. I usually stick to the burritos though, both because I'm poor and the main plates are a little pricey, and the burritos have never disappointed. They never go too heavy on the seasonings, if anything it tastes lighter than most other burritos, if that makes sense, the flavors are well balanced, and I've never had a messy burrito (no one wants a messy burrito).  They have a good variety of salsas, but I've never gone for any other than the standard pico de gallo and green stuff (I gotta figure out what it's called) because they're outstanding on chips and as a garnish on whatever you're eating.  This place is my go-to for all of the above reasons.< /Review>

I decided to do a review today which I will also do one on Yelp as well. The last 3 times I came here my order was wrong which is upsetting. I decided to call in and order today when I did the service was very rude he sat the phone down and didn't say anythjng. I decided to just come on in and order. As I arrived Fabien which was on the phone and took the order over the phone which was never placed. He was so rude and once I placed my order he went to the back and spoke in Spanish and everyone looked out the window at me which made me very uncomfortable and also questions if I even wanted the food after that. My normal expirence is ok I come all the time but I won't be back the food is ok but not all that for me to pay 40$ 50$ Everytime I come to be treated so poorly and rude if your African American be aware they will not treat you equally as they treat another race Fabien needs to be fired he has a bad attitude poor customer service he was eating the entire time speaking in Spanish and had bad attitude I think he's in the LGBT community and for that he should be more humble considering judgement ECT Fabien your service was poor and your attitude was extremely rude.</review>

<text>This is the spot! Quick and friendly service, the perfect amount of caliente (just a touch) to their dishes, very flavorful! Their guac could use a lil' more avocado, especially since they charge like $2 for a tablespoon amount. Chips could also be better. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that they use peanuts in the mole and they don't mark it on the menu. Also, they don't all seem aware that the mole contains peanuts (one person said yes, another said no). This is a bit frustrating since peanuts are the #1 food allergy in the U.S. and the deadliest food allergy.< /text>< user_id>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Came here for a birthday dinner. It's somewhere in between one of those casual Mexican restaurants where you order at the counter and get to enjoy all the delights of the salsa and chips bar, and a full blown fancy restaurant where your every whim is catered to. This place has a bit of an upper crust look, and it tries to travel in the same direction with it's fancy menu as well. This was perfect for a birthday celebration feel. I tried the Chile relleno plate, my husband got something with shrimp, and my mother in law got the nachos. The nachos were loaded, no doubt. I didn't try the shrimp plate but my husband said it was good. The Chile relleno was as I expected -- the truth is I have to realize I'm just not much for the blandness of the Chile relleno plate where bite after bite is the same. It's not that I don't like chili. I do. I love spicy peppers. It's just... Like I said, you take one bite, you have taken them now. Now let me say though that it was coated in a delicious red sauce. However.... It was fully coated. So it left no difference for comparisons. The waiter who assisted us was very nice and pleasant and attentive to refilling our drinks. We brought our little one with us also and the restaurant was very accommodating. Overall a pleasant experience, but perhaps should have tried a super burrito or their tacos instead.<//Review>< Pics>

Excellent food. I work close to this restaurant, so coming here often is easy for me. It has a lot of good food, and I've spent time ordering a lot of different things on the (continuously improving) menu to get a really good idea of the food variety they have to offer here.

They have great meats here, my favorite probably being the chile verde. I love that you can get it in a burrito! That's a standard order of mine. Lately I've been branching out and getting crispy tacos with al pastor, carnitas, carne asada, etc. They're all great. They have outstanding shrimp tacos as well, that have a bit of spice mixed in. A wonderful tomato-based sauce goes with 3-4 large shrimp in each taco.

The salsa bar is pretty good, and while I like spicy foods, the flavor of the mild salsas here are better, for me, than the spicy varieties.

The rice and beans you get with meal plates are standard. They're not amazingly special by any means, but they give you what you're looking for when you get rice and beans: carb-y bites of nicely-done rice with creamy refried beans, and a touch of cotija on top. Standard, and good.

Yes, I'd recommend this place.<//Review>

<Text>You know it's a great taqueria with great food when everyone inside is Latino cheering on the soccer game.

When the food came, I knew I was spot on. I ordered the super nachos with carne asada and taco salad with carnitas. The portions were more than enough even if you come in starving and they are generous with the meats. They use romaine lettuce rather than iceberg like most other taquerias so that was a plus. They also have a chips and salsa bar that you can help yourself to. The avocado salsa was simply amazing! I repeat, amazing! Much thicker and creamier than I've had elsewhere and even had chucks of real avocado still in there.

If I didn't live so far from this place, I would be a regular.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Great customer service the quality of the meat is terrible because it' has chewy pieces of hard fat in their Carne Asada. You'll have to take that part out when eating.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Good service I liked the right one of the waiter and I recommend the broth of 7 seas I felt the rich flavor that should be served in a broth and the whole seafood unlike other places previously visited the seafood has touched me almost or half I almost recommend seafood mashed.

(Original)
Buen servicio me gustó la correcta del mesero y recomiendo el caldo de 7 mares le eh sentido el sabor rico q se debe optener en un caldo y los mariscos enteros ah diferencia de otros lugares antes visitados los mariscos me an tocado casi o bien la mitad o casi puré de mariscos lo recomiendo .<//text>
