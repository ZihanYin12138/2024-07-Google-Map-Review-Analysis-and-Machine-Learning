1st time at this place. Visited while we were on vacation in Palm Desert. I was surprised at the amazingly fresh fare. It tasted like we were seaside instead of being in the middle of a desert. Great tasting sushi. One bit of criticism, I ordered the Hatari Pork bun and was very dry despite the generous amount of sauce. But all in all a surprise considering it was in a tourist trap location.  It outperformed its surroundings.<//Text>

<Review>I never leave reviews but in this case I feel lead to let people know that this was one of the worst places I have been to. Immediately after eating here I threw it up. After that I saw the kitchen was a mess. Then noticed  the rest of my fish was discolored. I do not recommend.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Unbelievably good sushi. Sashimi was fresh as the rolls were big, and not because they padded then with rice.

We got takeout in the middle of the pandemic restrictions and the food was ready in less than 30 minutes and the staff on the phone and in person could not have been kinder.

I highly recommend Happy Sushi, you will not be disappointed.<//text>

The staff there were very helpful and friendly. They could use more hands there. Basically one guy serving all the tables. Obviously there was a bit of a wait for anything.  Roll pricing seems good when you look at the menu, but the rolls are relatively small.. There are a few good buys here, but you really need to try several items to find it.</Text>

Great value, very tasty and all the classic sushi items available. It was busy so the order took about 45 mins, so ordering ahead is wise!</Review>

Good food for a reasonable price. They have gluten free soy sauce too.  The chicken teriyaki is a bit bland even with the sauce but there is a very generous portion of chicken for $8.</Text>

You know why I come to Happy Sushi? Chef Jake’s hospitality, it’s primo location, never a wait, the prices are the best in town- seriously. You may come in for the $4 sushi tempura roll but it’s the special firecracker roll that keep you coming back. Luckily for me- it seems to be going unnoticed so we can always find a quick lunch and seats for an unplanned dinner date. We were sitting on the patio with a roll from Chef Jake and we watched as several people walking by, catching a glimpse of our table, actually had to stop in themselves.<//Review>

<text>We were looking for a different sushi restaurant but it ended up being closed when we were hungry. So we migrated to Happy Sushi 🍣. The service was fabulous and the food was great!

< Review>
Super small portions, especially for the high price.  they pack thier togo ramen in the same container instead of separating the noodles and the broth like literally every other ramen shop in the world. Tasted okay but nothing really noteworthy. Will not be returning. Of you're looking for better ramen check out Sapporo, it's a bit father but worth the drive and they have cheap beers.<//Review>

Very solid sushi. Nothing was particularly out of this world but our lunch was definitely enjoyable. Hubby and I both enjoyed miso soup and spicy albacore tartare. I also had two spicy tuna hand rolls while my husband had a spicy dynamite roll (very spicy sauce) and eel avocado roll. We’ll be back to this convenient location.<//Review>

this was an excellent restaurant. My friend introduced me to the restaurant and I was very pleased with the excellent Sushi tempura teriyaki chicken and everything that was included in the combo meal. I wasn't aware that there were a couple of excellent restaurants like these in Cathedral City specializing in Japanese Cuisine. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.<//text>

Pretty average for the price. There’s no atmosphere you feel like you’re in a food court and the portion size small. The young man that served us was lovely however the food and atmosphere for the price just wasn’t there.< /text>

The first time I went I was skeptical but I love this place! I always recommend this place for sushi and ramen! The staff is very nice and friendly. They don't bother you too much but it's really easy to get their attention if anything. Everything is flavorful and well made.</text>

I used to love this place,  went last night. Looks like new owners. New chef.  Got my soup, then my main course came before appetizer. So waiting for it sushi sat there.
Service was slow hot saki was not really hot.  Sushi was not even completely wrapped in seaweed didn't know there was a shortage on seaweed.
Will not be going back !!!
Also had called several times to see if they still had happy hour specials the phone number listed on Google doesn't work.<//Review>

Great sushi and great prices. Doesn’t look much from the outside and wasn’t sure if it would be good, but exactly what I was looking for  - casual vibe inside, good quality sushi at really great prices. Had the salmon/avocado roll, and various pieces of sushi - all was very tasty<//Text>

I should listened to the red flags. Every place next to it were packed with customers except here. There were only 4 people inside. Yelp reviewers gave them a low rating as well but i was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The food by taste was acceptable if you’re really hungry and felt like you just needed something really quick. However the photos vs the real food brought out weren’t even in the same ball park. Half the rolls were falling apart because they weren’t tight enough. The seared dish on a bed of salad was so sad. The salad looked like it straight out the spring mix package from costco. Some leaves were even overly wilted that it tasted bitter or like dirt. I could’ve made that myself, certainly wasn’t worth the price.

The 2 stars are mainly for effort, they seemed like they really tried hard but for what you pay and what you get in terms of quality, presentation, and overall cost, i would recommend going elsewhere.<//text>

Nothing really wrong with the quality, but I'm used to sushi from Seattle so it didn't live up to what I'm used to. It's also a fair bit overpriced in my opinion.</review>

<Review>It was a late night call. The shop has the ambiance of a white castle. BUT the sushi was excellent. The staff was very courteous and fast. We had a good variety of rolls, unagi and many others. We were a party of nine. Beer and wine only. Rightvon palm canyon drive. Lively spot. Eat here!<//Review>< Pictures>

We went there based on reviews that have been posted it and were very disappointed. The quality of the sushi, the roles and overall experience or underwhelming. The prices were inexpensive and in this case you got what you paid for.  There are many other choices available in Palm Springs and the surrounding area‘s. Maybe they were off on their game last night so I will give it another try in a few weeks.</text>

First time customers here, and we loved the food. We are vegetarians and ordered vegetable ramen, California roll, cucumber roll, and agedashi tofu. We skipped dessert. We were totally full and satisfied. If you crave healthy, hot or spicy ramen, this is the place. We went on Monday evening, so parking was easy. Highly recommend this place.<//Text>

<Review>I had a craving for Ramen and I went for the Ramen. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, and must say, I have had way better instant Ramen, Nissin makes a better noodle and broth than this place. The veggies were either from frozen packs or canned, the broth had an overpowering ginger flavor. The spiciness in the spicy miso must have originated from a bottle of shriracha or a similar chili garlic sauce because it added a sweet flavor. The Nori was the slick texture or instant miso soup. Which explains allot of my gripe about the ramen. The noodles we're too soft no spring to them and very short, I couldn't perform the customary slurping as the noodle had no length to reach the edge of the liquids surface as dangling from my mouth. My biggest issue the egg, it was hardboiled, and the yolk was over done so it became powdery and polluted the soup base. In addition I ordered a Salmon skin salad, it wasn't good either, and it came after I finished my Ramen. Salad regardless of type should be served as a starter, and if that's not the case at your establishment inform the customer. I will never be going here again.<//Review>< Date>

<Review>How in the hell did this place get a 4.1 !?!? Lol !!! Sat at the sushi bar ALONE for 15 min. before someone ask if I've been served, sushi chefs did not know what Uni or Saba was, and 60% who walked in after me walk out because they were tired of standing there. LoL !!!<//Review>< name>

<resp>None</resp><review>This place should be called Saddest Sushi. I read a ton of these reviews here and I’m wondering if people actually know what sushi needs to look and taste like. Obviously, you’re not getting Japan quality here in SoCal. But the Saddest Sushi has no clue what it should be. The rice wasn’t sticky, was your traditional kitchen white rice, fluffy. The sushi pieces were served totally deformed as if they had been through the floor. The Salmon Skin sushi instead of being crunchy it was soggy and chewy.  Me and my friends usually order sushi in batches as we share for the whole table. After the first batch of different types, that we left several pieces, we just got the check and left. Still hungry and looking for another replace.

Well organized, COVID aware, and a welcoming environment. They won't always have the game you're looking for, but they'll usually be able to place an order for you or have a game delivered to your door.< /review>

Also, I had the Game Stop membership, so I was suppose to get dibs on pre-ordering PS5. They never gave me opportunity to do so.<//review>< Response>

Kyle is the MAN!!!! My go to gamestop for store exclusive. I have a gamestop close to my area, but avoid going there. Lets just say, I didn't have a good experience with some of the employees that worked there when I tried to call to check on a product. Again, very helpful staff on this store...<//text>

Called ahead to put a game on hold and was told the game was held for me until 9pm. Yet, when I drove out the workers had no idea who took the message or where the game was, so I had drove out of my way to get a game that the workers seemed to just have “misplaced.” All the workers seemed immature and unprofessional, not offering to even help look for another place with the game instead opting to just say “sorry ‘bout that.”</text>

Used to like this GameStop, but the cashier lied to my wife, telling her that she could bring back a used Xbox One within 30 days, if she didn't like it. She tried to return it and was told that their policy is 7 days for used systems. She had asked him several times and he confirmed that she could and now she's stuck with a $200+system that she doesn't need or want. Bad business. Definitely won't recommend people shop there.</text>

<Text>Employee automatically put a warranty on the purchase of a game. He told me the total and said "and that includes a warranty" I told him I don't know why it was put on and had him take it off. Be aware of the attempts to get you to pay more than the price listed on the product.<//Text>< Name>

My kids love it here they always demand a new game every so often and try my best to give my kids the most that i can. However i want to point out that they are not cheap at all and that the location is super jam packed and its a bit hard to get around.< /review>

<Text>I am increasingly dissatisfied with my gamestop's experience and it has nothing to do with the staff. Largely the amount they pay for used games is incredibly low and the amount they charge to purchase for a used game is too high. I wish it was different but I don't see a reason to choose gamestop over anywhere else that sells games< /Text>< Response>

<text>I love this gamestop compared to others I have been to nearby. They are always super helpful and I go there all the time. It isn't as huge as other gamestops but its worth going to check out cuz their selections of used games is huge. I find a lot of good deals there on used games. The staff actually knows their games. They even seem to know exactly the kind of games  I like but I guess cuz I shop there so much. They are the best and I recommend this location. :)< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

as long as now everything goes with online shopping . I don’t hv good experience with order I had last day I pay almost 60$ for only one medium pizza and 2 plate fries ….when I call them for fix it. They explain for me this was the cost and tip plus tax and delivery….. I chooses special item at site and I never get that price . It was 2 medium 18$… but they don’t accept that so I pay 60$ for a pizza . I never recommend this store online website.< /text>

<text>Good Pizza Hut, hard working people, friendly customer service. Davit was great helping me. Walked in hungry late night he took the Oder made the food and charged me with a big smile he seemed tiered but never complained and took care of couple of more orders and customers while my order was in the oven. Great work Davit, wishing you a bright future as bright as your smile, finishing school and keeping great work ethic that you have! Food was super tasty and Hut!</text><gmap_id>0x80c2c0104db6381f:0x9358b69de997e81a< /gmap_id><user>104195080820764518056</user><name>Armen Parsighian<//name><date>1519623513586< /date>< rating>

This Pizza Hut is far better than the one on Brand. The pizza comes out hot and delicious. They also have car-side pickup if you don't feel like going in or aren't comfortable going in.</Text>

<text>I order a lot of pizza, and Pizza Hut is always quick & tasty. Staff are friendly & efficient, and my only complaint is frequent price increases over the past few of years (which I know is out of the control of individual locations/employees). I'd like to see more veggie topping options and a bigger push for meat alternatives & vegan cheese - I loved the Beyond Sausage campaign, I wish they'd bring it back!</text>< username>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>You know, the journey of life can be strange sometimes. Yes a unique way to begin a review about pizza. In a mood to share. So often when thinking of driving along Glenoaks Boulevard, I find that my mind will often transport me to another plane of existence. Suddenly all around me, tones and colors. Sepia here. Copper there. Burnt umber beyond. Yes rare is the occasion where the words burnt umber are utilized in a review. About pizza. But thinking of tooling along Glenoaks Blvd., I become engulfed into a 1976 copper-colored Pontiac Trans Am. And next to me in the car is my bearded and somewhat humorous friend Angel. He had run afoul of things in the past. But the copper Trans Am brings us to a better place. As the theme to the 1970s TV show "The Rockford Files" blades in the background. Namely the draw of this quite tasty Pizza Hut draws us in. Nothing never-do-well. Just good pizza. And roughly a gallon of Coca-Cola. Bottom line: this Pizza Hut. It's good. It's groovy!<//Review>< pics>

Stop putting the ketchup packets in with the fries. The containers are filled with hot fries that steam up the inside of the container, causing the ketchup packets to fill up with hot air to the point of almost bursting and be very hot, neither of which ketchup should be.</text>

We spent a delightful time there with fine meal and an efficient crew and a distinguished chief cook. We  added this place in our phone list  and we will no doubt return very soon.

The only bummer is that it's an extra $1.50 for a soy wrap. For an already expensive restaurant, this charge seems over the top.. The pepperfin is really good also. The sauce that it comes in is so tasty, it's almost drinkable.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Everytime I find myself at their website ready to place an order, they manage to find me why I take my business elsewhere. Service charge, delivery fee, and dumb rewards redeeming policies make PH an even lower choice in my fast food pizza list.</review>

<text>Worst customer service ever!
I ordered a large pizza online which was $7.99 with two toppings. So I decided to choose my toppings. At the end I noticed the price stayed the same $7.99 and I add delivery for the order. But the minimum order was about $9 ,so I also add one side, french fries with it. So the total price was $17.18 at the end with delivery charge.But, they delivered a small mini pizza with french fries. I called them that this is not my order. They said this is a price for a small one, not the large one. The manager said your total price will be $32 for this order. I had my order in front of me on computer and total price $17.18, but she didn't accept. She said if you want you have to pay the rest. she knew what was my order after I called them, but they even didn't call me for changing my order. They just changed my pizza to mini size and send it to me. I was very mad and asked them to refund my money.Their website is very poor. Don't trust the price in the website. I will not order again from this store.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Normal Pizza hut quality pizza, I'll let you make your opinion on that. However this location has basically no where to park for pickup orders and the staff is not ever that friendly.
When I get delivery from this location it's fast easy and the delivery person is nice, but carryout always seems to be a hassle that's more than it's worth.</review>

<Review>Hard to say I'd go back. Initial phone call started of dry, robotic and at a point irritated. The questions I ask seemed to irritated the host. I wasn't trying to be THAT customer but. I don't see the problem when a customer is only trying to see what's available. It is a customer driven system....I am 100% sure the employee who was standing by the register was the person who helped me on the phone. I did get greated on a good note and asked if I had ordered already. I answered with a " yes, thank you I just got of the phone with some one" her response was "ok and walked away". I believe a simple, ok I'll see if your order has been started, would have changed my mentality.  Let's hope the food taste better then the experience.< /Review>< Rating>

I ordered there many times because we live down the street.  First they have messed up on our orders to many times to count, once I complained, they said they'd note it on the system and give a free pizza next time we order, and that was a total lie, acted like we were a bunch of free loaders when we tried to get them to follow through on what they said.  The last straw for me was today when I called, and I was finalizing my order, the lady just stopped talking, didn't say shes putting us on hold nothing, and I could tell she was holding her hand over the phone, and I heard her in the background saying she's going to hang up on these **** or something insulting.  This place is shockingly bad, but there is billions of people in the area so they'll always stay in business and just keep disappointing their never ending supply of customers.< /Text>

They really helped me. Starting with the initial call (during pandemic). I never had to step into their office. The office staff were very reassuring. They really came through for me. Not all cases are alike, but they promised that they would do everything in their power to get me positive results and they delivered.<//text>

< Review>
my first speeding ticket i was going 90 in a 70 zone on memorial day weekend in Fresno going down the 5 freeway south. i paid ticket clinic the same amount as the ticket because they asked for it. $380 or so. the Attorney Amanda Seymour didn't win my case and now i owe the Fresno city ticket price of $380. thank you ticket clinic! will NEVER GO THROUGH YOU AGAIN AND YOU SHOULDN'T AS WELL. your just gonna double your cost that you owe< /Review>

After being targeted by police for driving a high profile vehicle with a loud color and receiving 4 tickets in 2 months. I decided to give this office a try and was not disappointed, they are extremely helpful, and took care of me and my cases from beginning to end, I was a skeptic but they made me realize it is possible to get justice and maintain the integrity of your driving record. Keep your driving record clean and stop paying the fines, give ticket clinic a try! Thanks again for your professionalism and success in getting my tickets dismissed!!< /Text>

For the first time in  trying something new the ticket  clinic has been really a positive experience helped me dismiss a traffic ticket I received that would have probably ended up as points on my driving record but thanks to them! I was able to continue to enjoy life without any hassle and be able to keep no points from going on my history I owe them alot thank you so much! You really do make good outcomes and a big money saver too best prices!!!!! Can't beat it straight forward and tell you how it is worry free.< /Review>

<Text>I was skeptical at first using the ticket clinic to fight my ticket. I thought since the charge for their service was so low they wouldn't care much about my case. That wasn't true at all. They let me know the progress each step of the way. They were professional and all my questions were answered in a timely manner. I will recommend them to anyone who has a traffic case.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I just got a speeding ticket it was going to cost over $400.00 the ticket Clinic does not guarantee anything si I was worried but I took the leap and it worked. I didn't have to go to court or do anything. the speeding ticket was dismissed and no points as if it never happend. since then I have used them 2 more times with the same results. Thank you Ticket Clinic for simply saving me money and time.< /Review>< pics>

The Ticket Clinic has an ALL STAR team., They are very professional and patient with their clients., I respect that  they were very honest and straight forward from the gate., The Attorney answered all my questions that I was concerned about., The Ticket Clinic went to a battle for me and came out successful.</text>

< Review>
I can’t thank Ticket clinic enough for getting my speeding ticket dismissed. I’m definitely not a bad driver and I guess I just got unlucky one day and I’m so glad I was relieved of it. I definitely recommend ticket clinic to anyone who is trying to fight an undeserved ticket or any ticket for that matter. Thank you ticket clinic<//Review>

No hassle. I literally had to do nothing to get ticket dismissed. Got a letter saying "dismissed". Very pleased and will use Ticket Clinic again if I have problems.

Thanks</Review>

First of all I want u all to know that if your a commercial driver always fight your ticket no matter what... I got a ticket on the 170 north for driving on the second lane.  A couple of months after I got a speeding ticket on the 5 south coming from kettleman city.. first ticket happen in Los angeles and the second one happend in Kern county.. both tickets were dismissed no points on my record . Couldn't be happier.</Review>

<review>I had 4 tickets. 2 speeding tickets, one for 600 and one for 300 plus a busted tail light and fail to change address ticket. All BS. my tickets were over 1000$. I paid 300$ total to fight all these tickets at ticket clinic and they got them ALL dismissed and no points and I didnt have to stress about anything or go to the dmv or court. Would definitely use again.<//review>< Time>

<Review>I got a bogus late registration ticket in 2017. I hired them to take care of it. I paid 410 for a FTA and now I'm paying over $800 myself at the courthouse because it wasnt taken care of and I wasnt informed and my license was suspended and I got sent to collections. You can imagine how happy I am right now. Simply awful. Use a different company to fight your tickets.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c1a9ba961cf5:0x1bc4b4782bfe2e0</GmapID></record>

I called and gave them all the info for a speeding ticket I got (somehow while being parked...). I couldn't afford to miss work to go fight it myself. No more action needed on my part. Ticket was dismissed. Couldn't be happier with the service!</text>

I called for the 3rd time to follow up on my ticket status after being told I would receive an email within 2 weeks after my 1st call.  The representative who answered my call was very unprofessional and rude, I did not appreciate the service I received.  If the representatives that answer the calls are unprofessional I can't imagine how the attorneys are with the clients.< /text>

<review>Two different playground areas for smaller and bigger kids. My son really enjoyed both and especially the sand play area. The playgrounds are quite far apart so would be a challenge if you have two kids of different ages. Public restrooms available. Was very hot on our visit with very little shade.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2WAADJ4vM36S3kNrn9u7QvVpZ-nkUn_-suYvr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3B1pCKd_zmLX748fJKiZKf4Rj7Vjka58d1JyO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW0DE7UfImKYFxybt5UM-OY2c5LPsh8dvUCFwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv-vgaP2ic7jLDIJSCCQrjafAYWd_gCjatl34y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMZWkuPQTg39CkloDc7Re_3n4GsTQSgv5JIPXF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONd2zO5HXK7zNOXjKEEVDlPi8Ohajig32X4kMC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

A large park, with two great kids play areas with lots of fun equipment (especially for middle aged kids). There are paved paths to walk or skate. There are four large baseball fields with impeccably manicured grass and great seats.

There is lots of parking spots all around the park.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>We love Wilson park becuase there's 2 playgrounds. The smaller kids have an enclosed play area with sand. The older kids have a larger structure. Kids can bike around on the walkway and use the grass field to kick balls, play badminton or sun bathe. There's also baseball diamonds that the little league uses for their practice and games. In addition to the bathrooms which as accessbile, there's a ceramic art studio which has been closed during the pandemic. Lastly for dog lovers, Cupertino parks provides bags for everyone to pick up after their pets.</review>< pics>

<review>currently my favorite park in Cupertino since Creekside Park is full of soccer players (adults who smoke even though all Cupertino parks are supposed to be non-smoking), bicyclists (adults who think it's a velodrome even though they're violating vehicle laws by riding in the park on the side walk), teenagers and kids littering ... basically a lot of rude people at Creekside< /review>< pictures>

Really nice park with several baseball fields and playground. Easily accessible from local schools like Cupertino High, Sedgewick, and Lawson, and has nice picnic shelters and tables to hold events and picnics.</review>

<Date>1514339997741<//Date><Text>It's a fine park. Lots of grass and foliage as expected. Sometimes you may spot the rare group of teenagers memeing around and playing the piano badly.

Edit: Sometimes you may also see a masked elmo with hazardous candles lit around it as if summoning satan. Highly likely the same memeing teenagers. Probable cause of the next California fire you heard it here first.</Text><response>None< /response><Name>Elaine Wang<//Name></record>

(Translated by Google) One of my favorite places. Just standing there will make you feel refreshed. There aren't many shades to let kids play, but it's still a place I love so much that I want to come here again and again.
There is a fence in the area where small children play, so children can play safely.

(Original)
大好きな場所の一つ。そこに立つだけで心が洗われるような気持ちになります。子供を遊ばせるには日影が少ないけれど、それでも私はここに何度でも来たいと思うほどに大好きな場所です。
小さな子どもが遊ぶエリアには柵がしてあるので、子どもたちを安全に遊ばせることができます。< /Review>

This is our first time coming here,  and all I can say is that their menudo, taquitos de papa, and handmade tortillas are delicious. The place is small, but you can order out and their salsas are homemade and spicy, which I loved!</review>

Complementary chips and very good salsa with a good spice to it. I ordered the chicken burrito, pretty good size for a big guy pretty good flavor to it. Great prices, very affordable.  Wait time for my burrito was about 10 min.<//Text>

It's good and the price is right. It'd be nice if they could get with the times and not be cash only.<//text>

I have been coming to this restaurant for years and I cannot stress enough that this place deserves a 5 star. This place has authentic Mexican food.
The customer service is great and the environment is friendly. They got everything from Nachos, menudo, breakfast plates, Tortas, and throughout the week they have Special plates written on their chalkboard(pretty amazing)!</text>

<review>I work at an upscale Mexican Restaurant. What we serve is top quality ingredients for a gourmet Mexican experience... What I'm going with this is that I am spoiled on my taste for Mexican food ,and this Michoacano place has the Costillas de Puerco en salsa roja that is soooooo good. Their beans with home made tortillas are just spectacular. Complementary chips and very good salsa with a good spice to it. I ordered the chicken burrito, pretty good size for a big guy pretty good flavor to it. Great prices, very affordable.  Wait time for my burrito was about 10 min.  Treat yourself!< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcd851de3f5d51:0x37c54fa60d32f82b</gmap_id>< Response>

I work at an upscale Mexican Restaurant.
What we serve is top quality ingredients for a gourmet Mexican experience...
What I'm going with this is that I am spoiled on my taste for Mexican food ,and this Michoacano place has the Costillas de Puerco en salsa roja that is soooooo good.
Their beans with home made tortillas are just spectacular.  Treat yourself!<//review>

Good is good. Except when there is a short lady with curly hair. She is slow, dirty and rude. There is another lady that is fast clean and friendly. That's when I go.<//text>

(Translated by Google) A corn place, a restaurant step, but with a formidable food, apart that is noticeable in the taste that they use fresh and well hygienic products, I mean clean.
You can tell that the cook ladies love their work, because the food is very rich ... and at good prices
I recommend it .. 100/100 ..

Un lugar cencillo, un restaurante de paso , pero con una formidable comida, aparte que se nota en el sabor que utilizan productos frescos y bien higienisados, osea limpios.

(Translated by Google) The food is excellent but the servers do not know how to give service, they leave you waiting a long time, they do not offer you the menu and they do not give you chips. The good thing is the cooks cycle very rich, but waiters are useless.

(Translated by Google) Nothing to say about the food because it is very tasty, the only bad thing is that when you talk on the phone they make you wait a long time to take your order that is not good hopefully they improve it

(Original)
Nada que decir de la comida porque esta muy rica ,lo único malo es que cuando hablas por teléfono te hacen esperar mucho tiempo para tomar tu orden eso no está bien ojalá y lo mejoren<//Review>

Well, the place is essentially empty and so, getting through security to your gate is pretty darn easy. Just arrive 2 hours early.<//review>

I have to start here if there is anyone that has found a Cannon Camera in a red and green case please turn the camera in or better yet just turn in the memory card I  have a lot of precious memories on that card, I was just there in terminal 5 with TSA which removed the camera from the bag why when it wasn't even required for me  to take it out. Please again if anyone is reading this please direct me to the proper person to handle this, I want my memories that's all 😭😭UPDATE : My Camera and my memory card has been found and is in  my possession.< /Text>

Terminal 5 Delta airlines is a decent terminal with Free Wi-Fi provided by Boingo. Download speed 10 Mbps, upload 10 mbps tested on a Departure level near gate 51. I love LA store and Coffee Bean nearby.<//Text>

<text>It’s a very crowded terminal with very little space to move about in the boarding area. Seating is limited AND you have to crab walk through the isle if you hope to sit down. The chairs are very beat up and old. The carpeted floors are dirty.

Lots of food and shop options.

Currency exchange and ATM machines are conveniently located.

The loud speakers plays advertisements frequently. So annoying.

WiFi is free but very limited. Plus, you will have to watch sponsors advertisements if you hope to get free WiFi. Charging plugs are also limited for laptops and cellphones.

Cellular service must be blocked. I can only get one bar in this terminal. I came in from New Zealand. After 11 hours of travel, it would be nice to have a little space to relax during the connecting flight.</text>< Pics>

Pretty nice and clean airport but there is no McDonald's or any fast food restaurant so there are pretty limited food stands and the prices there are super expensive.  Plus for Uber/Lyft, there is a designated spot for rideshare aapps to come pick up spot which is pretty helpful.<//Text>

Often difficult to navigate, Terminal 5, as all terminals in LAX, can be a bit of a trick. But Hawaiian Airlines and American airlines that fly out of this terminal are good services and there are a lot of amenities to tide your time as you wait. See's candy, I love LA, and Skewers by Muramoto are within the terminal. If these don't satisfy, and you have a lot of time on your hands, in the next terminal by walkway are Dunkin Donuts, Umami Burger LAX, and Rock & Brews. There are power stations setup through the terminal so you can charge your device. But they get filled quickly, so when you see a spot open take it. And this way you can enjoy working on your tablet or listening to music or watching a video while you wait, and you can still be charged up and ready to go when you board your plane. Enjoy your trip.<//Text>

<Review>All I can say is wow. Beautiful job.  My dog was going to a vet that had to sedate him to get groomed.   Would go in the back and see "bite" on a sign.  April and her partner did a wonderful job and my dog warmed up to them.  He was nervous at first but no medication.   This is what happens when people have positive energy.  They were on time and professional.   Thank-you.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_name>

<rate>5</rate><review>April’s mobile grooming takes wonderful care of our girl, Penny. The groomers are kind, responsive, not afraid to ask questions or give suggestions and always loving to Penny. April is responsive and is always able to schedule appointments around our schedule. Pricing is reasonable for services provided and removal of any anxiety around dropping off your dog to a grooming facility, cage drying, etc. Knowing your pup is just steps away and not being left in a cage lessens the anxiety for both human and pet. Highly recommend! ❤️🐶< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Our sweet and fluffy cat, Leo, suffers with long fur during the hot months, and needs bathing and shaving on his underside. We called April, who scheduled Leo for the next day with Arturo, who is a gem and loves animals! 45 minutes later, Leo was back with us, clean, cool and happy. No stressful car ride, nor waiting in queue at a site with loud dogs or other animals.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwCpk6JllTsEw2OnuAiFOiRGDcvrM57wN_BytU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

I also wanted to give a special thank you to Carlos and Joanna. Your extensive knowledge and passion in dog food really helped me adjust my dog's diet so that she is not overeating. I was buying dog food for months from there but never knew that I was accidentally over feeding her. They brought it to my attention and then spent over 30 minutes with me going through each of the foods and explaining exactly what benefits each ingredient has.<//text>

<review>To error is human. To forgive is devine. This company came back and groomed both of my schnauzers for the compromised price. They did a very good job. While we had a bumpy start, I appreciate there willingness to show my patronage mattered. This a sign of good faith and smart business. If you shared my original post, please share this as well.<//review><user_name>DOUGLAS BROWN<//user_name><response>None< /response><user>102488707316611969213</user><Pics>None</Pics>< GmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Adam and Art were the best! They arrived a little late but totally made up for it with excellent customer service and a job well done. Art was very understanding of my senior princess Winnie. She was afraid of the blow dryer but he took his time and had lots of patience with her. He even gave my other baby Rufus the mowhawk that we asked for. My two fur babies are so fresh and clean now. I absolutely love it. Definitely recommend using April's Furry Tail Mobile Grooming.

<review>I called 3 mobile groomers and only April responded.  She responded in a reasonable amount of time and was willing and able to work with our constraints.  She was on-time, courtesous, communicated excellently, did an excellent job with our large dogs, including one who had a lot of mats, and the dogs were not traumatized!  They liked her and her assistant a lot.  She even groomed a neighbor's dog after ours.  I have only good things to say about our experience.</review><user>115986086269932376071<//user>< rate>

I was unable to get my usual appointment with my groomer due to the lockdown so my dog was looking pretty scruffy. I decided to go down the mobile grooming route and I’m glad I did. April did an amazing job and my dog was almost unrecognizable in the best way. 5 stars from me and my dog Princess!<//Text>

<Text>My pup has been seeing April for his “summer cut” regularly for a few years now. He’s got some anxiety and can sometimes be aggressive during haircuts, but April is super patient with him. He has nipped at her before (sorry April!) but she has always been very kind and understanding about it. He always comes back fresh and neat, and somehow a bit calmer.

I made the mistake of trying another mobile groomer one time when April was unavailable. Never again. My dog was acting out and timid as soon as he got home. Tail between his legs.

I’ve stuck with April since. The service is a bit more expensive than going to a brick and mortar grooming salon, but I’m happy to pay for the convenience of the mobile truck coming to my home, as well as avoiding having my pup kept in a stressful kennel with a bunch of other barkers. I think it’s worth it.<//Text><name>Jullianne Medrano<//name>< date>

April is amazing. We won't see anyone else for our dog. Bella is always very happy after her appointments which tells me April treats her with kindness and care. I also LOVE how Bella looks when April gives her a cut and blowout - so clean and fluffy. April also adds a little cute bow on Bella, which we really appreciate. Highly recommend!<//text>

<Text>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! I used them today for a regular grooming and deshedding. I have no idea what they did to her but she came home and has been unable to literally walk since. So now I have to pay for a vet appointment on top of the grooming to figure out what happend. And even worse my dog was returned damp and now smells worse then before she was washed. Plus I still get a clump on hair on my hand when I go to pet her. When I tried contacting the company their response was "sorry we will let the groomer know your feedback" and "I dont know why dog cant walk". And REFUSED to give me any sort of a refund. If you care about you dog... DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!<//Text>< GmapID>

She was very quick to respond when I reached out and was able to confirm an appointment right away. On the day of the appointment she called to let us know she was arriving early. It's so nice not having to traumatize your cat with a car ride to the groomers!

We pointed out a few areas to watch out for when cutting his hair and nails. Our cat had an ingrown toenail and we were going to take him to the vet after the grooming appointment, but April told us she would be able to take care of it! As soon as she clipped his nail you could feel his body loosen up, he had been so tense. :-( Thanks to April, she saved me a trip (and bill) to the Vet! We will definitely be reaching out to her for his next appointment. Thanks April!< /text>< pics>

Punctual!! One of my rescue dogs was abused for 8 yrs and sufferings anxiety.  First thing April did was make sure my dog felt safe.  She warmed up to him and presto within an hour.. my dog with the cutest orange bow tie looking so so handsome.. he has the best cut ever and he was glowing.  I will be using April again!! Thanks again!!< /Review>

My dog Mac has always been really shy when approaching new people. Making sure April was aware of that beforehand, she showed up with treats for Mac and it totally got him to warm up to her immediately. She even let me sit in her mobile office just to ensure everything ran smoothly for the beginning of his haircut. Excellent service! After 15 minutes I left them to it and about an hour later April was finished. It was amazing how quick she was. Mac was trimmed, washed, nails clipped, even his tail was wagging. I could tell Mac enjoyed his custom bow tie by how excitedly he ran afterwards. Her friendly nature, timing, and experienced service is unmatched and that is why I won’t be going to anyone else.Thanks April!</review>

April is Awesome! My dog is a Chow/Rot mix and does not like going to the groomer. The last two were not able to groom him, as my dog was very uneasy and aggressive with them. No one will groom him.  I explained this to April and she showed up this morning, punctual, and with a smile. She was confident that she could groom him.  My dog liked her and although he didn't like the clippers, she handled it! He is beautiful and April has saved the day.  April explained that the fact t hat this is a mobile service, he is in his own familar environment and not around other dogs, or caged which helps him have a better overall experience.  The fact that he didn't bark when she approached surprised me. She pet him and he was comfortable with her from that point on.  The price was good. Thank you, April, for everything and the green bandana was perfect!  We have struck gold!!!< /review>

<Review>I set up an appointment with April for our bushy dog that needed a summer hair cut.  April showed up on time, did an excellent job, and put a cute ribbon on our groomed dog.  If you live in Los Angeles, give April a try.  She's great.  A+++++< /Review>< Pics>

April is the absolute best!! My two puppy dogs  Max and Sequoia don’t like baths normally, but they really like her.  April is completely reliable and utterly professional. And she does the most amazing job with them - Max and Sequoia have never felt softer or fluffier. I cannot say enough wonderful things about April and her team!! Highest recommendation possible!</Review>

<Review>April always got it all wrong   She caught my dog ear 😔😳😡😱 😰😭 And she didn't even apologize or let me know and she seems have no knowledge of dogs I tried her few times and Always my dog come back quick and stink but she was cheap so I thought you get what you paid for but she raised her price $50 that's almost 100% more and she claimed that she has a master groomer that's what you charge extra and now he's gone and she is still charge more for the same quality
my dog is being hurt in the last time he came back his ear is bleeding after he checks his head times and she didn't even tell me or apologize I will never use her again or recommend it to anyone if you love your animals don't call her it is so many good company out there honest and better quality she probably using cheap shampoo that's why my dog come back stink I figure she have a moving truck and claim she has a business it's it is a lot of grooming van Out there much more professional and well built special for grooming not for moving furniture stay away........................................................< /Review>< name>

April’s Furry Tail Mobile was the best mobile grooming and personal experience we have ever had!

Our 14 yr. old Havenese, Cuba,  is anxiety filled about grooming and a sensitive challenge for any groomer. In a last minute pinch before a dental surgery, I called April to see if she could groom him prior to his procedure. She was totally responsive, a great communicator via text and supportive. She created  a place in her very busy schedule to get to Brentwood and handle Cuba. With Love, attention and SKILL! She made it seamless today for all of us. THANK YOU! Thank you 🐶 We were completely cared for beyond our expectations.</text>

<user_name>Ms. Jackson< /user_name><review>I was looking for a mobile pet grooming service for our family dog MusiQ, and came across April's Furry Tail Mobile Pet Grooming. Let me tell you.. Everything was amazing from start to finish. April and her team were very professional and I was confident that I made the right decision for our dog. MusiQ has been through a lot and they were able to make him look sooooo nice. Thank you guys for being so friendly! They provide multiple payment options and arrived on time for our appointment. We will only call you from now on. Thanks again April and Team!< /review>< date>

The worst, cut off top of bump on my dogs leg and was not honest enough to say why my dog was giving them a hard time.  So she had a so called assistant who was doing the job while she sat doing nothing, I hired her not an assistant.  In that line of work you should know how to handle it other wise get training and learn how.  I paid her any way. I believe when you do dirt it allways comes back to you one way or another. Not trust worthy.<//review>

After going to about 5 different groomers and hating that my baby girl had to be in a cage (sometimes for over 2 hours) I stumbled across April’s Furry Tail Mobile Grooming and found my dream groomer

April is reliable, accommodating and quick 🙌🏼 Not only that but I know where my baby is and love the fact that she’s not in a cage

I highly recommend using her, she does a great job</text>

<text>Absolutely do not call  here.
she is (no class)  the first 2 appointments are not respectful .. and today she cut on my dog and she did not tell me, he was shaken and doesn't want to eat his favorite treat ?!!! and when i found out i called her she treated me in a disrespectful way and she insulted me, she denies it and told me that the dog wasn't bleeding and try to blame me for it, she does not respect her customers.. this is the most horrible experience for me and my dog. I will never use her again.<//text>< userid>

One of our favorite hangouts in OB when we visit. We came the other night not realizing that they close early. They never gave any indication they wanted us to leave. Super friendly service, great food and drinks. COVID safe. Extremely accommodating to pets. Amazing view, great people. You won't be disappointed.</Review>

Amazing breakfast, even better views right on the ocean! Sweet potato hash is a winner, as well as the burrito. I noticed the guy sitting not too far from us who got the eggs Benedict and that looked pretty sweet, so I tried not to be creepy while I took a picture of it. You’re welcome!< /Review>

Lovely brunch place right next to the Ocean beach.
Me with my boys wanted a good spot to get our day started and this place did not disappoint.

Variety of options to choose from , right from savory to sweet and all of us were pleased with the quality of the food and the service.

Will visit this place again if I am in town< /Text>

Not happy with my experience here. Slow service,  servers with blinders on, and a manager who says, sorry it's been rough. What they need is a staff with more training<//text>

Incomprehensibly terrible waitress. 1 hour wait for drinks, the place was MAYBE 20% capacity. Asked how we wanted our check, we said split, she responded, can we not do that? Food was incredible but FUHHHCK. GET SOME DECENT SERVICE. I'd call her out by name but she wasn't wearing a name tag. Seriously, wow. Edit: waitress - Adrienne, check yourself.<//text>

They were about to close but still had many people in. All the seats right now are separated with plastic shields, plenty available outside and inside. Their menu is different from what you see online - no tacos and only salmon/tuna/shrimp from the seafood options. No catch of the day neither. I had crab cakes-one of very few seafood options; and  hot chicken biscuit. Seemed like crab cakes is not a popular item - took awhile to arrive, actually the side dish it came with was amazing, crabcakes itself - okay, too mushy to my taste. Hot chicken biscut was great (came with fries). Biscuit was perfectly warm and slightly crunchy on the outside, but soft inside. Fried chicken was juicy and well seasoned - not too spicy though. Nice variety of drinks available - craft local beers, wines and selections of good quality spirits.< /text>

<Text>Didn’t take too long to get seated outside and the view of the Pacific is breathtaking - not to mention a lot of foot traffic by the patio.

To my surprise the food is cheap and with healthy portions!

Social distancing and mask-wearing are bearing enforced as well.

The only ding was service had been slow to bring water and felt at times the server forgot about us.

Besides that small ding it’s an otherwise awesome spot!< /Text>< Pics>

Waited 45 minutes for food to be served by a bearded waiter with his beard hanging over the food.  Kids run wild, screaming, drunks.  The management does nothing about it.  If you like chaos this is the place to go.  The restaurant is across a homeless incampment with freaks galore!</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>We were waiting so long before anyone came over to take our order. My husband's chicken and biscut was sitting in greese, which they said was the Garlic fries but if so they should have put that in a separate basket or plate. I got the omelet, it was the one w all veggies and it was bland and the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting for a while or frozen before cooked. The cold brew coffee was good. I ordered a hot coffee after that and it was on the cold side. To note, the waitress did take my husband's order and my luke warm coffee off the bill. It would be hard for us to return, we will have to try a different place in that same building because we love the view.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We visited this place in January, a bit out of season. Sat outside. We had omelette. Very delicious. Served fast from a friendly staff. WC. Parking in street. I’m not sure if they had entrance for wheelchair.<//review>

< review>
We were waiting so long before anyone came over to take our order. My husband's chicken and biscut was sitting in greese, which they said was the Garlic fries but if so they should have put that in a separate basket or plate. I got the omelet, it was the one w all veggies and it was bland and the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting for a while or frozen before cooked. The cold brew coffee was good. I ordered a hot coffee after that and it was on the cold side. To note, the waitress did take my husband's order and my luke warm coffee off the bill. It would be hard for us to return, we will have to try a different place in that same building because we love the view.< /review>

Our first visit to San Diego and OB Surf surely made our first breakfast on the Ocean Beach very memorable. Good service, tasty dishes, pet friendly, and amazing outdoor seating views. A real good experience for first timers to this beach. Public Parking available around the vicinity and accepts credit card.</Text>

<review>I'm a visitor to OB traveling alone and they found a nice little spot for me with an ocean view. I had the OB market parfait which was fresh and light, as well as an order of scrambled eggs and bacon. The spicy bloody mary was awesome as was the mai tai! Recommend early Sunday brunch because they get busy!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>Their Mai-Thais are dangerous, and I have loved all of the food I’ve eaten there.  I highly recommend the skirt steak, and their fried chicken appetizer.  if you're there early enough for breakfast/brunch, order the french toast with the fruit compote.  Makes a great brunch appetizer for 2 or more, or you can eat that for breakfast.

A dog friendly bar and restaurant.  There are 2 areas for dogs, outside on the deck overlooking the ocean, and on the patio where there is a traditional bar and enclosed seating area.<//Text><Name>Rob Lewis<//Name>< resp>

< Review>
Sunday brunch had a 45 minute wait but was able to sit immediately at the bar- was craving vegetarian biscuits and gravy and it hit the spot. Biscuits are very similar to Grands Biscuits which I like. Good customer service but would not choose the bar seating there again, constant wind brought in smells from the trash while I ate.</Review>

Visited on 12/15 with my girlfriend. The service was good , very positive attitude. We ordered 2  mimosa flights , pretty good flavors . Salmon toast was amazing , definitely coming back for it . Great views to the ocean . I also ordered the Farro lunch bowl and my friend had a chicken bowl . I thought it was good , but I could use more cauliflower and mushrooms in it . The chicken bowl was great and the tahini sauce was perfect .</text>

<Text>Love this place, right by the beach, good food, good service. They had reggae music playing and I could bring my dogs onto the patio and they brought them a water bowl. Banana pancakes and sweet potato hash we're awesome and I had a virgin bloody Mary that was good too. Great place.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Came here for brunch. Got here early before the crowds. Sat outside facing the ocean, has a great view. The food was amazing. I got the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly and was nicely seasoned. The service was excellent. My eggs were a little too over hard for me, there server instantly said she would get more and was back less than 5 min later with new eggs. I highly recommend and will be coming back.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

A great place to go for lunch while at the beach. The staff are all very friendly, also great music being played in the back ground. The chicken burger that I had tasted amazing, it was also well priced.< /review>

<Text>OB Surf Lodge is "good enough." The service was good and the location was great; can't beat the ocean view. The food itself is good, just nothing worth getting excited about. I had the Carnitas Benny; which is eggs Benedict with Carnitas on top of what I think was an English muffin. The muffin was flat and a bit rough l, Soni couldn't really tell what it was. I had a mimosa flight. It came with 4 kinds of mimosa. They were decent enough, but you could taste the syrup. I'd come back if only for the atmosphere, but there are better brunch spots in OB.</Text>< pictures>

Omg the view is amazing from where ever you sit we came for the sunset and wow.  The vibe is great,  and you feel like you are in another world!!! Food was great I had the salmon that was to die for and my fiance had the pork which was tender but lacking a little flavor. Our server Mike was cool and made everything great.  I love this place!</text>

<text>OB Surf Lodge is "good enough." The service was good and the location was great; can't beat the ocean view. The food itself is good, just nothing worth getting excited about. I had the Carnitas Benny; which is eggs Benedict with Carnitas on top of what I think was an English muffin. The muffin was flat and a bit rough l, Soni couldn't really tell what it was. I had a mimosa flight. It came with 4 kinds of mimosa. They were decent enough, but you could taste the syrup. I'd come back if only for the atmosphere, but there are better brunch spots in OB.</text>< pictures>

Been here several times and food never disappoint. Had a few people join us after we got sat and they were very accommodating. Always a great vibe. First time I tried their Main Tai and it's so damn good.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Great location with sunset views. Super Tasty Mai Tais. We really enjoyed the sample of Brussel Sprouts at the OB Restaurant Walk. They topped them with some aioli and pickled onions which was a delightful switch up from a lot of the similar Brussel spot out dishes!

The chicken fried steak was without a doubt the best I have ever had. But honestly everything we tried there was great. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area.</Text>

We went in today for a nice meal. The environment was great with beautiful beach views. Placed our food order and received our drinks.  I sent back my lemonade as something was floating in it.  Second lemonade came out with a spider in it.
Yes, a REAL SPIDER!!! How do you not notice a little black spider in a lemonade?...
We informed the waitress there was a spider in my drink. Her response” oh, it’s spider season in San Diego”. Like seriously????
I cancelled our order food and all. If you can’t get a drink right, how do I know what’s in my food!?
The waitress seemed surprised. Sorry gave her two chances to get a drink right and failed both times.< /review>

Super chill atmosphere across from the beach to grab a nice drink! My favorite is the shark attack and it's so nicely made! Great spot to soak in some vitamin d and grab a cocktail, beer, or some good eats!<//Review>

It was drizzling out so the staff sat us (dog included) inside near the patio. The breakfast menu was amazing! Great service and loved the fact they accommodated us even with the pooch in tow!< /Review>

My friend brought me here for breakfast when I was visiting from Phoenix over Thanksgiving. The LEMON FRITTERS!!!! Oh my goodness, AMAZING!  Breakfast was good, yes, but the fritters made me come back and bring my daughters on the next visit. They agreed whole heartedly!< /text>

< review>
I really wish I could've given this place more than two stars since the first time we ate here it was great food and service however, the second time was a huge disappointment. We arrived when there was no wait. I asked the hostess if she could add another chair to a specific empty table. She replied, "that table is only four chairs." I said, "okay, if it's not possible I understand we'll take whatever is available." She then led us to a back corner on the patio and just threw the menus on the ledge. We seated ourselves and then waited 15 minutes before a server came up to take our order. After the first order, the server hardly ever came to check on us. After sitting for over an hour we finally asked for the check without ordering entrees. I'm sure there was a reason behind why service was bad on a not busy time and the appetizer we did manage to order was delicious but, we will probably not revisit in the future regardless of how the food was.</review>

Bring an appetite. The jerk chicken is very tasty and the Brussel sprouts will fill you full of superhuman strength and powers for the surf across the street.</text>

Breakfast here was excellent. I had the classic eggs Benedict and also had biscuits that were legit.

The ocean view is great.< /Review>

Great bloody Marys! One one of the best brunches with beautiful views of the beach in San Diego! It overlooks the beach and the Ocean Beach pier. And the food is delicious. They also have outdoor patios that are dog friendly.< /Review>

And couldn't eat a second bite with the gravys off taste. On top of that $60 for breakfast for 3 people. Side note ma and pa shop on pier was excellent<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

Good food and good views. Solid happy hour. They have these happy hour biscuit sandwiches that are really tasty. The housemade biscuits are really good. They have a crisp outside and soft inside and are also sturdy enough to not crumble apart with each bite. They have this foam cream stuff they put in some of their beverages that is like crack. Super tasty. I would like to just drink it straight from the whipped cream dispenser contraption they put it in.< /Review>

Just happened across this place and it was amazing.  The food was spectacular, the mood is just kind of laid back and friendly.
Ate at the bar, bar tender was friendly and helpful gave me a coupe beer samples to try, great guy.
I'd highly recommend stopping in, enjoy the sunset, beer and awesome food.
Talked to a local and she said everything she had had here is amazing.
Definitely worth trying.</Text>

Views are amazing. We were seated quickly for a Sunday morning.  Service was fantastic. Locally roasted coffee was very, very good. I had the biscuits and gravy breakfast it was good, made in house according to server. Comes with scrambled eggs and potatoes. My sister had the eggs Benedict and enjoyed it. Overall a good breakfast spot with service putting it over the top. Will definitely be back!<//review>

<review>Great food and service.  I had an awesome bloody Mary and my friend had a delicious fruity drink concocted by the bartender.  The salmon Benedict was delightful with the right size portions.  (Some Benedicts that I eat leave me still hungry.)  The veggie scramble was also delicious my friend had said, but we forgot to remind them that she ordered there plate with additional mushrooms.  (I don't know if we actually paid for them.) It was a very good experience, but I would remind people to not wait at ther bar for your table, as the hostess doesn't call for you inside or at the bar.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Fun atmosphere, beautiful views and a great menu. I went there for brunch and had a strawberry vodka cocktail that was delicious.  My fried chicken biscuit was good but a little dry, my friends chilaquiles were well made but pretty mild.  A little hot sauce perfected both of our dishes.  Service was prompt and helpful, would definitely go back.</Review>

Food was great and they helped us with our strollers. Only complaint is that they were doing free shots for everyone around us but not us. We assumed bc we had babies. Hey- the moms weren't driving- we would have loved some LOL. But really, it was great food and we had fun.</Text>

Tourist trap honestly.

The premium price for the location is fine as the comfort of the ocean view is worth it.

Ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict but instead of lox, got cooked salmon under the poached eggs, wasn't terrible but definitely not what wasn't what I was expecting.

Service took really really long to note< /text>

My husband declares theirs to be the best spicy bloody ever. Ever! The fried cheddar omelet was unique (I've never had the cheese crisped on the outside), but come on, brocolini & duroc ham still aren't typical for a beach place.  My party of four found the portions generous and well executed. The patio is dog friendly and if you get cold quickly think about bringing a jacket with you in the mornings...the breeze off the beach is phenomenal!<//Review>

<text>Great food, for both breakfast and dinner. I prefer dinner, they've even made me a mimosa flight when I went at night (and they close it early) I love mimosas!! Great service every time! Staff friendly and willing to help if you have any questions or concerns. Bar is amazing, and good selection of drinks. Try the Barney! 😊 Will be returning regularly and with friends every time!</text>< user_name>

<text>I had the tahini chicken burger and it was delicious! It had a beet aioli and a slab of feta. I was in heaven.

Great location facing the beach. They don’t take reservations so go early. It gets pretty busy on the weekends around brunch time. Service can be a little slow.< /text><UserId.>107840331911198849637< /UserId.><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

I REALLY like the food at this place if you're not interested in healthy. It's a gluttony paradise, but if you want anything healthy or plant based for breakfast, good luck.  I wish they would include some healthy vegan options. Back when I didn't care about healthy eating I would get the eggs Benedict and OMG, it was SO good!!! This place has an awesome view as well.<//Text>

I went in a group and I so I got to taste some different things and they have one of the best black bean burgers that I've ever tasted. So that was a positive experience. The fettuccine, the mac and cheese, and the French fries were good.  If you are a vegetarian though make sure you specify for no meat. Two people in our group asked for no meat, but the server failed to point ot that the sauce had meat and the dishes had to be sent back. Overall we had a good time with mostly good food. Just a caution though to be sure you know what you're getting.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This place is amazing. It looks awesome inside and out, the food is amazing, and it's all just... Cool as hell. I will be honest; the immediate, "Hello and welcome! Find any seat you'd like." with being handed a menu for my mother and I, felt good. Though the wait for the initial food and drink service did take some time, it is understandable given it is a slow morning. The waitress was kind and wasn't too energetic, which kinda went hand in hand with the theme of the place. I did feel bad though, because I was enjoying the entirety of the brunch menu, but I ultimately settled on the Smothered Omelette with apple juice. You can't go wrong with anything on the brunch menu, everything just sounds so good, and then when you get the actual plate, it's even better. 5/5 Will take family and friends here again.</text>

Amazing views.  Beautiful and delicious food.  A must if you are looking to kick it on style and enjoy some Bloody Mary's, mimosa's, or day time cocktails.  Check it out for a popping night scene as well.</text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>First time here, wasn't bad right at the start. It was our service that was bad. Our server Monique, was not very nice, she said we couldn't keep a menu to keep looking. Which we would have ordered more drinks or food. But couldn't look at a menu...then when our drinks came, a frozen drink, it didn't come with a straw. Understanding, San Diego restaurants are not serving them without requests now. But then when she brought them to us, she basically tossed them at us. Willing to come again, the food and other drinks people had looked good. Just not going to sit in Monique's area.</Text>< pics>

<review>This place is great. I've been here 10+ times, and they have always been able to facilitate the small or large party of people that I bring with minimal wait time. Also the polenta shrimp is where at!! Great food AND drink menu. I always try something different, and I'm never disappointed.< /review>< Pictures>

The food is excellent. I had the Carnivorous Scrambler and my sister has strawberry French toast. Both were fantastic and I will definitely be returning soon.<//Text>

Great views of the beach. Good drinks, and their food was delicious. I get to San Diego at least once a year, and a stop at OB Surf Lodge had become a part of the trip.<//review>

<Review>My husband and I had our first date here when it was Shades in April 2007. We love the ocean view, the surfers, the dogs, and all the local color. It's our special place. The new management seems to have captured the essence of this sacred OB space - right on the water, next to the OB Pier, casual but elegant too. It's a bit pricier than it use to be - Bloody Mary's were $10 each, breakfast was $15 each, and a $50 dollar bill after we looked up from the waves. It didn't use to cost that! Nonetheless, we always go to this spot when we're visiting San Diego from the Palm Springs desert area. The OB Pier is our special spot. I just wish the new management had a drink special for us budget travelers. We shouldn't have to carry an AMEX card to go here.  This is OB man!<//Review>< gmapID>

The sweet potato dish is awesome!  I used to come here when it was Shades and can say that Surf Lodge is an upgrade. We were headed to Wonderland for a late breakfast/early brunch but they were closed so we ended up at the Lodge instead. We weren't disappointed. Great food, great view, and cool staff.</review>

Cool new eatery with walk up outdoor bar and regular seating inside.  Modern decor, 30+ craft on tap, and a full menu with burgers, steak, seafood, salads and veggie friendly fare.  Killer view of the pier and sunsets as well.  Except when Cloudy!< /Review>

It is generally pretty good, be careful of burnt pancake being strategically placed at the bottom of the stack, happened more than once.  Update: Their pancakes seem much more consistent and always fluffy and nice these days, great job. Love everyone working there. Bumping up from 4 to 5 stars.<//Text>

Fancy homestyle food with Californian / Mexican influences. Some food brunch and lunch options, tons of omlettes and some good sandwiches to boot. Good view of the ocean from the house, the inside would be better in the winter given the close proximity to the ocean.<//Review>

<review>Its been at least 30 minutes since we have been seated which was also a wait, and i have seen any servers out besides behind the bar. Just wondering if ill ever get service?? Kinda wanted to at least try the food
(UPADTE): I realize they must be understaffed for mothers day, but we had to walk over a grab our own drinks from the bar to see THE MANAGER TAKING SHOTS AT THE BAR, when we complain they tell us they are doing a great job and that we should tone it down. The waitress that helped us was running around like crazy trying to help people and was obviously stressed out and he had the nerve to tell us he was doing all he could do.
THE FOOD: Was actually great when it got here. I was very happy with my breakfast burritos  and the only reason i gave more than one star would be for the food.
Service needs improvement<//review>< Pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>My family and I went here today around noon to have lunch. The guy in the front said it would be about 15 minutes till we are seated. It took a bit longer but after reading the great reviews, we didnt mind. When we were finally seated around 12:40, the waitress took our drink order. The drinks came out quickly and we ordered shortly after. We noticed a couple who was seated prior to us still did not have their food and it was already 1. We waited almost an hour and still no food. Our waitress said the kitchen was backed up and said the food should come out soon. We saw a table of 5 near us get their food an hour later even though they were seated after us. The manager told my fiance they would push up our order. We waited over an hour for our waitress to then tell us our order would be placed in front. We ended up walking out after being there a total of 2 hours with no food. We wish we would have had a better experience but it seems like an hour wait for food is normal here. We had two kids with us and didnt want to keep waiting. My fiance used to work in the food business and said there is no reason to wait over an hour for food. I wouldnt go back after our experience.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Got seated immediately, but sat there with my wife and daughter for 15 minutes and not a single person helped us. They didn't ask for a drink order or anything. People got seated next to us and helped instantly. Will NEVER go back to this place again.< /review>

They give you tap water that is rated at 485TDS.
Max EPA contamination level is at 500. So this is very contaminated.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

One of our favorite spots for brunch. Great quality food. Perfect for families and fun with friends. Can't beat the location right on the beach (basically). Definitely recommend the chicken biscuit sandwich or scramble depending on your preference.<//Text>

Excellent brunch overlooking Ocean Beach. Great food, great vibe, but lose out on 5 stars 'cos they don't have a real espresso coffee machine. Everyone loves cappuccinos with brunch, right?< /review>

The bartenders could really use some smiles and better attitudes! They should also try picking there heads up so they can sell a few more rounds! That being said the food was great and always is but being in the service industry myself I will never accept the lack of service I received today!</Review>

Avoid the orange juice at all cost, you'd be better off sucking on lemons (which totally ruined the Mimosas).

Great view of the ocean. Good stop for quick bites after a beach visit. Parking can be a challenge, but there is a garage under the building. When I was there, the bathroom had a huge leak in the ceiling. This place is usually very loud and crowded.< /Review>

I love this place!!! The food and drinks are awsome. I love the restaurant's atmosphere and the staff is so fun and full of energy. I ordered the salmon dinner and fault of my own forgot to mention how I like my salmon cooked. They took it back with no charge and the Chef brought it out to me personally...I thought that was so cool!!! I got to meet the man who makes it happen, Chef Khoury...great guy and love his personality!!! Would most definitely go there again and will highly recommend this restaurant to others!!!!<//review>

<Text>This place was a wonderful surprise!  Trying to find a somewhere  that cooked fresh cuisine (soy allergy)and could not have found a better meal! The chef came out and  reassured us its all freshly prepared. I had today's market fish which was the most delectable halibut in a white sauce served with roasted root veggies  (baby zucchini, small squash) and a pan seared swiss chard that was the best I've ever had. Hubby had the hanger steak (a flank steak marinated to such tenderness), garlic mashed and some vegetables (I didn't see or try those ).  The bill came to $48 and I even had a $6 drink.  Deal of the century!!  Full-on gourmet that would have cost twice as much anywhere else (we even ate outside staring at the ocean) to complete the top-notch dining experience!!  Will so be back next time in Ocean Beach!!!

So the place looks amazing, right on the beach. But the food was a waste of money. I had a breakfast where the biscuit was like a brick, the sausage was also hard and bland... and the eggs were the only thing that didn't weight a ton.
And this worse than McDonald's breakfast cost me $15. I'm all for trend and so on but no thank you. There sister bar "wonderland" is amazing but after trying this once I am not a fan.</text>

All of our cocktails and specialty drinks have specific ingredients and recipes to ensure that they taste the same no matter who is serving it to you. We will look into this to ensure we are delivering the same great experience for our guests in the future. Thank you and we hope you will come and see us again!'}< /Response>< Review>
My husband and I were there today specifically for the taste of a mail tai that we experienced the first time we ordered it. Oddly, we haven't been successful. He ordered it and I ordered the coconut version. Totally disappointed with the regular one; we were hoping third time's a charm. My coconut version was heavenly but I afraid to try it again. Ugh~ The cost of eating out, I guess.</Review>

Good food if a bit pricey with a great view of the ocean. I had fried cheese curds, which were delicious but a small portion for an appetizer.</Review>

<Text>So the place looks amazing, right on the beach. But the food was a waste of money. I had a breakfast where the biscuit was like a brick, the sausage was also hard and bland... and the eggs were the only thing that didn't weight a ton.
And this worse than McDonald's breakfast cost me $15. I'm all for trend and so on but no thank you. There sister bar "wonderland" is amazing but after trying this once I am not a fan.< /Text><Date>1493743354626<//Date>< Rating>

We love OB Surf Lodge for brunch (haven't tried dinner yet).  Location is beautiful, the service is excellent and the food is fantastic (love, love, LOVE the sweet potato hash but everything I've tried as been good).  We are, and will continue to be, regulars.< /text>

<Text>Awesome drinks and service. Mike the waiter was great, as was the "Lost in Jalisco"

Update: Came back for brunch and, again, the food was fantastic. Carnitas Benny was awesome, with tender carnitas, awesome Ancho hollandaise sauce, and green chillies. The server, Catie, was great and the food came out quickly. The only issue was the hostess. Seemed like a chore for her to do her job and that she would rather finish her personal conversation with her coworker while we stood there instead of setting the table and seating us. Maybe the hosts don't get a portion of the tips? Anyway, a small hiccup, and still a 5 star experience.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Food is so so, they can't decide if they're a high end, small portions restaurant, a hipster spot, or a comfort food/tourist spot.  But, they're in such a popular location, they don't have to decide.

Their drinks, though, are like a tiki bar dream.  Great beer selection, delicious mai tai, some neat original, tropical cocktails.</Text>

They don't have the biggest selection of food but the taste and quality of it makes up for it. I also like the fact that I can bring my dog.< /review>

<text>This place is an extension of Wonderland. The menu is different but the atmosphere is exactly the same. I had the opha sandwich which was great. Drinks are on the pricey side, but you're paying for the atmosphere and location.<//text></record>

<Text>Food is so so, they can't decide if they're a high end, small portions restaurant, a hipster spot, or a comfort food/tourist spot.  But, they're in such a popular location, they don't have to decide.

Their drinks, though, are like a tiki bar dream.  Great beer selection, delicious mai tai, some neat original, tropical cocktails.</Text><rate>3< /rate>< Pics>

What a bad experience i was on the bar for 1 hr abd the bartender keep ignoring me. It was not so busy for him to ignored me like that. I really feel the racial profile. i was the only latina in the bar. Im saying this because is not the first time i come here , i usually come here with my firends that happen to be caucasian so i thougth i can come here on my own. never again i really feel disrespected< /Text>

Went in for a beer and shady bartender took all my money off the bar as tip.  101 of bartending, leave the change until the customer leaves it for you.  I wonder if the extra dollar or two tip is worth the bad pub.<//Review>

The food is good, but not exceptional, especially for San Diego. The view is fantastic. It's loud inside, so not a great place to chat with a table full of people.< /review>

<Review>Breakfast here is wonderful! The Carnitas Benedict and Sweet Potato hash are super tasty.. Lively, energetic atmosphere that matches well with the Sunday morning beach vibe. The staff was great. Very attentive and accommodating, especially Evan. She was more than pleasant. Very personablel, yet professional, offering wonderful suggestions.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Good food but EXTREMELY LONG wait. We waited 30 minutes to sit, waited another 20 at least to order, our food took at least an hour then the waitress took FOREVER to bring our check. We were visiting for the day and this stop took way to much of our time. They need to hire more staff.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) We used the OB Surf Lodge for a stop for a beer. Both draft beers did not taste good. A bit too bitter. Then there is quite a lot going on in the restaurant, because there is no alternative to go grooming food or drink nearby.
The table stuck oh why always. It was still interesting to sit in the front row behind the glass and watch the people and cars.

(Original)
Wir nutzten die OB Surf Lodge für einen Stop auf ein Bier. Beide gezapfte Biere schmeckten uns nicht. Eine zu bittere Note. Dann ist ganz schön los in dem Restaurant, denn es gibt in der Nähe keine Alternative etweder um gepflegt Essen oder Trinken zu gehen.
Der Tisch klebte wieso ach immer. Es war trotzdem interessant in der ersten Reihe hinter dem Glas zu sitzen und die Menschen und Autos zu beobachten.<//Text>

<Time>1557173854142< /Time><Text>(Translated by Google) VERY good meat with vegetables, my friends have taken burgers and confirm that they have eaten very well, congratulations also for the excellent beers, the only flaw was the girl behind the counter always angry, she had a very nervous face. But overall we customers treated us very well

Carne con verdure MOLTO buona, i miei amici anno preso hamburger e confermano di aver mangiato molto bene, complimenti anche per le birre ottime, l'unica pecca era la ragazza dietro il bancone sempre arrabbiata, aveva una faccia molto nervosa.
