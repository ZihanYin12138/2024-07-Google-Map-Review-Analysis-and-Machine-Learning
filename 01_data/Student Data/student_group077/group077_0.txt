This bakery has all of those thickly iced and creamy pastries and cakes I dream about! We stopped here for dessert celebrating my birthday last Saturday and I had been craving a creamy mocha cake. And they had it in individual serving size! Yay!<//Text>

The vegetable sandwich is delicious and the Vietnamese (aka bahn mi) sandwich is solid (their buns are so good). So are the pastries. We really liked the “sampler” where you get 3 smaller versions of their pastries for $5. Cute outdoor dining area, nice staff. Great place, will eat there again!< /text>

< Review>
Firstly, I appreciate the customer service. It was my first time visiting and I didn't feel rushed.
I ordered macaroons, a chai latte, and pre-ordered a straeberry & cream cake! Macarons are delicious and fluffy, and huge! In my opinion. Usually you find them a lot smaller in other bakeries. The latte was yummy, and they also have Vietnamese coffee if you're in search of q place.
As for the cake, it looked delicious, so I hope my eyes are on par with my taste buds.
But really, service is key and I was impressed. Trying to support our small and local businesses 👍<//Review>

This place has delicious French pastries and macarons (no not coconut macaroons, but the almond meringue macaron). When they are allowed to serve meals here they have quiche and other dishes with a French flair.< /text>

<Text>Love this place . The decor is so cute yet elegant .everything inside is clean .Feels like you are in a small cafe in france.  The owner is really nice . The food is absolutely amazing.  Its very hard to find authentic french pastries ( its usually fusion) . This place is the real deal . Its perfect for birthday cakes ,special events or to spoil yourself if you are a sweet tooth . The price are fairly raisonable compare to the french bakeries in LA or OC . Best french cafe in san bernardino/ inland empire county. This place is a gem in rancho cucamonga.  The orders are always prepared quick . I strongly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't try it yet .< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>My husband and I have been eyeing this place and finally stopped in today. We were so pleasantly impressed. We tried the Ham & Cheese Croissant and pastries. Man oh man was it amazing. I want to say thank you to the owners the place is gorgeous, could use a deep clean in the lounge area with the times like a really good dusting as they have fake flowers and decor is a bit crowded. All the food looks super fresh, made to order and gorgeous pastries. Everything was delicious. Can’t wait for things to get safer so I can take my family in there and spoil them with pastries and tea time for like a birthday or Mother’s Day. Over all will be returning soon!<//text>< Pictures>

Just found this cafe due to the AAA magazine Westways. Ran out of the house to get their Bahn Mi sandwich. Best I've ever had. Yummy. The almond croissant was delicious, too.< /Review>

The pastries... one word. WOW. Macaroons, croussaints, tarts, tiramisu... dude... my sugar addiction went to nirvana... oh and the almond chocolate chunk cookies just... i couldnt believe it. And the truth is I only came here because 85° bakery off rochester was packed since it was valentines day and ohhh what a blessing that was. So happy that happened because this place is 🔥🔥🔥<//Text>

Very beautiful place. Perfect for a lunch date. I recommend the spinach quiche or the Parisian crêpe. Not very happy with the service. I have been there 3 times and it has been slow every time, even when there is no one else ordering. If you don't mind waiting, the food (at least what I have tried) is good.< /Text>

OMG!! Just had the best Vietnamese sandwich, the bread they use is just out of this world!  Could not leave without any pastries. Tried the chocolate tart, bought a couple of what looks like cream puffs, but had fruits on top. The kids said they were very good. Also bought a hazelnut pastry with hazelnut cream and crunchy candied hazelnuts on top. Everything was good, will be back to try their almond chocolate croissant and their giant palmiers and their bolognese lasagna.<//review>

Lovely croissants, delish pie/cakes and beautiful decor. Would have received full marks but the man who helped us was abrupt and made us feel like an inconvenience. Still... well worth the trip for deliciously decadent treats< /Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I really enjoy trying new places, needless to say I was so excited to try this place out. The wedding cake is not okay. The bread is little dry, but the frosting and fruit are good. The minis cakes 3 for 5 is not bad because you can taste a little of all if you don't really want to commit to. My husband had the cotton candy frap which he really enjoyed. I had an ice coffee and it tasted really watered down. The service was good but the pasteries werent what I expected as they looked much pretty to look at. The chocolate lil square on the picture I have tastes like chocolate moose. The fruit tart is good.<//Text>< Pics>

I went there on a nice summer day because I was recommended by a friend. They told me that the food was of a true French essence and that I must visit. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I have been visiting for several months now and the food is very good. I ordered a croissant which was 100% the best croissant I've ever eaten in my life. I would recommend everyone to go and try. The staff was super nice and helped me order and the place was clean.</review>

My husband and I are here at least once a week! I’ve gotten pastries just for myself and also for family get togethers. The owners moved here from France and are not 100% fluent in English. They are classically trained and therefore you are getting authentic French Pastries and baked goods. We are also here for brunch a lot and my favorite is the Quiche Epinard and Chèvre (spinach and goat cheese) and my husband loves their turkey sandwiches which is made with baguettes they make here too.< /review>

PROS:
Friendly owner provided good service. Clean and attractive ambiance and decor. Visually appealing and attractive baked goods. Menu extends beyond the bakery including French style sandwiches and croissant sandwiches.

CONS:
Based on the one mini eclair and mini tart, it might seem that they were good, but not the freshest. We picked them up arounf 2 pm. So, that might have been a factor.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c335def4b3c8d5:0x695754ba422df9ff</gmapID></record>

Very nice spot with quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Had the berry croissant. It was excellent - the perfect size with fresh berries. They offer a large variety of desserts along with fresh made meals. Definitely plan to go back.<//review>

Cute little Paris bakery cafe in Rancho Cucamonga. It's a family owned and run business. It's adorable from the first step you take in. The sweets are delicious. I got the coconut cake and lime tart. The macroon were soft, definitely get the Nutella one and strawberry. The Earl grey macroon was a little hard. Great tea and coffee selection. Very comfortable seating, great for an afternoon desserts and tea or a late evening relaxation. They have a kids play section too!< /Review>

<Review>I've been to Paris maybe 3-4 times, usually in the late afternoon. I would recommend coming earlier as most items are already sold out by evening. Only that first evening was I able to snag most of my goodies - ever since that first visit, most of the cakes were already gone by the time I arrived. Prices are also fair for the quality of desserts and pastries. If you order more than 2-3 items of the same variety, you actually get a discount. And if you mix and match between the mini cakes, you can score 3 for $5.

My favorite item that I've tried has got to be the Palmier. It's $3.50 for one, but the size is humongous - bigger than my head (I have a picture for proof!) and even after a few days, the dessert was still as crispy and sweet as ever. Loved that the outer edges were crispy and sweet, but the inner layers were more soft and flaky.

Almond croissant/almond chocolate croissant at $3.99 each - I didn't get to eat the croissants the same day, but after popping it into the toaster oven, the croissant was still flaky and delicious. I prefer the almond with almond paste inside, but the chocolate wasn't too bad either. I do think that the croissant could have a little more almond paste and be a little sweeter - not my favorite almond croissant, but I would get these again. I've also tried the bread pudding ($3.99), which I feel is a little bit on the pricier side. I saw a lot of raving reviews, and I do think it's tasty but not as flavorful or sweet as I would have preferred. My friend isn't a big fan of super sweet desserts, so he thought this was perfect.

As for the cakes - my favorite is the wedding cake ($4.99 for each slice of cake). Kind of reminded me of the berries and cream cake from Porto's, but instead of berries, this one only had strawberries. The cake was a little melted by the time we dug into it - but the flavor was still there. The cream on the outside was creamy yet lightly whipped while the inside, the strawberries were mixed with a sweet pudding almost. And the cake was light and airy, making for a very delicious bite.

The tiramisu and fraisier cakes were also tasty - I liked the tiramisu a little more because the taste was heavier and richer, but the fraisier resembled a soft cheesecake almost because of the texture. It was super light and not too sweet; can probably eat an entire slice without even realizing it. Black forest was probably our least favorite - not a big fan of the cherries inside, but taste was - again - not sweet and had a good chocolate flavor.

And on another visit, I got the opalys - an almond mousse and raspberry filling inside of an orb. Price was around $5-6, but the dessert is so beautiful and captivating that I didn't mind paying that price to be able to try the flavors. This was a light mousse that had a hint of almond flavor to give the dessert some sweetness, but the added acidity from the raspberry made it perfect. I wouldn't mind ordering another one of these - or trying other flavors of the special orbs that they make.

Don't forget the macarons! One is $2.99, but if you buy more, the prices get cheaper. I bought several for my friend one night, but came back and tried a caramel flavor for myself. Not sure how often these macarons are replenished, but they seem to always have an assortment of flavors in stock. The shell is more chewy than crumbly, but the flavor of that caramel was so tasty and rich, that I didn't mind the kick of sweetness. Getting into the middle of the macaron, it definitely had a chewiness that I enjoyed. Price is a little high, but the size of the macaron is pretty good.

tl;dr - Will be returning as often as I can. Highly recommend the cakes and palmier as well as their special dessert items. The people helping us were are all super friendly and helpful. Décor of the place is extremely cute - too bad there isn't any indoor seating. Can definitely go crazy with all my photos if I was able to enjoy my desserts inside.</Review>< user_id>

I've been going here since the week they opened and it's unique, charming, and deliciously authentic. I haven't had anything I didn't love. The tarts are amazing, the cakes are perfect, and the sandwiches are the best. They even make a great cup of coffee!the people are wonderful as well. It's perfect for any meal and you can take what you want to go.</text>

<text>The pastries were so good! They were all super cute too! The only thing that I didn't really like was how loud it was. Babies were crying while I was trying to order something. It's definitely not a good place to study or even meet people for meetings.

Other than that, I highly recommend their desserts!</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Best crossiants in the inland empire. Plain, choclate almond ( personal fave) and Almond are flaky and not overly sweet. They also have a killer fruit tart with a buttery short bread crust that is great host gift  or  dessert.<//text>

Not sure why people like this place so much. I went there withy family to try the desserts and got to try at least 8 different items. All of them looked beautiful, but were absolutely tasteless. We were all quite amazed by how something can look so good but be so bland. Don't come here if you've been to Europe and think it will have similar quality, you'll be disappointed.<//text>

This has now become my husband's and my favorite weekend treat. Not only do they have a great cafe late but every pastry we've tried has been amazing. Our favorites are the macaroons, absolutely melt in your mouth. I love all their small size options so you can try a couple if you can't make up your mind.<//review>

<text>First time visit and I agree with other reviews.  Really cute place, nice staff, and amazing looking pastries, but the service is extremely slow.  Nice place to relax and meet friends...plan to have patience.  I would go back.< /text>< pics>

Delightful decor with lovely spacious patio. Fun outing for an intimate lunch. Desserts are so very incredible. Inviting leisure areas to relax on comfy sofas. Great for a ladies day out amazingly child friendly.< /review>

<review>My girlfriend and I drive by here all the time and decided to stop by on recommendations from some friends. The owner is super nice and helpful. He was able to provide us with recommendations and let me just tell you that chocolate almond pastry was AMAZING soft and gooey inside and nice and crispy on the outside. Perfect with a cup of coffee! They also have other non pastry dishes that I saw but was unable to try. I will have to go back here in the future!!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>In terms of their cakes, breads, and foods, they are awesome.

However, in terms of their service, they are seriously terrible.

Today, I went there to purchase a whole cake that has a price tag of about $26-$27. (I had purchased the same cake before and was aware of the price.)

However, when I was paying for the cake, they said it's over $40.
They mentioned that it is the same cake but in larger size.

Because I chose that cake based both on my previous experience AND the price, I said whether they can offer any discount from putting an incorrect price tag.
After a short period, they mentioned that the chef would not want to give any discount.
Because I really liked the cake, I paid the full price.

Then, another staff came out from inside and started to explain that the price tag I saw was for a smaller size (however, there was no smaller size cake(s) of the same kind. The cake I chose was the only one on display) and she also told me that she can show me the difference in sizes.
(She said the cake I chose today was an 8-pieces cake, while the one I had purchased previous was a 6-pieces cake)

Well, since customers do not usually notice whether a cake is 8-pieces or 6-pieces when there is nothing to compare, I said that they should have put the correct price tag instead of trying to justifying themselves.
She didn't apologize and kept teaching me about the difference in size.
I felt that she thinks it's my mistake of incorrectly guessing the size of a cake (with an incorrect price-tag attached) and not their mistake of not putting a correct price-tag.

If she had apologized, then I would have fully understood and purchased the cake.
However, because she started with justification and kept teaching me instead, I finally cancelled the purchase.

By the way, the other staff who was there at first (not the one who came out later and tried to teach me) was polite.

Even if their bakery items and food are great, if their service is not changing, then I think they will lose customers eventually.
They seriously need to educate their staffs first.</text>< Pics>

Excellent ! I am French and work close by, that's definitely my favorite lunch place and were I can rediscover the taste of a crepe or a quiche lorraine. But the best part is the dessert, it's just very difficult to choose one among the huge variety of choice. I highly recommend this place if you are around<//text>

<Text>My neighbor brought us some pastries from this place. I was hesitant to eat one because they did look too sweet but they really weren't. They were delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. I ended up eating two of them! I'm hooked now and will have to go there myself to check out the selection.</Text><userid>116973071099810562923</userid><Date>1494439345446</Date><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>They have great pastries!!! My biggest concern with this place is that they are not organized when taking the food orders and delivering it to you when the food item(s) in question are ready; after waiting for my sandwich over half an hour, which they said they would take it to my table; they did not and when I went to asked for it; the person who I think was the owner grabs it from their counter and hands it to me without apologizing for the mishap on their part; talk about making sure customer service goes hand in hand with the quality of the food you are offering!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Service is Extremely slow. We waited almost a half hour before we got our coffee, due to the fact that the girl at the counter had no help and we waited till she was done before we approached the counter asking for our coffee. If this place continues to run this way, it will kill the business as their pasteries and plates are very good.< /Text>

<Text>Excellent quality. But the wait is too long. 1 hour for 3 sandwiches and a salad.  Customers who came after us were served before and no one was ahead of us. This has happened on the last 2 times I've visited.</Text>< Name>

Super cool little pastries shop! Grab a seat on a plush couch inside or head outside to the patio, and get ready to enjoy a whole assortment of finely decorated little bundles of joy!!< /review>

Amazing people!! And pastries are tasty. Me and my brothers went in 10mins before they closed and noticed that they actually stayed open 30mins over closing time due to constant customers showing up. Their almond croissant is delicious and my favorite. Their lemon tart is also very good. I would recommend this place to anyone!!<//Text>

This is a nice cafe, the Vanilla macaron, vegetarian Crepe and croissant were all equally great. Ample indoor as well as outdoor seating, clean space. They provide great customer service and order was ready on time as well.< /text>

<Text>For the type of pastries that they are serving the prices are reasonable.  I ordered a rasin pastry and they put golden raisins!  It made for a more delicate flavor.  Can't wait to try everything else eventually.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c335def4b3c8d5:0x695754ba422df9ff<//GmapID>< Resp>

Incredible. I highly recomend the Opalys and the Fracheur. its so different from what I’m used to but so delicious! There is a little bit of a language barrier from the french staff but they are so lovely and eager to help. You can tell they take pride in their work. This is my new local pastry shop for something different than the usual donuts and cupcakes that you can get anywhere else<//text>

< Review>
We stopped by here in our way to K Towne 88 to get some coffee and were delighted by all of the pastries and offerings here.

Decor

This place has a cute Parisian theme with indoor and outdoor seating. The facility is clean and gives off a family vibe.

Food

I ordered the bread pudding and a caramel blended drink and my wife ordered a tarte fruit. The tarte fruit was subtly sweet and the fruit was fresh. The bread pudding was thick and moist. I suffered a brain freeze from the caramel blended drink. Drink it slowly since it's very cold but very good.

Verdict

If you're in the area and craving sweets, Paris pastries is an excellent choice for tasty treats.</Review>

Happened upon this place while killing time before a flight. My friend and I were looking for coffee and some pastries. This place was so amazing we stayed for lunch. Pear tart, chocolate croissant, fruit eclair. Amazing. Espresso and latte perfect. Then lunch. Croque mouisur.....to die for. Amazing bread, buttery sauce, ham and gruyere topped with a perfectly cooked medium egg. Even the side salad was delish. Unfortunately I'm in the bay area but will definitely be back if I'm in the area. Oh and the owner was very nice too.<//review>

We like a lot going out. Yesterday we came to this superb restaurant which friends recommended to us. We spent a lovely evening there with first-rate dishes and a professional stuff and a great cook. We  added this restaurant in our phone list  and we will definitely return very soon.  Highly recommended.</review>

<Review>We were traveling on the 14 and the hubby remembered seeing this place in passing.  So we called and ordered, jumped off the freeway to pickup. It was the cutest find. The young woman that waited on me was very nice. The one on the phone never acknowledged me but it was cool. The pizza was so good and cheesy.  We just wanted travel food on our way to our mini vacay! Great job, hot, crunchy crust, cheesy and just PERFECT!
THANKS KELLY!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>First time visiting this place. I phoned in a cold roast beef sandwich for pickup.  They said it would be ready in 15 min. 20 min later I arrived and had to wait an additional 15 min.They advertised sandwich on a fresh toasted French roll with a pickle spear.  About 3 min. later I parked down the street to eat and found a cold, hard sorry excuse for bread, and not toasted bun.  No pickle and not to mention while I was there waiting for my order they had a sign that read lunch special "any cold sandwich with side and a drink for 9.99. I paid 10.37 for a sandwich.  I will never visit this place again.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We ordered 3 pizza’s , all different. One of the pizza’s  was not what we order. I tried calling them right away so they could catch the driver I was on hold for almost 5 minutes. By this time it was to late now they delivered 2 wrong pizzas, they said they would make a new one and rush it over. We eat as a family so we waited for the new. An hour later I called still no pizza. 10 minutes later they finally delivered it. The other two are now soggy and cold.<//Review>

<Date>1603512310098</Date><user_name>Derrick Skipper<//user_name><Review>Ordered  out once and they got my order terribly wrong. I wanted peppers and onions  along with pepperoni and jalapeños. I ended up getting a Supreme smothered in black olives

Stirke two. They sent me the wrong pizza again everything I wanted  except onions were replaced by mushrooms.  I never  asked for mushrooms

Strike three. They accused  me of "pizza hustling" and never brought me the correct  pizza i ordered in the first place and will only refund me. The customer  service  here is terrible.  I will never order here again. Nor would I recommend  them.  All I wanted was one simple pizza from a pizza place and they couldn't get it right not only once but twice. Then accuse me of hustling them.

Strike four. They don't honor their refund. Their employees lie about what was on the pizza. Neither one had the onions  i asked for. Their customer service  is the worst and they try to make you the bad guy when all you want is what you paid for. They straight up robbed me tonight.</Review>< user>

Fast, huge pizzas, packed full to the brim. It was delicious and they will deliver free to thousand trails if you mention it during your call. We got the supreme, Large and the cheesy garlic bread. Very well priced, great customer service and amazing pizza. Will order again soon!<//review>

<Text>Had the personal calzone, pepperoni and sausage. While the 2 ends are honestly magnificent, the ricotta cheese in the middle was not even lukewarm. The crust was even crisp and flaky; just the middle as honestly awful. The quality of the ingredients aren't spectacular, but I think i spent less than 9 dollars on it. Worth, in my opinion, just get that center nice and hot next time:)</Text><UserId.>111272882766607204390</UserId.><user_name>Eli Phillipson< /user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>The only reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because I dont understand why tomatoes are on the caesar salad and the dressing tastes like italian not caesar. Also the fettuccini alfredo tasted sweet which if that's a mess up on the prep cooks fault I understand but if that's how you guys do things then I'm good on that. The rest of the stuff like the fried tortellini and the fried chicken are awesome, and I've never had a problem with the pizza the last few times I've been there but it baffles my mind on who would put tomatoes on caesar and try and pass italian as caesar dressing. So great on pizza and chicken. Meh on salads and pastas.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Food is almost the same under the new ownership. The small town feel and small community that I loved for the last almost 30 years seems to have evolved into the technology age. What really disappointed me is they stopped carrying coke products and changed the name of the pizza's.
Myself, my siblings, and a whole bunch of friends who grew up here could always have a job at The pizza place all through high school. Hope that it continues for Acton/Agua Dulce natives.</Text>

UPDATE: Met with new owner today to discuss our order. He was already aware of the situation.  He is working hard to remedy the quality of food. Very nice guy... wishing him the best is his pizza venture. Thank you for taking the time to make thing right. 😊

Waited over 1 hour for a to go order. I can't tell you how it tasted, I have another 1/2 hour before I get home. We used to eat here a least once a week. Pizza place needs some organization. The blonde behind the counter never checked on our order. I think Tom was embarrassed about the situation.  🙁<//review>

<review>What a great place!  When we came in, we weren't sure what we wanted, so we decided to try a little bit of a few things.  We started with the mozzarella sticks and the fried raviolis - these guys know their way around a fryer!  I could have ordered a dozen of the fried raviolis and nothing else and would have been happy.  We got a couple pieces of the fried chicken -  thick, crunchy flavorful crust covering moist delicious chicken.  A winner!  And then of course the pizza - generous and fresh tasting toppings on an excellent crust, with all the right options.  The salads here are great, too. with good sized portions of fresh ingredients.  Get the family together and head over for a great meal!</review><user_id>107317692369704031700< /user_id><name>Denis DeFigueiredo</name><Gmap_id>0x80c2f67eb72809e5:0xc273867efb471123<//Gmap_id></record>

I plan on returning for some pizza and I will comment on that once I try it .it's nice to have a place to dine at locally without having to settle for the two fast food joints available . The staff was friendly and I came in when it was slow so I was able to ask a lot of questions and have undivided attention from the server my other gripe is they carry pepsi products as a fountain drink .I prefer coke but will settle for fresh ice tea.</review></record></dataset><record>

Loved the food here!  Tried it this weekend - the fried ravioli was my favorite along with the battered potato wedges.  So so good.  Chicken wings were yummy and then of course the pizza was great!  Crust had the perfect crisp to it and plenty of toppings!!<//review>

The new owners made some changes and not to my liking. The spaghetti and meatballs recipe was ultimately changed for the worse. Marinara sauce was just a plain tomato paste sauce. Meatballs were very bland and unseasoned with just onions in the meatballs. Very disgusting. This was the only place in Acton that had some quality quantity food. Will never eat here again.< /review>

< Review>
Terrible service. Management is rude. Food is below average but the pizza is good. They were inundated when my order came in but when it's burned they will not make it right. Very bad service.... Russ who says he is the owner, 27 years, act's fresh out of high school & after hanging up on me 3 times, portrayed that customer service is not valuable in his business. He came to pick up the burnt pizza & looked at it then proceeded to pick the burnt pieces off the food and I quote he said "That's what "my" people should have done before it came to you" right in fornt of me and someone from property security! Wonder what they put in my food I'm going to eat... hopefully no one's fingers! You have been warned! The "Dudes" need to grow up! Btw his 30 pizza order from a production company, prioritized his under laiden arrogance & I fell throught the cracks. Hmm... could of been a whole nother experience but his relative was working the phones and elevated the negitive experience & with a follow up knocking on the wrong door disturbing strangers amplified an already bad experience. A simple phone call to verify the apt# would of sufficed... it is the 21st century RIGHT! Humph... yes I don't feel comfortable eating at this place. You're Lucky Russ, I didn't report the experience to the health department. Coachable moment here.<//Review>

Random stop for pizza. 2 large pizzas for nearly $40. Not great flavor and way overpriced. Too expensive for just okay pizza. Maybe a fluke, came on a bad day or something? Three stars for a very nice interior, might be a good place to watch a game and have a beer</text>

I stumbled upon this place by accident and I am glad I did. Excellent pizza, the chicken is really really tasty and they have this tobasco sauce that I can't seem to find anywhere, except there. I love their cheesy garlic bread and they have outstanding customer service. THEY DELIVER!!! CALL THEM TODAY AND TRY IT FOR YOURSELF. AMAZING!!!< /review>

Stumbled upon this place by accident. Sat down to eat and felt like we were back in the 80's because of the decor when we got our food we were pleasantly surprised. It was deliciously auathentic. The pizza had great flavor by far one of the best I've had the dudes there were super friendly as well so all in all wonderful experience< /text>

Delicious pizza and pasta as well as broasted chicken that is a must try! The potato wedges are also a favorite.

The best place to go for pizza in Acton!< /Text>

<text>The Pizza Place is a small, family owned pizza shop in the heart of Acton. Its a hole in the wall place where you can expect real handmade pizza. Delicious food and a cool tropical inspired dining room welcome you. If you’re in the Acton/ Agua Dulce area looking for a bite to eat the Pizza Place is the choice for you.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I personally did not attend, my friend did. Here is his experience.

"After a long trip to my home town in the middle of the desert, the Pizza Place is always there to greet me with those roasted zucchini and a big plate of pizza. Lots of animals and decor. One of my favorite places, if nothing else out of nostalgia."< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2f67eb72809e5:0xc273867efb471123< /Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>We went here recently because we needed to pluck up food to go in Acton and there didn't seem to be a lot of choices.  The restaurant  seemed to be split in two.  Half was under construction and the offer resembled a deserted tiki bar. In the middle is a small area where we ordered.  The pizza was adequate, though the crust was a bit soggy and the sauce didn't have much flavor. For what we got, the prices seemed a bit on the high side. Not the best, not the worst.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1512668669355, 'text': 'Hello SJ.  Im sorry for the construction noise. We are completing some major renovations to update the store. We now have a beautiful Sports Bar with 6 TVS— the big one is 85”.

(Translated by Google) It seems like it was an unexpected restaurant. It's a pizza place that I didn't know on my way to Las Vegas. The local feel was the Western American feel that I only saw on TV, and it was nice to be able to choose the toppings for the pizza and set the size of each slice. boss? employee? Feeling the purity of the same person, a feeling that tourists cannot find? The owner, who is unfamiliar with tourists, seems to be more cute and attractive to us. I'll never forget the moment I ate the pizza right out of the car. The dough was crispy, not salty and so delicious!! I was so happy to taste the unforgettable pizza I felt locally. The pizza box was so cute as in the photo and I can't forget the taste. It’s not a chain, it’s a shame

뜻밖의 맛집이였던거 같음 , 라스베이거스로 가는 길에 모르고 들린 피자집인데 완전 맛있어요. 현지느낌 물씬풍기는 티비에서만 보던 그런 미국서부느낌였고, 피자는 토핑을 선택할 수 있고 슬라이스 조각별로 사이즈 정할 수 있어서 좋았어요. 사장님? 직원? 같은분의 순수함을 느꼈음, 관광객이 찿지않는 그런 느낌? 관광객을 낯설어 하는 주인이 오히려 더 귀엽고 우리에게 매력을 준거 같음. 바로 나온 피자를 차에서 먹었던 그 순간을 잊지 못할 거 같아요 도우는 바삭하고 짜지않고 너무 맛났어요!! 미굳 현지에서 느낀 잊지못할 피자를 맛보게 되어 너무 행복했었습니다. 피자상자도 사진처럼 넘 귀여웠고 그 맛을 잊을수가 없네요. 체인도 아니라 다시 갈수 없는 현실이 너무 아쉽네요</Text>

I spent a lot of time shopping for the right bike, and I didn't find it until I found the right people; those who really cared and knew their stuff.

< Review>
I dropped into the shop in the middle of a virtual race I was trying complete. I had overinflated my rear tire and blew it out at the end of a ride. I didn't have a spare tube.  My wheels require a very long stem and there is a shortage.

Lisa was so kind to her spare tube from her bike bag and give it to me. They quickly installed it and I was on my way. PureRide always goes the extra mile to make sure we are happy.</Review>

Tim helped me find a great bike that fit me, my needs and my budget which is no easy task given the bicycle drought the pandemic has caused. I love my new ride!</review>

Great bike shop! Went in there over the weekend to buy a new bike. They were so helpful and knowledgeable, and their prices are good too. So happy to be able to frequent a local business. And who can beat the free lifetime tuneups???</review>

Fixed my flat in 5 min., they closed in 10 minutes. And they're a few weeks backed up for service orders. Very nice of them! Much appreciated</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Craig was extremely helpful, courteous, and kind. He made sure to match me with the price I saw on their website and ensured the bike was ready to go and I understood all the functions and care regarding it. All the other staff were also helpful and the store had a great atmosphere. You can tell they care for their customers.

I plan on getting my bike tuned here exclusively and making any future bike purchases through Pure Ride Cycles. Do not have any hesitations coming here.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1587409312715</Date><user_name>Mr R</user_name>< user>

I originally I ordered a Giant Stance 29er, came to pick it up and it had 27 inch wheels on it. No one to blame, it was a misunderstanding. Kristin the owner was immediately on the phone to try to find me a 29er. After test riding the one that she had ready for me, she said she found one but it was a different color. Kristin went out of her way to pick up the one she found at another shop, located in a completely different city, and had it built for me to pick up the following day. I ride 3-4 times a week and loving the bike. Kristen, Lisa and their staff are amazing, they truly care about their customers. They're all very knowledgeable of their products and they really take the time to get to know their customers to help them make the right decision on purchasing a bike. Pure Ride has won a lifelong customer.<//Text>

<review>I was riding on the Aliso Creek trail yesterday and got a flat tire. I called Pure Ride from an internet search right before they were closing to tell them my situation. They waited for me to walk my bike over there so they could fix my flat tire for me and save my day. Total life savers! I would have had to walk home 5 miles with my broken bike but the owner Kristen and her staff Lisa were kind enough to do this for me. Shout out to them and Pure Ride Cycles for being such amazing people and giving such great customer service. I recommend anyone to take their bikes here to get the same great experience I had.</review>< userid>

<review>This was the best experience I could possibly ask for. If you’re looking for a bike shop that operates with the highest level of integrity and customer service this is the one. Sales approach was very low pressure and was centered around my needs. The expertise in picking out a bike that was right for me and getting it fitted (you’re crazy if you don’t have your bike fitted for you) was the best I’ve ever experienced.  I felt like I was going back in time the way customer service was meant to be at a sincere personal level. I had a chance to meet the owner and it was obvious why the bike shop operates the way it does.<//review>< Pictures>

Brought my kids bike in for a flat and my wife’s bike for a chain. Waited a week and a half to get the bikes back.  The new tire lasted less then a week of riding around the neighborhood on residential streets.
Repeatedly tried calling the number and no one picks up or it’s constantly busy.
Find another bike shop!!!</Review>

Do check out their cycling classes and group rides. Fun people.

Look for me out on the road or trails in my Pure Ride Cycles kit. On the trails you'll see me on my Trek Top Fuel 9.8. Amazing bike!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dce8f93803e5b5:0x5b6618e5a92076a0< /Gmap_id>< Response>

Just ordered my 3rd bike from Pure Ride in the last few years. Kristen and the crew always knowledgeable and eager to make sure I get the best set up possible. Beyond that, the prices I have paid are always competitive with any web based. The expert service is what makes this shop a favorite.<//text>

< Review>
My girlfriend and I were in the market for mountain bikes. We did a lot of research on local bike stores, selection, etc. and had decided to try out Pure Ride Cycles.

I had actually come to this place back in the 90s and bought a bike! This place is AWESOME! Clean and organized store, large selection, competitive pricing (Smokin' deals!), and most important, SUPERB service!

We had the pleasure of working with Shawn, Trevor and Kristen. They were very knowledgeable, friendly, and made us feel welcomed. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get into or get back into biking! We'll definitely be coming back. Thank you Pure Ride Cycles, you guys ROCK! #NEWBIKEDAY< /Review>

I called to check if they can fix my bike, and a friendly man replied yes. I came in about an hour before closing, and was told it would be ready in a day or so. It was understandable because they were busy. However, the bike mechanic heard I only needed brakes adjusted and happily took the time to fix my bike at that moment. It was ready in a short time, and the price was great. I recommend everyone to come here; to buy a bike or even to have a bike fixed. Thank you Greg and the bike mechanic for your help!</Text>

The staff was very nice. We took a bike in to check if the tires were okay, and Kristen was very nice and--in addition to checking the tires--checked to see if anything else was amiss with the bike. She also talked about clinics and classes running from the store so that was really helpful.</Text>

From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted with courtesy and professionalism.  All my questions, no matter how trivial were fully answered.  I bought a new bike that had to be ordered and Kristen called to keep me up to date on its arrival. I picked it up today and couldn't be happier with my purchase and with the time that the Pure Ride Cycle team took to educate me about my new ride.  They even installed my bike rack for me. Thank you to Kristen, Keiffer, and Craig for setting the bar high on customer service. You have made me a customer for life.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I went in to get some service done on my son's bike.  I also was purchasing a mountain bike.  This shop really is first class.  Both Kristen and Kiefer helped us and it's just how all bicycles business should operate.  Tremendous amount of knowledge and patience for all our questions.  The pricing was more than fair and they threw in some accessories. The bike fitting from Kristen was the most detailed i've ever seen.  They also have a line of bikes for all budgets.  The lower end/entry level to the highest end Carbon for the more experienced rider.  Really glad to have come here.</Text>

Called up to see if they carry reflectors. I got a ticket in HB for no reflectors (500 dollar ticket if you don't get it signed off) I had checked WalMart and Target and multiple bike shops. Noone carrys them. But this guy on the phone said come on down and he'll take care of me. Awesome. Thank you!</review>

<Text>It’s our first time to eat here at Korean Palace and we made the right choice .. the food was great and authentic.. the owner and servers were very nice and pleasant. They helped us picked the right combination for our BBQ experience. The soft tofu soup was great. We will definitely come back here with our friends! Thank you! Kamsahamnida😀<//Text>< time>

<text>We found another Korean gem 😋 I usually can’t eat bibimbap but this one was so delicious that I literally scooped out the half of it from hubby’s hot pot. I loved all side plates except kimchi, personally it tasted like a raw fish.
But we loved this place, people, interior and of course the food 🥘.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4eoqCnooOQM1XNPt5A43rw6ylYB5WrWGYpQpd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<text>All I can really say is wow. We stopped by while on a business trip just on a whim. We were pleasantly surprised since we went at 7 pm and the dining room was completely empty. However, their food was amazing! Maybe some clarification on their menus when trying to specify items between lunch and dinner options. But their food was great, service was lacking since they were all sitting and talking/headphones in/watching videos on phone.<//text><time>1538805418050<//time><userid>109269140219393563208</userid><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOM3vtFvF2VK9qhQX6Ds8FYXtdL2v8lJvLYz26y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg1xEGS6K_LiiVrRoreDtLh5NlbCUaogiMp4RV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Name>Anne Watkins< /Name><Gmap_id>0x808fcb3d2120f229:0xe58b7763bf3f5321< /Gmap_id>< rating>

Located in a run down area, but worth the quick drive from Valley Fair Mall, and once inside, a feast awaits you. Large booths, private party room. This restaurant has been around for a long time, once a palace feel, now some of the vinyl on the booths reveals its age and wear. Bulgogi is sweet and tender and addictive! A good deal on lunch. Quality food and freshly made typical Korean dishes. Overseen by the owners who are usually there, and same waiters and waitresses who do not seem to age. Recent visit revealed new seat cushions! The cooks are Korean ladies, the food shows so much attention to details that adds more taste to each dish. This restaurant is incredibly good!< /Text>

<Review>Seafood Soon Tofu was quite spicy but delicious. Recommended to go for lower spice level if you don't have high spice tolerance. Large side dish portions. Service was not very fast but the server was very meticulous and accommodating in explaining ingredients in food according to a friend's dietary restrictions. Overall would recommend this place.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5I0mB_vyZaDf8vtqjfPNPDogInEHWPXMwj_53=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEPL4B0woI21l-4EashWbXyTHEpsiD3v_2BtOh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I like this restaurant! They serve sensational meals, they have a rich menu, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are consistently good, the attitude towards the clients  is very good too. I often eat in this place and I was never disappointed.  I highly recommend it.<//review>

Korean food and the feeling at this place is great. Entered near ten, it was not crowded. The bill won't shock you. Food is similar to a cafe in Portland I liked.< /Text>

<text>I was part of a large group (around 20 people) that came in on relatively short notice and the entire experience was wonderful. The food was great and the restaurant was clean but by far the most impressive was the quality of service. They were incredibly accommodating to us and just absolutely wonderful to work with. This was originally our second option because the original place we were going to was too crowded, but it ended up being the best decision of our night. Thanks for everything, Korean Palace staff!</text>< Pictures>

I am Korean and this is not real Korean food. Almost every dish is under seasoned and prepared improperly. I am an amateur cook at home and I know for certain I can prepare much better Korean meals than this knock-off. Don't waste your money in this overpriced fraud.</text>

Great, authentic Korean food. Been eating there with my family for years. My mom is full Korean (born in Korea) and this is pretty much the only Korean food she'll eat in the Bay area.</Review>

This place is fantastic. We were actually going to go to the other Korean BBQ place down the road, but they were closed. I had earlier suggested we stop by Korean palace but my friend was insistent that we go to the other place. Once we saw they were closed we made our way back to the palace and sat down for lunch. All I can say is wow! The food is fantastic and the prices were more than reasonable for what we got. If you like Korean BBQ, definitely check this place out!< /text>

Had a after funeral meal here couple days ago - probably had 50 people there and we had the reservation set couple days prior to the date. When we arrived there was only 1 server ready to serve all 50 people which started the whole chaos of: food tasting horrible, not providing the enough side dishes, food becoming cold, not providing rice for 20 minutes after food came out, not having water, food coming out super late (took more than 30 minutes for a Galbitang, which usually takes less than 10 minutes), server sighs every time we even try to ask for a small favor (such as to bring salt and pepper to the table) and so many other 100 issues that I can’t even list all here. The owner must have thought that he would make a lot of money by cutting cost of having more servers to serve 50 people; and i guess it worked out as he planned. But I do not think anyone who was there on that day are willing to go back there and about 40 of 50 people that were there were from the local area and we couldnt be more terrified on how they treated us. I think the experience from here was one of the worst services and food that I have had for my whole entire life. Thanks to the owner of this restaurant, Korean Palace, for the experience and letting me appreciate the services from other restaurants. Not going back ever. Bye</Text>

The decor and sign may be dated, but this is some of the most reliably good Korean food in town. Try the table grilled meats, the stone pot specialties and enjoy endlessly replenished sides of vegetables,  kimchee, tofu and other yummy things. No frills, just good comfort food.</Review>

The quality of the food is good and the staff are  very friendly. The reason I would not give this place 5 stars is because of the amount of food given and the fam that that there are only certain items on the menu that allow you to use the table top grill. Also, it is quite pricey for the amount. My wife and I paid $60 for a combination plate that comes with 4 types of meats. Most Korean BBQ places have a flat rate and it's all you can eat....not here. All in all, it is a nice little restaurant but I will no be frequenting it.</review>

<Text>The food is fresh and melts in your mouth! The owner and staff are very pleasant and accommodating. Not the place to go if you're in a hurry,  but great to unwind and savor flavors.  Family atmosphere.  Reasonable prices. Room in the back for private parties. Not a lot of parking.< /Text><gmapID>0x808fcb3d2120f229:0xe58b7763bf3f5321</gmapID><Date>1479907667148</Date>< user_name>

Great food and great service. Been coming here since I was 14yrs. Old and am 37yrs. Old now and bringing my loved ones here for a long time. It's our favorite Korean place to eat. The owners have been the same and the food just keeps getting better! A definite must for Korean foodies.<//Text>

<text>Our go to Korean Restaurant. Service is great. We really like the food but we're not Korean... It's usually pretty quiet there as well. Favorite dishes include the raw crab in garlic chili sauce, bi bim bap (beef), and the seafood pancake.<//text>< pics>

An old Korean restaurant has to compete with newer ones so if you can't beat fresh new fusion by price, decor, or service then you'll be in trouble.

The problem with this is the event is run inefficient and poorly.  Normally places charge by the person but here they charge by plate used. Really odd considering guest don't know that so some guest grab two plates or a new plate for seconds.

The portions provided do not come close to estimates and they always run short on the meats.

DIY. Bad business practice and skimps on meats for events.</Review>

<Review>Kalbi, dak kalbi, and beef tang soo yook (Korean BBQ and sweet and sour beef) were really good even though they were precooked and it was a buffet. Great place to host events but parking was lacking when we went on a Saturday.</Review>< pics>

Attended event there.  Good authentic stuff.  Kimchee tasted homemade.  Overall very satisfied with meal and service.  Looks like restaurant could use a refresh but if it's for people looking for authentic stuff then sometimes looks don't matter.  ;)<//Text>

Wasn't one of better Korean places in the valley. Service was poor, looked family run without employees. Lunch special had less portions and the bul gogi steak that the attender said was their most popular dish. But wasn't tasting like typical Korean bbq<//text>

Stopped by on our way through town. Our server was super friendly and attentive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I grew up with Korean grandmothers and everything tasted exactly the way they cook. The Tofu Jigae and bulgoki were so good!  The side dishes were great too! Great family restaurant!</Text>

As others have mentioned, our group was rushed with impunity from the moment we entered the near-empty establishment.  Our waitress, becoming upset that we did not order immediately as we sat down tapped her watch and told us to hurry.  She then left and did not come back for nearly 20 minutes.  The prices were twice the norm for the area, and the food quality was merely average.  When the check was presented, the waitress stood impatiently by the table tapping her foot.  I will never visit this establishment again.<//Review>

The waitresses were great same with the host. The owner on the other hand is disgusting. She talked crap about me and my mom when we ordered 2 dishes that were inconvinient to make in Korean. Problem is we're Korean as well. So my mom asked if we shoukd change our order and she was surprised. Then she started talking about her kid's diaper issues very loudly and wouldn't shut her mouth the whole time. Should have walked out then but we were too hungry. she talked the whole time very loudly and had the nerve to ask how our food was. Very very disturbed. Lost my appetite and barely touched the food. It was poorly prepared and watery anyways. And there was no one in the restaurant so no need to rush.</text>

(Translated by Google) Overall the food tastes good.
The boss is so kind and kind.

Bachelor kimchi, which is served mainly by regular customers, is really art. I want to be a regular, but it's like a chimney.

The sincerity to enter bachelor kimchi is wonderful.

Unfortunately, the amount is not enough.
Properly adjusted, you can enjoy your meal.

전체적으로 음식이 맛이 좋습니다.
사장님이 너무 인자하시고 친절하세요

단골 손님 위주로 내놓으시는 총각김치는 정말 예술입니다. 단골 되고싶은 마음이 굴뚝같은데 워낙 멀어서 아쉽네요

총각김치에 들어가는 정성이 대단합니다.

아쉽다면 양이 조금 부족한편입니다.
적절하게 조절하시면 즐겁게 식사 하실 수 있습니다.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It's a Korean-style house that looks like a royal family event. It is a delicious dish such as ribs, sashimi, kimchi and so on. But the mess room is a little old.

<Text>(Translated by Google) About 50 people went to a group and one server. Galbi-tang was so unsuitable that he asked for salt, but because there was only one server, he didn't have time to salt it. Just drink the minced ribs. Dumplings are frozen dumplings. The owner is rotten.

<user_name>Luke Schmidt< /user_name><Date>1618098165006< /Date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Mediterranean food is good, but for me it's never been anything special. Food is special when it makes me feel special. I feel special when my food makes me feel like it's only us left on this Earth. When everything else in the background fades and the only thing clear in my life is my food, that's special. That's why I don't like eating out with people, especially if we're going to a nice place. Anyways, when my friends and I got food from SAJJ I didn't think I was going to have any trouble eating with them...how wrong I was. I semi wanted to leave the conversation we were having so I could go eat my food alone in another room. I wanted to give this falafel bowl the full attention that it deserved. I'm usually not that crazy over Mediterranean food, but SAJJ makes me feel special.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>This is my first visit. I stopped in for lunch after a visit to petsmart. I ordered the chicken shawarma. The service was great and friendly. They offer a rice bowl, salad bowl, wrap or pita. I chose the salad bowl. The seasoning was great and the ingredients were fresh.

I’ll be back.< /Text>< Pics>

I appreciated the young gentleman who made the most delectable bowls for me! All the ingredients were tastefully placed and even his questions showed that he put a lot of effort into his work. Great customer service, great quality and freshness! Plus they included lentil soup and offered to put certain ingredients on the side that I wasn’t sure the other diners would like.</text>

Terrible experience. Ordered and paid for food that never got delivered. Food was delivered with out the main course and free item per easter promo code. 4 people had to share the tiny side dish which was the only meat item that got delivered.< /text>

Quick service Mediterranean restaurant located in a strip mall. Parking is generally not a problem. Staff is very friendly. Most of the menu is gluten free and peanut free.</text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Being a vegetarian in silicon Valley is a bit hard.
But I keep looking for good places to eat out every once in a while.
Sajj Mediterranean gave me a great eat out place this week.

Though there are plenty of meat options available, falafal and hummus keeps you happy.
We ordered falafal in Pita and hummus, veggies, etc.
Also a rice bowl with all the toppings and guac.
They serve the plates with their home made lentils soup. (which is warm and yum)

Food was delicious. The ambience is good too.
The kitchen is spotlessly clean.
The quantity is filling.

Must visit if you're looking for a great Mediterranean eats.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNjcWxX4HBpe2_vzXvIap-VZeGWx6TJpcZ6P3b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcrAYoEaEEDZvC-wSMYD2uStW3G9Vt4FLYW1cJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpesx9WrZH8XvB8XN-Mo9SV0Ba2wsK_TdhdIMz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNKM1LBtPfTm-0emHQrkLj19OHa50Q8KhCOKPc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMozoM-82Ra2mt2op4kfEyEeTOVNLu216e0TTxP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYQypYML7JVItUoE8yAlPygrMjW2OYitvLCKUb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY03tQF-dg4BMppQqwzd57XvsKRC_jtFG2u1Si=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdm9ZJCFcueH8reRxImESRXa_eaZYW7n772snk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

We arrived at this place for dinner. we heard about this spot from a lot of people.  Well, it was very successful. The crew were extremely nice and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We enjoyed every moment and we will definitely return to this restaurant. Keep it up.< /review>

It's Mediterranean food served Chipotle style. The customer service here is on point 🔥 you get free lentil soup with your bowl.

I had the pomegranate chicken and it was delicious! I also enjoyed the garlic spread and the cauliflower. I was recommended the mint chutney and it did not disappoint. Good size portion as well!</text>

Do not DoorDash from this location. Our salad bowls were barely half full. The bag of pita chips was only a handful. Skimped on all ingredients and left out some ingredients. I love Sajj, but will take my business to a different location that doesn’t rip off DoorDash customers.<//Review>

I've been twice and loved it and so did everyone that went with me. Vegan options heaven and options for animal eaters as well. Tons and tons of flavor. I wouldn't say this is for big groups, the most you can fit at a table is 5 people.</text>

I was drawn in by the sample falafel, very tasty.  The service was quick and friendly and the food was fresh and good.  Ordering is like a Mediterranean version of Chipotle.<//review>

Great little hands-on museum for younger children. Lots of hands-on activities including a kid sized grocery store and kitchen. A nursery area features lifelike dollies. A flowing flume and water table for exploring water. A Tot Spot allow under 3 visitor their own place to explore. Puzzles, a puppet theater and lots of interesting things to explore and learn. No screens or computers. Great place for parents and grand parents to have fun together.< /text>

Great for 3-7 age range. I often find exhibits are in need of repair, but nice pretend play areas including grocery store and home areas. Neat science for the littles. Nice staff.<//text>

This is a great place to take kids. Every activity provides an opportunity for children to explore and engage their brains and their bodies. The activities are hands on and easy to learn how to do. There is an awesome pretend play area with a grocery store area and a kitchen area. There is a book nook, easy access to family restrooms, and friendly staff. I would say Redwood Discovery Museum is geared toward kids younger than 10, but teens and adults can also enjoy trying out many of the activities. This is an ideal place to hang out on rainy and cold days when you can't take tge kids to the park. The museum often hosts free play groups, which is a great way to try it out for free. But the play group is very popular, so the museum can get crowded. It is well worth the cost of admission (or a membership) to visit when there isn't crowd. A tip for those who are easily over-stimulated by noise: take ear plugs, especially if you are going during a time when there are lots of other visitors.</Text>

Love Tuesday morning play group. People who work there are super nice and fun. Play is more targeted for 1.5 years old and up, but babies have fun crawling around too<//Review>

<review>This place is fun for my son who is 5, but is definitely geared towards babies. There's certain things for older kids that my son enjoys, and I see older kids checking out. Staff try to rotate and bring new stuff out, it just doesn't compare with other city's discovery museums, especially for the membership price. We come here during the school year/rainy season. They desperately need to fundraise more to afford some expansion. They are doing good with what they have though. The grocery area is a hot spot and the water play areas. We also enjoy the puppets and anything musical.<//review></record>

It's very small, so bigger boys could be dissappointed, but it's fabulous for girls, cause baby dolls appartment is amazing. Heavy big 'babies', so like real, nursing pillow, changing table, bottles, clothes, cangaroo,, bed, high chairs, paradise for girls.<//Text>

Too expensive, my grandkids were here visiting they are 9 and 13, they wanted me to pay for myself also at $5.00 each, mind you we've been to multiple museums already and we did not have any problems with the others😑😥<//text>

The store is well kept and clean.  They offer a lot of items that you would need in a pinch, especially since the nearest store from there is 30 miles.  However, the mark-up is savage ($6+ for a 24 slice pack of American cheese).<//text>

Good for what you need, nowhere even comparable to the down to earth, homegrown, country store it was in its original glory. It's more of a business than a family store.< /text>

I've been once and it was fine, the reason that I'm giving it only three stars is because the website says it's open till 12 am and my pregnant wife wanted french fries at 11:20 pm I googled what was open and she was very excited to get some Burger King only it was not open the website lied we drove over in such excitement only to be sadly disappointed. Don't send me a apology that you will look into it Burger King. I don't want apologies I want results. And also Don't think we won't be back because we'll definitely be back!<//text>

It was the worst dining experience ever! Our food was cold, there was a long hair found in my daughter's chicken nugget bag, and my son asked for no pickles and they put extra pickles on.  And they weren't even busy! Will never go to Burger King again.<//review>

<text>Ordered the impossible burgers, no mayo, no ketchup, side of well done fries and Dr pepper for my drink.
What I got instead was an impossible burgers drownin in mayo, soggy fries and a diet Pepsi.
Pointed this out to the woman working the drive thru window and she tried to tell me I got exactly what I ordered.
Eventually got a new bun out of her and considered the rest a loss. 👎🏻</text><resp>None<//resp>< time>

Service was quick, but my order of mac n cheetos was burned and dried out; they looked and tasted like they had been sitting out all day. Dining area was fairly clean and staff were friendly, so I still give it three stars.</text>

The service there tends to be a little slower than most fast food places. The food is always good, but it seems like they're short staffed.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Burger King from the Vandenberg area base in Lompoc Ca. It is a fantastic experience where my coworkers and I have breakfast every day, Rosa, Sara, Martina and Hong are like family they already know what we order and if we do not eat well they worry because they know that our work requires a good breakfast. Thank you for having such a nice staff that makes us feel at home.

Gracias por tener un personal tan lindo que nos hace sentir como en casa .< /Text>

I will no longer be a customer and that place will go downhill from now on. Oh well I guess time to try Forbus or Rod´s.<//Text>< Pics>

I have been in 2 times and had the same stylist, I believe her name is Jessica and she is outstanding.  I know there are 2 Jessica’s that work there but she was working yesterday cutting hair because the other 3 were doing color.  She is very personable and loves to talk while cutting hair.  You are blessed to have her in your employment<//Text>

Best HAIR SALON in town. They are staffed for walkins all day, and prices are still pretty low in a world where everything is super expensive.</Text>

Nearly impossible to find on a map. Very dirty but that can be fixed. No trashcans anywhere near by.
There is a heavy barrel in one of the bowls, which makes that bowl unusable.
This could be a really nice park but needs some work.</review>

<Review>Wish the city would put more money into it the kids really use it. All the kids come together when it comes to helping one another there. If someone falls they help even if they don't know them.< /Review>< user_name>

It's a skatepark, but I don't think the person who designed it  was a skateboarder or roller blader. Obstacles either are to small, to big or badly placed with horrible transitions.

Theres no shade,  lights, drinking fountains or restrooms either.</Review>

Always a well organized store. I enjoy shopping it because it's so well cared for. If I go into a store and it's tore up from the floor up. I find myself facing so I don't like to shop a store if I have to work to hard it's not relaxing. They must have good management to look that good.<//Review>

<time>1613320761674<//time><rating>5<//rating><text>I came here today to get a few things for my sister , son, and a friend that are spending valentines day.  Today was hard it will be the first year without my 15 yr old daughter that recently passed away in December so I got a balloon for my daughter so we can release it today with messages for her and it needed more air so the lady was nice to have someone put air in it for me. Although it did accidentally pop they did offer me another balloon and were really sympathetic to me. It's hard to hide feelings and not show emotions around others. Thank you for this I chose a cat for her as it was also her favorite animal<//text>< Pictures>

Prices aren't always the best deals in town, and I have gotten sick after eating the fresh prepared food here more than once.  Atmosphere is great and there's a great selection of inventory, so come here when you feel like spending a little more for a bit of specialty in your meals.</review>

Safeway is a very clean, well-stocked, grocery store, with very polite, professional employees. Some of the prices are a bit more expensive than other stores, however the convenience of being able to find items that other grocery stores don't carry, added to the deli delights, sandwich shop, Starbucks kiosk, and always having a great selection of gorgeous flowers, makes paying a little more understandable.<//Text>

Very clean store, a regular for me. The Deli is exceptional. Prices are fairly high, however if you sign up for "Just 4 You" (no charge) and take advantage of the membership deals and coupons as well as rewards, you will find some great prices.<//Text>

<Review>For the most part they're always able to fill my order as I requested. I'm sure they're busy but it would be kind of nice if they would call about some items but they don't give you a option when checking out to send them a message or whatever anyway but I like Safeway and pick up is usually pretty good and delivery that's why I gave it a 4-star because they've lost my order a couple of times<//Review><user>110934515414795093387<//user>< Gmap_id>

I ordered a cake from the bakery with fresh strawberries and whip cream. When it was time to cut the cake the inside had strawberry jam. I was so disappointed. To top it off the bakery staff was so rude. I will not be ordering another cake< /review>

<text>Always convenient, this one has a gas station and a big store. I'm a regular Safeway shopper, both at home and on the road as in this case. Since it has a fuel station I plugged it into my phone and this was my stop on a 10 hour drive. I live in Lake Tahoe and was on my way to Los Angeles and beyond. Safeway is the only place I shop. We only have 3 markets in South Lake Tahoe, 2 Safeways and a Rayleys market. Its the better deal, I can rack up the rewards and use them for gas or groceries.< /text>< Response>

I was looking for glycerin and had a hard time finding it they asked me for what kind of use I  need it for it has different forms and finally one associate said we don't carry liquid form of glycerin for skin care. I only knew glycerin is a liquid for repairing / softening dry skin.
that's  why I prefer online shopping over  moving between stores in search of a common item.</Text>

I came here looking for something specific that I thought they'd have and they didn't unfortunately, but they did have everything else i needed and more. Lots of fresh produce to get your meal going.  Wide variety of meats to cook up.  Many breads to choose from and Apparently there cakes are good because there wasn't much to pick from.  Clean store<//text>

<text>Safeway was very safe.  Ha ha.  I hadn't been in for a while,  so the one way signs on the floor and the change in location of a few things threw me.  Still,  I bought a fridge and pantry's worth of food for under $300 and my checker was funny.  So win win!<//text>< pictures>

Honestly not impressed.  Overheard manager complaining about things not getting done in the store.  The shelf stockers didn't even leave enough room to get my cart through in some places.  Just staff not very concerned with how you will get an item if it means their job is easier.  Definitely was impressed with the produce section though.  The cashier was friendly.  Overall I would prefer a different store if it wasn't near by.<//text>

I went to pick up my daughter's graduation cake today and it was absolutely the UGLIEST CAKE I've even seen! I was so disappointed, I even told the girl who handed me the cake and she could care less. I actually ordered the cake a week in advance so was completely surprised at how awful it looked! I had to go to Party City to purchase a cake topper because I was embarrassed to serve it to my daughter and her guests for their graduation!<//text>

I have always received excellent customer service at Safeway. They are always happy to help and I never have to look very far for an employee when I need help! I really appreciate their fresh fruits and veggies and variety of organic products, gluten free products and fresh seafood and meats!<//review>

This store always has friendly staff and is always clean, I never have any complaints. Today on the otherhand, two staff members who are young men asked the person in charge if they could drink water and she refused. Many people heard the interaction and it left a bad inpression. She could have been nicer and let the boys drink water. I like two spend my money at stores that treat staff with respect. This happened around 6:20pm.< /Text>

The best customer service I've ever received! We ordered 3 cakes for our company and they didn't turn out the first time but the manager Olivia and the cake decorator Bianca helped us out so much! They made better cakes then I could've imagined! They came out so wonderful!!! Olivia and Bianca were so kind and helpful, this was such an amazing experience!!! I'd wholeheartedly recommend going to the bakery for any of your cake needs, they'll make your cake dreams come true!</review>

<text>🤨The checkout lines are long. Only 2 open + self-checkout, where you can't buy alcohol.🍷  And we all need alcohol, lol, so the 2 check out lines were long and slow. It may be that cashiers don't want to put themselves in danger of COVID and aren't working. (cashier told me they don't have enough staff) ❗If so they should have someone checking ID's at self check out. Then the person with three items incl. alcohol doesn't have to be in the line behind a shopper with a cart Full.< /text></record>

If you don't mind paying a little more and wanna get a Starbucks at the same time its still a good store.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>They have a really good bakery with fantastic donuts.  Lots of other goodies as well.  I also like their produce section.  They have good sales but otherwise, prices are a little high.  However their gas prices can only be beat by Costco.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Lines are usually not bad.  Can also get a great cup of coffee and free Wi-Fi.  They offer a seating area in order to enjoy these amenities and seems popular with the college kids. All in all, it's a store I go to about once a month and I recommend it anyone who hasn't tried them out.  Side note, they have a Fed ex pick up once a day and a cash center that offers lots of extras.< /Review>< Rate>

It is January, but it was still warmer outside than in the store. And the lines to check out are always long. So bundle up and bring your patience if you choose to shop here.<//review>< response>

Stay away from the cut-up fruit. First of all it is priced way too high and then when you get it home you find it's not even ripe. I bought a small container of cantalope (hard as a rock) and a larger container of watermelon no sweetness whatsoever. I have bought fruit like this for several years with some hits and misses, guess it just got to me this time. I will no longer buy these items from this store again< /Review>

<Text>I have been a long term customer of this store and have always had a good experience. They carry pretty much anything you can think of. This review is mainly for their new grocery delivery system, which is amazing! I  was able to get the just for U coupons and discounts just like in the store. I scheduled a time three days in advance, but it can be a same day delivery. My order was delivered perfectly on time with all the items I ordered to perfection!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I live in Manteca and work in Turlock..so when I exited the freeway to run in for half-n-half I was unsure if I would be able to get back on the freeway with out a hassle. But sure enough I was in and out with some awesome organic creamer and BLAMMO! Right back on my way, No glitches. Great way to start the day!<//text>

I love the selections for dairy free here. Many more choices than other markets in Turlock. Since I'm new gluten free I should add the bread selection is better here also. Great produce and meat selections. Clean store<//text>

< Review>
Safeway has good prices when items are on sale and I use my Safeway card. Most regular price items that I bought were expensive. The store was clean and well organized.  Staff was very helpful and pleasant.<//Review>

I have always been a Safeway shopper. For the most part the employees are friendly and helpful. But! the deli manager and some of the workers usually are annoyed that you want to make a purchase. Too bad because the deli has some good offerings.< /text>

Sometimes when I walk in I feel judged by people because I feel out of place. I'm Latino and this is Turlock after all, but regardless the staff are friendly most of the time and the selection is amazing. Especially the clearance section. I go straight there Everytime because college is expensive lol. But regardless, I like coming here every now and then.</Review>

I really like this Safeway, but they need to make the self checkout machines quicker. This is the 21st century and were almost 20 years in, we shouldn't have to answer redundant questions and take forever. Overall great store though.<//text>

Always a very clean and nice grocery store. Best part is that it is 24/7, so you can go there any time of night in case you are in an emergency for something.
Staff is always friendly and very helpful, also having a Safeway card will save you tons of money in groceries, and contributes to lower gas prices with their gasoline pumps. It's highly recommended to get one if you're an avid Safeway shopper. Overall, great place.</Text>

Great store, clean, beautiful produce, and hands down the best Pharmacy. The  Pharmacists care for your well-being and will help explain medications calmly, they are never rushing you to get to the next customer. Highly recommend!<//Text>

<user>108997379031500390635<//user><text>This store was a favorite of mine. I could get all the items l was used to all over the state. Sometimes it is hard to find non dairy ice cream with no regular sugar. It is also hard to find items with no meat,  but I could always count on finding those great healthy items there. I felt safe in my purchases. I am a stickler for excellent customer service, and their's was excellent.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I waited at the deli for service. I was the only person there.  I picked up prepackage muffins at the bakery and they all fell out  into the cart. I was informed that one has to use both hands because they are not tightly sealed. Gluten free almond muffins were covered with mold.</Review>

One of the nicest shopping experiences in Turlock.  the prices are a bit higher than the discount grocery stores, however, if you look for things on sale you can actually get them cheaper than Walmart or food Maxx.<//text>

Sandwich was as dry as the  personalities...
But the sandwich was premade.. just like the judgements..lol

Employees and other customers... Just look and act so Drab. Half are socially inept & the Rest.. have some kinda ELITIST stuffy "the whole world is peasents... don't breathe on my wine bottles - Kraft singles.. you heathens"  BUT IN THE DEFENSE OF ALL. THATS JUST HOW IT IS. a divided world. Ignorant and indifferent.  I'll be damned if a cashier's is just gonna stare at me. Like I'm a Martian cause I gave him a dollar in quarters.. or paid with cash & card. 😂 Or cause I got on 4 wire wrapped stones / Crystals cracking jokes< /review>

< Review>
Love using the App, saving gas, and coupons that are just for me in the App as well. The store is really nice and I go in the morning usually and the lines aren't long and the people are nice. The only frustrating thing is if I have to go in the afternoon or evening it is busy and there are only about 2 cashiers so it takes a while to check out. Otherwise it is really nice< /Review>

They don't know how to listen to a directions was the worst shopping experience I've had the should get some training on maybe clearing their ears I'm sure they sell q-tips and they should clean their ears so they can hear what someone is telling them</Review>

Safeway has the worst positioning of their carts. No carts inside for their customers. Being handicapped,  having to walk back outside to search for a shopping cart and then walk back in to shop is inconvenient.< /Review>

<Text>Love Safeway. I can always find something new to try there like Tea for example, or a new juice. They always have something you can't find at the other stores. Sure you're going to pay a little more for it but it is worth it.< /Text>< UserId.>

Everytime I come here I tell myself I will never come back but this time I really mean it.  The customer service is terrible!  Especially the short, old, chubby guy with the beard in Produce...he is absolutely terrible!!! The whole staff, overall, act like they can't be bothered & you're putting them out terribly if you ask a simple question. I will be loyal to Raleys from now on.  Their customer service is excellent!!</Text>

<text>You can get great deals on quality food products, provided you have a Club Card. However, whenever I am in this store, I experience horrible customer service. Maybe it is a coincidence that my visits may fall on customer service's "bad day". I've tried to avert this experience by going to self checkout.  That's a joke.  If you (the machine) ask me if I brought my own bag, and I enter yes, why do I gave to wait for customer service to come and scan their little security card key  ( apparently the same card used to access the bank vault..since only one person can carry it) ? This isn't a quick process, because the magic key holder is too busy helping the other guy out who scanned one too many bananas. By the time I'm done, I might as well stayed in the regular line. PS...the ice cream melted<//text>< pictures>

Went to the Turlock Ca. Store just to grab a few items... I grabbed some batteries a cell phone charger that was on discount and when I asked an employee where to find plastic silverware I realised she was following me around .. she followed me all the way to the plastic spoons waited for me to select some followed me back toward the front and I stopped to look for a cold drink and the female employee rudely tells me the registers are the other way as if I planned to walk out or something I set the items down because I'm pissed at this point n she rudely tells me to have a nice day as if she's now pleased I'm leaving. ....worst experience ever.</Text>

For paying such a high price, bad customer service. Most of the time there are few people in the line and only one or two cashiers are open. And when it’s quite there are no cashier. If I have to use the self pay machine to scan my items, I better pay half price. I have to scan and bag myself, then why even I am paying more than any other grocery store in Turlock. I have been shopping here for long time, but the service got really bad lately. Done shopping here. I will go somewhere that they respect there customers and not let them wait in the long line for 20 or more minutes, or Use there customers as a catchier.< /Text>

<review>Horrible service. There are always long lines. Never enough check stands open. The checkers are slow. Even the self checkout has half the kiosks out of service most of the time. Forget the stressful shopping experience here and go to a different grocery store.<//review>< name>

<Review>The man working at the Deli, Ryan, is very slow and has no sense of urgency even when he had a line of 5 people to help. We (2 people) were in line for at least 10 minutes as he made sandwiches as slowly as possible. A lady finally came to help, but she was slow too. Ryan got to us before she did, so then we waited several minutes while he looked for tortillas, only for the tortillas to be frozen & not able to thaw for a long while; we couldn't get what we asked for. Huge waste of time, and the guy was incompetent. Then this safeway was out of packs of scones "for the rest of the week" when I asked, and had no single person sized fresh fruit cups stocked. Further, their Starbucks didn't have a publicly accessible microwave to warm things up in, and they messed up one of our iced coffees but we only noticed when we got on the road. Waste of $$$. What a horrible experience and a waste of time.<//Review><Time>1560036910205</Time><rating>1< /rating><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Safeway keeps getting worse and worse as far as checkers, prices, and products go. They never have more than 2 checkers on the busiest nights.  This happens every single weekend I'm in here. What gives, Safeway? I know several qualified people who have applied for part time jobs there and never even got a call back. It's apparent you need help. Hire more people! And they keep raising prices to the point that shopping at sprouts or trader joes will become my norm. I get more bang for my buck at those two stores and they actually have the items in stock, which is something Safeway is lacking these days.< /Review>< rate>

<Text>It's ok.but some times there are 6 people in each  line and just 2 cashiers. 15 mins in line to check-out.they need to call up cashiers quicker.have a few more 10 items or less cashier ready at all times.I will still shop at Safeway but it's not the place for a quick in and out.it's o.k. but not the best.<//Text>< pics>

I shop here often,  and the store is clean, but it is not possible to quickly pop into the store to grab a few things. Check out is painful, even at self checkout since the computer frequently needs approvals. They have a  lot of registers, but usually only 1-2 are open most times. Also all the amount displays in the isles are getting out of hand. They are just in the way.< /Text>

Worth it if you sign up for the 'club' discounts.  There's no fee so I don't understand why people don't. Use the self check out though if you can.< /Text>

Got my FIT bike taken from inside the store last night around midnight, and out of the 6 or more employees working the cash register or collecting the shopping carts out front NO ONE?? had seen a thing...  I bet tho if I even remotely glanced towards the exits, with my things in a bag, leaving the register, receipt in hand, people down over at kohl's would kno wat i looked like, which way I had went, better yet, they'd probably have someone on the phone who has been following me since I walked out the store.... This town n the folks in it are a JOKE!!</text>
